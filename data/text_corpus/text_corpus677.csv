province 712100 china this manuscript was handled by corrado corradini editor in chief with the assistance of wei hu associate editor soil hydrological properties play a key role in soil hydrological processes however the effect of long term vegetation restoration on soil hydrological properties and the corresponding influencing mechanisms remains poorly understood here three soil hydrological properties including saturated water holding capacity swhc field capacity fc and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks as well as several basic soil properties in the zhifanggou watershed of the loess plateau were investigated the variations in swhc fc and ks under different vegetation restoration types and their dominant influencing factors were analyzed moreover we collected available ks data from peer reviewed publications to determine the land use with the largest ks across the entire loess plateau the results showed that swhc fc and ks were increased after 20 years of vegetation restoration the higher ks was found in shrubland and forest in the whole loess plateau compared with cropland ks in shrubland was increased by 87 10 at 0 20 cm 48 89 at 20 40 cm and 18 37 at 40 100 cm respectively indicating that the impact of revegetation on ks were most obvious in the upper soil layer bulk density bd total porosity tp capillary porosity cp noncapillary porosity ncp and soil organic matter som had a significant effect on swhc fc and ks for different land use types p 0 01 soil porosity i e tp cp and ncp and bd soil chemical properties i e som and ph and soil particle composition explained 93 8 59 2 and 13 4 of the total variance in soil hydrological properties i e swhc fc and ks respectively this indicates that soil porosity and bd are the dominant factors affecting soil hydrological properties moreover soil particle composition played an important role in regulating ks with the contribution of 38 6 the established pedotransfer function ptf of ks using bd clay and silt content had a better performance than two existing ptfs this research provides a more systematic and comprehensive understanding of the soil hydrological effect of vegetation restoration in the loess plateau keywords soil hydrology soil properties saturated hydraulic conductivity vegetation restoration land use change loess plateau 1 introduction the loess plateau is a typical ecological fragile area with severe soil erosion jiao et al 2011 shi and shao 2000 soil erosion not only results in soil degradation in this region but also causes large quantities of sediment flowing into yellow river yu et al 2015 triggering a series of serious problems to control soil erosion and meliorate ecological system the chinese government has implemented large scale vegetation restoration in 1999 the grain for green program gfgp was initiated to reconvert cropland to forest shrubland and grassland in the loess plateau chen et al 2007 the gfgp dramatically changed land use type in the loess plateau and increased vegetation coverage by 28 from 1999 to 2013 chen et al 2015 the runoff and sediment have declined about 26 and 21 respectively due to the extensive vegetation reestablishment operations in the region wang et al 2015 numerous studies have shown that land use change which is induced by vegetation restoration alters soil properties significantly in the loess plateau an et al 2013 deng et al 2013 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2016 yu et al 2015 zhu et al 2010 the interaction between soil and vegetation system stabilizes the soil and increases organic matter and nutrients qi et al 2018 which is conducive to promote land sustainable utilization wang et al 2019 suggested that vegetation restoration significantly decreased the soil bulk density bd and increased the soil porosity they also pointed out that the changes in soil properties are different for different land use types additionally vegetation age and growth status also influence soil properties greatly wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 these inter related soil properties further influence hillslope and watershed hydrology cerdà 1996 jiang et al 2019 which is reflected in soil hydrological properties changes soil hydrological properties largely determine the proportion of precipitation infiltrating into the subsurface versus flowing overland to stream networks tetzlaff et al 2007 zimmermann et al 2006 saturated water holding capacity swhc field capacity fc and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks are generally considered as important soil quality indicators and soil erosion parameters boix fayos et al 2001 also they are recognized as indicators of evaluating the ecological benefits of vegetation restoration in the loess plateau in particularly as one of the most widely used soil hydraulic parameters ks tremendously impacts the processes of soil water infiltration storage and circulation as well as irrigation and drainage aimrun et al 2004 zhang and schaap 2019 ks plays an indispensable role in simulating transport of soil water and solutes cornelis et al 2001 and is regarded as key parameters of distributed hydrological models wang et al 2013 to date many studies have been conducted on ks variation and its influencing factors lewis et al 2012 papanicolaou et al 2015 rienzner and gandolfi 2014 but most of them focused mainly on topsoil 0 20 cm however ignoring subsoil 20 cm research shows that ks is greatly affected by soil depth coquet et al 2005 schwen et al 2014 due to the factors affecting ks varying with depth santra et al 2008 the subsoil hydrological properties are important to the absorption and utilization of water and nutrient for plants kılıç et al 2004 therefore it is necessary to conduct field studies on ks of deep soil which is helpful to better understand the soil hydrological process in recent years the effect of land use type on ks in the loess plateau had been paid more attention and many studies indicated that land use type influences ks significantly peng et al 2010 tan et al 2019 however most studies are conducted in a small scale and the conclusions are inconsistent for example yu et al 2015 reported that grass may be more capable in improving hydraulic conductivity than forest but some studies indicated that forest has higher ks chandler et al 2018 liu et al 2018 these plot scale studies deepened our knowledge of impact of local land use type on ks however the results of these independent case studies are difficult to be extended to the entire loess plateau it is still controversial which land use type experienced the greatest increase in ks after vegetation restoration in the region to extrapolate the plot scale ks data to a larger area we performed a literature review to compile all available ks data at the regional scale and evaluate the most appropriate vegetation restoration in the loess plateau the influence of land use type on ks change could be caused by variations in root structures picciafuoco et al 2019 bd soil organic matter som liu et al 2018 and soil organisms chandler et al 2018 additionally soil porosity soil texture aggregates and ph were also found to be significantly correlated to ks zhang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 all these soil physical and chemical properties may influence ks directly or indirectly zimmermann and elsenbeer 2008 nevertheless the relative contributions of these factors affecting ks variation has not reached a consensus moreover the pedotransfer function ptf was widely used to estimate ks due to direct determination methods were time consuming and labor intensive saxton and rawls 2006 zhao et al 2016 reported that the model for estimating ks using bd silt and clay performed best in the loess plateau tp cp ncp and som were also used in ptf as input factors mao et al 2019 yang et al 2020 however applying ptfs outside the region of design had some limitations thus it is necessary to develop a ptf for the estimation of ks in a typical loess area investigating the variations in soil properties under different land use types and ascertaining the dominant influencing factors of soil hydrological properties i e swhc fc and ks would help to understand the soil hydrological effect of revegetation in the loess plateau the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the response of soil hydrological properties after vegetation restoration 2 reveal the relationship between soil physicochemical properties and hydrological properties and 3 develop a reliable ptf for the estimation of ks in this region 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area this research was conducted in the zhifanggou watershed 109 23 e 109 27 e 36 71 n 36 77 n in northern shaanxi province china the study area 8 6 km2 is located in the central of the loess plateau which is a typical loess hilly and gully area fig 1 the watershed has a continental semi arid climate with mean annual precipitation of 505 mm and annual average temperature of 8 8 c precipitation during july and september accounts for about 61 1 of the total annual precipitation the whole watershed is covered with a thick layer of silt loam loess which is vulnerable to soil erosion the current main land use types include forest shrubland grassland cropland orchard nursery and abandoned land the dominant forest species are robinia pseudoacacia populus simonii and armeniaca sibirica the major shrub species are caragana korshinskii and hippophae rhamnoides and the mian grass species are astragalus adsurgens artemisia gmelinii and stipa bungeana wang et al 2014 2 2 experimental design and soil sampling the field experiment was conducted between may and august 2021 four representative plots with four land use types i e forest shrubland grassland and cropland were selected here the space for time sft substitution approach was used to infer temporal dynamics of soil properties in this study except for cropland the selected plots in the watershed had similar slope aspect elevation and restoration age additionally the forest shrubland and grassland were converted from the cropland the selected cropland has been cultivated continuously for the past 20 years therefore the soil properties at different plots were good for comparative analysis the slope and aspect were measured with a geological compass and the elevation longitude and latitude information were obtained with a gps receiver the restoration age was ascertained from local forest bureaus detailed information of sampling plots is shown in table 1 note the plots had not experienced precipitation for at least two weeks before sampling at the plots of each land use type except for cropland nine points were selected at equal intervals along the slope the sampling intervals of forest shrubland and grassland were 5 m 20 m and 15 m respectively three points were selected equally along the diagonal at cropland at each sampling point a soil pit was dug with the depth of 100 cm a total of 30 soil pits was dug and each soil profile was divided into six layers 0 10 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm in each soil profile six undisturbed soil cores were collected using cutting cylinders volume 100 cm3 in addition disturbed soil samples were collected in zip top plastic bags near each soil pit a total of 30 samples was collected using a soil auger a sampling interval of 10 cm between 0 and 100 cm and a sampling interval of 20 cm between 100 and 500 cm these samples were placed in aluminum boxes for measuring gravimetric soil moisture sm in this paper we only used sm data at the 0 100 cm depth 2 3 soil properties measurement the weights of all the empty cutting cylinders and empty aluminum boxes were obtained before the experiment wcr and wab g in the laboratory sm was measured by mass loss from wet soil samples during oven drying 105 c to constant weight all undisturbed soil samples were first weighed and then placed into a plastic tray filled with distilled water the water level was kept constant throughout the saturation and the water surface was level with the top of the soil to prevent soil from draining we padded the bottom of cutting cylinder with filter paper after ponding for 24 h the saturated soil cores were used to measure vertical ks mm min 1 by constant head method based on darcy s law klute and dirksen 1986 thereafter these saturated soil cores were weighed wsat g and then placed in a tray covered with dry sand to weigh the water drained by gravity after 2 h and 2 days w2h and w2d g jiang et al 2019 li

sieve to determine som g kg 1 using the external potassium dichromate heating method 2 4 literature data source and compilation we conducted literature collection using web of science and cnki china national knowledge infrastructure for all years ending at september 2021 with the search terms saturated hydraulic conductivity or soil properties vegetation restoration or land use change and loess plateau the following criteria were used to select papers 1 the article contained at least one land use type vegetation type i e forest shrubland grassland and cropland farmland 2 the previous land use type was cropland in all cases 3 sampling depth includes both 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm layers or only 0 20 cm layer 4 the number of replications was clearly reported 5 using constant head method to determine ks getdata graph digitizer was used to extract data illustrated in graphs given the differences of soil vegetation meteorological and other geographical factor li et al 1985 wu and yang 1998 the loess plateau was divided into three ecological zones i e ez i ez ii and ez iii to analyze the distribution characteristics of ks extracted in different ecological zones a total of 214 observations appendix s1 in five provinces across the loess plateau of china was collected from 28 individual publications fig 1 2 5 statistical analysis two way analysis of variance anova was performed to evaluate the effects of land use type and soil depth on soil properties least significant difference lsd method was used to test the differences among average values of soil properties under different land use types at the same soil depth redundancy analysis rda was used to identify the relationship between explanatory variables i e bd tp cp ncp som ph clay silt and sand and response variables i e swhc fc and ks the log transformation was performed to weaken the heteroscedasticity of the data in rda monte carlo permutation test was applied to rank the importance of each explanatory variable variance partitioning analysis vpa was performed to quantify the relative contribution of explanatory variables to the change in soil hydrological properties multiple linear regression mlr was used to develop the pedotransfer functions ptfs of ks variance inflation factor vif was used to diagnose multicollinearity the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the accuracy of the ptfs rda and vpa were performed by the r package vegan comparison analysis and mlr were conducted using ibm spss statistics 25 software 3 results 3 1 soil physical properties as shown in fig 2 sm bd tp and cp were all significantly affected by the soil depth land use type and their interaction p 0 05 however ncp was only affected significantly by soil depth p 0 05 in this study the 100 cm depth soil profile was divided into three layers 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 100 cm the conversion of cropland to forest shrubland and grassland significantly decreased sm at three soil layers following the order cropland grassland forest shrubland compared with cropland sm in shrubland decreased by 56 70 at the 0 20 cm 44 70 at the 20 40 cm and 37 65 at the 40 100 cm respectively by comparison no significant difference in bd was observed among four land use types at the 0 20 cm depth forest shrubland and grassland significantly decreased bd at the 20 40 cm depth and only forest significantly decreased bd at the 40 100 cm depth p 0 05 for tp and cp there were no significant difference among four land use types at the 0 20 cm depth at the 20 40 cm depth converting cropland to forest shrubland and grassland resulted in increases in tp and cp p 0 05 for example compared with cropland tp and cp were higher by 16 87 and 18 39 in shrubland at the 40 100 cm however a significant decline in tp and cp was only observed in forest p 0 05 for ncp there was no significant difference among four land use types at different layers fig 2 soil particle size distribution of different land use types at three soil layers is presented in table 2 anova results indicated that soil depth land use type and their interaction had significant effects on clay silt and sand p 0 05 there was no difference in clay among four land use types at the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm but clay in forest and shrubland was significantly higher than that in cropland at the 40 100 cm depth the silt in forest was significantly higher than that in other land use types at three soil layers from soil surface to 40 cm depth silt in shrubland and grassland was generally lower than that in cropland converting cropland to forest generally decreased sand across the 0 100 cm depth while grassland significantly increased sand at the 0 20 cm and significantly decreased sand at the 40 100 cm p 0 05 the difference in sand was not statistically significant between shrubland and cropland table 2 3 2 soil organic matter and ph som and ph were significantly affected by soil depth and land use type p 0 01 fig 3 across the 0 100 cm depth the conversion of cropland to forest shrubland and grassland significantly increased som p 0 05 more specifically the som of different land use types at the 0 20 cm depth followed the order shrubland 5 50 g kg 1 forest 5 34 g kg 1 grassland 4 56 g kg 1 cropland 3 63 g kg 1 in contrast the difference in the 20 40 cm and 40 100 cm depth was that forest had the highest som 3 74 and 3 82 g kg 1 converting cropland to forest shrubland and grassland generally decreased ph across the 0 100 cm depth but only the shrubland was statistically significant at the depth of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm p 0 05 fig 3 3 3 soil hydrological properties the swhc fc and ks generally increased when cropland were transformed into forest shrubland and grassland fig 4 which were higher by 7 27 12 25 32 07 37 94 and 9 62 53 85 across the 0 100 cm depth they were all significantly affected by the soil depth land use type and their interaction p 0 05 as shown in fig 4 the swhc of shrubland 46 97 and 37 60 was the highest at the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depth compared with cropland swhc was higher by 8 20 and 34 14 in shrubland however forest has the highest swhc 34 92 at the 40 100 cm similar characteristics by land use type were also found for fc at different depths compared with cropland fc was significantly increased by 26 50 and 74 71 in shrubland at the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depth p 0 05 while the fc of forest was significantly increased by 32 80 at the 40 100 cm fig 4 the ks of different land uses at the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depth follows the order shrubland 1 16 and 0 67 mm min 1 grassland 1 05 and 0 56 mm min 1 forest 0 75 and 0 52 mm min 1 cropland 0 62 and 0 45 mm min 1 however the highest ks was also observed in shrubland at the 40 100 cm compared with cropland ks in shrubland was significantly increased by 87 10 at the 0 20 cm 48 89 at the 20 40 cm and 18 37 at the 40 100 cm respectively p 0 05 fig 4 the meta analysis results showed that ks of surface layer 0 20 cm was generally higher than that of sub surface layer 20 40 cm under different land use types fig 5 in the ez i forest had the highest median value of ks 1 08 mm min 1 and 0 61 mm min 1 at the depth of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm in the ez ii 0 20 cm the ks in forest and shrubland were significantly higher than those in cropland p 0 01 however in the ez iii ks in grassland were generally higher than those in forest fig 5 although there were differences among the various ecological zone in general shrubland and forest experienced a large increase in ks after vegetation restoration in the loess plateau the findings were consistent with our experimental results 3 4 relationships between soil hydrological properties and soil physicochemical properties the possible relationship between soil hydrological properties and soil physicochemical properties was analyzed using rda nine explanatory variables i e bd tp cp ncp som ph clay silt and sand and three response variables i e swhc fc and ks were selected and the ordination diagram is shown in fig 6 as evident in fig 6 the first rda axis rda1 and second rda axis rda2 showed 94 96 and 3 93 in forest 92 86 and 6 82 in shrubland 96 41 and 3 27 in grassland and 80 98 and 17 98 in cropland respectively the first two rda axes explained nearly 100 of the variance of response variables in forest shrubland grassland and cropland rda2 mainly reflected the changes of clay silt and sand and most other explanatory variables changes were reflected in rda1 the results of monte carlo permutation test indicated that bd tp cp ncp and som had a significant effect on soil hydrological properties for different land use types p 0 01 in general tp cp ncp and som showed significant and positive correlations with swhc fc and ks while bd showed significant and negative correlations with three soil hydrological properties moreover the soil hydrological properties were also affected significantly by ph silt and sand depending on the land use type vpa was performed to quantify the relative contributions of different soil physicochemical properties to changes in soil hydrological properties the soil physical and chemical properties in this study were divided into three categories soil porosity i e tp cp and ncp and bd soil chemical properties i e som and ph and soil particle composition i e clay silt and sand and the vpa results are shown in fig 7 soil porosity and bd soil chemical properties and soil particle composition explained 93 8 59 2 and 13 4 of the observed variations respectively leaving only 4 1 of the variation unexplained p 0 01 if compound effect is not considered soil porosity and bd and soil chemical properties alone explained 33 1 and 2 1 of the total variation respectively soil particle composition alone explained 0 2 of the variation and most of its contribution was shared with soil porosity and bd 15 6 and soil chemical properties 9 6 fig 7a furthermore we quantified the relative contributions of different soil physicochemical properties to changes in ks fig 7b the results showed that soil porosity and bd contributed the most 53 3 followed by soil particle composition 38 6 and soil chemical properties 38 3 p 0 01 soil particle composition alone explained 14 7 of the total variation which was higher than soil porosity and bd 7 8 and soil chemical properties 1 8 compared with considering all three soil hydrological properties together the contribution of soil particle composition to ks remarkably increased and more unexplained variation 31 5 was found in ks these results indicate that soil porosity i e tp cp and ncp and bd were dominant factors affecting variations of soil hydrological properties moreover ks variation may also be affected by other factors such as soil aggregate biomass and root structures 3 5 ptf for ks all the soil samples were used to develop ptf for ks through mlr a stepwise method regression selected explanatory variables at the 0 05 significance level to enter the model and retained the variables in the model using the 0 1 significance level in this study bd clay and silt were selected as explanatory variables for entry in the regression model the value of vif was less than 10 for each variable indicating that there was no multicollinearity among bd clay and silt alin 2010 the final regression equation is as follows 9 k s 6 505 1 561 bd 0 086 silt 0 127 clay the ptf equation explains about 63 7 of variance r2 adj 0 637 p 0 001 to further assess the accuracy of the locally developed ptf two sets of existing ptfs ptf 1 and ptf 2 in wösten et al 1999 and weynants et al 2009 were applied to estimate ks under different land use types and their estimating performances were compared to that of the ptfs developed in this study two evaluation indices i e rmse and r 2 of different ptfs are given in table 3 as seen in table 3 the ptf of this study had a better performance than the two existing ptfs in estimating ks under four land use types note that all ptfs had the worst prediction performance for ks in cropland this may be due to the soil properties of cropland are quite different from those of forest shrubland and grassland our results further confirmed the limitation of applying ptfs outside the region of design the ptf developed in this study could provide reference for prediction of ks locally 4 discussion 4 1 effects of vegetation restoration on soil physicochemical properties large scale vegetation restoration profoundly influences soil properties such as soil structure and fertility wu et al 2016 the response of soil physical and chemical properties to land use change varies with land use type qi et al 2018 and soil depth jiang et al 2019 our results showed that vegetation restoration significantly decreased sm at the 0 100 cm depth and bd at the 20 40 cm depth but significantly increased tp and cp at the 20 40 cm depth at the 40 100 cm depth only forest significantly decreased bd and increased tp and cp vegetation restoration increased leaf interception root water uptake and evapotranspiration which decreased sm in the loess plateau huang and gallichand 2006 jia et al 2017 jian et al 2015 here we also found that the sm of forest was higher than that of shrubland which was closely related to the surface soil evaporation by forest canopy in summer liu et al 2013 vegetation restoration plays a notable role in increasing porosity and improving soil structure jiao et al 2011 tan et al 2019 found that bd of grassland was significantly higher than that of cropland while tp and cp changes in contrast in this study however there was no significant change in bd tp and cp at the 0 20 cm depth after revegetation this may be due to human disturbance on tillage layer at the seedling stage of maize compared with shrubland and grass the effect of forest on bd tp and cp was more obvious at the 40 100 cm depth which was caused mainly by strong root systems of forest our results showed that vegetation restoration generally increased som one of the most important reasons is that the litter floor in tree and bush and abundant grass roots protected soil erosion but plant litter and the protection effects in cropland were almost deprived li et al 2020 in addition higher soil respiration of cropland due to cultivation coupled with the absorption and harvest of crops accelerated the decomposition and loss of som post and kwon 2000 the ph of cropland was generally higher than that of forest shrubland and grassland high soil temperature and sm of cropland will increase surface evaporation and thus lead to high soil salinity increasing soil ph zhao et al 2019 land conversion has an important impact on the change of soil particle composition wu et al 2015 herein we found that converting cropland to forest generally increased clay and silt but decreased sand the fine soil particles washed from the upper hillside and deposited in the forest which increased the clay of forest moreover the forest litter could protect the topsoil and prevent the loss of fine particles zhao et al 2015 4 2 response of soil hydrological properties to soil physicochemical properties soil physical properties and chemical properties clearly affects soil hydrological properties zimmermann and elsenbeer 2008 the variations of soil texture soil porosity bd and som change the soil water retention and soil hydraulic conductivity thereby altering the soil water availability folgarait et al 2003 which is generally consistent with our results soil pore structure determines the speed of water entering and moving through soils uteau et al 2013 vegetation restoration reduces bd and increases soil porosity including tp cp and ncp leading to high soil hydraulic conductivity and water retention liang et al 2009 mao et al 2019 cp and ncp mainly reflect the micropores and macropores respectively fu et al 2021 the soil pore size distribution affects the soil hydrological properties ming et al 2020 pan et al 2017 indicated that soil porosity is the dominant factor affecting ks and fc in alpine mountainous region meanwhile they concluded that ncp explains 97 3 of total variance in ks and cp explains 91 1 of total variance in fc these findings are generally consistent with our results though their experiments were done in the different region several research indicated that ks variation is highly affected by macropore characteristics e g the number and volume of macropore logsdon et al 1990 zhang et al 2019 however the relationship between soil hydrological properties and macropore characteristics in the loess plateau will require further studies which are beyond the scope of this study in addition to soil porosity and bd our results showed that som has a significant positive correlation with soil hydrological properties fig 6 som is considered to be the most important cementing material for the formation and stabilization of soil structure which reduces bd celik et al 2010 and increases porosity khan et al 2000 soil aggregation garcía orenes et al 2005 water retention nyamangara et al 2001 and soil hydraulic conductivity kuncoro et al 2014 however some studies have pointed out that ks first increased and then decreased with increasing soil organic carbon soc and the inflection point was about 28 38 g kg 1 peng et al 2010 when soc was more than 28 38 g kg 1 the promotion of soil structure improvement on hydraulic conductivity was less than the inhibition of organic carbon adsorption which hindered or delayed the infiltration liang et al 2009 mao et al 2019 this phenomenon was not observed in the present study due to lower som the ph measured in this experiment was from 7 82 to 8 41 within this range the decrease of ph may reduce the microbial activity francis 1986 thus accelerating the decomposition rate of som and indirectly affecting soil hydrological properties negatively soil particle composition also plays an important role in regulating soil hydrological properties especially ks however relative to other soil physical and chemical properties the relationship between soil particle composition and soil hydrological properties is more complicated for example clay content is positively correlated with ks in forest and shrubland but negatively correlated with ks in grassland and cropland fig 6 the effect of soil particle composition towards soil hydrological properties may be specific to land use type 4 3 implications for land management vegetation restoration is a major biological measure to alleviate soil erosion in the loess plateau nan et al 2019 land conversion profoundly changes the regional cover pattern and underlying surface conditions and thus dramatically alters soil hydrological properties and water cycling processes peng et al 2010 tan et al 2019 the conceptual visualization in fig 8 outlines the soil properties and general soil hydrological processes changes when cropland is converted to forest revegetation enhances soil hydraulic conductivity and water retention and further reduces surface runoff increase soil infiltration and plant water storage yu et al 2015 previous studies have shown that limited rainfall is the only source of soil water in the loess plateau jia et al 2017 therefore improving the storage and utilization efficiency of the scarce precipitation is critical for vegetation construction and ecological restoration of the loess plateau our findings indicate that forest and shrubland experienced a large increase in ks after vegetation restoration this implies that afforestation could promote infiltration capacity and further reduce surface runoff which could reduce soil erosion effectively however forests represented by robinia pseudoacacia and shrubs represented by caragana korshinskii are both characterized by deep roots resulting in soil desiccation chen et al 2010 qiu et al 2021 xiao et al 2014 conversely serious soil water depletion causes a negative effect on plant growth and development jia et al 2017 many studies have shown that the conversion of cropland into grassland may be the most appropriate way for vegetation restoration in the loess plateau yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 in this study although grassland is not optimal in enhancing soil hydrological properties the soil moisture in grassland is higher than that of forest and shrubland an important prerequisite for vegetation restoration is to maintain a sustainable soil water resource especially in arid and semi arid areas with insufficient rainwater supply in the future ecological restoration we should therefore strike a balance between preventing soil erosion and rational utilization of soil water resources it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the ecological benefits of vegetation restoration based on soil properties under different land use types thus selecting suitable vegetation type for ecological construction of the loess plateau 5 conclusions we studied the variations in saturated water holding capacity swhc field capacity fc and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks under different vegetation restoration types and their dominant influencing factors in the zhifanggou watershed of the loess plateau moreover we collected all available ks data to determine the land use with the largest ks across the entire loess plateau in summary vegetation restoration increased swhc fc and ks the ks values of shrubland and forest were generally higher than those of grassland in the watershed and the whole loess plateau compared with cropland ks in shrubland was increased by 87 10 at 0 20 cm 48 89 at 20 40 cm and 18 37 at 40 100 cm respectively indicating that the effect of vegetation restoration on ks was mostly concentrated in the topsoil bulk density bd total porosity tp capillary porosity cp noncapillary porosity ncp and soil organic matter som had significant effects on swhc fc and ks for different land use types p 0 01 changes in soil hydrological properties i e swhc fc and ks are mainly controlled by soil porosity i e tp cp and ncp and bd during revegetation process with the contribution of 93 8 soil chemical properties som and ph and soil particle composition explained 59 2 and 13 4 of the total variance in soil hydrological properties i e swhc fc and ks respectively moreover soil particle composition is an important influencing factor of ks which explained 38 6 of the total variance the pedotransfer function ptf for estimating ks was derived from bd clay and silt and showed a better performance compared to two existing ptfs our findings contribute to comprehensive understand the soil hydrological effects of vegetation restoration in the loess plateau planners should carefully assess these effects and select suitable vegetation types and management measures to achieve the purpose of ecological restoration in the loess plateau and similar regions credit authorship contribution statement dexun qiu conceptualization methodology resources investigation data curation writing

province 712100 china this manuscript was handled by corrado corradini editor in chief with the assistance of wei hu associate editor soil hydrological properties play a key role in soil hydrological processes however the effect of long term vegetation restoration on soil hydrological properties and the corresponding influencing mechanisms remains poorly understood here three soil hydrological properties including saturated water holding capacity swhc field capacity fc and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks as well as several basic soil properties in the zhifanggou watershed of the loess plateau were investigated the variations in swhc fc and ks under different vegetation restoration types and their dominant influencing factors were analyzed moreover we collected available ks data from peer reviewed publications to determine the land use with the largest ks across the entire loess plateau the results showed that swhc fc and ks were increased after 20 years of vegetation restoration the higher ks was found in shrubland and forest in the whole loess plateau compared with cropland ks in shrubland was increased by 87 10 at 0 20 cm 48 89 at 20 40 cm and 18 37 at 40 100 cm respectively indicating that the impact of revegetation on ks were most obvious in the upper soil layer bulk density bd total porosity tp capillary porosity cp noncapillary porosity ncp and soil organic matter som had a significant effect on swhc fc and ks for different land use types p 0 01 soil porosity i e tp cp and ncp and bd soil chemical properties i e som and ph and soil particle composition explained 93 8 59 2 and 13 4 of the total variance in soil hydrological properties i e swhc fc and ks respectively this indicates that soil porosity and bd are the dominant factors affecting soil hydrological properties moreover soil particle composition played an important role in regulating ks with the contribution of 38 6 the established pedotransfer function ptf of ks using bd clay and silt content had a better performance than two existing ptfs this research provides a more systematic and comprehensive understanding of the soil hydrological effect of vegetation restoration in the loess plateau keywords soil hydrology soil properties saturated hydraulic conductivity vegetation restoration land use change loess plateau 1 introduction the loess plateau is a typical ecological fragile area with severe soil erosion jiao et al 2011 shi and shao 2000 soil erosion not only results in soil degradation in this region but also causes large quantities of sediment flowing into yellow river yu et al 2015 triggering a series of serious problems to control soil erosion and meliorate ecological system the chinese government has implemented large scale vegetation restoration in 1999 the grain for green program gfgp was initiated to reconvert cropland to forest shrubland and grassland in the loess plateau chen et al 2007 the gfgp dramatically changed land use type in the loess plateau and increased vegetation coverage by 28 from 1999 to 2013 chen et al 2015 the runoff and sediment have declined about 26 and 21 respectively due to the extensive vegetation reestablishment operations in the region wang et al 2015 numerous studies have shown that land use change which is induced by vegetation restoration alters soil properties significantly in the loess plateau an et al 2013 deng et al 2013 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2016 yu et al 2015 zhu et al 2010 the interaction between soil and vegetation system stabilizes the soil and increases organic matter and nutrients qi et al 2018 which is conducive to promote land sustainable utilization wang et al 2019 suggested that vegetation restoration significantly decreased the soil bulk density bd and increased the soil porosity they also pointed out that the changes in soil properties are different for different land use types additionally vegetation age and growth status also influence soil properties greatly wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 these inter related soil properties further influence hillslope and watershed hydrology cerdà 1996 jiang et al 2019 which is reflected in soil hydrological properties changes soil hydrological properties largely determine the proportion of precipitation infiltrating into the subsurface versus flowing overland to stream networks tetzlaff et al 2007 zimmermann et al 2006 saturated water holding capacity swhc field capacity fc and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks are generally considered as important soil quality indicators and soil erosion parameters boix fayos et al 2001 also they are recognized as indicators of evaluating the ecological benefits of vegetation restoration in the loess plateau in particularly as one of the most widely used soil hydraulic parameters ks tremendously impacts the processes of soil water infiltration storage and circulation as well as irrigation and drainage aimrun et al 2004 zhang and schaap 2019 ks plays an indispensable role in simulating transport of soil water and solutes cornelis et al 2001 and is regarded as key parameters of distributed hydrological models wang et al 2013 to date many studies have been conducted on ks variation and its influencing factors lewis et al 2012 papanicolaou et al 2015 rienzner and gandolfi 2014 but most of them focused mainly on topsoil 0 20 cm however ignoring subsoil 20 cm research shows that ks is greatly affected by soil depth coquet et al 2005 schwen et al 2014 due to the factors affecting ks varying with depth santra et al 2008 the subsoil hydrological properties are important to the absorption and utilization of water and nutrient for plants kılıç et al 2004 therefore it is necessary to conduct field studies on ks of deep soil which is helpful to better understand the soil hydrological process in recent years the effect of land use type on ks in the loess plateau had been paid more attention and many studies indicated that land use type influences ks significantly peng et al 2010 tan et al 2019 however most studies are conducted in a small scale and the conclusions are inconsistent for example yu et al 2015 reported that grass may be more capable in improving hydraulic conductivity than forest but some studies indicated that forest has higher ks chandler et al 2018 liu et al 2018 these plot scale studies deepened our knowledge of impact of local land use type on ks however the results of these independent case studies are difficult to be extended to the entire loess plateau it is still controversial which land use type experienced the greatest increase in ks after vegetation restoration in the region to extrapolate the plot scale ks data to a larger area we performed a literature review to compile all available ks data at the regional scale and evaluate the most appropriate vegetation restoration in the loess plateau the influence of land use type on ks change could be caused by variations in root structures picciafuoco et al 2019 bd soil organic matter som liu et al 2018 and soil organisms chandler et al 2018 additionally soil porosity soil texture aggregates and ph were also found to be significantly correlated to ks zhang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 all these soil physical and chemical properties may influence ks directly or indirectly zimmermann and elsenbeer 2008 nevertheless the relative contributions of these factors affecting ks variation has not reached a consensus moreover the pedotransfer function ptf was widely used to estimate ks due to direct determination methods were time consuming and labor intensive saxton and rawls 2006 zhao et al 2016 reported that the model for estimating ks using bd silt and clay performed best in the loess plateau tp cp ncp and som were also used in ptf as input factors mao et al 2019 yang et al 2020 however applying ptfs outside the region of design had some limitations thus it is necessary to develop a ptf for the estimation of ks in a typical loess area investigating the variations in soil properties under different land use types and ascertaining the dominant influencing factors of soil hydrological properties i e swhc fc and ks would help to understand the soil hydrological effect of revegetation in the loess plateau the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the response of soil hydrological properties after vegetation restoration 2 reveal the relationship between soil physicochemical properties and hydrological properties and 3 develop a reliable ptf for the estimation of ks in this region 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area this research was conducted in the zhifanggou watershed 109 23 e 109 27 e 36 71 n 36 77 n in northern shaanxi province china the study area 8 6 km2 is located in the central of the loess plateau which is a typical loess hilly and gully area fig 1 the watershed has a continental semi arid climate with mean annual precipitation of 505 mm and annual average temperature of 8 8 c precipitation during july and september accounts for about 61 1 of the total annual precipitation the whole watershed is covered with a thick layer of silt loam loess which is vulnerable to soil erosion the current main land use types include forest shrubland grassland cropland orchard nursery and abandoned land the dominant forest species are robinia pseudoacacia populus simonii and armeniaca sibirica the major shrub species are caragana korshinskii and hippophae rhamnoides and the mian grass species are astragalus adsurgens artemisia gmelinii and stipa bungeana wang et al 2014 2 2 experimental design and soil sampling the field experiment was conducted between may and august 2021 four representative plots with four land use types i e forest shrubland grassland and cropland were selected here the space for time sft substitution approach was used to infer temporal dynamics of soil properties in this study except for cropland the selected plots in the watershed had similar slope aspect elevation and restoration age additionally the forest shrubland and grassland were converted from the cropland the selected cropland has been cultivated continuously for the past 20 years therefore the soil properties at different plots were good for comparative analysis the slope and aspect were measured with a geological compass and the elevation longitude and latitude information were obtained with a gps receiver the restoration age was ascertained from local forest bureaus detailed information of sampling plots is shown in table 1 note the plots had not experienced precipitation for at least two weeks before sampling at the plots of each land use type except for cropland nine points were selected at equal intervals along the slope the sampling intervals of forest shrubland and grassland were 5 m 20 m and 15 m respectively three points were selected equally along the diagonal at cropland at each sampling point a soil pit was dug with the depth of 100 cm a total of 30 soil pits was dug and each soil profile was divided into six layers 0 10 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm in each soil profile six undisturbed soil cores were collected using cutting cylinders volume 100 cm3 in addition disturbed soil samples were collected in zip top plastic bags near each soil pit a total of 30 samples was collected using a soil auger a sampling interval of 10 cm between 0 and 100 cm and a sampling interval of 20 cm between 100 and 500 cm these samples were placed in aluminum boxes for measuring gravimetric soil moisture sm in this paper we only used sm data at the 0 100 cm depth 2 3 soil properties measurement the weights of all the empty cutting cylinders and empty aluminum boxes were obtained before the experiment wcr and wab g in the laboratory sm was measured by mass loss from wet soil samples during oven drying 105 c to constant weight all undisturbed soil samples were first weighed and then placed into a plastic tray filled with distilled water the water level was kept constant throughout the saturation and the water surface was level with the top of the soil to prevent soil from draining we padded the bottom of cutting cylinder with filter paper after ponding for 24 h the saturated soil cores were used to measure vertical ks mm min 1 by constant head method based on darcy s law klute and dirksen 1986 thereafter these saturated soil cores were weighed wsat g and then placed in a tray covered with dry sand to weigh the water drained by gravity after 2 h and 2 days w2h and w2d g jiang et al 2019 li

national knowledge infrastructure for all years ending at september 2021 with the search terms saturated hydraulic conductivity or soil properties vegetation restoration or land use change and loess plateau the following criteria were used to select papers 1 the article contained at least one land use type vegetation type i e forest shrubland grassland and cropland farmland 2 the previous land use type was cropland in all cases 3 sampling depth includes both 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm layers or only 0 20 cm layer 4 the number of replications was clearly reported 5 using constant head method to determine ks getdata graph digitizer was used to extract data illustrated in graphs given the differences of soil vegetation meteorological and other geographical factor li et al 1985 wu and yang 1998 the loess plateau was divided into three ecological zones i e ez i ez ii and ez iii to analyze the distribution characteristics of ks extracted in different ecological zones a total of 214 observations appendix s1 in five provinces across the loess plateau of china was collected from 28 individual publications fig 1 2 5 statistical analysis two way analysis of variance anova was performed to evaluate the effects of land use type and soil depth on soil properties least significant difference lsd method was used to test the differences among average values of soil properties under different land use types at the same soil depth redundancy analysis rda was used to identify the relationship between explanatory variables i e bd tp cp ncp som ph clay silt and sand and response variables i e swhc fc and ks the log transformation was performed to weaken the heteroscedasticity of the data in rda monte carlo permutation test was applied to rank the importance of each explanatory variable variance partitioning analysis vpa was performed to quantify the relative contribution of explanatory variables to the change in soil hydrological properties multiple linear regression mlr was used to develop the pedotransfer functions ptfs of ks variance inflation factor vif was used to diagnose multicollinearity the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the accuracy of the ptfs rda and vpa were performed by the r package vegan comparison analysis and mlr were conducted using ibm spss statistics 25 software 3 results 3 1 soil physical properties as shown in fig 2 sm bd tp and cp were all significantly affected by the soil depth land use type and their interaction p 0 05 however ncp was only affected significantly by soil depth p 0 05 in this study the 100 cm depth soil profile was divided into three layers 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 100 cm the conversion of cropland to forest shrubland and grassland significantly decreased sm at three soil layers following the order cropland grassland forest shrubland compared with cropland sm in shrubland decreased by 56 70 at the 0 20 cm 44 70 at the 20 40 cm and 37 65 at the 40 100 cm respectively by comparison no significant difference in bd was observed among four land use types at the 0 20 cm depth forest shrubland and grassland significantly decreased bd at the 20 40 cm depth and only forest significantly decreased bd at the 40 100 cm depth p 0 05 for tp and cp there were no significant difference among four land use types at the 0 20 cm depth at the 20 40 cm depth converting cropland to forest shrubland and grassland resulted in increases in tp and cp p 0 05 for example compared with cropland tp and cp were higher by 16 87 and 18 39 in shrubland at the 40 100 cm however a significant decline in tp and cp was only observed in forest p 0 05 for ncp there was no significant difference among four land use types at different layers fig 2 soil particle size distribution of different land use types at three soil layers is presented in table 2 anova results indicated that soil depth land use type and their interaction had significant effects on clay silt and sand p 0 05 there was no difference in clay among four land use types at the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm but clay in forest and shrubland was significantly higher than that in cropland at the 40 100 cm depth the silt in forest was significantly higher than that in other land use types at three soil layers from soil surface to 40 cm depth silt in shrubland and grassland was generally lower than that in cropland converting cropland to forest generally decreased sand across the 0 100 cm depth while grassland significantly increased sand at the 0 20 cm and significantly decreased sand at the 40 100 cm p 0 05 the difference in sand was not statistically significant between shrubland and cropland table 2 3 2 soil organic matter and ph som and ph were significantly affected by soil depth and land use type p 0 01 fig 3 across the 0 100 cm depth the conversion of cropland to forest shrubland and grassland significantly increased som p 0 05 more specifically the som of different land use types at the 0 20 cm depth followed the order shrubland 5 50 g kg 1 forest 5 34 g kg 1 grassland 4 56 g kg 1 cropland 3 63 g kg 1 in contrast the difference in the 20 40 cm and 40 100 cm depth was that forest had the highest som 3 74 and 3 82 g kg 1 converting cropland to forest shrubland and grassland generally decreased ph across the 0 100 cm depth but only the shrubland was statistically significant at the depth of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm p 0 05 fig 3 3 3 soil hydrological properties the swhc fc and ks generally increased when cropland were transformed into forest shrubland and grassland fig 4 which were higher by 7 27 12 25 32 07 37 94 and 9 62 53 85 across the 0 100 cm depth they were all significantly affected by the soil depth land use type and their interaction p 0 05 as shown in fig 4 the swhc of shrubland 46 97 and 37 60 was the highest at the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depth compared with cropland swhc was higher by 8 20 and 34 14 in shrubland however forest has the highest swhc 34 92 at the 40 100 cm similar characteristics by land use type were also found for fc at different depths compared with cropland fc was significantly increased by 26 50 and 74 71 in shrubland at the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depth p 0 05 while the fc of forest was significantly increased by 32 80 at the 40 100 cm fig 4 the ks of different land uses at the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depth follows the order shrubland 1 16 and 0 67 mm min 1 grassland 1 05 and 0 56 mm min 1 forest 0 75 and 0 52 mm min 1 cropland 0 62 and 0 45 mm min 1 however the highest ks was also observed in shrubland at the 40 100 cm compared with cropland ks in shrubland was significantly increased by 87 10 at the 0 20 cm 48 89 at the 20 40 cm and 18 37 at the 40 100 cm respectively p 0 05 fig 4 the meta analysis results showed that ks of surface layer 0 20 cm was generally higher than that of sub surface layer 20 40 cm under different land use types fig 5 in the ez i forest had the highest median value of ks 1 08 mm min 1 and 0 61 mm min 1 at the depth of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm in the ez ii 0 20 cm the ks in forest and shrubland were significantly higher than those in cropland p 0 01 however in the ez iii ks in grassland were generally higher than those in forest fig 5 although there were differences among the various ecological zone in general shrubland and forest experienced a large increase in ks after vegetation restoration in the loess plateau the findings were consistent with our experimental results 3 4 relationships between soil hydrological properties and soil physicochemical properties the possible relationship between soil hydrological properties and soil physicochemical properties was analyzed using rda nine explanatory variables i e bd tp cp ncp som ph clay silt and sand and three response variables i e swhc fc and ks were selected and the ordination diagram is shown in fig 6 as evident in fig 6 the first rda axis rda1 and second rda axis rda2 showed 94 96 and 3 93 in forest 92 86 and 6 82 in shrubland 96 41 and 3 27 in grassland and 80 98 and 17 98 in cropland respectively the first two rda axes explained nearly 100 of the variance of response variables in forest shrubland grassland and cropland rda2 mainly reflected the changes of clay silt and sand and most other explanatory variables changes were reflected in rda1 the results of monte carlo permutation test indicated that bd tp cp ncp and som had a significant effect on soil hydrological properties for different land use types p 0 01 in general tp cp ncp and som showed significant and positive correlations with swhc fc and ks while bd showed significant and negative correlations with three soil hydrological properties moreover the soil hydrological properties were also affected significantly by ph silt and sand depending on the land use type vpa was performed to quantify the relative contributions of different soil physicochemical properties to changes in soil hydrological properties the soil physical and chemical properties in this study were divided into three categories soil porosity i e tp cp and ncp and bd soil chemical properties i e som and ph and soil particle composition i e clay silt and sand and the vpa results are shown in fig 7 soil porosity and bd soil chemical properties and soil particle composition explained 93 8 59 2 and 13 4 of the observed variations respectively leaving only 4 1 of the variation unexplained p 0 01 if compound effect is not considered soil porosity and bd and soil chemical properties alone explained 33 1 and 2 1 of the total variation respectively soil particle composition alone explained 0 2 of the variation and most of its contribution was shared with soil porosity and bd 15 6 and soil chemical properties 9 6 fig 7a furthermore we quantified the relative contributions of different soil physicochemical properties to changes in ks fig 7b the results showed that soil porosity and bd contributed the most 53 3 followed by soil particle composition 38 6 and soil chemical properties 38 3 p 0 01 soil particle composition alone explained 14 7 of the total variation which was higher than soil porosity and bd 7 8 and soil chemical properties 1 8 compared with considering all three soil hydrological properties together the contribution of soil particle composition to ks remarkably increased and more unexplained variation 31 5 was found in ks these results indicate that soil porosity i e tp cp and ncp and bd were dominant factors affecting variations of soil hydrological properties moreover ks variation may also be affected by other factors such as soil aggregate biomass and root structures 3 5 ptf for ks all the soil samples were used to develop ptf for ks through mlr a stepwise method regression selected explanatory variables at the 0 05 significance level to enter the model and retained the variables in the model using the 0 1 significance level in this study bd clay and silt were selected as explanatory variables for entry in the regression model the value of vif was less than 10 for each variable indicating that there was no multicollinearity among bd clay and silt alin 2010 the final regression equation is as follows 9 k s 6 505 1 561 bd 0 086 silt 0 127 clay the ptf equation explains about 63 7 of variance r2 adj 0 637 p 0 001 to further assess the accuracy of the locally developed ptf two sets of existing ptfs ptf 1 and ptf 2 in wösten et al 1999 and weynants et al 2009 were applied to estimate ks under different land use types and their estimating performances were compared to that of the ptfs developed in this study two evaluation indices i e rmse and r 2 of different ptfs are given in table 3 as seen in table 3 the ptf of this study had a better performance than the two existing ptfs in estimating ks under four land use types note that all ptfs had the worst prediction performance for ks in cropland this may be due to the soil properties of cropland are quite different from those of forest shrubland and grassland our results further confirmed the limitation of applying ptfs outside the region of design the ptf developed in this study could provide reference for prediction of ks locally 4 discussion 4 1 effects of vegetation restoration on soil physicochemical properties large scale vegetation restoration profoundly influences soil properties such as soil structure and fertility wu et al 2016 the response of soil physical and chemical properties to land use change varies with land use type qi et al 2018 and soil depth jiang et al 2019 our results showed that vegetation restoration significantly decreased sm at the 0 100 cm depth and bd at the 20 40 cm depth but significantly increased tp and cp at the 20 40 cm depth at the 40 100 cm depth only forest significantly decreased bd and increased tp and cp vegetation restoration increased leaf interception root water uptake and evapotranspiration which decreased sm in the loess plateau huang and gallichand 2006 jia et al 2017 jian et al 2015 here we also found that the sm of forest was higher than that of shrubland which was closely related to the surface soil evaporation by forest canopy in summer liu et al 2013 vegetation restoration plays a notable role in increasing porosity and improving soil structure jiao et al 2011 tan et al 2019 found that bd of grassland was significantly higher than that of cropland while tp and cp changes in contrast in this study however there was no significant change in bd tp and cp at the 0 20 cm depth after revegetation this may be due to human disturbance on tillage layer at the seedling stage of maize compared with shrubland and grass the effect of forest on bd tp and cp was more obvious at the 40 100 cm depth which was caused mainly by strong root systems of forest our results showed that vegetation restoration generally increased som one of the most important reasons is that the litter floor in tree and bush and abundant grass roots protected soil erosion but plant litter and the protection effects in cropland were almost deprived li et al 2020 in addition higher soil respiration of cropland due to cultivation coupled with the absorption and harvest of crops accelerated the decomposition and loss of som post and kwon 2000 the ph of cropland was generally higher than that of forest shrubland and grassland high soil temperature and sm of cropland will increase surface evaporation and thus lead to high soil salinity increasing soil ph zhao et al 2019 land conversion has an important impact on the change of soil particle composition wu et al 2015 herein we found that converting cropland to forest generally increased clay and silt but decreased sand the fine soil particles washed from the upper hillside and deposited in the forest which increased the clay of forest moreover the forest litter could protect the topsoil and prevent the loss of fine particles zhao et al 2015 4 2 response of soil hydrological properties to soil physicochemical properties soil physical properties and chemical properties clearly affects soil hydrological properties zimmermann and elsenbeer 2008 the variations of soil texture soil porosity bd and som change the soil water retention and soil hydraulic conductivity thereby altering the soil water availability folgarait et al 2003 which is generally consistent with our results soil pore structure determines the speed of water entering and moving through soils uteau et al 2013 vegetation restoration reduces bd and increases soil porosity including tp cp and ncp leading to high soil hydraulic conductivity and water retention liang et al 2009 mao et al 2019 cp and ncp mainly reflect the micropores and macropores respectively fu et al 2021 the soil pore size distribution affects the soil hydrological properties ming et al 2020 pan et al 2017 indicated that soil porosity is the dominant factor affecting ks and fc in alpine mountainous region meanwhile they concluded that ncp explains 97 3 of total variance in ks and cp explains 91 1 of total variance in fc these findings are generally consistent with our results though their experiments were done in the different region several research indicated that ks variation is highly affected by macropore characteristics e g the number and volume of macropore logsdon et al 1990 zhang et al 2019 however the relationship between soil hydrological properties and macropore characteristics in the loess plateau will require further studies which are beyond the scope of this study in addition to soil porosity and bd our results showed that som has a significant positive correlation with soil hydrological properties fig 6 som is considered to be the most important cementing material for the formation and stabilization of soil structure which reduces bd celik et al 2010 and increases porosity khan et al 2000 soil aggregation garcía orenes et al 2005 water retention nyamangara et al 2001 and soil hydraulic conductivity kuncoro et al 2014 however some studies have pointed out that ks first increased and then decreased with increasing soil organic carbon soc and the inflection point was about 28 38 g kg 1 peng et al 2010 when soc was more than 28 38 g kg 1 the promotion of soil structure improvement on hydraulic conductivity was less than the inhibition of organic carbon adsorption which hindered or delayed the infiltration liang et al 2009 mao et al 2019 this phenomenon was not observed in the present study due to lower som the ph measured in this experiment was from 7 82 to 8 41 within this range the decrease of ph may reduce the microbial activity francis 1986 thus accelerating the decomposition rate of som and indirectly affecting soil hydrological properties negatively soil particle composition also plays an important role in regulating soil hydrological properties especially ks however relative to other soil physical and chemical properties the relationship between soil particle composition and soil hydrological properties is more complicated for example clay content is positively correlated with ks in forest and shrubland but negatively correlated with ks in grassland and cropland fig 6 the effect of soil particle composition towards soil hydrological properties may be specific to land use type 4 3 implications for land management vegetation restoration is a major biological measure to alleviate soil erosion in the loess plateau nan et al 2019 land conversion profoundly changes the regional cover pattern and underlying surface conditions and thus dramatically alters soil hydrological properties and water cycling processes peng et al 2010 tan et al 2019 the conceptual visualization in fig 8 outlines the soil properties and general soil hydrological processes changes when cropland is converted to forest revegetation enhances soil hydraulic conductivity and water retention and further reduces surface runoff increase soil infiltration and plant water storage yu et al 2015 previous studies have shown that limited rainfall is the only source of soil water in the loess plateau jia et al 2017 therefore improving the storage and utilization efficiency of the scarce precipitation is critical for vegetation construction and ecological restoration of the loess plateau our findings indicate that forest and shrubland experienced a large increase in ks after vegetation restoration this implies that afforestation could promote infiltration capacity and further reduce surface runoff which could reduce soil erosion effectively however forests represented by robinia pseudoacacia and shrubs represented by caragana korshinskii are both characterized by deep roots resulting in soil desiccation chen et al 2010 qiu et al 2021 xiao et al 2014 conversely serious soil water depletion causes a negative effect on plant growth and development jia et al 2017 many studies have shown that the conversion of cropland into grassland may be the most appropriate way for vegetation restoration in the loess plateau yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 in this study although grassland is not optimal in enhancing soil hydrological properties the soil moisture in grassland is higher than that of forest and shrubland an important prerequisite for vegetation restoration is to maintain a sustainable soil water resource especially in arid and semi arid areas with insufficient rainwater supply in the future ecological restoration we should therefore strike a balance between preventing soil erosion and rational utilization of soil water resources it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the ecological benefits of vegetation restoration based on soil properties under different land use types thus selecting suitable vegetation type for ecological construction of the loess plateau 5 conclusions we studied the variations in saturated water holding capacity swhc field capacity fc and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks under different vegetation restoration types and their dominant influencing factors in the zhifanggou watershed of the loess plateau moreover we collected all available ks data to determine the land use with the largest ks across the entire loess plateau in summary vegetation restoration increased swhc fc and ks the ks values of shrubland and forest were generally higher than those of grassland in the watershed and the whole loess plateau compared with cropland ks in shrubland was increased by 87 10 at 0 20 cm 48 89 at 20 40 cm and 18 37 at 40 100 cm respectively indicating that the effect of vegetation restoration on ks was mostly concentrated in the topsoil bulk density bd total porosity tp capillary porosity cp noncapillary porosity ncp and soil organic matter som had significant effects on swhc fc and ks for different land use types p 0 01 changes in soil hydrological properties i e swhc fc and ks are mainly controlled by soil porosity i e tp cp and ncp and bd during revegetation process with the contribution of 93 8 soil chemical properties som and ph and soil particle composition explained 59 2 and 13 4 of the total variance in soil hydrological properties i e swhc fc and ks respectively moreover soil particle composition is an important influencing factor of ks which explained 38 6 of the total variance the pedotransfer function ptf for estimating ks was derived from bd clay and silt and showed a better performance compared to two existing ptfs our findings contribute to comprehensive understand the soil hydrological effects of vegetation restoration in the loess plateau planners should carefully assess these effects and select suitable vegetation types and management measures to achieve the purpose of ecological restoration in the loess plateau and similar regions credit authorship contribution statement dexun qiu conceptualization methodology resources investigation data curation writing

3386,in this paper a new stakeholder based framework is proposed for groundwater resources management in arid regions in this framework rough set theory is used for the probabilistic classification of stakeholders considering their powers and interests which are obtained from stakeholder analysis then a system dynamics model is developed to evaluate the physical economic environmental and social conditions of the system corresponding to each defined water resources management scenario moreover an evidential reasoning approach is used to estimate the resilience of scenarios based on seven generic resilience principles finally based on the results of stakeholder analysis system dynamics modeling and resilience analysis groundwater management scenarios are ranked using a proposed social choice procedure called electoral college voting the results of applying the methodology to the rafsanjan plain in iran illustrate that a scenario that includes modern irrigation systems and water transfer is the socially optimal scenario in the study area implementing this scenario reduces water consumption by 40 improves the resilience of groundwater by about 50 and helps the aquifer to be recovered keywords stakeholder analysis groundwater management resilience electoral college voting rough set theory rafsanjan plain 1 introduction increasing water demand due to population growth and changes in living standards has caused many environmental economic and social problems these problems have made water resource management a critical and challenging task especially in arid and semi arid regions bakhtiari et al 2020 darbandsari et al 2020 policymakers should notice that the water resources systems consist of different physical economic political and social sub systems that interact with each other consequently an integrated study is needed to evaluate water management systems considering the aforementioned aspects madani and mariño 2009 several modeling approaches have been proposed for integrated water resources systems management kelly et al 2013 reviewed five common integrated management models including systems dynamics bayesian networks coupled component models agent based models and knowledge based models also referred to as expert systems as suggested by kelly et al 2013 in this paper the system dynamics approach as a learning tool that fosters system thinking skills and helps improve system understanding is selected for modeling the system and choosing the best groundwater management scenario system dynamics is an applicable tool for identifying sub systems relationships and understanding system behavior over time mirchi et al 2012 an overview of the system dynamics modeling for integrated socio ecological systems can be found in elsawah et al 2017 hassanzadeh et al 2012 developed a system dynamics model to describe factors that affect the water level of lake urmia they showed that overuse of surface water resources and climate change are the main factors that have decreased the lake s water level kotir et al 2016 developed an integrated system dynamics based simulation model to examine interactions between the water resource the population and the agricultural production sub sectors of the volta river basin in west africa they used this model as a decision support tool to evaluate water resource management and agricultural development in the volta river basin also naderi et al 2021 presented a system dynamics based model for water supply to agricultural industrial and urban sectors in the qazvin plain using a food energy water few nexus concept they used system dynamics modeling for conceptualization and analysis of the interconnected few sub systems although system dynamics has been widely used for the integrated simulation of water resources systems social characteristics of stakeholders have been rarely incorporated in the system dynamics based models identifying stakeholders evaluating their characteristics i e stakeholder s powers and interests and considering these characteristics in developing management policies can reduce conflicts among stakeholders prell et al 2009 stakeholder analysis techniques are usually employed to identify stakeholders and determine their attributes ahmadi et al 2019 martínez santos et al 2008 developed a participatory groundwater model for assessing the vulnerability of groundwater resources in this model stakeholders were engaged in designing scenarios and interpreting outputs they applied their model to the mancha occidental aquifer in spain and showed that their model is a valuable social learning tool that provides a transparent framework for stakeholder interaction in a conflict prone area carmona et al 2011 proposed a participatory decision support system for groundwater resources management the decision support system was used to assess the impact of water management scenarios on agricultural and environmental systems they involved stakeholders in decision making process in order to increase public participation and foster social learning mutekanga et al 2013 showed that the success of integrated watershed management programs depends on stakeholders participation therefore stakeholder analysis is necessary for natural resource management ogada et al 2017 used stakeholder analysis to analyze stakeholders social and structural characteristics based on their interests influences and interactions in the lake naivasha basin kenya yang et al 2018 proposed a methodology for the systematic analysis of water resources allocation by considering climate change impacts and stakeholder networks in the dongjiang river basin in southern china ahmadi et al 2020 proposed a decision support system dss for water resources management based on stakeholder analysis results they used physical characteristics of water resources and stakeholders behavior to develop the dss model resilience is the capacity of a system subject to ongoing change to reorganize adapt and retain the same function and structure folke et al 2010 several resilience based approaches have been proposed for evaluating environmental and water resources systems kotzee and reyers 2016 developed an approach to measure flood resilience they defined 24 resilience indicators considering flood and its ecological social economic and infrastructural aspects and aggregated the indicators using principal components analysis pca to form a resilience criterion penny and goddard 2018 reviewed the application of seven generic resilience principles i e maintain diversity and redundancy manage connectivity manage slow variables and feedbacks foster complex adaptive systems thinking encourage learning and experimentation broaden participation and promote polycentric governance systems to evaluate six socio hydrological systems they found that resilience principles play an indispensable role in understanding the resilience of coupled social hydrologic systems balaei et al 2019 proposed a resilience quantification model for water supply systems and used a novel framework to identify the significant social variables in estimating resilience they applied their model to chile and new zealand and showed that the model well explains the differences between water supply resilience of the two countries behboudian et al 2021 and behboudian and kerachian 2021 developed two methodologies for evaluating long term resilience of water resource systems under extreme events they showed that their methodologies can evaluate long term resilience of water supply system better than traditional rrv i e reliability traditional resiliency and vulnerability criteria recently pourmoghim et al 2022 proposed an uncertainty based framework for evaluating and improving the long term resilience of lakes under anthropogenic droughts according to previous studies different methods have evaluated resilience of water resources systems however the seven principles of resilience have not been used for assessing the resilience of large scale groundwater resources the main purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for integrated groundwater resources management based on stakeholder and resilience analysis we develop a system dynamics based simulation model for evaluating the physical economic and environmental aspects of some proposed groundwater management scenarios then for considering the social aspect the rough set theory is used to classify stakeholders according to their powers and interests also a groundwater model is developed in order to simulate aquifer and calculate aquifer response functions finally the results of the stakeholder analysis and system dynamics model are used in a proposed social choice framework to rank groundwater management scenarios based on some hydrologic economic and resilience based criteria the rest of this paper is organized as follows first the proposed methodology is presented and discussed in detail then a brief description of the study area is given and finally the main findings for the application of the methodology to the case study are presented and discussed 2 methodology a flowchart of the methodology is presented in fig 1 in the following sections different parts of the proposed flowchart are discussed 2 1 data and information collection the first step in data collection is identifying the study area s location and its geographic boundaries in order to have a more precise evaluation we divided the study area into some sub areas furthermore we collected the required data for system dynamics modeling i e hydrological and economic characteristics of the study such as rainfall runoff water consumption in each sector and crops production functions and groundwater modeling e g groundwater table porosity piezometric data and exploitation wells data also a questionnaire was designed for conducting interviews with experts and individuals who hold a major stake in the study area in order to identify stakeholders and determine their attributes the designed questionnaire is presented in the online supplementary material 2 2 stakeholder analysis the first step in stakeholder analysis is identifying the main actors and their roles snowball sampling goodman 1961 was used to identify the stakeholders that affect the condition of the system in this paper since stakeholders cannot be classified with complete certainty we used the rough set theory to classify stakeholders the rough set theory which was introduced by zdzistaw 1982 is a mathematical tool to deal with imprecise inconsistent and incomplete information and knowledge in rough set theory two precise boundary lines are considered to describe uncertain and imprecise concepts the rough set theory based model classifies stakeholders through the following phases abed elmdoust and kerachian 2012 abraham et al 2009 1 preprocessing phase a decision table was constructed in this phase in the rough set theory every object is expressed by means of some attributes decision table rows refer to observations called objects and its columns refer to objects attributes provided by experts therefore each cell of the table indicates a description of the object placed in that row by means of the attribute in the related column in other words the decision table divided objects into decision classes according to their attributes a sample of the decision table is shown in table 1 2 attribute reduction and rule generation in this phase redundant attributes are eliminated and main attributes i e a minimal set of attributes discerning one object from others are used for generating decision rules decision rules are logical statements that show the relation between conditional attributes and decision making attributes for example from table 1 we gain the following rules if for a stakeholder annual budget is high access to information is high legal backing is medium and scientific backing is medium then the stakeholder s power is high if for a stakeholder annual budget is high access to information is medium legal backing is low and scientific backing is high then the stakeholder s power is medium 3 probabilistic classification in this phase stakeholders are classified probabilistically in order to determine their decision classes naïve bayes and standard vote are the common methods for classification in the rough set theory olson and delen 2008 in the standard vote method objects are classified by first identifying rules with a matching if part and then by letting these rules cast votes to the decision classes in the corresponding then parts the ratio between the number of votes cast by each decision class and the number of total votes indicates the degree to which objects belong to decision classes naive bayes is a supervised learning algorithm for the classification based on bayes theorem which says 1 p c k p k c p c p k p c k probability of instance k being in class c posterior probability p k c probability of generating instance k given class c likelihood p c probability of occurrence of class c class prior probability p k probability of instance k occurring predictor class probability naive bayes classifier assumes that attributes have independent distribution i e the effect of a particular attribute in a class is independent of other attributes 2 p c k p c 1 k p c 2 k p c n k 3 p c j k p c j n 1 m p c n k p k where m denotes the total number of attributes 2 3 groundwater numerical modeling in this paper we used a three dimensional groundwater model for groundwater simulations the model was created using modflow harbaugh 2005 and the simulations were carried out using groundwater modeling system gms due to changes in pumping rates of wells and impacts of overlapping cones of depression of wells on the groundwater level the spatial location of the point with the highest groundwater table drawdown will change therefore we should calculate an aquifer response function to determine the relationship between the average and maximum groundwater table drawdown the required data for developing the relation between average and maximum groundwater table drawdown was obtained by running the numeral simulation model with different pumping rates many times to evaluate the impact of water management scenarios on sub areas the spatial resolution of the conceptual model should be increased one of the most important elements of the model is the groundwater exchange between sub areas i e inflow from other sub areas and outflow to other sub areas which can be obtained from the regional water budget in the modflow model 2 4 system dynamics modeling system dynamics sd modeling is a conceptual and numerical method that is usually used to understand the structure and behavior of complex systems system dynamics approach not only considers model feedbacks delays and non linear effects but also helps to improve system understanding and system thinking skills kelly et al 2013 stocks and flows are fundamental to the dynamics of complex systems sterman 2000 in system dynamics stocks are accumulations and they characterize the state of the system and create the information upon which decisions and actions are made stocks create delays by accumulating the difference between the inflow to a process and its outflow flow variables are rates which can change stock variables in this paper the system dynamics model consists of two sub systems i e hydrological and environmental sub system and economic sub system which are discussed in the following section 2 4 1 hydrologic and environmental sub system fig 2 presents the stock and flow diagrams of the hydrologic and environmental sub system available water is stock in this sub model and is increased by the total incoming surface and groundwater and decreased by agricultural industrial and municipal water consumptions as well as outgoing flow the total incoming surface water is the sum of runoff total transferred water and surface water inflow from other basins the total incoming groundwater is the sum of infiltration groundwater inflow from other basins and return groundwater flows from water consumptions land subsidence due to groundwater table drawdown can cause many problems such as damages to buildings and infrastructures the land subsidence is calculated as 4 s u z p i 2 p i 1 e where z is aquifer thickness e is the modulus of elasticity of the soil pi1 and pi2 are the granular pressures before and after the drawdown of the groundwater table delleur 1999 2 4 2 economic sub system fig 3 presents the stock and flow diagrams of the economic sub system value added is a stock in this sub model which is increased by the added value from agricultural and industrial sectors and decreased by operational e g pumping cost and maintenance costs pumping cost can be calculated as 5 cos t pumping q h h r 367 η p p where q is the flow rate of pumps m3 year h is head of the pump m hr is pumping operating hours hr year η is pump efficiency and p is the electricity price toman in this sub system we used fisher equation to calculate the real interest rate based on nominal interest rate and inflation rate 6 1 r 1 i 1 π where r is the real interest rate i is the inflation rate and π is the nominal interest rate 2 5 evaluating the resilience of scenarios resilience is the capacity of the system to respond and adapt to anticipated as well as unexpected changes and disturbances walker and salt 2012 there are seven generic principles for enhancing the resilience of the ecosystem services p1 maintain diversity and redundancy p2 manage connectivity p3 manage slow variables and feedbacks p4 foster an understanding of social ecological systems as complex adaptive systems cas p5 encourage learning and experimentation p6 broaden participation and p7 promote polycentric governance systems biggs et al 2012 therefore the resilience of water resources management scenarios can be evaluated by assessing these principles resilience principles are described in table 2 the first step to evaluate the resilience of a scenario was defining and quantifying performance criteria for each principle then the analytical evidential reasoning approach which can tackle multi criteria decision making problems with both quantitative and qualitative criteria under uncertainty motlaghzadeh et al 2020 was used to estimate the total resilience of management scenarios based on the seven resilience principles 2 6 social choice procedure we used social choice procedures in order to aggregate the preferences and interests of decision makers and make a collective and fair decision mahjouri and pourmand 2017 khorasani et al 2018 the first step to rank the scenarios is determining stakeholder s utility functions stakeholders were interviewed to determine the importance of each decision criteria from the stakeholder s perspective then we used the system dynamics based simulation model and the evidential reasoning based approach to estimate the value of each criterion for scenarios hence the total score given to ith scenario by kth stakeholder is calculated as follow 7 s k a i j 1 m u kj d j where uij denotes the importance of jth decision criterion from the viewpoint of kth stakeholder dj is the normalized value of jth decision criterion in the next step we proposed and used the electoral college voting approach to rank the scenarios 2 6 1 electoral college voting approach after assigning scores to scenarios by stakeholders each stakeholder votes for a scenario that obtains more scores from his point of view a stakeholder s number of electoral votes equals the stakeholder s power which is calculated using the rough set theory the possibility of the stakeholders participation in the voting process depends on their interests in other words stakeholders with low interest may not run into the process of ranking scenarios as the rough set theory based model provides the probability density functions for the power and interests of stakeholders stochastic values are assigned to the stakeholder s powers and interests by sampling from the probability density functions and the best scenario is chosen using the social choice method by repeating this process many times and changing stakeholder s power and interest values the winning probability of each scenario is calculated by dividing the number of times it was selected as the winner to the total number of iterations the scenario with the highest probability is considered to be the optimal solution for managing groundwater resources using the electoral college voting approach stakeholders preferences are aggregated and stakeholder analysis results are incorporated in the decision making procedure 3 case study to evaluate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed stakeholder based framework for groundwater resource management the rafsanjan plain in the southeast part of iran was selected this plain is located in 54 52 to 56 34 e and 29 51 to 30 31 n with an area of 12 421 km2 fig 4 table 3 presents a brief overview of the study area the climate of rafsanjan plain is characterized as arid subtropical with 90 mm mean annual rainfall and over 3 000 mm potential evapotranspiration the average annual temperature in rafsanjan is 17 6 c and it has dry winters with an average temperature of 6 c and hot summers with an average temperature of 29 c sayyaf et al 2014 groundwater is the primary source of water supply in rafsanjan plain the annual groundwater discharge in this plain is about 750 million cubic meters and this region currently suffers from an approximately 150 million cubic meters deficit in the groundwater balance as a result of high agricultural and industrial water consumption overexploitation of groundwater resources has caused average and maximum land subsidence of 5 cm year and 20 cm year during the past decade motagh et al 2017 pistachio is the rafsanjan s biggest agricultural commodity which is a perennial crop with a long establishment period and high irrigation demand the establishment time for pistachio tree is about seven years more than 3000 cubic meters of water is required for irrigating one hectare of pistachio trees per year the main characteristics of sub areas which were determined considering the villages boundaries are presented in table 4 4 results 4 1 stakeholder analysis for the identification of main stakeholders which are related to water supply and demand in the study area we interviewed several experts also we used the snowball sampling goodman 1961 to ensure that all stakeholders were identified table 5 presents a list of stakeholders and their main tasks related to groundwater resource management in this study area according to the results of interviews and experts opinions access to information annual budget legal backing and scientific backing are the conditional attributes to describe power as a decision attribute furthermore influence and social responsibility were identified as conditional attributes to characterized stakeholders level of interest some of the rules generated using the rough set theory are presented in table 6 in this paper naive bayes algorithm which requires less training data to estimate classification parameters was applied to classify the stakeholders probabilistically tables 7 and 8 show the probability distribution of the main stakeholders power and interest according to table 7 it can be inferred that rafsanjan regional water company and ministry of agriculture are the most powerful stakeholders in the study area therefore these organizations have more electoral votes than others also according to table 8 rafsanjan regional water company and ministry of agriculture are more likely to participate in the process of ranking scenarios 4 2 groundwater numerical modeling in this paper the rafsanjan aquifer was simulated using the gms model fig 5 the dimension of the aquifer was 27km 20km the continuous domain was replaced by a discretized domain with 250 m 250 m cells therefore the model grid consists of 80 rows and 108 columns the boundary conditions of the aquifer were classified as impermeable or permeable with a specific flow rate fig 5c the groundwater model was calibrated and validated based on head measurements in 96 observation wells from 2006 to 2019 160 stress periods each representing one month 75 of these data were used for the calibration and 25 of them were used for the verification of the groundwater simulation model by comparing observed and simulated hydraulic head values root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute residual error mare in the verification process were calculated as 0 83 and 1 53 m respectively fig 6 the aquifer response function was calculated to determine the relationship between average and maximum groundwater table drawdown a linear regression relation between these two parameters is as follows 8 δ h critical 3 43 δ h average 3 24 r 2 0 975 n s e 0 975 response functions of sub areas and their coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are available in table s2 of the online supplementary material 4 3 system dynamics modeling in this paper system dynamics modeling was employed to simulate water management scenarios developed for the rafsanjan plain the model was run for 20 years with an annual time step to examine the effectiveness of these water management scenarios water management scenarios have been designed in previous studies bagheri and babaeian 2020 management and planning organization of iran 2016 a brief description of each scenario is presented in table 9 the performance of the system dynamics model was evaluated by comparing the average groundwater table calculated using the system dynamics model and the calibrated modflow model fig 7 by comparing the results of sd and modflow models the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient were calculated as 0 98 and 0 96 respectively values of decision criteria which are used in the social choice procedure are estimated using the system dynamics based model variation of the volume of groundwater resources maximum groundwater table drawdown land subsidence initial investment total added value and total employment are the main decision criteria of stakeholders to evaluate the water management scenarios the results of evaluating each scenario are presented in table 10 the corresponding results for sub areas are provided in table s3 s8 of online supplementary material it can be concluded from table 10 that only by using modern irrigation systems and reducing water demands the aquifer can be recovered moreover keeping the current management policies i e the status quo scenario has detrimental effects on the plain also table 10 shows that increasing the area of greenhouses can increase the total value added by 40 4 4 resilience evaluation in this section we estimated the resilience of each water resources management scenario based on the seven generic resilience principles at first different criteria and sub criteria for evaluating each principle were defined table 11 then we employed an analytical evidential reasoning based approach to estimate the total resilience of each scenario table 12 presents the calculated values for the total resilience of the scenarios the corresponding results for sub areas are provided in table s9 s14 in the online supplementary material resilience of each management scenario will be used in the social choice procedure as a decision making criterion 4 5 social choice in this section we rank water management scenarios which were defined in table 9 based on the result of system dynamics modeling stakeholder analysis and their resilience first we calculated the stakeholders utilities for each scenario using eq 7 after assigning scores to the scenarios by each stakeholder they have voted for the scenario which gains more scores from their point of view table 13 presents the total score of each scenario from the view point of stakeholders scores of the management scenario for sub areas are available in tables s15 s20 of online supplementary material note that the number of votes of each stakeholder is equal to its power and possibility of stakeholders voting depends on their interests which is obtained from stakeholder analysis next we used the monte carlo simulation to incorporate the existing uncertainties in stakeholders powers and interests the procedure of ranking scenarios is repeated 1000 times the ranking of the scenarios is presented in table 14 considering the adverse environmental impacts of inter basin water transfer projects khadem et al 2021 zhuang 2016 ranking of the scenarios without incorporating the water transfer project is also presented table 15 ranking of scenarios for sub areas are available in tables s21 s25 in the online supplementary material the results indicate that modern irrigation systems and inter basin water transfer are the best scenario for managing groundwater resources in the rafsanjan plain by considering stakeholders power interest and utility furthermore establishing local water market can be considered as an auxiliary strategy to improve other strategies due to its low initial costs 5 summary and conclusion in this paper we proposed a stakeholder based framework for improving the resilience of groundwater resources in arid regions we used the rough set theory to analyze stakeholders and determine their powers and interests the study area was simulated using the gms model furthermore we developed a system dynamics based simulation model to simulate the proposed groundwater management scenarios and obtain the values of decision making criteria including several criteria based on the seven resilience principles to estimate the total resilience criterion the evidential reasoning approach was applied finally we employed the proposed electoral college voting approach to rank the groundwater management scenarios we applied the developed framework to the rafsnjan plain in iran which is suffering from some water and environmental issues such as severe groundwater table drawdown and land subsidence results showed that using modern irrigation system and inter basin water transfer is the socially optimal and the most preferred scenario for managing groundwater in the study area however the ranking of the other scenarios are different in sub areas also it can be inferred that establishing local water market due to its low initial cost should be taken into account as a supplementary strategy that can be implemented with other water managing scenarios in future

3386,in this paper a new stakeholder based framework is proposed for groundwater resources management in arid regions in this framework rough set theory is used for the probabilistic classification of stakeholders considering their powers and interests which are obtained from stakeholder analysis then a system dynamics model is developed to evaluate the physical economic environmental and social conditions of the system corresponding to each defined water resources management scenario moreover an evidential reasoning approach is used to estimate the resilience of scenarios based on seven generic resilience principles finally based on the results of stakeholder analysis system dynamics modeling and resilience analysis groundwater management scenarios are ranked using a proposed social choice procedure called electoral college voting the results of applying the methodology to the rafsanjan plain in iran illustrate that a scenario that includes modern irrigation systems and water transfer is the socially optimal scenario in the study area implementing this scenario reduces water consumption by 40 improves the resilience of groundwater by about 50 and helps the aquifer to be recovered keywords stakeholder analysis groundwater management resilience electoral college voting rough set theory rafsanjan plain 1 introduction increasing water demand due to population growth and changes in living standards has caused many environmental economic and social problems these problems have made water resource management a critical and challenging task especially in arid and semi arid regions bakhtiari et al 2020 darbandsari et al 2020 policymakers should notice that the water resources systems consist of different physical economic political and social sub systems that interact with each other consequently an integrated study is needed to evaluate water management systems considering the aforementioned aspects madani and mariño 2009 several modeling approaches have been proposed for integrated water resources systems management kelly et al 2013 reviewed five common integrated management models including systems dynamics bayesian networks coupled component models agent based models and knowledge based models also referred to as expert systems as suggested by kelly et al 2013 in this paper the system dynamics approach as a learning tool that fosters system thinking skills and helps improve system understanding is selected for modeling the system and choosing the best groundwater management scenario system dynamics is an applicable tool for identifying sub systems relationships and understanding system behavior over time mirchi et al 2012 an overview of the system dynamics modeling for integrated socio ecological systems can be found in elsawah et al 2017 hassanzadeh et al 2012 developed a system dynamics model to describe factors that affect the water level of lake urmia they showed that overuse of surface water resources and climate change are the main factors that have decreased the lake s water level kotir et al 2016 developed an integrated system dynamics based simulation model to examine interactions between the water resource the population and the agricultural production sub sectors of the volta river basin in west africa they used this model as a decision support tool to evaluate water resource management and agricultural development in the volta river basin also naderi et al 2021 presented a system dynamics based model for water supply to agricultural industrial and urban sectors in the qazvin plain using a food energy water few nexus concept they used system dynamics modeling for conceptualization and analysis of the interconnected few sub systems although system dynamics has been widely used for the integrated simulation of water resources systems social characteristics of stakeholders have been rarely incorporated in the system dynamics based models identifying stakeholders evaluating their characteristics i e stakeholder s powers and interests and considering these characteristics in developing management policies can reduce conflicts among stakeholders prell et al 2009 stakeholder analysis techniques are usually employed to identify stakeholders and determine their attributes ahmadi et al 2019 martínez santos et al 2008 developed a participatory groundwater model for assessing the vulnerability of groundwater resources in this model stakeholders were engaged in designing scenarios and interpreting outputs they applied their model to the mancha occidental aquifer in spain and showed that their model is a valuable social learning tool that provides a transparent framework for stakeholder interaction in a conflict prone area carmona et al 2011 proposed a participatory decision support system for groundwater resources management the decision support system was used to assess the impact of water management scenarios on agricultural and environmental systems they involved stakeholders in decision making process in order to increase public participation and foster social learning mutekanga et al 2013 showed that the success of integrated watershed management programs depends on stakeholders participation therefore stakeholder analysis is necessary for natural resource management ogada et al 2017 used stakeholder analysis to analyze stakeholders social and structural characteristics based on their interests influences and interactions in the lake naivasha basin kenya yang et al 2018 proposed a methodology for the systematic analysis of water resources allocation by considering climate change impacts and stakeholder networks in the dongjiang river basin in southern china ahmadi et al 2020 proposed a decision support system dss for water resources management based on stakeholder analysis results they used physical characteristics of water resources and stakeholders behavior to develop the dss model resilience is the capacity of a system subject to ongoing change to reorganize adapt and retain the same function and structure folke et al 2010 several resilience based approaches have been proposed for evaluating environmental and water resources systems kotzee and reyers 2016 developed an approach to measure flood resilience they defined 24 resilience indicators considering flood and its ecological social economic and infrastructural aspects and aggregated the indicators using principal components analysis pca to form a resilience criterion penny and goddard 2018 reviewed the application of seven generic resilience principles i e maintain diversity and redundancy manage connectivity manage slow variables and feedbacks foster complex adaptive systems thinking encourage learning and experimentation broaden participation and promote polycentric governance systems to evaluate six socio hydrological systems they found that resilience principles play an indispensable role in understanding the resilience of coupled social hydrologic systems balaei et al 2019 proposed a resilience quantification model for water supply systems and used a novel framework to identify the significant social variables in estimating resilience they applied their model to chile and new zealand and showed that the model well explains the differences between water supply resilience of the two countries behboudian et al 2021 and behboudian and kerachian 2021 developed two methodologies for evaluating long term resilience of water resource systems under extreme events they showed that their methodologies can evaluate long term resilience of water supply system better than traditional rrv i e reliability traditional resiliency and vulnerability criteria recently pourmoghim et al 2022 proposed an uncertainty based framework for evaluating and improving the long term resilience of lakes under anthropogenic droughts according to previous studies different methods have evaluated resilience of water resources systems however the seven principles of resilience have not been used for assessing the resilience of large scale groundwater resources the main purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for integrated groundwater resources management based on stakeholder and resilience analysis we develop a system dynamics based simulation model for evaluating the physical economic and environmental aspects of some proposed groundwater management scenarios then for considering the social aspect the rough set theory is used to classify stakeholders according to their powers and interests also a groundwater model is developed in order to simulate aquifer and calculate aquifer response functions finally the results of the stakeholder analysis and system dynamics model are used in a proposed social choice framework to rank groundwater management scenarios based on some hydrologic economic and resilience based criteria the rest of this paper is organized as follows first the proposed methodology is presented and discussed in detail then a brief description of the study area is given and finally the main findings for the application of the methodology to the case study are presented and discussed 2 methodology a flowchart of the methodology is presented in fig 1 in the following sections different parts of the proposed flowchart are discussed 2 1 data and information collection the first step in data collection is identifying the study area s location and its geographic boundaries in order to have a more precise evaluation we divided the study area into some sub areas furthermore we collected the required data for system dynamics modeling i e hydrological and economic characteristics of the study such as rainfall runoff water consumption in each sector and crops production functions and groundwater modeling e g groundwater table porosity piezometric data and exploitation wells data also a questionnaire was designed for conducting interviews with experts and individuals who hold a major stake in the study area in order to identify stakeholders and determine their attributes the designed questionnaire is presented in the online supplementary material 2 2 stakeholder analysis the first step in stakeholder analysis is identifying the main actors and their roles snowball sampling goodman 1961 was used to identify the stakeholders that affect the condition of the system in this paper since stakeholders cannot be classified with complete certainty we used the rough set theory to classify stakeholders the rough set theory which was introduced by zdzistaw 1982 is a mathematical tool to deal with imprecise inconsistent and incomplete information and knowledge in rough set theory two precise boundary lines are considered to describe uncertain and imprecise concepts the rough set theory based model classifies stakeholders through the following phases abed elmdoust and kerachian 2012 abraham et al 2009 1 preprocessing phase a decision table was constructed in this phase in the rough set theory every object is expressed by means of some attributes decision table rows refer to observations called objects and its columns refer to objects attributes provided by experts therefore each cell of the table indicates a description of the object placed in that row by means of the attribute in the related column in other words the decision table divided objects into decision classes according to their attributes a sample of the decision table is shown in table 1 2 attribute reduction and rule generation in this phase redundant attributes are eliminated and main attributes i e a minimal set of attributes discerning one object from others are used for generating decision rules decision rules are logical statements that show the relation between conditional attributes and decision making attributes for example from table 1 we gain the following rules if for a stakeholder annual budget is high access to information is high legal backing is medium and scientific backing is medium then the stakeholder s power is high if for a stakeholder annual budget is high access to information is medium legal backing is low and scientific backing is high then the stakeholder s power is medium 3 probabilistic classification in this phase stakeholders are classified probabilistically in order to determine their decision classes naïve bayes and standard vote are the common methods for classification in the rough set theory olson and delen 2008 in the standard vote method objects are classified by first identifying rules with a matching if part and then by letting these rules cast votes to the decision classes in the corresponding then parts the ratio between the number of votes cast by each decision class and the number of total votes indicates the degree to which objects belong to decision classes naive bayes is a supervised learning algorithm for the classification based on bayes theorem which says 1 p c k p k c p c p k p c k probability of instance k being in class c posterior probability p k c probability of generating instance k given class c likelihood p c probability of occurrence of class c class prior probability p k probability of instance k occurring predictor class probability naive bayes classifier assumes that attributes have independent distribution i e the effect of a particular attribute in a class is independent of other attributes 2 p c k p c 1 k p c 2 k p c n k 3 p c j k p c j n 1 m p c n k p k where m denotes the total number of attributes 2 3 groundwater numerical modeling in this paper we used a three dimensional groundwater model for groundwater simulations the model was created using modflow harbaugh 2005 and the simulations were carried out using groundwater modeling system gms due to changes in pumping rates of wells and impacts of overlapping cones of depression of wells on the groundwater level the spatial location of the point with the highest groundwater table drawdown will change therefore we should calculate an aquifer response function to determine the relationship between the average and maximum groundwater table drawdown the required data for developing the relation between average and maximum groundwater table drawdown was obtained by running the numeral simulation model with different pumping rates many times to evaluate the impact of water management scenarios on sub areas the spatial resolution of the conceptual model should be increased one of the most important elements of the model is the groundwater exchange between sub areas i e inflow from other sub areas and outflow to other sub areas which can be obtained from the regional water budget in the modflow model 2 4 system dynamics modeling system dynamics sd modeling is a conceptual and numerical method that is usually used to understand the structure and behavior of complex systems system dynamics approach not only considers model feedbacks delays and non linear effects but also helps to improve system understanding and system thinking skills kelly et al 2013 stocks and flows are fundamental to the dynamics of complex systems sterman 2000 in system dynamics stocks are accumulations and they characterize the state of the system and create the information upon which decisions and actions are made stocks create delays by accumulating the difference between the inflow to a process and its outflow flow variables are rates which can change stock variables in this paper the system dynamics model consists of two sub systems i e hydrological and environmental sub system and economic sub system which are discussed in the following section 2 4 1 hydrologic and environmental sub system fig 2 presents the stock and flow diagrams of the hydrologic and environmental sub system available water is stock in this sub model and is increased by the total incoming surface and groundwater and decreased by agricultural industrial and municipal water consumptions as well as outgoing flow the total incoming surface water is the sum of runoff total transferred water and surface water inflow from other basins the total incoming groundwater is the sum of infiltration groundwater inflow from other basins and return groundwater flows from water consumptions land subsidence due to groundwater table drawdown can cause many problems such as damages to buildings and infrastructures the land subsidence is calculated as 4 s u z p i 2 p i 1 e where z is aquifer thickness e is the modulus of elasticity of the soil pi1 and pi2 are the granular pressures before and after the drawdown of the groundwater table delleur 1999 2 4 2 economic sub system fig 3 presents the stock and flow diagrams of the economic sub system value added is a stock in this sub model which is increased by the added value from agricultural and industrial sectors and decreased by operational e g pumping cost and maintenance costs pumping cost can be calculated as 5 cos t pumping q h h r 367 η p p where q is the flow rate of pumps m3 year h is head of the pump m hr is pumping operating hours hr year η is pump efficiency and p is the electricity price toman in this sub system we used fisher equation to calculate the real interest rate based on nominal interest rate and inflation rate 6 1 r 1 i 1 π where r is the real interest rate i is the inflation rate and π is the nominal interest rate 2 5 evaluating the resilience of scenarios resilience is the capacity of the system to respond and adapt to anticipated as well as unexpected changes and disturbances walker and salt 2012 there are seven generic principles for enhancing the resilience of the ecosystem services p1 maintain diversity and redundancy p2 manage connectivity p3 manage slow variables and feedbacks p4 foster an understanding of social ecological systems as complex adaptive systems cas p5 encourage learning and experimentation p6 broaden participation and p7 promote polycentric governance systems biggs et al 2012 therefore the resilience of water resources management scenarios can be evaluated by assessing these principles resilience principles are described in table 2 the first step to evaluate the resilience of a scenario was defining and quantifying performance criteria for each principle then the analytical evidential reasoning approach which can tackle multi criteria decision making problems with both quantitative and qualitative criteria under uncertainty motlaghzadeh et al 2020 was used to estimate the total resilience of management scenarios based on the seven resilience principles 2 6 social choice procedure we used social choice procedures in order to aggregate the preferences and interests of decision makers and make a collective and fair decision mahjouri and pourmand 2017 khorasani et al 2018 the first step to rank the scenarios is determining stakeholder s utility functions stakeholders were interviewed to determine the importance of each decision criteria from the stakeholder s perspective then we used the system dynamics based simulation model and the evidential reasoning based approach to estimate the value of each criterion for scenarios hence the total score given to ith scenario by kth stakeholder is calculated as follow 7 s k a i j 1 m u kj d j where uij denotes the importance of jth decision criterion from the viewpoint of kth stakeholder dj is the normalized value of jth decision criterion in the next step we proposed and used the electoral college voting approach to rank the scenarios 2 6 1 electoral college voting approach after assigning scores to scenarios by stakeholders each stakeholder votes for a scenario that obtains more scores from his point of view a stakeholder s number of electoral votes equals the stakeholder s power which is calculated using the rough set theory the possibility of the stakeholders participation in the voting process depends on their interests in other words stakeholders with low interest may not run into the process of ranking scenarios as the rough set theory based model provides the probability density functions for the power and interests of stakeholders stochastic values are assigned to the stakeholder s powers and interests by sampling from the probability density functions and the best scenario is chosen using the social choice method by repeating this process many times and changing stakeholder s power and interest values the winning probability of each scenario is calculated by dividing the number of times it was selected as the winner to the total number of iterations the scenario with the highest probability is considered to be the optimal solution for managing groundwater resources using the electoral college voting approach stakeholders preferences are aggregated and stakeholder analysis results are incorporated in the decision making procedure 3 case study to evaluate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed stakeholder based framework for groundwater resource management the rafsanjan plain in the southeast part of iran was selected this plain is located in 54 52 to 56 34 e and 29 51 to 30 31 n with an area of 12 421 km2 fig 4 table 3 presents a brief overview of the study area the climate of rafsanjan plain is characterized as arid subtropical with 90 mm mean annual rainfall and over 3 000 mm potential evapotranspiration the average annual temperature in rafsanjan is 17 6 c and it has dry winters with an average temperature of 6 c and hot summers with an average temperature of 29 c sayyaf et al 2014 groundwater is the primary source of water supply in rafsanjan plain the annual groundwater discharge in this plain is about 750 million cubic meters and this region currently suffers from an approximately 150 million cubic meters deficit in the groundwater balance as a result of high agricultural and industrial water consumption overexploitation of groundwater resources has caused average and maximum land subsidence of 5 cm year and 20 cm year during the past decade motagh et al 2017 pistachio is the rafsanjan s biggest agricultural commodity which is a perennial crop with a long establishment period and high irrigation demand the establishment time for pistachio tree is about seven years more than 3000 cubic meters of water is required for irrigating one hectare of pistachio trees per year the main characteristics of sub areas which were determined considering the villages boundaries are presented in table 4 4 results 4 1 stakeholder analysis for the identification of main stakeholders which are related to water supply and demand in the study area we interviewed several experts also we used the snowball sampling goodman 1961 to ensure that all stakeholders were identified table 5 presents a list of stakeholders and their main tasks related to groundwater resource management in this study area according to the results of interviews and experts opinions access to information annual budget legal backing and scientific backing are the conditional attributes to describe power as a decision attribute furthermore influence and social responsibility were identified as conditional attributes to characterized stakeholders level of interest some of the rules generated using the rough set theory are presented in table 6 in this paper naive bayes algorithm which requires less training data to estimate classification parameters was applied to classify the stakeholders probabilistically tables 7 and 8 show the probability distribution of the main stakeholders power and interest according to table 7 it can be inferred that rafsanjan regional water company and ministry of agriculture are the most powerful stakeholders in the study area therefore these organizations have more electoral votes than others also according to table 8 rafsanjan regional water company and ministry of agriculture are more likely to participate in the process of ranking scenarios 4 2 groundwater numerical modeling in this paper the rafsanjan aquifer was simulated using the gms model fig 5 the dimension of the aquifer was 27km 20km the continuous domain was replaced by a discretized domain with 250 m 250 m cells therefore the model grid consists of 80 rows and 108 columns the boundary conditions of the aquifer were classified as impermeable or permeable with a specific flow rate fig 5c the groundwater model was calibrated and validated based on head measurements in 96 observation wells from 2006 to 2019 160 stress periods each representing one month 75 of these data were used for the calibration and 25 of them were used for the verification of the groundwater simulation model by comparing observed and simulated hydraulic head values root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute residual error mare in the verification process were calculated as 0 83 and 1 53 m respectively fig 6 the aquifer response function was calculated to determine the relationship between average and maximum groundwater table drawdown a linear regression relation between these two parameters is as follows 8 δ h critical 3 43 δ h average 3 24 r 2 0 975 n s e 0 975 response functions of sub areas and their coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are available in table s2 of the online supplementary material 4 3 system dynamics modeling in this paper system dynamics modeling was employed to simulate water management scenarios developed for the rafsanjan plain the model was run for 20 years with an annual time step to examine the effectiveness of these water management scenarios water management scenarios have been designed in previous studies bagheri and babaeian 2020 management and planning organization of iran 2016 a brief description of each scenario is presented in table 9 the performance of the system dynamics model was evaluated by comparing the average groundwater table calculated using the system dynamics model and the calibrated modflow model fig 7 by comparing the results of sd and modflow models the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient were calculated as 0 98 and 0 96 respectively values of decision criteria which are used in the social choice procedure are estimated using the system dynamics based model variation of the volume of groundwater resources maximum groundwater table drawdown land subsidence initial investment total added value and total employment are the main decision criteria of stakeholders to evaluate the water management scenarios the results of evaluating each scenario are presented in table 10 the corresponding results for sub areas are provided in table s3 s8 of online supplementary material it can be concluded from table 10 that only by using modern irrigation systems and reducing water demands the aquifer can be recovered moreover keeping the current management policies i e the status quo scenario has detrimental effects on the plain also table 10 shows that increasing the area of greenhouses can increase the total value added by 40 4 4 resilience evaluation in this section we estimated the resilience of each water resources management scenario based on the seven generic resilience principles at first different criteria and sub criteria for evaluating each principle were defined table 11 then we employed an analytical evidential reasoning based approach to estimate the total resilience of each scenario table 12 presents the calculated values for the total resilience of the scenarios the corresponding results for sub areas are provided in table s9 s14 in the online supplementary material resilience of each management scenario will be used in the social choice procedure as a decision making criterion 4 5 social choice in this section we rank water management scenarios which were defined in table 9 based on the result of system dynamics modeling stakeholder analysis and their resilience first we calculated the stakeholders utilities for each scenario using eq 7 after assigning scores to the scenarios by each stakeholder they have voted for the scenario which gains more scores from their point of view table 13 presents the total score of each scenario from the view point of stakeholders scores of the management scenario for sub areas are available in tables s15 s20 of online supplementary material note that the number of votes of each stakeholder is equal to its power and possibility of stakeholders voting depends on their interests which is obtained from stakeholder analysis next we used the monte carlo simulation to incorporate the existing uncertainties in stakeholders powers and interests the procedure of ranking scenarios is repeated 1000 times the ranking of the scenarios is presented in table 14 considering the adverse environmental impacts of inter basin water transfer projects khadem et al 2021 zhuang 2016 ranking of the scenarios without incorporating the water transfer project is also presented table 15 ranking of scenarios for sub areas are available in tables s21 s25 in the online supplementary material the results indicate that modern irrigation systems and inter basin water transfer are the best scenario for managing groundwater resources in the rafsanjan plain by considering stakeholders power interest and utility furthermore establishing local water market can be considered as an auxiliary strategy to improve other strategies due to its low initial costs 5 summary and conclusion in this paper we proposed a stakeholder based framework for improving the resilience of groundwater resources in arid regions we used the rough set theory to analyze stakeholders and determine their powers and interests the study area was simulated using the gms model furthermore we developed a system dynamics based simulation model to simulate the proposed groundwater management scenarios and obtain the values of decision making criteria including several criteria based on the seven resilience principles to estimate the total resilience criterion the evidential reasoning approach was applied finally we employed the proposed electoral college voting approach to rank the groundwater management scenarios we applied the developed framework to the rafsnjan plain in iran which is suffering from some water and environmental issues such as severe groundwater table drawdown and land subsidence results showed that using modern irrigation system and inter basin water transfer is the socially optimal and the most preferred scenario for managing groundwater in the study area however the ranking of the other scenarios are different in sub areas also it can be inferred that establishing local water market due to its low initial cost should be taken into account as a supplementary strategy that can be implemented with other water managing scenarios in future

3387,high accurate streamflow data obtained from the fluvial acoustic tomography fat increase forecasting accuracy especially in the case of short term forecasting the reason is due to the better temporal resolution and higher measurement frequency than the traditional rating curve rc method in this study multilayer gmdh algorithm mga and combinatorial gmdh algorithm cga were used to forecast the short term streamflow these models as well as their combinations with the discrete wavelet transform dwt were applied to the 6 month streamflow datasets obtained from the fat and rc method and the hourly forecasts of streamflow were done with 1 to 48 h ahead lead times the results showed that the mga model has a better performance than the cga model it was also observed that combining of the mga model with dwt increased the forecasting accuracy however based on the concept of occam s razor and due to the insignificant difference between mga and dwt mga models the simpler one i e mga was chosen as the optimal model the comparison of forecasting results using the fat and rc revealed that in the case of applying fat dataset the nash sutcliffe nse rate ranged from 0 99 to 0 73 for 1 hour ahead to 48 hour ahead forecasts whereas it adversely changed from 0 98 to 0 06 for the rc dataset this study demonstrates the capability of fat data in providing reliable and accurate hourly streamflow forecasting keywords group method of data handling algorithm gmdh hourly forecasting hydroacoustic 1 introduction hydrological models of streamflow forecasting are generally divided into two main categories physical and data driven decision making models the latter is more welcomed by researchers due to the less complicated relationship between environmental variables and streamflow abbasi et al 2021 tiwari and chatterjee 2010 combined the discrete wavelet transform model with the biologically annotated neural networks bann and multilayer perceptron mlp to forecast the 1 to 10 h ahead lead times streamflow of the mahanadi river in india using rating curve rc data their findings revealed that the wbann hybrid model outperformed the bann and mlp models in short term hourly forecasting alexander et al 2018 combinedthe wavelet transform signal processing modelwith the artificial neural network ann forecasting model to provide short term flood stage forecasting of the achankovil river in the indian state of kerala for 1 3 and 6 h ahead lead times the results revealed that the wavelet transform artificial neural network wtann hybrid model was more accurate than the ann model in hourly forecasting walton et al 2019 used twoclassical group method of data handling models gmdh the combinatorial gmdh algorithm cga model and the multilayer gmdh algorithm mga to forecast a 2 year flood peak in the united states in addition the authors introduced a novel model called the generalized structure of gmdh algorithm gsga the analysis of these three approaches indicated that the gsga could overcome the drawbacks of utilizing classicalmodels independently and provide more accurate forecasting aghelpour and varshavian 2020 used daily rating curve data of a hydrometric station in the zeliki river in northern iran to forecast the daily streamflow they employed two statistical models of autoregressive moving average arma and autoregressive integrated moving average arima along with three artificial intelligence ai models the classification data algorithm the multilayer perceptron algorithm mlp and the grnn the results showed that two models of the multilayer perceptron algorithm and the gmdh were more accurate in forecasting the daily streamflow kabir et al 2020 used river streamflow and meteorological data as input signals to three forecasting models of support vector regression svr deep belief network dbn and wann a hybrid of wavelet transform and ann to forecast hourly streamflow according to the results the svr approach has higher accuracy for 1 to 2 h ahead lead times forecasts than other methods but its accuracy gradually decreases as the forecast time step increases to 3 h ahead lead times and above elkurdy et al 2021 forecasted the hourly streamflow of the bow river in alberta canada using the gsga flow data from the previous nine years were used as an input to the model the results showed that the gsga model had an excellent performance to forecast up to 17 h ahead lead times wang et al 2021 used gmdh chi square automatic interaction detector chaid random forest rf and hybrid of these models with intrinsic time scale decomposition itd to forecast streamflow of the varahi river basin in the western ghats of karnataka india one three and seven days ahead the results illustrated that the hybrid models had a better performance at all lead times the fluvial acoustic tomography fat is a cutting edge hydroacoustic technology designed to continuously monitor streamflow with high accuracy time resolution two fat stations each connected to a transducer immersed in water are placed diagonally on both sides of the river fig 1 the flow velocity and streamflow data are acquired by transmitting sound waves simultaneously from these stationsusing the time of travel method bahreinimotlagh et al 2019 al sawaf et al 2017 showed that the streamflow measured by the fat is more accurate than it obtained from the rc method kawanisi et al 2018 applied the fat to measure the flow characteristics of the gono river in japan for 127 days they compared the fat data with the rc method the findings revealed that fat has higher temporal resolution and better accuracy than rc for recording high frequency oscillations of streamflow time series al sawaf and kawanisi 2019 compared the fat and rc data to measure the streamflow during a flood event the results showed that the fat had a highercapability to measure flood characteristics than the rc method al sawaf and kawanisi 2020 used fat and rc data to characterize streamflow patterns using information and complexity metrics the results showed that only the fat can capture the high frequency components of the streamflow regime al sawaf et al 2021 forecasted the flood streamflowrate of the gono river in hiroshima province japan using hydrological and meteorological data as an input to the recurrent neural network rnn model they used the flow streamflow measured by the fat system as a reference flow to evaluate the outcomes of their forecasting due to its high temporal resolution the results revealed that the rnn model cannot extrapolate to forecast floods outside of the network s training range the fat is widely applied in different rivers in china bahreini motlagh et al 2015 canada razaz et al 2016 iran bahreinimotlagh et al 2019 japan hasanabadi et al 2022 etc in all cases the comparison between fat data and the data obtained from the rc method demonstrated the higher accuracy of the former one in previous studies rc data have been used as input models to forecast the streamflow while the novelty of this research is applying the fat data as models input to demonstrate the capability of fat data on improving the short term streamflow forecasting accuracy for this purpose forecast models were fed six months of consecutive streamflow data from the gono river located in hiroshima prefecture japan the following forecast models were used multilayer gmdh algorithm mga combinatorial gmdh algorithm cga and their hybrid form with discrete wavelet transform dwt fig 2 two paths are defined for forecasting i in the first path there are time delays on the input data then this data enters forecasting networks cga and mga directly without any signal processing ii in the second path the past flow data is entered into the discrete wavelet transform and then the extracted features are entered as time series into the forecasting network in this step a time delay is considered on each time series the forecasting is made by the cga or mga model these hybrid models are called dwt cga and dwt mga 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study and data type the fat acquired gono river streamflow data over six months with a time resolution of 30 s which was reduced to 10 min by applying 20 data moving average the miyoshi city is located near to the observation site with an average temperature ranging from 8 5 to 19 4 c the average rainfall is 1492 mm year the gono river is 194 km long and consists of two main tributaries the saijo and the basen bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 the bed of this river has a gravel and boulder structure the gono river catchment area is 3900 km2 the width of this river is 115 m and the slope of the bed in the interval between the stations is 0 11 the average annual river flow at ozekiyama gauging station located about 1 1 km upstream of the fat stations is approximately 73 m3 s the rc data were collected with a time interval of 1 h from the ozekiyama gauging station by the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit japan fig 3 two types of databases have been developed as input to forecast models and discrete wavelet transform the fat method is used to prepare the first database while the rc method is used to prepare the second database according to the chart presented in fig 2 there are four different modes for short term hourly forecasting on both types of databases in the first step without signal processing on the input data short term hourly forecasting is performed by the gmdh algorithms in the next step first by discrete wavelet transform feature extraction is performed on the input data signal and then forecasting is done by gmdh methods finally the performance of the forecasts is evaluated using statistical criteria there are no tributaries or municipal sewers between fat and ozekiyama gauging stations 2 2 group method of data handling the group method of data handling gmdh is a model used in various branches of science najafzadeh et al 2018 this method was first proposed by ivakhnenko 1968 to solve high order polynomial equations gmdh can overcome the complexity of the equation and linear dependence in standard regression equations the gmdh algorithm is called a heuristic method because it can model complex systems of regression type with high degrees ivakhnenko and ivakhnenko 1995 the gmdh model consists of two classical algorithms i combinatorial gmdh algorithm cga ii multilayer gmdh algorithm mga 2 2 1 combinatorial gmdh algorithm cga the cga model is a simple model of the gmdh algorithm to avoid over fitting the forecast model the arrangement of observational data is randomly shuffled among these shuffled data 70 of the data are selected as training data and the remaining 30 as testing data then according to the k fold cross validation criteria the training data set is randomly divided into k sub samples with the same volume in each sub sample the k 1 number of the sub samples is considered as training data and one of the sub samples is considered as the validation data set in this research k is considered to be 4 which has been selected by examining different scenarios and selecting the best one with the shortest running time the input data matrix contains n observational data related to the m parameter observational data are divided into two groups training data na and testing data nb the training data is used to generate the optimal model the optimal model is constructed by minimizing the following fitness function 1 ar b 1 n b i 1 n b y i y i b 2 m i n where y i is the output per stage and y i b is the data related to evaluation a new input variable is applied to each stage and is controlled using the fitness function to increase accuracy if no improvement in the algorithm s performance is observed after adding new variables the model is stopped the first stage whose input variables in the next stages are also fixed members is defined as follows 2 y a 0 a 1 x i i 1 2 m in the next stages new variables are added to the polynomial which makes the model more complex the coefficients in these equations for each stage are obtained by the least squares method the general state of the equations in stage m is defined as follows 3 y a 0 a 1 x i a 2 x j a m x l i j l 1 2 m where a 0 a 1 a 2 a m are weight coefficients and x i x j x l are the input data in each stage cga algorithm includes six steps as follows fig 4 step 1 input data is divided into two parts training data and testing data step 2 different stage are formed to describe the complexity of the models step 3 the polynomial structure of the models is created and the coefficients of all sentences are calculated step 4 the optimal model is selected in each stage step 5 an additional model is created step 6 an additional model is made for the next stage and steps 2 to 5 are repeated if the model is improved according to the ar criterion the next stages are made again and steps 2 to 5 are completed otherwise the loop ends searching for the optimal model 2 2 2 multilayer gmdh algorithm mga the mga model is one of the classical algorithms of the gmdh model this model proceeds without going back to the previous layers and doing the calculations again it performs layer by layer calculations for each layer and selects the input of the next layer so that it finds a logical relationship between the input data and the target data this model shows an excellent ability to solve nonlinear equations shaikh et al 2019 input data is initially divided into two parts training data and target data the network training process is powered by training data which is classified into two parts internal training data and testing data in the mge model polynomials are formed to solve the problem consisting of two variables thus by pairs of variables connected a set of polynomials is created called a layer fig 5 the input layer contains the input variables in this study the past flow measurements are used valterra series polynomial known as the kolmogorov gabor polynomial can be used to define the relationship between input and output variables this polynomial is expressed by eq 4 samsudin et al 2011 4 y a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j 1 n a ij x i x j i 1 n j 1 n k 1 n a ij x i x j x k where x is the input variable a is the weight coefficient n is the number of input parameters and y is the output of each layer since each polynomial is made up of only two input variables eq 5 is shown as a quadratic equation as follows 5 y z ij a 0 a i x i a j x j a ij x i x j a ii x i 2 a jj x j 2 in each layer to calculate the output six weight factors must be calculated each layer consists of input data pairs x i x j i j 1 2 n for which there is also a corresponding output z ij i j 1 2 n in other words an equation system with n equations containing six unknown parameters must be solved the least squares method can be used to obtain coefficients of a walton et al 2019 the forecasting steps of the mga algorithm are as follows farlow 1984 step 1 the input data is divided into two parts training data and testing data step 2 a new variable is created using c m 2 m m 1 2 for the training data set then by constructing quadratic polynomials of eq 5 for the first layer weight coefficients are obtained by the least squares method step 3 the output of the nodes with less rmse is substituted for the input data column x and new variables zij are created for the next layers step 4 steps 2 and 3 are repeated and this process is established until one of the following two conditions is met i the rmse of the test data in each layer stops decreasing ii the network reaches its maximum number of defined layers 2 3 discrete wavelet transform wavelet transform is one of the main signal processing tools that decomposes the signal into two domains of time and frequency liu et al 2014 wavelet transform extracts some signal information which is considered as hidden features of the signal these features cannot be extracted from the original signal without signal processing there is a concept in the wavelet transform process called tree decomposition ergen 2012 one of the main purposes of using wavelet transform is to decompose the signal in several steps by using wavelets as high pass and low pass filters during this process after the feature extracting by the wavelets in the first level the signal is divided into a low frequency component or base signal a and a high frequency component or details ds adamowski and chan 2011 it is necessary to explain the performance of the wavelet transform the input signal in this study past flow enters the wavelet transform model as input and it is decomposed in the first level of decomposition into an approximate a and detail ds in the next level the approximate is also decomposed to a new approximate and detail the last approximate and other details can reconstruct the signal fig 6 fig 7 shows discrete wavelet transform hybrid models and cga and mga algorithms in this research after trial and error the haar wavelet transform with two decomposition levels is selected as the optimal model of the discrete wavelet transform in the dwt gmbh hybrid model after decomposition of the input data the approximate a and the details d1 and d2 are entered as input into the gmdh model that is why in fig 7 each of the a d1 and d2 is passed into the mga and cga models in other words the forecast is made on three time series finally the forecasting results of each of them are aggregated together and the forecasted streamflow is obtained for the two databases of fat and rc a short term hourly forecast has been done for 1 6 12 and 24 hour lead times 2 4 performance evaluation criteria to assess the efficacy of the forecasting models employed in this study pearson s correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute relative error mare are used as follows 6 r l 1 n o l o p l p l 1 n o l o 2 l 1 n p l p 2 7 mae 1 n l 1 n o l p l 8 rmse l 1 n o l p l 2 n 9 mare 1 n l 1 n o l p l o l where o l and p l are the observed streamflow and forecasted streamflow values respectively o and p are observed streamflow mean value and forecasted streamflow mean value respectively also n is the total number of input data points mae and rmse parameters show the accuracy of fitting and deviation between the observed data and the forecasted values the rmse index shows the normal distribution of the forecasted error and is not suitable for all forecasting models rmse is more appropriate than the mae for normal error distribution chai and draxler 2014 the mae index is used to calculate the absolute value of the difference between the observed and forecasted values yaseen et al 2017 mare indicates the relative error between the forecasted and observed values it is a measure of the average performance of the model which shows the distribution of the forecast error zero mare shows the best performance and an increase in its value indicates a decrease in model accuracy wieprecht et al 2013 the r index is also a value between 1 and 1 that indicates the covariance of the forecasted data this criterion shows the correlation between the two variables when r is 1 it means a positive correlation when it is 0 it means no correlation and 1 means negative correlation sedgwick 2012 furthermore to evaluate the models and identify the optimal model the nash sutcliffe coefficient has been used which is as follows 10 nse 1 i 1 n q o i q f i 2 i 1 n q o i q o i n s e 1 where q o i q f i and q o i are the observed streamflow forecasted streamflow and the observed streamflow mean values respectively the closer the nash sutcliffe criterion to 1 the better the model s performance nash and sutcliffe 1970 nash sutcliffe is a statistical measure of a model s ability to forecast flows that differ from the mean the range of variations of this coefficient is from 1 to 1 for the best fit and for the worst case dawson and wilby 2001 a nash value above 0 9 indicates the good performance of the model it indicates relatively acceptable performance when it is between 0 9 and 0 8 and poor performance when it is below 0 8 shamseldin 1997 3 results and discussion the short term forecasting is made for 1 2 6 12 18 24 and 48 hour lead times to investigate the effect of input database type on the accuracy of the forecasts all the mentioned processes are performed for two databases of fat and rc to extract the signal features haar wavelet daubechies wavelet 2 to 4 and meyer wavelet 1 to 3 are used for both cga and mga models the results for three decomposition levels l2 l3 l4 for one hour ahead forecast are presented in table a1 for all decomposition levels and different wavelets the lowest rmse is related to haar wavelet and decomposition level 2 therefore the extraction of streamflow signal properties for dwt mga and dwt cga hybrid models has been performed using haar wavelet and decomposition level 2 as illustrated in fig 8 the fat and the rc data are decomposed by discrete wavelet transform into low frequency a and high frequency d components a d and c show the d1 d2 and a components of fat data respectively d e and f show the d1 d2 and a components of rc data respectively table 1 indicates the statistical evaluation of short term forecasting the results show that all classical and hybrid forecasting models presented for short term forecasting performed on fat data are generally more accurate than rc data the reason is that the fat data were taken with higher accuracy and temporal resolution than the rc data which has been previously demonstrated al sawaf and kawanisi 2019 bahreinimotlagh et al 2019 kawanisi et al 2016 as a result using fat data has led to more accurate results for the forecast algorithm the accuracy results of the forecasts made on both types of input databases by all forecasting models show that the highest accuracy belongs to a 1 hour ahead forecast the results show that by increasing the time step of the forecast its accuracy is reduced the cga model is a simple model of gmdh but the mga model is more complex than the cga according to the values presented in table 1 the mga model shows a better performance than the cga comparing all statistical criteria between these two models for lead times of 1 to 48 h confirms this the mga also performs better than cga for the 6 12 and 24 h lead times for forecasting on the rc database however for the 1 h ahead forecast on rc data the cga and mga models have produced almost the same results according to the nash sutcliffe and mare criteria the mga model yielded accuracy values of 0 98 and 0 02 respectively according to the rmse and mae criteria with 4 12 and 1 55 values respectively the cga model was slightly more accurate than the mga model according to the comparison made for the forecasts of the two classic gmdh models for both the rc input database and the fat it can be concluded that the mga model performs better than the cga model the results of combining dwt and gmdh forecasting models showed that the dwt mga model is a successful model in short term forecasting as presented in table 1 forecasting on fat data with 6 12 18 24 and 48 hour lead time and rc data with 1 hour lead time have increased the forecast accuracy compared to the mga model even in cases that do not show an increase in the accuracy of the mga model the difference from the results of the mga model is negligible for example the comparison of rmse values between the 24 hour forecasts made for the fat and rc databases are equal to 42 05 and 42 98 respectively thus this slight difference can be ignored the performance of hybrid models for fat data is also better than those of rc because the fat captures more details of the fluctuation than the rc method based on the occam s razor theory between two models with similar results the simpler model is the optimal model blumer et al 1987 sorkin 1983 due to the fact that the difference between the two models of mga and dwt mga is negligible it is better to accept the simpler model i e mga as the optimal one the hybrid cga and dwt models reduced the accuracy of short term hourly forecasts compared to other models this reduction in accuracy has been observed for both fat and rc databases the cga model is a simpler model than the mga model and is a single layer gmdh model wavelet transform by extracting input signal features provides more details to the forecasts model which further complicates the model the cga model as a simpler model than the mga model has not been able to find the mathematical relationship between these details for better forecasting the dwt cga hybrid model has less accuracy than the other models presented in this research as mentioned in subsection 2 2 the mge model s structure is multi layered so the layers structure of this model is important fig 9 shows the network structure of the layers in mga for the best result i e a one hour lead time the model achieved the best fit in this case by forming three layers the last layer polynomial of the mga and dwt mga models as well as the best polynomial of the cga and dwt cga models are shown in table a2 and table a3 respectively for the fat and rc databases fig 10 shows the scattering diagrams for the mga model selected as the optimal model among all the proposed models for 1 6 and 24 hour ahead lead times in this case study according to these diagrams the best fit belongs to 1 hour forecasts on fat data typically as the lead times increase the accuracy of the forecasting decreases and consequently the scatter of the data increases in all forecast modes these diagrams for the forecasting made on the fat data show less scatter than those made on the rc data in other words the correlations between the forecasting and the observational streamflow for fat data are more significant than those for the rc data this correlation decreases with increasing lead time for example the 48 hour ahead forecast has the lowest correlation the streamflow is also divided into high and low periods the streamflow with an observational value of more than 200 m3 s is defined as a high period and less than 200 m3 s as low period statistical analysis for each period reveals that scattering degree is very small in the low streamflow period and for most lead times model performance is more precise in the low streamflow period also for 6 h to 48 h lead times the accuracy of the models decreases more for high streamflow periods than low streamflow periods fig a1e n fig 11 and fig a2 compares the observed and the forecasted streamflows by the mga model on the fat and rc data as explained earlier these forecastings were more accurate for fat data than for rc data on 30 01 2016 the most significant flood with a magnitude of 424 m3 s for fat and 440 m3 s for rc occurred but there was no flood with this magnitude in the observation period this flood peak is forecasted by the mga algorithm for lead times of 1 to 6 h with acceptable accuracy for both databases the forecasted values for the lead time of 6 h ahead on the fat and rc data are 403 and 421 m3 s respectively fig 11e and f however the forecasts for 24 and 48 h ahead for both databases are less accurate and the forecasted flow rate is less than the observed flow rate for example the forecasted streamflow value for a 24 h ahead for the fat and rc databases are 279 m3 s and 229 m3 s respectively fig 11e and f due to the new flood characteristics the mga algorithm cannot forecast this flood well for 12 to 48 h ahead of lead times for two consecutive days on 26 03 2016 and 25 03 2016 the upstream dams haji and haizuka flushed as a result two successive peaks are seen in fig 11 for these two days this flood does not have a natural pattern and does not follow the hydrological trend of the river given that the rc data has less information than fat data on the momentary changes of the flood streamflow for 6 to 48 hour ahead lead times the streamflow at these two artificial flood peaks is not well forecasted by the mga algorithm for rc data however these two peaks were well forecasted for fat data even for a 24 hour ahead fig 11c to d this can be related to the high temporal resolution of the fat system as it captures more details of streamflow fluctuations to determine the role of fat data in increasing the accuracy of forecasting with the mga model which was selected as the optimal model forecasting on fat data with one hour time step performed for 1 2 6 12 18 24 and 48 hour lead times and the results were compared with the forecasting made on the rc data results according to table 2 the forecasting accuracy in these conditions for time intervals of 1 2 and 6 h is almost the same for both rc and fat data types however with increasing the time step of forecasting 12 18 24 and 48 hour lead time forecasting accuracy for fat data becomes more than rc data as illustrated in fig 12 fat technology allows researchers to capture data with higher time resolution and higher accuracy therefore in addition to high temporal resolution of fat data the nature of this data can also increase the accuracy of forecasting 4 conclusion in this study we demonstrated the better performance of fat data on the accuracy of short term forecasting compared with the traditional rc data the dwt mga hybrid model showed that discrete wavelet transforms in four lead times 1 h rc 6 h fat 12 h fat and 24 h fat increased the accuracy of the forecasts however due to the slight difference between the two models mga and dwt mga based on the concept of the occam s razor the simpler model i e mga was selected as the optimal model in this study among the forecasting models the highest accuracy has always been related to the forecasting made on the fat data this is one of the reasons why fat technology is effective in short term forecasting accuracy for example the nash sutcliffe and rmse values for the 12 h ahead forecasting for the mga model on fat data is 0 96 and 8 463 m3 s respectively whereas these values reach 0 65 and 29 445 m3 s respectively for 12 h ahead forecasting on rc data as a result one of the factors affecting the forecasting accuracy performed by data driven models is the accuracy of the input database to these models fat as one of the hydroacoustic instruments for data collection with high accuracy and temporal resolution compared to traditional methods such as the rc method can increase the accuracy of forecasting credit authorship contribution statement yousef olfatmiri methodology masoud bahreinimotlagh writing original draft supervision ebrahim jabbari

3387,high accurate streamflow data obtained from the fluvial acoustic tomography fat increase forecasting accuracy especially in the case of short term forecasting the reason is due to the better temporal resolution and higher measurement frequency than the traditional rating curve rc method in this study multilayer gmdh algorithm mga and combinatorial gmdh algorithm cga were used to forecast the short term streamflow these models as well as their combinations with the discrete wavelet transform dwt were applied to the 6 month streamflow datasets obtained from the fat and rc method and the hourly forecasts of streamflow were done with 1 to 48 h ahead lead times the results showed that the mga model has a better performance than the cga model it was also observed that combining of the mga model with dwt increased the forecasting accuracy however based on the concept of occam s razor and due to the insignificant difference between mga and dwt mga models the simpler one i e mga was chosen as the optimal model the comparison of forecasting results using the fat and rc revealed that in the case of applying fat dataset the nash sutcliffe nse rate ranged from 0 99 to 0 73 for 1 hour ahead to 48 hour ahead forecasts whereas it adversely changed from 0 98 to 0 06 for the rc dataset this study demonstrates the capability of fat data in providing reliable and accurate hourly streamflow forecasting keywords group method of data handling algorithm gmdh hourly forecasting hydroacoustic 1 introduction hydrological models of streamflow forecasting are generally divided into two main categories physical and data driven decision making models the latter is more welcomed by researchers due to the less complicated relationship between environmental variables and streamflow abbasi et al 2021 tiwari and chatterjee 2010 combined the discrete wavelet transform model with the biologically annotated neural networks bann and multilayer perceptron mlp to forecast the 1 to 10 h ahead lead times streamflow of the mahanadi river in india using rating curve rc data their findings revealed that the wbann hybrid model outperformed the bann and mlp models in short term hourly forecasting alexander et al 2018 combinedthe wavelet transform signal processing modelwith the artificial neural network ann forecasting model to provide short term flood stage forecasting of the achankovil river in the indian state of kerala for 1 3 and 6 h ahead lead times the results revealed that the wavelet transform artificial neural network wtann hybrid model was more accurate than the ann model in hourly forecasting walton et al 2019 used twoclassical group method of data handling models gmdh the combinatorial gmdh algorithm cga model and the multilayer gmdh algorithm mga to forecast a 2 year flood peak in the united states in addition the authors introduced a novel model called the generalized structure of gmdh algorithm gsga the analysis of these three approaches indicated that the gsga could overcome the drawbacks of utilizing classicalmodels independently and provide more accurate forecasting aghelpour and varshavian 2020 used daily rating curve data of a hydrometric station in the zeliki river in northern iran to forecast the daily streamflow they employed two statistical models of autoregressive moving average arma and autoregressive integrated moving average arima along with three artificial intelligence ai models the classification data algorithm the multilayer perceptron algorithm mlp and the grnn the results showed that two models of the multilayer perceptron algorithm and the gmdh were more accurate in forecasting the daily streamflow kabir et al 2020 used river streamflow and meteorological data as input signals to three forecasting models of support vector regression svr deep belief network dbn and wann a hybrid of wavelet transform and ann to forecast hourly streamflow according to the results the svr approach has higher accuracy for 1 to 2 h ahead lead times forecasts than other methods but its accuracy gradually decreases as the forecast time step increases to 3 h ahead lead times and above elkurdy et al 2021 forecasted the hourly streamflow of the bow river in alberta canada using the gsga flow data from the previous nine years were used as an input to the model the results showed that the gsga model had an excellent performance to forecast up to 17 h ahead lead times wang et al 2021 used gmdh chi square automatic interaction detector chaid random forest rf and hybrid of these models with intrinsic time scale decomposition itd to forecast streamflow of the varahi river basin in the western ghats of karnataka india one three and seven days ahead the results illustrated that the hybrid models had a better performance at all lead times the fluvial acoustic tomography fat is a cutting edge hydroacoustic technology designed to continuously monitor streamflow with high accuracy time resolution two fat stations each connected to a transducer immersed in water are placed diagonally on both sides of the river fig 1 the flow velocity and streamflow data are acquired by transmitting sound waves simultaneously from these stationsusing the time of travel method bahreinimotlagh et al 2019 al sawaf et al 2017 showed that the streamflow measured by the fat is more accurate than it obtained from the rc method kawanisi et al 2018 applied the fat to measure the flow characteristics of the gono river in japan for 127 days they compared the fat data with the rc method the findings revealed that fat has higher temporal resolution and better accuracy than rc for recording high frequency oscillations of streamflow time series al sawaf and kawanisi 2019 compared the fat and rc data to measure the streamflow during a flood event the results showed that the fat had a highercapability to measure flood characteristics than the rc method al sawaf and kawanisi 2020 used fat and rc data to characterize streamflow patterns using information and complexity metrics the results showed that only the fat can capture the high frequency components of the streamflow regime al sawaf et al 2021 forecasted the flood streamflowrate of the gono river in hiroshima province japan using hydrological and meteorological data as an input to the recurrent neural network rnn model they used the flow streamflow measured by the fat system as a reference flow to evaluate the outcomes of their forecasting due to its high temporal resolution the results revealed that the rnn model cannot extrapolate to forecast floods outside of the network s training range the fat is widely applied in different rivers in china bahreini motlagh et al 2015 canada razaz et al 2016 iran bahreinimotlagh et al 2019 japan hasanabadi et al 2022 etc in all cases the comparison between fat data and the data obtained from the rc method demonstrated the higher accuracy of the former one in previous studies rc data have been used as input models to forecast the streamflow while the novelty of this research is applying the fat data as models input to demonstrate the capability of fat data on improving the short term streamflow forecasting accuracy for this purpose forecast models were fed six months of consecutive streamflow data from the gono river located in hiroshima prefecture japan the following forecast models were used multilayer gmdh algorithm mga combinatorial gmdh algorithm cga and their hybrid form with discrete wavelet transform dwt fig 2 two paths are defined for forecasting i in the first path there are time delays on the input data then this data enters forecasting networks cga and mga directly without any signal processing ii in the second path the past flow data is entered into the discrete wavelet transform and then the extracted features are entered as time series into the forecasting network in this step a time delay is considered on each time series the forecasting is made by the cga or mga model these hybrid models are called dwt cga and dwt mga 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study and data type the fat acquired gono river streamflow data over six months with a time resolution of 30 s which was reduced to 10 min by applying 20 data moving average the miyoshi city is located near to the observation site with an average temperature ranging from 8 5 to 19 4 c the average rainfall is 1492 mm year the gono river is 194 km long and consists of two main tributaries the saijo and the basen bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 the bed of this river has a gravel and boulder structure the gono river catchment area is 3900 km2 the width of this river is 115 m and the slope of the bed in the interval between the stations is 0 11 the average annual river flow at ozekiyama gauging station located about 1 1 km upstream of the fat stations is approximately 73 m3 s the rc data were collected with a time interval of 1 h from the ozekiyama gauging station by the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit japan fig 3 two types of databases have been developed as input to forecast models and discrete wavelet transform the fat method is used to prepare the first database while the rc method is used to prepare the second database according to the chart presented in fig 2 there are four different modes for short term hourly forecasting on both types of databases in the first step without signal processing on the input data short term hourly forecasting is performed by the gmdh algorithms in the next step first by discrete wavelet transform feature extraction is performed on the input data signal and then forecasting is done by gmdh methods finally the performance of the forecasts is evaluated using statistical criteria there are no tributaries or municipal sewers between fat and ozekiyama gauging stations 2 2 group method of data handling the group method of data handling gmdh is a model used in various branches of science najafzadeh et al 2018 this method was first proposed by ivakhnenko 1968 to solve high order polynomial equations gmdh can overcome the complexity of the equation and linear dependence in standard regression equations the gmdh algorithm is called a heuristic method because it can model complex systems of regression type with high degrees ivakhnenko and ivakhnenko 1995 the gmdh model consists of two classical algorithms i combinatorial gmdh algorithm cga ii multilayer gmdh algorithm mga 2 2 1 combinatorial gmdh algorithm cga the cga model is a simple model of the gmdh algorithm to avoid over fitting the forecast model the arrangement of observational data is randomly shuffled among these shuffled data 70 of the data are selected as training data and the remaining 30 as testing data then according to the k fold cross validation criteria the training data set is randomly divided into k sub samples with the same volume in each sub sample the k 1 number of the sub samples is considered as training data and one of the sub samples is considered as the validation data set in this research k is considered to be 4 which has been selected by examining different scenarios and selecting the best one with the shortest running time the input data matrix contains n observational data related to the m parameter observational data are divided into two groups training data na and testing data nb the training data is used to generate the optimal model the optimal model is constructed by minimizing the following fitness function 1 ar b 1 n b i 1 n b y i y i b 2 m i n where y i is the output per stage and y i b is the data related to evaluation a new input variable is applied to each stage and is controlled using the fitness function to increase accuracy if no improvement in the algorithm s performance is observed after adding new variables the model is stopped the first stage whose input variables in the next stages are also fixed members is defined as follows 2 y a 0 a 1 x i i 1 2 m in the next stages new variables are added to the polynomial which makes the model more complex the coefficients in these equations for each stage are obtained by the least squares method the general state of the equations in stage m is defined as follows 3 y a 0 a 1 x i a 2 x j a m x l i j l 1 2 m where a 0 a 1 a 2 a m are weight coefficients and x i x j x l are the input data in each stage cga algorithm includes six steps as follows fig 4 step 1 input data is divided into two parts training data and testing data step 2 different stage are formed to describe the complexity of the models step 3 the polynomial structure of the models is created and the coefficients of all sentences are calculated step 4 the optimal model is selected in each stage step 5 an additional model is created step 6 an additional model is made for the next stage and steps 2 to 5 are repeated if the model is improved according to the ar criterion the next stages are made again and steps 2 to 5 are completed otherwise the loop ends searching for the optimal model 2 2 2 multilayer gmdh algorithm mga the mga model is one of the classical algorithms of the gmdh model this model proceeds without going back to the previous layers and doing the calculations again it performs layer by layer calculations for each layer and selects the input of the next layer so that it finds a logical relationship between the input data and the target data this model shows an excellent ability to solve nonlinear equations shaikh et al 2019 input data is initially divided into two parts training data and target data the network training process is powered by training data which is classified into two parts internal training data and testing data in the mge model polynomials are formed to solve the problem consisting of two variables thus by pairs of variables connected a set of polynomials is created called a layer fig 5 the input layer contains the input variables in this study the past flow measurements are used valterra series polynomial known as the kolmogorov gabor polynomial can be used to define the relationship between input and output variables this polynomial is expressed by eq 4 samsudin et al 2011 4 y a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j 1 n a ij x i x j i 1 n j 1 n k 1 n a ij x i x j x k where x is the input variable a is the weight coefficient n is the number of input parameters and y is the output of each layer since each polynomial is made up of only two input variables eq 5 is shown as a quadratic equation as follows 5 y z ij a 0 a i x i a j x j a ij x i x j a ii x i 2 a jj x j 2 in each layer to calculate the output six weight factors must be calculated each layer consists of input data pairs x i x j i j 1 2 n for which there is also a corresponding output z ij i j 1 2 n in other words an equation system with n equations containing six unknown parameters must be solved the least squares method can be used to obtain coefficients of a walton et al 2019 the forecasting steps of the mga algorithm are as follows farlow 1984 step 1 the input data is divided into two parts training data and testing data step 2 a new variable is created using c m 2 m m 1 2 for the training data set then by constructing quadratic polynomials of eq 5 for the first layer weight coefficients are obtained by the least squares method step 3 the output of the nodes with less rmse is substituted for the input data column x and new variables zij are created for the next layers step 4 steps 2 and 3 are repeated and this process is established until one of the following two conditions is met i the rmse of the test data in each layer stops decreasing ii the network reaches its maximum number of defined layers 2 3 discrete wavelet transform wavelet transform is one of the main signal processing tools that decomposes the signal into two domains of time and frequency liu et al 2014 wavelet transform extracts some signal information which is considered as hidden features of the signal these features cannot be extracted from the original signal without signal processing there is a concept in the wavelet transform process called tree decomposition ergen 2012 one of the main purposes of using wavelet transform is to decompose the signal in several steps by using wavelets as high pass and low pass filters during this process after the feature extracting by the wavelets in the first level the signal is divided into a low frequency component or base signal a and a high frequency component or details ds adamowski and chan 2011 it is necessary to explain the performance of the wavelet transform the input signal in this study past flow enters the wavelet transform model as input and it is decomposed in the first level of decomposition into an approximate a and detail ds in the next level the approximate is also decomposed to a new approximate and detail the last approximate and other details can reconstruct the signal fig 6 fig 7 shows discrete wavelet transform hybrid models and cga and mga algorithms in this research after trial and error the haar wavelet transform with two decomposition levels is selected as the optimal model of the discrete wavelet transform in the dwt gmbh hybrid model after decomposition of the input data the approximate a and the details d1 and d2 are entered as input into the gmdh model that is why in fig 7 each of the a d1 and d2 is passed into the mga and cga models in other words the forecast is made on three time series finally the forecasting results of each of them are aggregated together and the forecasted streamflow is obtained for the two databases of fat and rc a short term hourly forecast has been done for 1 6 12 and 24 hour lead times 2 4 performance evaluation criteria to assess the efficacy of the forecasting models employed in this study pearson s correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute relative error mare are used as follows 6 r l 1 n o l o p l p l 1 n o l o 2 l 1 n p l p 2 7 mae 1 n l 1 n o l p l 8 rmse l 1 n o l p l 2 n 9 mare 1 n l 1 n o l p l o l where o l and p l are the observed streamflow and forecasted streamflow values respectively o and p are observed streamflow mean value and forecasted streamflow mean value respectively also n is the total number of input data points mae and rmse parameters show the accuracy of fitting and deviation between the observed data and the forecasted values the rmse index shows the normal distribution of the forecasted error and is not suitable for all forecasting models rmse is more appropriate than the mae for normal error distribution chai and draxler 2014 the mae index is used to calculate the absolute value of the difference between the observed and forecasted values yaseen et al 2017 mare indicates the relative error between the forecasted and observed values it is a measure of the average performance of the model which shows the distribution of the forecast error zero mare shows the best performance and an increase in its value indicates a decrease in model accuracy wieprecht et al 2013 the r index is also a value between 1 and 1 that indicates the covariance of the forecasted data this criterion shows the correlation between the two variables when r is 1 it means a positive correlation when it is 0 it means no correlation and 1 means negative correlation sedgwick 2012 furthermore to evaluate the models and identify the optimal model the nash sutcliffe coefficient has been used which is as follows 10 nse 1 i 1 n q o i q f i 2 i 1 n q o i q o i n s e 1 where q o i q f i and q o i are the observed streamflow forecasted streamflow and the observed streamflow mean values respectively the closer the nash sutcliffe criterion to 1 the better the model s performance nash and sutcliffe 1970 nash sutcliffe is a statistical measure of a model s ability to forecast flows that differ from the mean the range of variations of this coefficient is from 1 to 1 for the best fit and for the worst case dawson and wilby 2001 a nash value above 0 9 indicates the good performance of the model it indicates relatively acceptable performance when it is between 0 9 and 0 8 and poor performance when it is below 0 8 shamseldin 1997 3 results and discussion the short term forecasting is made for 1 2 6 12 18 24 and 48 hour lead times to investigate the effect of input database type on the accuracy of the forecasts all the mentioned processes are performed for two databases of fat and rc to extract the signal features haar wavelet daubechies wavelet 2 to 4 and meyer wavelet 1 to 3 are used for both cga and mga models the results for three decomposition levels l2 l3 l4 for one hour ahead forecast are presented in table a1 for all decomposition levels and different wavelets the lowest rmse is related to haar wavelet and decomposition level 2 therefore the extraction of streamflow signal properties for dwt mga and dwt cga hybrid models has been performed using haar wavelet and decomposition level 2 as illustrated in fig 8 the fat and the rc data are decomposed by discrete wavelet transform into low frequency a and high frequency d components a d and c show the d1 d2 and a components of fat data respectively d e and f show the d1 d2 and a components of rc data respectively table 1 indicates the statistical evaluation of short term forecasting the results show that all classical and hybrid forecasting models presented for short term forecasting performed on fat data are generally more accurate than rc data the reason is that the fat data were taken with higher accuracy and temporal resolution than the rc data which has been previously demonstrated al sawaf and kawanisi 2019 bahreinimotlagh et al 2019 kawanisi et al 2016 as a result using fat data has led to more accurate results for the forecast algorithm the accuracy results of the forecasts made on both types of input databases by all forecasting models show that the highest accuracy belongs to a 1 hour ahead forecast the results show that by increasing the time step of the forecast its accuracy is reduced the cga model is a simple model of gmdh but the mga model is more complex than the cga according to the values presented in table 1 the mga model shows a better performance than the cga comparing all statistical criteria between these two models for lead times of 1 to 48 h confirms this the mga also performs better than cga for the 6 12 and 24 h lead times for forecasting on the rc database however for the 1 h ahead forecast on rc data the cga and mga models have produced almost the same results according to the nash sutcliffe and mare criteria the mga model yielded accuracy values of 0 98 and 0 02 respectively according to the rmse and mae criteria with 4 12 and 1 55 values respectively the cga model was slightly more accurate than the mga model according to the comparison made for the forecasts of the two classic gmdh models for both the rc input database and the fat it can be concluded that the mga model performs better than the cga model the results of combining dwt and gmdh forecasting models showed that the dwt mga model is a successful model in short term forecasting as presented in table 1 forecasting on fat data with 6 12 18 24 and 48 hour lead time and rc data with 1 hour lead time have increased the forecast accuracy compared to the mga model even in cases that do not show an increase in the accuracy of the mga model the difference from the results of the mga model is negligible for example the comparison of rmse values between the 24 hour forecasts made for the fat and rc databases are equal to 42 05 and 42 98 respectively thus this slight difference can be ignored the performance of hybrid models for fat data is also better than those of rc because the fat captures more details of the fluctuation than the rc method based on the occam s razor theory between two models with similar results the simpler model is the optimal model blumer et al 1987 sorkin 1983 due to the fact that the difference between the two models of mga and dwt mga is negligible it is better to accept the simpler model i e mga as the optimal one the hybrid cga and dwt models reduced the accuracy of short term hourly forecasts compared to other models this reduction in accuracy has been observed for both fat and rc databases the cga model is a simpler model than the mga model and is a single layer gmdh model wavelet transform by extracting input signal features provides more details to the forecasts model which further complicates the model the cga model as a simpler model than the mga model has not been able to find the mathematical relationship between these details for better forecasting the dwt cga hybrid model has less accuracy than the other models presented in this research as mentioned in subsection 2 2 the mge model s structure is multi layered so the layers structure of this model is important fig 9 shows the network structure of the layers in mga for the best result i e a one hour lead time the model achieved the best fit in this case by forming three layers the last layer polynomial of the mga and dwt mga models as well as the best polynomial of the cga and dwt cga models are shown in table a2 and table a3 respectively for the fat and rc databases fig 10 shows the scattering diagrams for the mga model selected as the optimal model among all the proposed models for 1 6 and 24 hour ahead lead times in this case study according to these diagrams the best fit belongs to 1 hour forecasts on fat data typically as the lead times increase the accuracy of the forecasting decreases and consequently the scatter of the data increases in all forecast modes these diagrams for the forecasting made on the fat data show less scatter than those made on the rc data in other words the correlations between the forecasting and the observational streamflow for fat data are more significant than those for the rc data this correlation decreases with increasing lead time for example the 48 hour ahead forecast has the lowest correlation the streamflow is also divided into high and low periods the streamflow with an observational value of more than 200 m3 s is defined as a high period and less than 200 m3 s as low period statistical analysis for each period reveals that scattering degree is very small in the low streamflow period and for most lead times model performance is more precise in the low streamflow period also for 6 h to 48 h lead times the accuracy of the models decreases more for high streamflow periods than low streamflow periods fig a1e n fig 11 and fig a2 compares the observed and the forecasted streamflows by the mga model on the fat and rc data as explained earlier these forecastings were more accurate for fat data than for rc data on 30 01 2016 the most significant flood with a magnitude of 424 m3 s for fat and 440 m3 s for rc occurred but there was no flood with this magnitude in the observation period this flood peak is forecasted by the mga algorithm for lead times of 1 to 6 h with acceptable accuracy for both databases the forecasted values for the lead time of 6 h ahead on the fat and rc data are 403 and 421 m3 s respectively fig 11e and f however the forecasts for 24 and 48 h ahead for both databases are less accurate and the forecasted flow rate is less than the observed flow rate for example the forecasted streamflow value for a 24 h ahead for the fat and rc databases are 279 m3 s and 229 m3 s respectively fig 11e and f due to the new flood characteristics the mga algorithm cannot forecast this flood well for 12 to 48 h ahead of lead times for two consecutive days on 26 03 2016 and 25 03 2016 the upstream dams haji and haizuka flushed as a result two successive peaks are seen in fig 11 for these two days this flood does not have a natural pattern and does not follow the hydrological trend of the river given that the rc data has less information than fat data on the momentary changes of the flood streamflow for 6 to 48 hour ahead lead times the streamflow at these two artificial flood peaks is not well forecasted by the mga algorithm for rc data however these two peaks were well forecasted for fat data even for a 24 hour ahead fig 11c to d this can be related to the high temporal resolution of the fat system as it captures more details of streamflow fluctuations to determine the role of fat data in increasing the accuracy of forecasting with the mga model which was selected as the optimal model forecasting on fat data with one hour time step performed for 1 2 6 12 18 24 and 48 hour lead times and the results were compared with the forecasting made on the rc data results according to table 2 the forecasting accuracy in these conditions for time intervals of 1 2 and 6 h is almost the same for both rc and fat data types however with increasing the time step of forecasting 12 18 24 and 48 hour lead time forecasting accuracy for fat data becomes more than rc data as illustrated in fig 12 fat technology allows researchers to capture data with higher time resolution and higher accuracy therefore in addition to high temporal resolution of fat data the nature of this data can also increase the accuracy of forecasting 4 conclusion in this study we demonstrated the better performance of fat data on the accuracy of short term forecasting compared with the traditional rc data the dwt mga hybrid model showed that discrete wavelet transforms in four lead times 1 h rc 6 h fat 12 h fat and 24 h fat increased the accuracy of the forecasts however due to the slight difference between the two models mga and dwt mga based on the concept of the occam s razor the simpler model i e mga was selected as the optimal model in this study among the forecasting models the highest accuracy has always been related to the forecasting made on the fat data this is one of the reasons why fat technology is effective in short term forecasting accuracy for example the nash sutcliffe and rmse values for the 12 h ahead forecasting for the mga model on fat data is 0 96 and 8 463 m3 s respectively whereas these values reach 0 65 and 29 445 m3 s respectively for 12 h ahead forecasting on rc data as a result one of the factors affecting the forecasting accuracy performed by data driven models is the accuracy of the input database to these models fat as one of the hydroacoustic instruments for data collection with high accuracy and temporal resolution compared to traditional methods such as the rc method can increase the accuracy of forecasting credit authorship contribution statement yousef olfatmiri methodology masoud bahreinimotlagh writing original draft supervision ebrahim jabbari

3388,it has been known that groundwater lake water interaction plays an important role in mass exchange between land and lakes however most of the lakes in the world freeze during the winter and few studies of groundwater and surface water interaction groundwater discharge tracing focus on ice covered lakes this study investigated groundwater discharge into a large ice covered lake xiao qaidam lake in the tibetan plateau tp using satellite remote sensing and chemical and isotopic tracing analysis of chemical components stable isotopes d 18o and 222rn revealed that groundwater discharge occurred in the western and southern portions of xiao qaidam lake remote sensing data the distribution of and variation in lake surface temperature lst revealed these locations of groundwater discharge and indicated additional groundwater discharge in areas of springs based on the regression model between lst and 222rn activity in lake water and 222rn mass balance model the groundwater discharge into xiao qaidam lake was estimated to be 2 77 0 26 105 m3 d which is slightly higher than river water input at summer in addition this study also suggests that ice melting process should be considered when tracing groundwater discharge into an ice covered lake and that the lst distribution during the icing period is better than the lst variation for tracing groundwater discharge because the ice eliminated noise from wind and surface water the study provides insight into the tracing of groundwater discharge into large ice covered lakes in the tp and elsewhere keywords groundwater

breeds many glacial lakes it is the highest altitude plateau inland lake area with the largest number of lakes and the largest total lake area lei et al 2017 the lakes in the tp account for nearly

qaidam basin lv et al 2017 this lake emerged in the late pleistocene at an altitude of 3173 m during the study period it had an average depth of 2 6 m and a maximum depth of approximately 4 m and its area was approximately 100 km2 the xqd lake area experiences a continental arid climate with an average annual temperature of approximately 4 1960 2016 du et al 2016 the average annual evaporation is more than 2000 mm 1960 2016 the average annual precipitation is approximately 195 mm 1960 2016 and more than 80 of it occurs in may september to the northeast northwest and south of xqd lake are mountains composed of sinian metamorphic rocks and hills composed of tertiary mudstone and sandstone are found to the west fig 2 close to the lake quaternary diluvial sediments composed of sand and gravel occurred in the west and quaternary lacustrine and swamp sediments composed of clay and muddy silt are found to the east fig 2 around xqd lake there are quaternary unconsolidated sediments that contain some mirabilite lenses and gypsum crystals du et al 2016 the tataling river which originates from the qilian mountains flows into xqd lake from the northwest fig 1a the lower reaches of the tataling river usually dry up during the dry season and can only reach the lake during the wet season madsen et al 2014 qu 1981 the xqd lake is a terminal lake in the endorheic basin and has no outflow the groundwater around xqd lake flowing from mountains to the lake is an important water source for the towns surrounding the study area chen 2019 a dam composed of clay and gravel was built to deliver groundwater from the northwest to the east of the lake through pipes this dam also divided xqd lake into two parts and lake waters flow from the north water body into the south water body through two tunnels under the dam fig 1 the depth and width of one tunnel are 5 3 m and 17 2 m and the depth and width of the other are 3 6 m 15 0 m respectively due to continuous climate change that causes the increasing precipitation and glacial melt the area of xqd lake has expanded from approximately 40 km2 in the 1990s du et al 2016 to nearly 100 km2 in recent years seriously damaging residential buildings and threatening engineering facilities e g highways dams and well facilities around the lake fig 1 during the winter xqd lake is entirely covered by ice the water body north of the dam develops thick ice and is difficult to access to collect lake water samples therefore most of the lake samples in this study were collected from the south water body which is the main water body of xqd lake the analysis thus only addresses the south water body 2 2 field work and analytical methods 2 2 1 field work operation field work for this study was conducted from march 4 to march 9 2019 when xqd lake was ice covered a total of 55 water samples were collected including 7 groundwater samples 9 pore water samples 34 lake water samples and 5 ice samples in addition two bottom sediment samples 0 10 cm were collected one was taken from the west shore of xqd lake and the other was taken from the east shore groundwater samples were obtained from residential wells and springs for sampling in wells water was removed from the well bore by pumping for 5 min before groundwater was collected liao et al 2018 pore water was collected from a depth of 10 50 cm under the sediment using a pushing point sampler luo et al 2016 to sample the lake water under the ice we made a hole in the ice with an ice cutter the lake water was collected after removing the surface lake water containing floating ice to avoid the impact of ice melting ice samples collected from different depths were tested after the ice had melted the physical parameters of all water samples were measured in the field redox potential orp temperature t and ph were tested using a multi parameter device clean co and a salinity meter az instrument co was used to measure the salinity the process of water sample collection depended on the type of test that was to be conducted water samples to be used for measurement of cations ca k na mg were placed in 100 ml brown pre washed polyethylene bottles and then acidified with hno3 65 to adjust the ph to less than 2 samples for analysis of anions cl so4 hco3 co3 no3 and stable isotopes d and 18o were directly collected into 60 ml and 30 ml brown washed polyethylene bottles respectively when collecting water samples for radon analysis it is essential to avoid contact of the sample with air samples 250 ml of groundwater and pore water were carefully collected for the measurement of 222rn using the rad7 h2o durrdge co and 2 5 l samples of lake water and ice were collected for 222rn analysis using the rad7 big bottle system durrdge co luo et al 2018 the 222rn in ice were tested after the ice melted in the sealed 2 5 l glass bottle the uncertainty of discrete 222rn measurement in situ ranged from 10 to 25 in this study at 9 00 19 00 on march 7 2019 continuous 222rn monitoring was performed using a rad7 aqua durrdge co on the west side of xqd lake near the lcb point fig 1 a peristaltic pump was used to pump lake water from a depth of 0 5 m under the ice into the chamber of the rad7 aqua at a flow rate of 3 4 l min the 222rn activity was recorded every 10 min using the protocol of sniff luo et al 2018 the wind speed and air temperature were monitored at the same time the uncertainty of continuous 222rn measurement was approximately 50 60 this may be related to the use of a slow flow rate 2 2 2 chemical components measurement the major ions k na ca mg cl so4 hco3 no3 were measured in the key laboratory of crustal dynamics institute of crustal dynamics china earthquake administration using an ion chromatography system ics 2000 dionex co since the high salinity of the water in xqd lake reduces the precision and results in drift of the stable isotope d and 18o measurements luo et al 2017 this study used an automatic vacuum condensation extraction system lica united technology co ltd to remove salinity this system can condense and collect water vapor in a low temperature environment without isotopic fractionation a liquid water isotope analyzer lwia 24d at the isotope laboratory of china university of geosciences beijing was then used to measure the values of δd and δ18o with precisions of 0 3 and 0 1 respectively liao et al 2018 2 3 groundwater discharge tracing methods 2 3 1 satellite remote sensing data the use of satellite or airborne thermal remote sensing data to trace groundwater discharge into surface water is a novel approach that has been employed in recent years kelly et al 2019 lee et al 2016 mallast et al 2014 wilson and rocha 2012 for studies at large spatial scales landsat data are cost effective and can provide the spatially distributed surface temperature of water bodies lake surface temperature lst wilson and rocha 2012 the principle of using satellite remote sensing data to trace groundwater discharge into surface water is based on the difference between groundwater temperature and lst fig s1 kelly et al 2019 lee et al 2016 mallast et al 2014 wilson and rocha 2012 this difference is reflected in two aspects 1 the different temperature variation over a given period the temperature variation in groundwater is smaller than that in lake water since the latter is susceptible to changes in air temperature which varied significantly in both diurnal and seasonal scales wilson and rocha 2012 2 the different temperature value in northern latitudes surface water will be warmer than groundwater during the summer months and colder than groundwater during the winter months pluhowski 1972 tamborski et al 2015 in the use of landsat data to trace groundwater discharge the first principle depended on different temperature variation is usually applied mallast et al 2014 wilson and rocha 2012 in addition the method of using landsat data to retrieve the surface temperature of the water body has a high precision of approximately 1 2 k wilson and rocha 2012 wloczyk et al 2006 this high precision provides a foundation for tracing groundwater using landsat data a total of 13 satellite images obtained by landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli path 136 row 34 between january 2018 and march 2019 with cloud cover less than 30 were acquired from https earthexplorer usgs gov table s1 the images in february and march 2019 in which there were many clouds over xqd lake were excluded all data were projected to utm wgs 84 zone 46 n to determine the surface temperature of the lake lst it is first necessary to accurately extract the water features of xqd lake to avoid the influence of land temperature on the lst although many water indices including the normalized difference water index ndwi the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the water ratio index wri the automated water extraction index awei the normalized difference moisture index ndmi and the modified ndwi mndwi have been proposed for the extraction of water features acharya et al 2018 mcfeeters 1996 rokni et al 2014 xu 2006 rokni et al 2014 found that ndwi is the best water index for lakes hence this study employed the ndwi to extract the water features of xqd lake the ndwi can be expressed as 1 n d w i g r e e n n i r g r e e n n i r the land type around xqd lake is simple wetland and bare land figs 1 and 2 there is little environmental noise e g shadows built up areas snow around this lake thus the ndwi threshold with a value of 0 0 5 table s1 was determined based on land types from satellite images there are several steps in retrieving true lst using image processing software envi 5 1 in this study the raw space borne digital numbers dn which reflect converted thermal radiance at satellite or top of atmosphere toa radiance were reconverted to calibrate gain and bias the relevant equation chander et al 2009 mallast et al 2014 wilson and rocha 2012 is 2 l t o a m l d n a l where l t o a is the spectral radiance at the sensor w m 2 sr 1 μm 1 m l gain and a l bias or offset are the radiometric calibration coefficients in the image product header file w m 2 sr 1 μm 1 and dn is the digital number in each pixel of band 6 for landsat 7 etm and band 10 for landsat 8 oli the l t o a which includes downwelling radiance from the sky upwelling radiance from the atmosphere and radiance emitted from the earth s surface is not true surface radiance to remove these atmospheric effects in the thermal region a radiative transfer model atmospheric correction parameter calculator acpc was employed wilson and rocha 2012 this model which can be operated on the public web estimates the atmospheric transmission upwelling radiance and downwelling radiance based on the input of image acquisition date time and geographical locations barsi et al 2003 raj and fleming 2008 after integrating those values the surface radiances converted from the toa radiance can be used in the following equation mallast et al 2014 wilson and rocha 2012 3 l t l t o a l u τ 1 ε l d τ ε where l t is the surface radiance of an ideal black body w m 2 sr 1 μm 1 τ is atmospheric transmissivity ε is surface emissivity unitless and l u and l d are the upwelling radiance and the downwelling radiance respectively w m 2 sr 1 μm 1 the values of τ l u and l d estimated by acpc were present in table s1 as to the surface emissivity previous studies demonstrated that water emissivity generally varies from 0 97 to 0 99 over the wavelength range of 8 14 µm chander et al 2009 fei et al 2015 salisbury and d aria 1992 snyder et al 1998 and that for salt water use of the lower value of 0 97 is better mallast et al 2014 wen yao et al 1987 this study adopted a value of 0 97 as the water emissivity for all images finally the lst t s was calculated by planck s radiation law which employed two prelaunch calibration constants as follows 4 t s k 2 l n k 1 l t 1 273 15 where k 1 and k 2 are prelaunch thermal calibration constants equal to 666 09 w m 2 sr 1 μm 1 and 1282 71 k respectively mallast et al 2014 for landsat 7 data and 774 89 w m 2 sr 1 μm 1 and 1321 08 k respectively for landsat 8 data singh et al 2018 generally the error of t s estimated by landsat is approximately 1 4 k wloczyk et al 2006 as in previous studies this study employed the standard deviation sd to depict lst variation to distinguish temperature anomalies that could be used to trace groundwater discharge mallast et al 2014 wilson and rocha 2012 the sd can be expressed as 5 sd 1 n i 1 n t s i t s 2 where n is the number of images equal to 11 in this case t s i is the lst specific to each pixel in the ith image and t s is the average temperature specific to each pixel for all the images the s d lst variation in some regions can be much less than in the surrounding regions that shows an anomalous signal and offers the potential to trace groundwater discharge mallast et al 2014 wilson and rocha 2012 2 3 2 222rn tracer and its mass balance model the radon isotope 222rn which has a half life of 3 83 days is produced by 226ra and decays to 218po hoehn and von gunten 1989 radium containing minerals are common in aquifers and continuously produce radon which remains as a dissolved gas in groundwater until its decay in contrast radon in surface water e g rivers and lakes tends to decrease rapidly through loss by decay and diffusion into the atmosphere luo et al 2018 generally the level of radon in surface water is 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of radon in groundwater burnett et al 2007 the significant difference in radon activity between groundwater and surface water has been exploited to trace groundwater discharge into ponds rivers lakes and oceans cook et al 2018 corbett et al 1997 dimova and burnett 2011 gilfedder et al 2015 in addition the 222rn mass balance model has also been extensively used to estimate groundwater discharge flux burnett and dulaiova 2006 dimova and burnett 2011 gleeson et al 2009 zhang et al 2015b for the xqd lake the radon in lake water originates from groundwater input radium production and sediment diffusion and is lost by decay and atmospheric evasion the 222rn mass balance model can be expressed as 6 i r n t c g w j f d i f f c r a λ v f a t m c w v λ where i r n represents 222rn inventory in xqd lake body c w c g w and c r a are the 222rn activity in lake water and groundwater and the 226ra activity in lake water bq m3 respectively j is the groundwater discharge flux into xqd lake m3 d f d i f f and f a t m represent sediment diffusion and atmospheric evasion bq d respectively v is the volume of xqd lake during the frozen period λ is the decay constant of 222rn 0 186 d 1 and t is the time d recent studies demonstrated that most lakes cannot be treated as being in a steady state due to variable 222rn atmospheric evasion driven by wind induced turbulence dimova and burnett 2011 gilfedder et al 2015 xin luo et al 2018 however in the frozen period the 222rn in lake water was less affected by wind speed see below in addition the changes of lake water volume is limited during frozen period in the short time scale of 222rn method days to weeks liao et al 2018 and to some extent the adding loss of lake 222rn has little effect on the result of groundwater discharge estimation because of much higher 222rn concentration in groundwater than in lake water luo et al 2018 thus this study adopted a steady state 222rn mass balance model assuming that i r n t was equal to zero sediment diffusion f d i f f which occurs at the sediment water interface due to the significant difference in 222rn activity between lake water and pore water in sediment is an important source of 222rn in lake water the sediment diffusion flux can be estimated by the following equation cable et al 1996 xin luo et al 2016 martens et al 1980 7 f d i f f d s λ 0 5 c p c w a where a is the area of lakebed which approximates to the area of lake surface c p is the average 222rn activity of pore water in sediments bq m3 and can be obtained from the sediment equilibration experiments corbett et al 1998 d s is the 222rn molecular diffusion coefficient m d which can be described as follows boudreau 1996 dimova and burnett 2011 schulz 2006 8 d s 10 980 t 1 59 1 ln n 2 2 where t is the lake water temperature k and n is the sediment porosity unitless for ice free lakes atmospheric evasion depending upon wind speed and temperature is one of the dominant sinks liao et al 2018 luo et al 2016 schubert et al 2012 however recent studies have revealed that atmospheric evasion is much lower during the frozen period since the ice blocks the exchange between lake water and air arnoux et al 2017 loose et al 2017 this study conducted continuous 222rn monitoring of lake water in the ice covered lake and found that the level of 222rn in frozen lake water was not related to wind speed or temperature and remained stable during the monitoring fig 3 thus atmospheric evasion which is important to consider when evaluating ice free lakes was neglected for ice covered lakes combining equations 6 7 and 8 the groundwater discharge flux can be expressed as 9 j c w c ra v λ 10 980 t 1 59 1 ln n 2 2 λ 0 5 c p c w a c gw 3 results 3 1 geochemical features all waters sampled lake water pore water and groundwater were alkaline ph generally ranging from 8 to 9 the orp varied more for lake water than for groundwater and pore water with a range of 298 mv to 210 mv for lake water 99 mv to 156 mv for groundwater and 46 mv to 176 mv for pore water groundwater salinity 0 18 0 83 ppt was much less than salinity of lake water 12 5 40 09 ppt and the salinity in pore water varied between these two extremes ranging from 4 39 ppt to 30 6 ppt table 1 except for ca and no3 the concentrations of major ion components were much higher in lake water than in the other waters sampled ice pore water and groundwater such as cl which was approximately two orders of magnitude higher in lake water than in groundwater table 1 while the average ca concentration in pore water 497 15 mg l was approximately twice that in lake water 191 23 mg l and no3 was slightly higher in pore water 11 48 mg l than in lake water 8 89 mg l high no3 in pore water may originate from animal husbandry around the xqd lake the radon activity in lake water varied over two orders of magnitude from 34 bq m3 to 2056 bq m3 but it was still far lower than that in pore water and groundwater the average radon activity in lake water was an order of magnitude smaller than that in pore water and was 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that in groundwater table 1 lake water close to land is likely to retain the characteristics of groundwater roy 2019 here we used lake water within 50 m of the shore of xqd lake to trace groundwater discharge fig 4 the conservative elements k na cl showed the same distribution highly concentrated in the north and east the distribution of so4 and mg was similar high ca concentrations were found at l4 and l13 in the west and south of xqd lake the distribution of no3 presented no such spatial variation salinity in the western and southern parts of xqd lake was lower than that in the east and north the distribution of 222rn in lake water was mostly opposite to that of salinity k na and cl 222rn activity is higher in the western and southern than that in the eastern and northern parts of xqd lake fig 4 3 2 stable isotopes the stable isotopes δd δ18o in various water bodies showed a generally depletion trend in the following order ice lake water pore water and groundwater table 1 as shown in fig 5 the δd and δ18o of groundwater were distributed near the global meteoric water line gmwl indicating limited post depositional isotopic modification from precipitation zhao et al 2018 the trend of the lake water was at an angle with the gmwl with a slope of 5 53 black dotted line in fig 5 indicating that the lake water had undergone relatively marked evaporation birks et al 2017 the ice samples were at the end of the evaporation trend line consistent with the enrichment of heavy isotopes in the ice formed from the lake water toyota et al 2013 the pore water in xqd lake was divided into two regions one in the groundwater region and the other near the lake water region 3 3 remote sensing data the lst of xqd lake measured each month during 2018 is shown in fig 6 since 2003 the landsat 7 etm airborne scan line corrector slc has malfunctioned resulting in missing data bands in the acquired image the images obtained in april september and november were landsat 7 data and showed many bands indicating that data from these regions were missing this study adopted inverse distance weight interpolation to compensate for these missing data xqd lake had high lst in july and august and low lst in january and december fig 6 sd in fig 7 a represents the lst variation calculated by lst distribution in each month except june of 2018 because the area of lst distribution is different in each month fig 6 and the minimum area of lst distribution in may dominates the area of lst variation map the area of the lst variation map was smaller than the area of xqd lake when ice covered in december see fig 7a at the two tunnel outlets below the dam the lst variation was anomalous showing a smaller lst variation than the surroundings fig 7b illustrates the lake freezing process during november the water area the area with higher temperature than the ice area in fig 7b is similar to the middle area with a small lst variation fig 7a 4 discussion 4 1 ice melting process for ice free lakes the factors that affect solute concentrations in lake water are river water input groundwater input evaporation temperature variation redox environment and acid base environment luo et al 2018 in winter lake water is isolated by surface ice thus the evaporation of ice covered lake water can be ignored solutes in saline lake water are much higher than that in groundwater the temperature variation of lake water in this study thus has limited effect on the solutes concentrations the redox environment only affects the active elements e g fe mn as etc and has little effect on the conservative solutes we employed as tracers in this study variations in ph were negligible and thus can also be ignored table 1 during the winter river water is frozen thus the river water input to xqd lake is negligible and groundwater input assumes greater significance for solutes in ice covered lakes ice melting process must also be considered for a lake covered by ice the impact of ice melting on the solutes present in the lake water cannot be avoided especially in the case of lakeshore water that is covered by thin ice even if the sampling is conducted very carefully lake water mixed with the water produced by ice melting is inevitably collected for two reasons 1 at night the air temperature decreased leading to freezing while during the daytime when fieldwork was conducted the air temperature increased resulting in ice melting ashton 1980 2 discharge of groundwater at a temperature above freezing could melt ice at the groundwater lake water interface the solute content of ice water is usually low therefore if ice melting is not excluded the salinity conductivity previous studies e g harvey et al 1997 applied to trace groundwater discharge into salt lakes and oceans is unsuitable for a frozen lake in fig 4 the lower na cl concentrations and salinity at the west and south of xqd lake may indicate groundwater discharge or may have been affected by ice melting see section 4 2 ice has relatively heavy stable isotope values due to strong fractionation toyota et al 2013 while groundwater possesses light stable isotope values fig 5 the significant difference in stable isotope values between ice and groundwater can be used to identify groundwater discharge and monitor the ice melting process the shore lake water at l14 and lx4 located at the south and west of xqd lake respectively had low salinity fig 4a but the levels of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water located at the ice region shown in fig 5 are higher than those in other lake water consequently it can be inferred that l14 and lx4 were the main areas affected by the ice melting process in addition the 222rn concentration is much higher in groundwater than in ice table 1 thus the lake water dominated by ice melting would have a low 222rn concentration such as l14 fig 4b 4 2 groundwater discharge tracing 4 2 1 chemical components stable isotopes and 222rn after long term evaporation solutes become concentrated the salinity of the salt lake e g xqd lake is therefore much higher than that of groundwater hence measurement of salinity and the levels of conservative elements can be used to identify groundwater discharge bussmann and suess 1998 luo et al 2016 excluding the lake water l14 and lx4 affected by the ice melting process the much lower salinity na and cl concentrations observed in the south and west of xqd lake compared to that in the eastern and northern lake regions indicated that groundwater discharge may occur in these regions at l4 in the west and l13 in the south the 222rn concentration in lake water is much higher than that in other lake water samples fig 4b it indicated that groundwater discharge occurred in those locations in some areas where groundwater discharge may have occurred eg near l8 the no3 level in the lake water was relatively high fig 4a and h the groundwater borne nitrate may threaten the lake s ecological system kong et al 2019 liao et al 2018 the stable isotope compositions of pore water samples shown in fig 5 could be divided into two groups one which has the same characteristics as groundwater was located in the groundwater area and the other was close to the lake water area implying that the latter group of pore waters was dominated by lake water the domination of pore waters by lake water may be caused by either the variable density flow that lake water with higher density than groundwater moved downward from the lake bed cooper 1959 simmons et al 1999 wooding 2007 zhang et al 2020 or lake water have somewhat entered the sampling instrument when we collected pore water nevertheless fig 5 shows that some of the lake water samples were located between two pore water regions indicating that these lake water samples were affected by groundwater discharge in fact the lake water samples that were located between two pore water regions eg samples l4 c1 and l8 were also inferred to be groundwater dominated based on their salinity levels and on the concentration of conservative elements described above fig 4a 222rn is an effective tracer to locate groundwater discharge chanyotha et al 2014 xu et al 2014 relatively high 222rn concentration in the lake water samples between two pore water regions also supported that these lake samples were groundwater dominated 4 2 2 lake surface temperature lst tracing groundwater discharge through direct measurement and water sampling i e chemical components and isotopes can only indicate that there is groundwater discharge at the point scale kalbus et al 2006 the precision of results extrapolated from point to region depends upon the interval of measurement or sampling higher precision which requires more samples and is more costly is difficult to achieve in the frozen area however calculation of lake surface temperature using remote sensing data is a cost effective method of tracing groundwater discharge at the regional scale mallast and siebert 2019 in xqd lake the lst variation i e sd in fig 7a was much smaller in the west than in the east indicating that groundwater discharge may occur in the west this conclusion is consistent with that inferred based on the concentrations of chemical components salinity na cl and isotopes d and 18o and 222rn in the central area of xqd lake which is not the deepest area of the lake there was a band shaped anomalous zone with a small lst variation fig 7a this area corresponds to the area that freezes last during the icing process fig 7b it was speculated that groundwater discharge may also occur in this area groundwater discharge made the overlying lake warmer and caused the area to freeze later since the lst variation map was depended upon the smallest area of lst distribution image among all used images the image in may in this study see section 3 3 the lst variation map would miss some areas compared to lst distributions in some months e g december in this study fig 7a thus groundwater discharge information for some areas is missing the temperature gap between groundwater and lake water reaches a maximum during the winter period approximately 10 fig s1 if groundwater with higher temperature is discharged into the lake the temperature of the lake water will increase fig 8 shows the lst distribution in xqd lake during the frozen period december 2018 it can be found that the lake water areas with relatively high temperatures correspond to the areas that show low lst variation small sd in fig 7a furthermore the map of lst distribution in xqd lake during the icing period can trace the groundwater discharge areas that the lst variation map did not identify such as the abnormally high temperature zone near the north of xqd lake in the remote sensing image obtained during the ice free period numerous groundwater springs could be identified within the lake fig 8 and the distribution of these springs was similar to that of the high temperature zone the lst distribution during the frozen period also showed higher temperatures in the west and south of xqd lake than in the north and east similar to the conclusion presented in section 4 2 1 mapping of lst distribution appears to be an ideal tool for tracing groundwater discharge during the frozen period however in other seasons the map of lst distribution calculated by remote sensing data cannot be used to identify groundwater discharge fig s2 previous studies also have rarely used maps of lst distribution in a single season to trace groundwater discharge the main reasons that tracing groundwater discharge based on the map of lst distribution is effective only during the period in which the lake is frozen may be 1 in the ice free period the heterogeneity of wind speed and water flow on the lake surface has an impact on the lst mallast et al 2014 making it impossible to identify the changes in lst caused by groundwater discharge while during the ice covered period the flat ice layer causes the air effect on lst to be uniform 2 the temperature difference between groundwater and lake water is large enough during the frozen period fig s1 that the effect of groundwater on lst is significant 3 in the ice free period input from river water or surface runoff will affect lst in a manner similar to groundwater mallast et al 2014 while during the frozen period most river waters are frozen and do not flow into the lake this part of the study found that based on chemical and isotopic compositions and the distribution map of lst groundwater discharge was obviously more significant in the west of xqd lake than in the east the occurrence of groundwater discharge may be related to the types of sediments present in xqd lake the sediment in the east is small grained clay while in the west the sediment is large grained gravel which offers efficient groundwater discharge figs 2 and 8 4 3 groundwater discharge estimation 4 3 1 determination of 222rn endmember in groundwater to estimate the groundwater discharge flux into the xqd lake using the mass balance model equation 9 values of 222rn activity in lake water c w and groundwater c g w often called end numbers should be firstly determined the end member value of 222rn activity in groundwater may be estimated by three different methods 1 the 222rn activity of pore water near a continuous measurement point this method can only be used to estimate groundwater discharge at the point scale zhang et al 2015b 2 the 226ra 222rn equilibrium in sediment experiments involving pore water dimova et al 2013 and 3 the average value of 222rn in groundwater wells springs burnett et al 2013 the value of 222rn end member in groundwater obtained by the first method at the point scale is obviously not suitable for estimating groundwater discharge into large lake in this study the second method was not adopted because the 222rn concentration in some of the pore water samples e g p1 in fig 1a 222rn concentration 16086 bq m3 was more than that found at radioactive equilibrium 6596 bq m3 caused by either the heterogeneity of sediment or the effect of deeper groundwater with high 222rn concentration the 222rn concentration in groundwater ranged from 10 743 to 29980 bq m3 indicating slight heterogeneity of 222rn in groundwater this study employed the average 222rn concentration in groundwater and some pore water with low salinity 4 39 9 8 ppt that were located in the groundwater region shown in fig 5 as the 222rn end member in groundwater for 222rn mass balance model which was 13600 1197 bq m3 totally 10 groundwater and pore water samples 4 3 2 determination of 222rn endmember in lake water in xqd lake the 222rn activity in lake water ranged from 34 to 2056 bq m3 and the distribution of 222rn activity in the lake water samples was uneven thus use of the average 222rn activity of the samples as the lake water s end member value of 222rn activity in equation 9 will produce a large uncertainty in groundwater discharge estimation however few studies have discussed 222rn concentrations in lake water and most studies use the average 222rn concentration in lake water burnett et al 2013 dimova and burnett 2011 dimova et al 2013 luo et al 2016 figure 9 demonstrates that there is a positive correlation between lst and radon activity in surface lake water surface lake water lake water samples collected closely under the ice in this study thus we can infer the distribution of radon activity in surface lake water utilizing the lst values and this linear regression model log 222rn 0 25 lst 4 1 r2 0 63 p less than 0 01 and then the average radon activity in surface lake water was estimated in the arcgis version 10 2 to be 150 bq m3 in addition lake water s end member value for equation 9 also required a vertical average value but there is a lack of research on the mechanism of radon migration in shallow large lakes during the frozen period most studies have reported that the radon activity of surface lake water is higher than the vertical average value arnoux et al 2017 kluge et al 2007 this study estimated the vertical average value 75 bq m3 by multiplication by a conversion factor of 0 5 which was estimated based on the radon activity in the vertical profiles fig s3 4 3 3 the estimation of groundwater discharge into xqd lake during the frozen period the parameters used to estimate groundwater discharge flux into xqd lake are listed in table 2 using the 222rn mass balance model equation 9 the groundwater discharge flux was calculated to be 2 77 0 26 105 m3 d we measured the river discharge flux at summer 2019 09 in the tataling river near the lake which was 2 24 105 m3 d consequently the estimated groundwater discharge into xqd lake during the frozen period is slightly higher than river water input at summer groundwater discharge into xqd lake therefore plays an important role in the managements of water resources and lake s ecosystem to estimate groundwater discharge during the frozen period our study revealed that 222rn end member in lake water is an important variable and is difficult to determine however most of previous studies e g dimova et al 2013 and zhang et al 2015b focused on the determination of groundwater 222rn end member because it has considerable influences on the result of groundwater discharge estimation the 222rn end member in lake water was seldom paid attention the latest work by rodellas et al 2021 illustrated that relatively high conceptual uncertainty in groundwater discharge estimation could be caused by average 222rn concentration in surface water the determination of 222rn end member in lake water may be also important for the groundwater discharge estimation particularly for the ice covered lakes which have relatively weak hydrodynamic environment causing unevenly mixed lake water with large 222rn variation in lake water some methods e g location allocation model and inverse modeling techniques to obtain optimal average radium activity in surface water for radium mass balance model may also be suitable for 222rn methods kwon et al 2014 rapaglia et al 2012 however these methods require relatively large number of samples in surface water and it is difficult and involves considerable time and expense to collect surface water in some study areas such as ice covered lake in the present study and other remote regions the lst calculated based on remote sensing data that are available from the internet has a high precision wilson and rocha 2012 with the regression model between lst and 222rn in lake water the 222rn end member in lake water can be addressed effectively the regression model between lst and 222rn in lake water is statistical and can be built based on the spatial distributions of both temperature and radon that are dominated by groundwater discharge this regression model can be used in different forms such as the present study using the relationship between log 222rn in lake water and lst while cheng et al 2020 adopting the relationship between 222rn activity in surface water and temperature anomaly 5 conclusions research on groundwater discharge into ice covered lakes differs from research on groundwater discharge into ice free lakes for ice covered lakes ice melting must be considered this study identified the ice melting process using hydrogen and oxygen isotopes as well as measurement of salinity and chemical components excluding the noise associated with the measurement of ice melting process groundwater discharge was traced for an ice covered lake xqd lake in the tp this study used multiple types of evidence to trace groundwater discharge into xqd lake 1 the salinity and the concentrations of conservative elements na cl in the south and west of xqd lake were much lower than those in the eastern and northern parts of the lake 2 comparison of hydrogen and oxygen isotope levels showed that the lakeshore water in the south and west of xqd lake was affected by groundwater discharge 3 the 222rn activity in the south and west of xqd lake was much higher than that in the east and north of the lake 4 the lst variation was much smaller in the west than in the east and in the central area of xqd lake there was also a band shaped anomalous zone that showed small lst variation 5 the map of lst distribution in xqd lake during the icing period also indicated that groundwater discharge occurred in the west and south and in the area near springs the use of satellite remote sensing thermal images the map of lst variation and the map of lst distribution made up for the limited spatial distribution of the samples used in the determination of chemical components and isotope levels conversely the use of chemical component measurements and isotopic methods verified the results obtained by the remote sensing method in addition this study found that the map of lst distribution during the icing period is better for tracing groundwater discharge than the map of lst variation because the ice eliminated the noise created by wind and surface water input during the ice covered period collection of lake samples is difficult this study used the regression model between lst and 222rn activity in lake water to estimate the endmember of 222rn activity in lake water for the 222rn mass balance model using this model the groundwater discharge into xqd lake was roughly estimated to be 2 77 0 26 105 m3 d which is slightly higher than river water input at summer thus management strategies to address flooding and erosion associated with glacial melting and increased river flows into large ice covered lakes

3388,it has been known that groundwater lake water interaction plays an important role in mass exchange between land and lakes however most of the lakes in the world freeze during the winter and few studies of groundwater and surface water interaction groundwater discharge tracing focus on ice covered lakes this study investigated groundwater discharge into a large ice covered lake xiao qaidam lake in the tibetan plateau tp using satellite remote sensing and chemical and isotopic tracing analysis of chemical components stable isotopes d 18o and 222rn revealed that groundwater discharge occurred in the western and southern portions of xiao qaidam lake remote sensing data the distribution of and variation in lake surface temperature lst revealed these locations of groundwater discharge and indicated additional groundwater discharge in areas of springs based on the regression model between lst and 222rn activity in lake water and 222rn mass balance model the groundwater discharge into xiao qaidam lake was estimated to be 2 77 0 26 105 m3 d which is slightly higher than river water input at summer in addition this study also suggests that ice melting process should be considered when tracing groundwater discharge into an ice covered lake and that the lst distribution during the icing period is better than the lst variation for tracing groundwater discharge because

qaidam basin lv et al 2017 this lake emerged in the late pleistocene at an altitude of 3173 m during the study period it had an average depth of 2 6 m and a maximum depth of approximately 4 m and its area was approximately 100 km2 the xqd lake area experiences a continental arid climate with an average annual temperature of approximately 4 1960 2016 du et al 2016 the average annual evaporation is more than 2000 mm 1960 2016 the average annual precipitation is approximately 195 mm 1960 2016 and more than 80 of it occurs in may september to the northeast northwest and south of xqd lake are mountains composed of sinian metamorphic rocks and hills composed of tertiary mudstone and sandstone are found to the west fig 2 close to the lake quaternary diluvial sediments composed of sand and gravel occurred in the west and quaternary lacustrine and swamp sediments composed of clay and muddy silt are found to the east fig 2 around xqd lake there are quaternary unconsolidated sediments that contain some mirabilite lenses and gypsum crystals du et al 2016 the tataling river which originates from the qilian mountains flows into xqd lake from the northwest fig 1a the lower reaches of the tataling river usually dry up during the dry season and can only reach the lake during the wet season madsen et al 2014 qu 1981 the xqd lake is a terminal lake in the endorheic basin and has no outflow the groundwater around xqd lake flowing from mountains to the lake is an important water source for the towns surrounding the study area chen 2019 a dam composed of clay and gravel was built to deliver groundwater from the northwest to the east of the lake through pipes this dam also divided xqd lake into two parts and lake waters flow from the north water body into the south water body through two tunnels under the dam fig 1 the depth and width of one tunnel are 5 3 m and 17 2 m and the depth and width of the other are 3 6 m 15 0 m respectively due to continuous climate change that causes the increasing precipitation and glacial melt the area of xqd lake has expanded from approximately 40 km2 in the 1990s du et al 2016 to nearly 100 km2 in recent years seriously damaging residential buildings and threatening engineering facilities e g highways dams and well facilities around the lake fig 1 during the winter xqd lake is entirely covered by ice the water body north of the dam develops thick ice and is difficult to access to collect lake water samples therefore most of the lake samples in this study were collected from the south water body which is the main water body of xqd lake the analysis thus only addresses the south water body 2 2 field work and analytical methods 2 2 1 field work operation field work for this study was conducted from march 4 to march 9 2019 when xqd lake was ice covered a total of 55 water samples were collected including 7 groundwater samples 9 pore water samples 34 lake water samples and 5 ice samples in addition two bottom sediment samples 0 10 cm were collected one was taken from the west shore of xqd lake and the other was taken from the east shore groundwater samples were obtained from residential wells and springs for sampling in wells water was removed from the well bore by pumping for 5 min before groundwater was collected liao et al 2018 pore water was collected from a depth of 10 50 cm under the sediment using a pushing point sampler luo et al 2016 to sample the lake water under the ice we made a hole in the ice with an ice cutter the lake water was collected after removing the surface lake water containing floating ice to avoid the impact of ice melting ice samples collected from different depths were tested after the ice had melted the physical parameters of all water samples were measured in the field redox potential orp temperature t and ph were tested using a multi parameter device clean co and a salinity meter az instrument co was used to measure the salinity the process of water sample collection depended on the type of test that was to be conducted water samples to be used for measurement of cations ca k na mg were placed in 100 ml brown pre washed polyethylene bottles and then acidified with hno3 65 to adjust the ph to less than 2 samples for analysis of anions cl so4 hco3 co3 no3 and stable isotopes d and 18o were directly collected into 60 ml and 30 ml brown washed polyethylene bottles respectively when collecting water samples for radon analysis it is essential to avoid contact of the sample with air samples 250 ml of groundwater and pore water were carefully collected for the measurement of 222rn using the rad7 h2o durrdge co and 2 5 l samples of lake water and ice were collected for 222rn analysis using the rad7 big bottle system durrdge co luo et al 2018 the 222rn in ice were tested after the ice melted in the sealed 2 5 l glass bottle the uncertainty of discrete 222rn measurement in situ ranged from 10 to 25 in this study at 9 00 19 00 on march 7 2019 continuous 222rn monitoring was performed using a rad7 aqua durrdge co on the west side of xqd lake near the lcb point fig 1 a peristaltic pump was used to pump lake water from a depth of 0 5 m under the ice into the chamber of the rad7 aqua at a flow rate of 3 4 l min the 222rn activity was recorded every 10 min using the protocol of sniff luo et al 2018 the wind speed and air temperature were monitored at the same time the uncertainty of continuous 222rn measurement was approximately 50 60 this may be related to the use of a slow flow rate 2 2 2 chemical components measurement the major ions k na ca mg cl so4 hco3 no3 were measured in the key laboratory of crustal dynamics institute of crustal dynamics china earthquake administration using an ion chromatography system ics 2000 dionex co since the high salinity of the water in xqd lake reduces the precision and results in drift of the stable isotope d and 18o measurements luo et al 2017 this study used an automatic vacuum condensation extraction system lica united technology co ltd to remove salinity this system can condense and collect water vapor in a low temperature environment without isotopic fractionation a liquid water isotope analyzer lwia 24d at the isotope laboratory of china university of geosciences beijing was then used to measure the values of δd and δ18o with precisions of 0 3 and 0 1 respectively liao et al 2018 2 3 groundwater discharge tracing methods 2 3 1 satellite remote sensing data the use of satellite or airborne thermal remote sensing data to trace groundwater discharge into surface water is a novel approach that has been employed in recent years kelly et al 2019 lee et al 2016 mallast et al 2014 wilson and rocha 2012 for studies at large spatial scales landsat data are cost effective and can provide the spatially distributed surface temperature of water bodies lake surface temperature lst wilson and rocha 2012 the principle of using satellite remote sensing data to trace groundwater discharge into surface water is based on the difference between groundwater temperature and lst fig s1 kelly et al 2019 lee et al 2016 mallast et al 2014 wilson and rocha 2012 this difference is reflected in two aspects 1 the different temperature variation over a given period the temperature variation in groundwater is smaller than that in lake water since the latter is susceptible to changes in air temperature which varied significantly in both diurnal and seasonal scales wilson and rocha 2012 2 the different temperature value in northern latitudes surface water will be warmer than groundwater during the summer months and colder than groundwater during the winter months pluhowski 1972 tamborski et al 2015 in the use of landsat data to trace groundwater discharge the first principle depended on different temperature variation is usually applied mallast et al 2014 wilson and rocha 2012 in addition the method of using landsat data to retrieve the surface temperature of the water body has a high precision of approximately 1 2 k wilson and rocha 2012 wloczyk et al 2006 this high precision provides a foundation for tracing groundwater using landsat data a total of 13 satellite images obtained by landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli path 136 row 34 between january 2018 and march 2019 with cloud cover less than 30 were acquired from https earthexplorer usgs gov table s1 the images in february and march 2019 in which there were many clouds over xqd lake were excluded all data were projected to utm wgs 84 zone 46 n to determine the surface temperature of the lake lst it is first necessary to accurately extract the water features of xqd lake to avoid the influence of land temperature on the lst although many water indices including the normalized difference water index ndwi the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the water ratio index wri the automated water extraction index awei the normalized difference moisture index ndmi and the modified ndwi mndwi have been proposed for the extraction of water features acharya et al 2018 mcfeeters 1996 rokni et al 2014 xu 2006 rokni et al 2014 found that ndwi is the best water index for lakes hence this study employed the ndwi to extract the water features of xqd lake the ndwi can be expressed as 1 n d w i g r e e n n i r g r e e n n i r the land type around xqd lake is simple wetland and bare land figs 1 and 2 there is little environmental noise e g shadows built up areas snow around this lake thus the ndwi threshold with a value of 0 0 5 table s1 was determined based on land types from satellite images there are several steps in retrieving true lst using image processing software envi 5 1 in this study the raw space borne digital numbers dn which reflect converted thermal radiance at satellite or top of atmosphere toa radiance were reconverted to calibrate gain and bias the relevant equation chander et al 2009 mallast et al 2014 wilson and rocha 2012 is 2 l t o a m l d n a l where l t o a is the spectral radiance at the sensor w m 2 sr 1 μm 1 m l gain and a l bias or offset are the radiometric calibration coefficients in the image product header file w m 2 sr 1 μm 1 and dn is the digital number in each pixel of band 6 for landsat 7 etm and band 10 for landsat 8 oli the l t o a which includes downwelling radiance from the sky upwelling radiance from the atmosphere and radiance emitted from the earth s surface is not true surface radiance to remove these atmospheric effects in the thermal region a radiative transfer model atmospheric correction parameter calculator acpc was employed wilson and rocha 2012 this model which can be operated on the public web estimates the atmospheric transmission upwelling radiance and downwelling radiance based on the input of image acquisition date time and geographical locations barsi et al 2003 raj and fleming 2008 after integrating those values the surface radiances converted from the toa radiance can be used in the following equation mallast et al 2014 wilson and rocha 2012 3 l t l t o a l u τ 1 ε l d τ ε where l t is the surface radiance of an ideal black body w m 2 sr 1 μm 1 τ is atmospheric transmissivity ε is surface emissivity unitless and l u and l d are the upwelling radiance and the downwelling radiance respectively w m 2 sr 1 μm 1 the values of τ l u and l d estimated by acpc were present in table s1 as to the surface emissivity previous studies demonstrated that water emissivity generally varies from 0 97 to 0 99 over the wavelength range of 8 14 µm chander et al 2009 fei et al 2015 salisbury and d aria 1992 snyder et al 1998 and that for salt water use of the lower value of 0 97 is better mallast et al 2014 wen yao et al 1987 this study adopted a value of 0 97 as the water emissivity for all images finally the lst t s was calculated by planck s radiation law which employed two prelaunch calibration constants as follows 4 t s k 2 l n k 1 l t 1 273 15 where k 1 and k 2 are prelaunch thermal calibration constants equal to 666 09 w m 2 sr 1 μm 1 and 1282 71 k respectively mallast et al 2014 for landsat 7 data and 774 89 w m 2 sr 1 μm 1 and 1321 08 k respectively for landsat 8 data singh et al 2018 generally the error of t s estimated by landsat is approximately 1 4 k wloczyk et al 2006 as in previous studies this study employed the standard deviation sd to depict lst variation to distinguish temperature anomalies that could be used to trace groundwater discharge mallast et al 2014 wilson and rocha 2012 the sd can be expressed as 5 sd 1 n i 1 n t s i t s 2 where n is the number of images equal to 11 in this case t s i is the lst specific to each pixel in the ith image and t s is the average temperature specific to each pixel for all the images the s d lst variation in some regions can be much less than in the surrounding regions that shows an anomalous signal and offers the potential to trace groundwater discharge mallast et al 2014 wilson and rocha 2012 2 3 2 222rn tracer and its mass balance model the radon isotope 222rn which has a half life of 3 83 days is produced by 226ra and decays to 218po hoehn and von gunten 1989 radium containing minerals are common in aquifers and continuously produce radon which remains as a dissolved gas in groundwater until its decay in contrast radon in surface water e g rivers and lakes tends to decrease rapidly through loss by decay and diffusion into the atmosphere luo et al 2018 generally the level of radon in surface water is 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of radon in groundwater burnett et al 2007 the significant difference in radon activity between groundwater and surface water has been exploited to trace groundwater discharge into ponds rivers lakes and oceans cook et al 2018 corbett et al 1997 dimova and burnett 2011 gilfedder et al 2015 in addition the 222rn mass balance model has also been extensively used to estimate groundwater discharge flux burnett and dulaiova 2006 dimova and burnett 2011 gleeson et al 2009 zhang et al 2015b for the xqd lake the radon in lake water originates from groundwater input radium production and sediment diffusion and is lost by decay and atmospheric evasion the 222rn mass balance model can be expressed as 6 i r n t c g w j f d i f f c r a λ v f a t m c w v λ where i r n represents 222rn inventory in xqd lake body c w c g w and c r a are the 222rn activity in lake water and groundwater and the 226ra activity in lake water bq m3 respectively j is the groundwater discharge flux into xqd lake m3 d f d i f f and f a t m represent sediment diffusion and atmospheric evasion bq d respectively v is the volume of xqd lake during the frozen period λ is the decay constant of 222rn 0 186 d 1 and t is the time d recent studies demonstrated that most lakes cannot be treated as being in a steady state due to variable 222rn atmospheric evasion driven by wind induced turbulence dimova and burnett 2011 gilfedder et al 2015 xin luo et al 2018 however in the frozen period the 222rn in lake water was less affected by wind speed see below in addition the changes of lake water volume is limited during frozen period in the short time scale of 222rn method days to weeks liao et al 2018 and to some extent the adding loss of lake 222rn has little effect on the result of groundwater discharge estimation because of much higher 222rn concentration in groundwater than in lake water luo et al 2018 thus this study adopted a steady state 222rn mass balance model assuming that i r n t was equal to zero sediment diffusion f d i f f which occurs at the sediment water interface due to the significant difference in 222rn activity between lake water and pore water in sediment is an important source of 222rn in lake water the sediment diffusion flux can be estimated by the following equation cable et al 1996 xin luo et al 2016 martens et al 1980 7 f d i f f d s λ 0 5 c p c w a where a is the area of lakebed which approximates to the area of lake surface c p is the average 222rn activity of pore water in sediments bq m3 and can be obtained from the sediment equilibration experiments corbett et al 1998 d s is the 222rn molecular diffusion coefficient m d which can be described as follows boudreau 1996 dimova and burnett 2011 schulz 2006 8 d s 10 980 t 1 59 1 ln n 2 2 where t is the lake water temperature k and n is the sediment porosity unitless for ice free lakes atmospheric evasion depending upon wind speed and temperature is one of the dominant sinks liao et al 2018 luo et al 2016 schubert et al 2012 however recent studies have revealed that atmospheric evasion is much lower during the frozen period since the ice blocks the exchange between lake water and air arnoux et al 2017 loose et al 2017 this study conducted continuous 222rn monitoring of lake water in the ice covered lake and found that the level of 222rn in frozen lake water was not related to wind speed or temperature and remained stable during the monitoring fig 3 thus atmospheric evasion which is important to consider when evaluating ice free lakes was neglected for ice covered lakes combining equations 6 7 and 8 the groundwater discharge flux can be expressed as 9 j c w c ra v λ 10 980 t 1 59 1 ln n 2 2 λ 0 5 c p c w a c gw 3 results 3 1 geochemical features all waters sampled lake water pore water and groundwater were alkaline ph generally ranging from 8 to 9 the orp varied more for lake water than for groundwater and pore water with a range of 298 mv to 210 mv for lake water 99 mv to 156 mv for groundwater and 46 mv to 176 mv for pore water groundwater salinity 0 18 0 83 ppt was much less than salinity of lake water 12 5 40 09 ppt and the salinity in pore water varied between these two extremes ranging from 4 39 ppt to 30 6 ppt table 1 except for ca and no3 the concentrations of major ion components were much higher in lake water than in the other waters sampled ice pore water and groundwater such as cl which was approximately two orders of magnitude higher in lake water than in groundwater table 1 while the average ca concentration in pore water 497 15 mg l was approximately twice that in lake water 191 23 mg l and no3 was slightly higher in pore water 11 48 mg l than in lake water 8 89 mg l high no3 in pore water may originate from animal husbandry around the xqd lake the radon activity in lake water varied over two orders of magnitude from 34 bq m3 to 2056 bq m3 but it was still far lower than that in pore water and groundwater the average radon activity in lake water was an order of magnitude smaller than that in pore water and was 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that in groundwater table 1 lake water close to land is likely to retain the characteristics of groundwater roy 2019 here we used lake water within 50 m of the shore of xqd lake to trace groundwater discharge fig 4 the conservative elements k na cl showed the same distribution highly concentrated in the north and east the distribution of so4 and mg was similar high ca concentrations were found at l4 and l13 in the west and south of xqd lake the distribution of no3 presented no such spatial variation salinity in the western and southern parts of xqd lake was lower than that in the east and north the distribution of 222rn in lake water was mostly opposite to that of salinity k na and cl 222rn activity is higher in the western and southern than that in the eastern and northern parts of xqd lake fig 4 3 2 stable isotopes the stable isotopes δd δ18o in various water bodies showed a generally depletion trend in the following order ice lake water pore water and groundwater table 1 as shown in fig 5 the δd and δ18o of groundwater were distributed near the global meteoric water line gmwl indicating limited post depositional isotopic modification from precipitation zhao et al 2018 the trend of the lake water was at an angle with the gmwl with a slope of 5 53 black dotted line in fig 5 indicating that the lake water had undergone relatively marked evaporation birks et al 2017 the ice samples were at the end of the evaporation trend line consistent with the enrichment of heavy isotopes in the ice formed from the lake water toyota et al 2013 the pore water in xqd lake was divided into two regions one in the groundwater region and the other near the lake water region 3 3 remote sensing data the lst of xqd lake measured each month during 2018 is shown in fig 6 since 2003 the landsat 7 etm airborne scan line corrector slc has malfunctioned resulting in missing data bands in the acquired image the images obtained in april september and november were landsat 7 data and showed many bands indicating that data from these regions were missing this study adopted inverse distance weight interpolation to compensate for these missing data xqd lake had high lst in july and august and low lst in january and december fig 6 sd in fig 7 a represents the lst variation calculated by lst distribution in each month except june of 2018 because the area of lst distribution is different in each month fig 6 and the minimum area of lst distribution in may dominates the area of lst variation map the area of the lst variation map was smaller than the area of xqd lake when ice covered in december see fig 7a at the two tunnel outlets below the dam the lst variation was anomalous showing a smaller lst variation than the surroundings fig 7b illustrates the lake freezing process during november the water area the area with higher temperature than the ice area in fig 7b is similar to the middle area with a small lst variation fig 7a 4 discussion 4 1 ice melting process for ice free lakes the factors that affect solute concentrations in lake water are river water input groundwater input evaporation temperature variation redox environment and acid base environment luo et al 2018 in winter lake water is isolated by surface ice thus the evaporation of ice covered lake water can be ignored solutes in saline lake water are much higher than that in groundwater the temperature variation of lake water in this study thus has limited effect on the solutes concentrations the redox environment only affects the active elements e g fe mn as etc and has little effect on the conservative solutes we employed as tracers in this study variations in ph were negligible and thus can also be ignored table 1 during the winter river water is frozen thus the river water input to xqd lake is negligible and groundwater input assumes greater significance for solutes in ice covered lakes ice melting process must also be considered for a lake covered by ice the impact of ice melting on the solutes present in the lake water cannot be avoided especially in the case of lakeshore water that is covered by thin ice even if the sampling is conducted very carefully lake water mixed with the water produced by ice melting is inevitably collected for two reasons 1 at night the air temperature decreased leading to freezing while during the daytime when fieldwork was conducted the air temperature increased resulting in ice melting ashton 1980 2 discharge of groundwater at a temperature above freezing could melt ice at the groundwater lake water interface the solute content of ice water is usually low therefore if ice melting is not excluded the salinity conductivity previous studies e g harvey et al 1997 applied to trace groundwater discharge into salt lakes and oceans is unsuitable for a frozen lake in fig 4 the lower na cl concentrations and salinity at the west and south of xqd lake may indicate groundwater discharge or may have been affected by ice melting see section 4 2 ice has relatively heavy stable isotope values due to strong fractionation toyota et al 2013 while groundwater possesses light stable isotope values fig 5 the significant difference in stable isotope values between ice and groundwater can be used to identify groundwater discharge and monitor the ice melting process the shore lake water at l14 and lx4 located at the south and west of xqd lake respectively had low salinity fig 4a but the levels of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water located at the ice region shown in fig 5 are higher than those in other lake water consequently it can be inferred that l14 and lx4 were the main areas affected by the ice melting process in addition the 222rn concentration is much higher in groundwater than in ice table 1 thus the lake water dominated by ice melting would have a low 222rn concentration such as l14 fig 4b 4 2 groundwater discharge tracing 4 2 1 chemical components stable isotopes and 222rn after long term evaporation solutes become concentrated the salinity of the salt lake e g xqd lake is therefore much higher than that of groundwater hence measurement of salinity and the levels of conservative elements can be used to identify groundwater discharge bussmann and suess 1998 luo et al 2016 excluding the lake water l14 and lx4 affected by the ice melting process the much lower salinity na and cl concentrations observed in the south and west of xqd lake compared to that in the eastern and northern lake regions indicated that groundwater discharge may occur in these regions at l4 in the west and l13 in the south the 222rn concentration in lake water is much higher than that in other lake water samples fig 4b it indicated that groundwater discharge occurred in those locations in some areas where groundwater discharge may have occurred eg near l8 the no3 level in the lake water was relatively high fig 4a and h the groundwater borne nitrate may threaten the lake s ecological system kong et al 2019 liao et al 2018 the stable isotope compositions of pore water samples shown in fig 5 could be divided into two groups one which has the same characteristics as groundwater was located in the groundwater area and the other was close to the lake water area implying that the latter group of pore waters was dominated by lake water the domination of pore waters by lake water may be caused by either the variable density flow that lake water with higher density than groundwater moved downward from the lake bed cooper 1959 simmons et al 1999 wooding 2007 zhang et al 2020 or lake water have somewhat entered the sampling instrument when we collected pore water nevertheless fig 5 shows that some of the lake water samples were located between two pore water regions indicating that these lake water samples were affected by groundwater discharge in fact the lake water samples that were located between two pore water regions eg samples l4 c1 and l8 were also inferred to be groundwater dominated based on their salinity levels and on the concentration of conservative elements described above fig 4a 222rn is an effective tracer to locate groundwater discharge chanyotha et al 2014 xu et al 2014 relatively high 222rn concentration in the lake water samples between two pore water regions also supported that these lake samples were groundwater dominated 4 2 2 lake surface temperature lst tracing groundwater discharge through direct measurement and water sampling i e chemical components and isotopes can only indicate that there is groundwater discharge at the point scale kalbus et al 2006 the precision of results extrapolated from point to region depends upon the interval of measurement or sampling higher precision which requires more samples and is more costly is difficult to achieve in the frozen area however calculation of lake surface temperature using remote sensing data is a cost effective method of tracing groundwater discharge at the regional scale mallast and siebert 2019 in xqd lake the lst variation i e sd in fig 7a was much smaller in the west than in the east indicating that groundwater discharge may occur in the west this conclusion is consistent with that inferred based on the concentrations of chemical components salinity na cl and isotopes d and 18o and 222rn in the central area of xqd lake which is not the deepest area of the lake there was a band shaped anomalous zone with a small lst variation fig 7a this area corresponds to the area that freezes last during the icing process fig 7b it was speculated that groundwater discharge may also occur in this area groundwater discharge made the overlying lake warmer and caused the area to freeze later since the lst variation map was depended upon the smallest area of lst distribution image among all used images the image in may in this study see section 3 3 the lst variation map would miss some areas compared to lst distributions in some months e g december in this study fig 7a thus groundwater discharge information for some areas is missing the temperature gap between groundwater and lake water reaches a maximum during the winter period approximately 10 fig s1 if groundwater with higher temperature is discharged into the lake the temperature of the lake water will increase fig 8 shows the lst distribution in xqd lake during the frozen period december 2018 it can be found that the lake water areas with relatively high temperatures correspond to the areas that show low lst variation small sd in fig 7a furthermore the map of lst distribution in xqd lake during the icing period can trace the groundwater discharge areas that the lst variation map did not identify such as the abnormally high temperature zone near the north of xqd lake in the remote sensing image obtained during the ice free period numerous groundwater springs could be identified within the lake fig 8 and the distribution of these springs was similar to that of the high temperature zone the lst distribution during the frozen period also showed higher temperatures in the west and south of xqd lake than in the north and east similar to the conclusion presented in section 4 2 1 mapping of lst distribution appears to be an ideal tool for tracing groundwater discharge during the frozen period however in other seasons the map of lst distribution calculated by remote sensing data cannot be used to identify groundwater discharge fig s2 previous studies also have rarely used maps of lst distribution in a single season to trace groundwater discharge the main reasons that tracing groundwater discharge based on the map of lst distribution is effective only during the period in which the lake is frozen may be 1 in the ice free period the heterogeneity of wind speed and water flow on the lake surface has an impact on the lst mallast et al 2014 making it impossible to identify the changes in lst caused by groundwater discharge while during the ice covered period the flat ice layer causes the air effect on lst to be uniform 2 the temperature difference between groundwater and lake water is large enough during the frozen period fig s1 that the effect of groundwater on lst is significant 3 in the ice free period input from river water or surface runoff will affect lst in a manner similar to groundwater mallast et al 2014 while during the frozen period most river waters are frozen and do not flow into the lake this part of the study found that based on chemical and isotopic compositions and the distribution map of lst groundwater discharge was obviously more significant in the west of xqd lake than in the east the occurrence of groundwater discharge may be related to the types of sediments present in xqd lake the sediment in the east is small grained clay while in the west the sediment is large grained gravel which offers efficient groundwater discharge figs 2 and 8 4 3 groundwater discharge estimation 4 3 1 determination of 222rn endmember in groundwater to estimate the groundwater discharge flux into the xqd lake using the mass balance model equation 9 values of 222rn activity in lake water c w and groundwater c g w often called end numbers should be firstly determined the end member value of 222rn activity in groundwater may be estimated by three different methods 1 the 222rn activity of pore water near a continuous measurement point this method can only be used to estimate groundwater discharge at the point scale zhang et al 2015b 2 the 226ra 222rn equilibrium in sediment experiments involving pore water dimova et al 2013 and 3 the average value of 222rn in groundwater wells springs burnett et al 2013 the value of 222rn end member in groundwater obtained by the first method at the point scale is obviously not suitable for estimating groundwater discharge into large lake in this study the second method was not adopted because the 222rn concentration in some of the pore water samples e g p1 in fig 1a 222rn concentration 16086 bq m3 was more than that found at radioactive equilibrium 6596 bq m3 caused by either the heterogeneity of sediment or the effect of deeper groundwater with high 222rn concentration the 222rn concentration in groundwater ranged from 10 743 to 29980 bq m3 indicating slight heterogeneity of 222rn in groundwater this study employed the average 222rn concentration in groundwater and some pore water with low salinity 4 39 9 8 ppt that were located in the groundwater region shown in fig 5 as the 222rn end member in groundwater for 222rn mass balance model which was 13600 1197 bq m3 totally 10 groundwater and pore water samples 4 3 2 determination of 222rn endmember in lake water in xqd lake the 222rn activity in lake water ranged from 34 to 2056 bq m3 and the distribution of 222rn activity in the lake water samples was uneven thus use of the average 222rn activity of the samples as the lake water s end member value of 222rn activity in equation 9 will produce a large uncertainty in groundwater discharge estimation however few studies have discussed 222rn concentrations in lake water and most studies use the average 222rn concentration in lake water burnett et al 2013 dimova and burnett 2011 dimova et al 2013 luo et al 2016 figure 9 demonstrates that there is a positive correlation between lst and radon activity in surface lake water surface lake water lake water samples collected closely under the ice in this study thus we can infer the distribution of radon activity in surface lake water utilizing the lst values and this linear regression model log 222rn 0 25 lst 4 1 r2 0 63 p less than 0 01 and then the average radon activity in surface lake water was estimated in the arcgis version 10 2 to be 150 bq m3 in addition lake water s end member value for equation 9 also required a vertical average value but there is a lack of research on the mechanism of radon migration in shallow large lakes during the frozen period most studies have reported that the radon activity of surface lake water is higher than the vertical average value arnoux et al 2017 kluge et al 2007 this study estimated the vertical average value 75 bq m3 by multiplication by a conversion factor of 0 5 which was estimated based on the radon activity in the vertical profiles fig s3 4 3 3 the estimation of groundwater discharge into xqd lake during the frozen period the parameters used to estimate groundwater discharge flux into xqd lake are listed in table 2 using the 222rn mass balance model equation 9 the groundwater discharge flux was calculated to be 2 77 0 26 105 m3 d we measured the river discharge flux at summer 2019 09 in the tataling river near the lake which was 2 24 105 m3 d consequently the estimated groundwater discharge into xqd lake during the frozen period is slightly higher than river water input at summer groundwater discharge into xqd lake therefore plays an important role in the managements of water resources and lake s ecosystem to estimate groundwater discharge during the frozen period our study revealed that 222rn end member in lake water is an important variable and is difficult to determine however most of previous studies e g dimova et al 2013 and zhang et al 2015b focused on the determination of groundwater 222rn end member because it has considerable influences on the result of groundwater discharge estimation the 222rn end member in lake water was seldom paid attention the latest work by rodellas et al 2021 illustrated that relatively high conceptual uncertainty in groundwater discharge estimation could be caused by average 222rn concentration in surface water the determination of 222rn end member in lake water may be also important for the groundwater discharge estimation particularly for the ice covered lakes which have relatively weak hydrodynamic environment causing unevenly mixed lake water with large 222rn variation in lake water some methods e g location allocation model and inverse modeling techniques to obtain optimal average radium activity in surface water for radium mass balance model may also be suitable for 222rn methods kwon et al 2014 rapaglia et al 2012 however these methods require relatively large number of samples in surface water and it is difficult and involves considerable time and expense to collect surface water in some study areas such as ice covered lake in the present study and other remote regions the lst calculated based on remote sensing data that are available from the internet has a high precision wilson and rocha 2012 with the regression model between lst and 222rn in lake water the 222rn end member in lake water can be addressed effectively the regression model between lst and 222rn in lake water is statistical and can be built based on the spatial distributions of both temperature and radon that are dominated by groundwater discharge this regression model can be used in different forms such as the present study using the relationship between log 222rn in lake water and lst while cheng et al 2020 adopting the relationship between 222rn activity in surface water and temperature anomaly 5 conclusions research on groundwater discharge into ice covered lakes differs from research on groundwater discharge into ice free lakes for ice covered lakes ice melting must be considered this study identified the ice melting process using hydrogen and oxygen isotopes as well as measurement of salinity and chemical components excluding the noise associated with the measurement of ice melting process groundwater discharge was traced for an ice covered lake xqd lake in the tp this study used multiple types of evidence to trace groundwater discharge into xqd lake 1 the salinity and the concentrations of conservative elements na cl in the south and west of xqd lake were much lower than those in the eastern and northern parts of the lake 2 comparison of hydrogen and oxygen isotope levels showed that the lakeshore water in the south and west of xqd lake was affected by groundwater discharge 3 the 222rn activity in the south and west of xqd lake was much higher than that in the east and north of the lake 4 the lst variation was much smaller in the west than in the east and in the central area of xqd lake there was also a band shaped anomalous zone that showed small lst variation 5 the map of lst distribution in xqd lake during the icing period also indicated that groundwater discharge occurred in the west and south and in the area near springs the use of satellite remote sensing thermal images the map of lst variation and the map of lst distribution made up for the limited spatial distribution of the samples used in the determination of chemical components and isotope levels conversely the use of chemical component measurements and isotopic methods verified the results obtained by the remote sensing method in addition this study found that the map of lst distribution during the icing period is better for tracing groundwater discharge than the map of lst variation because the ice eliminated the noise created by wind and surface water input during the ice covered period collection of lake samples is difficult this study used the regression model between lst and 222rn activity in lake water to estimate the endmember of 222rn activity in lake water for the 222rn mass balance model using this model the groundwater discharge into xqd lake was roughly estimated to be 2 77 0 26 105 m3 d which is slightly higher than river water input at summer thus management strategies to address flooding and erosion associated with glacial melting and increased river flows into large ice covered lakes should also consider groundwater discharge credit authorship contribution statement fu liao investigation methodology writing original draft guangcai wang conceptualization writing original draft

of porous media mostafaei et al 2020 xie et al 2019 zhao and zhao 2020 however the coupling cfd dem needs to solve the navier stokes equation which spends a high computational cost therefore it is usually restricted in its application to single particles or systems with a limited number of particles kruggel emden et al 2016 the lattice boltzmann method mcnamara and zanetti 1988 is a mesoscopic simulation method which has great advantages over the traditional method in the treatment of complex boundary conditions in porous media of complex geometry succi et al 1989 utilized the lbm to simulate single phase flow in three dimensional random media and confirmed darcy s law adrover and giona 1996 simulated the seepage problem of two dimensional random media by the lbm and studied the

pore space heterogeneity on mineral dissolution and permeability evolution in porous media by the lbm yang et al 2021 used ct image and brinkman force lattice boltzmann model to ternary segmentation and estimation of permeability for porous rocks it is found that most scholars use the random generation method to establish the structural model of porous media in which the particle size and porosity are difficult to control in addition the validaty of the numerical study from literatures requires futher exploration through experimental investigation in this paper the discrete element method is used to establish the physical model of porous media with certain porosity and particle size the fluid flow through porous media with a 2d packing system is simulated by using the lattice boltzmann method and the influencing factors on the permeability are studied the paper is structured as follows firstly the numerical method is verified by the fluid flow through parallel chancel through the comparison with the theoretical solution then the effects of resolution and representative element volume rev are studied to obtain reliable and accurate results after that the effects of particle size and porosity on permeability are systematically studied and the modified k c equation is proposed finally the constant head test is carried out on the glass beads to verify the accuracy of the proposed model 2 methodology 2 1 lattice boltzmann method lbm the lattice boltzmann method lbm is the discrete form of the boltzmann bgk equation bhatnagar et al 1954 it is generally composed of an evolution equation of distribution function discrete velocity model an equilibrium distribution function qian et al 1992 proposed the ddqm model d represents the number of dimensions and m represents the number of discrete velocities and the d2q9 model is one of the most widely used models in the lattice boltzmann method in this paper the incompressible lbgk model is used in which the evolution equation of the density distribution function is defined as 1 f i x c e i δ x t δ t f i x t ω i f i x t where c δ x δ t δ x and δ t are the lattice grid spacing and time step respectively e i is the discrete velocity direction and can be expressed as eq 2 and ω i f i x t is the collision operator and can be acquired by eq 3 2 e i 0 0 c c o s i 1 π 2 s i n i 1 π 2 2 c c o s 2 i 1 π 4 s i n 2 i 1 π 4 i 0 i 1 3 5 7 i 2 4 6 8 3 ω i 1 τ f i f i eq where τ is the relaxation time and f i eq is the equilibrium distribution function given by 4 f i eq ρ ω i 1 e i u c s 2 e i u 2 2 c s 4 u 2 2 c s 2 where ω i is the weight factor expressed as 5 ω i 4 9 i 0 1 9 i 1 3 5 7 1 36 i 2 4 6 8 the macroscopic density and velocity can be obtained as 6 ρ i 1 m f i 7 ρ u i 1 m f i e i accordingly the incompressible navier stokes equations can be derived through multi scaling expansion as 8 u 0 9 u t uu p ν 2 u where p c s 2 ρ is the pressure and ν is the kinetic viscosity given by 10 ν 2 τ 1 c 2 δ t 6 2 2 verification of the lbm the poiseuille flow with the theoretical solution is used to verify the accuracy of lbm the calculation model is a 6 mm 6 mm square with a resolution of 50 the calculation formula of the vertical distribution of poiseuille flow velocity is as follows 11 u y j 2 μ h 2 4 y 2 where u y is the velocity at any point in the direction j is the hydraulic gradient h is the pipe width and μ is the fluid viscosity the velocity distribution in the parallel plate model is obtained by the lbm and the maximum velocity is at the center of the channel fig 1 a the simulation results of the velocity at each point of the middle section of the parallel plate are compared with the theoretical results fig 1b after calculation the error between the simulation results and the theoretical results is 1 26 which meets the requirements of the test error and proves the accuracy of the lbm program in this paper 3 numerical simulation of fluid flow through porous media 3 1 generation of porous media and the boundary conditions the discrete element method is used to generate the 2d porous media by specifying the generation range and porosity in this paper the radius expansion method is used to generate the porous media to ensure that the particles are evenly distributed in the simulation region firstly porous media with target porosity are randomly generated in the specified range fig 2 a and then the radius is enlarged according to the specified amplification factor e g 1 3 fig 2b finally the radius decreased to the normal value so the generated model is the same with the target porosity and particles sizes fig 2c the boundary conditions in the simulation are set as follows the upper and lower walls as well as the solid particles adopt the standard bounce back scheme the left boundary adopts the nonequilibrium bounce back scheme and the right boundary adopts the fully developed scheme khajepor et al 2019 zou and he 1997 3 2 effect of resolution in the lbm the resolution affects the efficiency and accuracy of the results to ensure the accuracy of calculation the minimum resolution of the simulation was firstly determined as suggested by hager et al 2014 the size of the grid is required to be at least 1 10 1 8 of the particle diameter to this end the particle size of the porous media sample is 1 mm the porosity is 0 5 and the generated area is a 10 mm 10 mm square the model is imported to the lbm for calculation under the same boundary conditions and pressure gradient the permeability of porous media samples with different resolutions is simulated the simulation result is presented in fig 3 the permeability of porous media increases gradually with the improvement of resolution and comes to a steady state when the resolution approaches 50 therefore the resolution is set to 50 for subsequent simulation in this paper 3 3 effect of representative elementary volume rev the representative elementary volume rev is proposed by bear 1972 in the seepage analysis of soil and the permeability of rev can be used to represent the permeability of the soil a reasonable calculation size can avoid wasting computing resources in the simulation process to this end the random porous media with the size of 20 mm 20 mm is firstly generated the particle size is set as 1 mm and the porosity is 0 5 then the representative elementary volume is extracted from the generated model with sizes changing from 2 mm to 13 mm the revs with different sizes are imported to the lbm for calculation fig 4 a the permeability of porous media comes to a steady state as the size increases fig 4b it is found that when the size of rev is greater than 10 times of particle size the permeability fluctuates around 11 3 10 4 mm2 therefore the size of rev in the following seepage simulation of porous media is 10 times the minimum particle size 3 4 simulation of fluid flow through porous media with uniform particle size to study the effect of porosity on seepage characteristics of porous media the particle size is set as a fixed value of 1 mm the porous media models with different porosity are generated and the simulation result from lbm is shown in fig 5 it can be seen that when the porosity is small the number of seepage channels increases rapidly with the increase of the porosity and the number of seepage channels is the major factor that affects the permeability however when the porosity is slightly larger the number of seepage channels does not increase with the increase of the porosity at this time the average size of pore throat is the major factor affecting the permeability the correlation between permeability and porosity is summarized in fig 6 3 5 simulation of fluid flow through porous media with different particle sizes the effect of particle size on the seepage characteristics of porous media is studied and the fixed porosity is set to 0 4 and particle size is changing from 0 2 mm to 1 6 mm it can be found that the number of pore channels decreases and the channel size increases with the increase of particle size and the permeability increases with the particle size as shown in fig 7 3 6 analysis of numerical simulation results of uniform particle size in 1972 bear 1972 proposed the general expression of permeability 12 k f 1 s f 2 n d 2 where f 1 s is the correlation function of particle shape f 2 n is the correlation function of porosity d is the particle size in eq 12 the particle size d is not specified and a more general expression is proposed in this paper 13 k f 1 s f 2 n f 3 d m where dm is the representative particle size such as d10 hazen 1911 terzaghi 1925 d20 china institute of water resources and hydropower 1982 in fig 6 there is an obvious positive correlation between permeability and porosity therefore the seepage simulation results of porous media with uniform particle size are analyzed by the linear fitting method fig 8 there is an extremely high correlation between porosity function n3 1 n 2 and permeability and the correlation coefficient is 0 99 therefore the correlation function of porosity f 2 n is expressed as 14 f 2 n n 3 1 n 2 in addition to study the correlation between representative particle size and permeability eq 15 is used for analysis in this paper 15 k a d m a a d a take logarithm on both sides of eq 15 to get eq 16 16 lg k lg a a lg d with lgk as the abscissa and lgdm as the ordinate the scatter diagram is drawn and fitted fig 9 there is a high linear correlation between lgk and lgdm and the correlation coefficient is 0 99 the slope of the fitting curve a 1 92 is close to 2 hence the correlation function of the representative particle size can be expressed as 17 f 3 d m d m 2 according to the classical k c equation 18 k 1 s 0 2 c k c e 3 1 e where s 0 is the specific surface area given by 19 s 0 4 3 π d 2 3 4 π d 2 2 6 d therefore for porous media with uniform particle size 20 k d 2 1 s 0 2 by dimensional transformation of eq 13 the classical k c equation eq 18 can be transformed into 21 k 1 c k 1 s 0 2 n 3 1 n 2 3 7 simulation of fluid flow in porous media with uniform particle size interval in order to simulate porous media with uniform particle size interval uniform samples with particle size intervals of 0 5 0 5 mm 0 5 1 0 mm 0 5 1 5 mm 0 5 2 mm 0 5 2 5 mm and 0 5 3 mm are generated respectively for each particle size interval the former value is the minimum particle size and the latter one is the maximum particle size and the particle are uniformly generated within this range each particle size interval corresponded to different porosity 0 30 0 60 and 42 test conditions are conducted according to the simulation results of porous media seepage with uniform particle size interval the ck values in the k c equation are inversely calculated fig 10 it can be seen that the ck values are not constant in the same particle size interval the ck value decreases with the increase of the porosity and gradually tend to a stable value which is essentially between 4 8 5 3 carrier iii 2003 when the porosity is between 0 3 0 4 the the ck value decreases dramaticallly however when the porosity is greater than 0 4 the decline rate of the ck value slows down in fig 10 it is obvious that porosity is the main factor affecting the ck value and there is a logarithmic relationship between porosity and 1 ck so logarithmic fitting is adopted fig 11 to make the fitting results more meaningful the 1 ck takes the average value under the same porosity 0 3 0 5 according to the results of the fitting 22 1 c k a b l n n in the eq 22 a 0 391 b 0 269 at this time the k c equation is expressed as 23 k 0 391 0 269 l n n 1 s 0 2 n 3 1 n 2 eq 23 is a modification of the k c equation for porous media with uniform particle size intervals 3 8 simulation of fluid flow in porous media with mixed particle size to study the permeability characteristics of porous media with mixed particle size the generation area of the mixed particle size model is 25 mm 25 mm square and the porosity is 0 4 then two groups of porous media particle size intervals of 0 5 1 5 mm and 1 5 2 5 mm respectively are generated in this area porous media with different gradations are generated by controlling the relative content of the two groups of particle size intervals and 11 test conditions are conducted which are listed in table 1 the scatter diagram is drawn with the percentage content of particle size interval of 0 5 1 5 mm as the abscissa and the 1 ck as the ordinate fig 12 with the same porosity 1 ck changes with the relative percentage of mixed particle size in the case of uniform particle size interval the percentage content of 0 5 1 5 mm is 0 or 100 the development degree of the pore channel is good and 1 ck is large in the case of mixed particle size 0 the percentage content of 0 5 1 5 mm 100 due to the filling effect of fine particles on the pore channel of coarse particles the pore channel is narrow and the 1 ck is small the coefficient of uniformity cu is the quantity to measure the non uniformity of soil in fig 13 1 ck decreases with the increase of cu because of the enhancement of particle filling effect and the insufficient development of pore channel in the 11 test conditions of mixed particle size simulated in this paper the maximum deviation is 10 which can be accepted in engineering therefore the modification of the k c equation eq 23 based on uniform particle size interval is also applicable in mixed particle size 4 experimental study and verification 4 1 material the glass beads are used as porous media to obtain permeability with different porosity and particle size the custom glass beads are used for the test it can effectively reduce the influence of the shape parameters of porous media on permeability five glass beads with different particle sizes are used in the test including 0 6 0 8 mm 0 8 1 2 mm 1 2 1 5 mm 1 5 2 mm and 2 3 mm fig 14 in addition to reduce the error caused by gas in the sample distilled water is used to saturate the sample 4 2 test equipment the existing tst 70 type constant head permeameter has many problems in use such as loading samples evenly is difficult porosity is difficult to control etc these problems will engender large errors in the test to solve the above problems a set of instruments made of polymethyl methacrylate pmma is studied in this paper fig 15 the permeameter is mainly composed of two parts the seepage occurred part and the constant head control part two parts are connected by threads and the inner diameter is 5 cm which meets the requirements of the specification of soil test sl237 1999 so it can be used to determine the permeability of porous media samples with particle sizes less than 5 mm 4 3 test conditions 1 laboratory tests with uniform particle size interval constant head tests are carried out on the 5 glass bead samples with different particle size intervals including 0 6 0 8 mm 0 8 1 2 mm 1 2 1 5 mm 1 5 2 mm and 2 3 mm during the test by controlling the dry density method the porous media under each particle interval are compacted to different porosity including 25 groups of tests 2 laboratory tests with mixed particle size the glass beads are compacted with five particle size intervals and the total number of 15 particle size distributions is generated as listed in table 2 4 4 verification of the prediction formula with uniform particle size interval constant head tests are carried out on the glass beads with self designed water head instruments and according to the test results to verify the prediction model of the permeability proposed in the above section eq 23 it is found that the relative error of the modified k c equation is much smaller than that of the classical k c equation compared with the experimental results fig 16 4 5 verification of the prediction formula with mixed particle size according to the results of constant head tests the applicability of the permeability prediction is verified for mixed particle size the predicted value of the classical k c equation is 2 09 2 73 of the test results while the ratio of the predicted value of the modified k c equation to the test results is close to 1 based on the results in table 3 which shows the validity of the modified k c equation 5 conclusion remarks in this study the permeability of porous media is studied by using the combination of lbm and dem meanwhile the constant head test is carried out on glass beads with different porosity and particle size distribution based on the results from numerical simulation and experiments the following conclusion can be drawn 1 based on the numerical simulation the linear correlations between n 3 1 n 2 d 2 and permeability are established the physical constant ck is found closely related to the porosity with 1 ck a bln n based on which the modified k c equation is established 2 according to the experimental results of fluid flow in glass beads with uniform particle sizes the relative error of the modified k c equation 7 77 18 55 is much smaller than the classical k c equation 37 66 52 86 3 from the test results of fluid flow through glass beads with mixed particle sizes the ratio between the predicted permeability of the classical k c equation and the experimental results is 2 09 2 73 whereas the ratio is close to 1 for the modified k c equation 4 compared with the classical k c equation the modified k c equation is more accurate which is applicable for both uniform and non uniform particles

empirical constant in the k c equation nabovati and sousa 2007 used the lbm to simulate fluid flow in two dimensional random porous media and studied the effect of tortuosity on permeability cui et al 2012 conducted a two dimensional simulation using lbm dem to study the behavior of a soil bed under the action of locally injected fluid chen et al 2015 studied pore size distribution porosity and specific surface area in shale gas transportation mechanism by using a combining method of scanning electron microscopy with the lbm khabbazi et al 2016 used lattice boltzmann model lbm to determine the impact of particle aspect ratio on the intrinsic tortuosity porosity relationships of two dimensional porous media composed of rectangular particles eshghinejadfard et al 2016 simulated the 3d laminar flow in porous media by the lbm and calculated the permeability under face centered cubic fcc and body centered cubic bcc respectively hu et al 2019 quantified the impact of different image characteristics on the seepage related property of silty clay through 2d lattice boltzmann method flow simulation zhao et al 2020 developed an improved pore network model considering cross sections of the real throat to simulate two phase drainage flow in porous media and used the lbm to calculate the two phase flow properties in these real throat bonds zhang et al 2022 studied the influence of pore space heterogeneity on mineral dissolution and permeability evolution in porous media by the lbm yang et al 2021 used ct image and brinkman force lattice boltzmann model to ternary segmentation and estimation of permeability for porous rocks it is found that most scholars use the random generation method to establish the structural model of porous media in which the particle size and porosity are difficult to control in addition the validaty of the numerical study from literatures requires futher exploration through experimental investigation in this paper the discrete element method is used to establish the physical model of porous media with certain porosity and particle size the fluid flow through porous media with a 2d packing system is simulated by using the lattice boltzmann method and the influencing factors on the permeability are studied the paper is structured as follows firstly the numerical method is verified by the fluid flow through parallel chancel through the comparison with the theoretical solution then the effects of resolution and representative element volume rev are studied to obtain reliable and accurate results after that the effects of particle size and porosity on permeability are systematically studied and the modified k c equation is proposed finally the constant head test is carried out on the glass beads to verify the accuracy of the proposed model 2 methodology 2 1 lattice boltzmann method lbm the lattice boltzmann method lbm is the discrete form of the boltzmann bgk equation bhatnagar et al 1954 it is generally composed of an evolution equation of distribution function discrete velocity model an equilibrium distribution function qian et al 1992 proposed the ddqm model d represents the number of dimensions and m represents the number of discrete velocities and the d2q9 model is one of the most widely used models in the lattice boltzmann method in this paper the incompressible lbgk model is used in which the evolution equation of the density distribution function is defined as 1 f i x c e i δ x t δ t f i x t ω i f i x t where c δ x δ t δ x and δ t are the lattice grid spacing and time step respectively e i is the discrete velocity direction and can be expressed as eq 2 and ω i f i x t is the collision operator and can be acquired by eq 3 2 e i 0 0 c c o s i 1 π 2 s i n i 1 π 2 2 c c o s 2 i 1 π 4 s i n 2 i 1 π 4 i 0 i 1 3 5 7 i 2 4 6 8 3 ω i 1 τ f i f i eq where τ is the relaxation time and f i eq is the equilibrium distribution function given by 4 f i eq ρ ω i 1 e i u c s 2 e i u 2 2 c s 4 u 2 2 c s 2 where ω i is the weight factor expressed as 5 ω i 4 9 i 0 1 9 i 1 3 5 7 1 36 i 2 4 6 8 the macroscopic density and velocity can be obtained as 6 ρ i 1 m f i 7 ρ u i 1 m f i e i accordingly the incompressible navier stokes equations can be derived through multi scaling expansion as 8 u 0 9 u t uu p ν 2 u where p c s 2 ρ is the pressure and ν is the kinetic viscosity given by 10 ν 2 τ 1 c 2 δ t 6 2 2 verification of the lbm the poiseuille flow with the theoretical solution is used to verify the accuracy of lbm the calculation model is a 6 mm 6 mm square with a resolution of 50 the calculation formula of the vertical distribution of poiseuille flow velocity is as follows 11 u y j 2 μ h 2 4 y 2 where u y is the velocity at any point in the direction j is the hydraulic gradient h is the pipe width and μ is the fluid viscosity the velocity distribution in the parallel plate model is obtained by the lbm and the maximum velocity is at the center of the channel fig 1 a the simulation results of the velocity at each point of the middle section of the parallel plate are compared with the theoretical results fig 1b after calculation the error between the simulation results and the theoretical results is 1 26 which meets the requirements of the test error and proves the accuracy of the lbm program in this paper 3 numerical simulation of fluid flow through porous media 3 1 generation of porous media and the boundary conditions the discrete element method is used to generate the 2d porous media by specifying the generation range and porosity in this paper the radius expansion method is used to generate the porous media to ensure that the particles are evenly distributed in the simulation region firstly porous media with target porosity are randomly generated in the specified range fig 2 a and then the radius is enlarged according to the specified amplification factor e g 1 3 fig 2b finally the radius decreased to the normal value so the generated model is the same with the target porosity and particles sizes fig 2c the boundary conditions in the simulation are set as follows the upper and lower walls as well as the solid particles adopt the standard bounce back scheme the left boundary adopts the nonequilibrium bounce back scheme and the right boundary adopts the fully developed scheme khajepor et al 2019 zou and he 1997 3 2 effect of resolution in the lbm the resolution affects the efficiency and accuracy of the results to ensure the accuracy of calculation the minimum resolution of the simulation was firstly determined as suggested by hager et al 2014 the size of the grid is required to be at least 1 10 1 8 of the particle diameter to this end the particle size of the porous media sample is 1 mm the porosity is 0 5 and the generated area is a 10 mm 10 mm square the model is imported to the lbm for calculation under the same boundary conditions and pressure gradient the permeability of porous media samples with different resolutions is simulated the simulation result is presented in fig 3 the permeability of porous media increases gradually with the improvement of resolution and comes to a steady state when the resolution approaches 50 therefore the resolution is set to 50 for subsequent simulation in this paper 3 3 effect of representative elementary volume rev the representative elementary volume rev is proposed by bear 1972 in the seepage analysis of soil and the permeability of rev can be used to represent the permeability of the soil a reasonable calculation size can avoid wasting computing resources in the simulation process to this end the random porous media with the size of 20 mm 20 mm is firstly generated the particle size is set as 1 mm and the porosity is 0 5 then the representative elementary volume is extracted from the generated model with sizes changing from 2 mm to 13 mm the revs with different sizes are imported to the lbm for calculation fig 4 a the permeability of porous media comes to a steady state as the size increases fig 4b it is found that when the size of rev is greater than 10 times of particle size the permeability fluctuates around 11 3 10 4 mm2 therefore the size of rev in the following seepage simulation of porous media is 10 times the minimum particle size 3 4 simulation of fluid flow through porous media with uniform particle size to study the effect of porosity on seepage characteristics of porous media the particle size is set as a fixed value of 1 mm the porous media models with different porosity are generated and the simulation result from lbm is shown in fig 5 it can be seen that when the porosity is small the number of seepage channels increases rapidly with the increase of the porosity and the number of seepage channels is the major factor that affects the permeability however when the porosity is slightly larger the number of seepage channels does not increase with the increase of the porosity at this time the average size of pore throat is the major factor affecting the permeability the correlation between permeability and porosity is summarized in fig 6 3 5 simulation of fluid flow through porous media with different particle sizes the effect of particle size on the seepage characteristics of porous media is studied and the fixed porosity is set to 0 4 and particle size is changing from 0 2 mm to 1 6 mm it can be found that the number of pore channels decreases and the channel size increases with the increase of particle size and the permeability increases with the particle size as shown in fig 7 3 6 analysis of numerical simulation results of uniform particle size in 1972 bear 1972 proposed the general expression of permeability 12 k f 1 s f 2 n d 2 where f 1 s is the correlation function of particle shape f 2 n is the correlation function of porosity d is the particle size in eq 12 the particle size d is not specified and a more general expression is proposed in this paper 13 k f 1 s f 2 n f 3 d m where dm is the representative particle size such as d10 hazen 1911 terzaghi 1925 d20 china institute of water resources and hydropower 1982 in fig 6 there is an obvious positive correlation between permeability and porosity therefore the seepage simulation results of porous media with uniform particle size are analyzed by the linear fitting method fig 8 there is an extremely high correlation between porosity function n3 1 n 2 and permeability and the correlation coefficient is 0 99 therefore the correlation function of porosity f 2 n is expressed as 14 f 2 n n 3 1 n 2 in addition to study the correlation between representative particle size and permeability eq 15 is used for analysis in this paper 15 k a d m a a d a take logarithm on both sides of eq 15 to get eq 16 16 lg k lg a a lg d with lgk as the abscissa and lgdm as the ordinate the scatter diagram is drawn and fitted fig 9 there is a high linear correlation between lgk and lgdm and the correlation coefficient is 0 99 the slope of the fitting curve a 1 92 is close to 2 hence the correlation function of the representative particle size can be expressed as 17 f 3 d m d m 2 according to the classical k c equation 18 k 1 s 0 2 c k c e 3 1 e where s 0 is the specific surface area given by 19 s 0 4 3 π d 2 3 4 π d 2 2 6 d therefore for porous media with uniform particle size 20 k d 2 1 s 0 2 by dimensional transformation of eq 13 the classical k c equation eq 18 can be transformed into 21 k 1 c k 1 s 0 2 n 3 1 n 2 3 7 simulation of fluid flow in porous media with uniform particle size interval in order to simulate porous media with uniform particle size interval uniform samples with particle size intervals of 0 5 0 5 mm 0 5 1 0 mm 0 5 1 5 mm 0 5 2 mm 0 5 2 5 mm and 0 5 3 mm are generated respectively for each particle size interval the former value is the minimum particle size and the latter one is the maximum particle size and the particle are uniformly generated within this range each particle size interval corresponded to different porosity 0 30 0 60 and 42 test conditions are conducted according to the simulation results of porous media seepage with uniform particle size interval the ck values in the k c equation are inversely calculated fig 10 it can be seen that the ck values are not constant in the same particle size interval the ck value decreases with the increase of the porosity and gradually tend to a stable value which is essentially between 4 8 5 3 carrier iii 2003 when the porosity is between 0 3 0 4 the the ck value decreases dramaticallly however when the porosity is greater than 0 4 the decline rate of the ck value slows down in fig 10 it is obvious that porosity is the main factor affecting the ck value and there is a logarithmic relationship between porosity and 1 ck so logarithmic fitting is adopted fig 11 to make the fitting results more meaningful the 1 ck takes the average value under the same porosity 0 3 0 5 according to the results of the fitting 22 1 c k a b l n n in the eq 22 a 0 391 b 0 269 at this time the k c equation is expressed as 23 k 0 391 0 269 l n n 1 s 0 2 n 3 1 n 2 eq 23 is a modification of the k c equation for porous media with uniform particle size intervals 3 8 simulation of fluid flow in porous media with mixed particle size to study the permeability characteristics of porous media with mixed particle size the generation area of the mixed particle size model is 25 mm 25 mm square and the porosity is 0 4 then two groups of porous media particle size intervals of 0 5 1 5 mm and 1 5 2 5 mm respectively are generated in this area porous media with different gradations are generated by controlling the relative content of the two groups of particle size intervals and 11 test conditions are conducted which are listed in table 1 the scatter diagram is drawn with the percentage content of particle size interval of 0 5 1 5 mm as the abscissa and the 1 ck as the ordinate fig 12 with the same porosity 1 ck changes with the relative percentage of mixed particle size in the case of uniform particle size interval the percentage content of 0 5 1 5 mm is 0 or 100 the development degree of the pore channel is good and 1 ck is large in the case of mixed particle size 0 the percentage content of 0 5 1 5 mm 100 due to the filling effect of fine particles on the pore channel of coarse particles the pore channel is narrow and the 1 ck is small the coefficient of uniformity cu is the quantity to measure the non uniformity of soil in fig 13 1 ck decreases with the increase of cu because of the enhancement of particle filling effect and the insufficient development of pore channel in the 11 test conditions of mixed particle size simulated in this paper the maximum deviation is 10 which can be accepted in engineering therefore the modification of the k c equation eq 23 based on uniform particle size interval is also applicable in mixed particle size 4 experimental study and verification 4 1 material the glass beads are used as porous media to obtain permeability with different porosity and particle size the custom glass beads are used for the test it can effectively reduce the influence of the shape parameters of porous media on permeability five glass beads with different particle sizes are used in the test including 0 6 0 8 mm 0 8 1 2 mm 1 2 1 5 mm 1 5 2 mm and 2 3 mm fig 14 in addition to reduce the error caused by gas in the sample distilled water is used to saturate the sample 4 2 test equipment the existing tst 70 type constant head permeameter has many problems in use such as loading samples evenly is difficult porosity is difficult to control etc these problems will engender large errors in the test to solve the above problems a set of instruments made of polymethyl methacrylate pmma is studied in this paper fig 15 the permeameter is mainly composed of two parts the seepage occurred part and the constant head control part two parts are connected by threads and the inner diameter is 5 cm which meets the requirements of the specification of soil test sl237 1999 so it can be used to determine the permeability of porous media samples with particle sizes less than 5 mm 4 3 test conditions 1 laboratory tests with uniform particle size interval constant head tests are carried out on the 5 glass bead samples with different particle size intervals including 0 6 0 8 mm 0 8 1 2 mm 1 2 1 5 mm 1 5 2 mm and 2 3 mm during the test by controlling the dry density method the porous media under each particle interval are compacted to different porosity including 25 groups of tests 2 laboratory tests with mixed particle size the glass beads are compacted with five particle size intervals and the total number of 15 particle size distributions is generated as listed in table 2 4 4 verification of the prediction formula with uniform particle size interval constant head tests are carried out on the glass beads with self designed water head instruments and according to the test results to verify the prediction model of the permeability proposed in the above section eq 23 it is found that the relative error of the modified k c equation is much smaller than that of the classical k c equation compared with the experimental results fig 16 4 5 verification of the prediction formula with mixed particle size according to the results of constant head tests the applicability of the permeability prediction is verified for mixed particle size the predicted value of the classical k c equation is 2 09 2 73 of the test results while the ratio of the predicted value of the modified k c equation to the test results is close to 1 based on the results in table 3 which shows the validity of the modified k c equation 5 conclusion remarks in this study the permeability of porous media is studied by using the combination of lbm and dem meanwhile the constant head test is carried out on glass beads with different porosity and particle size distribution based on the results from numerical simulation and experiments the following conclusion can be drawn 1 based on the numerical simulation the linear correlations between n 3 1 n 2 d 2 and permeability are established the physical constant ck is found closely related to the porosity with 1 ck a bln n based on which the modified k c equation is established 2 according to the experimental results of fluid flow in glass beads with uniform particle sizes the relative error of the modified k c equation 7 77 18 55 is much smaller than the classical k c equation 37 66 52 86 3 from the test results of fluid flow through glass beads with mixed particle sizes the ratio between the predicted permeability of the classical k c equation and the experimental results is 2 09 2 73 whereas the ratio is close to 1 for the modified k c equation 4 compared with the classical k c equation the modified k c equation is more accurate which is applicable for both uniform and non uniform particles
