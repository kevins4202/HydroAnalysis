10135,real evapotranspiration etr plays a key role in water balance especially for dry forest vegetation caatinga and irrigated agricultural areas as is the case in the petrolina region located in the brazilian semiarid region bsar population growth increases the need for food and the use of water resources which are scarcer in semiarid regions thus knowledge of the energy balance eb and radiative balance are indispensable for the management of water resources especially in irrigated agricultural areas currently one of the biggest challenges in the application of algorithms for estimating etr based on satellite images is the calibration of the eb the goal of this study was to evaluate the applicability of geographic resources analysis support system grass python surface eb algorithm for land gp sebal to calculate etr for caatinga vegetation and agricultural areas in the bsar gp sebal was applied to two images from landsat 8 obtained in 2013 and compared with manual sebal and observed data in this study kappa coefficient accuracy was used to compare the ground truth data and predicted land use and land cover the performance of algorithms in determining the eb components land surface temperature lst net radiation rn soil heat flux g latent heat flux le sensible heat flux h and etr were compared with statistical indices and uncertainty percentages pus were calculated in addition a sensitivity analysis using a deviation of 30 w m2 with an interval of 5 w m2 was used to analyze the sensitivity of etr the results showed a strong correlation between gp sebal and manual sebal for etr lst rn lh and h the values suggest the regularity of estimating the eb in an automated manner the results indicate a small pu difference in the estimated etr values calculated using gp sebal and sebal for two images of 10 87 and 20 11 for caatinga vegetation and 15 01 and 35 16 for agriculture respectively we conclude that gp sebal is an efficient automated algorithm for estimating etr that uses a less complex process with a lower incidence of errors and considerably faster execution time than classical applications of sebal keywords automated evapotranspiration caatinga vegetation agriculture grass gis python language sebal brazil 1 introduction among the hydrological variables real evapotranspiration etr is the one that plays an important role in the water balance of semiarid regions xiang et al 2020 evapotranspiration et is necessary to understand the behavior of the hydrological processes and is fundamental for water management especially in regions with semiarid climates etr knowledge and control are vital for better agricultural production the brazilian semiarid region bsar is characterized by water scarcity and a high rate of etr in most of its area although places with an abundance of surface water such as the irrigated agricultural region of petrolina also exist barros et al 2015 currently the demands for food and the generation of wealth by agriculture are important reasons for understanding etr the irrigated agricultural region of petrolina is responsible for substantial food production and is influenced by the water from the são francisco river which irrigates approximately 100 000 ha of cropland cabral júnior et al 2019 et accounts for most of the water consumption across the northeastern region of brazil the allocation of water resources in the petrolina region is of enormous practical importance to ensure fruit production in addition understanding the et helps prepare the water management policies designed to address effects of climate variability land use land cover lulc and future climate changes on local etr however few studies have applied surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal to the bsar to analyze etr in agriculture and caatinga vegetation silva et al 2019 veloso et al 2020 dos santos et al 2020 mainly using an open source script and free geographic information system software actually studies performing simulation and validation of etr are scarce in the context of the assessment of the land surface radiation components for the bsar ferreira et al 2020 several methods have been developed for acquiring etr including bowen s ratio turbulent vortex covariance techniques and scintillometers oliveira et al 2014 teixeira et al 2007 all of these procedures are expensive and their extrapolation to other areas makes the techniques imprecise and impracticable however these methods consider only small areas mahmoud and alazba 2016a 2016b in contrast the use of remote sensing products has been used around the world santos et al 2019 garrido rubio et al 2020 thus etr estimates for large areas are possible based on remote sensing applications energy balance eb algorithms have been applied worldwide lee and kim 2016 and among the more frequently used are the surface energy balance index sebi menenti and choudhury 1993 sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution using internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 the two source energy balance tseb timmermans et al 2007 and et watch wu et al 2008 a large number of studies on the usage of these algorithms and others are available in the literature zhang et al 2020 undoubtedly among these eb algorithms sebal is the most widely acknowledged validated and applied around the world mhawej et al 2020a recently sebal has been applied in precision agriculture and numerous hydrological applications bhattarai et al 2016 mhawej et al 2020b sun et al 2011 losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 evaluated the application of metric sebal and sebs algorithms to the evaporation in the amirkabir reservoir rahimzadegan and janani 2019 analyzed etr using the sebal algorithm based on landsat 8 satellite imagery for pistachio crop in brazil teixeira et al 2009a reviewed sebal input parameters using combined satellite data and field measurements to examine the application of various sebal steps in the low middle são francisco river basin teixeira et al 2009b applied sebal at the regional scale within the bsar to analyze etr and water productivity santos et al 2017a 2017b estimated etr for several land covers in a typical watershed of the bsar ferreira et al 2020 estimated net radiation and its components in contrasting lulc using remote sensing products for an agricultural area in the bsar we highlight that the acquisition of data for eb estimation by remote sensing has a high degree of complexity requiring much time of the researcher and data for calibration studies of automated calibration that really show their effectiveness have been performed bhattarai liu 2019 silva et al 2019 jaafar ahmad 2020 and new applications are encouraged in last few years the number of studies on automation and improvements in sebal has increased considerably bhattarai et al 2017a developed an automated algorithm for selecting the anchor pixel in the sebal and metric algorithms silva et al 2019 created an automatic algorithm to calculate etr from modis products using statistical criteria for endmember pixel selection mhawej et al 2020b proposed a dynamic calibration approach for a better et estimation using sebal automated in the python language in the sebal algorithm the various stages of modeling especially the process of choosing the hot and cold anchor pixels in an iterative process of calculating the eb are an important step in estimating etr bhattarai and liu 2019 according to french et al 2015 the process of automating sebal might extend avenues for multi model ensemble etr predictions on a large scale when the application of a single model is often challenging given this scenario this study presents geographic resources analysis support system grass python sebal gp sebal a new python based methodology for the application of fully automated versions of sebal to landsat images which was adapted for regions lacking soil related datasets gp sebal was applied in a totally free environment and contributes an application that facilitates fusion cloud correction and the automated choice of pixels based on the ground cover 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area the study area chosen for this analysis was the garças river basin this basin is located in the caatinga biome region in brazil more precisely at the latitude coordinates 8 10 s and 8 80 s and longitude coordinates 40 80 w and 39 70 w fig 1 and has area of 4094 km2 the petrolina juazeiro agricultural complex is located in this basin within the sub middle são francisco river basin the main economic activity of this region is fruit production the region has the natural conditions necessary for the development of this activity combining insolation and heat levels with the dry climate of the bsar and favorable soil for irrigation these factors enable several annual harvests and higher quality products giving it a competitive position in the global fruit trade oliveira filho et al 2014 caatinga vegetation is a steppe savanna with bush and dense canopy and this vegetation is typical of the bsar the more common species are in the genera spondias mimosa and aspidosperma de lima 2019 mean annual rainfall in the region of the garças river basin has ranged from 500 to 800 mm over the last 30 years and the rainy season in the region is between january and april brito et al 2021 the average annual relative humidity is 70 and the mean daily temperature is 29 c silva et al 2005 2 2 orbital images and lulc classification land use and land cover lulc classification of 30 m landsat 8 oli tirs images orbit 217 and point 66 captured on 3 september 2013 were retrieved from the united states geological survey usgs as described by cunha et al 2021 this image was chosen because it represents the lulc during the dry period which is the most common condition for this region throughout the year in this study the maximum likelihood method was applied for the lulc classification the maximum likelihood classifier is a method based on statistical classification approach in which class signatures are allocated to have normal distributions this method was used because it provides estimators with a reasonable intuitive basis and many suitable statistical properties and has been extensively used worldwide with good results the fusion of the landsat 5 tm with the landsat 8 oli tirs panchromatic 8 band image was applied to reduce the uncertainties of image classification fusion was performed using the gdal pansharpen tool in the gdal algorithm appel et al 2018 thus with the fusion the images changed from 30 to 15 m allowing a better lulc classification in this study five lulcs were classified a water bodies b agriculture croplands and pasture c exposed soil and d caatinga vegetation formed by shrub vegetation and herbaceous vegetation this vegetation has the characteristics of deciduous xerophytic shrubs vegetation and open trees the terrain digital elevation model was obtained and processed using the method reported by silva et al 2019 the meteorological data used here were collected from the bebedouro agrometeorological station http www cpatsa embrapa br 8080 servicos dadosmet ceb dia html located in petrolina city 2 3 accuracy assessment of the lulc classified image the use of criteria to evaluate and compare the accuracy of thematic mapping is a fundamental technique to describe the quality of image classification according to congalton 1991 an error matrix is useful to apply a series of descriptive and analytical statistical techniques the estimation of the lulc classification consistency was tested by determining the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient k the overall accuracy is estimated by splitting the sum of the main diagonal of the error matrix x ii by the total number of collected samples n 1 o c i 1 x i i n in which x ii is the value in row i and column i and c is the number of classes the accuracy of a class is shown by the producer and user accuracies producer accuracy is directed to samples that have not been properly classified into the correct classes and omitted from their appropriate category and user accuracy is directed to the chance that a classified cell in the image symbolizes that class this statistic is calculated as follows 2 κ n c i 1 x i i c i 1 x i x i n 2 c i 1 x i x i in which κ is the kappa statistic x i is the sum of row i and x i is the sum of column i of the confusion matrix in this study the classification validation process was based on the confusion matrix which also used the user s accuracy producer s accuracy omission and commission measures as described by silva et al 2020 the classified map was statistically tested with random validation samples collected from orbital imagery and samples verified in the field an independent collection of points of each lulc class was used to validate the classified classes that remained unchanged in the analyzed image a group of 1000 samples was randomly selected after image fusion and checked in the field 2 4 determination of net radiation and etr two 30 m landsat 8 oli tirs orbit 217 and point 66 satellite images captured on 3 september 2013 doy 246 and 5 october 2013 doy 278 were used the sebal algorithm was used as described by coelho et al 2017 and bhattarai et al 2017a 2017b to calculate the components of the eb the net radiation is calculated as follows 3 r n r s 1 α sup r o r om 1 ε 0 r om where rn is the instantaneous net radiation w m2 rs is incident short wave radiation αsup is corrected surface albedo ro is factor that corresponds to the longwave radiation emitted by each pixel of the image rom is longwave radiation emitted by the atmosphere toward each pixel of the image and εo corresponds to the emissivity values of each pixel of the image the soil heat flux g is reported in w m2 and obtained using eq 4 bastiaanssen 2000 4 g lst α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 0 98 ndvi 4 r n where lst is the land surface temperature c ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index and α is surface albedo sensible heat flux h in w m2 is estimated based on wind speed and lst using internal calibration of the temperature difference close to the surface between two levels close to the surface with eq 5 which was proposed by bastiaanssen et al 1998 5 h ρ c p a bt s a r where ρ is the specific mass of air cp is the specific heat of air at a constant pressure of 1004 j kg k a and b represent the calibration constants of the temperature difference between two levels z1 and z2 and ar is the aerodynamic resistance of heat transport s m latent heat flux le in w m2 was obtained by calculating the difference between rn g and h eq 6 bastiaanssen et al 1998 mohamed et al 2004 this parameter was calculated for the moment of the passage of the satellite in the study area 6 l e r n g h the first step in obtaining the values of etr mm day is to evaluate the instantaneous evaporative fraction ef using eq 7 bastiaanssen et al 1998 finally daily evapotranspiration is calculated using eq 8 7 e f l e r n g 8 etr 0 035 e f r n 2 5 automated algorithm implementation and evaluation an open source python 3 7 script was executed in grass software to estimate the etr this integration was named grass python sebal gp sebal and was developed to automate etr value retrieval based on a computer software library specialized in many computational functions such as vector reading and raster image processing and writing this study compared the manual application of sebal described in the study of bastiaanssen 1995 with the proposed gp sebal algorithm in this study the values of a set 1000 sample points of eb components were extracted which were selected randomly gp sebal estimated etr and saved the results of all steps in different ascii files with an execution time of approximately 5 min on average when saving and less than 1 min without saving all results in this step gp sebal was run using a computer with a 3 30 ghz intel dell processor e3 1240 cpu 8 gb of ram and a 64 bit windows 10 operating system the classical sebal algorithm was created while considering the usually utilized theory that etr can be calculated from the residual term of the surface eb and determines rn and g directly using input data nevertheless the application of sebal and the adequate choice of hot and cold pixels is the most complex stage in the application of this algorithm because sebal requires a modeler with a substantial experience in energy fluxes and etr moreover a large number of working hours is necessary for image processing using manual sebal in addition to all these steps needed for the etr simulation a risk of human errors in the sebal application exists allen et al 2002 for instance for the application of sebal a strong manual process for the selection of the endmember in the image is required silva et al 2019 the difference between gp sebal and sebal methods is that the etr calculation processes are automated using open source and fast processing moreover this automated algorithm contains a an internal cloud removal process that b generates accurate and acceptable pixel values in some shaded areas or images with clouds c uses the atmospherically corrected satellite images to calculate vegetation indices d performs pixel resampling from 30 to 15 m e image segmentation and supervised image classification and f selects the cold and hot pixels fig 2 shows the general flowchart of the study the following input data are necessary to apply gp sebal a an orbital image b digital elevation model c latitude and longitude data d meteorological data e wind speed f air temperature g day and month the image was captured and h global average daily solar radiation data in w m2 in the first step the algorithm corrects the images radiance and reflectance next soil adjusted vegetation index savi leaf area index lai normalized difference vegetation index ndvi albedo lst emissivity rn g h and le are automatically calculated then masks are created that identify all the hot and cold pixels in the images based on the ndvi and lst values due to the complexity of the study area caatinga vegetation and the choice of the cold and hot pixels this study used manual selection of cold and hot pixels this selection is based on criteria of lulc classification lst and albedo values the pixels defined as cold were those that showed the highest albedo values and lowest temperatures in the image the hot pixels were those with the highest lst values usually pixels classified as exposed soil after the selection of cold and hot pixels the iterative process is performed where the algorithm performs the adjustment seeking stability when the gp sebal identifies stability the h le rn and ef are calculated and finally the daily etr is obtained 2 6 observed energy fluxes in this study energy flow data were used for calibration and comparison between manual sebal and gp sebal results the data were collected in an automated micrometeorological tower located at the coordinates 9 05 s and 40 19 w at a 350 m altitude this tower is equipped with electronic sensors to quantify the components of the radiation energy and other environmental parameters the tower is 16 m high with two measurement systems low and high frequency the low frequency system measures the components of energy components of radiation lst relative humidity and precipitation the high frequency system performs measurements at 10 hz and is composed of a three dimensional sonic anemometer to measure fluctuations in wind speed and air temperature a thermistor was installed on the ground to measure lst rn h and le parameters which were compared with estimated data obtained using sebal and gp sebal the heat flow in the soil was measured using a flow meter an infrared gas analyzer is also installed in the tower to obtain the water vapor concentration the experimental data from the caatinga vegetation area and the methodology for collecting and processing the data were reported by souza et al 2015 carvalho et al 2018 and ferreira et al 2020 this experiment was carried out between january and december 2013 in an area of 600 ha of caatinga vegetation that has been preserved for over 35 years the experimental area has soil of the eutrophic yellow argisol type the vegetation is caatinga vegetation composed of arboreal shrubby hyperxerophilous and deciduous species with small leaves and a height ranging from 4 to 7 m 2 7 performance sensitivity analysis and uncertainty the developed automated approach was evaluated based on its capacity to accurately predict the performance of the eb and etr between sebal and gp sebal thus commonly used model evaluation criteria such as nash sutcliffe ns percent bias pbias root mean square errors rmse mean absolute deviation mad mean square error mse mean absolute percentage error mape mean percentage error mpe coefficient of correlation r and coefficient of determination r2 were used as proposed by rahimzadegan and janani 2019 and bhattarai et al 2017a variability measures were also analyzed to test the variations between the results obtained manually and with gp sebal in this study a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effect of each parameter surface albedo lst rn g h and le on etr estimates using the approach proposed by timmermans et al 2007 and also used by faridatul et al 2020 9 etr i s m s gp s gp 100 where etri is the sensitivity of the model to an input i sm is predicted by the model when the input energy flux equals its reference value and sgp is the increase and decrease in values of eb components after analyzing the sensitivity the values of the input energy fluxes were modified to compute sm and the sensitivity to etri was defined a change of 30 w m2 30 w m2 to 30 w m2 with an interval of 5 w m2 was applied to test the sensitivity of etr estimation uncertainty calculations for the seven eb components were conducted to quantify the adjustment between gp sebal and manual sebal the obtained results were compared with the results obtained by the two methods in this study the percentage uncertainty percentage up was used to investigate the uncertainty of each eb component evaluating the gp sebal forecast uncertainty is important to know the quality of this algorithm in predicting etr the percentage of measurements provides empirical evidence that the estimate is realistic 3 results and discussion 3 1 accuracy and evaluation of the lulc classification the spatial distribution of the lulc classes for 2013 are shown in fig 3 this basin consists mainly of the caatinga vegetation 75 68 and exposed soil 23 02 classes which are typical of the caatinga biome in the region the agriculture class occupies a total area of 52 60 km2 1 28 a large part of which is irrigated and depends substantially on water controlled by et the agriculture class is predominantly occupied by fruit production in croplands and pasture formed by small areas of cattle farms the agriculture class is responsible for the principal economic activity of the region the accuracy statistics for the classification results and the results of commission and omission of the image are shown in table 1 the classification accuracy ranged from 76 7 to 83 3 and the kappa coefficient ranged from 88 4 to 88 6 the overall kappa coefficient and overall accuracy calculated for the whole image were equal to 88 9 and 77 5 respectively the results of commission and omission obtained show that all classes had good adjustments in the classification these results are good for a basin located in the caatinga biome where the vegetation is rarefied dry and are similar to those obtained by santos et al 2017a 2017b in contrast portions of irrigated agriculture and larger vegetation shrub vegetation are located mainly on the banks of the rivers in the region where more water is stored and the soils are deeper dantas et al 2020 3 2 comparison of sebal gp sebal and observed data fig 4a l present the correlations calculated between estimated values for eb components from two images using gp sebal and sebal fig 4a b show a statistical comparison of the performance of sebal and gp sebal in estimating surface albedo values the albedo values show a good fit between the values obtained manually and using the automated algorithm for all classes of lulc the results of the statistical indices show excellent adjustments with r2 0 97 and an rmse of 0 01 for the two images indicating a strong positive correlation and good agreement between the estimated values however the results of pbias show that gp sebal underestimates the automated values in relation to those of sebal 1 92 the values obtained for lst fig 4c d also show an excellent correlation with r2 and ns 0 99 and rmse ranging from 0 13 to 0 16 indicating a good estimate of this component by gp sebal tests were also applied with the pbias resulting in a slight overestimation ranging from 0 013 to 0 03 the rn values estimated using sebal and gp sebal are shown in fig 4e f the results were excellent r2 0 94 ns 0 94 rmse 9 32 w m2 and pbias ranging 0 03 0 58 indicating a slight overestimation of the estimated values using the automated algorithm fig 4g h show a comparison of the performance of sebal and gp sebal in estimating values for g the statistical behavior of g is also considered very good r2 0 88 however the results showed an overestimation with pbias ranging from 0 10 to 1 85 for the two images fig 4i j shows a statistical comparison between sebal and gp sebal for h values substantial differences in the estimates of h are obtained using the two methods because gp sebal underestimated the values compared with the manual sebal this difference is evidenced by the variation in the results of pbias mad mse mape and mpe in contrast the r and r2 indices are considered good the values for the correlation of le fig 4k l are also considered excellent statistically r2 0 97 however the results showed an overestimation of the values obtained using gp sebal the values of mad mse mape and mpe varied subtly and are considered satisfactory table 2 shows the results of the comparison between estimated energy flux values obtained using sebal and gp sebal for each lulc class pbias results show that the rn values for the caatinga exposed soil and agriculture classes are underestimated while it is overestimated for the water class the results of the comparison for g show mad values ranging from 1 3 to 2 8 w m2 in the image captured on 3 september 2013 while in the image captured on 5 october 2013 the values range from 4 7 to 9 9 w m2 the pbias results show that gp sebal underestimated the values in all lulc in the image captured on 3 september 2013 in the image captured on 5 october 2013 the gp sebal overestimated the g values for the caatinga exposed soil and agriculture classes the results of h highlight a greater error in the agriculture class while the lowest values of rmse are calculated for the caatinga class in both images the value of h was also slightly overestimated for the image captured on 3 september 2013 for the caatinga and exposed soil classes for le the values were underestimated in all classes in the image captured on 3 september 2013 while in the image captured on 5 october 2013 the le values were overestimated for the caatinga and agriculture classes based on these results the values of the eb components in the image captured on 5 october 2013 show greater variability than the image captured on 3 september 2013 based on the mad mape and rmse values fig 5 shows the uncertainty percentage between gp sebal and sebal for each lulc for the two analyzed images the pu was higher for the image captured on 5 october 2013 higher h values were registered for caatinga and exposed soil classes in this image ranging from 35 to 77 according to sebal and from 46 to 36 using gp sebal higher g values were obtained for the agriculture and exposed soil classes the highest g values were estimated in the exposed soil class and also occurred in the image captured on 5 october 2013 the lowest values for g were recorded in caatinga areas ranging from 2 to 8 in accordance with the results obtained by arraes et al 2012 and atasevera et al 2013 the lowest rn values were obtained in the caatinga and agriculture areas with values 20 while the areas without vegetation cover showed the highest values for rn with values ranging from 25 to 30 in the regions without vegetation radiation is released more quickly helping increase the air temperature in these areas for areas with vegetation the release of absorbed radiation occurs more slowly during the day causing rn to remain elevated lins et al 2017 silva et al 2016 the highest le values were obtained for exposed soil in two images while the lowest values were obtained for the caatinga and agriculture classes the h and g components had the highest pu values in the image captured on 3 september 2013 and h and g parameters showed the highest uncertainties in the image captured on 5 october 2013 in most comparisons the sebal values showed greater uncertainties than the automated method these results are similar to those reported by bhattarai and liu 2019 silva et al 2019 bhattarai et al 2017a and faridatul et al 2020 moreover rn and le had the lowest uncertainties in all classes except for exposed soil in the image captured on 5 october 2013 small discrepancies were observed between the results of gp sebal and the manual sebal the uncertainties between the two analyzed methods are considered small fig 6 shows observed hourly data for rn h and le and estimated values obtained using sebal and gp sebal for the two images analyzed in this study the results of this comparison show that the gp sebal performed well and that the image captured on 5 october 2013 showed greater variation and the highest values for rn h and le gp sebal performed well compared to the manual sebal and the observed data gp sebal overestimated the values of rn and h in relation to those observed on 3 september 2013 ranging from 13 to 25 while the le was underestimated by 26 the sebal results showed that the values for rn h and le were 32 42 10 95 and 8 41 respectively the difference in the values obtained in the two images shows the high variability of the eb components in this region as also highlighted by bezerra et al 2015 silva et al 2015a 2015b and coelho et al 2017 however gp sebal estimated the values of rn h and le that were similar to the data observed in the micrometeorological towers these results highlight that gp sebal was able to adequately represent the values of rn h and le in both images and that gp sebal should be considered a useful tool to estimate eb components in the bsar these values show the substantial variability of etr in this region and the difficulty of automated algorithms in estimating good results nevertheless the values obtained using gp sebal are considered very good 3 3 mapping of eb components and sensitivity analysis the progress of techniques and biophysical modeling to calculate eb components from orbital image data has been used extensively over the past three decades mainly in regional and global studies such as those monitoring land cover change fig 7a l show the geographic distribution of the biophysical parameters estimated using gp sebal for the garças river basin in the two images fig 7a b show the regional distribution of surface albedo the surface albedo values showed substantial variability ranging from 5 to 55 which was also reported by silva et al 2015a 2015b these values are related to the characteristics of climate and the caatinga vegetation cover that have the capacity to become a verdant green vegetation after rain events fig 7c d show the maps of lst over the basin with values ranging from 22 to 37 c as expected the highest lst values were concentrated in the exposed soil class the results show coherence between the different lulc classes except for water which had a small difference between the estimated values according to santos et al 2017a 2017b the rn values show a high variability ranging from 200 to 700 w m2 and high values occurred in all portions of the basin fig 7e f similar results have been reported by borges et al 2015 and lafayette et al 2019 fig 7g h show the g values which indicated that the highest values occurred in the study area ranging from 40 to 240 w m2 higher values occurred in the northern portion of the basin which contains a greater amount of exposed soil while the high values occurred in southern portion in the second image fig 7i j show the spatial distribution of h estimates for the study area the h values ranged from 40 to 260 w m2 this parameter is considered the main parameter in the eb process calculated using the sebal algorithm bastiaanssen et al 1998 for reasons explained above this parameter showed greater variation than the other parameters in study area notably the spatial distribution of the highest values of the parameter h are similar to the highest values of g fig 7k l show the map le estimated using gp sebal with values ranging from 20 to 580 w m2 the estimated g and le values are similar to the values obtained by teixeira et al 2009a 2009b we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of eb components on etr fig 8 shows the sensitivity of etr to changes in rn g h and le the input values of eb components were disturbed and the sensitivity to these components has been listed the results of the etr sensitivity analysis with changes in the rn values are shown in fig 8a b notably the rn values positively correlated with the etr thus an increase or decrease of 30 w m2 in rn results in the greatest change in the etr moreover a greater sensitivity of the parameters rn g and h was observed in the image captured on 3 september 2013 while only the parameter le showed greater sensitivity in the image captured on 5 october 2013 the results showed a positive linear correlation between g and etr with the largest relative change in etr 30 fig 8c d the results showed a positive linear correlation between the changes in h with etr fig 8e f as the positive changes were constant for the results obtained using gp sebal for the two images the results showed greater sensitivity of values calculated using sebal as the percent change increases the results of gp sebal showed a greater variation only in changes greater than 25 while in the other intervals the variation is constant for h a similar behavior was also perceived for g a decrease of 30 w m2 in h results in an etr variation of approximately 10 20 the changes in the le parameter and its relationship to etr are shown in fig 8g h the results revealed a positive correlation where an increase or decrease of 30 w m2 in le results in a change of more than 10 20 in the etr estimate notably etr is sensitive to changes in le but presents a lower relative change than for changes in the other parameters in the image captured on 3 september 2013 unlike the results obtained for the image captured on 5 october 2013 etr was also highly sensitive to changes in g based on changes in rn h and le according to faridatul et al 2020 the sensitivity varies for energy flows because it depends on the type of ground cover additionally errors in the input parameters might result in an inaccurate estimate of the eb components among several factors contributing to changes in the etr this study revealed substantial effects of these four parameters 3 4 analysis of etr variation in caatinga and agriculture the statistical comparison of the performance and correlations between the values estimated for etr using sebal and gp sebal for the two analyzed images are presented in fig 9a b respectively etr ranged from 0 to 6 mm these values are consistent with the findings reported by silva et al 2015a 2015b and santos et al 2017a 2017b which estimated etr for study areas with a semiarid climate in brazil a substantial variability in etr was observed on the two dates gp sebal overestimated the etr for the image captured on 5 october 2013 while in the image captured on 3 september 2013 it showed greater variability as it overestimated the lowest values 0 3 mm and underestimated the highest values 3 6 mm statistical analyses showed a good correlation ns 0 5 and r2 0 95 notably the etr generated manually and using gp sebal showed a very strong positive correlation between the estimates indicating the efficiency of the automated estimation the rmse values ranging from 0 52 to 1 21 mm indicated a good estimate between gp sebal and sebal pbias values showed overestimated values ranging from 17 to 87 indicating high values for the automated method however the comparison of the performance between the two methods proved to be acceptable with mad ranging from 0 51 to 0 93 mse ranging from 0 28 to 1 48 mape ranging from 20 to 55 and mpe ranging from 201 to 553 thus the gp sebal performed satisfactorily compared to the manual sebal these values are explained by the higher lst values that influenced the h values furthermore 2013 was one of the driest and warmest years in the whole bsar dantas e al 2020 brasil neto et al 2021 and the images used in this study were captured at the end of the dry period in that year this thermal condition and the prolongation of drought in this region influenced the increase in the rates of etr as described by silva et al 2015a 2015b costa et al 2019 and ferreira et al 2020 table 3 shows the variation in etr values for all lulc classes calculated using manual sebal and gp sebal the highest values for etr identified occurred in the water caatinga and agriculture classes the results of variations in etr between the two methods were considered close for all water caatinga and agriculture classes with etr values ranging from 0 78 to 1 16 for sebal and 0 73 1 01 for gp sebal notably the obtained values for water loss are more similar to those obtained in the studies by dos santos et al 2010 sun et al 2011 costa et al 2019 and vanomark et al 2018 in contrast the exposed soil class presented a variation ranging from 6 23 to 2 82 for sebal and gp sebal respectively the values estimated using gp sebal were similar to those calculated using the manual sebal pu 3 therefore gp sebal should be considered a promising tool for the determination of etr in the bsar the results also showed that the standard deviation ranged from 1 3 to 1 94 mm for sebal and was lower than gp sebal values for all lulc classes fig 10a b show the spatial distribution of etr values estimated using gp sebal for the two images analyzed in the present study the results showed that etr ranged from 0 to 10 mm where the greatest water losses occurred in the southern and northern portions of the study area santos et al 2017a 2017b and dos santos et al 2020 also estimated etr values similar to those obtained in this study the analysis of the etr values is critically related to the understanding of the vegetation characteristics and agricultural cultivation cycle at the time the image was obtained because they are influenced by the variation in the climate and the land use throughout the year exposed soil has the lowest etr values in the image which are less than 50 of that of the next lowest class these results are potentially attributed to the shallow depth of the roots of the vegetation and the characteristics of the rooting of the undergrowth in the study area 4 conclusions this study evaluated the applicability of the gp sebal algorithm to calculate etr for dry forest vegetation caatinga and agricultural areas in the bsar this algorithm minimized the occurrence of errors and is considered a useful tool for estimating etr the results of the comparison of the spatiotemporal variability in the eb and statistical analyses are excellent for all analyzed eb components and for the etr the results of the statistical indices obtained here are satisfactory we conclude that the main difference between gp sebal and sebal is in the speed of processing especially in the iterative process which demands time and attention from the analyst sebal is a longer process that requires more attention from the researcher we save time using gp sebal as we are able to complete the processing of an image within 5 min we conclude that the gp sebal algorithm is highly efficient at estimating etr for agriculture and caatinga vegetation areas in the bsar finally the efficiency of gp sebal in estimating the eb automatically and quickly using an algorithm written in the python language and executed in free software such as grass gis is worth highlighting this algorithm should be considered a valuable tool for analyzing the eb and etr components in a short period of time the gp sebal could be applied in any part of the bsar with high precision and less error allowing a better estimation of regional etr that will provide consistent information to decision makers for more efficient water management in fruit production the results highlight that the parameters g and h followed by le and rn are more sensitive to changes in gp sebal and manual sebal estimates thus the objective of this study to calculate and evaluate the eb accuracy and etr using gp sebal for dry forest vegetation caatinga and agricultural areas in the bsar was achieved

10135,real evapotranspiration etr plays a key role in water balance especially for dry forest vegetation caatinga and irrigated agricultural areas as is the case in the petrolina region located in the brazilian semiarid region bsar population growth increases the need for food and the use of water resources which are scarcer in semiarid regions thus knowledge of the energy balance eb and radiative balance are indispensable for the management of water resources especially in irrigated agricultural areas currently one of the biggest challenges in the application of algorithms for estimating etr based on satellite images is the calibration of the eb the goal of this study was to evaluate the applicability of geographic resources analysis support system grass python surface eb algorithm for land gp sebal to calculate etr for caatinga vegetation and agricultural areas in the bsar gp sebal was applied to two images from landsat 8 obtained in 2013 and compared with manual sebal and observed data in this study kappa coefficient accuracy was used to compare the ground truth data and predicted land use and land cover the performance of algorithms in determining the eb components land surface temperature lst net radiation rn soil heat flux g latent heat flux le sensible heat flux h and etr were compared with statistical indices and uncertainty percentages pus were calculated in addition a sensitivity analysis using a deviation of 30 w m2 with an interval of 5 w m2 was used to analyze the sensitivity of etr the results showed a strong correlation between gp sebal and manual sebal for etr lst rn lh and h the values suggest the regularity of estimating the eb in an automated manner the results indicate a small pu difference in the estimated etr values calculated using gp sebal and sebal for two images of 10 87 and 20 11 for caatinga vegetation and 15 01 and 35 16 for agriculture respectively we conclude that gp sebal is an efficient automated algorithm for estimating etr that uses a less complex process with a lower incidence of errors and considerably faster execution time than classical applications of sebal keywords automated evapotranspiration caatinga vegetation agriculture grass gis python language sebal brazil 1 introduction among the hydrological variables real evapotranspiration etr is the one that plays an important role in the water balance of semiarid regions xiang et al 2020 evapotranspiration et is necessary to understand the behavior of the hydrological processes and is fundamental for water management especially in regions with semiarid climates etr knowledge and control are vital for better agricultural production the brazilian semiarid region bsar is characterized by water scarcity and a high rate of etr in most of its area although places with an abundance of surface water such as the irrigated agricultural region of petrolina also exist barros et al 2015 currently the demands for food and the generation of wealth by agriculture are important reasons for understanding etr the irrigated agricultural region of petrolina is responsible for substantial food production and is influenced by the water from the são francisco river which irrigates approximately 100 000 ha of cropland cabral júnior et al 2019 et accounts for most of the water consumption across the northeastern region of brazil the allocation of water resources in the petrolina region is of enormous practical importance to ensure fruit production in addition understanding the et helps prepare the water management policies designed to address effects of climate variability land use land cover lulc and future climate changes on local etr however few studies have applied surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal to the bsar to analyze etr in agriculture and caatinga vegetation silva et al 2019 veloso et al 2020 dos santos et al 2020 mainly using an open source script and free geographic information system software actually studies performing simulation and validation of etr are scarce in the context of the assessment of the land surface radiation components for the bsar ferreira et al 2020 several methods have been developed for acquiring etr including bowen s ratio turbulent vortex covariance techniques and scintillometers oliveira et al 2014 teixeira et al 2007 all of these procedures are expensive and their extrapolation to other areas makes the techniques imprecise and impracticable however these methods consider only small areas mahmoud and alazba 2016a 2016b in contrast the use of remote sensing products has been used around the world santos et al 2019 garrido rubio et al 2020 thus etr estimates for large areas are possible based on remote sensing applications energy balance eb algorithms have been applied worldwide lee and kim 2016 and among the more frequently used are the surface energy balance index sebi menenti and choudhury 1993 sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution using internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 the two source energy balance tseb timmermans et al 2007 and et watch wu et al 2008 a large number of studies on the usage of these algorithms and others are available in the literature zhang et al 2020 undoubtedly among these eb algorithms sebal is the most widely acknowledged validated and applied around the world mhawej et al 2020a recently sebal has been applied in precision agriculture and numerous hydrological applications bhattarai et al 2016 mhawej et al 2020b sun et al 2011 losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 evaluated the application of metric sebal and sebs algorithms to the evaporation in the amirkabir reservoir rahimzadegan and janani 2019 analyzed etr using the sebal algorithm based on landsat 8 satellite imagery for pistachio crop in brazil teixeira et al 2009a reviewed sebal input parameters using combined satellite data and field measurements to examine the application of various sebal steps in the low middle são francisco river basin teixeira et al 2009b applied sebal at the regional scale within the bsar to analyze etr and water productivity santos et al 2017a 2017b estimated etr for several land covers in a typical watershed of the bsar ferreira et al 2020 estimated net radiation and its components in contrasting lulc using remote sensing products for an agricultural area in the bsar we highlight that the acquisition of data for eb estimation by remote sensing has a high degree of complexity requiring much time of the researcher and data for calibration studies of automated calibration that really show their effectiveness have been performed bhattarai liu 2019 silva et al 2019 jaafar ahmad 2020 and new applications are encouraged in last few years the number of studies on automation and improvements in sebal has increased considerably bhattarai et al 2017a developed an automated algorithm for selecting the anchor pixel in the sebal and metric algorithms silva et al 2019 created an automatic algorithm to calculate etr from modis products using statistical criteria for endmember pixel selection mhawej et al 2020b proposed a dynamic calibration approach for a better et estimation using sebal automated in the python language in the sebal algorithm the various stages of modeling especially the process of choosing the hot and cold anchor pixels in an iterative process of calculating the eb are an important step in estimating etr bhattarai and liu 2019 according to french et al 2015 the process of automating sebal might extend avenues for multi model ensemble etr predictions on a large scale when the application of a single model is often challenging given this scenario this study presents geographic resources analysis support system grass python sebal gp sebal a new python based methodology for the application of fully automated versions of sebal to landsat images which was adapted for regions lacking soil related datasets gp sebal was applied in a totally free environment and contributes an application that facilitates fusion cloud correction and the automated choice of pixels based on the ground cover 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area the study area chosen for this analysis was the garças river basin this basin is located in the caatinga biome region in brazil more precisely at the latitude coordinates 8 10 s and 8 80 s and longitude coordinates 40 80 w and 39 70 w fig 1 and has area of 4094 km2 the petrolina juazeiro agricultural complex is located in this basin within the sub middle são francisco river basin the main economic activity of this region is fruit production the region has the natural conditions necessary for the development of this activity combining insolation and heat levels with the dry climate of the bsar and favorable soil for irrigation these factors enable several annual harvests and higher quality products giving it a competitive position in the global fruit trade oliveira filho et al 2014 caatinga vegetation is a steppe savanna with bush and dense canopy and this vegetation is typical of the bsar the more common species are in the genera spondias mimosa and aspidosperma de lima 2019 mean annual rainfall in the region of the garças river basin has ranged from 500 to 800 mm over the last 30 years and the rainy season in the region is between january and april brito et al 2021 the average annual relative humidity is 70 and the mean daily temperature is 29 c silva et al 2005 2 2 orbital images and lulc classification land use and land cover lulc classification of 30 m landsat 8 oli tirs images orbit 217 and point 66 captured on 3 september 2013 were retrieved from the united states geological survey usgs as described by cunha et al 2021 this image was chosen because it represents the lulc during the dry period which is the most common condition for this region throughout the year in this study the maximum likelihood method was applied for the lulc classification the maximum likelihood classifier is a method based on statistical classification approach in which class signatures are allocated to have normal distributions this method was used because it provides estimators with a reasonable intuitive basis and many suitable statistical properties and has been extensively used worldwide with good results the fusion of the landsat 5 tm with the landsat 8 oli tirs panchromatic 8 band image was applied to reduce the uncertainties of image classification fusion was performed using the gdal pansharpen tool in the gdal algorithm appel et al 2018 thus with the fusion the images changed from 30 to 15 m allowing a better lulc classification in this study five lulcs were classified a water bodies b agriculture croplands and pasture c exposed soil and d caatinga vegetation formed by shrub vegetation and herbaceous vegetation this vegetation has the characteristics of deciduous xerophytic shrubs vegetation and open trees the terrain digital elevation model was obtained and processed using the method reported by silva et al 2019 the meteorological data used here were collected from the bebedouro agrometeorological station http www cpatsa embrapa br 8080 servicos dadosmet ceb dia html located in petrolina city 2 3 accuracy assessment of the lulc classified image the use of criteria to evaluate and compare the accuracy of thematic mapping is a fundamental technique to describe the quality of image classification according to congalton 1991 an error matrix is useful to apply a series of descriptive and analytical statistical techniques the estimation of the lulc classification consistency was tested by determining the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient k the overall accuracy is estimated by splitting the sum of the main diagonal of the error matrix x ii by the total number of collected samples n 1 o c i 1 x i i n in which x ii is the value in row i and column i and c is the number of classes the accuracy of a class is shown by the producer and user accuracies producer accuracy is directed to samples that have not been properly classified into the correct classes and omitted from their appropriate category and user accuracy is directed to the chance that a classified cell in the image symbolizes that class this statistic is calculated as follows 2 κ n c i 1 x i i c i 1 x i x i n 2 c i 1 x i x i in which κ is the kappa statistic x i is the sum of row i and x i is the sum of column i of the confusion matrix in this study the classification validation process was based on the confusion matrix which also used the user s accuracy producer s accuracy omission and commission measures as described by silva et al 2020 the classified map was statistically tested with random validation samples collected from orbital imagery and samples verified in the field an independent collection of points of each lulc class was used to validate the classified classes that remained unchanged in the analyzed image a group of 1000 samples was randomly selected after image fusion and checked in the field 2 4 determination of net radiation and etr two 30 m landsat 8 oli tirs orbit 217 and point 66 satellite images captured on 3 september 2013 doy 246 and 5 october 2013 doy 278 were used the sebal algorithm was used as described by coelho et al 2017 and bhattarai et al 2017a 2017b to calculate the components of the eb the net radiation is calculated as follows 3 r n r s 1 α sup r o r om 1 ε 0 r om where rn is the instantaneous net radiation w m2 rs is incident short wave radiation αsup is corrected surface albedo ro is factor that corresponds to the longwave radiation emitted by each pixel of the image rom is longwave radiation emitted by the atmosphere toward each pixel of the image and εo corresponds to the emissivity values of each pixel of the image the soil heat flux g is reported in w m2 and obtained using eq 4 bastiaanssen 2000 4 g lst α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 0 98 ndvi 4 r n where lst is the land surface temperature c ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index and α is surface albedo sensible heat flux h in w m2 is estimated based on wind speed and lst using internal calibration of the temperature difference close to the surface between two levels close to the surface with eq 5 which was proposed by bastiaanssen et al 1998 5 h ρ c p a bt s a r where ρ is the specific mass of air cp is the specific heat of air at a constant pressure of 1004 j kg k a and b represent the calibration constants of the temperature difference between two levels z1 and z2 and ar is the aerodynamic resistance of heat transport s m latent heat flux le in w m2 was obtained by calculating the difference between rn g and h eq 6 bastiaanssen et al 1998 mohamed et al 2004 this parameter was calculated for the moment of the passage of the satellite in the study area 6 l e r n g h the first step in obtaining the values of etr mm day is to evaluate the instantaneous evaporative fraction ef using eq 7 bastiaanssen et al 1998 finally daily evapotranspiration is calculated using eq 8 7 e f l e r n g 8 etr 0 035 e f r n 2 5 automated algorithm implementation and evaluation an open source python 3 7 script was executed in grass software to estimate the etr this integration was named grass python sebal gp sebal and was developed to automate etr value retrieval based on a computer software library specialized in many computational functions such as vector reading and raster image processing and writing this study compared the manual application of sebal described in the study of bastiaanssen 1995 with the proposed gp sebal algorithm in this study the values of a set 1000 sample points of eb components were extracted which were selected randomly gp sebal estimated etr and saved the results of all steps in different ascii files with an execution time of approximately 5 min on average when saving and less than 1 min without saving all results in this step gp sebal was run using a computer with a 3 30 ghz intel dell processor e3 1240 cpu 8 gb of ram and a 64 bit windows 10 operating system the classical sebal algorithm was created while considering the usually utilized theory that etr can be calculated from the residual term of the surface eb and determines rn and g directly using input data nevertheless the application of sebal and the adequate choice of hot and cold pixels is the most complex stage in the application of this algorithm because sebal requires a modeler with a substantial experience in energy fluxes and etr moreover a large number of working hours is necessary for image processing using manual sebal in addition to all these steps needed for the etr simulation a risk of human errors in the sebal application exists allen et al 2002 for instance for the application of sebal a strong manual process for the selection of the endmember in the image is required silva et al 2019 the difference between gp sebal and sebal methods is that the etr calculation processes are automated using open source and fast processing moreover this automated algorithm contains a an internal cloud removal process that b generates accurate and acceptable pixel values in some shaded areas or images with clouds c uses the atmospherically corrected satellite images to calculate vegetation indices d performs pixel resampling from 30 to 15 m e image segmentation and supervised image classification and f selects the cold and hot pixels fig 2 shows the general flowchart of the study the following input data are necessary to apply gp sebal a an orbital image b digital elevation model c latitude and longitude data d meteorological data e wind speed f air temperature g day and month the image was captured and h global average daily solar radiation data in w m2 in the first step the algorithm corrects the images radiance and reflectance next soil adjusted vegetation index savi leaf area index lai normalized difference vegetation index ndvi albedo lst emissivity rn g h and le are automatically calculated then masks are created that identify all the hot and cold pixels in the images based on the ndvi and lst values due to the complexity of the study area caatinga vegetation and the choice of the cold and hot pixels this study used manual selection of cold and hot pixels this selection is based on criteria of lulc classification lst and albedo values the pixels defined as cold were those that showed the highest albedo values and lowest temperatures in the image the hot pixels were those with the highest lst values usually pixels classified as exposed soil after the selection of cold and hot pixels the iterative process is performed where the algorithm performs the adjustment seeking stability when the gp sebal identifies stability the h le rn and ef are calculated and finally the daily etr is obtained 2 6 observed energy fluxes in this study energy flow data were used for calibration and comparison between manual sebal and gp sebal results the data were collected in an automated micrometeorological tower located at the coordinates 9 05 s and 40 19 w at a 350 m altitude this tower is equipped with electronic sensors to quantify the components of the radiation energy and other environmental parameters the tower is 16 m high with two measurement systems low and high frequency the low frequency system measures the components of energy components of radiation lst relative humidity and precipitation the high frequency system performs measurements at 10 hz and is composed of a three dimensional sonic anemometer to measure fluctuations in wind speed and air temperature a thermistor was installed on the ground to measure lst rn h and le parameters which were compared with estimated data obtained using sebal and gp sebal the heat flow in the soil was measured using a flow meter an infrared gas analyzer is also installed in the tower to obtain the water vapor concentration the experimental data from the caatinga vegetation area and the methodology for collecting and processing the data were reported by souza et al 2015 carvalho et al 2018 and ferreira et al 2020 this experiment was carried out between january and december 2013 in an area of 600 ha of caatinga vegetation that has been preserved for over 35 years the experimental area has soil of the eutrophic yellow argisol type the vegetation is caatinga vegetation composed of arboreal shrubby hyperxerophilous and deciduous species with small leaves and a height ranging from 4 to 7 m 2 7 performance sensitivity analysis and uncertainty the developed automated approach was evaluated based on its capacity to accurately predict the performance of the eb and etr between sebal and gp sebal thus commonly used model evaluation criteria such as nash sutcliffe ns percent bias pbias root mean square errors rmse mean absolute deviation mad mean square error mse mean absolute percentage error mape mean percentage error mpe coefficient of correlation r and coefficient of determination r2 were used as proposed by rahimzadegan and janani 2019 and bhattarai et al 2017a variability measures were also analyzed to test the variations between the results obtained manually and with gp sebal in this study a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effect of each parameter surface albedo lst rn g h and le on etr estimates using the approach proposed by timmermans et al 2007 and also used by faridatul et al 2020 9 etr i s m s gp s gp 100 where etri is the sensitivity of the model to an input i sm is predicted by the model when the input energy flux equals its reference value and sgp is the increase and decrease in values of eb components after analyzing the sensitivity the values of the input energy fluxes were modified to compute sm and the sensitivity to etri was defined a change of 30 w m2 30 w m2 to 30 w m2 with an interval of 5 w m2 was applied to test the sensitivity of etr estimation uncertainty calculations for the seven eb components were conducted to quantify the adjustment between gp sebal and manual sebal the obtained results were compared with the results obtained by the two methods in this study the percentage uncertainty percentage up was used to investigate the uncertainty of each eb component evaluating the gp sebal forecast uncertainty is important to know the quality of this algorithm in predicting etr the percentage of measurements provides empirical evidence that the estimate is realistic 3 results and discussion 3 1 accuracy and evaluation of the lulc classification the spatial distribution of the lulc classes for 2013 are shown in fig 3 this basin consists mainly of the caatinga vegetation 75 68 and exposed soil 23 02 classes which are typical of the caatinga biome in the region the agriculture class occupies a total area of 52 60 km2 1 28 a large part of which is irrigated and depends substantially on water controlled by et the agriculture class is predominantly occupied by fruit production in croplands and pasture formed by small areas of cattle farms the agriculture class is responsible for the principal economic activity of the region the accuracy statistics for the classification results and the results of commission and omission of the image are shown in table 1 the classification accuracy ranged from 76 7 to 83 3 and the kappa coefficient ranged from 88 4 to 88 6 the overall kappa coefficient and overall accuracy calculated for the whole image were equal to 88 9 and 77 5 respectively the results of commission and omission obtained show that all classes had good adjustments in the classification these results are good for a basin located in the caatinga biome where the vegetation is rarefied dry and are similar to those obtained by santos et al 2017a 2017b in contrast portions of irrigated agriculture and larger vegetation shrub vegetation are located mainly on the banks of the rivers in the region where more water is stored and the soils are deeper dantas et al 2020 3 2 comparison of sebal gp sebal and observed data fig 4a l present the correlations calculated between estimated values for eb components from two images using gp sebal and sebal fig 4a b show a statistical comparison of the performance of sebal and gp sebal in estimating surface albedo values the albedo values show a good fit between the values obtained manually and using the automated algorithm for all classes of lulc the results of the statistical indices show excellent adjustments with r2 0 97 and an rmse of 0 01 for the two images indicating a strong positive correlation and good agreement between the estimated values however the results of pbias show that gp sebal underestimates the automated values in relation to those of sebal 1 92 the values obtained for lst fig 4c d also show an excellent correlation with r2 and ns 0 99 and rmse ranging from 0 13 to 0 16 indicating a good estimate of this component by gp sebal tests were also applied with the pbias resulting in a slight overestimation ranging from 0 013 to 0 03 the rn values estimated using sebal and gp sebal are shown in fig 4e f the results were excellent r2 0 94 ns 0 94 rmse 9 32 w m2 and pbias ranging 0 03 0 58 indicating a slight overestimation of the estimated values using the automated algorithm fig 4g h show a comparison of the performance of sebal and gp sebal in estimating values for g the statistical behavior of g is also considered very good r2 0 88 however the results showed an overestimation with pbias ranging from 0 10 to 1 85 for the two images fig 4i j shows a statistical comparison between sebal and gp sebal for h values substantial differences in the estimates of h are obtained using the two methods because gp sebal underestimated the values compared with the manual sebal this difference is evidenced by the variation in the results of pbias mad mse mape and mpe in contrast the r and r2 indices are considered good the values for the correlation of le fig 4k l are also considered excellent statistically r2 0 97 however the results showed an overestimation of the values obtained using gp sebal the values of mad mse mape and mpe varied subtly and are considered satisfactory table 2 shows the results of the comparison between estimated energy flux values obtained using sebal and gp sebal for each lulc class pbias results show that the rn values for the caatinga exposed soil and agriculture classes are underestimated while it is overestimated for the water class the results of the comparison for g show mad values ranging from 1 3 to 2 8 w m2 in the image captured on 3 september 2013 while in the image captured on 5 october 2013 the values range from 4 7 to 9 9 w m2 the pbias results show that gp sebal underestimated the values in all lulc in the image captured on 3 september 2013 in the image captured on 5 october 2013 the gp sebal overestimated the g values for the caatinga exposed soil and agriculture classes the results of h highlight a greater error in the agriculture class while the lowest values of rmse are calculated for the caatinga class in both images the value of h was also slightly overestimated for the image captured on 3 september 2013 for the caatinga and exposed soil classes for le the values were underestimated in all classes in the image captured on 3 september 2013 while in the image captured on 5 october 2013 the le values were overestimated for the caatinga and agriculture classes based on these results the values of the eb components in the image captured on 5 october 2013 show greater variability than the image captured on 3 september 2013 based on the mad mape and rmse values fig 5 shows the uncertainty percentage between gp sebal and sebal for each lulc for the two analyzed images the pu was higher for the image captured on 5 october 2013 higher h values were registered for caatinga and exposed soil classes in this image ranging from 35 to 77 according to sebal and from 46 to 36 using gp sebal higher g values were obtained for the agriculture and exposed soil classes the highest g values were estimated in the exposed soil class and also occurred in the image captured on 5 october 2013 the lowest values for g were recorded in caatinga areas ranging from 2 to 8 in accordance with the results obtained by arraes et al 2012 and atasevera et al 2013 the lowest rn values were obtained in the caatinga and agriculture areas with values 20 while the areas without vegetation cover showed the highest values for rn with values ranging from 25 to 30 in the regions without vegetation radiation is released more quickly helping increase the air temperature in these areas for areas with vegetation the release of absorbed radiation occurs more slowly during the day causing rn to remain elevated lins et al 2017 silva et al 2016 the highest le values were obtained for exposed soil in two images while the lowest values were obtained for the caatinga and agriculture classes the h and g components had the highest pu values in the image captured on 3 september 2013 and h and g parameters showed the highest uncertainties in the image captured on 5 october 2013 in most comparisons the sebal values showed greater uncertainties than the automated method these results are similar to those reported by bhattarai and liu 2019 silva et al 2019 bhattarai et al 2017a and faridatul et al 2020 moreover rn and le had the lowest uncertainties in all classes except for exposed soil in the image captured on 5 october 2013 small discrepancies were observed between the results of gp sebal and the manual sebal the uncertainties between the two analyzed methods are considered small fig 6 shows observed hourly data for rn h and le and estimated values obtained using sebal and gp sebal for the two images analyzed in this study the results of this comparison show that the gp sebal performed well and that the image captured on 5 october 2013 showed greater variation and the highest values for rn h and le gp sebal performed well compared to the manual sebal and the observed data gp sebal overestimated the values of rn and h in relation to those observed on 3 september 2013 ranging from 13 to 25 while the le was underestimated by 26 the sebal results showed that the values for rn h and le were 32 42 10 95 and 8 41 respectively the difference in the values obtained in the two images shows the high variability of the eb components in this region as also highlighted by bezerra et al 2015 silva et al 2015a 2015b and coelho et al 2017 however gp sebal estimated the values of rn h and le that were similar to the data observed in the micrometeorological towers these results highlight that gp sebal was able to adequately represent the values of rn h and le in both images and that gp sebal should be considered a useful tool to estimate eb components in the bsar these values show the substantial variability of etr in this region and the difficulty of automated algorithms in estimating good results nevertheless the values obtained using gp sebal are considered very good 3 3 mapping of eb components and sensitivity analysis the progress of techniques and biophysical modeling to calculate eb components from orbital image data has been used extensively over the past three decades mainly in regional and global studies such as those monitoring land cover change fig 7a l show the geographic distribution of the biophysical parameters estimated using gp sebal for the garças river basin in the two images fig 7a b show the regional distribution of surface albedo the surface albedo values showed substantial variability ranging from 5 to 55 which was also reported by silva et al 2015a 2015b these values are related to the characteristics of climate and the caatinga vegetation cover that have the capacity to become a verdant green vegetation after rain events fig 7c d show the maps of lst over the basin with values ranging from 22 to 37 c as expected the highest lst values were concentrated in the exposed soil class the results show coherence between the different lulc classes except for water which had a small difference between the estimated values according to santos et al 2017a 2017b the rn values show a high variability ranging from 200 to 700 w m2 and high values occurred in all portions of the basin fig 7e f similar results have been reported by borges et al 2015 and lafayette et al 2019 fig 7g h show the g values which indicated that the highest values occurred in the study area ranging from 40 to 240 w m2 higher values occurred in the northern portion of the basin which contains a greater amount of exposed soil while the high values occurred in southern portion in the second image fig 7i j show the spatial distribution of h estimates for the study area the h values ranged from 40 to 260 w m2 this parameter is considered the main parameter in the eb process calculated using the sebal algorithm bastiaanssen et al 1998 for reasons explained above this parameter showed greater variation than the other parameters in study area notably the spatial distribution of the highest values of the parameter h are similar to the highest values of g fig 7k l show the map le estimated using gp sebal with values ranging from 20 to 580 w m2 the estimated g and le values are similar to the values obtained by teixeira et al 2009a 2009b we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of eb components on etr fig 8 shows the sensitivity of etr to changes in rn g h and le the input values of eb components were disturbed and the sensitivity to these components has been listed the results of the etr sensitivity analysis with changes in the rn values are shown in fig 8a b notably the rn values positively correlated with the etr thus an increase or decrease of 30 w m2 in rn results in the greatest change in the etr moreover a greater sensitivity of the parameters rn g and h was observed in the image captured on 3 september 2013 while only the parameter le showed greater sensitivity in the image captured on 5 october 2013 the results showed a positive linear correlation between g and etr with the largest relative change in etr 30 fig 8c d the results showed a positive linear correlation between the changes in h with etr fig 8e f as the positive changes were constant for the results obtained using gp sebal for the two images the results showed greater sensitivity of values calculated using sebal as the percent change increases the results of gp sebal showed a greater variation only in changes greater than 25 while in the other intervals the variation is constant for h a similar behavior was also perceived for g a decrease of 30 w m2 in h results in an etr variation of approximately 10 20 the changes in the le parameter and its relationship to etr are shown in fig 8g h the results revealed a positive correlation where an increase or decrease of 30 w m2 in le results in a change of more than 10 20 in the etr estimate notably etr is sensitive to changes in le but presents a lower relative change than for changes in the other parameters in the image captured on 3 september 2013 unlike the results obtained for the image captured on 5 october 2013 etr was also highly sensitive to changes in g based on changes in rn h and le according to faridatul et al 2020 the sensitivity varies for energy flows because it depends on the type of ground cover additionally errors in the input parameters might result in an inaccurate estimate of the eb components among several factors contributing to changes in the etr this study revealed substantial effects of these four parameters 3 4 analysis of etr variation in caatinga and agriculture the statistical comparison of the performance and correlations between the values estimated for etr using sebal and gp sebal for the two analyzed images are presented in fig 9a b respectively etr ranged from 0 to 6 mm these values are consistent with the findings reported by silva et al 2015a 2015b and santos et al 2017a 2017b which estimated etr for study areas with a semiarid climate in brazil a substantial variability in etr was observed on the two dates gp sebal overestimated the etr for the image captured on 5 october 2013 while in the image captured on 3 september 2013 it showed greater variability as it overestimated the lowest values 0 3 mm and underestimated the highest values 3 6 mm statistical analyses showed a good correlation ns 0 5 and r2 0 95 notably the etr generated manually and using gp sebal showed a very strong positive correlation between the estimates indicating the efficiency of the automated estimation the rmse values ranging from 0 52 to 1 21 mm indicated a good estimate between gp sebal and sebal pbias values showed overestimated values ranging from 17 to 87 indicating high values for the automated method however the comparison of the performance between the two methods proved to be acceptable with mad ranging from 0 51 to 0 93 mse ranging from 0 28 to 1 48 mape ranging from 20 to 55 and mpe ranging from 201 to 553 thus the gp sebal performed satisfactorily compared to the manual sebal these values are explained by the higher lst values that influenced the h values furthermore 2013 was one of the driest and warmest years in the whole bsar dantas e al 2020 brasil neto et al 2021 and the images used in this study were captured at the end of the dry period in that year this thermal condition and the prolongation of drought in this region influenced the increase in the rates of etr as described by silva et al 2015a 2015b costa et al 2019 and ferreira et al 2020 table 3 shows the variation in etr values for all lulc classes calculated using manual sebal and gp sebal the highest values for etr identified occurred in the water caatinga and agriculture classes the results of variations in etr between the two methods were considered close for all water caatinga and agriculture classes with etr values ranging from 0 78 to 1 16 for sebal and 0 73 1 01 for gp sebal notably the obtained values for water loss are more similar to those obtained in the studies by dos santos et al 2010 sun et al 2011 costa et al 2019 and vanomark et al 2018 in contrast the exposed soil class presented a variation ranging from 6 23 to 2 82 for sebal and gp sebal respectively the values estimated using gp sebal were similar to those calculated using the manual sebal pu 3 therefore gp sebal should be considered a promising tool for the determination of etr in the bsar the results also showed that the standard deviation ranged from 1 3 to 1 94 mm for sebal and was lower than gp sebal values for all lulc classes fig 10a b show the spatial distribution of etr values estimated using gp sebal for the two images analyzed in the present study the results showed that etr ranged from 0 to 10 mm where the greatest water losses occurred in the southern and northern portions of the study area santos et al 2017a 2017b and dos santos et al 2020 also estimated etr values similar to those obtained in this study the analysis of the etr values is critically related to the understanding of the vegetation characteristics and agricultural cultivation cycle at the time the image was obtained because they are influenced by the variation in the climate and the land use throughout the year exposed soil has the lowest etr values in the image which are less than 50 of that of the next lowest class these results are potentially attributed to the shallow depth of the roots of the vegetation and the characteristics of the rooting of the undergrowth in the study area 4 conclusions this study evaluated the applicability of the gp sebal algorithm to calculate etr for dry forest vegetation caatinga and agricultural areas in the bsar this algorithm minimized the occurrence of errors and is considered a useful tool for estimating etr the results of the comparison of the spatiotemporal variability in the eb and statistical analyses are excellent for all analyzed eb components and for the etr the results of the statistical indices obtained here are satisfactory we conclude that the main difference between gp sebal and sebal is in the speed of processing especially in the iterative process which demands time and attention from the analyst sebal is a longer process that requires more attention from the researcher we save time using gp sebal as we are able to complete the processing of an image within 5 min we conclude that the gp sebal algorithm is highly efficient at estimating etr for agriculture and caatinga vegetation areas in the bsar finally the efficiency of gp sebal in estimating the eb automatically and quickly using an algorithm written in the python language and executed in free software such as grass gis is worth highlighting this algorithm should be considered a valuable tool for analyzing the eb and etr components in a short period of time the gp sebal could be applied in any part of the bsar with high precision and less error allowing a better estimation of regional etr that will provide consistent information to decision makers for more efficient water management in fruit production the results highlight that the parameters g and h followed by le and rn are more sensitive to changes in gp sebal and manual sebal estimates thus the objective of this study to calculate and evaluate the eb accuracy and etr using gp sebal for dry forest vegetation caatinga and agricultural areas in the bsar was achieved

10136,to address the twin issues of food and nutrition security the focus of agricultural production should be shifted from biomass productivity to nutritional gains the objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of conversion from furrow to drip irrigation on the yield components water productivity wp nutritional yield ny and nutritional water productivity nwp of tomato during two consecutive growth cycles 2017 2018 in a greenhouse in the arid area of northwest china results showed that the environment under drip irrigation was more beneficial to the accumulation of phytochemicals and the formation of total antioxidant activity in tomato fruits which also significantly increased the nwp however the notable decline in single fruit fresh weight reducing the tomato yield significantly under drip irrigation in summer while the wp and ny were similar to furrow irrigation this indicated that the ny of tomato was mainly determined by the fruit yield while the nwp was strongly affected by the mass concentration of nutrients in contrast no difference was found in the single fruit fresh weight and tomato yield between drip and furrow irrigation in winter which related to the similar environmental conditions while the wp and ny were significantly higher under drip irrigation in summary the potential and water use efficiency in nutrient production of tomato were enhanced under drip irrigation and the improvement of fruit quality can offset the negative effect of yield reduction therefore drip irrigation can achieve a good balance between the high yield and superior quality of tomato fruits meanwhile reducing the pressure on the environment caused by horticultural production we propose that the drip irrigation should be employed in the greenhouse in arid areas for tomato production and the concepts of ny and nwp can be further applied to other horticultural crops with high nutritional value keywords irrigation method environmental stress fruit quality nutritional yield nutritional water productivity 1 introduction food security exists when all people at all times have physical social and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life fao 1996 in the past decades the green revolution 2 0 greatly improved agricultural productivity and food availability hence maintained global food security godecke et al 2018 pingali 2012 however more than half of the world population is currently still affected by undernutrition vinoth and ravindhran 2017 which may adversely influence physical and mental condition of children decrease human immunity and increase risk of chronical diseases govender et al 2016 the nutrition insecurity bringing a huge burden to global public health socio economic and human well being which is more serious than food insecurity martin et al 2011 crops are the main source of essential nutrients for the growth and development of human beings and improving crop quality is a sustainable and vital approach to address global nutrition insecurity vinoth and ravindhran 2017 however the high accumulation of phytochemicals as well as crop biomass cannot be achieved simultaneously under any environmental scenarios bumgarner et al 2012 thereby yield increases usually accompany degradation of quality graham et al 2018 therefore there is a trade off between the crop yield and quality however studies on agricultural water use crop productivity nutrition and human health conducted by agronomists or nutritionists were usually isolated nyathi et al 2018 in order to cut the gordian knot of food and nutrition security water agriculture nutrition human health nexus should be emphasized and further studied bumgarner et al 2012 and renault and wallender 2000 were first to propose concepts of nutrient yield ny and nutrient water productivity nwp respectively ny combines crop yield and nutrients mass concentration to calculate the amount of functional components produced per unit area which can effectively compare the actual nutritional value of crops under different production systems graham et al 2018 nwp refers to the amount of nutrients produced per unit amount of water blas et al 2019 and reflects the efficiency of crops in converting available water resources into nutrient yield zhang et al 2018 by using ny and nwp the focus of agricultural production can be altered from increasing yield to improving quality which is beneficial to ensure both global food and nutrition security however only a few studies are focused on ny or nwp for example for grain legumes chibarabada et al 2017 wheat moreira ascarrunz et al 2016 sweet potato nyathi et al 2019a twenty vegetables widely utilized in sub saharan africa nyathi et al 2019b and a comparative study about mediterranean diet in spain blas et al 2019 tomato is one of the important horticultural crops which can provide nutritious and healthy food its high number of functional components including carotenoids vitamins phenols cellulose as well as mineral elements ripoll et al 2016 and not at least its attractive flavor make tomato one of the most popular vegetable crops with the world wide largest vegetable cropping area nangare et al 2016 due to its wide application in the human diet minor changes in the concentration yield or productivity of nutrients may have a substantial impact on the nutritional value of people however to the best of our knowledge no experimental research have been reported that related ny and nwp under different agronomic or irrigation managements of greenhouse tomato the solar greenhouse industry is well developed in northwest china which is an arid zone and therefore facing serious problems of water shortage wang et al 2011 although drip irrigation is strongly promoted by the government to save water furrow irrigation is currently still the common practice among local greenhouse growers one of the reasons was that yield reduction was reported under drip irrigation in the greenhouse however organoleptic quality nutritional quality and antioxidant activity of tomato fruits generally improved compared with furrow irrigation according to the reportes of our research group previously therefore the yield and water productivity of tomato in the greenhouse as well as the ny and nwp of phytochemicals and total antioxidant activity are evaluated under drip and furrow irrigation in this research to answer scientific questions including 1 can improvement of tomato fruit quality offset the negative effect of yield reduction under drip irrigation 2 how does conversion of irrigation method impact human nutrition farmland and water resource utilization in horticultural production 2 materials and methods 2 1 general situation of the experimental site the experiment was carried out in a non heated solar greenhouse located in the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university from april 20 to august 19 2017 summer cycle and from november 1 2017 to april 9 2018 winter cycle the experimental station is located near wuwei city gansu province china e 102 50 50 n 37 52 20 a s l 1580 m which has a typical continental temperate climate the solar greenhouse employed in our study is on an east west orientation 70 m long and 8 5 m wide with the effective planting area of 360 m2 more technical information about this greenhouse can be found in li et al 2020 the soil used in the greenhouse experiment is classified as irrigated desert soil siltigic orthic anthrosols composed of 12 2 clay 60 3 silt and 27 5 sand for summer and winter cycle the average soil dry bulk density of the planned wetted soil layer 0 50 cm was 1 56 0 03 and 1 58 0 04 g cm3 respectively and the field soil water capacity θ fc was 0 27 0 01 and 0 26 0 00 cm3 cm3 respectively the soil surface was covered with clear 0 05 mm polyethylene film to reduce soil evaporation and weed growth 2 2 crop management the tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill grown in the greenhouse was a popular local variety jinpeng 11 indeterminate type tomato seedlings were transplanted to plots when they had four leaves april 20 2017 in summer cycle and november 1 2017 in winter cycle with the row spacing of 0 7 m wide and 0 5 m narrow alternately and the interplant spacing was 0 5 m the planting density of tomato was 3 78 plants m2 for both drip and furrow irrigations the drip tape with emitter flow rate of 1 38 l h at 0 1 mpa was placed along the main stem of tomato plants for each row in the drip irrigation system and two rows of tomatoes were planted on every ridge in the furrow irrigation system as presented in fig 1 all plots were fully irrigated directly and 10 days after transplanting dat fig 2 to help the establishment of seedlings cropping period was limited to five trusses per plant and crop management fertilization pollination de leafing weeding and pest control was kept the same in both treatments 2 3 experimental design the summer experiment had two treatments i e drip irrigation di1 under mulch and furrow irrigation fi1 under mulch while in winter cycle three treatments were included drip irrigation di2 under mulch furrow irrigation fi2 under mulch and a control group ck the summer experiment was used as an example to illustrate the experimental layout fig 1 while the pattern in winter cycle was similar to it and can be found in li et al 2020 in the same experimental period the area of each treatment was equal and the adjacent plots were separated by impermeable thermal insulation materials both above and below the ground to ensure the environment was completely isolated among each compartment the water management for drip di1 di2 and furrow irrigation fi1 fi2 treatments in both cropping cycles was conducted as follows table 1 from 10 days after transplanting to the end of the growth period tomato plants were irrigated to the upper limit of irrigation that is 90 2 of θ fc once the average soil moisture content within the planned wetted soil layer 50 cm dropped to 75 2 of θ fc the value of designed soil wetting proportion p in drip irrigation equal to 0 5 was lower than that in furrow irrigation equal to 1 0 which attribute to the higher irrigation efficiency yang et al 2017 treatment ck was under drip system but the irrigation amount and schedule were the same as furrow irrigation fi2 in winter cycle the theoretical irrigation amount i mm in each irrigation event for drip and furrow irrigation plots was calculated as follows 1 i 10 p θ 1 θ 2 h 0 where h 0 is the planned depth of wetted soil layer 50 cm θ 1 is the upper limit of irrigation cm 3 c m 3 i e 90 2 of θ fc and θ 2 is the actual soil volumetric water content within the planned wetted soil layer before irrigation cm 3 c m 3 actual irrigation amount ia mm was measured by a multiple jet vane wheel water meter that installed at the header of each irrigation system the actual water consumption etc mm of tomato plants was calculated using the water balance equation as follows 2 et c i a s where s is the change in soil water storage over a period time mm can be calculated as follows 3 s 10 θ t 1 θ t 2 h 1 where h 1 is calculated depth of soil water storage 80 cm θ t 1 and θ t 2 are the actual soil volumetric water content

fig 1 and more information is given in our previous publication li et al 2020 the sensors data were collected every 5 s and 15 min average values were stored in the data logger the vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated from the measured air temperature and relative humidity allen et al 1998 2 5 determination of relevant parameters of tomato plants to prevent marginal effects two lines of tomato plants were set up as protective rows at the east and west boundaries of each plot representative tomato plants in the middle of each plot were marked and sampled randomly to determine the relevant parameters 2 5 1 yield and water productivity the red ripen fruits from the first to the fifth truss were harvested in sequence from 10 tomato plants according to the order of fruit ripening the fruits collected from the same truss had similar ripeness among different treatments the fruit number n and the fresh weight g of every single fruit was measured using an electronic balance mettler toledo inc greifensee switzerland to obtain the corresponding average yield per plant y g for each treatment the total yield ytotal t hm2 was calculated from the average yield per plant and planting density under each irrigation method the water productivity wp kg m3 was calculated as follow 4 wp y total et c 2 5 2 mass concentration the red ripen fruits with similar visual performance and ripeness were harvested from the second to the fourth truss in sequence for all treatments about 30 fruits were randomly selected at each sampling the fruits were washed with distilled water and disinfected afterwards were grouped to prepare the fresh sample and lyophilized powder for determining mass concentration cmass the cmass of ascorbic acid asa μg g fw was determined by 2 6 dichlorophenol indophenol titration method using the homogenate prepared by mixing oxalic acid solution and fresh samples the cmass of lycopene and β carotene mg g dw were measured based on the lyophilized powder extract containing carotenoids and the cmass of total phenols mg gae g dw was determined by the folin ciocalteu method using the lyophilized powder extract containing phenolic compounds aoac 2007 beserra et al 2011 benzie et al 1996 dannehl et al 2014 ilahy et al 2011 motilva et al 2014 kaur et al 2013 singleton et al 1999 re et al 1999 the total antioxidant activity taa μmol te g dw of tomato fruits consist of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity teac assay free radical 1 1 dipheny l 2 pircrylhydrazyl dpph scavenging activity assay and ferric reducing antioxidant power frap assay were employed in this study to measure taa using the lyophilized powder extract that contains hydrophilic or lipophilic antioxidants respectively for the further analysis and expressing on the basis of fresh weight fw the units of cmass for lycopene β carotene total phenols and taa were converted to μg g fw μg g fw μg gae g fw and μmol te g fw respectively 2 5 3 nutrient yield and nutrient water productivity ny represents the yield of phytochemicals or taa that can be harvested per unit area of crops bumgarner et al 2012 nyathi et al 2019b which was calculated using eq 5 nwp represents the amount of phytochemicals or taa that plants can produce by consuming per unit volume of water renault and wallender 2000 which was calculated according to eq 6 5 ny 1 1000 c mass y total 6 nwp 1 1000 c mass wp for lycopene β carotene and asa the unit of ny and nwp were kg hm2 and g m3 respectively kg gae hm2 and g gae m3 for total phenols respectively kmol te hm2 and mol te m3 for taa respectively 2 5 4 contribution to human nutrition the relevance of the results on nutrient contents for human nutrition was evaluated in view of the standard from the world health organization who that recommends at least 400 g of vegetables and fruits daily intake for each person blas et al 2019 for this paper we assumed that half of them are fresh tomato fruits since 2 or 3 servings of tomato products per day was deemed to a tomato rich diet in nutritional research parsons et al 2008 yang et al 2020a the loss of nutritional values during processing or cooking is not considered due to the raw tomato fruits were evaluated we further assumed that around 50 of functional components can be absorbed by human body regarding the bioavailability constraints therefore the percentage contribution of eating 200 g of fresh tomato fruits to the human nutritional requirements was calculated according to the recommended daily nutrient intake rdni table 2 of nutrients as follows 7 percentage contribution 0 5 200 c mass 1000 rdni 100 2 5 5 farmland and water resources utilization for the sake of this study we assumed that the human nutritional requirements were supplied solely by tomato fruits harvested in this experiment and 50 of the functional components can be absorbed by human body which similar to other studies nyathi et al 2019a 2019b the farmland and water resources utilization in greenhouse tomato production to satisfy the annual nutritional requirements per capita were calculated as follow for both irrigation methods 8 farmland utilization m 2 capita year 365 rdni 0 5 100 ny 9 water resource utilization m 3 capita year 365 rdni 0 5 1000 nwp 2 6 data processing and analysis statistical analysis was carried out by spss statistics 20 0 ibm ny usa and graphs were drawn by originpro 9 1 originlab corporation ma usa one way anova duncan s new multiple range test was used to determine the differences in parameters measured under different irrigation methods welch test was used in the case of the data that did not meet the requirement of homogeneity of variance jan and shieh 2014 for the data that did not follow the normal distribution the mann whitney u test and kruskal wallis test was used in the summer and winter experiment respectively the significance test level for each statistical analysis method was set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 variations in environmental factors in the greenhouse the dynamic changes of soil moisture content in the planned wetted soil layer were notably different between drip and furrow irrigation fig 2 from the beginning of water management to the end of the tomato growth period the average soil moisture content under drip irrigation di1 di2 was 0 2154 and 0 2254 cm3 cm3 during summer and winter cycle respectively which was 9 0 and 2 4 lower than those 0 2368 and 0 2308 cm3 cm3 respectively under furrow irrigation fi1 fi2 correspondingly the total irrigation amount under drip irrigation was 228 6 and 124 9 mm which was 17 0 and 29 9 lower than furrow irrigation in summer 274 5 mm and winter cycle 178 5 mm respectively average water applied per irrigation event was 36 8 in summer or 47 6 in winter lower in drip irrigation than furrow irrigation the total irrigation amount in control group 177 0 mm was similar with furrow irrigation fi2 but the average soil moisture content 0 2376 cm3 cm3 was 2 7 higher other environmental factors showed significant seasonal changes under different irrigation methods fig 3 daily average air temperature 25 2 c vpd 1 9kpa and soil temperature 25 1 c under drip irrigation di1 in summer were significantly higher by 5 7 12 3 and 18 4 respectively compared with furrow irrigation fi1 23 8 c 1 7kpa and 21 6 c similarly these parameters were higher by 1 5 p 0 004 12 0 p 0 001 and 8 4 p 0 001 under drip irrigation di2 18 8 c 0 9kpa and 19 1 c in winter respectively compared with furrow irrigation fi2 18 6 c 0 8kpa and 17 6 c however the daily average rh under drip irrigation was lower by 0 3 p 0 554 and 4 5 p 0 001 during summer and winter cycle respectively the environmental factors under control group were lower than those in other treatments di2 and fi2 except the daily average rh and soil temperature was significantly higher in addition pyr and par were not affected by irrigation methods while they were obviously significantly higher in summer than winter data not shown 3 2 yield etc and water productivity of tomato during summer cycle the average fruit number per plant under drip irrigation di1 was 5 1 higher than that under furrow irrigation fi1 significant decrease 15 5 in average single fruit fresh weight reduced the average yield per plant and total yield by about 12 3 in contrast no difference was found in average fruit number single fruit fresh weight yield per plant and total yield between drip di2 and furrow irrigation fi2 during winter cycle table 3 for control group average single fruit fresh weight 10 4 yield per plant and total yield 9 3 were significantly lower than furrow irrigation fi2 while the average fruit number per plant was slightly higher the etc under drip irrigation di1 di2 decreased by 10 4 and 11 7 compared to furrow irrigation fi1 fi2 in summer and winter cycles respectively however the wp under drip irrigation was insignificantly lower by 2 1 p 0 106 in summer and significantly higher by 13 1 p 0 014 in winter compared to furrow irrigation in addition the etc under ck was 14 3 higher than that in drip irrigation di2 but no difference was found compared to furrow irrigation fi2 the wp under control group decreased by 20 5 p 0 001 and 10 1 p 0 052 compared to drip di2 and furrow irrigation fi2 respectively 3 3 mass concentration nutrient yield and nutrient water productivity the cmass and nwp of asa were not affected by irrigation method during summer cycle table 4 however compared with furrow irrigation fi1 the cmass of lycopene β carotene and total phenols increased by 10 8 14 5 and 21 4 under drip irrigation di1 respectively and the nwp increased by 8 5 12 1 and 18 9 respectively in terms of ny total phenols under drip irrigation di1 was 6 5 higher but lycopene was 2 8 lower than that under furrow irrigation fi1 respectively while other phytochemicals remained unchanged in the winter experiment the cmass of lycopene β carotene total phenols and asa increased by 12 7 12 2 15 5 and 19 9 under drip irrigation di2 respectively the ny increased by 12 6 12 1 15 4 and 19 8 respectively and the nwp increased by 27 5 26 9 30 7 and 35 7 respectively compared with furrow irrigation fi2 for control group the cmass ny and nwp of phytochemicals improved significantly compared with furrow irrigation fi2 except for asa however the nwp of phytochemicals was lower than those in drip irrigation di2 even though the cmass was higher in the summer experiment the cmass ny and nwp of taa in drip irrigation di1 were 14 5 24 5 0 5 9 3 and 12 1 22 0 higher than those in furrow irrigation fi1 table 4 respectively which determined by different assays in the winter experiment the dpph assay showed the cmass ny and nwp of taa under drip irrigation di2 increased significantly by 50 6 50 5 and 70 3 respectively compared with furrow irrigation fi2 the results of frap assay 9 9 9 8 and 24 3 under drip irrigation were similar to those in dpph assay while the teac assay showed completely opposite response 11 8 11 3 and 0 4 under drip irrigation in addition the cmass ny and nwp of taa under control group were significantly higher than those under drip di2 and furrow irrigation fi2 frap assay or lay somewhere in between dpph assay or similar with each other teac assay 3 4 contribution to human nutrition for the summer experiment every 200 g fresh tomato fruit under drip irrigation di1 could meet 97 9 16 3 0 9 21 5 and 2 4 4 5 of the daily nutritional requirements for lycopene β carotene total phenols asa and taa respectively which were higher than those 88 4 14 3 0 7 20 8 and 2 1 3 8 respectively under furrow irrigation fi1 even though no significant difference was found in asa fig 4 for winter experiment per 200 g fresh tomato fruits from drip irrigation di2 could meet 90 2 15 4 0 8 25 1 and 1 5 4 1 of daily requirements for the nutrients aforementioned respectively which were higher than those 80 0 13 7 0 6 20 9 and 1 3 3 0 respectively in furrow irrigation fi2 while no significant difference was found in β carotene and taa determined by teac and frap assays in addition the percentage contribution to human nutrition for lycopene β carotene total phenols and taa frap assay in control group were significantly higher than those in drip di2 and furrow irrigation fi2 3 5 farmland and water resource utilization in tomato production compared with furrow irrigation the farmland employed for the greenhouse tomato production to satisfy the human annual nutritional requirements was generally less under drip irrigation except for lycopene and asa in summer cycle and teac in winter cycle table 5 furthermore the amount of water that consumed to produce adequate nutrition was significantly lower under drip irrigation in our experiment except asa in summer cycle and teac in winter cycle in terms of control group ck less farmland and water resources were consumed for greenhouse tomato production compared with furrow irrigation fi2 apart from the teac however in general less farmland and more water amount were needed in control group compared with drip irrigation di2 4 discussions drip irrigation method employs localized application of water in the plant root zone without irrigating the non cropped area karlberg et al 2007 therefore a smaller designed soil wetting proportion p 0 5 was used in drip irrigation which account for the lower total irrigation amount soil moisture content and etc compared with furrow irrigation table 1 the lower etc under drip irrigation was a direct result of the less water uptake transportation by plants and implied the plants suffered from a certain degree of water stress the irrigation schedule of ck was the same as that of furrow irrigation fi2 which explains the equal results of total irrigation amount and etc of both treatments however the average soil moisture content in control group was slightly higher this could be the result of a more uniform distribution of soil water kumar and dey 2011 less water uptake and seepage loss above the planned depth of wetted soil layer 50 cm compared with treatment fi2 li et al 2020 and might relate to the enhanced soil water storage capacity tiwari et al 1998 the microclimate within crop canopy or near soil surface is strongly affected by irrigation methods kueppers and snyder 2012 xu et al 2017 especially in closed or semi closed agricultural systems such as solar greenhouses more energy that intercepted by underlying surface was partitioned into sensible heat under drip irrigation which was determined by the interactions between plants and environment and should account for the variations in environment between drip and furrow irrigation methods fig 3 as explained in our previous publication li et al 2020 for the winter cycle the solar energy received by greenhouse was less and the exchange of energy inside and outside the greenhouse was also reduced due to insulation during night for the purpose of heat preservation resulting in smaller differences in environment among treatments the control group had more similar environment as furrow irrigation fi2 rather than drip irrigation di2 because the energy partitioning on the underlying surface was strongly related to crop water consumption zhou et al 2012 li et al 2020 the specific environment generated under different irrigation methods figs 2 and 3 could have affected the division expansion and differentiation of tissue cells plant growth and development metabolism and other physiological and biochemical processes bertin and genard 2018 bisbis et al 2018 toscano et al 2019 which ultimately could have determined the yield productivity and quality of tomato fruits 4 1 yield components of tomato the total yield of tomato fruits in our study table 3 was comparable to the reports in field 89 6 175 0 t hm2 sun et al 2018 zheng et al 2013 and solar greenhouse experiments 102 2 187 2 t hm2 chen et al 2013 wang et al 2015 which conducted in the same experimental station fruit number and single fruit fresh weight are two important factors for yield components results showed that the difference in total yield between drip and furrow irrigation was mainly attributed to the variation in single fruit fresh weight similar to the report of chen et al 2013 ritchie 2015 also argued that plant differentiation quantitative increase in size was more sensitive than development fruit setting to abiotic stresses other than temperature and light the fruit fresh weight is the result of the balance between the inflow and loss of water and photoassimilate reflecting the change of net water accumulation in fruit bertin and genard 2018 the environment generated under drip irrigation high air and soil temperature high vpd and low soil moisture content figs 2 and 3 probably reduced both the plant water uptake and phloem sap flow decreased the water potential gradient between fruit and stem and accelerate fruit maturation then declined the net water accumulation in tomato fruits compared with furrow irrigation gruda 2005 guichard et al 2005 lobell et al 2015 okello et al 2015 these explain the lower results of average single fruit fresh weight yield per plant and total yield under drip irrigation especially in summer cycle table 3 on the contrary the small demand of evapotranspiration and the similar environment among treatments in winter cycle making the effect of irrigation method on water accumulation in tomato fruits was minor so did the influence on both yield parameters regarding control group the exorbitant moisture content poor aeration and high temperature in rhizospheric soil environment resulting in the decrease of single fruit fresh weight li et al 2015 which also related to the lower plant water uptake zhang et al 2019 however due to the higher fruit number the average yield per plant and total yield in control group were similar to other treatments di2 and fi2 it is generally believed that water deficit reduces the number of fruits coyagocruz et al 2019 favati et al 2009 however some studies pointed out the variations in irrigation amount or methods under partial root zone drying zegbe et al 2004 or field conditions guida et al 2017 did not affect the tomato fruit number which supports our results abortion of flower and fruit is related to the limit of sink strength and reducing the inhibition of sink strength on photosynthesis is beneficial to tomato fruit setting ruan et al 2012 high temperature reduces fertility and number of pollen grains released in tomato plants sato et al 2000 hence increases the parthenocarpy which have weaker sink strength than normal tomato fruits sato et al 2001 therefore the minor competition for photoassimilate between unfertilized flowers and other sink organs under drip irrigation explains the similar results of fruit number compared with furrow irrigation which attribute to the smaller normal fruits table 3 and more parthenocarpy in the former malash et al 2008 also found that number of tomato fruits under drip irrigation was more but the fresh weight was lower compared with furrow irrigation 4 2 water productivity of tomato the wp of tomato in our study table 3 was comparable to that in field 28 6 55 8 kg m3 studies sun et al 2018 wei et al 2016 and solar greenhouse experiment 37 4 71 2 kg m3 qiu et al 2013 wang et al 2015 conducted in the same experimental station appropriate deficit irrigation strategies can improve the wp of tomato with marginal yield decrease kuscu et al 2014 yang et al 2019 however some reports indicated that deficit irrigation has no effect on wp of tomato zheng et al 2013 yang et al 2020b which support our results of summer experiment tomato plants are more sensitive to water shortage during blooming and fruit setting periods kuscu et al 2014 some studies showed that the deficit irrigation imposed in vegetative growth phase could increase tomato wp chen et al 2013 khapte et al 2019 while no effect on wp was found during other phenological phases of tomato lu et al 2019 which implied the water deficit during the vegetative growth phase is vital for improving tomato wp however for the purpose of the establishment of tomato seedlings fully irrigation was applied at dat 1 and 10 respectively for both treatments in our experiment fig 2 the soil water content was relative high during the vegetative growth phase until may 5 2017 in summer cycle until nov 30 2017 in winter cycle suggesting no tomato plants were suffered from the water stress therefore the water applied during this period was not beneficial for the improvement in tomato wp under drip irrigation in summer cycle moreover the tomato yield increased even without irrigation in the following weeks after transplanting when soil moisture was sufficient at the beginning ngouajio et al 2007 which also supported our view to some extent in contrast the wp of tomato under drip irrigation significantly improved in winter cycle as expected other important environmental factor for wp is vpd which is the key to determine whether deficit irrigation can impose a positive effect on tomato plants li et al 2019 the higher vpd limited the positive effect of drip irrigation on wp in summer compared with furrow irrigation while the opposite result was found in winter fig 3 and table 3 jiao et al 2019 also reported that the wp of tomato significantly increased under low vpd condition furthermore the effect of water insufficient on wp varied from negative to positive along with the prolongation of water stress which attributed to the acclimatization of plants caused by a series of changes in anatomy morphology and biochemistry gilbert and medina 2016 yu et al 2020 therefore the relatively longer growth period in winter seemed conducive to the further improvement in wp of tomato under drip irrigation 4 3 nutrient yield and nutrient water productivity of tomato improvements in ny under drip irrigation were not distinct in summer table 4 however the cmass of nutrients was higher compared to furrow irrigation in control group the increase in cmass of nutrients was not fully reflected in ny on the contrary the cmass and ny of nutrients under drip irrigation were both preferable to furrow irrigation in winter because total yield was similar between these treatments our results indicated that the ny of nutrients in tomato fruits was largely affected by yield which was on accord with the findings on lentils graham et al 2018 forage ren et al 2016 leafy vegetables nyathi et al 2018 and wheat moreira ascarrunz et al 2016 as a result for the ny compared with furrow irrigation the notable improvement in tomato fruit quality and health promoting value of tomato under drip irrigation was neutralized by the negative effect on total yield nevertheless our results show that by targeted steering of the irrigation the balance between yield and nutritional quality can be influenced eventually there is potential to reach high levels of ny in order to obtain adequate nutrition for people graham et al 2018 the concept of wp eq 4 is less suitable for horticultural crops because the value of their products is highly dependent on the crop quality zheng et al 2013 however nwp overcomes this shortcoming and links the water consumption productivity and quality of crops thereby shifting the focus of agricultural production from more food per drop to more nutrition per drop siwi and iwmi 2004 similar to the results of nyathi et al 2018 2019b we found that the nwp of most nutrients in tomato fruits significantly improved under drip irrigation table 4 both in summer and winter which implied that the higher efficiency of converting available water resources into product compared with furrow irrigation it should be pointed out that the improvement in nwp under drip irrigation mainly attributed to the increase in cmass of nutrients in summer which closely related to the environment in the greenhouse however for grain legumes that cultured in different locations the variations in nwp were mainly determined by yield chibarabada et al 2017 and the different physiological responses of grain legumes to environment and water might account for the confliction with our study therefore we propose that the concept of nwp should be an important criterion for the comparison of a broad range of crops with different productive potential for nutrients and biomass ny and nwp link up water and agricultural production strategies providing the possibility to settle the global food and nutrition security issues simultaneously under finite resource conditions chibarabada et al 2017 unfortunately the information on crop ny and nwp are still very limited and to the best of our knowledge there are no experimental studies on tomato on this respect therefore our results can provide a benchmark for further research but it is also difficult to currently compare with other reliable data 4 4 water agriculture nutrition human health nexus agricultural water use crop production nutritional requirements and human health are interlinked and are usually evaluated independently using different indicators mabhaudhi et al 2016 ny can provide useful information of water agriculture nutrition human health nexus and the united nations food and agriculture organization fao has developed an nwp methodology to enhance the understanding of the relationship between water and nutrition blas et al 2019 the results of percentage contribution to human nutrition showed that the drip irrigated tomato fruits can generally provide more nutrition compared with furrow irrigation by mass fig 4 the tomato variety cultured in this experiment has excellent potential in supplying the daily requirements of lycopene β carotene and asa for human however the demands for phenolic compounds and taa need to be supplemented from other food sources it should be pointed out that consuming any kind of food to satisfy the requirement of single nutrient may lead to huge even dangerous nutritional imbalance graham et al 2018 therefore the human should not obtain lycopene only from tomato notwithstanding the 200 g fresh fruits in our experiment can reach more than 0 8 times of the rdni for lycopene fig 4 in addition the nutrient dense tomato fruits under drip irrigation were also more beneficial to reduce the intake of carbohydrates moreira ascarrunz et al 2016 the utilization efficiency of farmland and water resources under drip irrigation was higher than furrow irrigation from the perspective of meeting human nutritional requirements by greenhouse tomato fruits table 5 the transformation i e from furrow to drip irrigation satisfying the pursuit of nutritious diets and healthy living for people and reducing the pressure on the environment brought by agricultural production charles et al 2010 foley et al 2011 which particularly important for the arid areas in northwest china however relying on tomato fruits alone is not an environment friendly choice for supplement the phenolic compounds and taa in diet regardless of irrigation methods we suggest that each aspect of the water agriculture nutrition human health nexus should be equally attended because the overemphasis of one item probably lead to neglect the interactions among the rest components in this linkage mabhaudhi et al 2016 5 conclusions in the summer experiment the single fruit fresh weight and yield of tomato under drip irrigation were significantly lower than those in furrow irrigation which accounted for no changes in wp the non beneficial irrigation during the tomato vegetative growth phase and the high vpd condition further limited the improvement in wp under drip irrigation however the tomato fruit quality was superior under drip irrigation thereby can provide more adequate nutrition for human beings nevertheless the commonly higher cmass of nutrients did not fully correspond to the increase in ny under drip irrigation while the nwp generally improved compared with furrow irrigation this implied that the ny was mainly determined by the yield while the nwp was mainly affected by the cmass in the winter experiment no significant difference was found in single fruit fresh weight and yield of tomato between drip and furrow irrigation which related to the similar environmental conditions while the wp ny and nwp were notably improved under drip irrigation in general drip irrigation improved tomato fruit quality in the greenhouse and that can offset the yield reduction and improve the potential and water use efficiency in nutrients production furthermore the consumption of farmland and water resources for greenhouse tomato production was generally lower under drip irrigation in summary drip irrigation can achieve a good balance between the yield and quality of tomato meanwhile reducing the pressure on environment hence should be further applied in the greenhouse in arid

10136,to address the twin issues of food and nutrition security the focus of agricultural production should be shifted from biomass productivity to nutritional gains the objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of conversion from furrow to drip irrigation on the yield components water productivity wp nutritional yield ny and nutritional water productivity nwp of tomato during two consecutive growth cycles 2017 2018 in a greenhouse in the arid area of northwest china results showed that the environment under drip irrigation was more beneficial to the accumulation of phytochemicals and the formation of total antioxidant activity in tomato fruits which also significantly increased the nwp however the notable decline in single fruit fresh weight reducing the tomato yield significantly under drip irrigation in summer while the wp and ny were similar to furrow irrigation this indicated that the ny of tomato was mainly determined by the fruit yield while the nwp was strongly affected by the mass concentration of nutrients in contrast no difference was found in the single fruit fresh weight and tomato yield between drip and furrow irrigation in winter which related to the similar environmental conditions while the wp and ny were significantly higher under drip irrigation in summary the potential and water use efficiency in nutrient production of tomato were enhanced under drip irrigation and the improvement of fruit quality can offset the negative effect of yield reduction therefore drip irrigation can achieve a good balance between the high yield and superior quality of tomato fruits meanwhile reducing the pressure on the environment caused by horticultural production we propose that the drip irrigation should be employed in the greenhouse in arid areas for tomato production and the concepts of ny and nwp can be further applied to other horticultural crops with high nutritional value keywords irrigation method environmental stress fruit quality nutritional yield nutritional water productivity 1 introduction food security exists when all people at all times have physical social and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life fao 1996 in the past decades the green revolution 2 0 greatly improved agricultural productivity and food availability hence maintained global food security godecke et al 2018 pingali 2012 however more than half of the world population is currently still affected by undernutrition vinoth and ravindhran 2017 which may adversely influence physical and mental condition of children decrease human immunity and increase risk of chronical diseases govender et al 2016 the nutrition insecurity bringing a huge burden to global public health socio economic and human well being which is more serious than food insecurity martin et al 2011 crops are the main source of essential nutrients for the growth and development of human beings and improving crop quality is a sustainable and vital approach to address global nutrition insecurity vinoth and ravindhran 2017 however the high accumulation of phytochemicals as well as crop biomass cannot be achieved simultaneously under any environmental scenarios bumgarner et al 2012 thereby yield increases usually accompany degradation of quality graham et al 2018 therefore there is a trade off between the crop yield and quality however studies on agricultural water use crop productivity nutrition and human health conducted by agronomists or nutritionists were usually isolated nyathi et al 2018 in order to cut the gordian knot of food and nutrition security water agriculture nutrition human health nexus should be emphasized and further studied bumgarner et al 2012 and renault and wallender 2000 were first to propose concepts of nutrient yield ny and nutrient water productivity nwp respectively ny combines crop yield and nutrients mass concentration to calculate the amount of functional components produced per unit area which can effectively compare the actual nutritional value of crops under different production systems graham et al 2018 nwp refers to the amount of nutrients produced per unit amount of water blas et al 2019 and reflects the efficiency of crops in converting available water resources into nutrient yield zhang et al 2018 by using ny and nwp the focus of agricultural production can be altered from increasing yield to improving quality which is beneficial to ensure both global food and nutrition security however only a few studies are focused on ny or nwp for example for grain legumes chibarabada et al 2017 wheat moreira ascarrunz et al 2016 sweet potato nyathi et al 2019a twenty vegetables widely utilized in sub saharan africa nyathi et al 2019b and a comparative study about mediterranean diet in spain blas et al 2019 tomato is one of the important horticultural crops which can provide nutritious and healthy food its high number of functional components including carotenoids vitamins phenols cellulose as well as mineral elements ripoll et al 2016 and not at least its attractive flavor make tomato one of the most popular vegetable crops with the world wide largest vegetable cropping area nangare et al 2016 due to its wide application in the human diet minor changes in the concentration yield or productivity of nutrients may have a substantial impact on the nutritional value of people however to the best of our knowledge no experimental research have been reported that related ny and nwp under different agronomic or irrigation managements of greenhouse tomato the solar greenhouse industry is well developed in northwest china which is an arid zone and therefore facing serious problems of water shortage wang et al 2011 although drip irrigation is strongly promoted by the government to save water furrow irrigation is currently still the common practice among local greenhouse growers one of the reasons was that yield reduction was reported under drip irrigation in the greenhouse however organoleptic quality nutritional quality and antioxidant activity of tomato fruits generally improved compared with furrow irrigation according to the reportes of our research group previously therefore the yield and water productivity of tomato in the greenhouse as well as the ny and nwp of phytochemicals and total antioxidant activity are evaluated under drip and furrow irrigation in this research to answer scientific questions including 1 can improvement of tomato fruit quality offset the negative effect of yield reduction under drip irrigation 2 how does conversion of irrigation method impact human nutrition farmland and water resource utilization in horticultural production 2 materials and methods 2 1 general situation of the experimental site the experiment was carried out in a non heated solar greenhouse located in the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university from april 20 to august 19 2017 summer cycle and from november 1 2017 to april 9 2018 winter cycle the experimental station is located near wuwei city gansu province china e 102 50 50 n 37 52 20 a s l 1580 m which has a typical continental temperate climate the solar greenhouse employed in our study is on an east west orientation 70 m long and 8 5 m wide with the effective planting area of 360 m2 more technical information about this greenhouse can be found in li et al 2020 the soil used in the greenhouse experiment is classified as irrigated desert soil siltigic orthic anthrosols composed of 12 2 clay 60 3 silt and 27 5 sand for summer and winter cycle the average soil dry bulk density of the planned wetted soil layer 0 50 cm was 1 56 0 03 and 1 58 0 04 g cm3 respectively and the field soil water capacity θ fc was 0 27 0 01 and 0 26 0 00 cm3 cm3 respectively the soil surface was covered with clear 0 05 mm polyethylene film to reduce soil evaporation and weed growth 2 2 crop management the tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill grown in the greenhouse was a popular local variety jinpeng 11 indeterminate type tomato seedlings were transplanted to plots when they had four leaves april 20 2017 in summer cycle and november 1 2017 in winter cycle with the row spacing of 0 7 m wide and 0 5 m narrow alternately and the interplant spacing was 0 5 m the planting density of tomato was 3 78 plants m2 for both drip and furrow irrigations the drip tape with emitter flow rate of 1 38 l h at 0 1 mpa was placed along the main stem of tomato plants for each row in the drip irrigation system and two rows of tomatoes were planted on every ridge in the furrow irrigation system as presented in fig 1 all plots were fully irrigated directly and 10 days after transplanting dat fig 2 to help the establishment of seedlings cropping period was limited to five trusses per plant and crop management fertilization pollination de leafing weeding and pest control was kept the same in both treatments 2 3 experimental design the summer experiment had two treatments i e drip irrigation di1 under mulch and furrow irrigation fi1 under mulch while in winter cycle three treatments were included drip irrigation di2 under mulch furrow irrigation fi2 under mulch and a control group ck the summer experiment was used as an example to illustrate the experimental layout fig 1 while the pattern in winter cycle was similar to it and can be found in li et al 2020 in the same experimental period the area of each treatment was equal and the adjacent plots were separated by impermeable thermal insulation materials both above and below the ground to ensure the environment was completely isolated among each compartment the water management for drip di1 di2 and furrow irrigation fi1 fi2 treatments in both cropping cycles was conducted as follows table 1 from 10 days after transplanting to the end of the growth period tomato plants were irrigated to the upper limit of irrigation that is 90 2 of θ fc once the average soil moisture content within the planned wetted soil layer 50 cm dropped to 75 2 of θ fc the value of designed soil wetting proportion p in drip irrigation equal to 0 5 was lower than that in furrow irrigation equal to 1 0 which attribute to the higher irrigation efficiency yang et al 2017 treatment ck was under drip system but the irrigation amount and schedule were the same as furrow irrigation fi2 in winter cycle the theoretical irrigation amount i mm in each irrigation event for drip and furrow irrigation plots was calculated as follows 1 i 10 p θ 1 θ 2 h 0 where h 0 is the planned depth of wetted soil layer 50 cm θ 1 is the upper limit of irrigation cm 3 c m 3 i e 90 2 of θ fc and θ 2 is the actual soil volumetric water content within the planned wetted soil layer before irrigation cm 3 c m 3 actual irrigation amount ia mm was measured by a multiple jet vane wheel water meter that installed at the header of each irrigation system the actual water consumption etc mm of tomato plants was calculated using the water balance equation as follows 2 et c i a s where s is the change in soil water storage over a period time mm can be calculated as follows 3 s 10 θ t 1 θ t 2 h 1 where h 1 is calculated depth of soil water storage 80 cm θ t 1 and θ t 2 are the actual soil volumetric water content cm 3 c m 3 within the main root zone at the time t 1 and t 2 respectively 2 4 determination of the environmental factors inside the greenhouse the environmental factors monitored in this study were

were measured using the ech2o soil moisture monitoring system meter group inc wa usa and the probes was calibrated by gravimetric method using soil samples before and during the experimental period every week the microclimate parameters were measured using the em50 microclimate monitoring system meter group inc wa usa the arrangement of instruments and sensors aforementioned were diagrammatic in fig 1 and more information is given in our previous publication li et al 2020 the sensors data were collected every 5 s and 15 min average values were stored in the data logger the vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated from the measured air temperature and relative humidity allen et al 1998 2 5 determination of relevant parameters of tomato plants to prevent marginal effects two lines of tomato plants were set up as protective rows at the east and west boundaries of each plot representative tomato plants in the middle of each plot were marked and sampled randomly to determine the relevant parameters 2 5 1 yield and water productivity the red ripen fruits from the first to the fifth truss were harvested in sequence from 10 tomato plants according to the order of fruit ripening the fruits collected from the same truss had similar ripeness among different treatments the fruit number n and the fresh weight g of every single fruit was measured using an electronic balance mettler toledo inc greifensee switzerland to obtain the corresponding average yield per plant y g for each treatment the total yield ytotal t hm2 was calculated from the average yield per plant and planting density under each irrigation method the water productivity wp kg m3 was calculated as follow 4 wp y total et c 2 5 2 mass concentration the red ripen fruits with similar visual performance and ripeness were harvested from the second to the fourth truss in sequence for all treatments about 30 fruits were randomly selected at each sampling the fruits were washed with distilled water and disinfected afterwards were grouped to prepare the fresh sample and lyophilized powder for determining mass concentration cmass the cmass of ascorbic acid asa μg g fw was determined by 2 6 dichlorophenol indophenol titration method using the homogenate prepared by mixing oxalic acid solution and fresh samples the cmass of lycopene and β carotene mg g dw were measured based on the lyophilized powder extract containing carotenoids and the cmass of total phenols mg gae g dw was determined by the folin ciocalteu method using the lyophilized powder extract containing phenolic compounds aoac 2007 beserra et al 2011 benzie et al 1996 dannehl et al 2014 ilahy et al 2011 motilva et al 2014 kaur et al 2013 singleton et al 1999 re et al 1999 the total antioxidant activity taa μmol te g dw of tomato fruits consist of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity teac assay free radical 1 1 dipheny l 2 pircrylhydrazyl dpph scavenging activity assay and ferric reducing antioxidant power frap assay were employed in this study to measure taa using the lyophilized powder extract that contains hydrophilic or lipophilic antioxidants respectively for the further analysis and expressing on the basis of fresh weight fw the units of cmass for lycopene β carotene total phenols and taa were converted to μg g fw μg g fw μg gae g fw and μmol te g fw respectively 2 5 3 nutrient yield and nutrient water productivity ny represents the yield of phytochemicals or taa that can be harvested per unit area of crops bumgarner et al 2012 nyathi et al 2019b which was calculated using eq 5 nwp represents the amount of phytochemicals or taa that plants can produce by consuming per unit volume of water renault and wallender 2000 which was calculated according to eq 6 5 ny 1 1000 c mass y total 6 nwp 1 1000 c mass wp for lycopene β carotene and asa the unit of ny and nwp were kg hm2 and g m3 respectively kg gae hm2 and g gae m3 for total phenols respectively kmol te hm2 and mol te m3 for taa respectively 2 5 4 contribution to human nutrition the relevance of the results on nutrient contents for human nutrition was evaluated in view of the standard from the world health organization who that recommends at least 400 g of vegetables and fruits daily intake for each person blas et al 2019 for this paper we assumed that half of them are fresh tomato fruits since 2 or 3 servings of tomato products per day was deemed to a tomato rich diet in nutritional research parsons et al 2008 yang et al 2020a the loss of nutritional values during processing or cooking is not considered due to the raw tomato fruits were evaluated we further assumed that around 50 of functional components can be absorbed by human body regarding the bioavailability constraints therefore the percentage contribution of eating 200 g of fresh tomato fruits to the human nutritional requirements was calculated according to the recommended daily nutrient intake rdni table 2 of nutrients as follows 7 percentage contribution 0 5 200 c mass 1000 rdni 100 2 5 5 farmland and water resources utilization for the sake of this study we assumed that the human nutritional requirements were supplied solely by tomato fruits harvested in this experiment and 50 of the functional components can be absorbed by human body which similar to other studies nyathi et al 2019a 2019b the farmland and water resources utilization in greenhouse tomato production to satisfy the annual nutritional requirements per capita were calculated as follow for both irrigation methods 8 farmland utilization m 2 capita year 365 rdni 0 5 100 ny 9 water resource utilization m 3 capita year 365 rdni 0 5 1000 nwp 2 6 data processing and analysis statistical analysis was carried out by spss statistics 20 0 ibm ny usa and graphs were drawn by originpro 9 1 originlab corporation ma usa one way anova duncan s new multiple range test was used to determine the differences in parameters measured under different irrigation methods welch test was used in the case of the data that did not meet the requirement of homogeneity of variance jan and shieh 2014 for the data that did not follow the normal distribution the mann whitney u test and kruskal wallis test was used in the summer and winter experiment respectively the significance test level for each statistical analysis method was set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 variations in environmental factors in the greenhouse the dynamic changes of soil moisture content in the planned wetted soil layer were notably different between drip and furrow irrigation fig 2 from the beginning of water management to the end of the tomato growth period the average soil moisture content under drip irrigation di1 di2 was 0 2154 and 0 2254 cm3 cm3 during summer and winter cycle respectively which was 9 0 and 2 4 lower than those 0 2368 and 0 2308 cm3 cm3 respectively under furrow irrigation fi1 fi2 correspondingly the total irrigation amount under drip irrigation was 228 6 and 124 9 mm which was 17 0 and 29 9 lower than furrow irrigation in summer 274 5 mm and winter cycle 178 5 mm respectively average water applied per irrigation event was 36 8 in summer or 47 6 in winter lower in drip irrigation than furrow irrigation the total irrigation amount in control group 177 0 mm was similar with furrow irrigation fi2 but the average soil moisture content 0 2376 cm3 cm3 was 2 7 higher other environmental factors showed significant seasonal changes under different irrigation methods fig 3 daily average air temperature 25 2 c vpd 1 9kpa and soil temperature 25 1 c under drip irrigation di1 in summer were significantly higher by 5 7 12 3 and 18 4 respectively compared with furrow irrigation fi1 23 8 c 1 7kpa and 21 6 c similarly these parameters were higher by 1 5 p 0 004 12 0 p 0 001 and 8 4 p 0 001 under drip irrigation di2 18 8 c 0 9kpa and 19 1 c in winter respectively compared with furrow irrigation fi2 18 6 c 0 8kpa and 17 6 c however the daily average rh under drip irrigation was lower by 0 3 p 0 554 and 4 5 p 0 001 during summer and winter cycle respectively the environmental factors under control group were lower than those in other treatments di2 and fi2 except the daily average rh and soil temperature was significantly higher in addition pyr and par were not affected by irrigation methods while they were obviously significantly higher in summer than winter data not shown 3 2 yield etc and water productivity of tomato during summer cycle the average fruit number per plant under drip irrigation di1 was 5 1 higher than that under furrow irrigation fi1 significant decrease 15 5 in average single fruit fresh weight reduced the average yield per plant and total yield by about 12 3 in contrast no difference was found in average fruit number single fruit fresh weight yield per plant and total yield between drip di2 and furrow irrigation fi2 during winter cycle table 3 for control group average single fruit fresh weight 10 4 yield per plant and total yield 9 3 were significantly lower than furrow irrigation fi2 while the average fruit number per plant was slightly higher the etc under drip irrigation di1 di2 decreased by 10 4 and 11 7 compared to furrow irrigation fi1 fi2 in summer and winter cycles respectively however the wp under drip irrigation was insignificantly lower by 2 1 p 0 106 in summer and significantly higher by 13 1 p 0 014 in winter compared to furrow irrigation in addition the etc under ck was 14 3 higher than that in drip irrigation di2 but no difference was found compared to furrow irrigation fi2 the wp under control group decreased by 20 5 p 0 001 and 10 1 p 0 052 compared to drip di2 and furrow irrigation fi2 respectively 3 3 mass concentration nutrient yield and nutrient water productivity the cmass and nwp of asa were not affected by irrigation method during summer cycle table 4 however compared with furrow irrigation fi1 the cmass of lycopene β carotene and total phenols increased by 10 8 14 5 and 21 4 under drip irrigation di1 respectively and the nwp increased by 8 5 12 1 and 18 9 respectively in terms of ny total phenols under drip irrigation di1 was 6 5 higher but lycopene was 2 8 lower than that under furrow irrigation fi1 respectively while other phytochemicals remained unchanged in the winter experiment the cmass of lycopene β carotene total phenols and asa increased by 12 7 12 2 15 5 and 19 9 under drip irrigation di2 respectively the ny increased by 12 6 12 1 15 4 and 19 8 respectively and the nwp increased by 27 5 26 9 30 7 and 35 7 respectively compared with furrow irrigation fi2 for control group the cmass ny and nwp of phytochemicals improved significantly compared with furrow irrigation fi2 except for asa however the nwp of phytochemicals was lower than those in drip irrigation di2 even though the cmass was higher in the summer experiment the cmass ny and nwp of taa in drip irrigation di1 were 14 5 24 5 0 5 9 3 and 12 1 22 0 higher than those in furrow irrigation fi1 table 4 respectively which determined by different assays in the winter experiment the dpph assay showed the cmass ny and nwp of taa under drip irrigation di2 increased significantly by 50 6 50 5 and 70 3 respectively compared with furrow irrigation fi2 the results of frap assay 9 9 9 8 and 24 3 under drip irrigation were similar to those in dpph assay while the teac assay showed completely opposite response 11 8 11 3 and 0 4 under drip irrigation in addition the cmass ny and nwp of taa under control group were significantly higher than those under drip di2 and furrow irrigation fi2 frap assay or lay somewhere in between dpph assay or similar with each other teac assay 3 4 contribution to human nutrition for the summer experiment every 200 g fresh tomato fruit under drip irrigation di1 could meet 97 9 16 3 0 9 21 5 and 2 4 4 5 of the daily nutritional requirements for lycopene β carotene total phenols asa and taa respectively which were higher than those 88 4 14 3 0 7 20 8 and 2 1 3 8 respectively under furrow irrigation fi1 even though no significant difference was found in asa fig 4 for winter experiment per 200 g fresh tomato fruits from drip irrigation di2 could meet 90 2 15 4 0 8 25 1 and 1 5 4 1 of daily requirements for the nutrients aforementioned respectively which were higher than those 80 0 13 7 0 6 20 9 and 1 3 3 0 respectively in furrow irrigation fi2 while no significant difference was found in β carotene and taa determined by teac and frap assays in addition the percentage contribution to human nutrition for lycopene β carotene total phenols and taa frap assay in control group were significantly higher than those in drip di2 and furrow irrigation fi2 3 5 farmland and water resource utilization in tomato production compared with furrow irrigation the farmland employed for the greenhouse tomato production to satisfy the human annual nutritional requirements was generally less under drip irrigation except for lycopene and asa in summer cycle and teac in winter cycle table 5 furthermore the amount of water that consumed to produce adequate nutrition was significantly lower under drip irrigation in our experiment except asa in summer cycle and teac in winter cycle in terms of control group ck less farmland and water resources were consumed for greenhouse tomato production compared with furrow irrigation fi2 apart from the teac however in general less farmland and more water amount were needed in control group compared with drip irrigation di2 4 discussions drip irrigation method employs localized application of water in the plant root zone without irrigating the non cropped area karlberg et al 2007 therefore a smaller designed soil wetting proportion p 0 5 was used in drip irrigation which account for the lower total irrigation amount soil moisture content and etc compared with furrow irrigation table 1 the lower etc under drip irrigation was a direct result of the less water uptake transportation by plants and implied the plants suffered from a certain degree of water stress the irrigation schedule of ck was the same as that of furrow irrigation fi2 which explains the equal results of total irrigation amount and etc of both treatments however the average soil moisture content in control group was slightly higher this could be the result of a more uniform distribution of soil water kumar and dey 2011 less water uptake and seepage loss above the planned depth of wetted soil layer 50 cm compared with treatment fi2 li et al 2020 and might relate to the enhanced soil water storage capacity tiwari et al 1998 the microclimate within crop canopy or near soil surface is strongly affected by irrigation methods kueppers and snyder 2012 xu et al 2017 especially in closed or semi closed agricultural systems such as solar greenhouses more energy that intercepted by underlying surface was partitioned into sensible heat under drip irrigation which was determined by the interactions between plants and environment and should account for the variations in environment between drip and furrow irrigation methods fig 3 as explained in our previous publication li et al 2020 for the winter cycle the solar energy received by greenhouse was less and the exchange of energy inside and outside the greenhouse was also reduced due to insulation during night for the purpose of heat preservation resulting in smaller differences in environment among treatments the control group had more similar environment as furrow irrigation fi2 rather than drip irrigation di2 because the energy partitioning on the underlying surface was strongly related to crop water consumption zhou et al 2012 li et al 2020 the specific environment generated under different irrigation methods figs 2 and 3 could have affected the division expansion and differentiation of tissue cells plant growth and development metabolism and other physiological and biochemical processes bertin and genard 2018 bisbis et al 2018 toscano et al 2019 which ultimately could have determined the yield productivity and quality of tomato fruits 4 1 yield components of tomato the total yield of tomato fruits in our study table 3 was comparable to the reports in field 89 6 175 0 t hm2 sun et al 2018 zheng et al 2013 and solar greenhouse experiments 102 2 187 2 t hm2 chen et al 2013 wang et al 2015 which conducted in the same experimental station fruit number and single fruit fresh weight are two important factors for yield components results showed that the difference in total yield between drip and furrow irrigation was mainly attributed to the variation in single fruit fresh weight similar to the report of chen et al 2013 ritchie 2015 also argued that plant differentiation quantitative increase in size was more sensitive than development fruit setting to abiotic stresses other than temperature and light the fruit fresh weight is the result of the balance between the inflow and loss of water and photoassimilate reflecting the change of net water accumulation in fruit bertin and genard 2018 the environment generated under drip irrigation high air and soil temperature high vpd and low soil moisture content figs 2 and 3 probably reduced both the plant water uptake and phloem sap flow decreased the water potential gradient between fruit and stem and accelerate fruit maturation then declined the net water accumulation in tomato fruits compared with furrow irrigation gruda 2005 guichard et al 2005 lobell et al 2015 okello et al 2015 these explain the lower results of average single fruit fresh weight yield per plant and total yield under drip irrigation especially in summer cycle table 3 on the contrary the small demand of evapotranspiration and the similar environment among treatments in winter cycle making the effect of irrigation method on water accumulation in tomato fruits was minor so did the influence on both yield parameters regarding control group the exorbitant moisture content poor aeration and high temperature in rhizospheric soil environment resulting in the decrease of single fruit fresh weight li et al 2015 which also related to the lower plant water uptake zhang et al 2019 however due to the higher fruit number the average yield per plant and total yield in control group were similar to other treatments di2 and fi2 it is generally believed that water deficit reduces the number of fruits coyagocruz et al 2019 favati et al 2009 however some studies pointed out the variations in irrigation amount or methods under partial root zone drying zegbe et al 2004 or field conditions guida et al 2017 did not affect the tomato fruit number which supports our results abortion of flower and fruit is related to the limit of sink strength and reducing the inhibition of sink strength on photosynthesis is beneficial to tomato fruit setting ruan et al 2012 high temperature reduces fertility and number of pollen grains released in tomato plants sato et al 2000 hence increases the parthenocarpy which have weaker sink strength than normal tomato fruits sato et al 2001 therefore the minor competition for photoassimilate between unfertilized flowers and other sink organs under drip irrigation explains the similar results of fruit number compared with furrow irrigation which attribute to the smaller normal fruits table 3 and more parthenocarpy in the former malash et al 2008 also found that number of tomato fruits under drip irrigation was more but the fresh weight was lower compared with furrow irrigation 4 2 water productivity of tomato the wp of tomato in our study table 3 was comparable to that in field 28 6 55 8 kg m3 studies sun et al 2018 wei et al 2016 and solar greenhouse experiment 37 4 71 2 kg m3 qiu et al 2013 wang et al 2015 conducted in the same experimental station appropriate deficit irrigation strategies can improve the wp of tomato with marginal yield decrease kuscu et al 2014 yang et al 2019 however some reports indicated that deficit irrigation has no effect on wp of tomato zheng et al 2013 yang et al 2020b which support our results of summer experiment tomato plants are more sensitive to water shortage during blooming and fruit setting periods kuscu et al 2014 some studies showed that the deficit irrigation imposed in vegetative growth phase could increase tomato wp chen et al 2013 khapte et al 2019 while no effect on wp was found during other phenological phases of tomato lu et al 2019 which implied the water deficit during the vegetative growth phase is vital for improving tomato wp however for the purpose of the establishment of tomato seedlings fully irrigation was applied at dat 1 and 10 respectively for both treatments in our experiment fig 2 the soil water content was relative high during the vegetative growth phase until may 5 2017 in summer cycle until nov 30 2017 in winter cycle suggesting no tomato plants were suffered from the water stress therefore the water applied during this period was not beneficial for the improvement in tomato wp under drip irrigation in summer cycle moreover the tomato yield increased even without irrigation in the following weeks after transplanting when soil moisture was sufficient at the beginning ngouajio et al 2007 which also supported our view to some extent in contrast the wp of tomato under drip irrigation significantly improved in winter cycle as expected other important environmental factor for wp is vpd which is the key to determine whether deficit irrigation can impose a positive effect on tomato plants li et al 2019 the higher vpd limited the positive effect of drip irrigation on wp in summer compared with furrow irrigation while the opposite result was found in winter fig 3 and table 3 jiao et al 2019 also reported that the wp of tomato significantly increased under low vpd condition furthermore the effect of water insufficient on wp varied from negative to positive along with the prolongation of water stress which attributed to the acclimatization of plants caused by a series of changes in anatomy morphology and biochemistry gilbert and medina 2016 yu et al 2020 therefore the relatively longer growth period in winter seemed conducive to the further improvement in wp of tomato under drip irrigation 4 3 nutrient yield and nutrient water productivity of tomato improvements in ny under drip irrigation were not distinct in summer table 4 however the cmass of nutrients was higher compared to furrow irrigation in control group the increase in cmass of nutrients was not fully reflected in ny on the contrary the cmass and ny of nutrients under drip irrigation were both preferable to furrow irrigation in winter because total yield was similar between these treatments our results indicated that the ny of nutrients in tomato fruits was largely affected by yield which was on accord with the findings on lentils graham et al 2018 forage ren et al 2016 leafy vegetables nyathi et al 2018 and wheat moreira ascarrunz et al 2016 as a result for the ny compared with furrow irrigation the notable improvement in tomato fruit quality and health promoting value of tomato under drip irrigation was neutralized by the negative effect on total yield nevertheless our results show that by targeted steering of the irrigation the balance between yield and nutritional quality can be influenced eventually there is potential to reach high levels of ny in order to obtain adequate nutrition for people graham et al 2018 the concept of wp eq 4 is less suitable for horticultural crops because the value of their products is highly dependent on the crop quality zheng et al 2013 however nwp overcomes this shortcoming and links the water consumption productivity and quality of crops thereby shifting the focus of agricultural production from more food per drop to more nutrition per drop siwi and iwmi 2004 similar to the results of nyathi et al 2018 2019b we found that the nwp of most nutrients in tomato fruits significantly improved under drip irrigation table 4 both in summer and winter which implied that the higher efficiency of converting available water resources into product compared with furrow irrigation it should be pointed out that the improvement in nwp under drip irrigation mainly attributed to the increase in cmass of nutrients in summer which closely related to the environment in the greenhouse however for grain legumes that cultured in different locations the variations in nwp were mainly determined by yield chibarabada et al 2017 and the different physiological responses of grain legumes to environment and water might account for the confliction with our study therefore we propose that the concept of nwp should be an important criterion for the comparison of a broad range of crops with different productive potential for nutrients and biomass ny and nwp link up water and agricultural production strategies providing the possibility to settle the global food and nutrition security issues simultaneously under finite resource conditions chibarabada et al 2017 unfortunately the information on crop ny and nwp are still very limited and to the best of our knowledge there are no experimental studies on tomato on this respect therefore our results can provide a benchmark for further research but it is also difficult to currently compare with other reliable data 4 4 water agriculture nutrition human health nexus agricultural water use crop production nutritional requirements and human health are interlinked and are usually evaluated independently using different indicators mabhaudhi et al 2016 ny can provide useful information of water agriculture nutrition human health nexus and the united nations food and agriculture organization fao has developed an nwp methodology to enhance the understanding of the relationship between water and nutrition blas et al 2019 the results of percentage contribution to human nutrition showed that the drip irrigated tomato fruits can generally provide more nutrition compared with furrow irrigation by mass fig 4 the tomato variety cultured in this experiment has excellent potential in supplying the daily requirements of lycopene β carotene and asa for human however the demands for phenolic compounds and taa need to be supplemented from other food sources it should be pointed out that consuming any kind of food to satisfy the requirement of single nutrient may lead to huge even dangerous nutritional imbalance graham et al 2018 therefore the human should not obtain lycopene only from tomato notwithstanding the 200 g fresh fruits in our experiment can reach more than 0 8 times of the rdni for lycopene fig 4 in addition the nutrient dense tomato fruits under drip irrigation were also more beneficial to reduce the intake of carbohydrates moreira ascarrunz et al 2016 the utilization efficiency of farmland and water resources under drip irrigation was higher than furrow irrigation from the perspective of meeting human nutritional requirements by greenhouse tomato fruits table 5 the transformation i e from furrow to drip irrigation satisfying the pursuit of nutritious diets and healthy living for people and reducing the pressure on the environment brought by agricultural production charles et al 2010 foley et al 2011 which particularly important for the arid areas in northwest china however relying on tomato fruits alone is not an environment friendly choice for supplement the phenolic compounds and taa in diet regardless of irrigation methods we suggest that each aspect of the water agriculture nutrition human health nexus should be equally attended because the overemphasis of one item probably lead to neglect the interactions among the rest components in this linkage mabhaudhi et al 2016 5 conclusions in the summer experiment the single fruit fresh weight and yield of tomato under drip irrigation were significantly lower than those in furrow irrigation which accounted for no changes in wp the non beneficial irrigation during the tomato vegetative growth phase and the high vpd condition further limited the improvement in wp under drip irrigation however the tomato fruit quality was superior under drip irrigation thereby can provide more adequate nutrition for human beings nevertheless the commonly higher cmass of nutrients did not fully correspond to the increase in ny under drip irrigation while the nwp generally improved compared with furrow irrigation this implied that the ny was mainly determined by the yield while the nwp was mainly affected by the cmass in the winter experiment no significant difference was found in single fruit fresh weight and yield of tomato between drip and furrow irrigation which related to the similar environmental conditions while the wp ny and nwp were notably improved under drip irrigation in general drip irrigation improved tomato fruit quality in the greenhouse and that can offset the yield reduction and improve the potential and water use efficiency in nutrients production furthermore the consumption of farmland and water resources for greenhouse tomato production was generally lower under drip irrigation in summary drip irrigation can achieve a good balance between the yield and quality of tomato meanwhile reducing the pressure on environment hence should be further applied in the greenhouse in arid

10137,kiwifruit is widely recognized as a fruit crop sensitive to water stress due to low stomatal regulation unfortunately many of the most important kiwifruit producing areas have been affected by increasing water scarcity due to climate change protected cultivation may be used in kiwifruit vines not only to mitigate water stress and potential reductions in fruit quality but also to increase intrinsic water use efficiency at the beginning of fruit maturation two environmental conditions uncovered and covered with a transparent plastic covering were assessed in mature kiwifruit plants actinidia deliciosa chev cv hayward subjected to conventional and deficit irrigation regimes in san nicolás chile for two consecutive seasons the results showed that covered plants under deficit irrigation required twice the time to exhibit severe water stress levels 1 3 mpa than plants under open field conditions despite changes in solar radiation quantity and quality due to the transparent plastic covering differences in rates of water stress occurrence between cover treatments in deficit irrigated vines were not explained by differences in soil desiccation or stomatal conductance the delay in severe water stress onset led to considerable water savings and caused no reductions in either yield or fruit quality which increased water productivity between 21 and 71 fruit from covered plants subjected to deficit irrigation exhibited higher firmness at greater maturity 7 0 brix the increase in water productivity in severely water stressed kiwifruit vines when using late season plastic canopy cover confirms that protected cultivation can be an excellent tool to reduce the impact of limited irrigation in many kiwifruit producing areas affected by water scarcity keywords protected cultivation deficit irrigation actinidia deliciosa water productivity leaf water potential 1 introduction kiwifruit actinidia spp is a fruit crop originating in southern china de la fuente 1988 where wet and warm conditions due to the east asian monsoon prevail during the growing season these conditions have determined morphological characteristics typical of plants adapted to abundant water supply such as high leaf area miller et al 2001 and stomatal conductance moncalean et al 2007 infante et al 1994 therefore kiwifruit orchards require large quantities of water to maintain high yields when compared to other fruit crops thus irrigation requirements of kiwifruit vines trained on a pergola trellis have been estimated to be about 20 higher 10 000 m3 ha 1season 1 holzapfel et al 2000 than those of table grapevines using the same trellis system 8000 and 9000 m3 ha 1season 1 villagra et al 2014 during the last decade chile and other kiwifruit producing countries with mediterranean climate conditions have been experiencing progressive increases in air temperature and reductions in precipitation due to climate change boisier et al 2016 thus severe water stress during the growing season has become inevitable in many fruit producing areas which is particularly serious for kiwifruit as this crop is susceptible to water stress due to low stomatal regulation zhang et al 2018 judd et al 1989 and high vulnerability to cavitation at relatively low levels of water stress clearwater and clark 2003 the use of canopy covers as protection has gained popularity in many fresh fruit producing areas because this practice can minimize the impact of climatic adversities on fruit quality and yield olivares soto et al 2020 sotiropoulos et al 2014 rana et al 2004 although few studies have investigated the role of protected cultivation in plant water relations of fruit crops there is evidence that its use can decrease evapotranspiration of plants albright et al 1989 and increase intrinsic water use efficiency in several fruit crops da silva et al 2018 in citrus cohen et al 1997 reported that the use of dense shade netting under semi arid climate reduced transpiration rates by approximately 25 in contrast using a 50 shading red net in apple trees increased sap flow rates and tree water use compared to open field conditions boini et al 2019 in table grapes cultivars covering vineyards with a plastic film at veraison slightly increased stem water potential novello et al 2000 montanaro et al 2009 reported that a 50 decrease in solar radiation in water stressed kiwifruit plants resulted in a lower level of water stress 10 than uncovered plants one week after irrigation was applied and shade netting was used there is no comprehensive understanding of the role of protected cultivation as a water saving mitigation strategy in kiwifruit on the other hand several studies have reported that protected cultivation can change physiological parameters e g chlorophyll content stomatal conductance associated with improvements in photosynthetic efficiency in non arboreal fruit crops such as kiwifruit chiabrando and giacalone 2018 blueberry lobos et al 2012 and murta franck et al 2007 despite potential benefits in the photosynthetic capacity of fruit crops the role of protected cultivation on yield and fruit quality is still unclear for instance the use of plastic covers on yellow fleshed kiwifruit induced inconsistent effects on soluble solids concentration percentage of dry matter and pulp firmness among others chiabrando and giacalone 2018 we expect that protected cultivation will not only change atmospheric water demand as previously reported in the literature but it will also impact photochemistry and fruit growth and development due to changes in quality and quantity of solar radiation and air temperature therefore in this study we aim to investigate the combined effect of canopy covers and deficit irrigation on environmental variables linked to soil plant atmosphere water relations as well as physiological responses fruit yield and quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site and weather data this study was conducted in a commercial kiwifruit orchard actinidia deliciosa a chev c f liang and a r ferguson cv hayward in san nicolás 36 32 45 8 s 72 11 18 4 w ñuble region chile for two consecutive seasons 2018 2019 the kiwifruit vines were planted in 2006 at 4 0 m x 3 0 m spacing trained as an overhead pergola system with four 3 0 m cordons and fruiting canes placed every 0 2 m rows were laid out in a north south direction the orchard has had an average yield between 35 and 40 ton ha 1 during the last five years irrigation was applied by micro sprinklers using two emitters spaced 0 75 m apart at a flow rate of 30 l h 1 per plant the soil belongs to the talquipén series which is classified as a member of the fine loamy mixed mesic family of ultic haploxerolls and is characterized by low porosity fine textures and limited internal drainage ciren 1990 textures in the sites range from loam in the surface to clay loam with depth lateral flower buds were thinned manually before bloom to increase fruit size while fruit thinning was carried out after bloom to remove deformed fruits in 2019 a severe fruit thinning was applied approximately two weeks after the fruit set to reduce crop load by 30 and increase fruit size forchlorfenuron cppu a synthetic cytokinin was applied twice during the season 30 and 40 daf at a dose of 300 cc hl 1 to increase fruit size pest and weed management was conducted according to standard commercial practices for kiwifruit orchards 2 2 experimental design the experiment was performed in a completely randomized block design with four replicates and repeated measurements over two years the treatments were arranged in a split plot design where the main plot was the cover treatment and the subplot was the irrigation treatment two cover treatments covered and uncovered plants were applied from the end of stage i of fruit development corresponding to approximately 80 of final fruit size to leaf senescence the installation period for the plastic cover coincided with the cessation of shoot elongation and intended to improve plant water status as reported for table grapes by novello et al 2000 the uncovered plants remained under open field conditions throughout the whole season while a transparent plastic cover was installed above the canopy throughout the above mentioned period the transparent plastic cover was installed for 180 continuous days in both seasons from january 11th to july 10th and from january 17th to july 16th in 2018 and 2019 over a plot of thirty plants using a whitish low density polyethylene film of 180 µm thickness oroplus hals 180 plastik advanced srl bergamo italy the transparent plastic cover was installed 0 70 m above each of the three consecutive rows for each block treatment combination 10 pl row 1 two irrigation treatments were randomly applied within each main plot one week after the plastic cover was installed aiming to obtain significant differences in plant water status near the end of the growing season when water availability often reaches the minimum seasonal value control wet plants were irrigated to satisfy at least 100 etc throughout the whole season trying to maintain an average midday leaf water potential ψl above 1 0 mpa in the regulated deficit irrigation rdi treatment water was cut off until plants reached an average midday leaf water potential ψl of 1 3 mpa in 2018 irrigation was ceased from february 1st for 27 days in uncovered plants under rdi and 35 days in covered plants under rdi in 2019 irrigation was discontinued from february 5th for 27 and 38 days in uncovered and covered plants under rdi respectively after harvest commercial irrigation practices were resumed throughout the entirety of the orchard irrigation requirements were estimated based on the evapotranspiration for kiwifruit etc eto x kc the crop coefficients kc for kiwifruit used in this study from bud break to harvest were obtained from fao 56 allen et al 1998 2 3 environmental conditions rainfall and reference evapotranspiration were obtained from the san nicolás weather station agroclima weather network 36 31 4 3 s 72 5 40 9 w which is located about 10 km from the study site from october 1st to april 30th in 2018 and 2019 temperature and air relative humidity above the plant canopy were measured under covered and uncovered conditions from november 1st to april 30th in 2018 and from october 1st to april 30th in 2019 two air temperature and humidity probes hmp60 vaisala helsinki finland were installed at 0 5 m above the canopy in wet plants one probe was placed below the transparent plastic cover while the other was placed at open field conditions data were recorded with a sampling frequency of 5 min and used to estimate air vapor pressure deficit vpdair spectral radiation measurements were carried out at solar noon 12 00 13 00 h on january 30th using a dual spectrophotometry system stellarnet inc tampa fl usa which was configured to measure total irradiance in the wavelength range of the ultraviolet 323 400 nm visible 400 700 nm red 700 800 nm and infra red 950 1690 nm spectrums measurements were made below and above the plant canopy of covered and uncovered vines taking three samples per main plot the ratios of blue light 400 500 nm red 600 700 nm and red light 600 700 nm distant red 700 800 nm were calculated to estimate the activity of phytochromes and cryptochromes bastías and corelli grappadelli 2012 volumetric soil water content was measured in a single block in the deficit irrigated plants that were under a plastic cover and open canopy conditions from december 20th to march 15th in 2018 and 2019 capacitance sensors gs1 decagon devices pullman wa usa were installed between the emitters on the row at two depths 0 2 and 0 4 m and a distance of 0 3 m from the trunk data were recorded and stored every 15 min in a datalogger em5b decagon devices pullman wa usa volumetric water meters dishnon arad ltd dalia israel were installed at the beginning of each irrigation line in each subplot to estimate the amount of irrigated water from october 1st to april 30th in 2018 and 2019 photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd was measured weekly above and below the plant with a ceptometer lp 80 decagon instruments washington usa from november 1st to march 30th in both seasons data collection was carried out at noon with a sampling frequency of one measurement above the plant canopy and three measurements below the plant canopy above canopy ppfd was measured 50

m from the trunk 1 0 m above the soil surface leaf and fruit temperatures were measured weekly with a portable infrared thermometer fluke 62 max fluke corporation everett wa usa on the same plants where plant water status was measured a sample of five shaded and mature leaves and five young fruits from the bottom segment of a randomly selected fruitful shoot were selected per plant and readings were taken by distancing the infrared thermometer at 5 0 cm from the sample which is expected to accurately represent the surface temperature of an area of 10 cm2 2 4 plant water status physiology and growth plant water stress levels were determined weekly from december 15th to march 20th in 2018 and from december 1st to april 5th in 2019 by measuring midday leaf water potential ψl on two leaves per sampled plant in each subplot measurements were taken between 12 00 and 15 30 h using a pressure chamber pms 615 pms instruments washington usa leaf samples for this measurement were obtained from the upper third of the canopy preferably selecting mature leaves with no visual symptoms of biotic or abiotic stress according to the methodology described by mccutchan and shackel 1992 the number of samples used to determine ψl was established based on a statistical power analysis at the beginning of the first season data not shown stomatal conductance was measured with a steady state porometer sc 1 decagon instruments washington usa in both seasons photosystem ii efficiency was determined with a portable chlorophyll fluorescence meter pocket pea hansatech instruments norfolk uk in 2019 both measurements were conducted at midday once a week employing the same selection criteria used for ψl determinations during the same period to determine photosystem ii efficiency leaves were adapted to darkness for 30 min before the original fluorescence fo and maximum fluorescence fm measurements liang et al 2019 photosystem ii efficiency fv fm was calculated with the following formula fv fm fm fo fm for shoot growth measurements six shoots per plant were selected at random and marked shoot length and the number of leaves were recorded weekly starting from fruit set to harvest second week of november to the second week of april during the second season defoliation at harvest was evaluated for this six fruiting canes per plant were marked at the beginning of the season and their leaves were counted weekly until the fruit was harvested defoliation percentage dp was obtained using the following formula dp 100 nlf nlh where nlf is the number of leaves at fruit set and nlh is the number of leaves at harvest 2 5 water productivity and intrinsic water use efficiency at harvest approximately 140 daa a 10 fruit sample was randomly taken from the upper canopy of two vines from each experimental unit to estimate intrinsic water use efficiency wuei measured as differences in carbon isotope ratio δ13c as proposed by bchir et al 2016 sampled fruits were fully developed in size and maturity once fruits were collected they were dried in an oven at 70 c until there was no sample weight reduction dried samples were ground and sieved to obtain a homogeneous fine powder stable carbon isotopic ratios 13c were determined using an ea gsl gas preparation module sercon uk coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer 20 22 irms sercon uk an ultra grade reference gas ultra high grade co2 linde group was injected before each analytical run for co2 drift correction a calibrated laboratory standard corn flour scc2256 sercon uk was run every ten analytical samples a standard sample was checked every ten analytical samples as an internal check for analytical quality the stable carbon isotope composition δ13c for each sample was determined with the following equation brugnoli and farquhar 2000 farquhar et al 1989 δ c 13 c 13 c 12 s a m p l e c 13 c 12 s tan d a r d c 13 c 12 s tan d a r d x 1000 where 13c 12c sample and 13c 12c standard are the measured 13c 12c ratios for the leaf sample and the pdb standard pee dee belemnite respectively water productivity was estimated as the product of the ratio between water applied irrigation precipitation from bud break to harvest m3 ha 1 and yield per hectare kg fruit ha 1 2 6 fruit maturity quality and yield estimates soluble solids concentration and pulp firmness were measured once a week throughout the last stage of fruit development to determine an appropriate harvest date fruit samples consisted of 15 fruits per plant following the poke and grab sampling method rankine et al 1962 soluble solids concentration was measured using an optical refractometer atago hand refractometer atago tokyo japan pulp firmness was measured using a digital penetrometer with an 8 mm plunger fm200 pce instruments southampton uk pulp firmness was measured at the midpoint of the longest fruit side on opposite fruit sides before manually removing a skin section once harvest maturity was achieved 45 fruits per plant were sampled and divided into two subsamples the first subsample consisted of 30 fruits and was used to determine fruit size pulp firmness and soluble solid concentration the second subsample of 15 fruits was used to determine the percentage of dry matter dm for this a pulp slice of 2 3 mm thick was extracted manually from each fruit in its equatorial zone and its fresh and dry weight after drying the sample for 8 h at 60 c was recorded with an analytical balance 0 1 g ux6200h shimadzu japan the dm value was calculated as the ratio between the dry and fresh weight of each fruit slice the percentage of fruit affected by sunburn was estimated in six randomly selected fruiting canes per plant all the fruits of each fruiting cane were collected at harvest and the presence of sunburn was visually evaluated following the commercial standards of the chilean kiwifruit industry in this study the area affected by sunburn was used to classify fruits in the following four categories 1 no damage no visual symptom of sunburn 2 slight damage sunburn area is lower than 2 cm2 3 moderate damage sunburn area is higher than 2 cm2 and 4 severe damage necrotic tissue area is higher than 2 cm2 2 7

usa 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions very similar vpdair and ppfd were observed until the transparent plastic cover was installed in early january fig 1a and b once the plastic cover was installed there was a slight increase in vpd approximately 1 and a considerable decrease in ppfd values approximately 30 in the first season 2018 the vpdair remained at values close to 1 5 kpa between november and january in the second season 2019 vpdair showed a progressive increase that ranged between 1 4 and 1 8 kpa for the same period the maximum vpdair values were found in february for both seasons but there was a minor increase in vpdair values in 2018 due to cooler conditions the ppfd values remained close to 1500 µmol m 2 s 1 between november and january in both seasons but there were slightly higher values from november to march in 2018 a decrease in ppfd values was observed in both cover treatments from february ranging between 900 and 1000 µmol m 2 s 1 and between 1200 and 1500 µmol m 2 s 1 for the covered plants the use of the plastic cover reduced the total solar energy 323 1690 nm on average by 32 fig 2 however a greater reduction was observed for wavelengths at the longer spectrum range transmitted radiation through the plastic cover in the uv 320 400 nm the blue 400 500 nm the red 600 700 nm and the infrared light spectrums were 92 50 25 and 15 respectively of that measured in uncovered vines irrigation for the wet plants covered and uncovered was around 9800 m3 ha 1 in the first season while irrigation for the same treatment was reduced by approximately 30 during the second season table 1 cumulative etc under uncovered and well irrigated conditions was approximately 4 higher in 2018 than in 2019 reaching values close to 8000 m3 ha 1 data not shown regardless of the cover treatment the amount of applied water was lower in the plants under rdi however under rdi conditions covered plants received less irrigation water than those uncovered 26 and 12 respectively rainfall was higher in the first season and averaged 2697 m3 ha 1 the accumulated rainfall in covered plants was calculated up until the date in which the plastic cover was opened reaching 1530 for the first season and 1773 m3 ha 1 for the second season in the second season irrigation water for the wet treatment decreased by approximately 25 in general there was no clear impact of net cover or deficit irrigation on water productivity yet covered plants under rdi recorded the highest values in both seasons 6 53 and 4 19 kg m 3 in the first and second seasons 3 2 physiological responses despite the cover treatment ψl ranged between 0 8 and 0 6 mpa for the wet plants throughout the season in 2018 whereas there was a wider ψl range between 1 0 to 0 6 mpa for the wet plants in 2019 fig 3a b c and d covered plants under rdi required six weeks to reach about 1 3 mpa fig 3b and d while uncovered plants under the same irrigation treatment required four weeks to reach the same water stress level fig 3a and c in the first season uncovered plants under rdi exhibited two periods of water stress fig 3a while in the second season only one period of water stress was observed fig 3c to characterize soil desiccation patterns under covered and uncovered conditions volumetric soil water content was monitored only in deficit irrigated plants results showed that the decrease in the average value of the volumetric soil water content was not different between cover treatments once irrigation was cutoff in rdi plants in january fig 4a and b regardless of the cover treatment the soil reached a similar minimum value of volumetric water content 0 27 m3 m 3 in both seasons the largest treatment difference in soil water content 0 08 m3 m 3 in 2018 and 0 10 m3 m 3 in 2019 was observed when irrigation was resumed in uncovered plants which happened when those plants reached an average ψl of 1 2 mpa stomatal conductance leaf and fruit temperature and defoliation percentage were similar for both cover treatments in 2018 and 2019 table 2 no significant differences in irrigation treatments were found in stomatal conductance leaf temperature and transmitted ppfd in 2019 fruit temperature was higher by 0 7 c and the percentage of defoliation was higher by 24 1 in rdi plants table 3 higher fv fm values were generally observed in covered compared to uncovered plants but significant differences were only detected in two out of seven measurements fig 5a on the other hand no differences were found in fv fm between irrigation treatments fig 5b while the δ13c analysis showed less negative values in covered plants in 2019 fig 6a similar δ13c values were found between irrigation treatments fig 6b 3 3 yield estimates and fruit quality the analysis of the yield estimates showed no differences between cover and irrigation treatments in both seasons table 4 the number of fruits per plant ranged between 497 and 573 for the first season and between 274 and 437 for the second season during the first season the average yield was 48 1 ton ha 1 while in the second season was 29 3 ton ha 1 on average fruit number fruit weight and yield showed a reduction of 36 5 and 39 respectively during the second season the use of the plastic cover did not result in significant or consistent differences for the majority of the evaluated fruit quality parameters at harvest such as brix pulp firmness and polar and equatorial fruit diameter table 5 in 2019 the percentage of dry matter was slightly higher 0 5 in covered plants the percentage of moderate sunburn damage was the only consistent effect of cover treatment on fruit quality as covered plants showed less fruit damaged by sunburn than uncovered plants 14 in 2018 and 23 in 2019 similarly irrigation showed almost no impact on fruit quality as similar values of brix firmness and polar diameter were found in both irrigation treatments table 6 the fruits of plants under rdi exhibited about 1 0 more dry matter content than wet plants during the first season but this was not observed during the second season as both treatments were similar the most consistent effects of deficit irrigation on fruit quality were a 5 reduction in the equatorial diameter and an increase between 14 and 24 in the percentage of mild sunburn damage in 2019 58 of fruits from rdi plants were damaged by sunburn despite the lack of influence of cover and irrigation treatments on pulp firmness at harvest the relationship between brix and firmness was not the same for each cover irrigation combination fig 7 the decrease in fruit firmness associated with an increase in soluble solids concentration was similar in all the treatments up to 5 5 brix above this value fruit from covered plants subjected to rdi maintained their firmness while the other treatments continued the decrease in fruit firmness 4 discussion the results of this study provide evidence to sustain that protected cultivation as a water stress relief strategy is effective the use of late season plastic cover modified key environmental variables affecting plant water relations and photosynthetic efficiency nevertheless covered plants had a different water status response in magnitude and consistency to both irrigation treatments for instance under wet conditions ψl from covered and uncovered plants varied from mild water stress to optimum water status 0 8 to 0 5 mpa judd et al 1989 even in months when the orchard reached the highest evaporative demand of the season january and february the low sensitivity of ψl of well irrigated vines to larger atmospheric water demand is consistent with the high whole plant hydraulic conductance of kiwifruit at optimum water conditions dichio et al 2013 conversely under rdi conditions covered plants required twice as long as uncovered plants to reach severe levels of water stress 1 2 mpa 35 v s 14 days respectively despite the faster decrease in ψl of uncovered plants under rdi both covered and uncovered kiwifruit vines exhibited a similar reduction in soil water content as soon as irrigation was cut off reaching the minimum soil water content of 0 3 m3 m 3 in three weeks fig 4 thus it seems unlikely that the observed effect of the transparent plastic cover on ψl at different irrigation treatments is linked to water availability similarly minor changes in vpdair due to the plastic cover s use seems to have no impact on the slower reduction in ψl of covered deficit irrigated plants as covered plants were exposed to slightly higher vpdair than uncovered plants other factors such as the high vulnerability of kiwifruit vines to cavitation at relatively low water stress and the absence of an efficient embolism repair mechanism clearwater and clark 2003 may have accelerated leaf dehydration and ψl reduction in uncovered deficit irrigated plants besides the explanation mentioned above the ppfd reduction in the cover treatment may have also reduced the vulnerability of leaves to cavitation and hence delayed the drop in ψl these results confirm the high susceptibility of actinidia plants to water stress related hydraulic impairments under mediterranean environmental conditions as proposed by dichio et al 2013 the plastic cover had no impact on red far red and blue red light ratios which may explain why phytochrome and cryptochrome mediated responses such as stomatal conductance and shoot length bastías and corelli grappadelli 2012 were similar for both cover treatments however the efficiency of photosystem ii ps ii estimated as fv fm tended to be higher in covered plants fig 5 probably reflecting the effect of a 44 reduction in uv transmission 320 400 nm on the photoinhibition of leaves verdaguer et al 2017 pfündel 2003 the analysis of δ13c ratios indicated that wuei was slightly higher in covered plants regardless of the irrigation strategy as δ13c was 0 7 less negative in mature fruits from covered plants in the present study stomatal conductance was not affected by the plastic covering which means that the slight increase in wuei in covered plants evidenced by δ13c signatures could be linked to reduced ps ii photoinhibition i e higher fv fm damage of the ps ii is repaired at the expense of carbon energy chow and aro 2005 thus variation in carbon dynamics i e δ13c under the plastic cover may be due to changes in the whole plant source sink balance and carbohydrate availability induced by the reduction of photoinhibition of ps ii adams iii william et al 2013 therefore a potential increase in fixed co2 consumption in covered kiwifruit plants might have raised the consumption of 13c and seasonal fruit δ13c signatures compared to the uncovered plants conversely no significant increase in ps ii efficiency and wuei was observed at the rdi treatment as fruits from plants under both irrigation treatments showed the same fv fm and δ13c values at harvest the low sensitivity of stomata to rdi is most likely linked to the lack of an irrigation effect on wuei as differences in δ13c are partially determined by differences in stomatal aperture in which higher discrimination against 13c occurs when stomata are fully open farquhar et al 1989 cover and irrigation treatments showed no effect on the number of fruits per plant even though both treatments induced microclimatic changes at least two weeks before the flower bud induction process was completed which occurred when fruits reached 90 of the final size 1st week of february pratt and reid 1974 the 40 reduction in yield observed during the second season was caused by the application of severe fruit thinning a couple of weeks after the fruit set although the objective of that cultural practice was to increase fruit size there was no improvement in fresh fruit weight in 2019 this confirms that in kiwifruit fruit thinning after fruit set has a limited impact on fruit size xiloyannis et al 1999 water supply reduction for several weeks had no impact on yield confirming the low sensitivity of the reproductive growth of fruit lianas to late water deficit as reported by calderon orellana et al 2019 for table grapes therefore our experiment showed that rdi improved water productivity which was between 21 and 71 higher than that found under conventional crop management i e uncovered wet plants considering the expected high seasonal variability in water productivity an improvement of this parameter is key for kiwifruit production as this widely recognized high water demanding fruit crop is currently grown in areas severely affected by water scarcity the use of the transparent plastic covering reduced the emission of radiation by 33 in the near infra red spectrum 750 1100 nm from the plant canopy to the atmosphere fig 1 which explained the higher air temperature above covered vines 2 c however the absence of differences in canopy and fruit temperature between covered and uncovered plants may explain why maturity parameters that have been reported to be sensitive to air temperature in kiwifruit such as the concentration of soluble solids and the percentage of dry matter burdon et al 2007 tended to be similar for both cover treatments about a 20 reduction in moderate fruit sunburn was observed in covered plants which is linked to a 32 reduction in incoming solar radiation a reduction in sunburn incidence is of paramount importance in kiwifruit as sunburn not only reduces the cosmetic fruit value but also has been associated with greater colonization rates of alternaria spp sommer et al 1983 although covered plants showed no impact on fruit firmness at harvest in the second season the relationship between the concentration of soluble solids and firmness was not the same for each cover irrigation treatment combination while covered plants under rdi maintained high values of fruit firmness 19 lb at high brix 7 brix the remaining treatments showed a linear decrease in firmness as brix increased above 6 0 the maintenance of fruit firmness at higher maturity was probably seen only in covered deficit irrigated plants because moderate water stress levels between 1 0 and 0 8 mpa were maintained for a longer period than in uncovered deficit irrigated plants in which severe water stress was reached in only two weeks these results also illustrate that the role of water stress on fruit firmness is still unclear regardless of previous findings reporting higher firmness in fruit from deficit irrigated kiwifruit plants during cold storage currie et al 2008 furthermore these results suggest that the combined use of protected cultivation and rdi may allow harvesting at higher maturity with no firmness reduction in contrast to several studies that found higher brix and dry mater in deficit irrigated kiwifruit vines currie et al 2008 the results observed in this study showed irrigation had no consistent effects on fruit maturity however plants under deficit irrigation had smaller fruit equatorial diameter in both seasons this was probably associated with severe water stress during stage iii of fruit development when the rate of lateral fruit growth was the highest of the season water stress induced reduction in equatorial fruit diameter may be beneficial for growers since long fruits are more valuable than round fruits in the kiwifruit market nevertheless the greater percentage of defoliation observed in 2019 and the higher fruit damage by sunburn in deficit irrigated vines may indicate that the levels of water stress reached in this study were too severe for kiwifruit 5 conclusions despite expectations of reduced atmospheric water demand under covered conditions our results showed that solar radiation was more affected by the plastic covering than air vapor pressure deficit in fact a slightly greater atmospheric water demand was measured under the plastic covering a considerable reduction in solar radiation in response to the installation of a transparent plastic cover induced small improvements in kiwifruit photochemistry such as increasing the efficiency of the photosystem ii and intrinsic water use efficiency nevertheless no consistent differences in fruit quality or yield were found between covering treatments therefore the main benefit of the plastic covering s late installation was a two week delay in the occurrence of severe water stress in deficit irrigated vines which may be of paramount importance for kiwifruit orchards established under mediterranean climate conditions the better water status of covered deficit irrigated vines seems to be related to a lower risk of hydraulic impairments rather than a significant reduction in soil desiccation these results suggest that plastic covers may only marginally reduce water usage yet using a transparent plastic cover may still save a substantial amount of water when combined with deficit irrigation furthermore the combined use of protected cultivation and regulated deficit irrigation seems promising since covered deficit irrigated plants exhibited a drop in fruit softening at higher maturity however deficit irrigated plants both covered and uncovered display greater fruit sunburn damage indicating that a water stress severity of 1 3 mpa may be harmful to kiwifruit the potential risk of applying an excessively severe water stress level to drought sensitive kiwifruit plants highlights the value of accurately measuring plant water status even in plastic covered orchards finally this study showed empirical evidence that protected cultivation is a water stress relief technique for kiwifruit plants grown under mediterranean climate conditions this is particularly relevant in the current climate change scenario in which water scarcity may induce considerable losses in yield and quality of kiwifruit a fruit crop that is widely known for its high water requirements and low tolerance to water stress declaration of competing interest the authors

10137,kiwifruit is widely recognized as a fruit crop sensitive to water stress due to low stomatal regulation unfortunately many of the most important kiwifruit producing areas have been affected by increasing water scarcity due to climate change protected cultivation may be used in kiwifruit vines not only to mitigate water stress and potential reductions in fruit quality but also to increase intrinsic water use efficiency at the beginning of fruit maturation two environmental conditions uncovered and covered with a transparent plastic covering were assessed in mature kiwifruit plants actinidia deliciosa chev cv hayward subjected to conventional and deficit irrigation regimes in san nicolás chile for two consecutive seasons the results showed that covered plants under deficit irrigation required twice the time to exhibit severe water stress levels 1 3 mpa than plants under open field conditions despite changes in solar radiation quantity and quality due to the transparent plastic covering differences in rates of water stress occurrence between cover treatments in deficit irrigated vines were not explained by differences in soil desiccation or stomatal conductance the delay in severe water stress onset led to considerable water savings and caused no reductions in either yield or fruit quality which increased water productivity between 21 and 71 fruit from covered plants subjected to deficit irrigation exhibited higher firmness at greater maturity 7 0 brix the increase in water productivity in severely water stressed kiwifruit vines when using late season plastic canopy cover confirms that protected cultivation can be an excellent tool to reduce the impact of limited irrigation in many kiwifruit producing areas affected by water scarcity keywords protected cultivation deficit irrigation actinidia deliciosa water productivity leaf water potential 1 introduction kiwifruit actinidia spp is a fruit crop originating in southern china de la fuente 1988 where wet and warm conditions due to the east asian monsoon prevail during the growing season these conditions have determined morphological characteristics typical of plants adapted to abundant water supply such as high leaf area miller et al 2001 and stomatal conductance moncalean et al 2007 infante et al 1994 therefore kiwifruit orchards require large quantities of water to maintain high yields when compared to other fruit crops thus irrigation requirements of kiwifruit vines trained on a pergola trellis have been estimated to be about 20 higher 10 000 m3 ha 1season 1 holzapfel et al 2000 than those of table grapevines using the same trellis system 8000 and 9000 m3 ha 1season 1 villagra et al 2014 during the last decade chile and other kiwifruit producing countries with mediterranean climate conditions have been experiencing progressive increases in air temperature and reductions in precipitation due to climate change boisier et al 2016 thus severe water stress during the growing season has become inevitable in many fruit producing areas which is particularly serious for kiwifruit as this crop is susceptible to water stress due to low stomatal regulation zhang et al 2018 judd et al 1989 and high vulnerability to cavitation at relatively low levels of water stress clearwater and clark 2003 the use of canopy covers as protection has gained popularity in many fresh fruit producing areas because this practice can minimize the impact of climatic adversities on fruit quality and yield olivares soto et al 2020 sotiropoulos et al 2014 rana et al 2004 although few studies have investigated the role of protected cultivation in plant water relations of fruit crops there is evidence that its use can decrease evapotranspiration of plants albright et al 1989 and increase intrinsic water use efficiency in several fruit crops da silva et al 2018 in citrus cohen et al 1997 reported that the use of dense shade netting under semi arid climate reduced transpiration rates by approximately 25 in contrast using a 50 shading red net in apple trees increased sap flow rates and tree water use compared to open field conditions boini et al 2019 in table grapes cultivars covering vineyards with a plastic film at veraison slightly increased stem water potential novello et al 2000 montanaro et al 2009 reported that a 50 decrease in solar radiation in water stressed kiwifruit plants resulted in a lower level of water stress 10 than uncovered plants one week after irrigation was applied and shade netting was used there is no comprehensive understanding of the role of protected cultivation as a water saving mitigation strategy in kiwifruit on the other hand several studies have reported that protected cultivation can change physiological parameters e g chlorophyll content stomatal conductance associated with improvements in photosynthetic efficiency in non arboreal fruit crops such as kiwifruit chiabrando and giacalone 2018 blueberry lobos et al 2012 and murta franck et al 2007 despite potential benefits in the photosynthetic capacity of fruit crops the role of protected cultivation on yield and fruit quality is still unclear for instance the use of plastic covers on yellow fleshed kiwifruit induced inconsistent effects on soluble solids concentration percentage of dry matter and pulp firmness among others chiabrando and giacalone 2018 we expect that protected cultivation will not only change atmospheric water demand as previously reported in the literature but it will also impact photochemistry and fruit growth and development due to changes in quality and quantity of solar radiation and air temperature therefore in this study we aim to investigate the combined effect of canopy covers and deficit irrigation on environmental variables linked to soil plant atmosphere water relations as well as physiological responses fruit yield and quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site and weather data this study was conducted in a commercial kiwifruit orchard actinidia deliciosa a chev c f liang and a r ferguson cv hayward in san nicolás 36 32 45 8 s 72 11 18 4 w ñuble region chile for two consecutive seasons 2018 2019 the kiwifruit vines were planted in 2006 at 4 0 m x 3 0 m spacing trained as an overhead pergola system with four 3 0 m cordons and fruiting canes placed every 0 2 m rows were laid out in a north south direction the orchard has had an average yield between 35 and 40 ton ha 1 during the last five years irrigation was applied by micro sprinklers using two emitters spaced 0 75 m apart at a flow rate of 30 l h 1 per plant the soil belongs to the talquipén series which is classified as a member of the fine loamy mixed mesic family of ultic haploxerolls and is characterized by low porosity fine textures and limited internal drainage ciren 1990 textures in the sites range from loam in the surface to clay loam with depth lateral flower buds were thinned manually before bloom to increase fruit size while fruit thinning was carried out after bloom to remove deformed fruits in 2019 a severe fruit thinning was applied approximately two weeks after the fruit set to reduce crop load by 30 and increase fruit size forchlorfenuron cppu a synthetic cytokinin was applied twice during the season 30 and 40 daf at a dose of 300 cc hl 1 to increase fruit size pest and weed management was conducted according to standard commercial practices for kiwifruit orchards 2 2 experimental design the experiment was performed in a completely randomized block design with four replicates and repeated measurements over two years the treatments were arranged in a split plot design where the main plot was the cover treatment and the subplot was the irrigation treatment two cover treatments covered and uncovered plants were applied from the end of stage i of fruit development corresponding to approximately 80 of final fruit size to leaf senescence the installation period for the plastic cover coincided with the cessation of shoot elongation and intended to improve plant water status as reported for table grapes by novello et al 2000 the uncovered plants remained under open field conditions throughout the whole season while a transparent plastic cover was installed above the canopy throughout the above mentioned period the transparent plastic cover was installed for 180 continuous days in both seasons from january 11th to july 10th and from january 17th to july 16th in 2018 and 2019 over a plot of thirty plants using a whitish low density polyethylene film of 180 µm thickness oroplus hals 180 plastik advanced srl bergamo italy the transparent plastic cover was installed 0 70 m above each of the three consecutive rows for each block treatment combination 10 pl row 1 two irrigation treatments were randomly applied within each main plot one week after the plastic cover was installed aiming to obtain significant differences in plant water status near the end of the growing season when water availability often reaches the minimum seasonal value control wet plants were irrigated to satisfy at least 100 etc throughout the whole season trying to maintain an average midday leaf water potential ψl above 1 0 mpa in the regulated deficit irrigation rdi treatment water was cut off until plants reached an average midday leaf water potential ψl of 1 3 mpa in 2018 irrigation was ceased from february 1st for 27 days in uncovered plants under rdi and 35 days in covered plants under rdi in 2019 irrigation was discontinued from february 5th for 27 and 38 days in uncovered and covered plants under rdi respectively after harvest commercial irrigation practices were resumed throughout the entirety of the orchard irrigation requirements were estimated based on the evapotranspiration for kiwifruit etc eto x kc the crop coefficients kc for kiwifruit used in this study from bud break to harvest were obtained from fao 56 allen et al 1998 2 3 environmental conditions rainfall and reference evapotranspiration were obtained from the san nicolás weather station agroclima weather network 36 31 4 3 s 72 5 40 9 w which is located about 10 km from the study site from october 1st to april 30th in 2018 and 2019 temperature and air relative humidity above the plant canopy were measured under covered and uncovered conditions from november 1st to april 30th in 2018 and from october 1st to april 30th in 2019 two air temperature and humidity probes hmp60 vaisala helsinki finland were installed at 0 5 m

irrigated plants that were under a plastic cover and open canopy conditions from december 20th to march 15th in 2018 and 2019 capacitance sensors gs1 decagon devices pullman wa usa were installed between the emitters on the row at two depths 0 2 and 0 4 m and a distance of 0 3 m from the trunk data were recorded and stored every 15 min in a datalogger em5b decagon devices pullman wa usa volumetric water meters dishnon arad ltd dalia israel were installed at the beginning of each irrigation line in each subplot to estimate the amount of irrigated water from october 1st to april 30th in 2018 and 2019 photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd was measured weekly above and below the plant with a ceptometer lp 80 decagon instruments washington usa from november 1st to march 30th in both seasons data collection was carried out at noon with a sampling frequency of one measurement above the plant canopy and three measurements below the plant canopy above canopy ppfd was measured 50

where plant water status was measured a sample of five shaded and mature leaves and five young fruits from the bottom segment of a randomly selected fruitful shoot were selected per plant and readings were taken by distancing the infrared thermometer at 5 0 cm from the sample which is expected to accurately represent the surface temperature of an area of 10 cm2 2 4 plant water status physiology and growth plant water stress levels were determined weekly from december 15th to march 20th in 2018 and from december 1st to april 5th in 2019 by measuring midday leaf water potential ψl on two leaves per sampled plant in each subplot measurements were taken between 12 00 and 15 30 h using a pressure chamber pms 615 pms instruments washington usa leaf samples for this measurement were obtained from the upper third of the canopy preferably selecting mature leaves with no visual symptoms of biotic or abiotic stress according to the methodology described by mccutchan and shackel 1992 the number of samples used to determine ψl was established based on a statistical power analysis at the beginning of the first season data not shown stomatal conductance was measured with a steady state porometer sc 1 decagon instruments washington usa in both seasons photosystem ii efficiency was determined with a portable chlorophyll fluorescence meter pocket pea hansatech instruments norfolk uk in 2019 both measurements were conducted at midday once a week employing the same selection criteria used for ψl determinations during the same period to determine photosystem ii efficiency leaves were adapted to darkness for 30 min before the original fluorescence fo and maximum fluorescence fm measurements liang et al 2019 photosystem ii efficiency fv fm was calculated with the following formula fv fm fm fo fm for shoot growth measurements six shoots per plant were selected at random and marked shoot length and the number of leaves were recorded weekly starting from fruit set to harvest second week of november to the second week of april during the second season defoliation at harvest was evaluated for this six fruiting canes per plant were marked at the beginning of the season and their leaves were counted weekly until the fruit was harvested defoliation percentage dp was obtained using the following formula dp 100 nlf nlh where nlf is the number of leaves at fruit set and nlh is the number of leaves at harvest 2 5 water productivity and intrinsic water use efficiency at harvest approximately 140 daa a 10 fruit sample was randomly taken from the upper canopy of two vines from each experimental unit to estimate intrinsic water use efficiency wuei measured as differences in carbon isotope ratio δ13c as proposed by bchir et al 2016 sampled fruits were fully developed in size and maturity once fruits were collected they were dried in an oven at 70 c until there was no sample weight reduction dried samples were ground and sieved to obtain a homogeneous fine powder stable carbon isotopic ratios 13c were determined using an ea gsl gas preparation module sercon uk coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer 20 22 irms sercon uk an ultra grade reference gas ultra high grade co2 linde group was injected before each analytical run for co2 drift correction a calibrated laboratory standard corn flour scc2256 sercon uk was run every ten analytical samples a standard sample was checked every ten analytical samples as an internal check for analytical quality the stable carbon isotope composition δ13c for each sample was determined with the following equation brugnoli and farquhar 2000 farquhar et al 1989 δ c 13 c 13 c 12 s a m p l e c 13 c 12 s tan d a r d c 13 c 12 s tan d a r d x 1000 where 13c 12c sample and 13c 12c standard are the measured 13c 12c ratios for the leaf sample and the pdb standard pee dee belemnite respectively water productivity was estimated as the product of the ratio between water applied irrigation precipitation from bud break to harvest m3 ha 1 and yield per hectare kg fruit ha 1 2 6 fruit maturity quality and yield estimates soluble solids concentration and pulp firmness were measured once a week throughout the last stage of fruit development to determine an appropriate harvest date fruit samples consisted of 15 fruits per plant following the poke and grab sampling method rankine et al 1962 soluble solids concentration was measured using an optical refractometer atago hand refractometer atago tokyo japan pulp firmness was measured using a digital penetrometer with an 8 mm plunger fm200 pce instruments southampton uk pulp firmness was measured at the midpoint of the longest fruit side on opposite fruit sides before manually removing a skin section once harvest maturity was achieved 45 fruits per plant were sampled and divided into two subsamples the first subsample consisted of 30 fruits and was used to determine fruit size pulp firmness and soluble solid concentration the second subsample of 15 fruits was used to determine the percentage of dry matter dm for this a pulp slice of 2 3 mm thick was extracted manually from each fruit in its equatorial zone and its fresh and dry weight after drying the sample for 8 h at 60 c was recorded with an analytical balance 0 1 g ux6200h shimadzu japan the dm value was calculated as the ratio between the dry and fresh weight of each fruit slice the percentage of fruit affected by sunburn was estimated in six randomly selected fruiting canes per plant all the fruits of each fruiting cane were collected at harvest and the presence of sunburn was visually evaluated following the commercial standards of the chilean kiwifruit industry in this study the area affected by sunburn was used to classify fruits in the following four categories 1 no damage no visual symptom of sunburn 2 slight damage sunburn area is lower than 2 cm2 3 moderate damage sunburn area is higher than 2 cm2 and 4 severe damage necrotic tissue area is higher than 2 cm2 2 7 statistical analysis the data were subjected to an analysis of variance anova after testing for normality distribution shapiro wilk homogeneity of error variances levene s test and additivity tukey differences between means were determined using the lsd test alpha 0 05 all statistical analyzes were performed using the statistical software sas 9 4 sas studio university edition sas institute nc usa 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions very similar vpdair and ppfd were observed until the transparent plastic cover was installed in early january fig 1a and b once the plastic cover was installed there was a slight increase in vpd approximately 1 and a considerable decrease in ppfd values approximately 30 in the first season 2018 the vpdair remained at values close to 1 5 kpa between november and january in the second season 2019 vpdair showed a progressive increase that ranged between 1 4 and 1 8 kpa for the same period the maximum vpdair values were found in february for both seasons but there was a minor increase in vpdair values in 2018 due to cooler conditions the ppfd values remained close to 1500 µmol m 2 s 1 between november and january in both seasons but there were slightly higher values from november to march in 2018 a decrease in ppfd values was observed in both cover treatments from february ranging between 900 and 1000 µmol m 2 s 1 and between 1200 and 1500 µmol m 2 s 1 for the covered plants the use of the plastic cover reduced the total solar energy 323 1690 nm on average by 32 fig 2 however a greater reduction was observed for wavelengths at the longer spectrum range transmitted radiation through the plastic cover in the uv 320 400 nm the blue 400 500 nm the red 600 700 nm and the infrared light spectrums were 92 50 25 and 15 respectively of that measured in uncovered vines irrigation for the wet plants covered and uncovered was around 9800 m3 ha 1 in the first season while irrigation for the same treatment was reduced by approximately 30 during the second season table 1 cumulative etc under uncovered and well irrigated conditions was approximately 4 higher in 2018 than in 2019 reaching values close to 8000 m3 ha 1 data not shown regardless of the cover treatment the amount of applied water was lower in the plants under rdi however under rdi conditions covered plants received less irrigation water than those uncovered 26 and 12 respectively rainfall was higher in the first season and averaged 2697 m3 ha 1 the accumulated rainfall in covered plants was calculated up until the date in which the plastic cover was opened reaching 1530 for the first season and 1773 m3 ha 1 for the second season in the second season irrigation water for the wet treatment decreased by approximately 25 in general there was no clear impact of net cover or deficit irrigation on water productivity yet covered plants under rdi recorded the highest values in both seasons 6 53 and 4 19 kg m 3 in the first and second seasons 3 2 physiological responses despite the cover treatment ψl ranged between 0 8 and 0 6 mpa for the wet plants throughout the season in 2018 whereas there was a wider ψl range between 1 0 to 0 6 mpa for the wet plants in 2019 fig 3a b c and d covered plants under rdi required six weeks to reach about 1 3 mpa fig 3b and d while uncovered plants under the same irrigation treatment required four weeks to reach the same water stress level fig 3a and c in the first season uncovered plants under rdi exhibited two periods of water stress fig 3a while in the second season only one period of water stress was observed fig 3c to characterize soil desiccation patterns under covered and uncovered conditions volumetric soil water content was monitored only in deficit irrigated plants results showed that the decrease in the average value of the volumetric soil water content was not different between cover treatments once irrigation was cutoff in rdi plants in january fig 4a and b regardless of the cover treatment the soil reached a similar minimum value of volumetric water content 0 27 m3 m 3 in both seasons the largest treatment difference in soil water content 0 08 m3 m 3 in 2018 and 0 10 m3 m 3 in 2019 was observed when irrigation was resumed in uncovered plants which happened when those plants reached an average ψl of 1 2 mpa stomatal conductance leaf and fruit temperature and defoliation percentage were similar for both cover treatments in 2018 and 2019 table 2 no significant differences in irrigation treatments were found in stomatal conductance leaf temperature and transmitted ppfd in 2019 fruit temperature was higher by 0 7 c and the percentage of defoliation was higher by 24 1 in rdi plants table 3 higher fv fm values were generally observed in covered compared to uncovered plants but significant differences were only detected in two out of seven measurements fig 5a on the other hand no differences were found in fv fm between irrigation treatments fig 5b while the δ13c analysis showed less negative values in covered plants in 2019 fig 6a similar δ13c values were found between irrigation treatments fig 6b 3 3 yield estimates and fruit quality the analysis of the yield estimates showed no differences between cover and irrigation treatments in both seasons table 4 the number of fruits per plant ranged between 497 and 573 for the first season and between 274 and 437 for the second season during the first season the average yield was 48 1 ton ha 1 while in the second season was 29 3 ton ha 1 on average fruit number fruit weight and yield showed a reduction of 36 5 and 39 respectively during the second season the use of the plastic cover did not result in significant or consistent differences for the majority of the evaluated fruit quality parameters at harvest such as brix pulp firmness and polar and equatorial fruit diameter table 5 in 2019 the percentage of dry matter was slightly higher 0 5 in covered plants the percentage of moderate sunburn damage was the only consistent effect of cover treatment on fruit quality as covered plants showed less fruit damaged by sunburn than uncovered plants 14 in 2018 and 23 in 2019 similarly irrigation showed almost no impact on fruit quality as similar values of brix firmness and polar diameter were found in both irrigation treatments table 6 the fruits of plants under rdi exhibited about 1 0 more dry matter content than wet plants during the first season but this was not observed during the second season as both treatments were similar the most consistent effects of deficit irrigation on fruit quality were a 5 reduction in the equatorial diameter and an increase between 14 and 24 in the percentage of mild sunburn damage in 2019 58 of fruits from rdi plants were damaged by sunburn despite the lack of influence of cover and irrigation treatments on pulp firmness at harvest the relationship between brix and firmness was not the same for each cover irrigation combination fig 7 the decrease in fruit firmness associated with an increase in soluble solids concentration was similar in all the treatments up to 5 5 brix above this value fruit from covered plants subjected to rdi maintained their firmness while the other treatments continued the decrease in fruit firmness 4 discussion the results of this study provide evidence to sustain that protected cultivation as a water stress relief strategy is effective the use of late season plastic cover modified key environmental variables affecting plant water relations and photosynthetic efficiency nevertheless covered plants had a different water status response in magnitude and consistency to both irrigation treatments for instance under wet conditions ψl from covered and uncovered plants varied from mild water stress to optimum water status 0 8 to 0 5 mpa judd et al 1989 even in months when the orchard reached the highest evaporative demand of the season january and february the low sensitivity of ψl of well irrigated vines to larger atmospheric water demand is consistent with the high whole plant hydraulic conductance of kiwifruit at optimum water conditions dichio et al 2013 conversely under rdi conditions covered plants required twice as long as uncovered plants to reach severe levels of water stress 1 2 mpa 35 v s 14 days respectively despite the faster decrease in ψl of uncovered plants under rdi both covered and uncovered kiwifruit vines exhibited a similar reduction in soil water content as soon as irrigation was cut off reaching the minimum soil water content of 0 3 m3 m 3 in three weeks fig 4 thus it seems unlikely that the observed effect of the transparent plastic cover on ψl at different irrigation treatments is linked to water availability similarly minor changes in vpdair due to the plastic cover s use seems to have no impact on the slower reduction in ψl of covered deficit irrigated plants as covered plants were exposed to slightly higher vpdair than uncovered plants other factors such as the high vulnerability of kiwifruit vines to cavitation at relatively low water stress and the absence of an efficient embolism repair mechanism clearwater and clark 2003 may have accelerated leaf dehydration and ψl reduction in uncovered deficit irrigated plants besides the explanation mentioned above the ppfd reduction in the cover treatment may have also reduced the vulnerability of leaves to cavitation and hence delayed the drop in ψl these results confirm the high susceptibility of actinidia plants to water stress related hydraulic impairments under mediterranean environmental conditions as proposed by dichio et al 2013 the plastic cover had no impact on red far red and blue red light ratios which may explain why phytochrome and cryptochrome mediated responses such as stomatal conductance and shoot length bastías and corelli grappadelli 2012 were similar for both cover treatments however the efficiency of photosystem ii ps ii estimated as fv fm tended to be higher in covered plants fig 5 probably reflecting the effect of a 44 reduction in uv transmission 320 400 nm on the photoinhibition of leaves verdaguer et al 2017 pfündel 2003 the analysis of δ13c ratios indicated that wuei was slightly higher in covered plants regardless of the irrigation strategy as δ13c was 0 7 less negative in mature fruits from covered plants in the present study stomatal conductance was not affected by the plastic covering which means that the slight increase in wuei in covered plants evidenced by δ13c signatures could be linked to reduced ps ii photoinhibition i e higher fv fm damage of the ps ii is repaired at the expense of carbon energy chow and aro 2005 thus variation in carbon dynamics i e δ13c under the plastic cover may be due to changes in the whole plant source sink balance and carbohydrate availability induced by the reduction of photoinhibition of ps ii adams iii william et al 2013 therefore a potential increase in fixed co2 consumption in covered kiwifruit plants might have raised the consumption of 13c and seasonal fruit δ13c signatures compared to the uncovered plants conversely no significant increase in ps ii efficiency and wuei was observed at the rdi treatment as fruits from plants under both irrigation treatments showed the same fv fm and δ13c values at harvest the low sensitivity of stomata to rdi is most likely linked to the lack of an irrigation effect on wuei as differences in δ13c are partially determined by differences in stomatal aperture in which higher discrimination against 13c occurs when stomata are fully open farquhar et al 1989 cover and irrigation treatments showed no effect on the number of fruits per plant even though both treatments induced microclimatic changes at least two weeks before the flower bud induction process was completed which occurred when fruits reached 90 of the final size 1st week of february pratt and reid 1974 the 40 reduction in yield observed during the second season was caused by the application of severe fruit thinning a couple of weeks after the fruit set although the objective of that cultural practice was to increase fruit size there was no improvement in fresh fruit weight in 2019 this confirms that in kiwifruit fruit thinning after fruit set has a limited impact on fruit size xiloyannis et al 1999 water supply reduction for several weeks had no impact on yield confirming the low sensitivity of the reproductive growth of fruit lianas to late water deficit as reported by calderon orellana et al 2019 for table grapes therefore our experiment showed that rdi improved water productivity which was between 21 and 71 higher than that found under conventional crop management i e uncovered wet plants considering the expected high seasonal variability in water productivity an improvement of this parameter is key for kiwifruit production as this widely recognized high water demanding fruit crop is currently grown in areas severely affected by water scarcity the use of the transparent plastic covering reduced the emission of radiation by 33 in the near infra red spectrum 750 1100 nm from the plant canopy to the atmosphere fig 1 which explained the higher air temperature above covered vines 2 c however the absence of differences in canopy and fruit temperature between covered and uncovered plants may explain why maturity parameters that have been reported to be sensitive to air temperature in kiwifruit such as the concentration of soluble solids and the percentage of dry matter burdon et al 2007 tended to be similar for both cover treatments about a 20 reduction in moderate fruit sunburn was observed in covered plants which is linked to a 32 reduction in incoming solar radiation a reduction in sunburn incidence is of paramount importance in kiwifruit as sunburn not only reduces the cosmetic fruit value but also has been associated with greater colonization rates of alternaria spp sommer et al 1983 although covered plants showed no impact on fruit firmness at harvest in the second season the relationship between the concentration of soluble solids and firmness was not the same for each cover irrigation treatment combination while covered plants under rdi maintained high values of fruit firmness 19 lb at high brix 7 brix the remaining treatments showed a linear decrease in firmness as brix increased above 6 0 the maintenance of fruit firmness at higher maturity was probably seen only in covered deficit irrigated plants because moderate water stress levels between 1 0 and 0 8 mpa were maintained for a longer period than in uncovered deficit irrigated plants in which severe water stress was reached in only two weeks these results also illustrate that the role of water stress on fruit firmness is still unclear regardless of previous findings reporting higher firmness in fruit from deficit irrigated kiwifruit plants during cold storage currie et al 2008 furthermore these results suggest that the combined use of protected cultivation and rdi may allow harvesting at higher maturity with no firmness reduction in contrast to several studies that found higher brix and dry mater in deficit irrigated kiwifruit vines currie et al 2008 the results observed in this study showed irrigation had no consistent effects on fruit maturity however plants under deficit irrigation had smaller fruit equatorial diameter in both seasons this was probably associated with severe water stress during stage iii of fruit development when the rate of lateral fruit growth was the highest of the season water stress induced reduction in equatorial fruit diameter may be beneficial for growers since long fruits are more valuable than round fruits in the kiwifruit market nevertheless the greater percentage of defoliation observed in 2019 and the higher fruit damage by sunburn in deficit irrigated vines may indicate that the levels of water stress reached in this study were too severe for kiwifruit 5 conclusions despite expectations of reduced atmospheric water demand under covered conditions our results showed that solar radiation was more affected by the plastic covering than air vapor pressure deficit in fact a slightly greater atmospheric water demand was measured under the plastic covering a considerable reduction in solar radiation in response to the installation of a transparent plastic cover induced small improvements in kiwifruit photochemistry such as increasing the efficiency of the photosystem ii and intrinsic water use efficiency nevertheless no consistent differences in fruit quality or yield were found between covering treatments therefore the main benefit of the plastic covering s late installation was a two week delay in the occurrence of severe water stress in deficit irrigated vines which may be of paramount importance for kiwifruit orchards established under mediterranean climate conditions the better water status of covered deficit irrigated vines seems to be related to a lower risk of hydraulic impairments rather than a significant reduction in soil desiccation these results suggest that plastic covers may only marginally reduce water usage yet using a transparent plastic cover may still save a substantial amount of water when combined with deficit irrigation furthermore the combined use of protected cultivation and regulated deficit irrigation seems promising since covered deficit irrigated plants exhibited a drop in fruit softening at higher maturity however deficit irrigated plants both covered and uncovered display greater fruit sunburn damage indicating that a water stress severity of 1 3 mpa may be harmful to kiwifruit the potential risk of applying an excessively severe water stress level to drought sensitive kiwifruit plants highlights the value of accurately measuring plant water status even in plastic covered orchards finally this study showed empirical evidence that protected cultivation is a water stress relief technique for kiwifruit plants grown under mediterranean climate conditions this is particularly relevant in the current climate change scenario in which water scarcity may induce considerable losses in yield and quality of kiwifruit a fruit crop that is widely known for its high water requirements and low tolerance to water stress declaration of competing interest the authors

10138,future climate change is predicted to increase precipitation volume in sweden and also to modify precipitation patterns and produce more intense rainfall events this study examined the impact of such changes in three small swedish watersheds dominated by agricultural land the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to investigate the relationship between changes in precipitation monthly and daily and monthly water partitioning between runoff soil water content and evapotranspiration a climate ensemble produced from representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios 4 5 and 8 5 and five different global climate models regionalized by the swedish regional climate model rca4 was used to feed the swat model the results showed similar outcomes for the three sites with an increase in total monthly precipitation often associated with an increase in high daily rainfall events increased intensity of rainfall particularly events 15 mm day was associated with an increase in runoff but not in soil water content in the few cases where monthly precipitation decreased soil water content also decreased the main impact on all hydrological components of the system appeared to be more significant during the middle of the cropping season may august than at the beginning april or end september these conclusions emerge despite the climate model ensemble underestimating the heaviest daily rainfall events overall this study showed that the projected increasing trend in seasonal rainfall in southern sweden would not result in more soil water being available for crop production keywords climate change agro hydrology runoff water distribution swat modeling 1 introduction the occurrence of global climate change during the past century is now widely accepted by the scientific community and is expected to continue in the future cook et al 2016 among other effects climate change is modifying the pathway of water within the hydrological cycle and the distribution of water in the landscape grusson et al 2018 hartmann et al 2013 held and soden 2006 jiménez cisneros et al 2014 climate change has been shown to impact e g soil water destouni and verrot 2014 verrot and destouni 2016 evapotranspiration mccabe and wolock 2015 and discharge milly et al 2005 roudier et al 2015 these impacts are suggested to be strongly linked to changes in local precipitation and temperature patterns putnam and broecker 2017 stagge et al 2015 vautard et al 2013 when rainwater reaches the soil surface there is an initial partitioning between surface runoff and infiltration any change in the frequency and intensity of rainfall can potentially influence the partitioning between these components a change in the volume of infiltrating water will influence soil moisture content and evapotranspiration rate jung et al 2010 verrot and destouni 2016 the partitioning of rainwater between surface runoff and soil water is a key process from an agronomic perspective because of its direct relationship with available soil water content plant transpiration and biomass production ben gal et al 2003 hanks and rasmussen 1982 hillel and guron 1973 kirkham 2005 shani et al 2007 understanding how the rainfall pattern will change under expected climate change and the impact on hydrological components is crucial for future adaptation of agriculture many studies have investigated the impact of climate change on discharge often considered as water availability e g alfieri et al 2015 koutroulis et al 2018 lobanova et al 2018 substantially fewer studies have examined other hydrological component e g gädeke et al 2017 grusson et al 2018 verrot and destouni 2016 and even fewer have focused specifically on surface runoff infiltration partitioning following changes in precipitation intensity the impact of climate change on nordic agriculture is complex for instance the region could benefit from climate change through an extension of the cropping season and possibilities for growing new crops but negative effects such as new pests and diseases are expected to counterbalance such positive effects maracchi et al 2005 olesen and bindi 2002 olesen et al 2011 peltonen sainio et al 2009 uleberg et al 2014 wiréhn 2018 this fine balance between positive and negative impacts of changes in precipitation pattern needs to be assessed in northern europe as a whole future precipitation is projected to increase on average jacob et al 2014 strandberg et al 2015 this increase could be positive in countries where irrigation is not widely used by farmers e g in sweden cultivation mostly depends on natural rainfall and only 1 7 of agricultural land is irrigated eurostat 2016 however an increase in precipitation at seasonal scale is likely to be combined with an increase in heavy daily rainfall events jacob et al 2014 strandberg et al 2015 and thus much of the additional rainfall may be lost as runoff in addition if more precipitation falls on fewer days during the season the overall increase in seasonal precipitation could be detrimental and cause longer dry periods or excess water in some periods adaptation of nordic agricultural systems appears to be necessary and is actually already ongoing juhola et al 2017 climate adaptation must be designed for local or at most regional level local studies with an agro hydrological focus must therefore be conducted a relatively limited number of studies have investigated the relationship between modifications to water pathways induced by climate change and the impacts on nordic agriculture in a systemic review of nordic agriculture under climate change wiréhn 2018 located only 35 peer reviewed papers most relating climate variables directly to crop yield and plant phenology eckersten et al

impact of rainfall frequency on ago hydrological systems in a rare exception patil et al 2010 investigated the effects of changes in average rainfall volume and number of rainy days on soil water content in a rainfall controlled system of lysimeters they concluded that changes in the total amount of rainfall or in the number of rainy days had no significant impact on maize yield or soil water regime but also pointed out limitations of their experimental design a report in sweden on the impact of more frequent extreme climate events on crop yield found that for the period 1965 2014 most years with low yield were associated with above average dry or wet periods de toro et al 2015 to understand the impact of climate change on the water cycle and the consequences for agriculture it is necessary to i analyze how precipitation will change during the upcoming century and assess the level of confidence in climate projections for the study region and ii investigate the impact of those changes on rainwater partitioning in a novel approach the present study considered both these aspects with the aim of providing an integrated picture of the rainfall soil water runoff nexus and extending the assessment of climate change impacts on swedish agriculture in the first part of the study the climate projections available for sweden were evaluated from an agro hydrological perspective complemented by an analysis of rainfall variations total volume and precipitation intensity patterns for different regions of sweden the second part of the study consisted of hydrological modeling using the soil and water assessment tool swat of possible correlations between changes in precipitation regime and the water distribution at the soil surface the swat model arnold et al 1993 has been widely used around the world in recent decades and has been shown to produce satisfactory results in modeling most components of the hydrological cycle douglas mankin et al 2010 gassman et al 2002 2007 2014 it has been used previously to assess the impact of climate change on the hydrological cycle grusson et al 2018 pascual et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 despite some limitations swat has been shown to provide reasonably good representations of the volume of surface and subsurface runoff ahmadi et al 2019 cheng et al 2016 qi et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 specific objectives of this study were to i perform a comprehensive study including evaluation of available climate datasets projected changes in rainfall intensity and total volume and a swat based impacts assessment on water partitioning and ii assess how projected future increases in total precipitation and changes in precipitation patterns in agricultural regions of sweden might affect the actual water distribution in agricultural areas the latter is critical knowledge when developing adaptation strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change on agriculture e g irrigation planning during the cropping season it was obtained by investigating the relationship between daily and monthly precipitation data and the monthly distribution of water at three sites in southern sweden 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the three sites selected for the study were small agriculture dominated watersheds in southern sweden fig 1 where most swedish agricultural production is concentrated peltonen sainio et al 2015 these watersheds were chosen to represent different agro climatic zones in southern sweden but also the regional differences in projected precipitation this latter is expected to differ slightly between the extreme south of sweden skåne light precipitation increase the south east östergötland moderate precipitation increase and the south west västergötland greater precipitation increase eklund et al 2015 the area of the watersheds ranges from 590 ha östergötland to 931 ha västergötland and all show a relatively low variation in elevation fig 1 as a consequence of this rather limited size and slope of the watersheds the hydrological network investigated consisted largely of artificial agricultural ditches crop production is the dominant land use at the västergötland and skåne sites covering 90 of all land uses in both watersheds at the östergötland site 52 of the watershed is given over to crops values for 2012 but substantial areas are also dedicated to pasture 20 or forest 26 especially in headwater areas the crops grown are mainly cereal wheat barley oats and sugar beet fig 2 soil type differs between the watersheds västergötland is dominated 95 by a deep clay soil clay content 40 in first 20 cm 50 in 20 100 cm layer 60 below 100 cm depth skåne is predominantly 82 covered with relatively shallow soils 60 cm dominated by a sandy texture 45 60 sand östergötland has a more complex and wide soil diversity with about 45 of the surface covered by clay dominated soil 45 75 clay but also with substantial areas of loamy soil 45 70 loam 26 of total watershed area and sandy soil 83 100 sand 26 of total watershed area more details on soil data processing for the model can be found in section 2 2 2 while detailed soil profiles for each watershed are presented in tables s1 s3 in supplementary material sm there are also differences between the sites regards rainfall regime during the cropping season april september fig 3 at the östergötland site precipitation increases during the first two months of the season peaks in july and then decreases for the remainder of the season at the two other sites cropping season precipitation peaks in august and then decreases slowly for the remainder of the season västergötland or stays rather stable skåne as a result of this difference in regime mean annual precipitation 1961 2000 in skåne 685 mm is 15 higher than in östergötland 585 mm and 6 higher than in västergötland 645 mm in terms of temperature the three sites experience similar conditions during the cropping season with daily temperature ranging from 10 c to 20 c 2 2 hydrological simulation 2 2 1 swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat was used in this study to investigate the relationship between changes in precipitation volume rainfall distribution and water distribution within the hydrological system at monthly time steps swat is an agro hydrological semi distributed model based on a first

material at 50 cm depth ii soil profile descriptions from the swedish university of agricultural sciences slu including physical properties of agricultural soils wiklert et al 1983 and iii analytical data on soil characteristics including texture and organic carbon from the swedish national environmental monitoring program the soil map from sgu shows the geographical distribution of parent material in the selected watersheds but contains no information about soil texture or other soil physical parameters each parent material in the soil map was associated to a soil profile and to a set of soil analytical data from the national monitoring program the three sources of information were converted to a raster with 2 m resolution to match the dem brief descriptions of the dominant soil types are given in section 2 1 more details of physical parameters of each profile used as input to the swat model can be found in tables s1 s3 in sm agricultural land use data were obtained by combining regional maps of agricultural land produced by the swedish board of agriculture https nya jordbruksverket se with corresponding tables on crop production spatial land use information for 2012 was used to perform the modeling but the 2000 2012 and 2015 maps were compared to ensure that no major changes had occurred within the watersheds in this period the crop tables give an account of agricultural practices and crops grown in each watershed in different years it was assumed that the most common crop reported by farmers was the dominant land use inside each polygon of the gis map forests urban areas and water bodies were identified from the cadastral plan and orthophotos provided by lantmäteriet following the resolution of the dem a land use raster with resolution 2 m was created by merging the different sources of information the swat default database arnold et al 2012a was used to link land use information from the map to vegetation growth data on a few minor crops grown within the study areas were not available in the model databases so these were classified as closely related crops for instance some low vegetable row crops were classified with ground cover corresponding to strawberries strw the default values in the swat model of heat units needed for each crop to develop and reach maturity were modified to overcome problems linked to day length at northerly latitudes median dates for sowing and harvesting in each watershed were taken from berglund et al 2002 who compiled data from statistics sweden 1987 93 and experiments at slu the grazing season was set as april 1 october 31 based on swedish board of agriculture 2016 in order to simulate forest and forest areas with stable biomass an initial biomass was set for each simulation year thus each simulation year started 1 january with an initial biomass of 100 tonnes per hectare allowed to grow during the summer fertilization regime was kept in automatic mode swat default mode with inputs applied when soil nutrient conditions generated stress and reduced crop development observed weather data for the past 50 years 1970 2018 were taken from the closest weather station to each watershed these stations which were selected from the swedish meteorological and hydrological database smhi www smhi se data were sturup skövde and norrköping1 for skåne västergötland and östergötland respectively daily temperature and precipitation data from those stations were used to calibrate and validate the swat model a projected climate dataset was also obtained from smhi this dataset originated from projections made with an ensemble of global circulation models gcms in the euro cordex project jacob et al 2014 dynamically downscaled on a 5 km grid over scandinavia via the smhi regional climate model rcm rca4 the dataset was then corrected against the smhi re analysis product mesan häggmark et al 2000 using a data based scaling algorithm from smhi yang et al 2010 five gcm rcm pairs were used together with two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 created by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc these scenarios represent possible future radiative forcing in the atmosphere where rcp 4 5 assumes that greenhouse gas emissions are progressively regulated over the coming century to reach stability by 2100 while rcp 8 5 assumes increasing greenhouse gas emissions over time at the current rate detlef et al 2011 moss et al 2010 for each model an historical period starting in 1970 is available to enable comparisons with actual observed data for each site the closest point of the grid to the field was considered only temperature and precipitation data are available in this dataset table 1 presents more details of the projected climate data used in this study the swat model offers several methods for computing evapotranspiration because only precipitation and temperature data were available in the projected climate dataset the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 was selected in this study to simulate evapotranspiration a comparison was made of the hargreaves method and the fao recommended penman monteith method over the reference period 1971 2000 and very strong correlations r2 0 95 between the methods were obtained for all sites see fig s1 in sm data on discharge at the outlet of each catchment were also needed to calibrate the modeling framework data series of mean monthly discharge were obtained from the swedish national environmental monitoring program 2 2 3 calibration and validation identification of sensitive parameters in the swat model and model calibration were performed using swat cup abbaspour 2013 an external tool that allows swat users to perform automatic calibrations using different algorithms arnold et al 2012b in this study we selected the sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2004 because of its ability to identify an appropriate set of parameter values in a limited number of iterations yang et al 2008 calibration through the sufi 2 algorithm aims at identifying values for the defined set of sensitive parameters in order to optimize the values of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 calibration was performed through 1500 runs as recommended by yang et al 2008 calibration and validation were performed at monthly time steps over 10 or 11 year periods the nse is a normalized metric comparing the variance of the observed dataset with the variance of the observation and simulation residual errors the value of nse ranges from to 1 and it is very sensitive to errors in higher values an nse value of 0 indicates that the model is as accurate as the mean of the observations a value higher than 0 5 is considered to indicate satisfactory performance and a value of 1 indicates a perfect fit other metrics used to assess model performance were nse calculated on the root square nsesqrt and on the logarithm of the discharge values nselog nsesqrt reduces the influence of errors in peak values on the metric while nselog reflects the influence of errors in low flow simulations oudin et al 2006 seiller et al 2012 2017 percentage bias pbias which gives information on the deviation in average volume between simulated and observed values was also calculated its value ranges from 0 to with positive values indicating overestimation and negative values indicating underestimation a value of 20 is usually considered an acceptable limit finally coefficient of determination r2 with values ranging from 1 to 1 was computed an r2 value higher than 0 60 was considered satisfactory more details on the criteria values showing goodness of fit in hydrological modeling can be found in moriasi et al 2007 2 3 evaluation of the climate ensemble the available climate dataset for this study was first assessed by comparison against observed dataset for the historical period 1971 2000 this was done by plotting cumulative distribution functions cdfs to compare the different distributions of data over the period two different cdfs were considered for total monthly rainfall and daily rainfall for both a separate analysis was conducted for each month of the cropping season to assess how accurately the local climate was depicted by the climate ensemble at monthly and daily scale 2 4 future rainfall regime from an agricultural perspective the distribution of daily rainfall events is as important as the overall amount of monthly precipitation an analysis was therefore made of changes in the temporal distribution and frequency of monthly and daily rainfall observed data for 1971 2000 were compared against the projected climate in two different future periods of the climate ensemble 2021 2050 and 2051 2080 in a first step the change in total monthly precipitation between past and future periods was investigated the significance of the difference was tested using a wilcoxon rank sum test a non parametric hypothesis test challenging the similarity of two independent distributions it tests the null hypothesis than both distributions are equal against the alternative hypothesis that one distribution is stochastically different from the other mann and whitney 1947 the difference between the distributions is deemed significant at p 0 05 this test was performed with the inbuilt matlab function ranksum in a second step the frequencies of daily rainfall events were calculated for each 1 mm interval and plotted for each month of the cropping season where frequency was defined as the number of events of a class divided by the total number of events to simplify the daily frequency intensity representation the five climate models for each scenario were pooled to a single distribution allowing comparison of the entire climate ensemble for each scenario period against the observations a wilcoxon rank sum test could not be conducted for each of the previously defined 1 mm classes so thresholds of 1 15 and 30 mm were selected to test whether the number of days with rainfall exceeding those thresholds differed significantly in an agro hydrological context daily rainfall of 1 mm can be considered inadequate for agriculture because the water would evaporate before reaching the root zone dastane and fao 1974 however the threshold for efficient rainfall that actually supplies water to crops may differ significantly depending on a large number of parameters e g type of crop temperature crop development stage for this reason thresholds of 15 and 30 mm day chosen from local frequency intensity rainfall characteristics were considered in this study again a pooled distribution of all five models per scenario was used to perform the test 2 5 impact of rainfall changes on surface water distribution the output of the swat model for the three different sites was processed to evaluate changes in partitioning of rainfall between the different pathways runoff infiltration in the local hydrological systems following changes in the rainfall regime at monthly and daily time steps the aim was to identify the impact of changes in the rainfall regime on surface fluxes in the hydrological cycle in this study surface and subsurface runoff from swat output were combined as runoff to characterize the fast pathway in contrast with the slow pathway infiltration groundwater groundwater recharge in a first step runoff as a percentage of total precipitation was compared for past and future periods to evaluate changes in the fraction of surface water quickly flushed out of the watershed over time a histogram was plotted of this fraction of runoff for observed data and for each model period scenario again the periods 2021 2050 and 2051 2080 were compared with the baseline period 1971 2000 in a second step a statistical wilcoxon rank sum test was used to determine the significance of differences in monthly volume of runoff water and in soil water content between the historical period and the two projected periods 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the climate ensemble comparison of the cdfs for the monthly observed data and the data generated by the climate ensemble over the historical period 1971 2000 indicated that the climate ensemble fairly accurately represented local monthly rainfall conditions at the three sites fig 4 however the climate ensemble tended to slightly overestimate the monthly volume of precipitation for the skåne site particularly from may to august similar overestimation was observed for june and july at the västergötland site and for may at östergötland a recurrent bias was observed also for the highest part 90 100 of the distribution where several members of the ensemble seemed to overestimate the monthly precipitation thus the climate ensemble reasonably simulated the volumes of monthly precipitation at the three sites a similar analysis was performed to assess the distribution of daily rainfall events fig 5 the results showed that the climate ensemble provided a good representation of the observed distribution with very few divergences between the different models of the climate ensemble especially for low values of daily rainfall however in this case the very highest part of the distribution of observed daily rainfall events was not described by the climate ensemble distribution for all sites indicating that the climate ensemble underestimated extreme daily rainfall in the present study emphasis was placed on local evaluation of precipitation the spatial homogeneity and the relatively slow temporal variation in temperature in a region of agricultural plains makes it easy to capture by climate models precipitation is a more difficult parameter to spatialize and downscale considering its more local and stochastic nature for this reason temperature is better described by climate models than precipitation as shown for instance in the assessment of the eurocordex ensemble conducted by kotlarski et al 2014 based on that publication and on a report on sweden prepared by eklund et al 2015 using the same dataset as in this study temperature is considered to be depicted satisfactorily by the ensemble and can be expected to rise at all sites during the cropping season eklund et al 2015 3 2 future rainfall regime 3 2 1 monthly precipitation the wilcoxon rank sum tests on total monthly precipitation for each site and each period revealed several significant trends between the observed historical period and the projected period table 2 there was an increase in precipitation volume in may at all three sites especially in scenario rcp 8 5 two of the sites also showed an increasing trend in precipitation volume in june and august in april precipitation volume increased only in scenario rcp 8 5 at the end of the century while in september some scenarios showed a decreasing volume the middle of the cropping season may august appeared to be more strongly impacted by the projected change in monthly precipitation volume 3 2 2 daily rainfall frequencies the rainfall analysis was then scaled down to investigate the changes projected at daily time steps fig 6 shows the frequencies of different daily rainfall intensity classes for each site offering a general view of their distribution for each scenario in the reference period 1971 2000 compared with the projected periods 2021 2050 and 2051 2080 the overall observation was that regardless of site or month days with precipitation 30 mm were more frequent in the projected periods than in the historical period however this difference was only valid up to a certain daily rainfall intensity since the few extreme values of daily rain intensity observed during the historical period were always higher than those produced by the climate models for the future periods the only notable exceptions for which the climate model returned higher extreme values of daily precipitation were for the month of april at skåne and västergötland and the month of july at östergötland an increase in the frequency of the last intensity rainfall class in the projected climate data was also seen in almost all cases this particular trend was not visible within the historical dataset and seems too regular and repetitive to depict a natural pattern the bias correction applied to the climate data aiming to reduce outliers is likely to have affected the highest values of the projected distribution and could explain the lower extreme values and the increase in frequency for the last intensity class simulated by the models the results of wilcoxon rank sum tests on the rainfall frequency intensity findings are summed up in table 3 as it would have been too complicated to carry out a test for each daily rainfall intensity class illustrated in fig 6 a decision was made to focus on the number of days with rainfall volume 1 mm 15 mm and 30 mm as found for the total monthly volume of precipitation table 2 an increasing trend was more apparent during the middle of the cropping season april showed stable values and september showed a decreasing trend this pattern changed when the daily intensity threshold was increased the number of days with precipitation 15 mm increased in april especially at the västergötland site for which all scenarios periods indicated such a trend on the other hand a decreasing trend in september was only detected in one case at västergötland when considering number of days with precipitation 30 mm the differences between sites were more distinct at the skåne site there was an overall increase during the season with the exception of july at the västergötland site the increasing trend during mid season seen for the two previous thresholds was again evident the östergötland site showed a clear decrease in the number of days with 30 mm rainfall in the two first months of the season followed by a clear increase during the rest of the season 3 3 hydrological simulations 3 3 1 swat model performance the performance of the swat models deployed for the three sites is shown in table 4 following the classification of moriasi et al 2007 the nse values obtained showed calibration performance ranging from good at östergötland to very good at västergötland and skåne for validation the nse values decreased slightly but still ranged from acceptable östergötland to very good skåne these values indicate accurate simulation of the hydrological dynamics and peak values by the different swat models the values of nsesqrt ranged from good to very good and the values of r2 were always higher than 0 65 which can also be considered to indicate good model performance the pbias values ranged from very good to satisfactory for östergötland in validation and for västergötland in calibration and supported the evaluation based on nse the scores were lower for nselog indicating that low flow periods were less easily captured by the models especially in östergötland for västergötland the validation was conducted over a two part period because additional discharge data from 96 to 00 became available after the calibration process but the values of the different metrics were not influenced by the use of a split period hydrographs of the calibration and validation periods for each of the three sites revealed that discharge volumes within the three systems were quite low fig 7 this partly explains the limited performance of the model in reproducing low flows nselog as small differences in very small values had a strong impact on the value of the metrics however the models seemed to capture the annual discharge dynamics accurately as they indicated peak flow around january and february and a decrease in water level to a minimum in july or august only one seasonal peak was clearly not captured by the model that at västergötland in january 2011 it is important to note that seasonal peak flow was not included within our study period as our analysis focused on the cropping season april to september corresponding to the decreasing and low flow periods which both seemed to be fairly well simulated by the model fig 7 in order to evaluate the accuracy of the discharge simulations and the likelihood of the hydrological system simulated by the model the monthly volume of each hydrological component in the reference period 1971 2000 was plotted fig 8 the hydrological balance appeared to be reasonable and the graphs revealed several interesting findings on the hydrological functioning of the different watersheds in april the precipitation input barely covered evapotranspiration and soil water content in all three watersheds declined to meet the evapotranspirative demand during the period april may shallow aquifers made a substantial contribution to stream flow but their contribution then declined during the rest of the season this is consistent with the decreasing water level in aquifers during summer and their disconnection from the surface network consisting mainly of shallow ditches the importance of subsurface runoff compared with surface runoff also differed between the watersheds subsurface runoff exceeded surface runoff at östergötland and skåne while at västergötland these two components were relatively well balanced but surface runoff volume was slightly greater this is consistent with the high clay content of the västergötland soil compared with that at the other two sites the distribution of water between surface and subsurface runoff is consistent with the very low slope of the watersheds but also with the presence of agricultural drainage systems these were not explicitly integrated into the modeling framework but were indirectly included by reinforcement of the subsurface water pathway within the modeling environment through calibration of soil physical parameters see tables s4 and s5 in sm 3 4 impact of rainfall changes on surface water distribution following analysis of the rainfall distribution the output from the calibrated swat models was examined for each of the three sites and for the three datasets historical from observed data 1971 2000 and projected from climate models 2021 2050 and 2051 2080 in order to assess how rainfall input was partitioned by the agro hydrological swat model the monthly ratio between water received by the system from precipitation and water flowing out of the system through the fast hydrological path is presented in fig 9 different trends can be seen for the different sites in april there was a marked negative trend in runoff rainfall ratio at the östergötland and västergötland sites the västergötland site had a relatively stable ratio from past to future for the rest of the cropping season with a slight increase during june and august the östergötland site continued to show a decreasing trend during may and then an increase in the ratio during june and july in contrast to both these sites skåne showed an increasing trend in the ratio from the start of the season april that continued during most of the season but was most obvious in may august and september a wilcoxon test was performed on the output of the different calibrated swat models regarding the monthly volume of runoff soil water content and actual evapotranspiration aet for each site period and scenario table 5 as in the previous analysis the results showed a pattern of runoff changes during the cropping season during mid season the runoff volume increased more significantly whereas at the beginning april and end september of the season it was relatively stable skåne or decreasing östergötland no similar pattern in soil water content was observed during the cropping season and this hydrological reservoir seemed to be less impacted by climate change than runoff with less significant trends there was a clear difference in soil water content between the three sites with that at the skåne site remaining quite stable that at västergötland showing a rather uniform decreasing trend in june july and september and that at östergötland decreasing at the beginning and end of the season april and september but with an increase in may the changes in evapotranspirative flux were similar for the skåne and västergötland sites at which aet increased significantly from april to august in all scenarios and periods in september only the rcp 8 5 scenario gave an increase in aet on the other hand the östergötland site showed very few variations in aet with a significant increase only in april and even a decreasing trend in may for the rcp 4 5 scenario with the rest of the cropping season showing quite stable evapotranspiration table 5 3 5 overall impact of future climate on hydrological interactions the variations in all meteorological and hydrological indicators investigated are summarized in table 6 in the wilcoxon tests a trend was reported if at least three cases scenarios periods showed a similar trend table 6 visualizes the links between different components of the hydrological cycle first an increase in the number of days with precipitation 15 or 30 mm seemed to be linked to an increase in total monthly precipitation in all except five cases skåne april and september västergötland april östergötland june and july in only one case the number of days with 30 mm rainfall decreased and the volume of monthly precipitation increased östergötland may second the number of days with 30 mm rainfall seemed to be linked to the runoff rainfall ratio of the 10 cases where the number of days with 30 mm rainfall increased significantly eight were associated with a similar trend in runoff rainfall ratio in several cases the variation in those two components was also associated with an increase in other rainfall indicators including total precipitation e g västergötland june skåne may in other cases the variation in number of days with 30 mm rainfall and in runoff rainfall ratio were the only trends visible skåne april östergötland june or were even in contradiction to other rainfall indicators skåne september östergötland may this reflects the relationship between heavy rainfall events and high runoff third an increase in monthly rainfall was not correlated with an increase in soil water content of the seven cases in which the total volume of monthly precipitation increased only one östergötland may also showed an increase in soil water content in other cases an increase in monthly rainfall was accompanied by a clear increase in several daily rainfall indicators but no change in soil water volume skåne may and august östergötland june and july or even a decreasing trend västergötland june and july on the other hand a decrease in monthly precipitation and days with rainfall 1 mm was linked to a decrease in soil water content västergötland and östergötland september fourth the stable to decreasing trend in soil water content despite increasing precipitation was also related to an increase in aet for two of the three sites skåne and västergötland for the östergötland site the lack of increase in soil water content was not related to an increase in aet except in april when a decreasing amount of soil water and runoff seemed to be associated with increased aet 4 discussion this study investigated the impacts of changes in total monthly rainfall volume and in daily rainfall frequency intensity on agro hydrological systems in three small scale agricultural watersheds in sweden the agro hydrological model swat was set up for the three watersheds this model has been shown to be an efficient tool for simulating hydrological fluxes in the unsaturated zone such as surface and subsurface runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture douglas mankin et al 2010 gassman et al 2002 2007 2014 the partitioning of rainwater reaching the ground is computed by the usda scs curve number cn method scs 1986 modified by williams 1995 this is one of the most widely used methods to compute runoff volume beven 2011 and is known to produce a fair representation of the runoff generated sahu et al 2012 yen et al 2015 it was deemed suitable for our study watersheds where the conditions are close to those for which the scs method was developed small watershed rapid hydrological response dominated by agricultural land situated in a humid to sub humid climate zone beven 2011 in addition during calibration of the swat model cn values are calibrated differently for each hru reducing the area to which a particular value of cn is applied and increasing the efficiency of the method hawkins 2014 hawkins et al 2009 the calibration and validation procedure conducted for each of the three models showed good ability of the models to describe discharge at the watershed outlet with performance criteria mainly indicating good to very good model performance based on moriasi et al 2007 the model deployed at the three sites was calibrated on discharge which in swat is an aggregate of rapid fluxes surface and subsurface runoff and slower fluxes baseflow from the aquifer the balance between these components is a delicate part of the calibration process for hydrological models a known limitation of the swat model is underestimation of surface and subsurface runoff compared with percolation to the aquifer fu et al 2018 however in small watersheds with a shallow hydrological network as simulated here there is a substantial influence of the rapid hydrological response on discharge the calibration of soil parameters is considered to correct this underestimation by increasing the subsurface runoff and by better representing the processes induced by the possible presence of tile drainage within the watershed bringing the model to fit the observed discharge it can thus be assumed that good calibration of discharge is a substantially robust indication of good simulation of rapid fluxes such as surface and subsurface runoff the nse values showing very good results for peak discharge and the nsesqrt and pbias values showing good simulation of average water volume confirmed the good description of surface and subsurface runoff returned by the model specific calibration on runoff would be very complicated considering the complexity of acquiring time series of data for those hydrological components the calibrated models were fed with data from a climate ensemble dataset specifically developed for the scandinavian region but built only from the swedish regional climate model rca4 samuelsson et al 2015 to dynamically downscale the climate data from several global circulation models the rca4 model is known to lie within the wetter part of the distribution of all european regional models from the euro cordex project with a tendency to overestimate seasonal precipitation kotlarski et al 2014 the use of only one rcm meant that epistemic uncertainty linked to this particular model was present through the entire dataset bias correction by the distribution based scaling method yang et al 2010 should have partly corrected this bias the rca4 dataset was locally evaluated in this study regarding both monthly and daily scale comparison over a historical period between observed data and climate ensemble data showed that local climate conditions were fairly well represented by the ensemble for both temporal scales however an overestimation of very wet months was still apparent in our analysis despite the bias correction process in addition comparison of daily rainfall indicated that the ensemble could not fully capture events with very high daily rainfall intensity difficulty in capturing daily extreme events is a known bias in high resolution climate modeling prein et al 2015 and can also be explained by the bias correction process applied to the dataset to reduce the seasonal monthly overestimation of precipitations maraun 2016 the over expression of the last class in the frequency intensity curve presented in fig 6 also tends towards a bias correction issue it should be borne in mind that the correction process was conducted against the mesan re analysis product häggmark et al 2000 and not against the observed data used in this study the ability of the climate ensemble to describe the local climate was nevertheless acceptable comparison with existing bias values from other climate datasets used to conduct hydrological impact studies in the literature is complicated given that such assessments are rarely conducted by environmental researchers at local scale the analysis of projected periods from the climate dataset highlighted several issues an increase in monthly total precipitation was frequently associated with an increase in number of days with high rainfall 15 and 30 mm similar findings were made by klein tank and können 2003 who concluded that a significant part of the recent annual precipitation increase in northern europe is due to very wet days that study was based on observed data 1946 1999 and was thus not impacted by the bias of climate models in failing to depict extreme values bengtsson and rana 2014 compared changes in annual total precipitation and number of days with 20 30 and 40 mm rainfall in southern sweden over a 30 year period and found a significant increase in annual precipitation which they associated with an increase in extreme daily rainfall events but only during winter in another study projecting the rainfall regime to the end of the century with a statistical downscaling method of two gcms chen et al 2015 found that a decreasing number of days with precipitation 0 1 mm was associated with an increase in the average volume of rain per rainy day and the number of days with 25 and 40 mm rainfall those studies all show similar indications for southern sweden with an increase in precipitation associated with an increase in the number of high daily rainfall events however differences in definitions of indicators annual rainfall monthly rainfall months included in seasonal definition wet days and high daily rainfall threshold hinder direct comparison of studies smhi s official definition of an extreme daily rainfall event in sweden 40 mm day is purely meteorological and not particularly relevant in an agricultural context in this study the thresholds of 15 and 30 mm day were mainly chosen based on the frequency intensity diagram fig 6 but are very similar to the thresholds used by chen et al 2015 who regarded 20 mm day as a 2 4 times a year return event and 30 mm day as a yearly return event an increasing trend in high daily rainfall was identified in the present study despite the existing limitation of the climate ensemble in depicting those types of events as shown by figs 4 and 5 and reported in the literature prein et al 2015 this suggests that the increase in heavy rainfall events could potentially be even more significant than reported here from the output of the swat model runoff precipitation ratio was calculated as an indicator of the amount of water flowing out of the watershed through fast routes the increase in precipitation regime observed in this study was found to be more likely to be accompanied by an increase in runoff precipitation ratio than an increase in soil water content thus the greater amount of rainfall water projected for southern sweden will not lead to more water for crops quite the contrary when precipitation total and high daily rainfall and runoff rainfall ratio increased the soil water content decreased in some cases similarly destouni and verrot 2014 used a simple rainfall soil moisture model to simulate moisture conditions in sweden during the 20th century and found an increasing frequency of dry pedological events and no change in frequency of wet pedological events with overall increasing precipitation the observations on soil water content formulated here are important in light of findings that air temperature is also projected to rise overall in southern sweden eklund et al 2015 a clear increasing trend in evapotranspirative flux was found for two of our sites skåne and västergötland most likely influenced by increasing temperature however this is probably not the only explanation since eklund et al 2015 showed that the spring and summer temperature is expected to rise slightly more at östergötland than västergötland one reason for the stability of aet at östergötland could be that overall volume of precipitation was relatively stable at that site but associated with an increase in heavy precipitation 30 mm resulting in a stable or decreasing soil water content the assumption can be made that despite the rise in temperature aet will not increase because of lack of available water in the system for evapotranspiration including soil water this assumption is consistent with findings in the global study conducted by jung et al 2010 and the regional study by destouni and verrot 2014 there are uncertainties associated with any modeling work in this study we attempted to minimize and identify the main uncertainties linked to swat modeling and to the use of data from climate models uncertainties arising from inability of the swat model to precisely describe the internal fluxes of the catchment water cycle were reduced through a careful calibration process and analysis of all hydrological components of the model in climate model projection an ensemble of several climate models was used to reduce the uncertainty linked to individual models 5 conclusions this study investigated the relationship between rainfall indicators and monthly water distribution within the hydrological systems of three agricultural watersheds in sweden using regionalized bias corrected climate datasets to feed the agro hydrological model swat the rainfall data from the climate ensemble were first analyzed in terms of total monthly precipitation and frequency of daily rainfall and then the effects on surface and subsurface hydrological fluxes and actual evapotranspiration were examined the climate model ensemble used was found to overestimate total precipitation in very wet months but at the same time had difficulty representing extreme daily rainfall events this could affect simulations of the impact on agricultural systems where water management is a daily to multi day process rather than a monthly or seasonal process despite those limitations the simulated rainfall amount during the cropping season increased at all three study sites in all months except september when it decreased at two sites an increase in total monthly precipitation was generally associated with an increase in high daily rainfall events particularly events 15 mm day it was also associated with an increase in runoff rainfall ratio simulated by the swat model but not in soil water content evapotranspirative flux was found to increase but only at two of the three sites indicating that more complex processes than a rise in temperature and aet explain the stable trend recorded for soil water content in combination the increase in runoff due to heavy rainfall events and the increase in evapotranspiration due to temperature rise may mainly explain the lack of significant increase in soil water content despite the increase in overall precipitation volume thus the present study showed that an increase in future precipitation in sweden will not lead to an increase in soil water content for two main reasons i the increase in precipitation is likely to be associated with an increase in heavy precipitation events that tend to produce more runoff than soil infiltration and ii the increase in temperature will increase evapotranspiration which will deplete soil water reserves the study could be used as a framework for similar investigations in other regions or countries it demonstrates the importance of not only considering the average change in precipitation but also the importance in agro hydrological terms of considering local changes including changes in precipitation frequencies declaration of competing

such changes in three small swedish watersheds dominated by agricultural land the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to investigate the relationship between changes in precipitation monthly and daily and monthly water partitioning between runoff soil water content and evapotranspiration a climate ensemble produced from representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios 4 5 and 8 5 and five different global climate models regionalized by the swedish regional climate model rca4 was used to feed the swat model the results showed similar outcomes for the three sites with an increase in total monthly precipitation often associated with an increase in high daily rainfall events increased intensity of rainfall particularly events 15 mm day was associated with an increase in runoff but not in soil water content in the few cases where monthly precipitation decreased soil water content also decreased the main impact on all hydrological components of the system appeared to be more significant during the middle of the cropping season may august than at the beginning april or end september these conclusions emerge despite the climate model ensemble underestimating the heaviest daily rainfall events overall this study showed that the projected increasing trend in seasonal rainfall in southern sweden would not result in more soil water being available for crop production keywords climate change agro hydrology runoff water distribution swat modeling 1 introduction the occurrence of global climate change during the past century is now widely accepted by the scientific community and is expected to continue in the future cook et al 2016 among other effects climate change is modifying the pathway of water within the hydrological cycle and the distribution of water in the landscape grusson et al 2018 hartmann et al 2013 held and soden 2006 jiménez cisneros et al 2014 climate change has been shown to impact e g soil water destouni and verrot 2014 verrot and destouni 2016 evapotranspiration mccabe and wolock 2015 and discharge milly et al 2005 roudier et al 2015 these impacts are suggested to be strongly linked to changes in local precipitation and temperature patterns putnam and broecker 2017 stagge et al 2015 vautard et al 2013 when rainwater reaches the soil surface there is an initial partitioning between surface runoff and infiltration any change in the frequency and intensity of rainfall can potentially influence the partitioning between these components a change in the volume of infiltrating water will influence soil moisture content and evapotranspiration rate jung et al 2010 verrot and destouni 2016 the partitioning of rainwater between surface runoff and soil water is a key process from an agronomic perspective because of its direct relationship with available soil water content plant transpiration and biomass production ben gal et al 2003 hanks and rasmussen 1982 hillel and guron 1973 kirkham 2005 shani et al 2007 understanding how the rainfall pattern will change under expected climate change and the impact on hydrological components is crucial for future adaptation of agriculture many studies have investigated the impact of climate change on discharge often considered as water availability e g alfieri et al 2015 koutroulis et al 2018 lobanova et al 2018 substantially fewer studies have examined other hydrological component e g gädeke et al 2017 grusson et al 2018 verrot and destouni 2016 and even fewer have focused specifically on surface runoff infiltration partitioning following changes in precipitation intensity the impact of climate change on nordic agriculture is complex for instance the region could benefit from climate change through an extension of the cropping season and possibilities for growing new crops but negative effects such as new pests and diseases are expected to counterbalance such positive effects maracchi et al 2005 olesen and bindi 2002 olesen et al 2011 peltonen sainio et al 2009 uleberg et al 2014 wiréhn 2018 this fine balance between positive and negative impacts of changes in precipitation pattern needs to be assessed in northern europe as a whole future precipitation is projected to increase on average jacob et al 2014 strandberg et al 2015 this increase could be positive in countries where irrigation is not widely used by farmers e g in sweden cultivation mostly depends on natural rainfall and only 1 7 of agricultural land is irrigated eurostat 2016 however an increase in precipitation at seasonal scale is likely to be combined with an increase in heavy daily rainfall events jacob et al 2014 strandberg et al 2015 and thus much of the additional rainfall may be lost as runoff in addition if more precipitation falls on fewer days during the season the overall increase in seasonal precipitation could be detrimental and cause longer dry periods or excess water in some periods adaptation of nordic agricultural systems appears to be necessary and is actually already ongoing juhola et al 2017 climate adaptation must be designed for local or at most regional level local studies with an agro hydrological focus must therefore be conducted a relatively limited number of studies have investigated the relationship between modifications to water pathways induced by climate change and the impacts on nordic agriculture in a systemic review of nordic agriculture under climate change wiréhn 2018 located only 35 peer reviewed papers most relating climate variables directly to crop yield and plant phenology eckersten et al 2012 kristensen et al 2011 olesen 2005 ozturk et al 2017 pulatov et al 2015 or to system vulnerability juhola et al 2017 kvalvik et al 2011 without studying the rainfall soil water relationship or the impact of rainfall frequency on ago hydrological systems in a rare exception patil et al 2010 investigated the effects of changes in average rainfall volume and number of rainy days on soil water content in a rainfall controlled system of lysimeters they concluded that changes in the total amount of rainfall or in the number of rainy days had no significant impact on maize yield or soil water regime but also pointed out limitations of their experimental design a report in sweden on the impact of more frequent extreme climate events on crop yield found that for the period 1965 2014 most years with low yield were associated with above average dry or wet periods de toro et al 2015 to understand the impact of climate change on the water cycle and the consequences for agriculture it is necessary to i analyze how precipitation will change during the upcoming century and assess the level of confidence in climate projections for the study region and ii investigate the impact of those changes on rainwater partitioning in a novel approach the present study considered both these aspects with the aim of providing an integrated picture of the rainfall soil water runoff nexus and extending the assessment of climate change impacts on swedish agriculture in the first part of the study the climate projections available for sweden were evaluated from an agro hydrological perspective complemented by an analysis of rainfall variations total volume and precipitation intensity patterns for different regions of sweden the second part of the study consisted of hydrological modeling using the soil and water assessment tool swat of possible correlations between changes in precipitation regime and the water distribution at the soil surface the swat model arnold et al 1993 has been widely used around the world in recent decades and has been shown to produce satisfactory results in modeling most components of the hydrological cycle douglas mankin et al 2010 gassman et al 2002 2007 2014 it has been used previously to assess the impact of climate change on the hydrological cycle grusson et al 2018 pascual et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 despite some limitations swat has been shown to provide reasonably good representations of the volume of surface and subsurface runoff ahmadi et al 2019 cheng et al 2016 qi et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 specific objectives of this study were to i perform a comprehensive study including evaluation of available climate datasets projected changes in rainfall intensity and total volume and a swat based impacts assessment on water partitioning and ii assess how projected future increases in total precipitation and changes in precipitation patterns in agricultural regions of sweden might affect the actual water distribution in agricultural areas the latter is critical knowledge when developing adaptation strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change on agriculture e g irrigation planning during the cropping season it was obtained by investigating the relationship between daily and monthly precipitation data and the monthly distribution of water at three sites in southern sweden 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the three sites selected for the study were small agriculture dominated watersheds in southern sweden fig 1 where most swedish agricultural production is concentrated peltonen sainio et al 2015 these watersheds were chosen to represent different agro climatic zones in southern sweden but also the regional differences in projected precipitation this latter is expected to differ slightly between the extreme south of sweden skåne light precipitation increase the south east östergötland moderate precipitation increase and the south west västergötland greater precipitation increase eklund et al 2015 the area of the watersheds ranges from 590 ha östergötland to 931 ha västergötland and all show a relatively low variation in elevation fig 1 as a consequence of this rather limited size and slope of the watersheds the hydrological network investigated consisted largely of artificial agricultural ditches crop production is the dominant land use at the västergötland and skåne sites covering 90 of all land uses in both watersheds at the östergötland site 52 of the watershed is given over to crops values for 2012 but substantial areas are also dedicated to pasture 20 or forest 26 especially in headwater areas the crops grown are mainly cereal wheat barley oats and sugar beet fig 2 soil type differs between the watersheds västergötland is dominated 95 by a deep clay soil clay content 40 in first 20 cm 50 in 20 100 cm layer 60 below 100 cm depth skåne is predominantly 82 covered with relatively shallow soils 60 cm dominated by a sandy texture 45 60 sand östergötland has a more complex and wide soil diversity with about 45 of the surface covered by clay dominated soil 45 75 clay but also with substantial areas of loamy soil 45 70 loam 26 of total watershed area and sandy soil 83 100 sand 26 of total watershed area more details on soil data processing for the model can be found in section 2 2 2 while detailed soil profiles for each watershed are presented in tables s1 s3 in supplementary material sm there are also differences between the sites regards rainfall regime during the cropping season april september fig 3 at the östergötland site precipitation increases during the first two months of the season peaks in july and then decreases for the remainder of the season at the two other sites cropping season precipitation peaks in august and then decreases slowly for the remainder of the season västergötland or stays rather stable skåne as a result of this difference in regime mean annual precipitation 1961 2000 in skåne 685 mm is 15 higher than in östergötland 585 mm and 6 higher than in västergötland 645 mm in terms of temperature the three sites experience similar conditions during the cropping season with daily temperature ranging from 10 c to 20 c 2 2 hydrological simulation 2 2 1 swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat was used in this study to investigate the relationship between changes in precipitation volume rainfall distribution and water distribution within the hydrological system at monthly time steps swat is an agro hydrological semi distributed model based on a first discretization of landscape according to stream network and topography arnold et al 1993 this information is used to divide the watershed into sub watersheds arnold et al 1993 1998 neitsch et al 2011 hydrological response units hrus i e homogeneous areas of soil land cover and slope are then identified within each sub watershed water balance is computed within each hru articulated around four compartments snow soil shallow aquifer deep aquifer linked by hydrological processes such as infiltration surface runoff subsurface runoff evapotranspiration and percolation more details about the processes modeled by swat can be found in the theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 computation is performed at hru level aggregated at sub watershed level and routed from upstream to the final outlet a gis based graphical interface helps users define hrus and generate associated input files here we used arcswat 2012 olivera et al 2006 2 2 2 input data for swat and model set up the selected sites are part of the swedish national environmental monitoring program naturväårdsverket slu www slu se en environment and are therefore well documented with substantial amounts of relevant data available the topographical map presented in fig 1 originated from a 2 m resolution digital elevation model dem provided by the swedish mapping cadastral and land registration authority lantmäteriet www lantmateriet se several sources were combined to describe the soils in each watershed these were i soil maps from the swedish geological institute sgu www sgu se including dominant soil parent material at 50 cm depth ii soil profile descriptions from the swedish university of agricultural sciences slu including physical properties of agricultural soils wiklert et al 1983 and iii analytical data on soil characteristics including texture and organic carbon from the swedish national environmental monitoring program the soil map from sgu shows the geographical distribution of parent material in the selected watersheds but contains no information about soil texture or other soil physical parameters each parent material in the soil map was associated to a soil profile and to a set of soil analytical data from the national monitoring program the three sources of information were converted to a raster with 2 m resolution to match the dem brief descriptions of the dominant soil types are given in section 2 1 more details of physical parameters of each profile used as input to the swat model can be found in tables s1 s3 in sm agricultural land use data were obtained by combining regional maps of agricultural land produced by the swedish board of agriculture https nya jordbruksverket se with corresponding tables on crop production spatial land use information for 2012 was used to perform the modeling but the 2000 2012 and 2015 maps were compared to ensure that no major changes had occurred within the watersheds in this period the crop tables give an account of agricultural practices and crops grown in each watershed in different years it was assumed that the most common crop reported by farmers was the dominant land use inside each polygon of the gis map forests urban areas and water bodies were identified from the cadastral plan and orthophotos provided by lantmäteriet following the resolution of the dem a land use raster with resolution 2 m was created by merging the different sources of information the swat default database arnold et al 2012a was used to link land use information from the map to vegetation growth data on a few minor crops grown within the study areas were not available in the model databases so these were classified as closely related crops for instance some low vegetable row crops were classified with ground cover corresponding to strawberries strw the default values in the swat model of heat units needed for each crop to develop and reach maturity were modified to overcome problems linked to day length at northerly latitudes median dates for sowing and harvesting in each watershed were taken from berglund et al 2002 who compiled data from statistics sweden 1987 93 and experiments at slu the grazing season was set as april 1 october 31 based on swedish board of agriculture 2016 in order to simulate forest and forest areas with stable biomass an initial biomass was set for each simulation year thus each simulation year started 1 january with an initial biomass of 100 tonnes per hectare allowed to grow during the summer fertilization regime was kept in automatic mode swat default mode with inputs applied when soil nutrient conditions generated stress and reduced crop development observed weather data for the past 50 years 1970 2018 were taken from the closest weather station to each watershed these stations which were selected from the swedish meteorological and hydrological database smhi www smhi se data were sturup skövde and norrköping1 for skåne västergötland and östergötland respectively daily temperature and precipitation data from those stations were used to calibrate and validate the swat model a projected climate dataset was also obtained from smhi this dataset originated from projections made with an ensemble of global circulation models gcms in the euro cordex project jacob et al 2014 dynamically downscaled on a 5 km grid over scandinavia via the smhi regional climate model rcm rca4 the dataset was then corrected against the smhi re analysis product mesan häggmark et al 2000 using a data based scaling algorithm from smhi yang et al 2010 five gcm rcm pairs were used together with two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 created by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc these scenarios represent possible future radiative forcing in the atmosphere where rcp 4 5 assumes that greenhouse gas emissions are progressively regulated over the coming century to reach stability by 2100 while rcp 8 5 assumes increasing greenhouse gas emissions over time at the current rate detlef et al 2011 moss et al 2010 for each model an historical period starting in 1970 is available to enable comparisons with actual observed data for each site the closest point of the grid to the field was considered only temperature and precipitation data are available in this dataset table 1 presents more details of the projected climate data used in this study the swat model offers several methods for computing evapotranspiration because only precipitation and temperature data were available in the projected climate dataset the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 was selected in this study to simulate evapotranspiration a comparison was made of the hargreaves method and the fao recommended penman monteith method over the reference period 1971 2000 and very strong correlations r2 0 95 between the methods were obtained for all sites see fig s1 in sm data on discharge at the outlet of each catchment were also needed to calibrate the modeling framework data series of mean monthly discharge were obtained from the swedish national environmental monitoring program 2 2 3 calibration and validation identification of sensitive parameters in the swat model and model calibration were performed using swat cup abbaspour 2013 an external tool that allows swat users to perform automatic calibrations using different algorithms arnold et al 2012b in this study we selected the sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2004 because of its ability to identify an appropriate set of parameter values in a limited number of iterations yang et al 2008 calibration through the sufi 2 algorithm aims at identifying values for the defined set of sensitive parameters in order to optimize the values of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 calibration was performed through 1500 runs as recommended by yang et al 2008 calibration and validation were performed at monthly time steps over 10 or 11 year periods the nse is a normalized metric comparing the variance of the observed dataset with the variance of the observation and simulation residual errors the value of nse ranges from to 1 and it is very sensitive to errors in higher values an nse value of 0 indicates that the model is as accurate as the mean of the observations a value higher than 0 5 is considered to indicate satisfactory performance and a value of 1 indicates a perfect fit other metrics used to assess model performance were nse calculated on the root square nsesqrt and on the logarithm of the discharge values nselog nsesqrt reduces the influence of errors in peak values on the metric while nselog reflects the influence of errors in low flow simulations oudin et al 2006 seiller et al 2012 2017 percentage bias pbias which gives information on the deviation in average volume between simulated and observed values was also calculated its value ranges from 0 to with positive values indicating overestimation and negative values indicating underestimation a value of 20 is usually considered an acceptable limit finally coefficient of determination r2 with values ranging from 1 to 1 was computed an r2 value higher than 0 60 was considered satisfactory more details on the criteria values showing goodness of fit in hydrological modeling can be found in moriasi et al 2007 2 3 evaluation of the climate ensemble the available climate dataset for this study was first assessed by comparison against observed dataset for the historical period 1971 2000 this was done by plotting cumulative distribution functions cdfs to compare the different distributions of data over the period two different cdfs were considered for total monthly rainfall and daily rainfall for both a separate analysis was conducted for each month of the cropping season to assess how accurately the local climate was depicted by the climate ensemble at monthly and daily scale 2 4 future rainfall regime from an agricultural perspective the distribution of daily rainfall events is as important as the overall amount of monthly precipitation an analysis was therefore made of changes in the temporal distribution and frequency of monthly and daily rainfall observed data for 1971 2000 were compared against the projected climate in two different future periods of the climate ensemble 2021 2050 and 2051 2080 in a first step the change in total monthly precipitation between past and future periods was investigated the significance of the difference was tested using a wilcoxon rank sum test a non parametric hypothesis test challenging the similarity of two independent distributions it tests the null hypothesis than both distributions are equal against the alternative hypothesis that one distribution is stochastically different from the other mann and whitney 1947 the difference between the distributions is deemed significant at p 0 05 this test was performed with the inbuilt matlab function ranksum in a second step the frequencies of daily rainfall events were calculated for each 1 mm interval and plotted for each month of the cropping season where frequency was defined as the number of events of a class divided by the total number of events to simplify the daily frequency intensity representation the five climate models for each scenario were pooled to a single distribution allowing comparison of the entire climate ensemble for each scenario period against the observations a wilcoxon rank sum test could not be conducted for each of the previously defined 1 mm classes so thresholds of 1 15 and 30 mm were selected to test whether the number of days with rainfall exceeding those thresholds differed significantly in an agro hydrological context daily rainfall of 1 mm can be considered inadequate for agriculture because the water would evaporate before reaching the root zone dastane and fao 1974 however the threshold for efficient rainfall that actually supplies water to crops may differ significantly depending on a large number of parameters e g type of crop temperature crop development stage for this reason thresholds of 15 and 30 mm day chosen from local frequency intensity rainfall characteristics were considered in this study again a pooled distribution of all five models per scenario was used to perform the test 2 5 impact of rainfall changes on surface water distribution the output of the swat model for the three different sites was processed to evaluate changes in partitioning of rainfall between the different pathways runoff infiltration in the local hydrological systems following changes in the rainfall regime at monthly and daily time steps the aim was to identify the impact of changes in the rainfall regime on surface fluxes in the hydrological cycle in this study surface and subsurface runoff from swat output were combined as runoff to characterize the fast pathway in contrast with the slow pathway infiltration groundwater groundwater recharge in a first step runoff as a percentage of total precipitation was compared for past and future periods to evaluate changes in the fraction of surface water quickly flushed out of the watershed over time a histogram was plotted of this fraction of runoff for observed data and for each model period scenario again the periods 2021 2050 and 2051 2080 were compared with the baseline period 1971 2000 in a second step a statistical wilcoxon rank sum test was used to determine the significance of differences in monthly volume of runoff water and in soil water content between the historical period and the two projected periods 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the climate ensemble comparison of the cdfs for the monthly observed data and the data generated by the climate ensemble over the historical period 1971 2000 indicated that the climate ensemble fairly accurately represented local monthly rainfall conditions at the three sites fig 4 however the climate ensemble tended to slightly overestimate the monthly volume of precipitation for the skåne site particularly from may to august similar overestimation was observed for june and july at the västergötland site and for may at östergötland a recurrent bias was observed also for the highest part 90 100 of the distribution where several members of the ensemble seemed to overestimate the monthly precipitation thus the climate ensemble reasonably simulated the volumes of monthly precipitation at the three sites a similar analysis was performed to assess the distribution of daily rainfall events fig 5 the results showed that the climate ensemble provided a good representation of the observed distribution with very few divergences between the different models of the climate ensemble especially for low values of daily rainfall however in this case the very highest part of the distribution of observed daily rainfall events was not described by the climate ensemble distribution for all sites indicating that the climate ensemble underestimated extreme daily rainfall in the present study emphasis was placed on local evaluation of precipitation the spatial homogeneity and the relatively slow temporal variation in temperature in a region of agricultural plains makes it easy to capture by climate models precipitation is a more difficult parameter to spatialize and downscale considering its more local and stochastic nature for this reason temperature is better described by climate models than precipitation as shown for instance in the assessment of the eurocordex ensemble conducted by kotlarski et al 2014 based on that publication and on a report on sweden prepared by eklund et al 2015 using the same dataset as in this study temperature is considered to be depicted satisfactorily by the ensemble and can be expected to rise at all sites during the cropping season eklund et al 2015 3 2 future rainfall regime 3 2 1 monthly precipitation the wilcoxon rank sum tests on total monthly precipitation for each site and each period revealed several significant trends between the observed historical period and the projected period table 2 there was an increase in precipitation volume in may at all three sites especially in scenario rcp 8 5 two of the sites also showed an increasing trend in precipitation volume in june and august in april precipitation volume increased only in scenario rcp 8 5 at the end of the century while in september some scenarios showed a decreasing volume the middle of the cropping season may august appeared to be more strongly impacted by the projected change in monthly precipitation volume 3 2 2 daily rainfall frequencies the rainfall analysis was then scaled down to investigate the changes projected at daily time steps fig 6 shows the frequencies of different daily rainfall intensity classes for each site offering a general view of their distribution for each scenario in the reference period 1971 2000 compared with the projected periods 2021 2050 and 2051 2080 the overall observation was that regardless of site or month days with precipitation 30 mm were more frequent in the projected periods than in the historical period however this difference was only valid up to a certain daily rainfall intensity since the few extreme values of daily rain intensity observed during the historical period were always higher than those produced by the climate models for the future periods the only notable exceptions for which the climate model returned higher extreme values of daily precipitation were for the month of april at skåne and västergötland and the month of july at östergötland an increase in the frequency of the last intensity rainfall class in the projected climate data was also seen in almost all cases this particular trend was not visible within the historical dataset and seems too regular and repetitive to depict a natural pattern the bias correction applied to the climate data aiming to reduce outliers is likely to have affected the highest values of the projected distribution and could explain the lower extreme values and the increase in frequency for the last intensity class simulated by the models the results of wilcoxon rank sum tests on the rainfall frequency intensity findings are summed up in table 3 as it would have been too complicated to carry out a test for each daily rainfall intensity class illustrated in fig 6 a decision was made to focus on the number of days with rainfall volume 1 mm 15 mm and 30 mm as found for the total monthly volume of precipitation table 2 an increasing trend was more apparent during the middle of the cropping season april showed stable values and september showed a decreasing trend this pattern changed when the daily intensity threshold was increased the number of days with precipitation 15 mm increased in april especially at the västergötland site for which all scenarios periods indicated such a trend on the other hand a decreasing trend in september was only detected in one case at västergötland when considering number of days with precipitation 30 mm the differences between sites were more distinct at the skåne site there was an overall increase during the season with the exception of july at the västergötland site the increasing trend during mid season seen for the two previous thresholds was again evident the östergötland site showed a clear decrease in the number of days with 30 mm rainfall in the two first months of the season followed by a clear increase during the rest of the season 3 3 hydrological simulations 3 3 1 swat model performance the performance of the swat models deployed for the three sites is shown in table 4 following the classification of moriasi et al 2007 the nse values obtained showed calibration performance ranging from good at östergötland to very good at västergötland and skåne for validation the nse values decreased slightly but still ranged from acceptable östergötland to very good skåne these values indicate accurate simulation of the hydrological dynamics and peak values by the different swat models the values of nsesqrt ranged from good to very good and the values of r2 were always higher than 0 65 which can also be considered to indicate good model performance the pbias values ranged from very good to satisfactory for östergötland in validation and for västergötland in calibration and supported the evaluation based on nse the scores were lower for nselog indicating that low flow periods were less easily captured by the models especially in östergötland for västergötland the validation was conducted over a two part period because additional discharge data from 96 to 00 became available after the calibration process but the values of the different metrics were not influenced by the use of a split period hydrographs of the calibration and validation periods for each of the three sites revealed that discharge volumes within the three systems were quite low fig 7 this partly explains the limited performance of the model in reproducing low flows nselog as small differences in very small values had a strong impact on the value of the metrics however the models seemed to capture the annual discharge dynamics accurately as they indicated peak flow around january and february and a decrease in water level to a minimum in july or august only one seasonal peak was clearly not captured by the model that at västergötland in january 2011 it is important to note that seasonal peak flow was not included within our study period as our analysis focused on the cropping season april to september corresponding to the decreasing and low flow periods which both seemed to be fairly well simulated by the model fig 7 in order to evaluate the accuracy of the discharge simulations and the likelihood of the hydrological system simulated by the model the monthly volume of each hydrological component in the reference period 1971 2000 was plotted fig 8 the hydrological balance appeared to be reasonable and the graphs revealed several interesting findings on the hydrological functioning of the different watersheds in april the precipitation input barely covered evapotranspiration and soil water content in all three watersheds declined to meet the evapotranspirative demand during the period april may shallow aquifers made a substantial contribution to stream flow but their contribution then declined during the rest of the season this is consistent with the decreasing water level in aquifers during summer and their disconnection from the surface network consisting mainly of shallow ditches the importance of subsurface runoff compared with surface runoff also differed between the watersheds subsurface runoff exceeded surface runoff at östergötland and skåne while at västergötland these two components were relatively well balanced but surface runoff volume was slightly greater this is consistent with the high clay content of the västergötland soil compared with that at the other two sites the distribution of water between surface and subsurface runoff is consistent with the very low slope of the watersheds but also with the presence of agricultural drainage systems these were not explicitly integrated into the modeling framework but were indirectly included by reinforcement of the subsurface water pathway within the modeling environment through calibration of soil physical parameters see tables s4 and s5 in sm 3 4 impact of rainfall changes on surface water distribution following analysis of the rainfall distribution the output from the calibrated swat models was examined for each of the three sites and for the three datasets historical from observed data 1971 2000 and projected from climate models 2021 2050 and 2051 2080 in order to assess how rainfall input was partitioned by the agro hydrological swat model the monthly ratio between water received by the system from precipitation and water flowing out of the system through the fast hydrological path is presented in fig 9 different trends can be seen for the different sites in april there was a marked negative trend in runoff rainfall ratio at the östergötland and västergötland sites the västergötland site had a relatively stable ratio from past to future for the rest of the cropping season with a slight increase during june and august the östergötland site continued to show a decreasing trend during may and then an increase in the ratio during june and july in contrast to both these sites skåne showed an increasing trend in the ratio from the start of the season april that continued during most of the season but was most obvious in may august and september a wilcoxon test was performed on the output of the different calibrated swat models regarding the monthly volume of runoff soil water content and actual evapotranspiration aet for each site period and scenario table 5 as in the previous analysis the results showed a pattern of runoff changes during the cropping season during mid season the runoff volume increased more significantly whereas at the beginning april and end september of the season it was relatively stable skåne or decreasing östergötland no similar pattern in soil water content was observed during the cropping season and this hydrological reservoir seemed to be less impacted by climate change than runoff with less significant trends there was a clear difference in soil water content between the three sites with that at the skåne site remaining quite stable that at västergötland showing a rather uniform decreasing trend in june july and september and that at östergötland decreasing at the beginning and end of the season april and september but with an increase in may the changes in evapotranspirative flux were similar for the skåne and västergötland sites at which aet increased significantly from april to august in all scenarios and periods in september only the rcp 8 5 scenario gave an increase in aet on the other hand the östergötland site showed very few variations in aet with a significant increase only in april and even a decreasing trend in may for the rcp 4 5 scenario with the rest of the cropping season showing quite stable evapotranspiration table 5 3 5 overall impact of future climate on hydrological interactions the variations in all meteorological and hydrological indicators investigated are summarized in table 6 in the wilcoxon tests a trend was reported if at least three cases scenarios periods showed a similar trend table 6 visualizes the links between different components of the hydrological cycle first an increase in the number of days with precipitation 15 or 30 mm seemed to be linked to an increase in total monthly precipitation in all except five cases skåne april and september västergötland april östergötland june and july in only one case the number of days with 30 mm rainfall decreased and the volume of monthly precipitation increased östergötland may second the number of days with 30 mm rainfall seemed to be linked to the runoff rainfall ratio of the 10 cases where the number of days with 30 mm rainfall increased significantly eight were associated with a similar trend in runoff rainfall ratio in several cases the variation in those two components was also associated with an increase in other rainfall indicators including total precipitation e g västergötland june skåne may in other cases the variation in number of days with 30 mm rainfall and in runoff rainfall ratio were the only trends visible skåne april östergötland june or were even in contradiction to other rainfall indicators skåne september östergötland may this reflects the relationship between heavy rainfall events and high runoff third an increase in monthly rainfall was not correlated with an increase in soil water content of the seven cases in which the total volume of monthly precipitation increased only one östergötland may also showed an increase in soil water content in other cases an increase in monthly rainfall was accompanied by a clear increase in several daily rainfall indicators but no change in soil water volume skåne may and august östergötland june and july or even a decreasing trend västergötland june and july on the other hand a decrease in monthly precipitation and days with rainfall 1 mm was linked to a decrease in soil water content västergötland and östergötland september fourth the stable to decreasing trend in soil water content despite increasing precipitation was also related to an increase in aet for two of the three sites skåne and västergötland for the östergötland site the lack of increase in soil water content was not related to an increase in aet except in april when a decreasing amount of soil water and runoff seemed to be associated with increased aet 4 discussion this study investigated the impacts of changes in total monthly rainfall volume and in daily rainfall frequency intensity on agro hydrological systems in three small scale agricultural watersheds in sweden the agro hydrological model swat was set up for the three watersheds this model has been shown to be an efficient tool for simulating hydrological fluxes in the unsaturated zone such as surface and subsurface runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture douglas mankin et al 2010 gassman et al 2002 2007 2014 the partitioning of rainwater reaching the ground is computed by the usda scs curve number cn method scs 1986 modified by williams 1995 this is one of the most widely used methods to compute runoff volume beven 2011 and is known to produce a fair representation of the runoff generated sahu et al 2012 yen et al 2015 it was deemed suitable for our study watersheds where the conditions are close to those for which the scs method was developed small watershed rapid hydrological response dominated by agricultural land situated in a humid to sub humid climate zone beven 2011 in addition during calibration of the swat model cn values are calibrated differently for each hru reducing the area to which a particular value of cn is applied and increasing the efficiency of the method hawkins 2014 hawkins et al 2009 the calibration and validation procedure conducted for each of the three models showed good ability of the models to describe discharge at the watershed outlet with performance criteria mainly indicating good to very good model performance based on moriasi et al 2007 the model deployed at the three sites was calibrated on discharge which in swat is an aggregate of rapid fluxes surface and subsurface runoff and slower fluxes baseflow from the aquifer the balance between these components is a delicate part of the calibration process for hydrological models a known limitation of the swat model is underestimation of surface and subsurface runoff compared with percolation to the aquifer fu et al 2018 however in small watersheds with a shallow hydrological network as simulated here there is a substantial influence of the rapid hydrological response on discharge the calibration of soil parameters is considered to correct this underestimation by increasing the subsurface runoff and by better representing the processes induced by the possible presence of tile drainage within the watershed bringing the model to fit the observed discharge it can thus be assumed that good calibration of discharge is a substantially robust indication of good simulation of rapid fluxes such as surface and subsurface runoff the nse values showing very good results for peak discharge and the nsesqrt and pbias values showing good simulation of average water volume confirmed the good description of surface and subsurface runoff returned by the model specific calibration on runoff would be very complicated considering the complexity of acquiring time series of data for those hydrological components the calibrated models were fed with data from a climate ensemble dataset specifically developed for the scandinavian region but built only from the swedish regional climate model rca4 samuelsson et al 2015 to dynamically downscale the climate data from several global circulation models the rca4 model is known to lie within the wetter part of the distribution of all european regional models from the euro cordex project with a tendency to overestimate seasonal precipitation kotlarski et al 2014 the use of only one rcm meant that epistemic uncertainty linked to this particular model was present through the entire dataset bias correction by the distribution based scaling method yang et al 2010 should have partly corrected this bias the rca4 dataset was locally evaluated in this study regarding both monthly and daily scale comparison over a historical period between observed data and climate ensemble data showed that local climate conditions were fairly well represented by the ensemble for both temporal scales however an overestimation of very wet months was still apparent in our analysis despite the bias correction process in addition comparison of daily rainfall indicated that the ensemble could not fully capture events with very high daily rainfall intensity difficulty in capturing daily extreme events is a known bias in high resolution climate modeling prein et al 2015 and can also be explained by the bias correction process applied to the dataset to reduce the seasonal monthly overestimation of precipitations maraun 2016 the over expression of the last class in the frequency intensity curve presented in fig 6 also tends towards a bias correction issue it should be borne in mind that the correction process was conducted against the mesan re analysis product häggmark et al 2000 and not against the observed data used in this study the ability of the climate ensemble to describe the local climate was nevertheless acceptable comparison with existing bias values from other climate datasets used to conduct hydrological impact studies in the literature is complicated given that such assessments are rarely conducted by environmental researchers at local scale the analysis of projected periods from the climate dataset highlighted several issues an increase in monthly total precipitation was frequently associated with an increase in number of days with high rainfall 15 and 30 mm similar findings were made by klein tank and können 2003 who concluded that a significant part of the recent annual precipitation increase in northern europe is due to very wet days that study was based on observed data 1946 1999 and was thus not impacted by the bias of climate models in failing to depict extreme values bengtsson and rana 2014 compared changes in annual total precipitation and number of days with 20 30 and 40 mm rainfall in southern sweden over a 30 year period and found a significant increase in annual precipitation which they associated with an increase in extreme daily rainfall events but only during winter in another study projecting the rainfall regime to the end of the century with a statistical downscaling method of two gcms chen et al 2015 found that a decreasing number of days with precipitation 0 1 mm was associated with an increase in the average volume of rain per rainy day and the number of days with 25 and 40 mm rainfall those studies all show similar indications for southern sweden with an increase in precipitation associated with an increase in the number of high daily rainfall events however differences in definitions of indicators annual rainfall monthly rainfall months included in seasonal definition wet days and high daily rainfall threshold hinder direct comparison of studies smhi s official definition of an extreme daily rainfall event in sweden 40 mm day is purely meteorological and not particularly relevant in an agricultural context in this study the thresholds of 15 and 30 mm day were mainly chosen based on the frequency intensity diagram fig 6 but are very similar to the thresholds used by chen et al 2015 who regarded 20 mm day as a 2 4 times a year return event and 30 mm day as a yearly return event an increasing trend in high daily rainfall was identified in the present study despite the existing limitation of the climate ensemble in depicting those types of events as shown by figs 4 and 5 and reported in the literature prein et al 2015 this suggests that the increase in heavy rainfall events could potentially be even more significant than reported here from the output of the swat model runoff precipitation ratio was calculated as an indicator of the amount of water flowing out of the watershed through fast routes the increase in precipitation regime observed in this study was found to be more likely to be accompanied by an increase in runoff precipitation ratio than an increase in soil water content thus the greater amount of rainfall water projected for southern sweden will not lead to more water for crops quite the contrary when precipitation total and high daily rainfall and runoff rainfall ratio increased the soil water content decreased in some cases similarly destouni and verrot 2014 used a simple rainfall soil moisture model to simulate moisture conditions in sweden during the 20th century and found an increasing frequency of dry pedological events and no change in frequency of wet pedological events with overall increasing precipitation the observations on soil water content formulated here are important in light of findings that air temperature is also projected to rise overall in southern sweden eklund et al 2015 a clear increasing trend in evapotranspirative flux was found for two of our sites skåne and västergötland most likely influenced by increasing temperature however this is probably not the only explanation since eklund et al 2015 showed that the spring and summer temperature is expected to rise slightly more at östergötland than västergötland one reason for the stability of aet at östergötland could be that overall volume of precipitation was relatively stable at that site but associated with an increase in heavy precipitation 30 mm resulting in a stable or decreasing soil water content the assumption can be made that despite the rise in temperature aet will not increase because of lack of available water in the system for evapotranspiration including soil water this assumption is consistent with findings in the global study conducted by jung et al 2010 and the regional study by destouni and verrot 2014 there are uncertainties associated with any modeling work in this study we attempted to minimize and identify the main uncertainties linked to swat modeling and to the use of data from climate models uncertainties arising from inability of the swat model to precisely describe the internal fluxes of the catchment water cycle were reduced through a careful calibration process and analysis of all hydrological components of the model in climate model projection an ensemble of several climate models was used to reduce the uncertainty linked to individual models 5 conclusions this study investigated the relationship between rainfall indicators and monthly water distribution within the hydrological systems of three agricultural watersheds in sweden using regionalized bias corrected climate datasets to feed the agro hydrological model swat the rainfall data from the climate ensemble were first analyzed in terms of total monthly precipitation and frequency of daily rainfall and then the effects on surface and subsurface hydrological fluxes and actual evapotranspiration were examined the climate model ensemble used was found to overestimate total precipitation in very wet months but at the same time had difficulty representing extreme daily rainfall events this could affect simulations of the impact on agricultural systems where water management is a daily to multi day process rather than a monthly or seasonal process despite those limitations the simulated rainfall amount during the cropping season increased at all three study sites in all months except september when it decreased at two sites an increase in total monthly precipitation was generally associated with an increase in high daily rainfall events particularly events 15 mm day it was also associated with an increase in runoff rainfall ratio simulated by the swat model but not in soil water content evapotranspirative flux was found to increase but only at two of the three sites indicating that more complex processes than a rise in temperature and aet explain the stable trend recorded for soil water content in combination the increase in runoff due to heavy rainfall events and the increase in evapotranspiration due to temperature rise may mainly explain the lack of significant increase in soil water content despite the increase in overall precipitation volume thus the present study showed that an increase in future precipitation in sweden will not lead to an increase in soil water content for two main reasons i the increase in precipitation is likely to be associated with an increase in heavy precipitation events that tend to produce more runoff than soil infiltration and ii the increase in temperature will increase evapotranspiration which will deplete soil water reserves the study could be used as a framework for similar investigations in other regions or countries it demonstrates the importance of not only considering the average change in precipitation but also the importance in agro hydrological terms of considering local changes including changes in precipitation frequencies declaration of competing

et al 2010 drainage pipes are approximately 0 1 m diameter pipes embedded at a depth of 1 m below the ground surface the use of drainage pipe leads to a decrease in water tables to improve crop yields in wet but productive soils while increasing nutrient losses through preferential flow paths through micropores arnold et al 1999 green et al 2006 wilson et al 2018 in agricultural regions nutrient

pipe locations potential nutrient sources to better understand and characterize nutrient dynamics for an improved assessment of environmental quality and quantity however the maps of drainage pipe locations are subject to private ownership leading to limited accessibility to reliable and comprehensive drain line maps over a large area distinct surface features caused by drainage pipe can be

events lam et al 2016 woo and kumar 2019 fig 1 illustrates the principle function of subsurface drainage systems due to preferential flow toward drainage pipes in microporous fields a convex shape of soil moisture between drainage pipes is developed as time progresses soil moisture becomes relatively low at areas adjacent to drainage pipes and relatively high at areas away from drainage pipes fig

corresponding relation between albedo and water content surface albedo increases with decreasing soil moisture and vice versa sugathan et al 2014 wang et al 2005 that is after precipitation events near surface soils above drainage pipes have a higher albedo compared to areas relatively distant from drainage pipes developing a brighter soil surface these spatial patterns and evolutionary

edge filters to optical images kratt et al 2020 naz et al 2009 despite the potential these approaches often suffer from false pipe detections due to the difficulty in differentiating drainage pipe features from other surface features e g tillage and depression this high uncertainty leads to the low reliability of identified drainage pipe locations this challenge has been partly resolved using thermal images accounting for the water dependence of thermal conductivity woo et al 2019 and gpr images based on subsurface soil moisture allred 2013 allred et al 2004 allred and redman 2010 however limited thermal and gpr data availability restricts thermal and gpr image based approaches to a few sites and therefore hinders their practical applications recent breakthroughs in the deep learning

successful implementations in various computer vision tasks there are no earlier studies in which a deep learning based approach for drainage pipe detection using optical image datasets is explored to our knowledge here we propose a novel drainage pipe detection approach based on deep learning on optical image datasets in our approach a fully convolutional network fcn takes an optical image patch as an input and gives an output pixel wise drain line detection map the optical image dataset to train and test the fcn is obtained from the freeware google earth google inc mountain view ca our approach provides the following advantages 1 training and testing datasets can be easily obtained from google earth and 2 the drain line detection performance is robust against surface features that are not relevant to drainage pipes 2 methods 2 1 optical image data optical images were collected from google earth considering its high spatial and temporal resolutions and open source as noted by hu et al 2013 there is no considerable difference between google earth images and original optical images at a pixel level to configure reliable datasets pairs of images and the corresponding labeled images representing drainage pipes for training a deep learning model we considered the following four criteria 1 more than 2 54 mm of precipitation occurred between 4 and 10 days before images were taken woo et al 2019 2 no precipitation occurred for 3 days before images were taken to allow excess water to drain while developing surface albedo features relevant to drainage systems bright soil surface allred et al 2020 3 images were taken in regions where subsurface drainage systems were widely used to remove excess water and 4 bare soils were present to reduce uncertainty associated with vegetation features to evaluate the first and second criteria we obtained precipitation data from nearby weather stations from weather underground https www wunderground com for the third criterion we explored potential study sites over ohio state where subsurface drain systems were extensively practiced for crop productions more than 55 of agricultural areas usda 1987 for the fourth criterion we chose images taken during non growing seasons bare soil images considering these criteria we collected 513 images with a size of 256 256 pixels and a pixel resolution up to 30 cm per pixel an example of image collection procedures is illustrated in fig 2 the study site is located near sunbury ohio united states latitude 40 21 and longitude 82 82 the soil type is a mixture of silt loam and clay loam which is classified as poorly drained soils this field has been used for row crop production with drainage pipes installed at a depth of 1 m king et al 2016 a layout for a known drainage system from king et al 2016 is presented in fig 2a three images taken on apr 29 2006 nov 2 2011 and jun 13 2014 fig 2b d respectively were obtained from google earth daily precipitation and temperature during 30 day period before the images were taken are presented in fig 2e g consistent with a previous study woo et al 2019 we also found that drain lines were clearly visible when precipitation occurred between 4 and 10 days before images were taken that is precipitation events in drained fields develop a convex shape of soil moisture between drainage pipes due to preferential flow paths resulting in a higher surface albedo above drainage pipes than the other areas on the other hand air temperature variations did not influence their visibility that is the visibility of drainage pipes in fig 2b outweighs that in fig 2c and d with these procedures we labeled drain lines from the obtained images with an image annotating tool developed by geiger et al 2014 2 2 fully convolutional network for drain line detection the network architecture of the fully convolutional network fcn used in this study is shown in fig 3 we adopted a well known fcn for image segmentation u net ronneberger et al 2015 and modified it by incorporating skip connections to enable residual learning the fcn used in this study takes an encoder decoder type architecture as shown in fig 3 the encoding layers take an optical image 256 256 3 pixels as an input generate high dimensional feature vectors and aggregate feature vectors at multiple levels then the decoding layers decode the aggregated features at multiple levels and generate an output of a possible drain line map 256 256 pixels indicating drain pipe locations each pixel value of the output drain line map image ranging from zero to one indicates the possibility of the pixel representing a drainage pipe the details of each operational unit shown in fig 3 such as 2 d convolution relu activation and batch normalization can be found elsewhere goodfellow et al 2016 ronneberger et al 2015 to avoid overfitting dropout regularization layers were included throughout the network the fcn model used in this study was developed and trained in the following environment python 3 7 tensorflow 1 13 1 and keras 2 2 4 a python code for the developed model is available at https github com hominsong36 unet tile 2 3 network training the fcn described in section 2 2 was trained using the configured optical image dataset 513 optical images were divided into 256 training images and 257 validation images to expand the size of training image set we used image augmentation techniques such as horizontal and vertical flips random rotation random brightness adjustment and random zoom buslaev et al 2020 with these procedures we created additional 2816 training images from the original 256 images resulting in total 3027 training images note that the image augmentation techniques were not used for the validation images we used the dice loss function l dice a widely used loss function for semantic image segmentation research as an indicator to evaluate our model performance sudre et al 2017 l dice is given by 1 l dice 1 dice and 2 dice 2 i 1 n t i p i i 1 n t i i 1 n p i where t i is the label of the i th pixel of the label image p i is the predicted probability that the i th pixel of the predicted output image is on a drain region n is the total number of pixels in the labeled and predicted images the maximum and minimum possible dice coefficient values eq 2 are 1 0 and 0 that represent 100 and 0 overlap between the detected and ground truth drain line locations respectively training of the fcn was carried out to find its optimal weights that minimizes the dice loss function presented in eq 1 note that an l dice value closer to 0 represents good drain line detection performance during the network training process dice eq 2 is used to quantitatively measure the drain line detection performance in the network application phase once the network training is complete 3 results the training and validation loss histories of the fcn used in this study is shown in fig 4 as seen in the fig 4 both training blue solid line and validation orange dashed line losses decreased gradually over the training epochs the minimum dice losses obtained through the training phase were 0 28 and 0 42 for the training and validation sets over 500 epochs respectively fig 5 shows large scale drain line detection results on the validation dataset fig 5a is an input optical image fig 5b shows the ground truth image where actual pipe locations are indicated as white pixels having a pixel intensity of one fig 5c shows the trained network output drain line map images where the pixel intensity represents the possibility of a pixel representing a drainage pipe location the dimension of the large scale image is 3584 3072 3 pixels and that of the ground truth and network output images fig 5b and c respectively is 3584 3072 pixels to create the drain line map image the original input image was divided into 168 small scale images with a dimension of 256 256 3 pixels and the trained network was applied consecutively on the divided images note that the 168 small scale images are included in the validation image set the 168 small scale drain line map images obtained using the trained network were then merged to develop a large scale drain line map image three example small scale images were selected from each large scale image and shown in bottom sub figures in fig 5 in the results the output drain line map image from the trained network fig 5c shows good agreement with the ground truth image fig 5b most drainage pipe locations indicated in the ground truth image fig 5b were clearly detected in the network output image shown in fig 5c the dice coefficient shown in eq 2 can be computed for both small scale zoom in plots in fig 5c and large scale drain line detection images the average dice coefficient obtained over the entire 257 validation drain line detection output images small scale was 0 58 the large scale output drain line map image shown in fig 5c provided a dice coefficient of 0 55 the trained fcn was applied to two large scale test images seen in figs 6a and 7a to investigate the robustness of the proposed deep learning approach note that the tested input images have not been used either to train or validate the fcn and thus are completely unseen images to the network the large scale drain line detection results for the two test input images are shown in figs 6 and 7 some of known actual drainage pipe locations for the first tested image fig 6a are indicated in fig 2a compared to the actual drainage pipe locations fig 2a the overall drain distributions were well indicated in the network output image fig 6b although not all of the drainage pipes were perfectly detected these differences may be due to clogged drainage pipes caused by sediments and or spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the permeability of the soil the outputs of the trained fcn for the second tested image displayed in fig 7b indicate possible drainage pipes installed belowground the detected drain lines in the three zoom in plots of fig 7b show good agreement with the bright intensity regions in the zoom in plots of fig 7a that are commonly caused by subsurface drainage note that the two test images shown in figs 6a and 7a are test images without labeled drain line images hence dice coefficients are not reported the presented results shown in figs 5 to 7 demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the proposed deep learning approach for effective detection of drainage pipe locations using optical images 4 discussions 4 1 performance comparison with edge detection techniques to demonstrate the robustness of our approach we compare the drain pipe detection performance of the proposed deep learning approach with existing image processing techniques to detect edge like features sobel and canny edge detection techniques canny 1986 kanopoulos et al 1988 that are widely accepted for image recognition were used for the comparison since naz et al 2009 used edge enhance filters on aerial imagery to locate subsurface drainage pipes figs 5d 6c and 7d show the detected edges using the sobel edge detector from the validation and two test optical images shown in figs 5a 6a and 7a respectively the corresponding edge detection results using the canny edge detector are shown in figs 5e 6d and 7d respectively for the case of the validation image fig 5d and e it is shown that acceptable detection results were achieved via sobel and canny edge detectors compared to the ground truth drain line image shown in fig 5b however the drain line detection image obtained by sobel and canny edge detectors fig 5d and e were noisier than that obtained by our deep learning approach fig 5c a considerable amount of false detection was made by sobel and canny edge detectors while our deep learning approach provided near false detection free features see fig 5c importantly for the case of the two test images we noted that sobel and canny edge detectors generated gritty and noisy images figs 6c and d 7c and d and thus it was not feasible to identify subsurface drainage pipe locations these unsatisfactory performances may be due to a low contrast between drain line features and backgrounds in the input optical image that is conventional edge detection methods to identify the locations of subsurface drain pipes are highly subjective to the quality of optical images note that our deep learning approach nevertheless achieved successful drain line detection performances as shown in figs 6b and 7b the comparison between our deep learning approach and sobel and canny edge detection approaches demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of our deep learning approach in detecting subsurface drainage pipes 4 2 further suggestions to obtain better drain pipe detection results although the proposed deep learning drain pipe detection approach provides good performance of drain pipe detection the performance can be further improved we assert that tuning hyperparameters and incorporating more diverse datasets can further improve the drain pipe detection performance the hyperparameters used in this study e g the learning rate batch size etc are suboptimal and there is a possibility to achieve optimal hyperparameters providing a lower validation error and hence higher drain line detection accuracy a systematic search technique such as the grid search and random search can be incorporated to obtain optimized hyperparameters bergstra and bengio 2012 incorporating more diverse datasets can also improve the drain pipe detection performance by making a trained deep learning model more generalized the more diverse dataset the deep learning model is trained with the better drain pipe detection performance the trained model provides on new test input images however these suggested improvements are beyond the scope of this study in this study we demonstrated the potential of an fcn to accurately detect drain pipes and its effectiveness to overcome the limitations of conventional image processing methods 5 conclusions this paper presents a deep learning based drainage pipe detection approach using optical images obtained from google earth platform based on the presented results the following conclusions are drawn 1 stable training and validation of the deep learning model are achieved showing that training and validation errors decrease gradually over the training epochs 2 the proposed deep learning approach shows accurate and robust drain line detection performances on the validation and test image datasets 3 the proposed deep learning approach offers superior drain pipe detection performances over widely accepted edge detection image processing techniques sobel and canny edge

drainage systems using i optical images kratt et al 2020 naz et al 2009 ii thermal images woo et al 2019 and iii ground penetrating radar gpr images allred 2013 allred et al 2004 allred and redman 2010 for the optical image based approaches subsurface drainage pipes were identified in bare soil after precipitation events by applying conventional image processing such as horizontal and vertical edge filters to optical images kratt et al 2020 naz et al 2009 despite the potential these approaches often suffer from false pipe detections due to the difficulty in differentiating drainage pipe features from other surface features e g tillage and depression this high uncertainty leads to the low reliability of identified drainage pipe locations this challenge has been partly resolved using thermal images accounting for the water dependence of thermal conductivity woo et al 2019 and gpr images based on subsurface soil moisture allred 2013 allred et al 2004 allred and redman 2010 however limited thermal and gpr data availability restricts thermal and gpr image based approaches to a few sites and therefore hinders their practical applications recent breakthroughs in the deep learning have offered new guidelines to solve various challenging scientific problems lecun et al 2015 liu et al 2018 ronneberger et al 2015 weigert et al 2018 deep learning is a data driven computational methodology that makes use of multilayered artificial neural networks and or their variants to learn complex mapping functions between input and output data from a large volume of dataset in the field of computer vision deep learning has been actively applied to solve various image related tasks including image classification object detection and image segmentation liu et al 2018 despite the successful implementations in various computer vision tasks there are no earlier studies in which a deep learning based approach for drainage pipe detection using optical image datasets is explored to our knowledge here we propose a novel drainage pipe detection approach based on deep learning on optical image datasets in our approach a fully convolutional network fcn takes an optical image patch as an input and gives an output pixel wise drain line detection map the optical image dataset to train and test the fcn is obtained from the freeware google earth google inc mountain view ca our approach provides the following advantages 1 training and testing datasets can be easily obtained from google earth and 2 the drain line detection performance is robust against surface features that are not relevant to drainage pipes 2 methods 2 1 optical image data optical images were collected from google earth considering its high spatial and temporal resolutions and open source as noted by hu et al 2013 there is no considerable difference between google earth images and original optical images at a pixel level to configure reliable datasets pairs of images and the corresponding labeled images representing drainage pipes for training a deep learning model we considered the following four criteria 1 more than 2 54 mm of precipitation occurred between 4 and 10 days before images were taken woo et al 2019 2 no precipitation occurred for 3 days before images were taken to allow excess water to drain while developing surface albedo features relevant to drainage systems bright soil surface allred et al 2020 3 images were taken in regions where subsurface drainage systems were widely used to remove excess water and 4 bare soils were present to reduce uncertainty associated with vegetation features to evaluate the first and second criteria we obtained precipitation data from nearby weather stations from weather underground https www wunderground com for the third criterion we explored potential study sites over ohio state where subsurface drain systems were extensively practiced for crop productions more than 55 of agricultural areas usda 1987 for the fourth criterion we chose images taken during non growing seasons bare soil images considering these criteria we collected 513 images with a size of 256 256 pixels and a pixel resolution up to 30 cm per pixel an example of image collection procedures is illustrated in fig 2 the study site is located near sunbury ohio united states latitude 40 21 and longitude 82 82 the soil type is a mixture of silt loam and clay loam which is classified as poorly drained soils this field has been used for row crop production with drainage pipes installed at a depth of 1 m king et al 2016 a layout for a known drainage system from king et al 2016 is presented in fig 2a three images taken on apr 29 2006 nov 2 2011 and jun 13 2014 fig 2b d respectively were obtained from google earth daily precipitation and temperature during 30 day period before the images were taken are presented in fig 2e g consistent with a previous study woo et al 2019 we also found that drain lines were clearly visible when precipitation occurred between 4 and 10 days before images were taken that is precipitation events in drained fields develop a convex shape of soil moisture between drainage pipes due to preferential flow paths resulting in a higher surface albedo above drainage pipes than the other areas on the other hand air temperature variations did not influence their visibility that is the visibility of drainage pipes in fig 2b outweighs that in fig 2c and d with these procedures we labeled drain lines from the obtained images with an image annotating tool developed by geiger et al 2014 2 2 fully convolutional network for drain line detection the network architecture of the fully convolutional network fcn used in this study is shown in fig 3 we adopted a well known fcn for image segmentation u net ronneberger et al 2015 and modified it by incorporating skip connections to enable residual learning the fcn used in this study takes an encoder decoder type architecture as shown in fig 3 the encoding layers take an optical image 256 256 3 pixels as an input generate high dimensional feature vectors and aggregate feature vectors at multiple levels then the decoding layers decode the aggregated features at multiple levels and generate an output of a possible drain line map 256 256 pixels indicating drain pipe locations each pixel value of the output drain line map image ranging from zero to one indicates the possibility of the pixel representing a drainage pipe the details of each operational unit shown in fig 3 such as 2 d convolution relu activation and batch normalization can be found elsewhere goodfellow et al 2016 ronneberger et al 2015 to avoid overfitting dropout regularization layers were included throughout the network the fcn model used in this study was developed and trained in the following environment python 3 7 tensorflow 1 13 1 and keras 2 2 4 a python code for the developed model is available at https github com hominsong36 unet tile 2 3 network training the fcn described in section 2 2 was trained using the configured optical image dataset 513 optical images were divided into 256 training images and 257 validation images to expand the size of training image set we used image augmentation techniques such as horizontal and vertical flips random rotation random brightness adjustment and random zoom buslaev et al 2020 with these procedures we created additional 2816 training images from the original 256 images resulting in total 3027 training images note that the image augmentation techniques were not used for the validation images we used the dice loss function l dice a widely used loss function for semantic image segmentation research as an indicator to evaluate our model performance sudre et al 2017 l dice is given by 1 l dice 1 dice and 2 dice 2 i 1 n t i p i i 1 n t i i 1 n p i where t i is the label of the i th pixel of the label image p i is the predicted probability that the i th pixel of the predicted output image is on a drain region n is the total number of pixels in the labeled and predicted images the maximum and minimum possible dice coefficient values eq 2 are 1 0 and 0 that represent 100 and 0 overlap between the detected and ground truth drain line locations respectively training of the fcn was carried out to find its optimal weights that minimizes the dice loss function presented in eq 1 note that an l dice value closer to 0 represents good drain line detection performance during the network training process dice eq 2 is used to quantitatively measure the drain line detection performance in the network application phase once the network training is complete 3 results the training and validation loss histories of the fcn used in this study is shown in fig 4 as seen in the fig 4 both training blue solid line and validation orange dashed line losses decreased gradually over the training epochs the minimum dice losses obtained through the training phase were 0 28 and 0 42 for the training and validation sets over 500 epochs respectively fig 5 shows large scale drain line detection results on the validation dataset fig 5a is an input optical image fig 5b shows the ground truth image where actual pipe locations are indicated as white pixels having a pixel intensity of one fig 5c shows the trained network output drain line map images where the pixel intensity represents the possibility of a pixel representing a drainage pipe location the dimension of the large scale image is 3584 3072 3 pixels and that of the ground truth and network output images fig 5b and c respectively is 3584 3072 pixels to create the drain line map image the original input image was divided into 168 small scale images with a dimension of 256 256 3 pixels and the trained network was applied consecutively on the divided images note that the 168 small scale images are included in the validation image set the 168 small scale drain line map images obtained using the trained network were then merged to develop a large scale drain line map image three example small scale images were selected from each large scale image and shown in bottom sub figures in fig 5 in the results the output drain line map image from the trained network fig 5c shows good agreement with the ground truth image fig 5b most drainage pipe locations indicated in the ground truth image fig 5b were clearly detected in the network output image shown in fig 5c the dice coefficient shown in eq 2 can be computed for both small scale zoom in plots in fig 5c and large scale drain line detection images the average dice coefficient obtained over the entire 257 validation drain line detection output images small scale was 0 58 the large scale output drain line map image shown in fig 5c provided a dice coefficient of 0 55 the trained fcn was applied to two large scale test images seen in figs 6a and 7a to investigate the robustness of the proposed deep learning approach note that the tested input images have not been used either to train or validate the fcn and thus are completely unseen images to the network the large scale drain line detection results for the two test input images are shown in figs 6 and 7 some of known actual drainage pipe locations for the first tested image fig 6a are indicated in fig 2a compared to the actual drainage pipe locations fig 2a the overall drain distributions were well indicated in the network output image fig 6b although not all of the drainage pipes were perfectly detected these differences may be due to clogged drainage pipes caused by sediments and or spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the permeability of the soil the outputs of the trained fcn for the second tested image displayed in fig 7b indicate possible drainage pipes installed belowground the detected drain lines in the three zoom in plots of fig 7b show good agreement with the bright intensity regions in the zoom in plots of fig 7a that are commonly caused by subsurface drainage note that the two test images shown in figs 6a and 7a are test images without labeled drain line images hence dice coefficients are not reported the presented results shown in figs 5 to 7 demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the proposed deep learning approach for effective detection of drainage pipe locations using optical images 4 discussions 4 1 performance comparison with edge detection techniques to demonstrate the robustness of our approach we compare the drain pipe detection performance of the proposed deep learning approach with existing image processing techniques to detect edge like features sobel and canny edge detection techniques canny 1986 kanopoulos et al 1988 that are widely accepted for image recognition were used for the comparison since naz et al 2009 used edge enhance filters on aerial imagery to locate subsurface drainage pipes figs 5d 6c and 7d show the detected edges using the sobel edge detector from the validation and two test optical images shown in figs 5a 6a and 7a respectively the corresponding edge detection results using the canny edge detector are shown in figs 5e 6d and 7d respectively for the case of the validation image fig 5d and e it is shown that acceptable detection results were achieved via sobel and canny edge detectors compared to the ground truth drain line image shown in fig 5b however the drain line detection image obtained by sobel and canny edge detectors fig 5d and e were noisier than that obtained by our deep learning approach fig 5c a considerable amount of false detection was made by sobel and canny edge detectors while our deep learning approach provided near false detection free features see fig 5c importantly for the case of the two test images we noted that sobel and canny edge detectors generated gritty and noisy images figs 6c and d 7c and d and thus it was not feasible to identify subsurface drainage pipe locations these unsatisfactory performances may be due to a low contrast between drain line features and backgrounds in the input optical image that is conventional edge detection methods to identify the locations of subsurface drain pipes are highly subjective to the quality of optical images note that our deep learning approach nevertheless achieved successful drain line detection performances as shown in figs 6b and 7b the comparison between our deep learning approach and sobel and canny edge detection approaches demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of our deep learning approach in detecting subsurface drainage pipes 4 2 further suggestions to obtain better drain pipe detection results although the proposed deep learning drain pipe detection approach provides good performance of drain pipe detection the performance can be further improved we assert that tuning hyperparameters and incorporating more diverse datasets can further improve the drain pipe detection performance the hyperparameters used in this study e g the learning rate batch size etc are suboptimal and there is a possibility to achieve optimal hyperparameters providing a lower validation error and hence higher drain line detection accuracy a systematic search technique such as the grid search and random search can be incorporated to obtain optimized hyperparameters bergstra and bengio 2012 incorporating more diverse datasets can also improve the drain pipe detection performance by making a trained deep learning model more generalized the more diverse dataset the deep learning model is trained with the better drain pipe detection performance the trained model provides on new test input images however these suggested improvements are beyond the scope of this study in this study we demonstrated the potential of an fcn to accurately detect drain pipes and its effectiveness to overcome the limitations of conventional image processing methods 5 conclusions this paper presents a deep learning based drainage pipe detection approach using optical images obtained from google earth platform based on the presented results the following conclusions are drawn 1 stable training and validation of the deep learning model are achieved showing that training and validation errors decrease gradually over the training epochs 2 the proposed deep learning approach shows accurate and robust drain line detection performances on the validation and test image datasets 3 the proposed deep learning approach offers superior drain pipe detection performances over widely accepted edge detection image processing techniques sobel and canny edge
