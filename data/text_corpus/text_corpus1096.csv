5480,landfill leachate often contains soluble hazardous substances geomembrane gm liner is commonly used to protect the subsurface water the leachate however may diffuse through the gm and enter the underlying natural soil liner analytical or numerical modeling for the leachate transport in the soils helps assess the associated risk to groundwater resources the analytical model has the advantages of simplicity and easy to implement over the numerical model yet there is only an analytical model developed for describing the leachate migration through the gm to the unsaturated soil liner its solution however is difficult to evaluate we herein develop a new analytical model to include the sorption effect and simplify the leachate transport through the gm as a robin type boundary condition in the model the solution of the model is in a simple form and very easy to evaluate the present solution is then compared with a finite difference solution and the existing solution the effect of the retardation factor on the leachate migration is investigated a sensitivity analysis is also performed to assess the effects of model parameters on the leachate distribution finally the present

municipal waste by confining the compacted wastes in a small area the waste in landfills usually has dissolved material that generates leachate mixed with the infiltrated water from precipitation leachate may be highly hazardous to the environment renou et al 2008 because it contains high inorganic compounds e g nitrogen ammonia nitrite cyanide chloride or heavy metals and organic compounds with extreme ph chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand talalaj 2015 kamaruddin et al 2017 numerous studies have focused on removing or reducing the unfavorable effect of leachate through off site treatments by adopting the chemical method iskander et al 2019 ruiz delgado et al 2019 biodegradation method li et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 physical method nomura et al 2019 or their combinations geomembrane gm is commonly employed as a liner to prevent the hazardous substances of leachate directly contacting with the subsurface soils qiu 2011 han et al 2016 feng et al 2019 the gm mainly comprises reinforced polymeric materials biron 2018 with low permeability ranging from 10 12 m s to 10 15 m s whittle and ling 2002 the leachate may however exude from the gm due to a long time diffusion process and continuously pollute the subsurface soils and groundwater sepa 2003 thus a comprehension of the diffusion process associated with leachate migration is crucial in assessing the risk of groundwater contamination and the development of remediation strategy bjerg et al 2003 yenigül et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 analytical approaches dealing with the leachate transport through the gm liner to the adjacent saturated soil liner have evolved in several studies foose 2002 presented a one dimensional 1 d model for describing the volatile organic compounds vocs diffusing in a two layered liner consisted of the gm liner and soil liner of semi infinite extent he set the leachate concentration as constant to conservatively predict the concentration distribution in both layers chen et al 2009 developed an analytical transport model in 1 d multi layered media they assumed the leachate concentration is subject to exponential decay further cleall and li 2011 modified foose s 2002 work by accounting for a finite extent soil liner for the distribution of vocs guan et al 2014 considered the effects of both biodegradation and advection in the 1 d model for contaminant transport in geosynthetic clay and soil liners the transport equation for the contaminant in geosynthetic clay liner however is under the steady state condition xie et al 2013 developed an analytical solution for the organic contaminant diffusion through a composite liner comprising either a gm and a compacted clay liner or a gm and a geosynthetic clay liner the transport model consists of a steady state diffusion equation in the gm and a transient equation with the effects of the retardation and degradation in the liner chen et al 2015 investigated various combinations of the composite liners consisting of the gm compacted clay geosynthetic clay and or soil liners using a 1 d analytical transport model xie et al 2015a proposed an analytical model for describing the organic contaminants distribution in a three layer liner consisting of a gm a geosynthetic clay liner and a soil liner compacted clay liner the transport equations for the gm and geosynthetic clay liner were assumed to be stationary while the transient diffusion equation was adopted for the soil liner compacted clay liner later xie et al 2015b extended their prior work to consider the effect of advective velocity due to the presence of the defects in the gm recently feng et al 2019 developed a transient analytical model for three layered liner consisting of a defected gm geosynthetic clay and soil liners with considering the effect of advective velocity previous studies have exclusively focused on contaminant transport in saturated media yet landfills are commonly constructed in arid or semiarid areas in its natural state the underlying soil liner is normally unsaturated fityus et al 1999 liu and hu 2014 the water content distributed in the unsaturated soils varies along with the depth hence the transport process in the unsaturated soils differs from that in the saturated one nielsen et al 1986 chen et al 2019 were the first to derive an analytical solution to a 1 d transport model describing the contaminant distribution in the gm liner and unsaturated soils they adopted the gardner 1958 model to depict the water content distribution in unsaturated soils subject to the hydrostatic equilibrium the time domain solutions to their model for the gm and underlying soils are obtained by applying the laplace transform and the residue theorem their solution consists of two infinite sums and the functions in the sums should be evaluated with a root finding procedure to determine the roots of nonlinear equations arisen from the use of the residue theorem the solution is checked through the comparison with the finite element solution implemented in the hydrus 1d software simunek et al 1998 in light of this a simplified analytical solution with the merits of good accuracy and easy evaluation for predicting contaminant behavior or estimating transport parameters should be a good alternative the gm liner is commonly within two millimeters the soil liner is about a few meters krishna et al 2017 and the thickness of the vadose zone sometimes is over ten meters phillips and castro 2003 instead of using the transport equation for describing the leachate migration in the gm fick s first law is adopted to depict the leachate migration in the gm this approach leads to a robin type boundary condition at the top of natural soil liner fityus et al 1999 for the leachate transport in the soils similar to chen et al s 2019 work the gardner exponential model is employed to depict the water content profile in the soils under the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium different from chen et al s 2019 work the present model accounts for the sorption effect and add a constant retardation factor in the transport equation for the leachate in soils an analytical solution for describing the spatiotemporal distribution of leachate concentration in the unsaturated soil liner is then developed a finite difference model developed for leachate transport in unsaturated soils and chen et al s 2019 solution are employed to check the validities of using the hydrostatic equilibrium condition constant retardation factor and robin type condition this new solution is then used to evaluate the effect of the retardation factor on the leachate migration moreover a sensitivity analysis with the help of differential importance measure is performed to assess the effect of each of the model variables and parameters on the leachate concentration finally the present solution is applied to estimate the transport parameters for data obtained from laboratory experiments in a chamber with composite liners conducted by park et al 2012 2 method fig 1 is the schematic diagram to illustrate the leachate migration through a gm to the underlying natural soil liner the origin of the coordinate system is at the bottom of the gm with a positive axis downward the 1 d transport equations in the gm and soil liner can be respectively expressed as bear 1979 chen et al 2019 1a r g c g t d g 2 c g z 2 l g z 0 and 1b r u θ c u t z d u c u z 0 z l u where the subscripts g and u denote the gm and underlying soils respectively c m l3 is the leachate concentration r is the retardation factor representing a measure of the amount of contaminant slowed due to the sorption effect mojid and vereecken 2005 d l2 t is the diffusion coefficient note that d u l2 t can be expressed as d u d u θ where d u l2 t is the effective diffusion coefficient defined as τ d 0 with tortuosity τ and aqueous diffusion coefficient d 0 l2 t t t is the elapsed time z l is the depth from the bottom of the gm liner θ is the water content which varies with depth and the variables l l is the associated thickness consider the flow system is clean initially the initial condition for the leachate concentration in both gm and soils is therefore expressed as 2 c g c u 0 t 0 the gm liner is usually made of nonporous polymers with randomly distributed voids park and nibras 1993 the migration of the leachate through the gm is mainly affected by the processes of partition and diffusion at the top of the gm the leachate may be considered to maintain a constant concentration denoted as c 0 m l3 the associated condition is written as 3 c g s g c 0 z l g where s g is the partition coefficient defined as the ratio of the concentration in the gm to that in the leachate at equilibrium park and bontoux 1991 park and nibras 1993 foose 2002 chen et al 2019 chen et al 2019 considered that the underlying soil is of finite extent in their model and with a zero concentration condition or no flux condition at the bottom the natural soil liner however is about three orders of magnitude thicker than the gm one might expect that the effect of the bottom boundary condition on the leachate distribution is minor the natural soil liner is therefore viewed as semi infinite extent chen et al 2015 feng et al 2019 the no flux condition at the remote boundary is expressed as 4 c u z 0 z at the interface between the gm and soil liner the following conditions are required 5a c g s g c u z 0 and 5b d g c g z d u θ c u z z 0 the partition coefficients between the gm liner and leachate and between the gm and underlying soil liner may be different however for the sake of simplicity both are assumed the same see e g foose 2002 chen et al 2009 xie et al 2015b and equal to s g 2 1 derivation of robin type condition for gm the diffusive flux j mt 1l 2 of contaminants through the gm may be described by fick s first law written as 6 j d g c g z the gm liner is quite thin compared with the soil liner therefore the numerator on the right hand side rhs of eq 6 may be expressed as the concentration difference between the top and the bottom of the gm hence the rhs term of eq 6 may be approximated as 7 d g c g z d g c g z 0 c g z l g l g on the basis of eqs 3 5a and 5b the flux through the gm to the underlying soils becomes 8 d u θ c u z d g s g c u s g c 0 l g z 0 which is a robin type condition or the third type condition in mathematics it can reduce to the dirichlet boundary condition if d g d u or neumann boundary condition if d g d u the former means that d g is very large resulting in a fixed leachate concentration at the interface between the gm and soil surface on the other hand the latter implies that d g is very small so that the gm liner becomes an impermeable layer however the d g is generally smaller than the d u thus eq 8 would not become the dirichlet type condition in reality 2 2 transport model and analytical solution according to the gardner 1958 model θ can be expressed as 9a θ θ r θ s θ r e β ψ where θ r and θ s are respectively the residual and saturated water contents β l 1 is the unsaturated exponent related to the pore size distribution of the soils ψ l is the pressure head note that the gardner 1958 model is commonly used to derive analytical solutions of unsaturated flow but is not flexible to provide accurate descriptions of real world problems as compared with the van genuchten mualem equation used in the numerical models mentioned in ghezzehei et al 2007 the hydraulic head h l in the soils is defined as the sum of the pressure head and elevation head denoted as l u z then h ψ l u z if the flow in the unsaturated soil liner is under hydrostatic equilibrium h in the soils keeps as zero tartakovsky and neuman 2007 resulting in ψ z l u further considering θ r is small and negligible eq 9a becomes 9b θ θ s e β z l u for a linear sorption the retardation factor r u is denoted as 1 ρ κ θ with bulk density ρ ml 3 and solid water partition coefficient κ l3m 1 in this study the r u is assumed as a constant and expressed as 1 ρ κ θ s because the change in water content is small mentioned in section 3 1 based on the comparison of the predicted results from the present solution and numerical model then eqs 1b and 8 can be respectively expressed as 10 r u c u t d u 2 c u z 2 β c u z 0 z l u and 11 d u θ s e β l u c u z d g s g c u s g c 0 l g z 0 on the basis of kumar et al s 2012 work in modelling near subsurface temperature eq 10 with conditions 2 4 and 11 has a solution expressed as 12a c u

discussion in the following study the default values for the parameters or variables such as c 0 s g d u d g θ s and l g are 1 10 4 kg m3 0 032 3 4 10 10 m2 s 6 10 13 m2 s 0 35 and 1 5 10 3 m respectively adopted from chen et al s 2019 work the retardation factor r u is calculated by assuming that ρ 1330 kg m3 and κ 7 5 10 5 m3 kg hence the r u is obtained as 1 1330 7 5 10 5 0 35 which equals 1 285 in addition we assume that l u 1 5 m and β 0 05 m 1 3 1 comparison with finite difference solution the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium in the soil liner may not be held for flowing pore water we herein develop an explicit finite difference method written in python programming language for describing contaminant transport and transient water flow models in soils the flow equation for describing the hydraulic head h in the soils is denoted as 15 θ t z k u k h z 0 z l u where k is the relative permeability which can be described by the gardner 1958 model as e β h z l u k u l t is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil liner and set as 1 10 9 m s the initial condition for the soils is given as 16 h 0 t 0 the boundary conditions specified at the top and bottom of the soil liner are respectively 17 k u k h z k g h h 0 l g z 0 and 18 h 0 z l u where h 0 l is the hydraulic head at the top of the gm and set as 0 3 m according to the federal u s environmental protection agency guide federal register 2000 k g is the hydraulic conductivity of the gm and set as 1 16 10 14 m s the finite difference grids along the z direction are set as z i i δ z for i 0 1 n z where n z is the total number of spatial nodes and δ z is the grid size equal to l u n z the simulation time is chosen as t j j δ t for j 0 1 n t in which n t is the total number of time intervals δ t is the time interval equal to t n t with the total simulation time t using the first order forward euler approximation eq 15 can be approximated as langtangen and linge 2017 19a h i j 1 h i j δ t k u

1 j l u δ z k g k u l g e β h 1 j l u and 22 h n z j 0 similarly eq 1b after replacing r u with 1 ρ κ θ can be discretized as 23a c u i j 1 θ i j ρ κ θ i j 1 ρ κ c ui j δ t d u θ i j 1 ρ κ δ z 2 θ i 1

initial condition for leachate concentration in the soil liner eq 2 is approximated as 24 c u i 0 0 w i t h i 0 1 n z the top boundary condition eq 8 can be expressed as 25 c u 0 j δ z c 0 d g s g c u 1 j d u l g e β h 1 j l u δ z d g s g d u l g e β h 1 j l u the lower boundary specified as no flux condition eq 4 can be written as 26 c n z j c n z 1 j moreover the stability criterions for the flow equation eq 19a and transport equation eq 23a should be respectively fulfilled as langtangen and linge 2017 27a δ t δ z 2 2 m a x k u k where m a x k u k gives k u e β h 0 and 27b δ t δ z 2 2 m a x d u θ where m a x d u θ is θ r θ s θ r e β h 0 thus the time interval δ t should be chosen as 28 δ t 1 2 m i n δ z 2 k u e β h 0 δ z 2 d u θ r d u θ s θ r e β h 0 in the analysis δ z is set as 0 015 and θ r is 0 1 fig 2 shows the spatial distributions of c u c peak and θ predicted by the present solution and finite difference solution and their difference in c u c peak note that c peak is the peak concentration in soils the lower right panel indicates that θ predicted by the finite difference solution seems to be independent of time it may be attributed to the problem that the hydraulic conductivity of the gm is so small that the flow in the soils is negligible the θ used in the present solution deviates from that of the finite difference solution due to the neglect of θ r however the c u c peak distributions predicted by both solutions are in good agreement the largest difference in the concentrations predicted from both solutions is less than 0 008 indicating that the largest difference of 0 007 in the water content predicted by the gardner model doesn t have a significant effect on the concentration prediction therefore assuming the flow in the soils under hydrostatic equilibrium and the constant retardation factor are practically acceptable 3 2 comparison with chen et al s 2019 solution the numerical evaluation for chen et al s 2019 solution may rely on two steps as discussed in detail in appendix a one of the steps involves root finding procedure while the other is to draw a figure to determine the number of terms required to the infinite sum in the solution for the desired accuracy due to its complexity and laborious work the laplace domain solution given in chen et al 2019 eq 17b is used and evaluated using the laplace inversion scheme proposed by stehfest 1970 in the following analysis notice that the present solution eq 12a in terms of the complementary error function is very easy to evaluate especially using the software such as matlab or mathematica fig 3 shows the spatial distribution curves of c u c peak predicted by the present and chen et al s 2019 solutions for the unsaturated exponent β varying from 0 05 m 1 to 5 m 1 at t 10 years the curves predicted by both solutions indicate good agreement for various β s the curves predicted by the present solution slightly deviate from that by chen et al s 2019 solution when z is close to 1 5 m however such a difference is quite small and negligible the results in fig 3 indicate that the robin type boundary condition can also give a good prediction for the migration of the leachate in the gm 3 3 effect of the retardation factor on leachate migration landfill leachate generally has a variety of organic contaminants jiménez et al 2002 the sorption behavior of organic compounds in soils is widely recognized and investigated e g calvet 1989 breus and mishchenko 2006 bronner and goss 2010 the value of the retardation factor larger than unit i e r u 1 indicates the sorption effect making the leachate migration slow on the other hand r u 1 suggests there is no sorption effect on the leachate migration chen et al s 2019 solution only considers the case of r u 1 and thus cannot reflect the sorption effect for organic chemicals on the leachate migration in the soils fig 4 demonstrates the spatial distribution curves of c u c peak predicted by the present solution and chen et al s 2019 solution for the r u varying from 1 to 2 at t 10 years one can observe that the present solution and chen et al s 2019 solution match fairly well for the case r u 1 the concentration curve predicted by the present solution decreases with increasing r u indicating that a larger r u represents a greater sorption effect thereby the contaminant in the leachate migrates a shorter distance these results indicate the limitation of chen et al s 2019 solution in predicting the leachate migration if the sorption effect in the soils is significant in fact their solution can include the sorption effect simply by adding a constant retardation factor in the model 3 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa is a powerful tool to evaluate the effects of various parameters on the model output the normalized sensitivity coefficient is defined as the partial derivative of the model dependent variable for a specific parameter 29a x k p k c p k p k where x k indicates the sensitivity of c u to the k th input parameter p k eq 29a may be approximated by a finite difference formula denoted as liou and yeh 1997 i e 29b x k p k c p k δ p k c p k δ p k where δ p k is chosen as 10 3 p k borgonovo and apostolakis 2001 introduced a relatively new measure of sa called differential importance measure which is widely applied in the area of risk management for decision making borgonovo et al 2003 vinod et al 2003 marseguerra and zio 2004 this measure is defined as 30a dim k δ p k p k p k j 1 n δ p j c p j p j where dim k is the differential importance measure of parameter p k and n is the total number of the model parameters according to eq 29a eq 30a can be written as 30b dim k x k j 1 n x j since x k may be negative the absolute value is taken for it and eq 30b is then expressed as 30c dim k x k j 1 n x j there are eight parameters and variables in total are considered in the sa fig 5 demonstrates the temporal distribution curves for a x k and b dim k observed at z d 0 1 note that a positive x k indicates the increase of a specific parameter or variable leading to an increase in c u contrarily a negative x k implies that an increase in the parameter results in a decrease in c u fig 5 a shows that the effects of the changes in parameters s g d g l g and θ s on the leachate transport increase with time and their effects are relatively larger than the other four parameters at large times on the other hand the effects of the changes in β and l u are small all the time from another perspective the measure dim k provides a good indication for the parameter effect in this case as shown in fig 5 b the dim k curves for the parameters d g l g θ s and d u exhibits rapid changes at time 5 77 days before that time the parameter r u produces the largest effect followed by s g d g l g θ s d u l u and β one can observe that s g d g l g and θ s exert similar effects while l u and β give the same influence on the leachate migration after 5 77 days s g becomes the most sensitive parameter followed by d g l g θ s r u d u l u and β it is because that the s g directly affects the leachate concentration in the gm which is in touch with the soil liner landfills often operate for several decades these results indicate that the parameters associated with the gm and embedded in the robin boundary condition play a dominant role for the leachate migration in the soils 3 5 bench scale composite liner experiment and data analysis park et al 2012 conducted bench scale composite liner experiments comprising a high density polyethylene gm overlying a compacted clay liner the thicknesses of the gm and clay liners were respectively 1 5 10 3 m and 0 12 m five species of vocs i e dichloromethane dcm methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe trichloroethylene tce toluene tol and chlorobenzene cbzh with constant concentration c 0 0 1 kg m3 were filled on the top of gm and measured their concentration at the depths of 0 06 m and 0 09 m below the gm the transport parameters estimated from other tests were used as inputs for foose et al s 2002 finite difference solution and rowe et al s 1983 semi analytical solution to predict the concentration distributions which indicated that the predictions by both solutions are the same they analyzed the concentration data from kinetic batch tests using crank s 1975 analytical solution coupled with the nonlinear least squares method to estimate s g and d g associated with the gm for each voc in addition the values of r u for vocs were determined based on equilibrium batch isotherm tests and linear least square regression the variation among three replicates for those five species measured at 0 06 m seems to be large therefore only the datasets measured at 0 09 m from their replicate 2 are analyzed in this study further these datasets are read from park et al 2012 fig 7 using the webplotdigitizer rohatgi 2018 the present solution is coupled with the levenberg marquardt algorithm given in the mathematica routine nonlinearmodelfit wolfram research inc 2018 to analyze the data and estimate the transport parameters values the standard error of estimate see and mean error me given by yeh 1987 are used to assess the prediction errors table 1 lists estimated parameters and associated prediction errors by the present solution and those used in park et al s 2012 work it is not surprising that the values of see and me of the present solution are much smaller than those given by park et al s 2012 work due to the use of β and the transport parameters for the gm and clay adopted from batch tests the parameters r u s g d u and d g estimated from the present solution and park et al 2012 are roughly on the same order of magnitude the β estimated from the present solution ranges from 0 007 m 1 to 0 03 m 1 which is reasonable for the moist clay liner used in the experiments acharya et al 2012 fig 6 shows the measured concentrations of dcm mtbe tce tol and cbzh represented by empty circles and the temporal concentration distributions predicted by the present solution with estimated parameters listed in table 1 and park et al s 2012 prediction read from their work the figure shows good fits for the predictions from the present solution to the measured data indicating that the present solution can be used to estimate the transport parameters without conducting additional batch tests as did in park et al 2012 4 concluding remarks this study presents an analytical model for describing leachate concentration distribution in unsaturated soil liner due to diffusion through a gm the top of the soil liner is specified under a robin type boundary condition developed based on fick s first law the gardner 1958 model is adopted to depict the soil water content profile with the assumption that the pressure head is under hydrostatic equilibrium compared with chen et al s 2019 solution the present solution is much simpler to evaluate while the retardation factor is also considered to reflect the sorption effect on the leachate migration the applicability of the present solution in estimating the transport parameters is demonstrated in the case of analyzing the measured data from bench scale composite liner experiments the major findings from this study are summarized below 1 a finite difference solution for describing contaminant transport and transient water flow is also developed to check the prediction accuracy of the present solution the results indicate that the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in the soil liner and the use of constant retardation factor are reasonable because the permeability of gm is extremely low 2 the concentrations predicted by the present solution and chen et al s 2019 solution show good agreements for different β values this result indicates that the use of the robin type condition is a good alternative instead of using a transport equation for leachate diffusing through a gm liner 3 the results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the parameters s g d g l g and θ s significantly affect leachate transport in the soil liner while the parameters β and l u have minor effects according to the differential importance measure for the sensitivity analysis the most sensitive parameter after 5 77 days is s g followed by d g l g θ s r u d u l u and β thus the effects of s g d g l g and θ s should be carefully evaluated or assessed for landfill design or pollution control measures credit authorship contribution statement ye chen lin conceptualization methodology validation

since μ m is the unknown in rb m one must determine it from the nonlinear equation eq a2a which unfortunately is impossible to solve analytically therefore a plot for f μ versus μ shown in fig a1 is drawn to observe the curve of f μ and explore the locations of its roots in the first step the figure indicates that the first two roots are roughly at 1 2 and 3 2 and the succeeding roots are located with a uniform interval of about 2 0 then a root finding algorithm such as newton s method yeh 1987 can be employed to determine the exact locations of all the roots that is μ m m 1 2 the second rht of eq a1a has an infinite sum thus one must decide the number of the term used to represent the infinite sum for the desired accuracy of the estimated leachate concentration in the second step fig a2 is plotted to show the value of rb m versus m for z 0 1 m near the bottom of the gm and 14 9 m near the bottom of the unsaturated zone at t 1 day small time and 1 year large time the figure indicates that rb m converges rapidly for large t and slowly for small t the figure also indicates that the number of terms required to calculate rb m with an accuracy to the sixth decimal is about 112 for the

5480,landfill leachate often contains soluble hazardous substances geomembrane gm liner is commonly used to protect the subsurface water the leachate however may diffuse through the gm and enter the underlying natural soil liner analytical or numerical modeling for the leachate transport in the soils helps assess the associated risk to groundwater resources the analytical model has the advantages of simplicity and easy to implement over the numerical model yet there is only an analytical model developed for describing the leachate migration through the gm to the unsaturated soil liner its solution however is difficult to evaluate we herein develop a new analytical model to include the sorption effect and simplify the leachate transport through the gm as a robin type boundary condition in the model the solution of the model is in a simple form and very easy to evaluate the present solution is then compared with a finite difference solution and the existing solution the effect of the retardation factor on the leachate migration is investigated a sensitivity analysis is also performed to assess the effects of model parameters on the leachate distribution finally the present

municipal waste by confining the compacted wastes in a small area the waste in landfills usually has dissolved material that generates leachate mixed with the infiltrated water from precipitation

combinations geomembrane gm is commonly employed as a liner to prevent the hazardous substances of leachate directly contacting with the subsurface soils qiu 2011 han et al 2016 feng et al 2019 the gm mainly comprises reinforced polymeric materials biron 2018 with low permeability ranging from 10 12 m s to 10 15 m s whittle and ling 2002 the leachate may however exude from the gm due to a long time diffusion process and continuously pollute the subsurface soils and groundwater sepa 2003 thus a comprehension of the diffusion process associated with leachate migration is crucial in assessing the risk of groundwater contamination and the development of remediation strategy bjerg et al 2003 yenigül et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 analytical approaches dealing with the leachate transport through the gm liner to the adjacent saturated soil liner have evolved in several studies foose 2002 presented a one dimensional 1 d model for describing the volatile organic compounds vocs diffusing in a two layered liner consisted of the gm liner and soil liner of semi infinite extent he set the leachate concentration as constant to conservatively predict the concentration distribution in both layers chen et al 2009 developed an analytical transport model in 1 d multi layered media they assumed the leachate concentration is subject to exponential decay further cleall and li 2011 modified foose s 2002 work by accounting for a finite extent soil liner for the distribution of vocs guan et al 2014 considered the effects of both biodegradation and advection in the 1 d model for contaminant transport in geosynthetic clay and soil liners the transport equation for the contaminant in geosynthetic clay liner however is under the steady state condition xie et al 2013 developed an analytical solution for the organic contaminant diffusion through a composite liner comprising either a gm and a compacted clay liner or a gm and a geosynthetic clay liner the transport model consists of a steady state diffusion equation in the gm and a transient equation with the effects of the retardation and degradation in the liner chen et al 2015 investigated various combinations of the composite liners consisting of the gm compacted clay geosynthetic clay and or soil liners using a 1 d analytical transport model xie et al 2015a proposed an analytical model for describing the organic contaminants distribution in a three layer liner consisting of a gm a geosynthetic clay liner and a soil liner compacted clay liner the transport equations for the gm and geosynthetic clay liner were assumed to be stationary while the transient diffusion equation was adopted for the soil liner compacted clay liner later xie et al 2015b extended their prior work to consider the effect of advective velocity due to the presence of the defects in the gm recently feng et al 2019 developed a transient analytical model for three layered liner consisting of a defected gm geosynthetic clay and soil liners with considering the effect of advective velocity previous studies have exclusively focused on contaminant transport in saturated media yet landfills are commonly constructed in arid or semiarid areas in its natural state the underlying soil liner is normally unsaturated fityus et al 1999 liu and hu 2014 the water content distributed in the unsaturated soils varies along with the depth hence the transport process in the unsaturated soils differs from that in the saturated one nielsen et al 1986 chen et al 2019 were the first to derive an analytical solution to a 1 d transport model describing the contaminant distribution in the gm liner and unsaturated soils they adopted the gardner 1958 model to depict the water content distribution in unsaturated soils subject to the hydrostatic equilibrium the time domain solutions to their model for the gm and underlying soils are obtained by applying the laplace transform and the residue theorem their solution consists of two infinite sums and the functions in the sums should be evaluated with a root finding procedure to determine the roots of nonlinear equations arisen from the use of the residue theorem the solution is checked through the comparison with the finite element solution implemented in the hydrus 1d software simunek et al 1998 in light of this a simplified analytical solution with the merits of good accuracy and easy evaluation for predicting contaminant behavior or estimating transport parameters should be a good alternative the gm liner is commonly within two millimeters the soil liner is about a few meters krishna et al 2017 and the thickness of the vadose zone sometimes is over ten meters phillips and castro 2003 instead of using the transport equation for describing the leachate migration in the gm fick s first law is adopted to depict the leachate migration in the gm this approach leads to a robin type boundary condition at the top of natural soil liner fityus et al 1999 for the leachate transport in the soils similar to chen et al s 2019 work the gardner exponential model is employed to depict the water content profile in the soils under the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium different from chen et al s 2019 work the present model accounts for the sorption effect and add a constant retardation factor in the transport equation for the leachate in soils an analytical solution for describing the spatiotemporal distribution of leachate concentration in the unsaturated soil liner is then developed a finite difference model developed for leachate transport in unsaturated soils and chen et al s 2019 solution are employed to check the validities of using the hydrostatic equilibrium condition constant retardation factor and robin type condition this new solution is then used to evaluate the effect of the retardation factor on the leachate migration moreover a sensitivity analysis with the help of differential importance measure is performed to assess the effect of each of the model variables and parameters on the leachate concentration finally the present solution is applied to estimate the transport parameters for data obtained from laboratory experiments in a chamber with composite liners conducted by park et al 2012 2 method fig 1 is the schematic diagram to illustrate the leachate migration through a gm to the underlying natural soil liner the origin of the coordinate system is at the bottom of the gm with a positive axis downward the 1 d transport equations in the gm and soil liner can be respectively expressed as bear 1979 chen et al 2019 1a r g c g t d g 2 c g z 2 l g z 0 and 1b r u θ c u t z d u c u z 0 z l u where the subscripts g and u denote the gm and underlying soils respectively c m l3 is the leachate concentration r is the retardation factor representing a measure of the amount of contaminant slowed due to the sorption effect mojid and vereecken 2005 d l2 t is the diffusion coefficient note that d u l2 t can be expressed as d u d u θ where d u l2 t is the effective diffusion coefficient defined as τ d 0 with tortuosity τ and aqueous diffusion coefficient d 0 l2 t t t is the elapsed time z l is the depth from the bottom of the gm liner θ is the water content which varies with depth and the variables l l is the associated thickness consider the flow system is clean initially the initial condition for the leachate concentration in both gm and soils is therefore expressed as 2 c g c u 0 t 0 the gm liner is usually made of nonporous polymers with randomly distributed voids park and nibras 1993 the migration of the leachate through the gm is mainly affected by the processes of partition and diffusion at the top of the gm the leachate may be considered to maintain a constant concentration denoted as c 0 m l3 the associated condition is written as 3 c g s g c 0 z l g where s g is the partition coefficient defined as the ratio of the concentration in the gm to that in the leachate at equilibrium park and bontoux 1991 park and nibras 1993 foose 2002 chen et al 2019 chen et al 2019 considered that the underlying soil is of finite extent in their model and with a zero concentration condition or no flux condition at the bottom the natural soil liner however is about three orders of magnitude thicker than the gm one might expect that the effect of the bottom boundary condition on the leachate distribution is minor the natural soil liner is therefore viewed as semi infinite extent chen et al 2015 feng et al 2019 the no flux condition at the remote boundary is expressed as 4 c u z 0 z at the interface between the gm and soil liner the following conditions are required 5a c g s g c u z 0 and 5b d g c g z d u θ c u z z 0 the partition coefficients between the gm liner and leachate and between the gm and underlying soil liner may be different however for the sake of simplicity both are assumed the same see e g foose 2002 chen et al 2009 xie et al 2015b and equal to s g 2 1 derivation of robin type condition for gm the diffusive flux j mt 1l 2 of contaminants through the gm may be described by fick s first law written as 6 j d g c g z the gm liner is quite thin compared with the soil liner therefore the numerator on the right hand side rhs of eq 6 may be expressed as the concentration difference between the top and the bottom of the gm hence the rhs term of eq 6 may be approximated as 7 d g c g z d g c g z 0 c g z l g l g on the basis of eqs 3 5a and 5b the flux through the gm to the underlying soils becomes 8 d u θ c u z d g s g c u s g c 0 l g z 0 which is a robin type condition or the third type condition in mathematics it can reduce to the dirichlet boundary condition if d g d u or neumann boundary condition if d g d u the former means that d g is very large resulting in a fixed leachate concentration at the interface between the gm and soil surface on the other hand the latter implies that d g is very small so that the gm liner becomes an impermeable layer however the d g is generally smaller than the d u thus eq 8 would not become the dirichlet type condition in reality 2 2 transport model and analytical solution according to the gardner 1958 model θ can be expressed as 9a θ θ r θ s θ r e β ψ where θ r and θ s are respectively the residual and saturated water contents β l 1 is the unsaturated exponent related to the pore size distribution of the soils ψ l is the pressure head note that the gardner 1958 model is commonly used to derive analytical solutions of unsaturated flow but is not flexible to provide accurate descriptions of real world problems as compared with the van genuchten mualem equation used in the numerical models mentioned in ghezzehei et al 2007 the hydraulic head h l in the soils is defined as the sum of the pressure head and elevation head denoted as l u z then h ψ l u z if the flow in the unsaturated soil liner is under hydrostatic equilibrium h in the soils keeps as zero tartakovsky and neuman 2007 resulting in ψ z l u further considering θ r is small and negligible eq 9a becomes 9b θ θ s e β z l u for a linear sorption the retardation factor r u is denoted as 1 ρ κ θ with bulk density ρ ml 3 and solid water partition coefficient κ l3m 1 in this study the r u is assumed as a constant and expressed as 1 ρ κ θ s because the change in water content is small mentioned in section 3 1 based on the comparison of the predicted results from the present solution and numerical model then eqs 1b and 8 can be respectively expressed as 10 r u c u t d u 2 c u z 2 β c u z 0 z l u and 11 d u θ s e β l u c u z d g s g c u s g c 0 l g z 0 on the basis of kumar et al s 2012 work in modelling near subsurface temperature eq 10 with conditions 2 4 and 11 has a solution expressed as 12a c u

discussion in the following study the default values for the parameters or variables such as c 0 s g d u d g θ s and l g are 1 10 4 kg m3 0 032 3 4 10 10 m2 s 6 10 13 m2 s 0 35 and 1 5 10 3 m respectively adopted from chen et al s 2019 work the retardation factor r u is calculated by assuming that ρ 1330 kg m3 and κ 7 5 10 5 m3 kg hence the r u is obtained as 1 1330 7 5 10 5 0 35 which equals 1 285 in addition we assume that l u 1 5 m and β 0 05 m 1 3 1 comparison with finite difference solution the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium in the soil liner may not be held for flowing pore water we herein develop an explicit finite difference method written in python programming language for describing contaminant transport and transient water flow models in soils the flow equation for describing the hydraulic head h in the soils is denoted as 15 θ t z k u k h z 0 z l u where k is the relative permeability which can be described by the gardner 1958 model as e β h z l u k u l t is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil liner and set as 1 10 9 m s the initial condition for the soils is given as 16 h 0 t 0 the boundary conditions specified at the top and bottom of the soil liner are respectively 17 k u k h z k g h h 0 l g z 0 and 18 h 0 z l u where h 0 l is the hydraulic head at the top of the gm and set as 0 3 m according to the federal u s environmental protection agency guide federal register 2000 k g is the hydraulic conductivity of the gm and set as 1 16 10 14 m s the finite difference grids along the z direction are set as z i i δ z for i 0 1 n z where n z is the total number of spatial nodes and δ z is the grid size equal to l u n z the simulation time is chosen as t j j δ t for j 0 1 n t in which n t is the total number of time intervals δ t is the time interval equal to t n t with the total simulation time t using the first order forward euler approximation eq 15 can be approximated as langtangen and linge 2017 19a h i j 1 h i j δ t k u

initial condition for leachate concentration in the soil liner eq 2 is approximated as 24 c u i 0 0 w i t h i 0 1 n z the top boundary condition eq 8 can be expressed as 25 c u 0 j δ z c 0 d g s g c u 1 j d u l g e β h 1 j l u δ z d g s g d u l g e β h 1 j l u the lower boundary specified as no flux condition eq 4 can be written as 26 c n z j c n z 1 j moreover the stability criterions for the flow equation eq 19a and transport equation eq 23a should be respectively fulfilled as langtangen and linge 2017 27a δ t δ z 2 2 m a x k u k where m a x k u k gives k u e β h 0 and 27b δ t δ z 2 2 m a x d

θ r is 0 1 fig 2 shows the spatial distributions of c u c peak and θ predicted by the present solution and finite difference solution and their difference in c u c peak note that c peak is the peak concentration in soils the lower right panel indicates that θ predicted by the finite difference solution seems to be independent of time it may be attributed to the problem that the hydraulic conductivity of the gm is so small that the flow in the soils is negligible the θ used in the present solution deviates from that of the finite difference solution due to the neglect of θ r however the c u c peak distributions predicted by both solutions are in good agreement the largest difference in the concentrations predicted from both solutions is less than 0 008 indicating that the largest difference of 0 007 in the water content predicted by the gardner model doesn t have a significant effect on the concentration prediction therefore assuming the flow in the soils under hydrostatic equilibrium and the constant retardation factor are practically acceptable 3 2 comparison with chen et al s 2019 solution the numerical evaluation for chen et al s 2019 solution may rely on two steps as discussed in detail in appendix a one of the steps involves root finding procedure while the other is to draw a figure to determine the number of terms required to the infinite sum in the solution for the desired accuracy due to its complexity and laborious work the laplace domain solution given in chen et al 2019 eq 17b is used and evaluated using the laplace inversion scheme proposed by stehfest 1970 in the following analysis notice that the present solution eq 12a in terms of the complementary error function is very easy to evaluate especially using the software such as matlab or mathematica fig 3 shows the spatial distribution curves of c u c peak predicted by the present and chen et al s 2019 solutions for the unsaturated exponent β varying from 0 05 m 1 to 5 m 1 at t 10 years the curves predicted by both solutions indicate good agreement for various β s the curves predicted by the present solution slightly deviate from that by chen et al s 2019 solution when z is close to 1 5 m however such a difference is quite small and negligible the results in fig 3 indicate that the robin type boundary condition can also give a good prediction for the migration of the leachate in the gm 3 3 effect of the retardation factor on leachate migration landfill leachate generally has a variety of organic contaminants jiménez et al 2002 the sorption behavior of organic compounds in soils is widely recognized and investigated e g calvet 1989 breus and mishchenko 2006 bronner and goss 2010 the value of the retardation factor larger than unit i e r u 1 indicates the sorption effect making the leachate migration slow on the other hand r u 1 suggests there is no sorption effect on the leachate migration chen et al s 2019 solution only considers the case of r u 1 and thus cannot reflect the sorption effect for organic chemicals on the leachate migration in the soils fig 4 demonstrates the spatial distribution curves of c u c peak predicted by the present solution and chen et al s 2019 solution for the r u varying from 1 to 2 at t 10 years one can observe that the present solution and chen et al s 2019 solution match fairly well for the case r u 1 the concentration curve predicted by the present solution decreases with increasing r u indicating that a larger r u represents a greater sorption effect thereby the contaminant in the leachate migrates a shorter distance these results indicate the limitation of chen et al s 2019 solution in predicting the leachate migration if the sorption effect in the soils is significant in fact their solution can include the sorption effect simply by adding a constant retardation factor in the model 3 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa is a powerful tool to evaluate the effects of various parameters on the model output the normalized sensitivity coefficient is defined as the partial derivative of the model dependent variable for a specific parameter 29a x k p k c p k p k where x k indicates the sensitivity of c u to the k th input parameter p k eq 29a may be approximated by a finite difference formula denoted as liou and yeh 1997 i e 29b x k p k c p k δ p k c p k δ p k where δ p k is chosen as 10 3 p k borgonovo and apostolakis 2001 introduced a relatively new measure of sa called differential importance measure which is widely applied in the area of risk management for decision making borgonovo et al 2003 vinod et al 2003 marseguerra and zio 2004 this measure is defined as 30a dim k δ p k p k p k j 1 n δ p j c p j p j where dim k is the differential importance measure of parameter p k and n is the total number of the model parameters according to eq 29a eq 30a can be written as 30b dim k x k j 1 n x j since x k may be negative the absolute value is taken for it and eq 30b is then expressed as 30c dim k x k j 1 n x j there are eight parameters and variables in total are considered in the sa fig 5 demonstrates the temporal distribution curves for a x k and b dim k observed at z d 0 1 note that a positive x k indicates the increase of a specific parameter or variable leading to an increase in c u contrarily a negative x k implies that an increase in the parameter results in a decrease in c u fig 5 a shows that the effects of the changes in parameters s g d g l g and θ s on the leachate transport increase with time and their effects are relatively larger than the other four parameters at large times on the other hand the effects of the changes in β and l u are small all the time from another perspective the measure dim k provides a good indication for the parameter effect in this case as shown in fig 5 b the dim k curves for the parameters d g l g θ s and d u exhibits rapid changes at time 5 77 days before that time the parameter r u produces the largest effect followed by s g d g l g θ s d u l u and β one can observe that s g d g l g and θ s exert similar effects while l u and β give the same influence on the leachate migration after 5 77 days s g becomes the most sensitive parameter followed by d g l g θ s r u d u l u and β it is because that the s g directly affects the leachate concentration in the gm which is in touch with the soil liner landfills often operate for several decades these results indicate that the parameters associated with the gm and embedded in the robin boundary condition play a dominant role for the leachate migration in the soils 3 5 bench scale composite liner experiment and data analysis park et al 2012 conducted bench scale composite liner experiments comprising a high density polyethylene gm overlying a compacted clay liner the thicknesses of the gm and clay liners were respectively 1 5 10 3 m and 0 12 m five species of vocs i e dichloromethane dcm methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe trichloroethylene tce toluene tol and chlorobenzene cbzh with constant concentration c 0 0 1 kg m3 were filled on the top of gm and measured their concentration at the depths of 0 06 m and 0 09 m below the gm the transport parameters estimated from other tests were used as inputs for foose et al s 2002 finite difference solution and rowe et al s 1983 semi analytical solution to predict the concentration distributions which indicated that the predictions by both solutions are the same they analyzed the concentration data from kinetic batch tests using crank s 1975 analytical solution coupled with the nonlinear least squares method to estimate s g and d g associated with the gm for each voc in addition the values of r u for vocs were determined based on equilibrium batch isotherm tests and linear least square regression the variation among three replicates for those five species measured at 0 06 m seems to be large therefore only the datasets measured at 0 09 m from their replicate 2 are analyzed in this study further these datasets are read from park et al 2012 fig 7 using the webplotdigitizer rohatgi 2018 the present solution is coupled with the levenberg marquardt algorithm given in the mathematica routine nonlinearmodelfit wolfram research inc 2018 to analyze the data and estimate the transport parameters values the standard error of estimate see and mean error me given by yeh 1987 are used to assess the prediction errors table 1 lists estimated parameters and associated prediction errors by the present solution and those used in park et al s 2012 work it is not surprising that the values of see and me of the present solution are much smaller than those given by park et al s 2012 work due to the use of β and the transport parameters for the gm and clay adopted from batch tests the parameters r u s g d u and d g estimated from the present solution and park et al 2012 are roughly on the same order of magnitude the β estimated from the present solution ranges from 0 007 m 1 to 0 03 m 1 which is reasonable for the moist clay liner used in the experiments acharya et al 2012 fig 6 shows the measured concentrations of dcm mtbe tce tol and cbzh represented by empty circles and the temporal concentration distributions predicted by the present solution with estimated parameters listed in table 1 and park et al s 2012 prediction read from their work the figure shows good fits for the predictions from the present solution to the measured data indicating that the present solution can be used to estimate the transport parameters without conducting additional batch tests as did in park et al 2012 4 concluding remarks this study presents an analytical model for describing leachate concentration distribution in unsaturated soil liner due to diffusion through a gm the top of the soil liner is specified under a robin type boundary condition developed based on fick s first law the gardner 1958 model is adopted to depict the soil water content profile with the assumption that the pressure head is under hydrostatic equilibrium compared with chen et al s 2019 solution the present solution is much simpler to evaluate while the retardation factor is also considered to reflect the sorption effect on the leachate migration the applicability of the present solution in estimating the transport parameters is demonstrated in the case of analyzing the measured data from bench scale composite liner experiments the major findings from this study are summarized below 1 a finite difference solution for describing contaminant transport and transient water flow is also developed to check the prediction accuracy of the present solution the results indicate that the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in the soil liner and the use of constant retardation factor are reasonable because the permeability of gm is extremely low 2 the concentrations predicted by the present solution and chen et al s 2019 solution show good

since μ m is the unknown in rb m one must determine it from the nonlinear equation eq a2a which unfortunately is impossible to solve analytically therefore a plot for f μ versus μ shown in fig a1 is drawn to observe the curve of f μ and explore the locations of its roots in the first step the figure indicates that the first two roots are roughly at 1 2 and 3 2 and the succeeding roots are located with a uniform interval of about 2 0 then a root finding algorithm such as newton s method yeh 1987 can be employed to determine the exact locations of all the roots that is μ m m 1 2 the second rht of eq a1a has an infinite sum thus one must decide the number of the term used to represent the infinite sum for the desired accuracy of the estimated leachate concentration in the second step fig a2 is plotted to show the value of rb m versus m for z 0 1 m near the bottom of the gm and 14 9 m near the bottom of the unsaturated zone at t 1 day small time and 1 year large time the figure indicates that rb m converges rapidly for large t and slowly for small t the figure also indicates that the number of terms required to calculate rb m with an accuracy to the sixth decimal is about 112 for the small time case and 11 for the large time case 
5481,in this study a recurrent neural network rnn was used to perform statistical downscaling and its advantages were showed compared to the traditional artificial neural network ann the hydrological response to the downscaled meteorological data was evaluated using the soil and water assessment tool swat model the results indicated that the temperature downscaled in southeastern china was better than that in northwestern china while precipitation was the opposite although rnn and ann model had different feasibility in different regions of china the performance of rnn model for maximum and minimum temperature downscaling was about 6 and 10 better than that of ann model overall respectively and rnn model was better for extreme temperature conditions simulation regarding precipitation the performance of rnn and ann model was similar when simulating precipitation amount however the use of rnn model improved the prediction accuracy of dry and wet days in order to improve the accuracy of extreme precipitation downscaling a new model rnn randextreme was proposed compared with the ann and single rnn model rnn randextreme model improved the prediction accuracy of extreme precipitation by 28 32 and 16 56 respectively the hydrological simulation results of swat model showed that the rnn and rnn randextreme model significantly improved the accuracy of hydrological simulations of flow and evapotranspiration compared to the ann model however as the time scale became rougher from daily to annual scale the improvement effect of rnn and rnn randextreme model would weaken the results of this study may help improving the accuracy of statistical downscaling and support choosing downscaling models in different areas keywords climate change statistical downscaling recurrent neural network hydrological response swat model 1 introduction climate change related issues have recently been the focus of many studies lesk et al 2016 tokarska and gillett 2018 an increasing number of studies are focusing on the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle hattermann et al 2017 kour et al 2016 vetter et al 2017 as climate change will provoke the reallocation of water resources which will ultimately lead to water contamination problems and pose a threat to human lives piao et al 2010 whitehead et al 2009 the results of studies to date have shown that of all meteorological variables precipitation and temperature changes have the most significant impacts on the hydrological cycle chitra tarak et al 2018 tao and barros 2018 watts et al 2015 as they can influence the process of runoff and evapotranspiration that can lead to floods and droughts globally arnell and gosling 2016 oliver et al 2015 most of these studies have used hydrological models as their base tool to study hydrological responses to climate change abbaspour et al 2015 arnold 1994 gashaw et al 2018 to accurately represent the spatial heterogeneity of hydrology these models require high resolution precipitation and temperature data to evaluate the future impacts of climate change on the hydrological processes in models global climate models gcms have been widely used to acquire climate change data under different scenarios cho et al 2016 li et al 2017 however the spatial resolution of gcms are too low for hydrological models to perform accurate hydrological modeling xu 1999 as a result downscaling is required to obtain future meteorological data with an adequately high spatial resolution and this is conducted by establishing relationships between large scale atmosphere circulation factors and small scale meteorological data chen et al 2012 dynamical and statistical downscaling are the two main methods employed in the downscaling process yhang et al 2017 compared to dynamical downscaling statistical downscaling is time saving and can be applied to large areas hidalgo et al 2008 widmann et al 2003 and thus it is the main method currently used in climate change studies to acquire meteorological data with a high resolution especially over relatively large areas bajracharya et al 2018 snyder et al 2019 regression is a key method used in statistical downscaling as it establishes the relationship between large scale atmosphere circulation factors and small scale meteorological data based on historical data ghosh and mujumdar 2008 however to acquire highly accurate future meteorological data it is necessary to research methods that can improve the performance of regression in statistical downscaling the statistical downscaling methods currently used mainly include the transfer function method weather pattern method and the stochastic weather generator method kioutsioukis et al 2008 in the past linear regression methods were often used to establish the relationship between atmosphere circulation factors and meteorological variables huth 2002 zorita and von storch 1999 however this relationship is often complex and non linear which means it is difficult for linear regression to achieve satisfying downscaling results ghosh and mujumdar 2008 as a result machine learning methods are currently used in statistical downscaling research as they can effectively represent non linear relationships chaudhary et al 2019 yi et al 2018 however almost all these methods only consider the spatial relationship between predictors and predictants but they ignore the temporal continuity of meteorological data sachindra et al 2018 tomozeiu et al 2018 meteorological data are a type of serial data that have temporal correlation characteristics merino et al 2018 nam et al 2016 zaytar and el amrani 2016 and ignoring such temporal continuity causes errors and provides inaccurate downscaling results maqsood et al 2003 zaytar and el amrani 2016 therefore with respect to machine learning methods it is necessary to further study the temporal continuity of statistical downscaling methods to improve the downscaling accuracy the impacts of extreme precipitation on the environment are significant and cannot be ignored in climate change research as extreme precipitation can cause floods soil erosion and lead to serious water contamination carpenter et al 2018 eekhout et al 2018 raghavendra et al 2018 however unlike normal precipitation the occurrence of extreme precipitation is random and uncertain which is difficult to predict lee et al 2017 accurately simulating extreme precipitation is also difficult and many downscaling studies have been conducted to determine a method that enables better prediction of extreme precipitation castellano and degaetano 2016 it has been shown that extreme precipitation can be simulated by referring to historical characteristics castellano and degaetano 2016 thus considering the historical distribution in machine learning methods can improve the simulation accuracy of extreme precipitation events in the statistical downscaling process in this study the machine learning method known as the recurrent neural network rnn was used to conduct downscaling of precipitation and temperature in china in addition the rnn randextreme method which couples the rnn and random generation method was proposed to improve the simulation accuracy of extreme precipitation in the downscaling process the impacts of the temperature and precipitation downscaling accuracy on hydrological processes were then further analyzed based on the soil and water assessment tool swat model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area statistical downscaling was implemented for all the national weather stations in china fig 1 and the weihe upstream watershed in the yellow river basin was chosen as a focus to analyze the impacts of using different statistical downscaling methods on hydrological simulation results the weihe upstream watershed is located within a temperate monsoon climate zone and it experiences high temperature and rain in summer and cold dry weather in winter there are obvious differences in the temperature and precipitation amounts between the four seasons in addition it is known that the hydrological processes in weihe upstream watershed have been significantly affected by climate change zhao et al 2019 2 2 statistical downscaling methods two types of machine learning methods were used as the statistical downscaling methods the traditional artificial neural network ann and the recurrent neural network rnn the ann is a mathematical model that can imitate the thought processes of the human brain and as it can deal with nonlinear problems it has been widely used to process classification and regression issues in many disciplines lecun et al 2015 a multilayer perceptron mlp model was proved to be effective in statistical downscaling yang et al 2018 usually a three layer mlp is enough for downscaling but there is no specific criteria to determine the structure of mlp nam do et al 2011 ahmed et al 2015 the recurrent neural network rnn is an artificial neural network that was developed to extract characteristics in sequential data and predict future trends rumerlhar 1986 compared to the normal ann the rnn can learn and remember information from the past and use it as a state variable to be passed into the next time step graves et al 2013 in this way the characteristics of time series data can be learned and represented the long short term memory lstm model is one of the most widely used rnns and it overcomes the vanishing gradient problem of the original rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the lstm has been widely used in natural language processing nlp and machine translation li et al 2018 xie et al 2019 however few studies considered the time series characteristics and used rnn as statistical downscaling model meteorological data have time series characteristics that could be suitable for being downscaled by the lstm model it is difficult to downscale extreme precipitation because it occurs randomly and the relationship between extreme precipitation and predictor variables are different from that between ordinary rainfall and predictor variables liu et al 2013 this study thus proposes a modified method for generating extreme precipitation called the rnn randextreme in the first step of this model s operation historical extreme precipitation is analyzed to achieve the extreme precipitation threshold value and the extreme precipitation events and amounts in each month for each station in the second step when predicting the rainfall if the simulated rainfall is larger than the rainfall threshold a random selection is then conducted using the extreme precipitation probability statistical information obtained in the first step however if simulated rainfall is larger than the threshold but no extreme precipitation occurred in the historical period the rainfall is assigned a value equal to the threshold in this way extreme precipitation is identified by the rnn model but it is generated by random selection from the historical statistical information of extreme precipitation events the performance of ann and rnn with different structures was analyzed first to find out the optimum model and structure six structures were built up with different numbers of hidden layers and neurons 1 hidden layer and 50 neurons 1 layer and 100 neurons 2 layers and 50 neurons 2 layers and 100 neurons 3 layers and 50 neurons 3 layers and 100 neurons the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate the performance of ann and rnn with different structures on downscaling temperature and the rmse and dry wet day prediction accuracy dwa were used to evaluate that of precipitation the equations of these indices are listed as follows eqs 1 4 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 2 nse i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 4 dwa dc dn where o i is the ith observed data o is the mean value of the observed data p i is the predicted data p is the mean value of the predicted data n is the total count of sample pairs dc is the number of days on which whether it had rain is correctly predicted and dn is the total number of days on which rainfall is predicted 2 3 hydrological response analysis methods the soil and water assessment tool swat model was employed as the hydrological model to analyze the response of the hydrological simulation to the downscaling results swat is a watershed scale time continuous model that was developed by the united states department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars arnold et al 1998 and it was designed to simulate hydrological processes and water quality variation on a watershed scale after decades of development the swat has learned from the successful experiences of other models and it has become one of the most widely used hydrological and water quality simulation models the swat model simulates the hydrological cycle based on the water balance equation eq 5 5 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where s w t is the final soil moisture s w 0 is the initial soil moisture on day i r day is the rainfall amount on day i q surf is the surface runoff on day i e a is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i w seep is the amount of water transferred from the soil profile into the gas zone on day i and q gw is the return flow on day i meteorological data were the most important data used in driving the swat model and they have a considerable impact on simulation results such data included precipitation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed four meteorological input scenarios were established the observed meteorological data were used first as a baseline scenario and precipitation and temperature inputs were then replaced using the downscaled results of the ann rnn and rnn randextreme methods these four swat models were run independently and the outputs of stream flow and evapotranspiration at the outlet channel of the watershed were compared 2 4 data collection the daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation observation data from 1979 to 2017 were obtained from the national meteorological information center data cma cn these data were preprocessed and stations that provided no observation data were excluded after the pretreatment process 573 stations were selected for temperature and 591 stations for precipitation fig 1 and the observed data were used as the predictants in the statistical downscaling process to specifically analyze the temporal simulation characteristics of the ann and rnn stations located within the weihe upstream watershed boundary were selected four stations 52 986 57 014 57 025 and 57 034 were chosen to conduct the temperature analysis and four stations 53 903 56 093 57 014 and 57 028 were chosen to conduct the precipitation analysis different stations were chosen to represent temperature and precipitation as it was difficult to find one station that had a full record of both temperature and precipitation data the national centers for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis dataset was used to provide the predictor variables in the statistical downscaling process www ncep noaa gov and 13 and 19 predictor variables were selected for temperature and precipitation downscaling respectively table 1 all predictor variables were standardized prior to use to eliminate the impact of different dimensions and orders of magnitude on the downscaling results the observation and reanalysis data were divided into train data 1979 2016 and test data 2017 digital elevation model dem data were obtained from the geospatial data cloud www gscloud cn at a resolution of 30 m land use data from 2015 were interpreted from landsat 8 remote sensing image data at a resolution of 30 m soil data at a resolution of 30 m were obtained from the institute of geography at the chinese academy of sciences and all these data were used to build the swat model and to subsequently simulate the hydrological response to the downscaled meteorological data 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance and uncertainty analysis for ann and rnn model overall rnn had obvious better performance than ann model for maximum temperature one hidden layer and 50 neurons was the best structure for both ann and rnn model and the performance of ann and rnn was similar table 2 for minimum temperature rnn models with all structures were better than the ann model except with the three hidden layer and 100 neurons structure rnn with two hidden layers and 100 neurons showed the best performance among all the models for precipitation it was apparent that rnn model was better than ann model table 3 the rnn with one hidden layer and 100 neurons provided the best performance among all rnn structures the average dwa of the best rnn structure was more than 30 higher than the worst rnn structure what s more it could be found that the performance of model didn t always become better with the increase of model complexity especially for ann model ann with the simplest structure even showed the best performance the performance of rnn model also diminished when three layers were employed all the predictants only required the use of rnn with one hidden layer to get the best performance except the minimum temperature however the performance of rnn was improved with an increase in the neuron counts from 50 to 100 when the number of layers was fixed the best structures for ann and rnn model were used to perform following analysis the continuity of meteorological variables is very important and it cannot be ignored in statistical downscaling rnn has a complex structure that takes into consideration time series characteristics overcoming the inherent defect of ann model wang and wu 1998 when a network has a larger number of layers and hidden neurons it is able to use more information and can learn more from the input data lyu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 but the complex model structure requires large amounts of training data lecun et al 2015 and some studies have found no increase in the performance of the neural network with a great increase in its complexity and the performance has even been found to deteriorate he et al 2016 zhang et al 1998 therefore to use the rnn model to conduct statistical downscaling it is necessary to determine an appropriate rnn structure first liu 2019 3 2 spatial variation analysis of downscaling results the spatial patterns of maximum and minimum temperature downscaled by ann and rnn were both similar to those of the observed data fig 2 a c and the spatial distributions of the rmse showed similar variations for both among the different regions fig 2d e the southeastern coastal areas had smaller rmse values than the northwest inland areas however compared to the ann the temperature of the rnn was closer to the observed data for maximum temperature downscaling the rnn provided no apparent advantages over the ann with the same nse and r2 values and rmse differences no greater than 1 table 2 for minimum temperature rnn provided a relatively better performance than ann all the indicators were better than ann and the rmse was improved by up to 8 the ann and rnn provided different feasibilities in different areas of china compared to the rnn the ann provided lower rmse values for maximum temperature in most areas of china except in the northwestern areas fig 2f however this difference was not obvious and the rmse values of both ann and rnn were smaller than 2 c however the rnn provided better simulation results in the northwest of china with rmse values up to 6 smaller than those of the ann different from the downscaling results of maximum temperature the rnn was more suitable than ann in most area of china for downscaling minimum temperature with rmse values that were approximately 10 smaller for precipitation the downscaling results of the ann and rnn showed similar spatial distributions fig 3 a the rmse distribution for both the ann and rnn showed that the downscaling performance of precipitation was better in the northwest than in the southeast fig 3b the rmse value was lower than 5 mm in the northwest but larger than 10 mm in the southeast of china a comparison between the rnn and ann showed that the ann had smaller rmse values in most of china but this difference was not obvious and was less than 0 5 mm however the rnn showed a better capacity for predicting whether rain occurred on one day and the dwa value was 1 5 higher than that of the ann table 3 similar to the rmse the spatial distributions of the dwa for the ann and rnn were better in northwest china than in southeast china with an increase in dwa values of more than 20 fig 3c however the dwa values were higher for the rnn than the ann over a larger area in northwest china a comparison between the dwa of the ann and rnn showed that the rnn performed better at predicting dry wet days for most of china for temperature the rnn model was unable to improve the downscaling performance in all areas use of the ann may be adequate for downscaling temperature in southeast china especially for maximum temperature however in the northwest of china the rnn efficiently improved the downscaling results compared to the ann the temperate continental climate is the dominant climate zone in northwest china and it has large temperature variations that make the periodic fluctuation of temperature more obvious than other areas mogi et al 2017 extreme temperature occurs in the lowlands in northwest china with respect to topography climate zone characteristics and other complex factors which means that temperature is not only affected by intraday atmosphere conditions but also previous conditions huang et al 2010 thus the use of the ann could not provide satisfactory results because it ignores the impact of previous temperature characteristics on intraday temperature whereas time series characteristics and continuity are better considered in the rnn salman et al 2015 therefore temporal fluctuations of temperature are better represented and the previous meteorological condition is better considered in the rnn which helps to improve the accuracy of statistical downscaling compared to the temperature downscaling results using the ann may be better than the rnn for simulating the precipitation amount this could be because the precipitation amount has more random and uncertain than temperature wang et al 2017 which meant that series continuity is weak therefore the rnn may not determine the series characteristics of the precipitation amount or it may even determine the wrong series characteristics the dwa results indicated that the rnn is significantly better than the ann at determining whether rain will occur on a particular day this result could relate to the time series characteristics of the dry and wet day distribution that can be simulated in a traditional way using the markov chain method delleur et al 1989 sonnadara and jayewardene 2015 in addition the rnn can learn from previous days and use comprehensive information to conduct the prediction which cannot be realized by the ann wilby et al 1998 accurately simulating dry and wet days distribution is important for representing the impacts of climate change on hydrological processes faramarzi et al 2013 3 3 temporal analysis of downscaling results for temperature the times series analysis of the four stations in the weihe upstream watershed showed that the rae of both ann and rnn in all the seasons except winter was approximately 20 in winter the rae reached more than 1000 fig 4 a comparison between the time series of ann and rnn for maximum temperature showed that they had almost the same prediction capacity for these four stations with similar values of r2 nse and rmse table 4 however for minimum temperature the rnn showed better indices values for all four stations than ann and the rmse was improved by up to 10 there were no apparent differences between the downscaled daily maximum temperature results of ann and rnn methods fig 4a but the rnn showed a better performance than the ann for minimum temperature with a smaller rae especially in winter with a rae that was one times smaller on average fig 4b the results of monthly average maximum and minimum temperature show that the rnn could achieve results closer to the observed data than the ann especially in summer for maximum temperature and in winter for minimum temperature with up to 1 c fig 5 for precipitation the temporal analysis results showed that the rnn provided better accuracy in predicting whether rain had occurred on a particular day with a dwa higher than that of ann of up to more than 7 on average and the annual rainfall results indicated that the rnn randextreme method obtained closer predicted results to the observed data than the rnn method with a percentage decrease in the underestimation from 36 34 to 28 80 on average table 5 for monthly rainfall the rnn randextreme method improved the rnn results in summer with a percentage reduction in the underestimated amount of precipitation ranging from 0 4 to 10 7 between all four stations fig 6 a with respect to extreme precipitation the results showed that the rnn method performed evidently better than the ann method with the underestimate percentage of extreme precipitation decreased from 66 87 to 57 44 and rnn randextreme method further improved the performance of the rnn with underestimate percentage decreased to 47 93 table 5 furthermore more than 50 of extreme precipitation events were better simulated using the rnn randextreme than using the ann fig 6b the weihe upstream watershed lies within the temperate monsoon climate zone it is relatively difficult to downscale the extreme temperature fluctuations in winter and summer using normal methods coulibaly 2004 fan et al 2013 however the better performance of the rnn for maximum temperature downscaled in summer and minimum temperature downscaled in winter shows that extreme temperature conditions are better simulated using the rnn than the ann this is because rnn considers the past time series and it can effectively learn the fluctuation tendency of extreme temperature arslan and sekertekin 2019 extreme temperature condition variations are the main contributor to changes in hydrological processes manfreda et al 2018 therefore better simulations of extreme temperature need to be employed to more accurately represent the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle chen et al 2019 the temporal analysis of the precipitation downscaling results showed that ann also provided satisfactory accuracy when the required outputs were on an annual scale this is likely related to the daily errors being averaged on an annual scale where the temporal variation characteristics of meteorological data are not reflected shao et al 2019 however the rnn and rnn randextreme methods are more suitable for use than the ann when either daily or monthly scaled outputs are required because compared to the annual scale the temporal variation characteristics of meteorological data are obvious on daily and monthly scales zerenner et al 2018 extreme conditions of precipitation are extremely difficult to simulate souvignet and heinrich 2011 and precipitation errors mainly relate to underestimations of extreme precipitation events instead of non extreme precipitation gutmann et al 2014 haylock et al 2006 simulating extreme precipitation accurately is key to improving the performance of hydrological models zhu et al 2019 to enable the performance of downscaling methods to be ascertained it was thus extremely important to determine whether accurate predictions of extreme precipitation could be made castellano and degaetano 2017 the ann underestimated extreme precipitation more seriously than the rnn but this underestimation was offset by overestimating non extreme precipitation and miscalculation of no rain days to rain days compared to the rnn the rnn randextreme method overcame the problem of underestimating extreme precipitation in the rnn method which occurred due to the high randomness and uncertainty of extreme precipitation wang et al 2019 it has been determined that extreme precipitation has historical analogous characteristics in certain areas dang et al 2019 and it can thus be effectively predicted based on historical distribution using the analogy method castellano and degaetano 2016 3 4 hydrological response to statistical downscaling results the flow simulation results of swat model showed that the rnn and rnn randextreme methods provided superior performances to the ann method the results of daily flow out showed that the rnn and rnn randextreme methods performed better than the ann method in the wet season with rae values that were approximately 10 smaller fig 7 a the rnn randextreme method helps to improve the simulation accuracy of the rnn method especially during the extinction period of flow with an improvement of approximately 25 the monthly averaged flow out results of swat model indicate that the rnn randextreme method provided the best simulation effect of all models with better flow simulation results in seven out of the twelve months the effect was particularly enhanced in summer when the flow was large the annual averaged results of simulated flow of swat model showed that the use of all the three methods underestimated flow but the use of the ann and rnn randextreme methods were obviously better than rnn method with an improvement of about 25 the daily evapotranspiration outputs of swat model indicated that the rnn and rnn randextreme methods significantly improved the simulation accuracy compared to the ann method with rae values smaller than 10 for rnn and rnn randextreme the values for ann were larger than 40 fig 7b the simulated results of swat model for monthly averaged evapotranspiration showed that the rnn and rnn randextreme methods provided better simulated results than the ann in most months with an average improvement of up to 7 the rnn and rnn randextreme methods were also relatively better than the ann method for simulating annual evapotranspiration with comparative improvements of up to 5 however there were no obvious differences between the rnn and rnn randextreme methods in all time scales the flow out and evapotranspiration process are affected by variations in both the precipitation process and temperature zhang et al 2015 the performance relating to amounts of simulated flow and evapotranspiration was improved using the rnn and rnn randextreme methods compared to the ann because the accuracy of temperature and precipitation inputs were increased in particular the high flow condition and extinction period in the flow simulation were better simulated using the rnn randextreme method because extreme precipitation is better estimated by the rnn randextreme method and this directly affected the high flow simulation the accurate high flow simulation results of water transport further improved the simulation accuracy during the extinction process however when the temporal scale became coarser from a daily to an annual scale the improvement effects of the rnn and rnn randextreme weakened and the ann provided better results for flow than the rnn on an annual scale it is considered that this result relates to the overestimation of non extreme precipitation by the ann which coincidentally offset the extreme precipitation underestimation 4 conclusions based on the use of machine learning and big data a time series based rnn method was used to evaluate its ability to downscale temperature and precipitation for precipitation downscaling a new method that coupled the rnn with random extreme precipitation was proposed and this improved consideration of the high uncertainty and randomness of extreme precipitation the spatial analysis results showed that for temperature downscaling stations in the southeast of china were better downscaled than those in the northwest in addition the rnn performed better than the ann throughout most of china when downscaling minimum temperature for maximum temperature the rnn significantly improved the downscaling performance in the northwest of china where temperature variations are large for precipitation downscaling was more effectively applied in the northwest than in the southeast of china furthermore the rnn performed better with dry wet day predictions than the ann however both the ann and rnn underestimated the rainfall amount in particular that of extreme precipitation temporally the rnn improved the accuracy of daily and monthly temperature downscaling results especially that of minimum temperature and extreme temperature events were better simulated using the rnn method for precipitation the problem of underestimating extreme precipitation was effectively alleviated using the rnn randextreme method particularly in summer the response of swat model outputs to meteorological data showed that better flow and evapotranspiration outputs could be obtained using the data downscaled by rnn method for flow high flow condition in wet season was better simulated by using meteorological data downscaled by rnn method and rnn randextreme method further improved the simulation accuracy of flow variation in the extinction period however when the output time scale became rougher from daily to annual the improvement effects were weakened ann even provided better results in annual scale the accuracy of evapotranspiration outputs of swat model was improved by rnn and rnn randextreme method compared to that of ann method at all time scales however the differences between rnn and rnn randextreme method were not significant the results of this study indicated that meteorological data have obvious time series characteristics which should be considered in statistical downscaling procedure and the downscaling accuracy will directly affect the performance of hydrological models thus developing statistical downscaling model which can represent time series characteristics is necessary rnn model was proved effective in this study to be a time series based statistical downscaling model which is better than the traditional ann model for precipitation and temperature

5481,in this study a recurrent neural network rnn was used to perform statistical downscaling and its advantages were showed compared to the traditional artificial neural network ann the hydrological response to the downscaled meteorological data was evaluated using the soil and water assessment tool swat model the results indicated that the temperature downscaled in southeastern china was better than that in northwestern china while precipitation was the opposite although rnn and ann model had different feasibility in different regions of china the performance of rnn model for maximum and minimum temperature downscaling was about 6 and 10 better than that of ann model overall respectively and rnn model was better for extreme temperature conditions simulation regarding precipitation the performance of rnn and ann model was similar when simulating precipitation amount however the use of rnn model improved the prediction accuracy of dry and wet days in order to improve the accuracy of extreme precipitation downscaling a new model rnn randextreme was proposed compared with the ann and single rnn model rnn randextreme model improved the prediction accuracy of extreme precipitation by 28 32 and 16 56 respectively the hydrological simulation results of swat model showed that the rnn and rnn randextreme model significantly improved the accuracy of hydrological simulations of flow and evapotranspiration compared to the ann model however as the time scale became rougher from daily to annual scale the improvement effect of rnn and rnn randextreme model would weaken the results of this study may help improving the accuracy of statistical downscaling and support choosing downscaling models in different areas keywords climate change statistical downscaling recurrent neural network hydrological response swat model 1 introduction climate change related issues have recently been the focus of many studies lesk et al 2016 tokarska and gillett 2018 an increasing number of studies are focusing on the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle hattermann et al 2017 kour et al 2016 vetter et al 2017 as climate change will provoke the reallocation of water resources which will ultimately lead to water contamination problems and pose a threat to human lives piao et al 2010 whitehead et al 2009 the results of studies to date have shown that of all meteorological variables precipitation and temperature changes have the most significant impacts on the hydrological cycle chitra tarak et al 2018 tao and barros 2018 watts et al 2015 as they can influence the process of runoff and evapotranspiration that can lead to floods and droughts globally arnell and gosling 2016 oliver et al 2015 most of these studies have used hydrological models as their base tool to study hydrological responses to climate change abbaspour et al 2015 arnold 1994 gashaw et al 2018 to accurately represent the spatial heterogeneity of hydrology these models require high resolution precipitation and temperature data to evaluate the future impacts of climate change on the hydrological processes in models global climate models gcms have been widely used to acquire climate change data under different scenarios cho et al 2016 li et al 2017 however the spatial resolution of gcms are too low for hydrological models to perform accurate hydrological modeling xu 1999 as a result downscaling is required to obtain future meteorological data with an adequately high spatial resolution and this is conducted by establishing relationships between large scale atmosphere circulation factors and small scale meteorological data chen et al 2012 dynamical and statistical downscaling are the two main methods employed in the downscaling process yhang et al 2017 compared to dynamical downscaling statistical downscaling is time saving and can be applied to large areas hidalgo et al 2008 widmann et al 2003 and thus it is the main method currently used in climate change studies to acquire meteorological data with a high resolution especially over relatively large areas bajracharya et al 2018 snyder et al 2019 regression is a key method used in statistical downscaling as it establishes the relationship between large scale atmosphere circulation factors and small scale meteorological data based on historical data ghosh and mujumdar 2008 however to acquire highly accurate future meteorological data it is necessary to research methods that can improve the performance of regression in statistical downscaling the statistical downscaling methods currently used mainly include the transfer function method weather pattern method and the stochastic weather generator method kioutsioukis et al 2008 in the past linear regression methods were often used to establish the relationship between atmosphere circulation factors and meteorological variables huth 2002 zorita and von storch 1999 however this relationship is often complex and non linear which means it is difficult for linear regression to achieve satisfying downscaling results ghosh and mujumdar 2008 as a result machine learning methods are currently used in statistical downscaling research as they can effectively represent non linear relationships chaudhary et al 2019 yi et al 2018 however almost all these methods only consider the spatial relationship between predictors and predictants but they ignore the temporal continuity of meteorological data sachindra et al 2018 tomozeiu et al 2018 meteorological data are a type of serial data that have temporal correlation characteristics merino et al 2018 nam et al 2016 zaytar and el amrani 2016 and ignoring such temporal continuity causes errors and provides inaccurate downscaling results maqsood et al 2003 zaytar and el amrani 2016 therefore with respect to machine learning methods it is necessary to further study the temporal continuity of statistical downscaling methods to improve the downscaling accuracy the impacts of extreme precipitation on the environment are significant and cannot be ignored in climate change research as extreme precipitation can cause floods soil erosion and lead to serious water contamination carpenter et al 2018 eekhout et al 2018 raghavendra et al 2018 however unlike normal precipitation the occurrence of extreme precipitation is random and uncertain which is difficult to predict lee et al 2017 accurately simulating extreme precipitation is also difficult and many downscaling studies have been conducted to determine a method that enables better prediction of extreme precipitation castellano and degaetano 2016 it has been shown that extreme precipitation can be simulated by referring to historical characteristics castellano and degaetano 2016 thus considering the historical distribution in machine learning methods can improve the simulation accuracy of extreme precipitation events in the statistical downscaling process in this study the machine learning method known as the recurrent neural network rnn was used to conduct downscaling of precipitation and temperature in china in addition the rnn randextreme method which couples the rnn and random generation method was proposed to improve the simulation accuracy of extreme precipitation in the downscaling process the impacts of the temperature and precipitation downscaling accuracy on hydrological processes were then further analyzed based on the soil and water assessment tool swat model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area statistical downscaling was implemented for all the national weather stations in china fig 1 and the weihe upstream watershed in the yellow river basin was chosen as a focus to analyze the impacts of using different statistical downscaling methods on hydrological simulation results the weihe upstream watershed is located within a temperate monsoon climate zone and it experiences high temperature and rain in summer and cold dry weather in winter there are obvious differences in the temperature and precipitation amounts between the four seasons in addition it is known that the hydrological processes in weihe upstream watershed have been significantly affected by climate change zhao et al 2019 2 2 statistical downscaling methods two types of machine learning methods were used as the statistical downscaling methods the traditional artificial neural network ann and the recurrent neural network rnn the ann is a mathematical model that can imitate the thought processes of the human brain and as it can deal with nonlinear problems it has been widely used to process classification and regression issues in many disciplines lecun et al 2015 a multilayer perceptron mlp model was proved to be effective in statistical downscaling yang et al 2018 usually a three layer mlp is enough for downscaling but there is no specific criteria to determine the structure of mlp nam do et al 2011 ahmed et al 2015 the recurrent neural network rnn is an artificial neural network that was developed to extract characteristics in sequential data and predict future trends rumerlhar 1986 compared to the normal ann the rnn can learn and remember information from the past and use it as a state variable to be passed into the next time step graves et al 2013 in this way the characteristics of time series data can be learned and represented the long short term memory lstm model is one of the most widely used rnns and it overcomes the vanishing gradient problem of the original rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the lstm has been widely used in natural language processing nlp and machine translation li et al 2018 xie et al 2019 however few studies considered the time series characteristics and used rnn as statistical downscaling model meteorological data have time series characteristics that could be suitable for being downscaled by the lstm model it is difficult to downscale extreme precipitation because it occurs randomly and the relationship between extreme precipitation and predictor variables are different from that between ordinary rainfall and predictor variables liu et al 2013 this study thus proposes a modified method for generating extreme precipitation called the rnn randextreme in the first step of this model s operation historical extreme precipitation is analyzed to achieve the extreme precipitation threshold value and the extreme precipitation events and amounts in each month for each station in the second step when predicting the rainfall if the simulated rainfall is larger than the rainfall threshold a random selection is then conducted using the extreme precipitation probability statistical information obtained in the first step however if simulated rainfall is larger than the threshold but no extreme precipitation occurred in the historical period the rainfall is assigned a value equal to the threshold in this way extreme precipitation is identified by the rnn model but it is generated by random selection from the historical statistical information of extreme precipitation events the performance of ann and rnn with different structures was analyzed first to find out the optimum model and structure six structures were built up with different numbers of hidden layers and neurons 1 hidden layer and 50 neurons 1 layer and 100 neurons 2 layers and 50 neurons 2 layers and 100 neurons 3 layers and 50 neurons 3 layers and 100 neurons the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate the performance of ann and rnn with different structures on downscaling temperature and the rmse and dry wet day prediction accuracy dwa were used to evaluate that of precipitation the equations of these indices are listed as follows eqs 1 4 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 2 nse i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 4 dwa dc dn where o i is the ith observed data o is the mean value of the observed data p i is the predicted data p is the mean value of the predicted data n is the total count of sample pairs dc is the number of days on which whether it had rain is correctly predicted and dn is the total number of days on which rainfall is predicted 2 3 hydrological response analysis methods the soil and water assessment tool swat model was employed as the hydrological model to analyze the response of the hydrological simulation to the downscaling results swat is a watershed scale time continuous model that was developed by the united states department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars arnold et al 1998 and it was designed to simulate hydrological processes and water quality variation on a watershed scale after decades of development the swat has learned from the successful experiences of other models and it has become one of the most widely used hydrological and water quality simulation models the swat model simulates the hydrological cycle based on the water balance equation eq 5 5 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where s w t is the final soil moisture s w 0 is the initial soil moisture on day i r day is the rainfall amount on day i q surf is the surface runoff on day i e a is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i w seep is the amount of water transferred from the soil profile into the gas zone on day i and q gw is the return flow on day i meteorological data were the most important data used in driving the swat model and they have a considerable impact on simulation results such data included precipitation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed four meteorological input scenarios were established the observed meteorological data were used first as a baseline scenario and precipitation and temperature inputs were then replaced using the downscaled results of the ann rnn and rnn randextreme methods these four swat models were run independently and the outputs of stream flow and evapotranspiration at the outlet channel of the watershed were compared 2 4 data collection the daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation observation data from 1979 to 2017 were obtained from the national meteorological information center data cma cn these data were preprocessed and stations that provided no observation data were excluded after the pretreatment process 573 stations were selected for temperature and 591 stations for precipitation fig 1 and the observed data were used as the predictants in the statistical downscaling process to specifically analyze the temporal simulation characteristics of the ann and rnn stations located within the weihe upstream watershed boundary were selected four stations 52 986 57 014 57 025 and 57 034 were chosen to conduct the temperature analysis and four stations 53 903 56 093 57 014 and 57 028 were chosen to conduct the precipitation analysis different stations were chosen to represent temperature and precipitation as it was difficult to find one station that had a full record of both temperature and precipitation data the national centers for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis dataset was used to provide the predictor variables in the statistical downscaling process www ncep noaa gov and 13 and 19 predictor variables were selected for temperature and precipitation downscaling respectively table 1 all predictor variables were standardized prior to use to eliminate the impact of different dimensions and orders of magnitude on the downscaling results the observation and reanalysis data were divided into train data 1979 2016 and test data 2017 digital elevation model dem data were obtained from the geospatial data cloud www gscloud cn at a resolution of 30 m land use data from 2015 were interpreted from landsat 8 remote sensing image data at a resolution of 30 m soil data at a resolution of 30 m were obtained from the institute of geography at the chinese academy of sciences and all these data were used to build the swat model and to subsequently simulate the hydrological response to the downscaled meteorological data 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance and uncertainty analysis for ann and rnn model overall rnn had obvious better performance than ann model for maximum temperature one hidden layer and 50 neurons was the best structure for both ann and rnn model and the performance of ann and rnn was similar table 2 for minimum temperature rnn models with all structures were better than the ann model except with the three hidden layer and 100 neurons structure rnn with two hidden layers and 100 neurons showed the best performance among all the models for precipitation it was apparent that rnn model was better than ann model table 3 the rnn with one hidden layer and 100 neurons provided the best performance among all rnn structures the average dwa of the best rnn structure was more than 30 higher than the worst rnn structure what s more it could be found that the performance of model didn t always become better with the increase of model complexity especially for ann model ann with the simplest structure even showed the best performance the performance of rnn model also diminished when three layers were employed all the predictants only required the use of rnn with one hidden layer to get the best performance except the minimum temperature however the performance of rnn was improved with an increase in the neuron counts from 50 to 100 when the number of layers was fixed the best structures for ann and rnn model were used to perform following analysis the continuity of meteorological variables is very important and it cannot be ignored in statistical downscaling rnn has a complex structure that takes into consideration time series characteristics overcoming the inherent defect of ann model wang and wu 1998 when a network has a larger number of layers and hidden neurons it is able to use more information and can learn more from the input data lyu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 but the complex model structure requires large amounts of training data lecun et al 2015 and some studies have found no increase in the performance of the neural network with a great increase in its complexity and the performance has even been found to deteriorate he et al 2016 zhang et al 1998 therefore to use the rnn model to conduct statistical downscaling it is necessary to determine an appropriate rnn structure first liu 2019 3 2 spatial variation analysis of downscaling results the spatial patterns of maximum and minimum temperature downscaled by ann and rnn were both similar to those of the observed data fig 2 a c and the spatial distributions of the rmse showed similar variations for both among the different regions fig 2d e the southeastern coastal areas had smaller rmse values than the northwest inland areas however compared to the ann the temperature of the rnn was closer to the observed data for maximum temperature downscaling the rnn provided no apparent advantages over the ann with the same nse and r2 values and rmse differences no greater than 1 table 2 for minimum temperature rnn provided a relatively better performance than ann all the indicators were better than ann and the rmse was improved by up to 8 the ann and rnn provided different feasibilities in different areas of china compared to the rnn the ann provided lower rmse values for maximum temperature in most areas of china except in the northwestern areas fig 2f however this difference was not obvious and the rmse values of both ann and rnn were smaller than 2 c however the rnn provided better simulation results in the northwest of china with rmse values up to 6 smaller than those of the ann different from the downscaling results of maximum temperature the rnn was more suitable than ann in most area of china for downscaling minimum temperature with rmse values that were approximately 10 smaller for precipitation the downscaling results of the ann and rnn showed similar spatial distributions fig 3 a the rmse distribution for both the ann and rnn showed that the downscaling performance of precipitation was better in the northwest than in the southeast fig 3b the rmse value was lower than 5 mm in the northwest but larger than 10 mm in the southeast of china a comparison between the rnn and ann showed that the ann had smaller rmse values in most of china but this difference was not obvious and was less than 0 5 mm however the rnn showed a better capacity for predicting whether rain occurred on one day and the dwa value was 1 5 higher than that of the ann table 3 similar to the rmse the spatial distributions of the dwa for the ann and rnn were better in northwest china than in southeast china with an increase in dwa values of more than 20 fig 3c however the dwa values were higher for the rnn than the ann over a larger area in northwest china a comparison between the dwa of the ann and rnn showed that the rnn performed better at predicting dry wet days for most of china for temperature the rnn model was unable to improve the downscaling performance in all areas use of the ann may be adequate for downscaling temperature in southeast china especially for maximum temperature however in the northwest of china the rnn efficiently improved the downscaling results compared to the ann the temperate continental climate is the dominant climate zone in northwest china and it has large temperature variations that make the periodic fluctuation of temperature more obvious than other areas mogi et al 2017 extreme temperature occurs in the lowlands in northwest china with respect to topography climate zone characteristics and other complex factors which means that temperature is not only affected by intraday atmosphere conditions but also previous conditions huang et al 2010 thus the use of the ann could not provide satisfactory results because it ignores the impact of previous temperature characteristics on intraday temperature whereas time series characteristics and continuity are better considered in the rnn salman et al 2015 therefore temporal fluctuations of temperature are better represented and the previous meteorological condition is better considered in the rnn which helps to improve the accuracy of statistical downscaling compared to the temperature downscaling results using the ann may be better than the rnn for simulating the precipitation amount this could be because the precipitation amount has more random and uncertain than temperature wang et al 2017 which meant that series continuity is weak therefore the rnn may not determine the series characteristics of the precipitation amount or it may even determine the wrong series characteristics the dwa results indicated that the rnn is significantly better than the ann at determining whether rain will occur on a particular day this result could relate to the time series characteristics of the dry and wet day distribution that can be simulated in a traditional way using the markov chain method delleur et al 1989 sonnadara and jayewardene 2015 in addition the rnn can learn from previous days and use comprehensive information to conduct the prediction which cannot be realized by the ann wilby et al 1998 accurately simulating dry and wet days distribution is important for representing the impacts of climate change on hydrological processes faramarzi et al 2013 3 3 temporal analysis of downscaling results for temperature the times series analysis of the four stations in the weihe upstream watershed showed that the rae of both ann and rnn in all the seasons except winter was approximately 20 in winter the rae reached more than 1000 fig 4 a comparison between the time series of ann and rnn for maximum temperature showed that they had almost the same prediction capacity for these four stations with similar values of r2 nse and rmse table 4 however for minimum temperature the rnn showed better indices values for all four stations than ann and the rmse was improved by up to 10 there were no apparent differences between the downscaled daily maximum temperature results of ann and rnn methods fig 4a but the rnn showed a better performance than the ann for minimum temperature with a smaller rae especially in winter with a rae that was one times smaller on average fig 4b the results of monthly average maximum and minimum temperature show that the rnn could achieve results closer to the observed data than the ann especially in summer for maximum temperature and in winter for minimum temperature with up to 1 c fig 5 for precipitation the temporal analysis results showed that the rnn provided better accuracy in predicting whether rain had occurred on a particular day with a dwa higher than that of ann of up to more than 7 on average and the annual rainfall results indicated that the rnn randextreme method obtained closer predicted results to the observed data than the rnn method with a percentage decrease in the underestimation from 36 34 to 28 80 on average table 5 for monthly rainfall the rnn randextreme method improved the rnn results in summer with a percentage reduction in the underestimated amount of precipitation ranging from 0 4 to 10 7 between all four stations fig 6 a with respect to extreme precipitation the results showed that the rnn method performed evidently better than the ann method with the underestimate percentage of extreme precipitation decreased from 66 87 to 57 44 and rnn randextreme method further improved the performance of the rnn with underestimate percentage decreased to 47 93 table 5 furthermore more than 50 of extreme precipitation events were better simulated using the rnn randextreme than using the ann fig 6b the weihe upstream watershed lies within the temperate monsoon climate zone it is relatively difficult to downscale the extreme temperature fluctuations in winter and summer using normal methods coulibaly 2004 fan et al 2013 however the better performance of the rnn for maximum temperature downscaled in summer and minimum temperature downscaled in winter shows that extreme temperature conditions are better simulated using the rnn than the ann this is because rnn considers the past time series and it can effectively learn the fluctuation tendency of extreme temperature arslan and sekertekin 2019 extreme temperature condition variations are the main contributor to changes in hydrological processes manfreda et al 2018 therefore better simulations of extreme temperature need to be employed to more accurately represent the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle chen et al 2019 the temporal analysis of the precipitation downscaling results showed that ann also provided satisfactory accuracy when the required outputs were on an annual scale this is likely related to the daily errors being averaged on an annual scale where the temporal variation characteristics of meteorological data are not reflected shao et al 2019 however the rnn and rnn randextreme methods are more suitable for use than the ann when either daily or monthly scaled outputs are required because compared to the annual scale the temporal variation characteristics of meteorological data are obvious on daily and monthly scales zerenner et al 2018 extreme conditions of precipitation are extremely difficult to simulate souvignet and heinrich 2011 and precipitation errors mainly relate to underestimations of extreme precipitation events instead of non extreme precipitation gutmann et al 2014 haylock et al 2006 simulating extreme precipitation accurately is key to improving the performance of hydrological models zhu et al 2019 to enable the performance of downscaling methods to be ascertained it was thus extremely important to determine whether accurate predictions of extreme precipitation could be made castellano and degaetano 2017 the ann underestimated extreme precipitation more seriously than the rnn but this underestimation was offset by overestimating non extreme precipitation and miscalculation of no rain days to rain days compared to the rnn the rnn randextreme method overcame the problem of underestimating extreme precipitation in the rnn method which occurred due to the high randomness and uncertainty of extreme precipitation wang et al 2019 it has been determined that extreme precipitation has historical analogous characteristics in certain areas dang et al 2019 and it can thus be effectively predicted based on historical distribution using the analogy method castellano and degaetano 2016 3 4 hydrological response to statistical downscaling results the flow simulation results of swat model showed that the rnn and rnn randextreme methods provided superior performances to the ann method the results of daily flow out showed that the rnn and rnn randextreme methods performed better than the ann method in the wet season with rae values that were approximately 10 smaller fig 7 a the rnn randextreme method helps to improve the simulation accuracy of the rnn method especially during the extinction period of flow with an improvement of approximately 25 the monthly averaged flow out results of swat model indicate that the rnn randextreme method provided the best simulation effect of all models with better flow simulation results in seven out of the twelve months the effect was particularly enhanced in summer when the flow was large the annual averaged results of simulated flow of swat model showed that the use of all the three methods underestimated flow but the use of the ann and rnn randextreme methods were obviously better than rnn method with an improvement of about 25 the daily evapotranspiration outputs of swat model indicated that the rnn and rnn randextreme methods significantly improved the simulation accuracy compared to the ann method with rae values smaller than 10 for rnn and rnn randextreme the values for ann were larger than 40 fig 7b the simulated results of swat model for monthly averaged evapotranspiration showed that the rnn and rnn randextreme methods provided better simulated results than the ann in most months with an average improvement of up to 7 the rnn and rnn randextreme methods were also relatively better than the ann method for simulating annual evapotranspiration with comparative improvements of up to 5 however there were no obvious differences between the rnn and rnn randextreme methods in all time scales the flow out and evapotranspiration process are affected by variations in both the precipitation process and temperature zhang et al 2015 the performance relating to amounts of simulated flow and evapotranspiration was improved using the rnn and rnn randextreme methods compared to the ann because the accuracy of temperature and precipitation inputs were increased in particular the high flow condition and extinction period in the flow simulation were better simulated using the rnn randextreme method because extreme precipitation is better estimated by the rnn randextreme method and this directly affected the high flow simulation the accurate high flow simulation results of water transport further improved the simulation accuracy during the extinction process however when the temporal scale became coarser from a daily to an annual scale the improvement effects of the rnn and rnn randextreme weakened and the ann provided better results for flow than the rnn on an annual scale it is considered that this result relates to the overestimation of non extreme precipitation by the ann which coincidentally offset the extreme precipitation underestimation 4 conclusions based on the use of machine learning and big data a time series based rnn method was used to evaluate its ability to downscale temperature and precipitation for precipitation downscaling a new method that coupled the rnn with random extreme precipitation was proposed and this improved consideration of the high uncertainty and randomness of extreme precipitation the spatial analysis results showed that for temperature downscaling stations in the southeast of china were better downscaled than those in the northwest in addition the rnn performed better than the ann throughout most of china when downscaling minimum temperature for maximum temperature the rnn significantly improved the downscaling performance in the northwest of china where temperature variations are large for precipitation downscaling was more effectively applied in the northwest than in the southeast of china furthermore the rnn performed better with dry wet day predictions than the ann however both the ann and rnn underestimated the rainfall amount in particular that of extreme precipitation temporally the rnn improved the accuracy of daily and monthly temperature downscaling results especially that of minimum temperature and extreme temperature events were better simulated using the rnn method for precipitation the problem of underestimating extreme precipitation was effectively alleviated using the rnn randextreme method particularly in summer the response of swat model outputs to meteorological data showed that better flow and evapotranspiration outputs could be obtained using the data downscaled by rnn method for flow high flow condition in wet season was better simulated by using meteorological data downscaled by rnn method and rnn randextreme method further improved the simulation accuracy of flow variation in the extinction period however when the output time scale became rougher from daily to annual the improvement effects were weakened ann even provided better results in annual scale the accuracy of evapotranspiration outputs of swat model was improved by rnn and rnn randextreme method compared to that of ann method at all time scales however the differences between rnn and rnn randextreme method were not significant the results of this study indicated that meteorological data have obvious time series characteristics which should be considered in statistical downscaling procedure and the downscaling accuracy will directly affect the performance of hydrological models thus developing statistical downscaling model which can represent time series characteristics is necessary rnn model was proved effective in this study to be a time series based statistical downscaling model which is better than the traditional ann model for precipitation and temperature

5482,a suitable choice of spatial resolution is essential to the three dimensional 3d image based reconstruction of rock pore space a too low spatial resolution may result in the omission of sub resolution porosity while too high spatial resolution may lead to a field of view smaller than the representative volume in this work the 3d pore spaces of conventional and tight sandstone specimens are reconstructed by x ray computed tomography with spatial resolutions of 2 μm 5 μm 10 μm and 20 μm and equal image voxel quantities 600 600 600 to study the influence of spatial resolution on the reconstruction quality petrophysical properties such as porosities permeabilities and pore throat structure parameters are calculated from the 3d images and measured by helium porosity klinkenberg corrected permeability and mercury intrusion capillary pressure porosimetry for comparison high resolution images are sampled from different positions in the specimens to evaluate the core scale heterogeneities rock textures and pore throat structures of the specimens are analyzed through casting thin sections and micp to find out the origin of the resolution effect the results show that 3d images with any single spatial resolution have limited detectivities to recover the full pore and throat distribution of sandstone specimens which is the root cause of the resolution effect the contributions of different pore genetic types with various pore sizes to petrophysical properties vary with simulation targets and methods for conventional sandstone specimens with only one dominate pore genetic type the appropriate spatial resolution can be chosen by calibrating the simulated petrophysical properties to actual measurements for tight sandstone specimens with several pore genetic

scale fluid distribution werth et al 2010 krummel et al 2013 menke et al 2015 researchers however are often caught in a dilemma in choosing an appropriate spatial resolution for the 3d image of the rock pore space for a cubic image the field of view fov volume can be written as 1 v fov l edge 3 l voxel n edge 3 where v fov is the field of view volume l edge is the edge length of the cubic image l voxel is the voxel side length of the 3d image which reflects the spatial resolution n edge is voxel quantity on the edge of the cubic image zeng et al 2017 n edge is limited either to the camera size and binning of the imaging device s charge coupled detector ccd wildenschild and sheppard 2013 latief et al 2017 or to the simulators storage or computational resources arns et al 2005 mostaghimi et al 2013 latief et al 2017 therefore v fov highly depends on the spatial resolution a low resolution 3d image of the specimen s pore space overlooks the sub resolution porosity shandrygin 2014 soulaine et al 2016 a high resolution image may have a fov smaller than the specimen s representative elementary volume rev failing to statistically overcome the reservoir heterogeneity on a larger scale mostaghimi et al 2013 shandrygin 2014 moreover some sporadically distributed macro features may thereby be missed wildenschild et al 2002 in the previous work on berea sandstone the spatial resolutions varied from 1 5 to 490 μm and the n edge varied from approximately 200 to 1000 bera et al 2011 raeini et al 2014 alyafei et al 2015 soulaine et al 2016 fagbemi et al 2018 zakirov and galeev 2019 most of which lack of a convincible trade off between the spatial resolution and the fov an inappropriate choice of the spatial resolution and the fov for reservoir characterization and simulation may result in misleading petrophysical properties bultreys et al 2016 keehm and mukerji 2004 found that grid point density per autocorrelation length had an influence on the result when generating spatial grids for the lbm peng et al 2012 firstly proposed and discussed the concept of resolution effect by acquiring pore structure parameters from two images in different spatial resolutions of the same sandstone specimen the study proved the unreliability of the image based reconstruction by comparing the pore structure parameters with micp results however peng et al 2012 failed to discover a trend in the pore structure parameters with spatial resolution this is because the two images were not comparable with no fixed scanning setting the latter studies investigated resolution effects on image based petrophysical properties for sandstones and carbonates and a library of those studies are listed in table 1 single phase permeability as a most commonly discussed example was calculated by several methods and it showed various trends with spatial resolution these studies as listed in table 1 proposed a variety of explanations focused on the imagery itself but they lacked of analysis on the pore throat structures of specimens based on petrographic evidences l edge was mostly adopted as a fixed scanning setting to control variable which was straightforward since only one high resolution image was needed for each specimen and the images in other spatial resolutions could be acquired by means of data reduction 1 1 reducing the spatial resolution of the reconstructed image this nonetheless resulted in an identical v fov of images in all spatial resolutions which neglect the advantageously large fov of the low resolution images limited by the imaging device and computing resource the usually consistent scanning setting for reconstruction is n edge which has not been fixed to discuss the resolution effect the heterogeneities of microscale petrophysical properties on the whole core dimension were observed cinar et al 2012 botha and sheppard 2016 xia et al 2019 but their variations with spatial resolution has not been quantitatively discussed with the development of unconventional resources there is a growing demand on the application of 3d image based rock pore space reconstruction on tight sandstone carbonate and shale reservoirs mayo et al 2015 wu et al 2019 these kinds of reservoirs have wider pore size ranges and stronger heterogeneities than conventional sandstone and carbonate reservoirs nelson 2009 bringing more difficulties in choosing spatial resolutions multiscale petrophysical properties have been investigated whereas the resolution effect has not been systematically discussed with fixed l edge or n edge knackstedt et al 2012 alberts et al 2013 müter et al 2014 saraji and piri 2015 wu et al 2017 li et al 2018 the motivation of this work is to investigate the resolution effect on the genuine pore space reconstruction for both conventional and tight sandstone specimens the n edge of the images in all spatial resolutions are identical for an impartial evaluation on the detectivity of low resolution images high resolution images are sampled multiple times from different positions in the specimens to evaluate the heterogeneities encountered in the reconstruction petrophysical properties are calculated from both reconstructed pore spaces and indirect tests to evaluate the deviation of reconstruction in different spatial resolutions rock textures and pore throat structures of the specimens are analyzed through casting thin sections and micp to find out the origin of the resolution effect this work will provide an important reference for researchers to choose appropriate spatial resolutions in 3d rock pore space reconstructions and simulations a process that is vital for understanding the multi phase flow and estimating the recovery of oil and gas resources in both conventional and tight formations 2 methodology 2 1 specimens three sandstone specimens with diminishing porosities are collected for the study one trim of the conventional gray berea sandstone specimen along with whose helium porosity gas klinkenberg corrected permeability k gas and micp porosimetry results is obtained from arawole 2015 two tight sandstone specimens b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 together with their gas and k gas results are collected from zeng et al 2017 the specimens which are cylindrical core plugs 2 5 cm in diameter are visually inspected to be homogeneous with no heterolithic beddings observed all the specimens are oil cleaned with the soxhlet extractor teklu et al 2015 salt cleaned with deionized water and oven dried to remove non mineral phases in the pore space detailed specimen information is listed in table 2 the specimens are firstly scanned by xrct as a whole subsamples with sizes of 1 0 8 are cut out from the specimens b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 for micp porosimetry the rest parts of the specimens b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 along with specimen gray berea are sent to tianhexin company in beijing china to make casting thin sections 2 2 xrct the versa xrm 500 x ray microscope zeiss 2014 is used to obtain the 3d pore space images of the specimens raw images with l voxel of 2 μm and 5 μm are sampled from eight positions and raw images with l voxel of 10 μm are sampled from two positions inside each specimen table 3 3d image processing and pore space segmentation are conducted by thermo scientific avizo 9 software cubic images v fov as displayed in table 3 with n edge of 600 are cropped from raw images table 3 a series of post processing procedures are conducted to the cropped images for the convenience of the pore space segmentation detailed image acquisition and processing procedure is described in appendix 1 part of the cropped processed and segmented pore space images of the gray berea sandstone specimen are displayed in table 4 as examples the pnm blunt et al 2013 is used to characterize the pore and throat structures of the sample images in this work a medial axis transformation algorithm raeini et al 2017 is used to extract pns from the pore space images in the medial axis transformation algorithm the roughness on the pore surface will be regarded as new small pores these small pores would be incorporated into their neighbor pores if they are too small or too close to their neighbor pores the criterion to judge for incorporation depends on both the medial surface settings and the image resolution all medial surface settings are kept consistent for controlling variables the discussion on the influence of the pore surface roughness is thereby equivalent to the discussion on the resolution effect the openpnm package gostick et al 2016 is used to calculate single phase and multiphase properties from the pn parameters such as pore volume v pore pore radius r pore pore coordinates x y z throat volume v throat throat radius r throat throat length l throat pore shape factor f pore and throat shape factor f throat 2 2 mortensen et al 2005 have shown that the hagen poiseuille hydraulic resistance is linearly dependent on the compactness which is defined as perimeter2 area the dependence is not universal as shapes with sharp corners provide more resistance than those that are more elliptical f pore and f throat are calculated by counting the number of vertices and applying the proper correction and the inlet and outlet pore labels are directly read from the pns raeini et al 2017 pmeal 2018 the pore quantity n pore the throat quantity n throat and the maximum throat radius r t h r o a t m a x are counted other pore throat structure parameters such as median throat radius r t h r o a t 50 specific surface s total porosity total effective porosity effective total pore and throat number density n total effective pore and throat number density n effective and tortuosity τ are calculated accordingly appendix 2 the pore size distribution psd and throat size distribution tsd are respectively plotted by calculating the porosity of the pores in each r pore range psd and the porosity of throats in each r throat range tsd appendix 2 permeabilities are simulated by solving stokes flow through openpnm gostick et al 2016 and estimated by kozeny carman equation carman 1956 the openpnm pmeal 2018 is also used for conducting micp simulations on the effective pns detailed principles on the simulation and calculation of permeabilities and micp are seen in appendix 2 2 3 micp porosimetry actual micp porosimetry is also conducted to the three specimens to examine the simulation results in section 2 arawole 2015 s original test data are directly adopted for the gray berea specimen the autopore iv 9520 mercury porosimeter is used for testing the b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 specimens the specimens are evacuated to 50 μm hg 99 993 vacuum in a penetrometer and mercury intruded at an incremental capillary entry pressure p c m i c p from 1 2 psi to 60 000 psi at an equilibrium time of 60 s the cumulative intrusion curves log differential intrusion curves micp derived permeabilities and some geometrical and topological aspects of pore structure are calculated as described in appendix 3 3 results 3 1 rock textures and pore genetic types rock textures and pore genetic types of the three specimens are analyzed from different scopes of the casting thin sections table 5 although the photos under cross polarized light are relatively dark which is owed to the larger thickness and stronger opacity of casting thin sections than ordinary thin sections the interference colors of quartz and feldspar are still visible as illustrated in table 6 the distinction of the tight sandstone specimens mainly results from the relatively fine grains the intense compaction and cementation primary intergranular pores which are dominant in the conventional sandstones like gray berea almost disappear in the tight sandstones compaction induced intragranular and grain edge fractures form a new pore network for specimen b406 s 3 the primary intergranular pores are mainly compacted to become narrow and weakly interconnected pores which are called residual intergranular pores as for x211 s 5 the residual intergranular pores are further filled with clay minerals and cement to become intercrystalline pores the visibilities of different types of pores in a thin section vary under different scopes the primary intergranular pores of gray berea sandstone specimen are homogeneous under 5x and 10x objectives under the 20x objective nevertheless only a part of a pore is observed which means that the size and the geometry of the pore closely depend on the position of the high power image the residual intergranular pores in specimen b406 s 3 are visible but have various sizes and geometries under all objectives for specimen x211 s 5 the intercrystalline pores are only observed as clusters the diagenetic fractures are visible under all objectives but are isolated and anisotropic under 20x objective 3 2 pore and throat size distribution the whole pore throat size distributions are manifested by the log differential intrusion curves measured by micp porosimetry fig 1 four inflection points are detected on each of the log differential intrusion curve which means that there are at least four individual conduction paths in each specimen appendix 2 the volumes and radii of these conductance paths vary greatly in the gray berea sandstone specimen the conductance path with a maximum r t of 16 5 μm dominates in the whole pore system as for the tight sandstone specimens of b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 the throat radii distribute widely from 10 2 μm to 102 μm the conductance paths with r t of 0 889 μm and 0 0612 μm in specimen b406 s 3 and the conductance paths with r t of 0 387 μm in specimen x211 s 5 contribute moderately more to porosities the conduction paths with the largest r t have minor contributions to the total porosities table 7 illustrates the psd and tsd results derived from the 3d images of the three specimens the oscillations of the psd and tsd curves manifest the variations of the pore and throat contents with their radii in spite of the general similarities of the psd and tsd of the sample images in the same l voxel the local contrasts and their growth with spatial resolution still exhibit the heterogeneities of the specimens for the gray berea sandstone specimen the psds and tsds from the sample images 2 μm in l voxel almost recover those from the other sample images nevertheless sample images 2 μm in l voxel exhibit strong heterogeneities in the r pore range over 50 μm and r throat range over 40 μm indicating an unstable detectivity of large pores and throats for the b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 tight sandstone specimens the tsds from 2 μm l voxel images still recover the other tsds while none of the psds can fully recover the psds from the other spatial resolutions generally speaking a larger l voxel leads to a stronger detectivity of large pores and throats and a poorer detectivity of small pores and throats table 8 compares the cumulative mercury intrusion results measured by micp porosimetry and simulated from the 3d images the p c s hg curves and p c c curves measured by micp porosimetry of gray berea sandstone specimen distribute from several kpa to several 104 kpa the curves measured by the actual tests of b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 tight sandstone specimens distribute from several 10 kpa to several 105 kpa all curves simulated from the 3d images however are restricted from several 10 kpa to several 103 kpa the r throat obtained from a 3d image with an n edge of 600 varies within two orders of magnitude table 7 while based on the eq 19 the r c obtained by micp porosimetry varies over four orders of magnitude in a sandstone specimen for this reason to fully recover the psd or tsd of a specimen at least two images with an l voxel difference of two orders of magnitude are required the p c s hg curve derived from 20 μm l voxel sample image of gray berea sandstone specimen and the p c s hg curves derived from sample images of b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 tight sandstone specimens appear to start from s hg values that are greater than 0 table 8 that is because the n effective from these sample images is so small fig 3 d that even when several pores and throats with p c m i n are mercury invaded an obvious s hg change on the curve can be identified the p c s hg curves simulated from the 3d images exhibit deviations from the p c s hg curves measured by the actual micp porosimetries and the deviation grows with the specimen s porosity decrement table 8 the p c c curves simulated from the 3d images better fit the curves measured by the actual micp porosimetries for specimen gray berea the p c c curves simulated from the 2 μm l voxel sample images overestimate the c values while the curves simulated from the sample images with larger l voxel underestimate the c values for specimens b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 the c values are overestimated from the sample images regardless of the l voxel values 3 3 petrophysical properties it can be seen from fig 2 that the micp porosimetry derived k t values are overestimated when compared with k gas results the k t variation with r t nonetheless still shows the contribution contrast of different conductance paths to specimens permeabilities the conductance path with the largest r t of 16 5 μm in specimen gray berea has the highest k t which is about 460 times of the second highest k t there is no doubt that this largest conductance path is the only major contributor to the permeability of specimen gray berea the permeability contrasts between the largest conductance paths r t of 10 3 μm and 0 889 μm in specimen b406 s 3 and among the three largest conductance paths r t of 20 6 μm 4 11 μm and 0 387 μm in specimen x211 s 5 are not as obvious as in the specimen gray berea for this reason these conductance paths play perceptible roles in their respective conductance systems the rest of the conductance paths can be regarded as ineffective since their τ t values are too high 50 fig 3 shows the image derived petrophysical property variations with l voxel the petrophysical properties such as gas k gas and micp porosimetry derived pore throat structure parameters are lined for comparison the minimum τ t for each specimen is chosen generally these petrophysical properties change monotonically with l voxel while the regularity varies with the property type and the calculation method the total effective n total and n effective values from all sample images are smaller than the real values measured by helium pycnometer or micp porosimetry indicating a limited detectivity of the image with a single spatial resolution these values decrease with the l voxel increment fig 3 a d indicating a relatively smaller porosity contribution of the large pores and throats the trends in the image derived throat radius parameters r t h r o a t 50 and r t h r o a t m a x with l voxel are not as obvious as other petrophysical properties fig 3 e f some r t h r o a t 50 from images 10 μm and 20 μm in l voxel are inapplicable for the loss of throat information appendix 2 the r t h r o a t 50 and r t h r o a t m a x from images of gray berea sandstone specimen are smaller than those from micp porosimetry tests while the r t h r o a t 50 and r t h r o a t m a x values from images of b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 tight sandstone specimens are larger than those from micp porosimetry tests the image derived s decreases with the l voxel increment fig 3 g even the largest image derived s are at least two orders of magnitude lower than the micp porosimetry derived value the calculation of τ for some images is inapplicable for the loss of throat information appendix 2 the applicable τ value increases with the l voxel increment fig 3 h micp porosimetry derived τ t values are higher than the image derived ones the spatial resolution has different effects on permeabilities calculated through different methods both k ns and k kc values manifest decreasing trends with the l voxel increment fig 3 i j k ns values are generally lower than k gas values and k ns values from higher resolution images are closer to k gas values k kc values on the contrary are much higher than k gas values so k kc values from lower resolution images are closer to k gas values 3 4 heterogeneity the standard deviations of the petrophysical properties from images in the same l voxel are calculated to evaluate the core scale heterogeneity and its relationship with v fov fig 4 shows that the standard deviations of most petrophysical properties increase with the decrement of l voxel except r t h r o a t m a x the standard deviations of τ and k ns from 3d images of specimens b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 are inapplicable because τ and k ns themselves are inapplicable section 3 3 on the other hand the contrast between the presence and absence of these properties also indicate the heterogeneities of the specimens overall the high resolution small fov pore space images are more heterogeneous 4 discussions 4 1 origins of the resolution effects as is revealed in section 3 2 the psd and tsd detected by 3d images which were called discrete psd münch and holzer 2008 have much smaller spans than the actual psd and tsd of a sandstone specimen it is impossible to fully recover the pore throat system of the specimen via a single image based pore space reconstruction all the resolution effects originate from this shortage of single image based pore space reconstruction process for different rock types petrophysical properties and calculation methods the resolution effects and their mechanisms are not exactly the same for conventional sandstone specimen of gray berea the largest conductance path with r t of 16 5 μm contributes more than 80 of the porosity and more than 99 of the permeability the pore space of gray berea sandstone can be thereby regarded as a single porosity medium composed of only primary intergranular pores simulations of pore scale phenomena like fluid percolation can be to some extent accurate once the primary intergranular pores are correctly reconstructed although the r throat values of the whole pore system vary over four orders of magnitude the r throat values of intergranular pores vary within two orders of magnitude the pore space reconstructed from 3d images 600 in n voxel is hence reliable for petrophysical simulation as long as the image spatial resolution is chosen appropriately an image spatial resolution appropriate for one kind of simulation is however not necessarily appropriate for another kind for example the accuracy of k ns simulation depends on the recovery of the throat characteristics so the image spatial resolution should be high enough to capture all the throats of intergranular pores the accuracy of k kc calculation on the contrary rely on the porosity of intergranular pores so the image spatial resolution should be low enough to avoid counting micro porosity fig 3 for tight sandstone specimens of b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 the pores are widely distributed in a r t range from 10 2 μm to 102 μm fig 1 at least two conductance paths with great r t contrast are effective in each tight sandstone specimens whose pore spaces can be thereby considered as multi porosity media since primary intergranular pores almost disappear in these tight sandstone specimens table 5 the largest conductance paths r t 10 3 μm in specimen b406 s 3 r t 4 11 μm and 20 6 μm in specimen x211 s 5 are inferred to be composed of intragranular and grain edge fractures these microfractures have large r throat relative to other pore genetic types in the tight sandstones but they also have strong anisotropies and weak interconnectivities the strip shapes and unstable continuities make microfractures easy to penetrate a small region like the fov of a 3d image but difficult to interconnect through the whole sample for micp porosimetry some isolated microfractures are prone to be determined as effective pores in the image based calculation which is the reason that the image derived c values are higher than the micp porosimetry derived c values for the same tight sandstone specimen this also accounts for that most of the image derived k ns values and τ values of tight sandstone specimens are inapplicable but the applicable τ values derived from 3d images are even lower than the lowest τ t values thanks to their large r t and low τ t the microfractures contribute the most to the permeabilities of tight sandstones despite that very few of them get interconnected throughout the samples and contribute little to the total porosities as a consequence both the absence and the misjudgment of the effective microfractures can lead to miscalculation of k ns from 3d images the conductance paths which contribute the most to porosities r t 0 889 μm and 0 0612 μm in specimen b406 s 3 r t 0 387 μm in specimen x211 s 5 are composed of much smaller residual intergranular pores and intercrystalline pores in spite of their small r throat the high content of these small pores allows them to better interconnect with each other to constitute amounts of parallel pathways the conductance paths are hence effective and have non negligible contributions to the permeabilities of tight sandstones the reconstruction of residual intergranular pores and intercrystalline pores requires a higher resolution of the imaging device so the resolution effect and heterogeneity of tight sandstones require further research moreover smaller pores have larger quantities and surface area with the same total volume which is reflected by the fact that n total n effective and s increase with l voxel decrement but never reach the actual value measured by micp porosimetry it can be conjectured from this point that the contributions of different pore genetic types in tight sandstones are process specific for example although small pores contribute less to the hydraulic conductivity their contribution to the surface reaction is dominant because of their large specific areas peng et al 2014 4 2 pore space reconstruction strategies based on the above analysis the pore space reconstruction for a sandstone specimen should be made according to the pore throat structure of the specimen the target petrophysical property and the simulation or calculation method for conventional sandstone specimens such as gray berea the key is to accurately recover the information of primary intergranular pores the n edge should be large enough to detect the psd or tsd span of two orders of magnitude another measurement should be carried out on the specimen to acquire a reference value of the target petrophysical property the image spatial resolution can then be adjusted to calibrate the image based simulation result on the reference value high resolution images should be sampled multiple times from different positions in the specimens to overcome the heterogeneity brought by small fov if no direct measurement can be used to acquire the target petrophysical property the decisive pore throat structure parameters e g tsd in the k ns simulation should be identified first and then the alternative measurement for calibration should be found accordingly a recommendable alternative measurement is micp porosimetry from which most of the pore throat structure parameters can be acquired notice that the spatial resolution adjusted for one kind of simulation may not be suitable for another kind of simulation as for tight sandstone specimens like b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 the pore spaces are multi porosity media composed of several types of pores each of which may play a part in the simulation of a petrophysical property in this situation the optimal solution is to combine images with multiple spatial resolutions to generate a synthetical model jiang et al 2013 mehmani and prodanović 2014 prodanović et al 2015 if images with only one spatial resolution are allowed for the simulation a knowledge of the content of different pore genetic types and their contribution to the target petrophysical property is necessary to decide which pore genetic type to recover if the phenomenon to be simulated mainly happens in the intragranular and grain edge fractures a large fov would be suggested to discriminate the effective fractures throughout the sample if the target petrophysical property happens to be orientation dependent it is better to simulate in all the directions with the consideration of the anisotropy if the phenomenon mainly happens in large pore spaces or pore surfaces a high image spatial resolution is supposed to detect as much residual intergranular pores and intercrystalline pores as possible images should be sampled multiple times from different positions in case of the heterogeneity 5 conclusions the 3d pore space of three sandstone specimens with diminishing porosities are reconstructed from 3d images with escalating spatial resolutions to evaluate the resolution effect on both the conventional and the tight sandstone reservoirs high resolution images are sampled multiple times from different positions in the specimens to evaluate the core scale heterogeneities casting thin section analyses and micp porosimetries are conducted to discover the pore genetic types and pore throat structures petrophysical properties are calculated from both 3d images and micp porosimetry results for comparison it is found that the throat radius obtained from a 3d image with an edge voxel quantity of 600 changes within two orders of magnitude while the throat radius detected by micp porosimetry changes over four orders of magnitude in a sandstone specimen it is thus impossible to fully recover the pore throat system of the specimen via a single image based pore space reconstruction a too low spatial resolution will lead to the missing of small pores and throats while a too high spatial resolution will lead to the unstable detectivity of large pores for conventional sandstone specimens the pore spaces can be regarded as single porosity media composed of only primary intergranular pores the throat radius of intergranular pores mainly varies within two orders of magnitude so the reconstructed pore space is still reliable for petrophysical simulation if the spatial resolution is chosen appropriately the determination strategy of the spatial resolution is to calibrate the image derived petrophysical properties on the ones measured by other pore structure probes according to the trends in image derived petrophysical properties with the spatial resolution as for tight sandstone specimens the pore spaces are multi porosity media composed of several types of pores with throat radii varying in four orders of magnitude only one pore genetic type can be recovered via a single image based pore space reconstruction the contributions of different pore genetic types to pore scale simulations are process specific so the content of different pore genetic types and their

quality of paper substantially appendix 1 image acquisition and processing details image acquisition a routine recipe recommended by zeiss microscopy is adopted for the image acquisition the x rays are induced by an electron beam with a 130 kv voltage and 10 w power with no fluorite lens filtering kak and slaney 2001 because all the fovs are inside the specimens the accurate spatial resolutions of 2 μm 5 μm 10 μm and 20 μm in l voxel an error lower than 1 are achieved by altering the objectives for various optical magnifications shah et al 2015 and adjusting the relative positions of source sample and ccd for various cone shaped beam magnifications arns et al 2005 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 the samples are rotated in an angle of 360 3200 per projection to acquire 3200 radiographs for the reconstruction of the cylindrical raw images andrew and hornberger 2018 image processing cubic images v fov as shown in table 3 with n edge of 600 are cropped from the very center of the raw images table 4 a shading correction 3 3 correction of the shading from a pre computed background with a histogram spreading pixel by pixel saraji and piri 2015 is conducted to the cubic images 2 μm and 5 μm in l voxel to reduce the intensity bias induced by the beam hardening effect 4 4 for polychromatic beams the low energy and thus strongly attenuated photons are eliminated from the beam at a faster rate than the higher weakly attenuated energy levels consequently the longer the ray paths through the object the more low energy photons are absorbed resulting in a more penetrating beam iassonov and tuller 2010 a non local means filter 5 5 a linear filter does not use a small sized kernel but potentially the entire image as a search window buades et al 2005 is applied to all the cubic images to improve the signal to noise ratio snr without smoothing the phase edges schlüter et al 2014 pore space segmentation is a crucial step to influence the porosity pore geometrical and topological parameters iassonov et al 2009 bultreys et al 2016 among the previous studies on the resolution effect the otsu multi thresholding method 6 6 the method finds a threshold value which minimizes the within class variances of background and foreground voxel classes which is equivalent to maximizing the variance between the means of the two clustered classes otsu 1979 was the most widely used keehm and mukerji 2004 alyafei et al 2013 müter et al 2014 alyafei et al 2015 gooya et al 2016 latief et al 2017 however a binarization with a single criterion is arbitrary for an image with a biased intensity background several studies arns et al 2005 peng et al 2012 beckingham et al 2013 applied a locally adaptive method of indicator kriging 7 7 two thresholds are specified by the user to define two a priori classes the upper threshold of the unclassified range is extended toward gray values that definitely belong to a high intensity class the class assignment at an unclassified location depends on the weighted average of indicator values in its neighborhood where the weights are obtained by kriging wonho and lindquist 1999 which nevertheless cannot cope with the partial volume effects caused by blur schlüter et al 2014 in this work a watershed method vincent and soille 1991 is used for segmentation the mineral phase and the pore phase which are visually affirmed by a conservative global thresholding are pre specified as the seeds of the markers the crest lines of the markers are subsequently determined by the marker based watershed module in avizo 9 software isolated minerals in the pore space are incorporated into the pore space assuming no mineral floating appendix 2 image based calculation pore throat structure parameters to calculate r t h r o a t 50 the volumes of the throats and the pores connected to the throats are added up in a descending r throat order until the summation reaches 50 of the total pore and throat volume the r throat of the smallest throat counted are considered as r t h r o a t 50 in the pn generated from some low resolution images the detected throats are so few that even after the volumes of all the detected throats and the pores connected to the throats are added the summation still cannot reach a half of the total pore and throat volume in this situation the r t h r o a t 50 values are not obtained the specific surface s is defined as the ratio of total pore and throat surface area to total pore and throat volume the pore area a pore and throat area a throat are firstly calculated as 2 a pore r pore

are both inlet pores and outlet pores in the effective pnm for some pns abstracted from the low resolution images either inlet pores or outlet pores are trimmed out as a consequence of the throat information loss in this situation τ is not obtained psd is 10 psd r lower r pore r upper v pore v fov where r lower and r upper are the lower and the upper limit of the radius range respectively in this work the span of the radius range r upper r lower is 5 μm tsd is 11 tsd r lower r throat r upper v throat v fov where r lower and r upper are the lower and the upper limit of the radius range respectively in this work the span of the radius range r upper r lower is 5 μm permeabilities in the openpnm algorithms stokesflow module the flow between two neighboring pores is treated as flow through a pipe thus the hagen poiseuille equation is used for single phase flow 12 q π r throat 4 p i p j 8 μ l throat where q is the flow rate between the two neighboring pores p i and p j are the pore pressures in the neighboring pores μ is fluid viscosity the simulated permeability k ns is calculated as below 13 k ns μ outlet q δ p l edge where δ p is the pressure difference between inlet and outlet pores for the same reason as τ k ns is inapplicable if either no inlet pore or no outlet pore is in the effective pn the permeability estimated by kozeny carman equation k kc is calculated as below 14 k kc total 3 c s 2 1 total 2 where c is the kozeny carman constant and generally given the value of 5 carman 1956 micp simulation the pn based cumulative mercury intrusion curves are simulated by assuming each throat in the pn as cylindrical in shape the capillary entry pressure p c of the throat can be thereby calculated based on the young laplace equation 15 p c 2 γ cos θ r c where γ is the mercury surface tension and given as 485 mn m θ is the mercury mercury vapor contact angle given at 130 r c is the radius of the throat for mercury to invade at p c the p c mercury

at p c permeabilities according to katz and thompson 1987 with the intrusion pressure increment mercury is forced to invade smaller and smaller pore openings until a threshold pressure p t is reached for mercury to percolate in a conduction path this conduction path is composed of pores and throats with diameters larger than the throat diameter d t corresponding to p t as the intrusion pressure further increases the mercury percolate faster and faster until the intrusion pressure is high enough for mercury to invade another conduction path under this intrusion pressure p max the hydraulic conductance of the conduction path is maximum so that the permeability of the conduction path k t can be calculated as 21 k t 1 89 d max 2 d max d t gas s hg d max where d max is the throat diameter corresponding to the p max s hg d max is the mercury saturation at d max gao and hu 2013 hu et al 2015 p t and d t were determined on the inflection point of the log differential intrusion curve when mercury starts to percolate the conductance path katz and thompson 1987 gao and hu 2013 as is seen on fig 1 there are more than one inflection points and d t on the log differential intrusion curve of a specimen which means that there are several individual conductance paths with different d t in one specimen in consideration of this an intensive sampling employed by hu et al 2018 is adopted to detect four inflection points automatically detected by software for each specimen and to calculate one k t for each conductance path pore throat structure parameters according to rootare and prenzlow 1967 the total surface area a total is calculated as 22 a total p c d v c γ cos θ p c δ v c γ cos θ the specific surface s is 23 s a total v total and the pore and throat density n is 24 n 1 π r c 2 l

calculated for each inflection point of the log differential intrusion curves as well as k t 
5482,a suitable choice of spatial resolution is essential to the three dimensional 3d image based reconstruction of rock pore space a too low spatial resolution may result in the omission of sub resolution porosity while too high spatial resolution may lead to a field of view smaller than the representative volume in this work the 3d pore spaces of conventional and tight sandstone specimens are reconstructed by x ray computed tomography with spatial resolutions of 2 μm 5 μm 10 μm and 20 μm and equal image voxel quantities 600 600 600 to study the influence of spatial resolution on the reconstruction quality petrophysical properties such as porosities permeabilities and pore throat structure parameters are calculated from the 3d images and measured by helium porosity klinkenberg corrected permeability and mercury intrusion capillary pressure porosimetry for comparison high resolution images are sampled from different positions in the specimens to evaluate the core scale heterogeneities rock textures and pore throat structures of the specimens are analyzed through casting thin sections and micp to find out the origin of the resolution effect the results show that 3d images with any single spatial resolution have limited detectivities to recover the full pore and throat distribution of sandstone specimens which is the root cause of the resolution effect the contributions of different pore genetic types with various pore sizes to petrophysical properties vary with simulation targets and methods for conventional sandstone specimens with only one dominate pore genetic type the appropriate spatial resolution can be chosen by calibrating the simulated petrophysical properties to actual measurements for tight sandstone specimens with several pore genetic

of the reservoirs golparvar et al 2018 experimental simulation in actual rock specimens or artificial glass bead packs can also be monitored by 3d imagination of micro rock frame deformation or pore scale fluid distribution werth et al 2010 krummel et al 2013 menke et al 2015 researchers however are often caught in a dilemma in choosing an appropriate spatial resolution for the 3d image of the rock pore space for a cubic image the field of view fov volume can be written as 1 v fov l edge 3 l voxel n edge 3 where v fov is the field of view volume l edge is the edge length of the cubic image l voxel is the voxel side length of the 3d image which reflects the spatial resolution n edge is voxel quantity on the edge of the cubic image zeng et al 2017 n edge is limited either to the camera size and binning of the imaging device s charge coupled detector ccd wildenschild and sheppard 2013 latief et al 2017 or to the simulators storage or computational resources arns et al 2005 mostaghimi et al 2013 latief et al 2017 therefore v fov highly depends on the spatial resolution a low resolution 3d image of the specimen s pore space overlooks the sub resolution porosity shandrygin 2014 soulaine et al 2016 a high resolution image may have a fov smaller than the specimen s representative elementary volume rev failing to statistically overcome the reservoir heterogeneity on a larger scale mostaghimi et al 2013 shandrygin 2014 moreover some sporadically distributed macro features may thereby be missed wildenschild et al 2002 in the previous work on berea sandstone the spatial resolutions varied from 1 5 to 490 μm and the n edge varied from approximately 200 to 1000 bera et al 2011 raeini et al 2014 alyafei et al 2015 soulaine et al 2016 fagbemi et al 2018 zakirov and galeev 2019 most of which lack of a convincible trade off between the spatial resolution and the fov an inappropriate choice of the spatial resolution and the fov for reservoir characterization and simulation may result in misleading petrophysical properties bultreys et al 2016 keehm and mukerji 2004 found that grid point density per autocorrelation length had an influence on the result when generating spatial grids for the lbm peng et al 2012 firstly proposed and discussed the concept of resolution effect by acquiring pore structure parameters from two images in different spatial resolutions of the same sandstone specimen the study proved the unreliability of the image based reconstruction by comparing the pore structure parameters with micp results however peng et al 2012 failed to discover a trend in the pore structure parameters with spatial resolution this is because the two images were not comparable with no fixed scanning setting the latter studies investigated resolution effects on image based petrophysical properties for sandstones and carbonates and a library of those studies are listed in table 1 single phase permeability as a most commonly discussed example was calculated by several methods and it showed various trends with spatial resolution these studies as listed in table 1 proposed a variety of explanations focused on the imagery itself but they lacked of analysis on the pore throat structures of specimens based on petrographic evidences l edge was mostly adopted as a fixed scanning setting to control variable which was straightforward since only one high resolution image was needed for each specimen and the images in other spatial resolutions could be acquired by means of data reduction 1 1 reducing the spatial resolution of the reconstructed image this nonetheless resulted in an identical v fov of images in all spatial resolutions which neglect the advantageously large fov of the low resolution images limited by the imaging device and computing resource the usually consistent scanning setting for reconstruction is n edge which has not been fixed to discuss the resolution effect the heterogeneities of microscale petrophysical properties on the whole core dimension were observed cinar et al 2012 botha and sheppard 2016 xia et al 2019 but their variations with spatial resolution has not been quantitatively discussed with the development of unconventional resources there is a growing demand on the application of 3d image based rock pore space reconstruction on tight sandstone carbonate and shale reservoirs mayo et al 2015 wu et al 2019 these kinds of reservoirs have wider pore size ranges and stronger heterogeneities than conventional sandstone and carbonate reservoirs nelson 2009 bringing more difficulties in choosing spatial resolutions multiscale petrophysical properties have been investigated whereas the resolution effect has not been systematically discussed with fixed l edge or n edge knackstedt et al 2012 alberts et al 2013 müter et al 2014 saraji and piri 2015 wu et al 2017 li et al 2018 the motivation of this work is to investigate the resolution effect on the genuine pore space reconstruction for both conventional and tight sandstone specimens the n edge of the images in all spatial resolutions are identical for an impartial evaluation on the detectivity of low resolution images high resolution images are sampled multiple times from different positions in the specimens to evaluate the heterogeneities encountered in the reconstruction petrophysical properties are calculated from both reconstructed pore spaces and indirect tests to evaluate the deviation of reconstruction in different spatial resolutions rock textures and pore throat structures of the specimens are analyzed through casting thin sections and micp to find out the origin of the resolution effect this work will provide an important reference for researchers to choose appropriate spatial resolutions in 3d rock pore space reconstructions and simulations a process that is vital for understanding the multi phase flow and estimating the recovery of oil and gas resources in both conventional and tight formations 2 methodology 2 1 specimens three sandstone specimens with diminishing porosities are collected for the study one trim of the conventional gray berea sandstone specimen along with whose helium porosity gas klinkenberg corrected permeability k gas and micp porosimetry results is obtained from arawole 2015 two tight sandstone specimens b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 together with their gas and k gas results are collected from zeng et al 2017 the specimens which are cylindrical core plugs 2 5 cm in diameter are visually inspected to be homogeneous with no heterolithic beddings observed all the specimens are oil cleaned with the soxhlet extractor teklu et al 2015 salt cleaned with deionized water and oven dried to remove non mineral phases in the pore space detailed specimen information is listed in table 2 the specimens are firstly scanned by xrct as a whole subsamples with sizes of 1 0 8 are cut out from the specimens b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 for micp porosimetry the rest parts of the specimens b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 along with specimen gray berea are sent to tianhexin company in beijing china to make casting thin sections 2 2 xrct the versa xrm 500 x ray microscope zeiss 2014 is used to obtain the 3d pore space images of the specimens raw images with l voxel of 2 μm and 5 μm are sampled from eight positions and raw images with l voxel of 10 μm are sampled from two positions inside each specimen table 3 3d image processing and pore space segmentation are conducted by thermo scientific avizo 9 software cubic images v fov as displayed in table 3 with n edge of 600 are cropped from raw images table 3 a series of post processing procedures are conducted to the cropped images for the convenience of the pore space segmentation detailed image acquisition and processing procedure is described in appendix 1 part of the cropped processed and segmented pore space images of the gray berea sandstone specimen are displayed in table 4 as examples the pnm blunt et al 2013 is used to characterize the pore and throat structures of the sample images in this work a medial axis transformation algorithm raeini et al 2017 is used to extract pns from the pore space images in the medial axis transformation algorithm the roughness on the pore surface will be regarded as new small pores these small pores would be incorporated into their neighbor pores if they are too small or too close to their neighbor pores the criterion to judge for incorporation depends on both the medial surface settings and the image resolution all medial surface settings are kept consistent for controlling variables the discussion on the influence of the pore surface roughness is thereby equivalent to the discussion on the resolution effect the openpnm package gostick et al 2016 is used to calculate single phase and multiphase properties from the pn parameters such as pore volume v pore pore radius r pore pore coordinates x y z throat volume v throat throat radius r throat throat length l throat pore shape factor f pore and throat shape factor f throat 2 2 mortensen et al 2005 have shown that the hagen poiseuille hydraulic resistance is linearly dependent on the compactness which is defined as perimeter2 area the dependence is not universal as shapes with sharp corners provide more resistance than those that are more elliptical f pore and f throat are calculated by counting the number of vertices and applying the proper correction and the inlet and outlet pore labels are directly read from the pns raeini et al 2017 pmeal 2018 the pore quantity n pore the throat quantity n throat and the maximum throat radius r t h r o a t m a x are counted other pore throat structure parameters such as median throat radius r t h r o a t 50 specific surface s total porosity total effective porosity effective total pore and throat number density n total effective pore and throat number density n effective and tortuosity τ are calculated accordingly appendix 2 the pore size distribution psd and throat size distribution tsd are respectively plotted by calculating the porosity of the pores in each r pore range psd and the porosity of throats in each r throat range tsd appendix 2 permeabilities are simulated by solving stokes flow through openpnm gostick et al 2016 and estimated by kozeny carman equation carman 1956 the openpnm pmeal 2018 is also used for conducting micp simulations on the effective pns detailed principles on the simulation and calculation of permeabilities and micp are seen in appendix 2 2 3 micp porosimetry actual micp porosimetry is also conducted to the three specimens to examine the simulation results in section 2 arawole 2015 s original test data are directly adopted for the gray berea specimen the autopore iv 9520 mercury porosimeter is used for testing the b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 specimens the specimens are evacuated to 50 μm hg 99 993 vacuum in a penetrometer and mercury intruded at an incremental capillary entry pressure p c m i c p from 1 2 psi to 60 000 psi at an equilibrium time of 60 s the cumulative intrusion curves log differential intrusion curves micp derived permeabilities and some geometrical and topological aspects of pore structure are calculated as described in appendix 3 3 results 3 1 rock textures and pore genetic types rock textures and pore genetic types of the three specimens are analyzed from different scopes of the casting thin sections table 5 although the photos under cross polarized light are relatively dark which is owed to the larger thickness and stronger opacity of casting thin sections than ordinary thin sections the interference colors of quartz and feldspar are still visible as illustrated in table 6 the distinction of the tight sandstone specimens mainly results from the relatively fine grains the intense compaction and cementation primary intergranular pores which are dominant in the conventional sandstones like gray berea almost disappear in the tight sandstones compaction induced intragranular and grain edge fractures form a new pore network for specimen b406 s 3 the primary intergranular pores are mainly compacted to become narrow and weakly interconnected pores which are called residual intergranular pores as for x211 s 5 the residual intergranular pores are further filled with clay minerals and cement to become intercrystalline pores the visibilities of different types of pores in a thin section vary under different scopes the primary intergranular pores of gray berea sandstone specimen are homogeneous under 5x and 10x objectives under the 20x objective nevertheless only a part of a pore is observed which means that the size and the geometry of the pore closely depend on the position of the high power image the residual intergranular pores in specimen b406 s 3 are visible but have various sizes and geometries under all objectives for specimen x211 s 5 the intercrystalline pores are only observed as clusters the diagenetic fractures are visible under all objectives but are isolated and anisotropic under 20x objective 3 2 pore and throat size distribution the whole pore throat size distributions are manifested by the log differential intrusion curves measured by micp porosimetry fig 1 four inflection points are detected on each of the log differential intrusion curve which means that there are at least four individual conduction paths in each specimen appendix 2 the volumes and radii of these conductance paths vary greatly in the gray berea sandstone specimen the conductance path with a maximum r t of 16 5 μm dominates in the whole pore system as for the tight sandstone specimens of b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 the throat radii distribute widely from 10 2 μm to 102 μm the conductance paths with r t of 0 889 μm and 0 0612 μm in specimen b406 s 3 and the conductance paths with r t of 0 387 μm in specimen x211 s 5 contribute moderately more to porosities the conduction paths with the largest r t have minor contributions to the total porosities table 7 illustrates the psd and tsd results derived from the 3d images of the three specimens the oscillations of the psd and tsd curves manifest the variations of the pore and throat contents with their radii in spite of the general similarities of the psd and tsd of the sample images in the same l voxel the local contrasts and their growth with spatial resolution still exhibit the heterogeneities of the specimens for the gray berea sandstone specimen the psds and tsds from the sample images 2 μm in l voxel almost recover those from the other sample images nevertheless sample images 2 μm in l voxel exhibit strong heterogeneities in the r pore range over 50 μm and r throat range over 40 μm indicating an unstable detectivity of large pores and throats for the b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 tight sandstone specimens the tsds from 2 μm l voxel images still recover the other tsds while none of the psds can fully recover the psds from the other spatial resolutions generally speaking a larger l voxel leads to a stronger detectivity of large pores and throats and a poorer detectivity of small pores and throats table 8 compares the cumulative mercury intrusion results measured by micp porosimetry and simulated from the 3d images the p c s hg curves and p c c curves measured by micp porosimetry of gray berea sandstone specimen distribute from several kpa to several 104 kpa the curves measured by the actual tests of b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 tight sandstone specimens distribute from several 10 kpa to several 105 kpa all curves simulated from the 3d images however are restricted from several 10 kpa to several 103 kpa the r throat obtained from a 3d image with an n edge of 600 varies within two orders of magnitude table 7 while based on the eq 19 the r c obtained by micp porosimetry varies over four orders of magnitude in a sandstone specimen for this reason to fully recover the psd or tsd of a specimen at least two images with an l voxel difference of two orders of magnitude are required the p c s hg curve derived from 20 μm l voxel sample image of gray berea sandstone specimen and the p c s hg curves derived from sample images of b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 tight sandstone specimens appear to start from s hg values that are greater than 0 table 8 that is because the n effective from these sample images is so small fig 3 d that even when several pores and throats with p c m i n are mercury invaded an obvious s hg change on the curve can be identified the p c s hg curves simulated from the 3d images exhibit deviations from the p c s hg curves measured by the actual micp porosimetries and the deviation grows with the specimen s porosity decrement table 8 the p c c curves simulated from the 3d images better fit the curves measured by the actual micp porosimetries for specimen gray berea the p c c curves simulated from the 2 μm l voxel sample images overestimate the c values while the curves simulated from the sample images with larger l voxel underestimate the c values for specimens b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 the c values are overestimated from the sample images regardless of the l voxel values 3 3 petrophysical properties it can be seen from fig 2 that the micp porosimetry derived k t values are overestimated when compared with k gas results the k t variation with r t nonetheless still shows the contribution contrast of different conductance paths to specimens permeabilities the conductance path with the largest r t of 16 5 μm in specimen gray berea has the highest k t which is about 460 times of the second highest k t there is no doubt that this largest conductance path is the only major contributor to the permeability of specimen gray berea the permeability contrasts between the largest conductance paths r t of 10 3 μm and 0 889 μm in specimen b406 s 3 and among the three largest conductance paths r t of 20 6 μm 4 11 μm and 0 387 μm in specimen x211 s 5 are not as obvious as in the specimen gray berea for this reason these conductance paths play perceptible roles in their respective conductance systems the rest of the conductance paths can be regarded as ineffective since their τ t values are too high 50 fig 3 shows the image derived petrophysical property variations with l voxel the petrophysical properties such as gas k gas and micp porosimetry derived pore throat structure parameters are lined for comparison the minimum τ t for each specimen is chosen generally these petrophysical properties change monotonically with l voxel while the regularity varies with the property type and the calculation method the total effective n total and n effective values from all sample images are smaller than the real values measured by helium pycnometer or micp porosimetry indicating a limited detectivity of the image with a single spatial resolution these values decrease with the l voxel increment fig 3 a d indicating a relatively smaller porosity contribution of the large pores and throats the trends in the image derived throat radius parameters r t h r o a t 50 and r t h r o a t m a x with l voxel are not as obvious as other petrophysical properties fig 3 e f some r t h r o a t 50 from images 10 μm and 20 μm in l voxel are inapplicable for the loss of throat information appendix 2 the r t h r o a t 50 and r t h r o a t m a x from images of gray berea sandstone specimen are smaller than those from micp porosimetry tests while the r t h r o a t 50 and r t h r o a t m a x values from images of b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 tight sandstone specimens are larger than those from micp porosimetry tests the image derived s decreases with the l voxel increment fig 3 g even the largest image derived s are at least two orders of magnitude lower than the micp porosimetry derived value the calculation of τ for some images is inapplicable for the loss of throat information appendix 2 the applicable τ value increases with the l voxel increment fig 3 h micp porosimetry derived τ t values are higher than the image derived ones the spatial resolution has different effects on permeabilities calculated through different methods both k ns and k kc values manifest decreasing trends with the l voxel increment fig 3 i j k ns values are generally lower than k gas values and k ns values from higher resolution images are closer to k gas values k kc values on the contrary are much higher than k gas values so k kc values from lower resolution images are closer to k gas values 3 4 heterogeneity the standard deviations of the petrophysical properties from images in the same l voxel are calculated to evaluate the core scale heterogeneity and its relationship with v fov fig 4 shows that the standard deviations of most petrophysical properties increase with the decrement of l voxel except r t h r o a t m a x the standard deviations of τ and k ns from 3d images of specimens b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 are inapplicable because τ and k ns themselves are inapplicable section 3 3 on the other hand the contrast between the presence and absence of these properties also indicate the heterogeneities of the specimens overall the high resolution small fov pore space images are more heterogeneous 4 discussions 4 1 origins of the resolution effects as is revealed in section 3 2 the psd and tsd detected by 3d images which were called discrete psd münch and holzer 2008 have much smaller spans than the actual psd and tsd of a sandstone specimen it is impossible to fully recover the pore throat system of the specimen via a single image based pore space reconstruction all the resolution effects originate from this shortage of single image based pore space reconstruction process for different rock types petrophysical properties and calculation methods the resolution effects and their mechanisms are not exactly the same for conventional sandstone specimen of gray berea the largest conductance path with r t of 16 5 μm contributes more than 80 of the porosity and more than 99 of the permeability the pore space of gray berea sandstone can be thereby regarded as a single porosity medium composed of only primary intergranular pores simulations of pore scale phenomena like fluid percolation can be to some extent accurate once the primary intergranular pores are correctly reconstructed although the r throat values of the whole pore system vary over four orders of magnitude the r throat values of intergranular pores vary within two orders of magnitude the pore space reconstructed from 3d images 600 in n voxel is hence reliable for petrophysical simulation as long as the image spatial resolution is chosen appropriately an image spatial resolution appropriate for one kind of simulation is however not necessarily appropriate for another kind for example the accuracy of k ns simulation depends on the recovery of the throat characteristics so the image spatial resolution should be high enough to capture all the throats of intergranular pores the accuracy of k kc calculation on the contrary rely on the porosity of intergranular pores so the image spatial resolution should be low enough to avoid counting micro porosity fig 3 for tight sandstone specimens of b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 the pores are widely distributed in a r t range from 10 2 μm to 102 μm fig 1 at least two conductance paths with great r t contrast are effective in each tight sandstone specimens whose pore spaces can be thereby considered as multi porosity media since primary intergranular pores almost disappear in these tight sandstone specimens table 5 the largest conductance paths r t 10 3 μm in specimen b406 s 3 r t 4 11 μm and 20 6 μm in specimen x211 s 5 are inferred to be composed of intragranular and grain edge fractures these microfractures have large r throat relative to other pore genetic types in the tight sandstones but they also have strong anisotropies and weak interconnectivities the strip shapes and unstable continuities make microfractures easy to penetrate a small region like the fov of a 3d image but difficult to interconnect through the whole sample for micp porosimetry some isolated microfractures are prone to be determined as effective pores in the image based calculation which is the reason that the image derived c values are higher than the micp porosimetry derived c values for the same tight sandstone specimen this also accounts for that most of the image derived k ns values and τ values of tight sandstone specimens are inapplicable but the applicable τ values derived from 3d images are even lower than the lowest τ t values thanks to their large r t and low τ t the microfractures contribute the most to the permeabilities of tight sandstones despite that very few of them get interconnected throughout the samples and contribute little to the total porosities as a consequence both the absence and the misjudgment of the effective microfractures can lead to miscalculation of k ns from 3d images the conductance paths which contribute the most to porosities r t 0 889 μm and 0 0612 μm in specimen b406 s 3 r t 0 387 μm in specimen x211 s 5 are composed of much smaller residual intergranular pores and intercrystalline pores in spite of their small r throat the high content of these small pores allows them to better interconnect with each other to constitute amounts of parallel pathways the conductance paths are hence effective and have non negligible contributions to the permeabilities of tight sandstones the reconstruction of residual intergranular pores and intercrystalline pores requires a higher resolution of the imaging device so the resolution effect and heterogeneity of tight sandstones require further research moreover smaller pores have larger quantities and surface area with the same total volume which is reflected by the fact that n total n effective and s increase with l voxel decrement but never reach the actual value measured by micp porosimetry it can be conjectured from this point that the contributions of different pore genetic types in tight sandstones are process specific for example although small pores contribute less to the hydraulic conductivity their contribution to the surface reaction is dominant because of their large specific areas peng et al 2014 4 2 pore space reconstruction strategies based on the above analysis the pore space reconstruction for a sandstone specimen should be made according to the pore throat structure of the specimen the target petrophysical property and the simulation or calculation method for conventional sandstone specimens such as gray berea the key is to accurately recover the information of primary intergranular pores the n edge should be large enough to detect the psd or tsd span of two orders of magnitude another measurement should be carried out on the specimen to acquire a reference value of the target petrophysical property the image spatial resolution can then be adjusted to calibrate the image based simulation result on the reference value high resolution images should be sampled multiple times from different positions in the specimens to overcome the heterogeneity brought by small fov if no direct measurement can be used to acquire the target petrophysical property the decisive pore throat structure parameters e g tsd in the k ns simulation should be identified first and then the alternative measurement for calibration should be found accordingly a recommendable alternative measurement is micp porosimetry from which most of the pore throat structure parameters can be acquired notice that the spatial resolution adjusted for one kind of simulation may not be suitable for another kind of simulation as for tight sandstone specimens like b406 s 3 and x211 s 5 the pore spaces are multi porosity media composed of several types of pores each of which may play a part in the simulation of a petrophysical property in this situation the optimal solution is to combine images with multiple spatial resolutions to generate a synthetical model jiang et al 2013 mehmani and prodanović 2014 prodanović et al 2015 if images with only one spatial resolution are allowed for the simulation a knowledge of the content of different pore genetic types and their contribution to the target petrophysical property is necessary to decide which pore genetic type to recover if the phenomenon to be simulated mainly happens in the intragranular and grain edge fractures a large fov would be suggested to discriminate the effective fractures throughout the sample if the target petrophysical property happens to be orientation dependent it is better to simulate in all the directions with the consideration of the anisotropy if the phenomenon mainly happens in large pore spaces or pore surfaces a high image spatial resolution is supposed to detect as much residual intergranular pores and intercrystalline pores as possible images should be sampled multiple times from different positions in case of the heterogeneity 5 conclusions the 3d pore space of three sandstone specimens with diminishing porosities are reconstructed from 3d images with escalating spatial resolutions to evaluate the resolution effect on both the conventional and the tight sandstone reservoirs high resolution images are sampled multiple times from different positions in the specimens to evaluate the core scale heterogeneities casting thin section analyses and micp porosimetries are conducted to discover the pore genetic types and pore throat structures petrophysical properties are calculated from both 3d images and micp porosimetry results for comparison it is found that the throat radius obtained from a 3d image with an edge voxel quantity of 600 changes within two orders of magnitude while the throat radius detected by micp porosimetry changes over four orders of magnitude in a sandstone specimen it is thus impossible to fully recover the pore throat system of the specimen via a single image based pore space reconstruction a too low spatial resolution will lead to the missing of small pores and throats while a too high spatial resolution will lead to the unstable detectivity of large pores for conventional sandstone specimens the pore spaces can be regarded as single porosity media composed of only primary intergranular pores the throat radius of intergranular pores mainly varies within two orders of magnitude so the reconstructed pore space is still reliable for petrophysical simulation if the spatial resolution is chosen appropriately the determination strategy of the spatial resolution is to calibrate the image derived petrophysical properties on the ones measured by other pore structure probes according to the trends in image derived petrophysical properties with the spatial resolution as for tight sandstone specimens the pore spaces are multi porosity media composed of several types of pores with throat radii varying in four orders of magnitude only one pore genetic type can be recovered via a single image based pore space reconstruction the contributions of different pore genetic types to pore scale simulations are process specific so the content of different pore genetic types and their contribution to the target petrophysical property should be investigated before choosing the spatial resolution credit authorship contribution statement xiao feng conceptualization formal analysis

are induced by an electron beam with a 130 kv voltage and 10 w power with no fluorite lens filtering kak and slaney 2001 because all the fovs are inside the specimens the accurate spatial resolutions of 2 μm 5 μm 10 μm and 20 μm in l voxel an error lower than 1 are achieved by altering the objectives for various optical magnifications shah et al 2015 and adjusting the relative positions of source sample and ccd for various cone shaped beam magnifications arns et al 2005 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 the samples are rotated in an angle of 360 3200 per projection to acquire 3200 radiographs for

and 5 μm in l voxel to reduce the intensity bias induced by the beam hardening effect 4 4 for polychromatic beams the low energy and thus strongly attenuated photons are eliminated from the beam at a faster rate than the higher weakly attenuated energy levels consequently the longer the ray paths through the object the more low energy photons are absorbed resulting in a more penetrating beam

widely used keehm and mukerji 2004 alyafei et al 2013 müter et al 2014 alyafei et al 2015 gooya et al 2016 latief et al 2017 however a binarization with a single criterion is arbitrary for an image

user to define two a priori classes the upper threshold of the unclassified range is extended toward gray values that definitely belong to a high intensity class the class assignment at an unclassified location depends on the weighted average of indicator values in its neighborhood where the weights are obtained by kriging wonho and lindquist 1999 which nevertheless cannot cope with the partial volume effects caused by blur schlüter et al 2014 in this work a watershed method vincent and soille 1991 is used for segmentation the mineral phase and the pore phase which are visually affirmed by a conservative global thresholding are pre specified as the seeds of the markers the crest lines of the markers are subsequently determined by the marker based watershed module in avizo 9

are both inlet pores and outlet pores in the effective pnm for some pns abstracted from the low resolution images either inlet pores or outlet pores are trimmed out as a consequence of the throat

simulated by assuming each throat in the pn as cylindrical in shape the capillary entry pressure p c of the throat can be thereby calculated based on the young laplace equation 15 p c 2 γ cos θ r c where γ is the mercury surface tension and given as 485 mn m θ is the mercury mercury vapor contact angle given at 130 r c is the radius of the throat for mercury to invade at p c the p c mercury

at p c permeabilities according to katz and thompson 1987 with the intrusion pressure increment mercury is forced to invade smaller and smaller pore openings until a threshold pressure p t is reached for mercury to percolate in a conduction path this conduction path is composed of pores and throats with diameters larger than the throat diameter d t corresponding to p t as the intrusion pressure further increases the mercury percolate faster and faster until the intrusion pressure is high enough for mercury to invade another conduction path under this intrusion pressure p max the hydraulic conductance of the conduction path is maximum so that the permeability of the conduction path k t can be calculated as 21 k t 1 89 d max 2 d max d t gas s hg d max where d max is the throat diameter corresponding to the p max s hg d max is the mercury saturation at d max gao and hu 2013 hu et al 2015 p t and d t were determined on the inflection point of the log differential intrusion curve when mercury starts to percolate the conductance path katz and thompson 1987 gao and hu 2013 as is seen on fig 1 there are more than one inflection points and d t on the log differential intrusion curve of a specimen which means that there are several individual conductance paths with different d t in one specimen in consideration of this an intensive sampling employed by hu et al 2018 is adopted to detect four inflection points automatically detected by software for each specimen and to calculate one k t for each conductance path pore throat structure parameters according to rootare and prenzlow

5483,river discharge data and magnitudes of floods are often not readily available for decision makers of many developing nations including colombia and this while flooding for these regions is often devastating causing many fatalities and insurmountable damage to the most vulnerable communities during the wet season in strong la niña years infrastructural damages of over us 7 2 billion have occurred mitigation of such natural disasters lacks data supported scientific approaches for evaluating river response to extreme climate events here we propose a satellite based technique to measure river discharge at selected sites for the main northern andean river the magdalena this method has the advantage of back calculating daily river discharges over a period of two decades and thus making it possible to calculate return intervals of significant flood events the study shows that satellite based river discharges well capture a the inter annual variability of river discharge b the natural seasonality of water discharge along the floodplains and c peak discharges that were observed during la niña conditions between 2008 and 2011 the last is likely more accurate compared to ground based gauging stations as ground based stations tend to overflow during large flood events and as such are hampered to accurately monitor peak discharges furthermore we show that these derived discharges can form the base to study river floodplain connectivity providing environmental decision makers with a technique that makes it possible to better monitor river and ecosystem processes keywords andes magdalena river remote sensing river discharge floodplain 1 introduction northern andean rivers have become more vulnerable to floods during recent decades restrepo and escobar 2018 restrepo et al 2018 this as the tropical drainage basins including the large magdalena river fig 1 have experienced accelerating deforestation and soil erosion rates during the 1980 2010 period restrepo and syvitski 2006 the magdalena river one of the main suppliers of sediment to the ocean 180 mt y 1 restrepo et al 2015 2006 restrepo and kjerfve 2000 has witnessed rising trends in sediment transport during the last three decades these increasing fluxes correlate well with the observed tendencies in land conversion and deforestation restrepo et al 2015 an important part of the observed increasing sediment flux is being sequestered in riverbeds and along its adjacent floodplains kettner et al 2010 restrepo and escobar 2018 making these andean rivers less resilient in regulating strong hydrologic pulses during extreme climate events in addition to human induced activities affecting soils sediment fluxes and the hydrological cycle the northern andean basins fig 1b experience high rainfall rates and associated runoff excess over steep slopes restrepo and syvitski 2006 restrepo et al 2006 also the drainage basins are influenced by the el niño southern oscillation enso which causes dry conditions during the el niño phase and periods of wet waves during la niña positive phase river discharge inter annual variability is in agreement with the el niño la niña cycle at periods of 3 5 years poveda et al 2001 2006 between 2008 and 2011 strong la niña conditions impacted the northern basins of colombia and caused economic losses of over us 7 2 billion hoyos et al 2013 during la niña event in 2011 colombia experienced the strongest floods on record flooding the country for almost three months by the so called wet wave hoyos et al 2013 river authorities and the national disaster office however lack consistent discharge data for drainage basin planning and flood hazard mitigation walschburger et al 2015 in developing countries like colombia the flood alert system is based on records of hydrological gauging stations which are often poorly calibrated and as such lack accuracy if data is made available at all restrepo et al 2006 river fluxes are underestimated when extreme discharges exceed bank full discharge in addition rating curves are not recalibrated after major floods during la niña events resulting in unreliable river discharge magnitudes milliman and farnsworth 2011 water observations in many developing countries are constrained by lack of adequate gauge stations many agencies that collect the streamflow or precipitation data are not likely to share this data with others thus the lack of in situ water data from most of the large river basins of the world implies that we can only use the readily available satellite data sets and global land model outputs the quasi global coverage provided by satellite observations combined with open data policies can help avoiding the issues related to data access and continuity lakshmi et al 2018 for the magdalena the best gauged colombian river restrepo et al 2006 most gauging data are updated and made available for users with a two year time lag therefore environmental authorities stakeholders decision makers and scientific users do not have access to near real time information of river discharge even when extreme events are unfolding as such for many river reaches satellite derived discharge estimates offer the only reliable data related to fluvial discharges and flood magnitudes therefore implementing satellite based tools for near real time estimation of river runoff provide support to river planning authorities by making data timely available to scientists and decision makers insufficient and less reliable discharge data also makes it more difficult if not impossible to establish river floodplain hydrologic connectivity relationships the momposina depression fig 1b a significant part of the magdalena floodplain that covers 10 of the catchment area is the largest avulsive river system in the northern andes and consists of the least studied fluvial lakes of major south american rivers latrubesse 2015 restrepo and escobar 2018 their ecosystem services provide refuge to aquatic biota and has the capacity to act as a buffer to downstream flooding while supplying potable and irrigation water and they are recognized as nursery areas for fish species used by artisanal fishery jaramillo villa et al 2015 however ongoing human activities along the whole basin have dramatically changed these vital but fragile ecosystems barletta et al 2010 according to preliminary environmental assessments more than 30 of the floodplain lakes along the entire magdalena river have lost their natural fluvial connection and many of those lakes as such have diminished or disappeared completely during the last two decades the nature conservancy 2016 important questions about the connectivity and hydrological functioning of these floodplains still remain unsolved including 1 how has the floodplain

are proposed to answer these questions it is evident that base line data is needed including reliable hydrologic time series to be able to analyze river floodplain connectivity during the last two decades satellite data have provided spatially and temporally dense river discharge mapping from space e g alsdorf et al 2007 bjerklie et al 2003 2005 brakenridge et al 1994 2005 2007 colin and smith 2014 gleason and smith 2014 koblinsky et al 1993 van dijk et al 2016 although these studies highlight the capabilities of satellite data to monitor river discharge available tools to monitor river flow in real time were not available until recently the dartmouth flood observatory dfo developed the first tools to estimate near real time discharge from world rivers utilizing the moderate resolution imaging spectro radiometer modis in river reaches brakenridge et al 2005 also the advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr e was utilized to obtain river flow by monitoring water surface changes along specific 10 km river reaches these satellite data applications showed that microwave sensors are accurate for monitoring rive with a daily frequency of 1 2 days with the advantage of having low interference from clouds brakenridge et al 2007 additional work has since explored further general applicability of the approach kugler et al 2019 van dijk et al 2016 over the years dfo has optimized the process of deriving river discharge from satellite data and can now estimate discharges even for ungagged rivers brakenridge et al 2012 de groeve et al 2007 by utilizing a global hydrological model the global water balance model wbm for calibration brakenridge et al 2012 currently the dartmouth flood observatory http floodobservatory colorado edu river watch version 3 5 measures river discharge in hundreds of reaches along many rivers around the world to ensure long timeseries of quasi daily data river watch stations are based on the passive microwave signals from amsr e amsr2 trmm and gpm processed in collaboration with the joint research centre jrc brakenridge et al 2012 allowing to retrieve data from january 1998 onwards de groeve et al 2007 northern andean rivers have become more vulnerable to floods during the last decades this as land use changes and deforestation have made these rivers less resilient in buffering strong hydrologic pulses during extreme climatic events river authorities and flood mitigation planning lack however adequate science supported tools for evaluating river response to extreme climate and human induced events here we use the satellite derived microwave radiometry signal as a tool for estimating near real time water discharge for the main northern andean river the magdalena stream flow timeseries during 1998 2016 were obtained and analyzed for six sites along the magdalena channel for independent and efficient evaluation of discharge variability flood magnitude estimations and river floodplain connectivity thresholds in this study we show that for large less well gauged river basins satellite based observations are useful for river planners and flood hazard mitigation efforts 2 study area drainage basins in colombia are unique andean fluvial systems due to their geographical setting near the ecuadorian border the andes mountain range divides in three parallel branches the western central and eastern cordilleras fig 1a between these cordilleras lie the magdalena river the main fluvial system in the northern andes and the main contributor of fluvial fluxes into the caribbean fig 1b restrepo and kjerfve 2000 the drainage basin covers 25 of colombia 258 437 km2 and hosts nearly 80 of the country s population the river basin consists of tributary systems with high vertical aggradation an anastomosing river pattern and subsiding foreland regions latrubesse 2015 the basin experiences natural erosion processes due to high precipitation rates annual mean of 2 500 mm steep slopes exceeding 35 and strong runoff pulses associated to la niña events restrepo and syvitski 2006 all these geomorphic conditions favor high rates of sediment supply and transport from the andes cordilleras making the magdalena river one of the top ranking world rivers in terms of sediment flux restrepo et al 2015 2006 restrepo and syvitski 2006 in addition to natural conditions favoring high rates of sediment yield restrepo et al 2006 human induced impacts such as forest clearance for cattle ranching agriculture urbanization and mining have increased sediment yield rates during the last decades e g restrepo and syvitski 2006 restrepo et al 2015 in the magdalena basin 80 of the primary forests was cleared by 2000 etter et al 2008 and lowland dry forests were eradicated by 90 etter et al 2006a b therefore not surprisingly studies of land conversion and sediment transport trends have shown that the magnitude of erosion in the northern andes has dramatically increased from 500 t km 2 y 1 to 700 t km 2 y 1 during the 2000 2010 period an increase of 30 restrepo et al 2015 human induced changes observed upstream the northern andean rivers have been also seen downstream along the floodplains fig 2 the floodplains of the magdalena river covering 10 of the catchment area are the largest fluvial fans in the northern andes and the less well studied fluvial lakes of the major south american rivers the floodplains and lakes have important ecosystems services including 50 of the freshwater fishery landings refuge of aquatic biota flood control potable and irrigation water supply and they are recognized as nursery areas for fish species used by artisan fishery jaramillo villa et al 2015 however the ongoing human activities along the whole basin have dramatically changed these vital ecosystems and fishery landings barletta et al 2010 the nature conservancy 2016 according to some preliminary environmental assessments more than 30 of the floodplain lakes have lost their natural connections to the main magdalena river and many lake systems have diminished considerable or are vanished completely during the last two decades the nature conservancy 2016 fig 2 there is no doubt that increasing trends in and pulses of upstream sediment transport have made colombian rivers less resilient to regulate strong hydrologic pulses during extreme climate events a significant part of the observed increasing fluxes of sediments is becoming sequestered in lakes and or reservoirs river channels and along the adjacent floodplains kettner et al 2010 restrepo and escobar 2018 once the magdalena river crosses the more flood prune area of the momposina depression figs 1b and 3 overflow and levee failures will become more common causing extensive flooding from april until november at the momposina depression alone sedimentation of 3 4 mm y 1 over the last 7 500 yr has formed a 130 m thick deposit bray 2006 plazas et al 1988 smith 1986 based on a sediment transport conceptual model restrepo et al 2006 found that 16 of the total annual sediment flux is deposited in the momposina floodplains alone further analysis based on landsat and modis images kettner et al 2010 calculations of sediment load restrepo and escobar 2018 and sedimentation rates at the downstream magdalena reaches plazas et al 1988 indicate that approximately 20 80 mt y 1 of sediment is deposited in the momposina depression floodplains all these mentioned environmental facts including upstream land conversion deforestation increasing trends in erosion and large amounts of sediment trapping downstream strongly indicate that the magdalena floodplains are becoming less resilient to floods due to human induced impacts and increasing pulses of sediment flux 3 methods satellite microwave sensors like trmm amsr e amsr 2 and gpm have a global coverage with a daily return period and for certain wavelengths the earth surface can be monitored despite cloud cover brakenridge et al 2005 and van dijk et al 2016 showed that by utilizing these sensors river discharge can be monitored applying similar techniques of how discharge is measured on the ground namely by measuring stage height variation in the microwave signal reflect changes of river width so as water discharge increases the width of a river increases and therefore the microwave signal changes brakenridge et al 2007 2012 the microwave data has typically a spatial resolution of 10x10km which is sufficient when located over a river to observe discharge variation over time as long as the area includes both land high emission and water surfaces low emission the data is inverse in that as water rises so the area of the water increases the total emitted radiation reduces as land surface area becomes smaller for that pixel with the use of the hydrologic model wbm the water balance model this microwave signal can be translated into a discharge recently lakshmi et al 2018 have demonstrated the application of the satellite based wbm on estimating available water in the major global river basins the authors show how the wbm can be used to estimate total water fluctuations and to compare hydrologic spatial and temporal variations across large hydrologic regions this technique has been applied for many rivers at the dartmouth flood observatory and is made semi operational through the river watch 3 5 system brakenridge et al 2012 for the magdalena river six sites fig 1b were selected for which both satellite based observations as well as ground based gauged data were obtained the ground based gauge data was obtained from the hydrological and environmental institute of colombia ideam a simple regression function is normally established between the hydrological modeled data and the satellite microwave data for this study also a regression function was established by using the ground based gauged data this to assess the model based and ground gauged based rating curves for model bias and accuracy of the riverwatch system brakenridge et al 2012 table 1 accuracy of rating curves and data from selected hydrological gauging stations were assessed in previous studies along the magdalena river e g restrepo et al 2006 kettner et al 2010 restrepo et al 2015 so to obtain timeseries of satellite derived water discharge during the 1998 2016 period fig 1c we used both modeled discharge as observed discharges and 1 established a rating curve between gauged data and the microwave data to generate daily discharges for the period of interest table 1 2 established a rating curve between modeled data and the microwave data to generate daily discharges for the period of interest 3 applied accuracy assessments and stats on how discharges are performing based on the satellite signal as compared to gauging sites table 1 and 4 improved the fitness of the rating curves through calibration equations between gauging station discharge and modeled wbm discharge after applying different lag times to assess the application of satellite derived water discharge series to identify thresholds of river floodplain connectivity we selected two different floodplain sites the barbacoas lagoon a confined floodplain in a meandering river reach and the momposina depression system an avulsive anabranching floodplain figs 1b and 3 daily near infrared aqua and true color terra moderate resolution modis satellite images were acquired for the period 2000 2017 daily images were examined during dry transition and wet seasons as well as during the monsoon la niña and el niño years pixels that over time turn black in the near infrared modis images indicate the extension of floodplain lakes surrounding the magdalena river and the momposina region while modis true color terra images were used to visualize sediment spills of the magdalena river flowing on the floodplains in order to establish at what water level and satellite based water discharge each floodplain starts to flood we constructed timeseries of different connectivity stages by using modis images derived black low turbidity and white waters higher turbid river waters as indicator four stages of connectivity were identified 1 river recharge hydrological connection to floodplain as evidenced by floods 2 channel connection between river and floodplain as evidenced by white waters 3 receding flows towards disconnection and 4 disconnection figs 3 5 and 6 according to the identified thresholds of river lagoon connectivity fig 6 percentages of connection time were calculated from frequency histograms of water level and dfo water discharge series fig 5 the main methodological steps followed in this study to estimate water discharge and river floodplain connectivity utilizing the microwave data de groeve et al 2015 are shown in fig 4 4 results 4 1 satellite timeseries of river discharge six stations along the magdalena and cauca rivers were selected for installation of new river watch measurement sites or satellite gauging sites fig 1b each site is a single 10 km square pixel within a global gridded product developed by the jrc for its global flood detection system gfds de groeve et al 2015 the morphologies of these river reaches include braided anastomosing or meandering plane forms and all have distinctive floodplains such floodplain units support considerable variations in water surface extension with changes in river flow the river watch gfds flow area sensitive signal varies between 0 84 and 0 99 at calamar a while at plato b1 the signal varies between 0 72 and 0 96 other stations including tres cruces cauca and esperanza experienced variations between 0 84 and 0 98 fig 7 a this signal is the ratio between emissivity of a pixel that represents the day s driest the 95th percentile emissivity within a 9 9 pixel array surrounding the emissivity of a selected river floodplain site this ratio is used instead of simply the measurement pixel radiance alone in order to remove temporal variation such as from land temperature affecting all of the terrain and isolate the hydrological signal at the microwave frequency used increasing in pixel coverage by surface water as compared to land produces a robust decline in measured radiance and is much stronger than that observed also by soil moisture changes brakenridge et al 2007 as expected sites located in the momposina depression floodplain such as calamar a tres cruces c1 and plato b1 showed large variability in the signal ratio during the1998 2016 period fig 7a a condition that indicates high variability in water surface area in fact the station at plato b1 displays the more accurate microwave signal after wbm calibration in contrast upstream stations with limited floodplains including esperanza b2 and cauca c2 fig 1b and 7a showed weaker satellite detection of water surface variability as clearly seen in the smaller variations of the microwave ratio value fig 7a however it was later observed that regardless the small variation in the microwave signal the values of river discharge at these stations were accurate we used wbm simulations and data from five hydrological gauging stations to obtain river discharges table 1 linear regressions and determination coefficients r2 between ground and simulated river discharges were calculated for different time lags months fig 7b regression fits improved once discharge was lagged by some months for example at calamar determination coefficient r2 between satellite data and wbm river discharge ranged from 0 10 at lag 0 months to 0 40 at a lag of 2 months indicating that the simulated river flow of the wbm model at this site is too fast wbm is a global model so such routing speed errors for individual rivers are not surprising however results in the momposina depression floodplain at plato b1 show that the satellite signal and wbm river discharge are well correlated with a coefficient r2 of 0 64 with no lag months table 1 and fig 7b in addition satellite data and river discharge from ground gauging stations are well correlated with r2 0 57 at a lag of 2 months fig 7b additional regression fits were performed at stations tres cruces c1 cauca c2 and esperanza b2 with r2 coefficients between 0 40 and 0 64 table 1 and fig 7b the rating equations obtained from the wbm based model ground based model and gauging stations at the analyzed sites fig 1b were used to convert the satellite signal to water discharge table 1 overall the inter annual variability observed at ground gauging stations is followed quite well by satellite observed river discharges fig 1c for the stations at esperanza b2 and cauca c2 the satellite signal captures well the short wave fluctuations whereas larger variations are observed in the floodplains more downstream at plato b1 and tres cruces c1 fig 1c here satellite observed river discharge follows well the observed discharges at ground gauging stations especially during high flow conditions it is worth noting that during peak discharge events the wbm rating curve overestimates the river discharge magnitudes at plato b1 station fig 1c in general simulated versus observed river discharges match quite well in the downstream floodplain stations figs 1c and 7b in the upper basin the satellite site at esperanza b2 is located in a narrow channel with limited alluvial plains downstream two major dams here the satellite signal catches well the short term fluctuations of observed ground discharges fig 1c also the upstream station at the cauca tributary c2 witnessed a good agreement between the satellite river discharges and the observed stream flows fig 1c despite its location on a constrained river reach with narrow floodplains the enso cycle is also well captured by the satellite observed discharge variability fig 1c during la niña phase 2010 2011 the magnitudes of measured discharge match well with the southern oscillation index values whereas low discharge values are observed during el niño conditions of 2015 2016 fig 1c however the upstream magdalena station at esperanza b2 does not exhibit a clear control by the enso variability because its river discharge is mainly controlled by the operation of dams to evaluate how well time series of satellite based water discharge capture the observed and measured inter annual variability related to the enso cycle we used the continuous wavelet transform cwt fig 8 restrepo et al 2014 torrence and compo 1998 the cwt function was applied on monthly gauged water discharge and satellite based discharge at plato b1 and used to visualize the periodicities and variability patterns clearly the satellite based measured discharge properly follows the annual fluctuation as well as the inter annual variability due to the enso oscillation at plato b1 the variance spectrum shows that the satellite measured discharge catches significantly better the annual fluctuation and the 2 to 4 years inter annual variability compared to ground based gauged river discharge fig 8c right 4 2 river floodplain connectivity thresholds utilizing dfo satellite data to assess the applicability of satellite derived discharge data on identifying thresholds of river floodplain connectivity we selected two different floodplain sites the barbacoas lagoon a confined floodplain system in a meandering river reach and the momposina depression an avulsive anabranching floodplain fig 1b daily near infrared aqua and true color terra moderate resolution modis satellite images were collected for those areas and analyzed for the period between 2000 and 2016 satellite based discharge data were downloaded from the dfo river watch system daily images were examined during dry transition and wet seasons as well as during la niña and el niño years since 2000 pixels that over time turn black in the near infrared modis images indicate the extension of floodplain lakes bordering the magdalena river and the momposina region while modis terra optical bands were used to visualize suspended sediment spills into adjacent lakes fig 3 we constructed timeseries of different connectivity stages by using modis images derived black non turbid and white turbid freshwaters as tracers in order to establish at what water level and therefore associated satellite derived water discharge each floodplain starts to flood four stages of connectivity were identified 1 river recharge hydrological connection to floodplain as evidenced by floods 2 channel connection between river and floodplain as evidenced by white turbid waters 3 receding flows towards disconnection and 4 disconnection figs 3 and 6 the gauged water level fluctuation is well replicated by the satellite derived water discharges in both floodplain sites barbacoas lagoon and momposina depression during neutral and la niña conditions of 2010 2013 although there are differences in the cumulative coefficient of variation fig 6 for example freshwater lakes of the momposina depression show a clear phase lag between water level and satellite based water discharges fig 6 indicating that as water level rises the water still has to pass through a more complex lagoon system before being detected thus the observed phase lag is possibly related to the hydrological dynamics of channel floodplain connections nevertheless stages of river floodplain connection visualized using daily modis satellite images were superimposed to series of water level and satellite based water discharge during la niña el niño and neutral years e g fig 3d f and 5 according to the identified thresholds of river lagoon connectivity fig 6 percentages of connection time were estimated from frequency histograms of water level and satellite based water discharge series fig 5 main statistics of water level m and satellite based water discharge m3 s 1 at barbacoas lagoon and the momposina depression floodplain during periods of la niña el niño and neutral years are shown in table 2 percentages of time of river floodplain connectivity obtained by utilizing satellite based discharges and gauging station water level are very similar indicating that once connectivity thresholds are defined for each floodplain system satellite based timeseries are a good indicator of river floodplain connectivity in addition annual flood maps developed by dfo at barbacoas lagoon and the momposina depression show that annual flood frequencies observed in channels next to the floodplains fig 9 are in agreement with estimated times of connectivity shown in table 2 however differences between flood frequencies fig 9 and time of connectivity table 2 observed during la niña years may be due to the fact that dfo flood frequency maps do not include the strongest la niña event on record in 2010 2011 or could be biased by clouds as flood frequency results are derived from modis optical bands 5 discussion and conclusions for this study we analyzed timeseries of satellite based and ground based gauging water discharge only for the period 1998 2016 figs 1c and 8 as more recent ground based data was not yet released at the time of the study nevertheless satellite based daily river discharges in near real time for the studied sites are updated and made available through the dartmouth flood observatory river watch portal http floodobservatory colorado edu dischargeaccess html river discharge estimated at ground based gauging stations is well simulated by satellite based water discharges especially at the floodplain stations such as calamar a plato b1 and tres cruces c1 where the satellite signal properly represents the natural variability of river flow along the magdalena floodplains figs 1c and 8 in addition good correlations between dfo satellite data and ground based results were observed once lags of one or two months were applied to river discharges with respect to the satellite signal table 1 and fig 7b water discharges at gauging stations are obtained from stage height variations while satellite river flow measurements are based on width variations of the water surface extension the existence of consistent lag times between station data and the satellite method requires discussion table 1 and fig 7b as noted ground stations track river discharge changes by river level stage at one location the local relation of actual discharge to stage may change over time with channel bathymetric morphology changes at the station stations are in fact often preferentially located to minimize such interference also according to the flow continuity equation q w d v stage and flow area both track only particular aspects of discharge in principle velocity may be increasing as discharge increases and a deformable river bed is eroded stage could remain constant as discharge increases hysteresis of stage discharge relations is in fact common meade 1988 flow area changes for 10 km reaches along large rivers on the other hand may exhibit lag times to incoming increasing discharge and also be relatively less affected by local channel erosion or deposition thus while stage normally increases with higher discharge the water requires time to progressively inundate the local floodplain and change the satellite signal even if overbank flow is being achieved any complex flow dynamics may be integrated in this way into the bulk water surface area measured each day and as monitored by the sensor but with some lag time as compared to river stage at one station this approach thus offers an entirely new way to monitor river flow changes and advantages and constraints that complement those posed by traditional ground gauging stations the analysis of lag times between water level data and satellite observations also requires the consideration of the seasonal hysteresis between floodplain lakes water extent and floodplain water level rudorff et al 2014 park and latrubesse 2017 this hysteresis results in dissonance in the lake local recharge and disconnection thresholds in general the water extent slowly increases during the early stages of rising water level and decreases during early falling water level in rising levels water extent starts to increase at certain water level thresholds this shows that the water extent is not sensitive to the river stage changes when the maximum water extent in floodplain is reached however water volume in the floodplain is still increasing during this period as the water from the main channel is continuously being transferred to the floodplain in general even before the river bankfull stage i e river stage when it starts to overflow the floodplain is already saturated and fully covered by water in the amazon for example water level still increases more than 3 m without changing the water extent park and latrubesse 2017 here we show the performance of satellite based discharges to assess preliminary threshold discharges so stage of river floodplain connectivity table 2 at downstream stations discharge variability and magnitudes are well captured by dfo water discharge series figs 1c and 8 table 1 the applicability of satellite based discharges is limited at locations on confined channels without floodplains in contrast the changes of water surface area in braided meandering or anastomosing channels are well correlated to satellite discharge it is well known that the discharge volume of a given river channel cross section is exceeded during peak discharge events in anabranching channels of the momposina depression floodplain characterized by lateral connectivity to floodplains a condition not necessarily related to overbank flows effective water surface area can maintain a more constant relation to discharge over longer time periods smith 1997 smith et al 1995 1996 thus for these conditions the satellite signal measures more accurately the river discharge magnitude our results clearly demonstrate the quality of satellite based water discharges along stations in the floodplains of the magdalena river fig 1c table 1 in large anabranching rivers i e amazon river and the momposina depression floodplain in the magdalena river hydro geomorphology has to be considered as part of the analysis of hydrological connectivity processes drago et al 2008 lininger and latrubesse 2016 stevaux et al 2013 in addition to the wide spectrum of the water stage variability connectivity processes are affected by the complexity of the floodplain hydro geomorphologic processes including channelized flow routing paths overbank diffusion and local recharge latrubesse 2012 park and latrubesse 2017 therefore specific studies have to be carried out in reach by reach to calibrate individual thresholds of hydrological connection disconnection levels and flood routing paths that are dependent on the internal geomorphic variability of the floodplain park and latrubesse 2017 in the magdalena floodplains further in situ studies should be conducted in order to understand how the flood pulse is related to the lateral connectivity and the specific river stage thresholds for the hydrologycal connectivity of different geomorphic units the capabilities of using satellite data to estimate magnitudes of water discharge during high flow conditions are also shown in this study during la niña positive pulses between 2008 and 2011 figs 1c and 8 peak discharges along the magdalena floodplains were well simulated by the satellite signal most likely even more precisely than those measured at hydrological gauging stations in countries like colombia many rivers are not gauged because of the intense civil conflict and the difficulty to access remote and undeveloped river regions thus remote sensing approaches are a useful tool to monitor water discharge and floodplain responses to human induced activities and climate change according to sierra et al 2017 plans to develop monitoring systems that combine satellite data with in situ measurements are currently being considered by environmental authorities however the slow political reaction to establish these monitoring programs does not allow to record current environmental changes in colombian drainage basins scientists can engage policy makers and stake holders such that hydrological monitoring is relevant to decision making processes and so environmental policies can be based on the best available scientific data salazar et al 2018 in this study we show that satellite derived water discharges are reliable data for river planners and scientists and also the support information for exploring

5483,river discharge data and magnitudes of floods are often not readily available for decision makers of many developing nations including colombia and this while flooding for these regions is often devastating causing many fatalities and insurmountable damage to the most vulnerable communities during the wet season in strong la niña years infrastructural damages of over us 7 2 billion have occurred mitigation of such natural disasters lacks data supported scientific approaches for evaluating river response to extreme climate events here we propose a satellite based technique to measure river discharge at selected sites for the main northern andean river the magdalena this method has the advantage of back calculating daily river discharges over a period of two decades and thus making it possible to calculate return intervals of significant flood events the study shows that satellite based river discharges well capture a the inter annual variability of river discharge b the natural seasonality of water discharge along the floodplains and c peak discharges that were observed during la niña conditions between 2008 and 2011 the last is likely more accurate compared to ground based gauging stations as ground based stations tend to overflow during large flood events and as such are hampered to accurately monitor peak discharges furthermore we show that these derived discharges can form the base to study river floodplain connectivity providing environmental decision makers with a technique that makes it possible to better monitor river and ecosystem processes keywords andes magdalena river remote sensing river discharge floodplain 1 introduction northern andean rivers have become more vulnerable to floods during recent decades restrepo and escobar 2018 restrepo et al 2018 this as the tropical drainage basins including the large magdalena river fig 1 have experienced accelerating deforestation and soil erosion rates during the 1980 2010 period restrepo and syvitski 2006 the magdalena river one of the main suppliers of sediment to the ocean 180 mt y 1 restrepo et al 2015 2006 restrepo and kjerfve 2000 has witnessed rising trends in sediment transport during the last three decades these increasing fluxes correlate well with the observed tendencies in land conversion and deforestation restrepo et al 2015 an important part of the observed increasing sediment flux is being sequestered in riverbeds and along its adjacent floodplains kettner et al 2010 restrepo and escobar 2018 making these andean rivers less resilient in regulating strong hydrologic pulses during extreme climate events in addition to human induced activities affecting soils sediment fluxes and the hydrological cycle the northern andean basins fig 1b experience high rainfall rates and associated runoff excess over steep slopes restrepo and syvitski 2006 restrepo et al 2006 also the drainage basins are influenced by the el niño southern oscillation enso which causes dry conditions during the el niño phase and periods of wet waves during la niña positive phase river discharge inter annual variability is in agreement with the el niño la niña cycle at periods of 3 5 years poveda et al 2001 2006 between 2008 and 2011 strong la niña conditions impacted the northern basins of colombia and caused economic losses of over us 7 2 billion hoyos et al 2013 during la niña event in 2011 colombia experienced the strongest floods on record flooding the country for almost three months by the so called wet wave hoyos et al 2013 river authorities and the national disaster office however lack consistent discharge data for drainage basin planning and flood hazard mitigation walschburger et al 2015 in developing countries like colombia the flood alert system is based on records of hydrological gauging stations which are often poorly calibrated and as such lack accuracy if data is made available at all restrepo et al 2006 river fluxes are underestimated when extreme discharges exceed bank full discharge in addition rating curves are not recalibrated after major floods during la niña events resulting in unreliable river discharge magnitudes milliman and farnsworth 2011 water observations in many developing countries are constrained by lack of adequate gauge stations many agencies that collect the streamflow or precipitation data are not likely to share this data with others thus the lack of in situ water data from most of the large river basins of the world implies that we can only use the readily available satellite data sets and global land model outputs the quasi global coverage provided by satellite observations combined with open data policies can help avoiding the issues related to data access and continuity lakshmi et al 2018 for the magdalena the best gauged colombian river restrepo et al 2006 most gauging data are updated and made available for users with a two year time lag therefore environmental authorities stakeholders decision makers and scientific users do not have access to near real time information of river discharge even when extreme events are unfolding as such for many river reaches satellite derived discharge estimates offer the only reliable data related to fluvial discharges and flood magnitudes therefore implementing satellite based tools for near real time estimation of river runoff provide support to river planning authorities by making data timely available to scientists and decision makers insufficient and less reliable discharge data also makes it more difficult if not impossible to establish river floodplain hydrologic connectivity relationships the momposina depression fig 1b a significant part of the magdalena floodplain that covers 10 of the catchment area is the largest avulsive river system in the northern andes and consists of the least studied fluvial lakes of major south american rivers latrubesse 2015 restrepo and escobar 2018 their ecosystem services provide refuge to aquatic biota and has the capacity to act as a buffer to downstream flooding while supplying potable and irrigation water and they are recognized as nursery areas for fish species used by artisanal fishery jaramillo villa et al 2015 however ongoing human activities along the whole basin have dramatically changed these vital but fragile ecosystems barletta et al 2010 according to preliminary environmental assessments more than 30 of the floodplain lakes along the entire magdalena river have lost their natural fluvial connection and many of those lakes as such have diminished or disappeared completely during the last two decades the nature conservancy 2016 important questions about the connectivity and hydrological functioning of these floodplains still remain unsolved including 1 how has the floodplain morphology changed during the last decades in terms of connectivity with the main river and its flooded areas 2 what are the hydrological dynamics of floodplains in terms of recharge water level thresholds 3 what are the spatial and temporal dynamics of suspended sediment concentration and how does these processes impact the carbon flux through the food webs in the lakes 4 how will hydropower development in the basin change river floodplain connectivity 5 how will the magdalena navigation project impact floodplain connectivity in the many river reaches in which dredging and course changes are proposed to answer these questions it is evident that base line data is needed including reliable hydrologic time series to be able to analyze river floodplain connectivity during the last two

optimized the process of deriving river discharge from satellite data and can now estimate discharges even for ungagged rivers brakenridge et al 2012 de groeve et al 2007 by utilizing a global hydrological model the global water balance model wbm for calibration brakenridge et al 2012 currently the dartmouth flood observatory http floodobservatory colorado edu river watch version 3 5 measures river discharge in hundreds of reaches along many rivers around the world to ensure long timeseries of quasi daily data river watch stations are based on the passive microwave signals from amsr e amsr2 trmm and gpm processed in collaboration with the joint research centre jrc brakenridge et al 2012 allowing to retrieve data from january 1998 onwards de groeve et al 2007 northern andean rivers have become more vulnerable to floods during the last decades this as land use changes and deforestation have made these rivers less resilient in buffering strong hydrologic pulses during extreme climatic events river authorities and flood mitigation planning lack however adequate science supported tools for evaluating river response to extreme climate and human induced events here we use the satellite derived microwave radiometry signal as a tool for estimating near real time water discharge for the main northern andean river the magdalena stream flow timeseries during 1998 2016 were obtained and analyzed for six sites along the magdalena channel for independent and efficient evaluation of discharge variability flood magnitude estimations and river floodplain connectivity thresholds in this study we show that for large less well gauged river basins satellite based observations are useful for river planners and flood hazard mitigation efforts 2 study area drainage basins in colombia are unique andean fluvial systems due to their geographical setting near the ecuadorian border the andes mountain range divides in three parallel branches the western central and eastern cordilleras fig 1a between these cordilleras lie the magdalena river the main fluvial system in the northern andes and the main contributor of fluvial fluxes into the caribbean fig 1b restrepo and kjerfve 2000 the drainage basin covers 25 of colombia 258 437 km2 and hosts nearly 80 of the country s population the river basin consists of tributary systems with high vertical aggradation an anastomosing river pattern and subsiding foreland regions latrubesse 2015 the basin experiences natural erosion processes due to high precipitation rates annual mean of 2 500 mm steep slopes exceeding 35 and strong runoff pulses associated to la niña events restrepo and syvitski 2006 all these geomorphic conditions favor high rates of sediment supply and transport from the andes cordilleras making the magdalena river one of the top ranking world rivers in terms of sediment flux restrepo et al 2015 2006 restrepo and syvitski 2006 in addition to natural conditions favoring high rates of sediment yield restrepo et al 2006 human induced impacts such as forest clearance for cattle ranching agriculture urbanization and mining have increased sediment yield rates during the last decades e g restrepo and syvitski 2006 restrepo et al 2015 in the magdalena basin 80 of the primary forests was cleared by 2000 etter et al 2008 and lowland dry forests were eradicated by 90 etter et al 2006a b therefore not surprisingly studies of land conversion and sediment transport trends have shown that the magnitude of erosion in the northern andes has dramatically increased from 500 t km 2 y 1 to 700 t km 2 y 1 during the 2000 2010 period an increase of 30 restrepo et al 2015 human induced changes observed upstream the northern andean rivers have been also seen downstream along the floodplains fig 2 the floodplains of the magdalena river covering 10 of the catchment area are the largest fluvial fans in the northern andes and the less well studied fluvial lakes of the major south american rivers the floodplains and lakes have important ecosystems services including 50 of the freshwater fishery landings refuge of aquatic biota flood control potable and irrigation water supply and they are recognized as nursery areas for fish species used by artisan fishery jaramillo villa et al 2015 however the ongoing human activities along the whole basin have dramatically changed these vital ecosystems and fishery landings barletta et al 2010 the nature conservancy 2016 according to some preliminary environmental assessments more than 30 of the floodplain lakes have lost their natural connections to the main magdalena river and many lake systems have diminished considerable or are vanished completely during the last two decades the nature conservancy 2016 fig 2 there is no doubt that increasing trends in and pulses of upstream sediment transport have made colombian rivers less resilient to regulate strong hydrologic pulses during extreme climate events a significant part of the observed increasing fluxes of sediments is becoming sequestered in lakes and or reservoirs river channels and along the adjacent floodplains kettner et al 2010 restrepo and escobar 2018 once the magdalena river crosses the more flood prune area of the momposina depression figs 1b and 3 overflow and levee failures will become more common causing extensive flooding from april until november at the momposina depression alone sedimentation of 3 4 mm y 1 over the last 7 500 yr has formed a 130 m thick deposit bray 2006 plazas et al 1988 smith 1986 based on a sediment transport conceptual model restrepo et al 2006 found that 16 of the total annual sediment flux is deposited in the momposina floodplains alone further analysis based on landsat and modis images kettner et al 2010 calculations of sediment load restrepo and escobar 2018 and sedimentation rates at the downstream magdalena reaches plazas et al 1988 indicate that approximately 20 80 mt y 1 of sediment is deposited in the momposina depression floodplains all these mentioned environmental facts including upstream land conversion deforestation increasing trends in erosion and large amounts of sediment trapping downstream strongly indicate that the magdalena floodplains are becoming less resilient to floods due to human induced impacts and increasing pulses of sediment flux 3 methods satellite microwave sensors like trmm amsr e amsr 2 and gpm have a global coverage with a daily return period and for certain wavelengths the earth surface can be monitored despite cloud cover brakenridge et al 2005 and van dijk et al 2016 showed that by utilizing these sensors river discharge can be monitored applying similar techniques of how discharge is measured on the ground namely by measuring stage height variation in the microwave signal reflect changes of river width so as water discharge increases the width of a river increases and therefore the microwave signal changes brakenridge et al 2007 2012 the microwave data has typically a spatial resolution of 10x10km which is sufficient when located over a river to observe discharge variation over time as long as the area includes both land high emission and water surfaces low emission the data is inverse in that as water rises so the area of the water increases the total emitted radiation reduces as land surface area becomes smaller for that pixel with the use of the hydrologic model wbm the water balance model this microwave signal can be translated into a discharge recently lakshmi et al 2018 have demonstrated the application of the satellite based wbm on estimating available water in the major global river basins the authors show how the wbm can be used to estimate total water fluctuations and to compare hydrologic spatial and temporal variations across large hydrologic regions this technique has been applied for many rivers at the dartmouth flood observatory and is made semi operational through the river watch 3 5 system brakenridge et al 2012 for the magdalena river six sites fig 1b were selected for which both satellite based observations as well as ground based gauged data were obtained the ground based gauge data was obtained from the hydrological and environmental institute of colombia ideam a simple regression function is normally established between the hydrological modeled data and the satellite microwave data for this study also a regression function was established by using the ground based gauged data this to assess the model based and ground gauged based rating curves for model bias and accuracy of the riverwatch system brakenridge et al 2012 table 1 accuracy of rating curves and data from selected hydrological gauging stations were assessed in previous studies along the magdalena river e g restrepo et al 2006 kettner et al 2010 restrepo et al 2015 so to obtain timeseries of satellite derived water discharge during the 1998 2016 period fig 1c we used both modeled discharge as observed discharges and 1 established a rating curve between gauged data and the microwave data to generate daily discharges for the period of interest table 1 2 established a rating curve between modeled data and the microwave data to generate daily discharges for the period of interest 3 applied accuracy assessments and stats on how discharges are performing based on the satellite signal as compared to gauging sites table 1 and 4 improved the fitness of the rating curves through calibration equations between gauging station discharge and modeled wbm discharge after applying different lag times to assess the application of satellite derived water discharge series to identify thresholds of river floodplain connectivity we selected two different floodplain sites the barbacoas lagoon a confined floodplain in a meandering river reach and the momposina depression system an avulsive anabranching floodplain figs 1b and 3 daily near infrared aqua and true color terra moderate resolution modis satellite images were acquired for the period 2000 2017 daily images were examined during dry transition and wet seasons as well as during the monsoon la niña and el niño years pixels that over time turn black in the near infrared modis images indicate the extension of floodplain lakes surrounding the magdalena river and the momposina region while modis true color terra images were used to visualize sediment spills of the magdalena river flowing on the floodplains in order to establish at what water level and satellite based water discharge each floodplain starts to flood we constructed timeseries of different connectivity stages by using modis images derived black low turbidity and white waters higher turbid river waters as indicator four stages of connectivity were identified 1 river recharge hydrological connection to floodplain as evidenced by floods 2 channel connection between river and floodplain as evidenced by white waters 3 receding flows towards disconnection and 4 disconnection figs 3 5 and 6 according to the identified thresholds of river lagoon connectivity fig 6 percentages of connection time were calculated from frequency histograms of water level and dfo water discharge series fig 5 the main methodological steps followed in this study to estimate water discharge and river floodplain connectivity utilizing the microwave data de groeve et al 2015 are shown in fig 4 4 results 4 1 satellite timeseries of river discharge six stations along the magdalena and cauca rivers were selected for installation of new river watch measurement sites or satellite gauging sites fig 1b each site is a single 10 km square pixel within a global gridded product developed by the jrc for its global flood detection system gfds de groeve et al 2015 the morphologies of these river reaches include braided anastomosing or meandering plane forms and all have distinctive floodplains such floodplain units support considerable variations in water surface extension with changes in river flow the river watch gfds flow area sensitive signal varies between 0 84 and 0 99 at calamar a while at plato b1 the signal varies between 0 72 and 0 96 other stations including tres cruces cauca and esperanza experienced variations between 0 84 and 0 98 fig 7 a this signal is the ratio between emissivity of a pixel that represents the day s driest the 95th percentile emissivity within a 9 9 pixel array surrounding the emissivity of a selected river floodplain site this ratio is used instead of simply the measurement pixel radiance alone in order to remove temporal variation such as from land temperature affecting all of the terrain and isolate the hydrological signal at the microwave frequency used increasing in pixel coverage by surface water as compared to land produces a robust decline in measured radiance and is much stronger than that observed also by soil moisture changes brakenridge et al 2007 as expected sites located in the momposina depression floodplain such as calamar a tres cruces c1 and plato b1 showed large variability in the signal ratio during the1998 2016 period fig 7a a condition that indicates high variability in water surface area in fact the station at plato b1 displays the more accurate microwave signal after wbm calibration in contrast upstream stations with limited floodplains including esperanza b2 and cauca c2 fig 1b and 7a showed weaker satellite detection of water surface variability as clearly seen in the smaller variations of the microwave ratio value fig 7a however it was later observed that regardless the small variation in the microwave signal the values of river discharge at these stations were accurate we used wbm simulations and data from five hydrological gauging stations to obtain river discharges table 1 linear regressions and determination coefficients r2 between ground and simulated river discharges were calculated for different time lags months fig 7b regression fits improved once discharge was lagged by some months for example at calamar determination coefficient r2 between satellite data and wbm river discharge ranged from 0 10 at lag 0 months to 0 40 at a lag of 2 months indicating that the simulated river flow of the wbm model at this site is too fast wbm is a global model so such routing speed errors for individual rivers are not surprising however results in the momposina depression floodplain at plato b1 show that the satellite signal and wbm river discharge are well correlated with a coefficient r2 of 0 64 with no lag months table 1 and fig 7b in addition satellite data and river discharge from ground gauging stations are well correlated with r2 0 57 at a lag of 2 months fig 7b additional regression fits were performed at stations tres cruces c1 cauca c2 and esperanza b2 with r2 coefficients between 0 40 and 0 64 table 1 and fig 7b the rating equations obtained from the wbm based model ground based model and gauging stations at the analyzed sites fig 1b were used to convert the satellite signal to water discharge table 1 overall the inter annual variability observed at ground gauging stations is followed quite well by satellite observed river discharges fig 1c for the stations at esperanza b2 and cauca c2 the satellite signal captures well the short wave fluctuations whereas larger variations are observed in the floodplains more downstream at plato b1 and tres cruces c1 fig 1c here satellite observed river discharge follows well the observed discharges at ground gauging stations especially during high flow conditions it is worth noting that during peak discharge events the wbm rating curve overestimates the river discharge magnitudes at plato b1 station fig 1c in general simulated versus observed river discharges match quite well in the downstream floodplain stations figs 1c and 7b in the upper basin the satellite site at esperanza b2 is located in a narrow channel with limited alluvial plains downstream two major dams here the satellite signal catches well the short term fluctuations of observed ground discharges fig 1c also the upstream station at the cauca tributary c2 witnessed a good agreement between the satellite river discharges and the observed stream flows fig 1c despite its location on a constrained river reach with narrow floodplains the enso cycle is also well captured by the satellite observed discharge variability fig 1c during la niña phase 2010 2011 the magnitudes of measured discharge match well with the southern oscillation index values whereas low discharge values are observed during el niño conditions of 2015 2016 fig 1c however the upstream magdalena station at esperanza b2 does not exhibit a clear control by the enso variability because its river discharge is mainly controlled by the operation of dams to evaluate how well time series of satellite based water discharge capture the observed and measured inter annual variability related to the enso cycle we used the continuous wavelet transform cwt fig 8 restrepo et al 2014 torrence and compo 1998 the cwt function was applied on monthly gauged water discharge and satellite based discharge at plato b1 and used to visualize the periodicities and variability patterns clearly the satellite based measured discharge properly follows the annual fluctuation as well as the inter annual variability due to the enso oscillation at plato b1 the variance spectrum shows that the satellite measured discharge catches significantly better the annual fluctuation and the 2 to 4 years inter annual variability compared to ground based gauged river discharge fig 8c right 4 2 river floodplain connectivity thresholds utilizing dfo satellite data to assess the applicability of satellite derived discharge data on identifying thresholds of river floodplain connectivity we selected two different floodplain sites the barbacoas lagoon a confined floodplain system in a meandering river reach and the momposina depression an avulsive anabranching floodplain fig 1b daily near infrared aqua and true color terra moderate resolution modis satellite images were collected for those areas and analyzed for the period between 2000 and 2016 satellite based discharge data were downloaded from the dfo river watch system daily images were examined during dry transition and wet seasons as well as during la niña and el niño years since 2000 pixels that over time turn black in the near infrared modis images indicate the extension of floodplain lakes bordering the magdalena river and the momposina region while modis terra optical bands were used to visualize suspended sediment spills into adjacent lakes fig 3 we constructed timeseries of different connectivity stages by using modis images derived black non turbid and white turbid freshwaters as tracers in order to establish at what water level and therefore associated satellite derived water discharge each floodplain starts to flood four stages of connectivity were identified 1 river recharge hydrological connection to floodplain as evidenced by floods 2 channel connection between river and floodplain as evidenced by white turbid waters 3 receding flows towards disconnection and 4 disconnection figs 3 and 6 the gauged water level fluctuation is well replicated by the satellite derived water discharges in both floodplain sites barbacoas lagoon and momposina depression during neutral and la niña conditions of 2010 2013 although there are differences in the cumulative coefficient of variation fig 6 for example freshwater lakes of the momposina depression show a clear phase lag between water level and satellite based water discharges fig 6 indicating that as water level rises the water still has to pass through a more complex lagoon system before being detected thus the observed phase lag is possibly related to the hydrological dynamics of channel floodplain connections nevertheless stages of river floodplain connection visualized using daily modis satellite images were superimposed to series of water level and satellite based water discharge during la niña el niño and neutral years e g fig 3d f and 5 according to the identified thresholds of river lagoon connectivity fig 6 percentages of connection time were estimated from frequency histograms of water level and satellite based water discharge series fig 5 main statistics of water level m and satellite based water discharge m3 s 1 at barbacoas lagoon and the momposina depression floodplain during periods of la niña el niño and neutral years are shown in table 2 percentages of time of river floodplain connectivity obtained by utilizing satellite based discharges and gauging station water level are very similar indicating that once connectivity thresholds are defined for each floodplain system satellite based timeseries are a good indicator of river floodplain connectivity in addition annual flood maps developed by dfo at barbacoas lagoon and the momposina depression show that annual flood frequencies observed in channels next to the floodplains fig 9 are in agreement with estimated times of connectivity shown in table 2 however differences between flood frequencies fig 9 and time of connectivity table 2 observed during la niña years may be due to the fact that dfo flood frequency maps do not include the strongest la niña event on record in 2010 2011 or could be biased by clouds as flood frequency results are derived from modis optical bands 5 discussion and conclusions for this study we analyzed timeseries of satellite based and ground based gauging water discharge only for the period 1998 2016 figs 1c and 8 as more recent ground based data was not yet released at the time of the study nevertheless satellite based daily river discharges in near real time for the studied sites are updated and made available through the dartmouth flood observatory river watch portal http floodobservatory colorado edu dischargeaccess html river discharge estimated at ground based gauging stations is well simulated by satellite based water discharges especially at the floodplain stations such as calamar a plato b1 and tres cruces c1 where the satellite signal properly represents the natural variability of river flow along the magdalena floodplains figs 1c and 8 in addition good correlations between dfo satellite data and ground based results were observed once lags of one or two months were applied to river discharges with respect to the satellite signal table 1 and fig 7b water discharges at gauging stations are obtained from stage height variations while satellite river flow measurements are based on width variations of the water surface extension the existence of consistent lag times between station data and the satellite method requires discussion table 1 and fig 7b as noted ground stations track river discharge changes by river level stage at one location the local relation of actual discharge to stage may change over time with channel bathymetric morphology changes at the station stations are in fact often preferentially located to minimize such interference also according to the flow continuity equation q w d v stage and flow area both track only particular aspects of discharge in principle velocity may be increasing as discharge increases and a deformable river bed is eroded stage could remain constant as discharge increases hysteresis of stage discharge relations is in fact common meade 1988 flow area changes for 10 km reaches along large rivers on the other hand may exhibit lag times to incoming increasing discharge and also be relatively less affected by local channel erosion or deposition thus while stage normally increases with higher discharge the water requires time to progressively inundate the local floodplain and change the satellite signal even if overbank flow is being achieved any complex flow dynamics may be integrated in this way into the bulk water surface area measured each day and as monitored by the sensor but with some lag time as compared to river stage at one station this approach thus offers an entirely new way to monitor river flow changes and advantages and constraints that complement those posed by traditional ground gauging stations the analysis of lag times between water level data and satellite observations also requires the consideration of the seasonal hysteresis between floodplain lakes water extent and floodplain water level rudorff et al 2014 park and latrubesse 2017 this hysteresis results in dissonance in the lake local recharge and disconnection thresholds in general the water extent slowly increases during the early stages of rising water level and decreases during early falling water level in rising levels water extent starts to increase at certain water level thresholds this shows that the water extent is not sensitive to the river stage changes when the maximum water extent in floodplain is reached however water volume in the floodplain is still increasing during this period as the water from the main channel is continuously being transferred to the floodplain in general even before the river bankfull stage i e river stage when it starts to overflow the floodplain is already saturated and fully covered by water in the amazon for example water level still increases more than 3 m without changing the water extent park and latrubesse 2017 here we show the performance of satellite based discharges to assess preliminary threshold discharges so stage of river floodplain connectivity table 2 at downstream stations discharge variability and magnitudes are well captured by dfo water discharge series figs 1c and 8 table 1 the applicability of satellite based discharges is limited at locations on confined channels without floodplains in contrast the changes of water surface area in braided meandering or anastomosing channels are well correlated to satellite discharge it is well known that the discharge volume of a given river channel cross section is exceeded during peak discharge events in anabranching channels of the momposina depression floodplain characterized by lateral connectivity to floodplains a condition not necessarily related to overbank flows effective water surface area can maintain a more constant relation to discharge over longer time periods smith 1997 smith et al 1995 1996 thus for these conditions the satellite signal measures more accurately the river discharge magnitude our results clearly demonstrate the quality of satellite based water discharges along stations in the floodplains of the magdalena river fig 1c table 1 in large anabranching rivers i e amazon river and the momposina depression floodplain in the magdalena river hydro geomorphology has to be considered as part of the analysis of hydrological connectivity processes drago et al 2008 lininger and latrubesse 2016 stevaux et al 2013 in addition to the wide spectrum of the water stage variability connectivity processes are affected by the complexity of the floodplain hydro geomorphologic processes including channelized flow routing paths overbank diffusion and local recharge latrubesse 2012 park and latrubesse 2017 therefore specific studies have to be carried out in reach by reach to calibrate individual thresholds of hydrological connection disconnection levels and flood routing paths that are dependent on the internal geomorphic variability of the floodplain park and latrubesse 2017 in the magdalena floodplains further in situ studies should be conducted in order to understand how the flood pulse is related to the lateral connectivity and the specific river stage thresholds for the hydrologycal connectivity of different geomorphic units the capabilities of using satellite data to estimate magnitudes of water discharge during high flow conditions are also shown in this study during la niña positive pulses between 2008 and 2011 figs 1c and 8 peak discharges along the magdalena floodplains were well simulated by the satellite signal most likely even more precisely than those measured at hydrological gauging stations in countries like colombia many rivers are not gauged because of the intense civil conflict and the difficulty to access remote and undeveloped river regions thus remote sensing approaches are a useful tool to monitor water discharge and floodplain responses to human induced activities and climate change according to sierra et al 2017 plans to develop monitoring systems that combine satellite data with in situ measurements are currently being considered by environmental authorities however the slow political reaction to establish these monitoring programs does not allow to record current environmental changes in colombian drainage basins scientists can engage policy makers and stake holders such that hydrological monitoring is relevant to decision making processes and so environmental policies can be based on the best available scientific data salazar et al 2018 in this study we show that satellite derived water discharges are reliable data for river planners and scientists and also the support information for exploring

5484,the strong elevation gradient of the himalaya allows for investigation of altitude and orographic impacts on surface water δ 18o and δd stable isotope values this study differentiates the time and altitude variable contributions of source waters to the arun river in eastern nepal it provides isotope data along a 5000 m gradient collected from tributaries as well as groundwater snow and glacial sourced surface waters and time series data from april to october 2016 we find nonlinear trends in δ 18o and δd lapse rates with high elevation lapse rates 4000 6000 masl 5 7 times more negative than low elevation lapse rates 1000 3000 masl a distinct seasonal signal in δ 18o and δd lapse rates indicates time variable source water contributions from glacial and snow meltwater as well as precipitation transitions between the indian summer monsoon and winter westerly disturbances deuterium excess correlates with the extent of snowpack and tracks melt events during the indian summer monsoon season our analysis identifies the influence of snow and glacial melt waters on river composition during low flow conditions before the monsoon april may 2016 followed by a 5 week transition to the indian summer monsoon sourced rainfall around mid june 2016 in the post monsoon season we find continued influence from glacial melt waters as well as ism sourced groundwater keywords stable isotopes himalaya glacier snow precipitation seasonality 1 introduction stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen δ 18o and δd and their spatiotemporal variation in surface water provide a unique tracer to characterize contributions of different water sources including seasonal precipitation snowmelt and glacial melt aggarwal et al 2006 gat 2010 kendall and mcdonnell 2012 differences in δ 18o and δd values emerge from fractionations occurring during water vapor transport and precipitation which are correlated to altitude latitude precipitation intensity and distance from the moisture source in addition post deposition fractionation from evaporation in soil and sublimation in snow fields can modify the isotopic composition of surface and groundwaters dansgaard 1964 gat 2010 in high mountain regions distinguishing the δ 18o and δd values of different water sources that contribute to stream flow is complicated by the extreme effects of topographic rise seasonal changes in water vapor sources melting of snow fields and glaciers and difficulties in accessing high altitude regions the differences in δ 18o and δd values among sources contributing to streamflow can be exploited to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of water supply in the himalaya and to characterize regional climatic processes in the himalaya the combination of decreasing temperatures and increasing rainout with increasing elevation accentuates fractionation processes and results in water that is isotopically lighter depleted in 18o and 2h relative to vmsow this relationship reported as δ 18o and δd lapse rates ranges in surface water in himalayan rivers from 0 45 to 4 4 km 1 for δ 18o and 8 3 to 33 0 km 1 for δd but these estimates largely draw on surface water samples from streams in low and mid elevations less than 5000 m florea et al 2017 hren et al 2009 meese et al 2018 poage and chamberlain 2001 racoviteanu et al 2013 van der veen et al 2018 varay et al 2017 wilson et al 2016 high elevation samples are sparse but essential to accurately characterize mountain sourced surface waters especially in regions with significant contributions from isotopically heavy snow and glacial melt river water is commonly used to construct δ 18o and δd lapse rates however river water does not represent the true precipitation δ 18o and δd values but instead reflects an integrated signal of upstream processes and source waters that vary seasonally critically δ 18o and δd lapse rates derived from mountainous regions are often used in paleoclimate and regional climate modeling caves et al 2015 poage and chamberlain 2001 these analyses often depend on the δ 18o and δd values preserved in minerals in the sedimentary record which may be influenced by seasonal variations in moisture source and assume a linear relationship between δ 18o or δd and altitude in addition to elevation the distinct moisture regimes in the himalaya the indian summer monsoon ism and winter westerly disturbances wwd control surface water and precipitation isotopic signatures due to the source path and precipitation intensity of the two storm systems the ism originates in the bay of bengal and indian ocean and moves across the indian subcontinent before intersecting with the himalayan orographic barrier bookhagen and burbank 2010 wwd moisture originates in the mediterranean black and caspian seas and follows a continental path across the middle east and central asia before reaching the western edge of the himalaya barry 2008 cannon et al 2015 lang and barros 2004 the bulk of ism precipitation falls as rain from june to september while wwd precipitation is deposited as snowpack from december to april barry 2008 bookhagen and burbank 2010 lang and barros 2004 deuterium excess d excess is a tool to measure kinetic fractionation effects related to humidity moisture recycling and post deposition processes including sublimation dansgaard 1964 froehlich et al 2002 pfahl and sodemann 2014 broadly deuterium excess relates the proportion of 18o and 2h contained in water these proportions are controlled by the physical conditions at the source of precipitation i e humidity air temperature and sea surface temperature as well as the conditions during water vapor transport i e mixing and evaporation of different sources froehlich et al 2002 given the different conditions at the origin and storm pathways of the ism versus wwd precipitation the two moistures regimes can be expected to have distinct deuterium excess signatures in the himalaya precipitation from the ism is marked by low deuterium excess values while wwd sourced precipitation has relatively high deuterium excess values balestrini et al 2016 bershaw et al 2012 hren et al 2009 jeelani et al 2013 pande et al 2000 previous studies of surface water isotope signatures in the himalaya largely sampled in the post monsoon season and reflect a dominant ism moisture source and little is known about the temporal evolution of surface water oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope values driven by seasonal moisture source variation particularly the influence of seasonal snowmelt grujic et al 2018 hren et al 2009 meese et al 2018 van der veen et al 2018 varay et al 2017 this study based in the arun river basin in eastern nepal captures the temporal and spatial variability in δ 18o and δd values of river water driven by seasonal ism and wwd moisture sources as well as the influence of different melt waters it targets the pre and post monsoon seasons which represent base flow conditions when himalayan rivers are not flushed with runoff from the ism in order to assess the importance of snow melt glacial melt and groundwater on river water δ 18o and δd values with minimal influence from mixing with rain water accordingly we analyze data from water samples sourced from tributaries with varying amounts of snowmelt glacial melt and groundwater this study contributes to a growing understanding of the sources and timing of water contributions at low and mid elevations and offers δ 18o and δd data from elevations above 5000 m where few samples have been collected previously in the past models of δ 18o and δd depletion at high elevation relied on linear regression models to extrapolate isotope values from low and mid elevations we show that there are strong nonlinear changes in the δ 18o and δd values of water contributions to the arun river catchment driven by high elevation surface water influenced by snow and glacial melt waters as well as variability in seasonal moisture source 2 study

contains 15 glacierized area and is estimated to receive 25 of annual streamflow from wwd sourced snowmelt and 70 from ism sourced rainfall bookhagen and burbank 2010 rgi consortium 2017 we collected data from two sub basins of the arun river the barun khola and the sabha khola fig 1 the barun khola is a 468 km2 watershed with a mean catchment elevation of 4758 m above sea level masl and 30

confluence of the sabha khola and arun river is located near tumlingtar combined the barun and sabha kholas span from 200 m to 8480 m at the summit of mt makalu the relief of the region allows for dense sampling over a wide range of elevations while minimizing changes in latitude and longitude high elevation regions in the himalaya are known to have different moisture regimes and seasonal changes in water source driven by ism and wwd precipitation as well as melt water inputs from snow and glaciers immerzeel et al 2013 mölg et al 2014 smith and bookhagen 2018 the spatiotemporal variation in oxygen and hydrogen isotope values in the barun and sahba kholas allow us to explore the elevation fingerprint on δ 18o and δd values as well as the potential applications of these isotopic tracers to parse surface water sources based on previous studies from the region we anticipate that the barun khola will exhibit isotopically depleted δ 18o and δd values as well as higher deuterium excess values relative to the sabha khola due to its higher average catchment elevation greater contributions from wwd derived snowmelt and seasonal glacier melt as such this 6000 m elevation gradient will also highlight variability in river water δ 18o and δd lapse rates that may be driven by catchment effects related to mixing water sources and as well as elevation effects dutton et al 2005 3 data and methods we used a synoptic sampling approach to characterize spatial variation in δ 18o and δd values in the sabha and barun kholas during two field campaigns baraer et al 2009 mark et al 2005 wilson et al 2016 pre monsoon sampling was conducted during april and may 2016 with repeat sampling at the same locations during october and november 2016 see table 1 the shoulder periods of the monsoon were targeted to characterize river isotopic composition under base flow conditions when glacier and snowmelt as well as groundwater are important contributors to river discharge with minimal or no influence from recent rainfall events during the summer season orographic effects on ism rainfall dominate river discharge and its isotopic composition but access for sampling is greatly restricted when possible river samples were collected from the main stem of the barun khola and sabha khola every 200 m of elevation gain n 28 13 season samples were also collected from surface water drainages that contained extensive snowpack n 22 11 season proglacial lakes n 4 2 season debris covered glaciers n 6 3 season as well as groundwater sourced springs and surface water tributaries draining from forested and agriculture dominated areas n 56 28 season snowmelt and glacial melt samples were collected as close to the snow line or glacial terminus as possible and therefore represent an integrated value of melt sources upstream of the sample collection point groundwater sourced samples labeled collectively as groundwater in fig 1 were collected in two ways 1 from springs via locally constructed catch boxes and 2 from surface water tributaries sourced exclusively from rainfall fed subsurface flow no glacier or snowmelt inputs groundwater samples collected from springs drain from small hillslopes were not mechanically pumped from depth and likely reflect shallow subsurface groundwater whereas groundwater samples collected from surface water tributaries integrate groundwater sources from larger drainage areas and likely represent a combination of shallow and deep groundwater sources local nepali schoolteachers were trained to collect time series samples at the confluence of the barun and sabha kholas with the arun river at barun bazaar and tumlingtar respectively samples were collected every 4 days from late april early may through october 2016 n 41 for the sabha khola n 45 for barun khola two sets of water samples were collected from each site each sample was filtered through 0 45 μm glass filters into 30 ml polyethylene nalgene bottles that were rinsed three times with filtered water bottles were filled completely to produce a positive meniscus sealed tightly and wrapped with tape to prevent the formation of air bubbles and possible evaporation before laboratory analysis bottles were stored in a dark place until the completion of the field season and then stored in a refrigerator at 4 c at uc santa barbara during the pre and post monsoon synoptic sampling campaigns additional field duplicates were collected every 10 samples for error analysis samples were analyzed for δ 18o and δd at the german research center for geosciences gfz organic surface geochemistry lab with a picarro l 2140i laser spectrometer isotope values for δ 18o δd and deuterium excess are reported in delta notation as parts per thousand as related to their deviation from vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow precision for δ 18o and δd measurements was 0 03 and 0 3 respectively analytical uncertainties for the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope measurements are reported as standard deviation of triplicate measurements in table 1 deuterium excess was calculated for each sample as d δd 8 δ 18o dansgaard 1964 data for individual samples are listed in table 1 the mean catchment elevation of the drainage area contributing to each sample location was calculated using nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm global 1 arc second dataset for asia srtmgl1 nasa jpl 2013 the drainage area was defined using the watershed toolbox with esri s arcgis based on gps coordinates of the samples recorded during the field campaigns to supplement the isotope interpretation snow extent was calculated for the pre and post monsoon seasons two landsat 8 oli images with minimal cloud cover were selected from the beginning march 24th 2016 and end november 11th 2016 of the synoptic sampling campaigns regions of interest were selected for each image to conduct a supervised classification using maximum likelihood classification the classification output was validated and adjusted to ensure accurate representation of snow extent weekly averaged land surface temperatures for the barun khola were calculated from the modis terra land surface temperature daily global 1 km gridded data mod11a1 product for the duration of the time series data april through november 2016 to provide further insight to climate processes during the

khola and sahba khola basins with precipitation data from the u s geological survey and uc santa barbara climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps dataset funk et al 2015 4 results 4 1 oxygen and hydrogen isotope values and lapse rates river sample δ 18o and δd values in the barun khola and sabha khola show a distinct elevation fingerprint with a clear depletion effect that strengthens at higher elevations figs 2 and 3 in both the barun and sabha kholas δ 18o and δd values in the post monsoon season are isotopically heavy relative to the pre monsoon season on average water samples collected in the sabha khola watershed are notably lighter in isotopic values relative to the barun khola see table 1 in the barun khola the post monsoon δ 18o and δd lapse rates of the river samples 6 0 0 4 km 1 and 49 8 3 2 km 1 respectively are relatively weaker than the pre monsoon signal 6 7 1 4 km 1 and 54 8 12 0 km 1 in contrast the pre monsoon δ 18o and δd lapse rates in the sabha khola 1 3 0 3 km 1 and 8 0 2 8 km 1 are weaker than the post monsoon lapse rates 1 4 0 1 km 1 and 9 5 1 0 km 1 the gap from 3000 to 4000 m is a consequence of inaccessible terrain in the lower reaches of the barun khola when all river samples are combined the lapse rates for the δ 18o and δd are 2 2 0 2 km 1 and 17 4 2 0 km 1 in the pre monsoon season and 2 4 0 2 km 1 and 19 0 1 4 km 1 in the post monsoon season the regressions comparing δ 18o and δd to altitude are statistically significant p 0 01 and the coefficients of determination r2 of the ordinary least squares ols regressions strengthen between the pre and post monsoon seasons the lapse rates of δ 18o and δd from glacial melt and groundwater show a significant p 0 1 relationship with altitude whereas samples from snowmelt are inconclusive p 0 1 see inset figs 2 and 3 the low r2 and p values in the snowmelt samples are indicative of greater variability which may reflect sublimation processes influencing these samples additional weighted regression results using a bisquare weight parameter are reported in table 3 deuterium excess values also exhibit a distinct elevation relationship fig 4 they are positively correlated in mean catchment elevations up to 3000 m and then switch to a negative correlation after 4000 m in the pre monsoon season the deuterium excess lapse rate of the river samples is 2 3 0 9 km 1 in the barun khola with mean catchment drainage elevations ranging from 4000 m to 6000 m and 2 0 0 2 km 1 in the sabha khola with mean catchment elevations between 350 m and 3000 m in the post monsoon season the elevation influence weakens to 1 9 0 3 km 1 in higher elevation catchments and 1 5 0 6 km 1 in lower elevation catchments groundwater sourced samples both from springs and surface tributaries exhibit a significant relationship between deuterium excess and elevation p values 0 1 however snow and glacial melt sourced samples have no significant relationship to further elucidate the relationship between precipitation moisture source and deuterium excess we compare the change in snow covered area of the drainage basins for samples in the pre and post monsoon seasons with the difference in deuterium excess across seasons fig 5 since snow in the region is largely sourced from wwd we would expect a large change in deuterium excess values across seasons indicative of a moisture source transition from wwd to ism sourced precipitation indeed there is a clear relationship between loss of snowpack and decreased deuterium excess values from the pre to post monsoon seasons 4 2 temporal variation in deuterium excess deuterium excess exhibits a distinct temporal signal from late april to october in both the barun khola and sabha khola fig 6 from late april to early june during the onset of the monsoon deuterium excess values increase until 4 june 2016 at which point they decline until 14 july 2016 and stabilize for the duration of the time series deuterium excess values in the sabha khola are lower than the barun khola throughout the time series with the exception of a large drop in deuterium excess values in the barun khola in early september temperatures in the barun khola which best represent high elevation regions where snowmelt may be occurring are relatively high and stable until early june then decrease until mid july with a sudden increase in temperatures in late august the surface temperature declines through september and remains stable but relatively low until mid october the rainfall data indicate sparse rainfall during may and more continuous rainfall from june to september that then diminish in october 5 discussion 5 1 δ18o and δd lapse rates are strongly controlled by elevation and water sources through targeted sampling in low and high elevation watersheds replicated across the pre and post monsoon seasons we find nonlinear trends in δ 18o and δd stable isotope lapse rates of river samples that are strongly controlled by elevation and mixing of source waters i e snowmelt glacial melt and groundwater the seasonal transition in precipitation from wwd snowmelt to ism rainfall acts as an additional control on δ 18o and δd lapse rates and is reflected in the groundwater and snowmelt sourced samples with less influence on glacial melt samples given the terrain of the region samples collected in the barun khola encompassed a nearly 4 km vertical range over a 33 km horizontal path while sabha khola samples covered a 1 2 km elevation rise within a 25 km path this dense sampling approach should minimize the influence of variables other than elevation but when we compare the pre and post monsoon data there is evidence that stable isotope lapse rates are highly variable across seasons suggesting controls beyond elevation specifically our results point to the influence of the catchment effect and the fingerprint of moisture source transitions especially the role of seasonal snowmelt on river water δ 18o and δd values in the barun khola the weakening lapse rates in river samples from the pre to post monsoon season are mirrored in the weakening signal and depletion of δ 18o and δd values in the glacier and snowmelt sourced samples figs 2 and 3 snowmelt sourced samples have a relatively lower δ 18o and δd elevation relationship and exhibit more variability across the pre to post monsoon season compared to the glacier and river samples which is likely because these samples experience a distinct transition in moisture source across seasons from wwd snowpack to ism sourced groundwater additionally in the pre monsoon season the snowmelt samples are marked with greater standard deviation among the collected samples relative to river glacial or even groundwater samples and this variability is likely driven by the highly dynamic sublimation and melt processes in a snowfield gat 2010 from the pre to post monsoon season the depletion in the barun khola s δ 18o and δd values as well as the greater r2 values of the isotope altitude relationship reflects a shift from snowmelt and glacial melt sourced streamflow to ism sourced groundwater and glacial melt in the post monsoon after most or all snowpack has melted smith and bookhagen 2018 in the lower elevation sites in the sabha khola where there is no glacial contribution and snowmelt is minimal the δ 18o and δd lapse rates increase from the pre to post monsoon season which may reflect a transition from deeper subsurface flow in the pre monsoon season to recent elevation controlled ism rainfall inputs in the post monsoon season this transition is reflected in the δ 18o and δd lapse rates of the two types of groundwater samples samples collected from groundwater fed surface water tributaries which likely integrate shallow and deeper groundwater have more variation across seasons and reflect the isotopic signature of recent ism rainfall more than the spring samples which likely drain only shallow groundwater and are influenced by evaporation driven fractionation notably the δ 18o and δd lapse rates of the groundwater samples and the sabha khola river samples are similar which implies an overlap in source waters between the sabha khola and local groundwater the δ 18o and δd lapse rates in both the sabha and barun kholas validate the catchment effect described in dutton et al 2005 and fill their articulated need posed by dutton et al 2005 to investigate the potential non linearity of δ 18o and δd lapse rates at high elevations our isotope lapse rates most closely align with van der veen et al 2018 whose data also exhibit nonlinear δd lapse rates that strengthen around 4000 m elevation in the western himalaya and racoviteanu et al 2013 whose study includes high elevation snow samples from the eastern himalaya fig 7 and details in table 2 varay et al 2017 demonstrate a strengthening of δ 18o and δd lapse rates from the pre to post monsoon season in the low elevation tons and yamuna watersheds in the western himalaya while the δ 18o and δd lapse rate in the higher elevation sutlej basin remains relatively stable across seasons in general studies from the west and central himalaya report δ 18o and δd lapse rates that are notably weaker than those found in our study we attribute the differences in δ 18o and δd lapse rates to the paucity of high elevation data the spatial coverage of our sampling approach the west to east gradient in snow coverage and snow water equivalents immerzeel et al 2009 smith and bookhagen 2018 as well as increased contribution of δ 18o and δd depleted glacier and snowmelt to surface water at high elevation sites these factors emerge as clear controls on δ 18o and δd lapse rates when we compare studies across the himalayan front fig 7 to a lesser extent interannual variability in the strength of the ism or wwds as related to teleconnections with the el niño southern oscillation may also influence the strength of the δ 18o and δd lapse rates by augmenting the magnitude of the rainout effect cannon et al 2015 gadgil et al 2004 broadly we know that sites in the western himalaya have stronger wwd influence than the east whereas the eastern himalaya sites have a stronger ism influence than the west bookhagen and burbank 2010 lang and barros 2004 this relative influence of wwd versus ism precipitation is reflected in regional patterns of δ 18o and δd lapse rates fig 7 with the steepest lapse rates occurring in large basins with relatively greater snowpack from the wwd and drainage areas that include headwaters in the tibetan plateau where the ism influence is weaker than the wwd indeed several other studies note that δ 18o and δd lapse rates derived from surface waters in high altitude regions are strongly influenced by complex precipitation patterns driven by varying influence of the ism versus wwd post depositional processes in snowpack and seasonal glacial melt hren et al 2009 poage and chamberlain 2001 our data document strong non linear δ 18o and δd lapse rates in the eastern himalaya a region with reduced wwd influence compared to the western himalaya where non linear lapse rates have also been suggested van der veen et al 2018 δ 18o and δd lapse rates are used as inputs to paleoclimate and modern climate reconstructions however as indicated by our results there are significant differences in the magnitude of the δ 18o and δd lapse rates across seasons which is likely driven by transitions between the ism and wwd precipitation regimes paleoclimate reconstructions often rely on pedogenic stable oxygen δ 18o values for the analysis and assume linear lapse rates along an elevation gradient florea et al 2017 argue that groundwater more accurately reflects the true precipitation δ 18o and δd lapse rate however our study indicates that even groundwater δ 18o and δd values are not fully conservative and reflect distinct seasonal transitions in moisture source this seasonal variability is reinforced in bershaw et al 2012 who note that δ 18o and δd values reflect distinct precipitation sources and local meteorological processes along elevation transects of the himalayan and the tibetan plateau our results support concerns raised by hren et al 2009 that the assumption of linear δ 18o and δd lapse rates will lead to misinterpretation of paleoclimatic or paleoenvironmental change we suggest that the sensitivity of δ 18o and δd lapse rates to seasonal precipitation patterns can be used to improve the application of δ 18o and δd lapse rates in paleoclimate and modern climate analyses 5 2 deuterium excess as a tracer for seasonal moisture source transitions deuterium excess emerges as a useful tool to investigate the variation in δ 18o and δd values driven by precipitation patterns and seasonal moisture source transitions altitude controls on deuterium excess fig 4 may reflect two distinct processes 1 increased evaporation and moisture recycling in lower elevations and 2 post depositional processes such as sublimation in the higher elevation regions smith and bookhagen 2018 average deuterium excess values for wwd sourced water are relatively high 15 whereas ism sourced water averages are lower 8 12 gat and carmi 1970 hren et al 2009 the pre monsoon samples in the barun khola that drain snowmelt dominated basins mean catchment elevations between 4000 and 5000 m align with average wwd deuterium excess values whereas the post monsoon samples more closely resemble the ism fig 4 indicating a distinct transition and mixing of moisture sources across seasons jeelani et al 2013 melting and refreezing of snow will further accentuate the elevated deuterium excess values found in drainage basins dominated by snowmelt as compared to basins dominated by glacial melt cooper 1998 taylor et al 2002 as expected the majority of deuterium excess values from samples collected in the sabha khola in both the pre and post monsoon seasons fall within the average range of ism deuterium excess values with the exception of river samples collected from the headwaters of the sabha khola which have snowpack from wwd precipitation and exhibit elevated deuterium excess values compared to the rest of the basin there is a clear correlation between loss of snowpack from pre to post monsoon season and decreased deuterium excess values fig 5 which provides further evidence of a transition in moisture sourced from continental sourced wwd precipitation with relatively high deuterium excess values in the pre monsoon season to marine sourced ism precipitation in the post monsoon season with relatively lower deuterium excess values glacier melt samples exhibit almost no variation in deuterium excess values across seasons reinforcing our hypothesis that high deuterium excess is an indicator specific to wwd sourced precipitation in the region river samples which integrate snowmelt glacial melt and groundwater sources decrease from the pre to post monsoon season indicating shift in discharge sourced from wwd sourced snowmelt to ism sourced rainfall these results complement previous studies across the himalaya that found similar patterns in deuterium excess linked to precipitation moisture sources in the himalaya in a broad survey across the himalaya and tibetan plateau hren et al 2009 notes that deuterium excess values are strongly correlated to elevation and longitude providing a distinct tracer for water vapor transported from the bay of bengal indian ocean and westerly derived continental sources van der veen et al 2018 notes a transition in deuterium excess lapse rates at 4200 m in the sutlej river in the western himalaya a shift from 1 5 km 1 below 4200 m to 3 0 km 1 above 4200 m that correlates to increased snowpack in the high elevation regions of the watershed the deuterium excess breakpoint does not exist in the alaknanda basin about 350 km to the east of the sutlej which receives less snowpack and is a lower elevation catchment considered in tandem with the spatial variability of wwd derived snowpack across the himalaya fig 7 these results predict increased seasonal variation in deuterium excess and isotope values as we move westward along the himalayan front building from the results of our synoptic sampling campaign the time series data fig 6 show increasing deuterium excess values at the onset of the monsoon indicating increased contributions from high deuterium excess continental sourced wwd snowpack to river discharge and is associated with surface temperatures greater than 0 c snow melt dominates the water budget until early june at which point the contributing source to streamflow transitions to lower deuterium excess marine sourced ism rainfall eventually stabilizing around mid july when ism rainfall dominates the water supply in both catchments both the barun and sabha khola time series data include peaks in deuterium excess at the onset of the monsoon in may and june fig 6 two processes could explain these peaks first the rivers may be flushed with snowmelt at the onset of the monsoon driven by a combination of increasing temperature and rain on snow melting events smith and bookhagen 2018 wulf et al 2012 second the peaks could indicate mixing with pre monsoon rainfall events which based on balestrini et al 2016 s study in the khumbu region may have elevated deuterium excess values this is particularly true in the sabha khola where deuterium excess values in early monsoon rainfall events could be further elevated due to high humidity increased evaporation and moisture recycling with local water vapor either of these processes alone or a combination of the two could drive the peaks in deuterium excess at the monsoon onset the decline in deuterium excess values in the barun khola in early september is most likely associated with a pulse of low deuterium excess glacial melt water following high temperatures throughout august see fig s1 6 conclusions our results indicate that δ 18o and δd lapse rates strengthen in the high elevation eastern himalaya regions the δ 18o and δd lapse rates derived from river water are controlled by the relative influence of source waters groundwater snowmelt and glacial melt as well as regional climate processes particularly seasonally variable precipitation sourced from the ism and wwd and as such are temporally variable on interannual time scales notably we find greater variability in the δ 18o and δd values of river water samples in the pre monsoon season when snowmelt contributes to high elevation rivers and groundwater is the dominant source in the low elevation rivers in the post monsoon season the δ 18o and δd values of river water are depleted relative to the pre monsoon and reflect the anticipated depletion associated with the rainout effect from a long monsoon season our data indicate that δ 18o and δd lapse rates derived from river water draining from catchments with mean elevations greater than 4 km are 5 7 times more negative than the δ 18o and δd lapse rates calculated from river water samples with basin elevations below 3 km these results may influence the interpretation of paleoclimate and paleoelevation records and reinforce the need for additional high elevation sampling campaigns from areas with high relief in the himalaya as evidenced in the time series data the unique seasonal variability of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes can be exploited to track individual hydro metrological events see also balestrini et al 2016 in the khumbu and van der veen et al 2018 in northwest india additional studies from other regions of the himalaya that capture the variability in the strength of the ism or wwd and incorporate sampling sites from rivers with varying contributions from snowmelt glacial melt groundwater and rainfall are needed to further validate the spatiotemporal patterns described here by targeting low flow periods before and after the monsoon we derive new insights on the utility of isotopic tracers to assess base flow from meltwaters and groundwater contributing to himalayan rivers in small and mid sized catchments such as the barun khola and sabha khola rivers are ungauged and in situ meteorological data are nonexistent our data highlight the timing of snowmelt events and can be used to broadly assess the potential impacts of glacial retreat seasonal and interannual variability in snowpack and regional shifts in the intensity and timing of the ism and wwd on the composition of himalayan rivers bolch et al 2012 cannon et al 2015 malik et al 2016 these results contribute to a growing body of work from the himalaya and andes see hill et al 2018 that utilize oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope tracers particularly deuterium excess to define the spatiotemporal indicators of rain snow and glacial meltwaters and groundwater to assess seasonal fluxes in high

5484,the strong elevation gradient of the himalaya allows for investigation of altitude and orographic impacts on surface water δ 18o and δd stable isotope values this study differentiates the time and altitude variable contributions of source waters to the arun river in eastern nepal it provides isotope data along a 5000 m gradient collected from tributaries as well as groundwater snow and glacial sourced surface waters and time series data from april to october 2016 we find nonlinear trends in δ 18o and δd lapse rates with high elevation lapse rates 4000 6000 masl 5 7 times more negative than low elevation lapse rates 1000 3000 masl a distinct seasonal signal in δ 18o and δd lapse rates indicates time variable source water contributions from glacial and snow meltwater as well as precipitation transitions between the indian summer monsoon and winter westerly disturbances deuterium excess correlates with the extent of snowpack and tracks melt events during the indian summer monsoon season our analysis identifies the influence of snow and glacial melt waters on river composition during low flow conditions before the monsoon april may 2016 followed by a 5 week transition to the indian summer monsoon sourced rainfall around mid june 2016 in the post monsoon season we find continued influence from glacial melt waters as well as ism sourced groundwater keywords stable isotopes himalaya glacier snow precipitation seasonality 1 introduction stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen δ 18o and δd and their spatiotemporal variation in surface water provide a unique tracer to characterize contributions of different water sources including seasonal precipitation snowmelt and glacial melt aggarwal et al 2006 gat 2010 kendall and mcdonnell 2012 differences in δ 18o and δd values emerge from fractionations occurring during water vapor transport and precipitation which are correlated to altitude latitude precipitation intensity and distance from the moisture source in addition post deposition fractionation from evaporation in soil and sublimation in snow fields can modify the isotopic composition of surface and groundwaters dansgaard 1964 gat 2010 in high mountain regions distinguishing the δ 18o and δd values of different water sources that contribute to stream flow is complicated by the extreme effects of topographic rise seasonal changes in water vapor sources melting of snow fields and glaciers and difficulties in accessing high altitude regions the differences in δ 18o and δd values among sources contributing to streamflow can be exploited to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of water supply in the himalaya and to characterize regional climatic processes in the himalaya the combination of decreasing temperatures and increasing rainout with increasing elevation accentuates fractionation processes and results in water that is isotopically lighter depleted in 18o and 2h relative to vmsow this relationship reported as δ 18o and δd lapse rates ranges in surface water in himalayan rivers from 0 45 to 4 4 km 1 for δ 18o and 8 3 to 33 0 km 1 for δd but these estimates largely draw on surface water samples from streams in low and mid elevations less than 5000 m florea et al 2017 hren et al 2009 meese et al 2018 poage and chamberlain 2001 racoviteanu et al 2013 van der veen et al 2018 varay et al 2017 wilson et al 2016 high elevation samples are sparse but essential to accurately characterize mountain sourced surface waters especially in regions with significant contributions from isotopically heavy snow and glacial melt river water is commonly used to construct δ 18o and δd lapse rates however river water does not represent the true precipitation δ 18o and δd values but instead reflects an integrated signal of upstream processes and source waters that vary seasonally critically δ 18o and δd lapse rates derived from mountainous regions are often used in paleoclimate and regional climate modeling caves et al 2015 poage and chamberlain 2001 these analyses often depend on the δ 18o and δd values preserved in minerals in the sedimentary record which may be influenced by seasonal variations in moisture source and assume a linear relationship between δ 18o or δd and altitude in addition to elevation the distinct moisture regimes in the himalaya the indian summer monsoon ism and winter westerly disturbances wwd control surface water and precipitation isotopic signatures due to the source path and precipitation intensity of the two storm systems the ism originates in the bay of bengal and indian ocean and moves across the indian subcontinent before intersecting with the himalayan orographic barrier bookhagen and burbank 2010 wwd moisture originates in the mediterranean black and caspian seas and follows a continental path across the middle east and central asia before reaching the western edge of the himalaya barry 2008 cannon et al 2015 lang and barros 2004 the bulk of ism precipitation falls as rain from june to september while wwd precipitation is deposited as snowpack from december to april barry 2008 bookhagen and burbank 2010 lang and barros 2004 deuterium excess d excess is a tool to measure kinetic fractionation effects related to humidity moisture recycling and post deposition processes including sublimation dansgaard 1964 froehlich et al 2002 pfahl and sodemann 2014 broadly deuterium excess relates the proportion of 18o and 2h contained in water these proportions are controlled by the physical conditions at the source of precipitation i e humidity air temperature and sea surface temperature as well as the conditions during water vapor transport i e mixing and evaporation of different sources froehlich et al 2002 given the different conditions at the origin and storm pathways of the ism versus wwd precipitation the two moistures regimes can be expected to have distinct deuterium excess signatures in the himalaya precipitation from the ism is marked by low deuterium excess values while wwd sourced precipitation has relatively high deuterium excess values balestrini et al 2016 bershaw et al 2012 hren et al 2009 jeelani et al 2013 pande et al 2000 previous studies of surface water isotope signatures in the himalaya largely sampled in the post monsoon season and reflect a dominant ism moisture source and little is known about the temporal evolution of surface water oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope values driven by seasonal moisture source variation particularly the influence of seasonal snowmelt grujic et al 2018 hren et al 2009 meese et al 2018 van der veen et al 2018 varay et al 2017 this study based in the arun river basin in eastern nepal captures the temporal and spatial variability in δ 18o and δd values of river water driven by seasonal ism and wwd moisture sources as well as the influence of different melt waters it targets the pre and post monsoon seasons which represent base flow conditions when himalayan rivers are not flushed with runoff from the ism in order to assess the importance of snow melt glacial melt and groundwater on river water δ 18o and δd values with minimal influence from mixing with rain water accordingly we analyze data from water samples sourced from tributaries with varying amounts of snowmelt glacial melt and groundwater this study contributes to a growing understanding of the sources and timing of water contributions at low and mid elevations and offers δ 18o and δd data from elevations above 5000 m where few samples have been collected previously in the past models of δ 18o and δd depletion at high elevation relied on linear regression models to extrapolate isotope values from low and mid elevations we show that there are strong nonlinear changes in the δ 18o and δd values of water contributions to the arun river catchment driven by high elevation surface water influenced by snow and glacial melt waters as well as variability in seasonal moisture source 2 study site the arun valley receives precipitation from both the ism and wwd and exhibits one of the steepest elevation gradients in the eastern himalaya 200 m to 8480 m in altitude the 33 000 km2 arun river contains 15 glacierized area and is estimated to receive 25 of annual streamflow from wwd sourced snowmelt and 70 from ism sourced rainfall bookhagen and burbank 2010 rgi consortium 2017 we collected data from two sub basins of the arun river the barun khola and the sabha khola fig 1 the barun khola is a 468 km2 watershed with a mean catchment elevation of 4758 m above sea level masl and 30 glaciated area fig 1a the confluence of the barun khola with the arun river is at barun bazaar the sabha khola is a 549 km2 non glacierized watershed with a mean elevation of 1503 masl fig 1b the confluence of the sabha khola and arun river is located near tumlingtar combined the barun and sabha kholas span from 200 m to 8480 m at the summit of mt makalu the relief of the region allows for dense sampling over a wide range of elevations while minimizing changes in latitude and longitude high elevation regions in the himalaya are known to have different moisture regimes and seasonal changes in water source driven by ism and wwd precipitation as well as melt water inputs from snow and glaciers immerzeel et al 2013 mölg et al 2014 smith and bookhagen 2018 the spatiotemporal variation in oxygen and hydrogen isotope values in the barun and sahba kholas allow us to explore the elevation fingerprint on δ 18o and δd values as well as the potential applications of these isotopic tracers to parse surface water sources based on previous studies from the region we anticipate that the barun khola will exhibit isotopically depleted δ 18o and δd values as well as higher deuterium excess values relative to the sabha khola due to its higher average catchment elevation greater contributions from wwd derived snowmelt and seasonal glacier melt as such this 6000 m elevation gradient will also highlight variability in river water δ 18o and δd lapse rates that may be driven by catchment effects related to mixing water sources and as well as elevation effects dutton et al 2005 3 data and methods we used a synoptic sampling approach to characterize spatial variation in δ 18o and δd values in the sabha and barun kholas during two field campaigns baraer et al 2009 mark et al 2005 wilson et al 2016 pre monsoon sampling was conducted during april and may 2016 with repeat sampling at the same locations during october and november 2016 see table 1 the shoulder periods of the monsoon were targeted to characterize river isotopic composition under base flow conditions when glacier and snowmelt as well as groundwater are important contributors to river discharge with minimal or no influence from recent rainfall events during the summer season orographic effects on ism rainfall dominate river discharge and its isotopic composition but access for sampling is greatly restricted when possible river samples were collected from the main stem of the barun khola and sabha khola every 200 m of elevation gain n 28 13 season samples were also collected from surface water drainages that contained extensive snowpack n 22 11 season proglacial lakes n 4 2 season debris covered glaciers n 6 3 season as well as groundwater sourced springs and surface water tributaries draining from forested and agriculture dominated areas n 56 28 season snowmelt and glacial melt samples were collected as close to the snow line or glacial terminus as possible and therefore represent an integrated value of melt sources upstream of the sample collection point groundwater sourced samples labeled collectively as groundwater in fig 1 were collected in two ways 1 from springs via locally constructed catch boxes and 2 from surface water tributaries sourced exclusively from rainfall fed subsurface flow no glacier or snowmelt inputs groundwater samples collected from springs drain from small hillslopes were not mechanically pumped from depth and likely reflect shallow subsurface groundwater whereas groundwater samples collected from surface water tributaries integrate groundwater sources from larger drainage areas and likely represent a combination of shallow and deep groundwater sources local nepali schoolteachers were trained to collect time series samples at the confluence of the barun and sabha kholas with the arun river at barun bazaar and tumlingtar respectively samples were collected every 4 days from late april early may through october 2016 n 41 for the sabha khola n 45 for barun khola two sets of water samples were collected from each site each sample was filtered through 0 45 μm glass filters into 30 ml polyethylene nalgene bottles that were rinsed three times with filtered water bottles were filled completely to produce a positive meniscus sealed tightly and wrapped with tape to prevent the formation of air bubbles and possible evaporation before laboratory analysis bottles were stored in a dark place until the completion of the field season and then stored in a refrigerator at 4 c at uc santa barbara during the pre and post monsoon synoptic sampling campaigns additional field duplicates were collected every 10 samples for error analysis samples were analyzed for δ 18o and δd at the german research center for geosciences gfz organic surface geochemistry lab with a picarro l 2140i laser spectrometer isotope values for δ 18o δd and deuterium excess are reported in delta notation as parts per thousand as related to their deviation from vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow precision for δ 18o and δd measurements was 0 03 and 0 3 respectively analytical uncertainties for the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope measurements are reported as standard deviation of triplicate measurements in table 1 deuterium excess was calculated for each sample as d δd 8 δ 18o dansgaard 1964 data for individual samples are listed in table 1 the mean catchment elevation of the drainage area contributing to each sample location was calculated using nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm global 1 arc second dataset for asia srtmgl1 nasa jpl 2013 the drainage area was defined using the watershed toolbox with esri s arcgis based on gps coordinates of the samples recorded during the field campaigns to supplement the isotope interpretation snow extent was calculated for the pre and post monsoon seasons two landsat 8 oli images with minimal cloud cover were selected from the beginning march 24th 2016 and end november 11th 2016 of the synoptic sampling campaigns regions of interest were selected for each image to conduct a supervised classification using maximum likelihood classification the classification output was validated and adjusted to ensure accurate representation of snow extent weekly averaged land surface temperatures for the barun khola were calculated from the modis terra

results 4 1 oxygen and hydrogen isotope values and lapse rates river sample δ 18o and δd values in the barun khola and sabha khola show a distinct elevation fingerprint with a clear depletion effect that strengthens at higher elevations figs 2 and 3 in both the barun and sabha kholas δ 18o and δd values in the post monsoon season are isotopically heavy relative to the pre monsoon season on average water samples collected in the sabha khola watershed are notably lighter in isotopic values relative to the barun khola see table 1 in the barun khola the post monsoon δ 18o and δd lapse rates of the river samples 6 0 0 4 km 1 and 49 8 3 2 km 1 respectively are relatively weaker than the pre monsoon signal 6 7 1 4 km 1 and 54 8 12 0 km 1 in contrast the pre monsoon δ 18o and δd lapse rates in the sabha khola 1 3 0 3 km 1 and 8 0 2 8 km 1 are weaker than the post monsoon lapse rates 1 4 0 1 km 1 and 9 5 1 0 km 1 the gap from 3000 to 4000 m is a consequence of inaccessible terrain in the lower reaches of the barun khola when all river samples are combined the lapse rates for the δ 18o and δd are 2 2 0 2 km 1 and 17 4 2 0 km 1 in the pre monsoon season and 2 4 0 2 km 1 and 19 0 1 4 km 1 in the post monsoon season the regressions comparing δ 18o and δd to altitude are statistically significant p 0 01 and the coefficients of determination r2 of the ordinary least squares ols regressions strengthen between the pre and post monsoon seasons the lapse rates of δ 18o and δd from glacial melt and groundwater show a significant p 0 1 relationship with altitude whereas samples from snowmelt are inconclusive p 0 1 see inset figs 2 and 3 the low r2 and p values in the snowmelt samples are indicative of greater variability which may reflect sublimation processes influencing these samples additional weighted regression results using a bisquare weight parameter are reported in table 3 deuterium excess values also exhibit a distinct elevation relationship fig 4 they are positively correlated in mean catchment elevations up to 3000 m and then switch to a negative correlation after 4000 m in the pre monsoon season the deuterium excess lapse rate of the river samples is 2 3 0 9 km 1 in the barun khola with mean catchment drainage elevations ranging from 4000 m to 6000 m and 2 0 0 2 km 1 in the sabha khola with mean catchment elevations between 350 m and 3000 m in the post monsoon season the elevation influence weakens to 1 9 0 3 km 1 in higher elevation catchments and 1 5 0 6 km 1 in lower elevation catchments groundwater sourced samples both from springs and surface tributaries exhibit a significant relationship between deuterium excess and elevation p values 0 1 however snow and glacial melt sourced samples have no significant relationship to further elucidate the relationship between precipitation moisture source and deuterium excess we compare the change in snow covered area of the drainage basins for samples in the pre and post monsoon seasons with the difference in deuterium excess across seasons fig 5 since snow in the region is largely sourced from wwd we would expect a large change in deuterium excess values across seasons indicative of a moisture source transition from wwd to ism sourced precipitation indeed there is a clear relationship between loss of snowpack and decreased deuterium excess values from the pre to post monsoon seasons 4 2 temporal variation in deuterium excess deuterium excess exhibits a distinct temporal signal from late april to october in both the barun khola and sabha khola fig 6 from late april to early june during the onset of the monsoon deuterium excess values increase until 4 june 2016 at which point they decline until 14 july 2016 and stabilize for the duration of the time series deuterium excess values in the sabha khola are lower than the barun khola throughout the time series with the exception of a large drop in deuterium excess values in the barun khola in early september temperatures in the barun khola which best represent high elevation regions where snowmelt may be occurring are relatively high and stable until early june then decrease until mid july with a sudden increase in temperatures in late august the surface temperature declines through september and remains stable but relatively low until mid october the rainfall data indicate sparse rainfall during may and more continuous rainfall from june to september that then diminish in october 5 discussion 5 1 δ18o and δd lapse rates are strongly controlled by elevation and water sources through targeted sampling in low and high elevation watersheds replicated across the pre and post monsoon seasons we find nonlinear trends in δ 18o and δd stable isotope lapse rates of river samples that are strongly controlled by elevation and mixing of source waters i e snowmelt glacial melt and groundwater the seasonal transition in precipitation from wwd snowmelt to ism rainfall acts as an additional control on δ 18o and δd lapse rates and is reflected in the groundwater and snowmelt sourced samples with less influence on glacial melt samples given the terrain of the region samples collected in the barun khola encompassed a nearly 4 km vertical range over a 33 km horizontal path while sabha khola samples covered a 1 2 km elevation rise within a 25 km path this dense sampling approach should minimize the influence of variables other than elevation but when we compare the pre and post monsoon data there is evidence that stable isotope lapse rates are highly variable across seasons suggesting controls beyond elevation specifically our results point to the influence of the catchment effect and the fingerprint of moisture source transitions especially the role of seasonal snowmelt on river water δ 18o and δd values in the barun khola the weakening lapse rates in river samples from the pre to post monsoon season are mirrored in the weakening signal and depletion of δ 18o and δd values in the glacier and snowmelt sourced samples figs 2 and 3 snowmelt sourced samples have a relatively lower δ 18o and δd elevation relationship and exhibit more variability across the pre to post monsoon season compared to the glacier and river samples which is likely because these samples experience a distinct transition in moisture source across seasons from wwd snowpack to ism sourced groundwater additionally in the pre monsoon season the snowmelt samples are marked with greater standard deviation among the collected samples relative to river glacial or even groundwater samples and this variability is likely driven by the highly dynamic sublimation and melt processes in a snowfield gat 2010 from the pre to post monsoon season the depletion in the barun khola s δ 18o and δd values as well as the greater r2 values of the isotope altitude relationship reflects a shift from snowmelt and glacial melt sourced streamflow to ism sourced groundwater and glacial melt in the post monsoon after most or all snowpack has melted smith and bookhagen 2018 in the lower elevation sites in the sabha khola where there is no glacial contribution and snowmelt is minimal the δ 18o and δd lapse rates increase from the pre to post monsoon season which may reflect a transition from deeper subsurface flow in the pre monsoon season to recent elevation controlled ism rainfall inputs in the post monsoon season this transition is reflected in the δ 18o and δd lapse rates of the two types of groundwater samples samples collected from groundwater fed surface water tributaries which likely integrate shallow and deeper groundwater have more variation across seasons and reflect the isotopic signature of recent ism rainfall more than the spring samples which likely drain only shallow groundwater and are influenced by evaporation driven fractionation notably the δ 18o and δd lapse rates of the groundwater samples and the sabha khola river samples are similar which implies an overlap in source waters between the sabha khola and local groundwater the δ 18o and δd lapse rates in both the sabha and barun kholas validate the catchment effect described in dutton et al 2005 and fill their articulated need posed by dutton et al 2005 to investigate the potential non linearity of δ 18o and δd lapse rates at high elevations our isotope lapse rates most closely align with van der veen et al 2018 whose data also exhibit nonlinear δd lapse rates that strengthen around 4000 m elevation in the western himalaya and racoviteanu et al 2013 whose study includes high elevation snow samples from the eastern himalaya fig 7 and details in table 2 varay et al 2017 demonstrate a strengthening of δ 18o and δd lapse rates from the pre to post monsoon season in the low elevation tons and yamuna watersheds in the western himalaya while the δ 18o and δd lapse rate in the higher elevation sutlej basin remains relatively stable across seasons in general studies from the west and central himalaya report δ 18o and δd lapse rates that are notably weaker than those found in our study we attribute the differences in δ 18o and δd lapse rates to the paucity of high elevation data the spatial coverage of our sampling approach the west to east gradient in snow coverage and snow water equivalents immerzeel et al 2009 smith and bookhagen 2018 as well as increased contribution of δ 18o and δd depleted glacier and snowmelt to surface water at high elevation sites these factors emerge as clear controls on δ 18o and δd lapse rates when we compare studies across the himalayan front fig 7 to a lesser extent interannual variability in the strength of the ism or wwds as related to teleconnections with the el niño southern oscillation may also influence the strength of the δ 18o and δd lapse rates by augmenting the magnitude of the rainout effect cannon et al 2015 gadgil et al 2004 broadly we know that sites in the western himalaya have stronger wwd influence than the east whereas the eastern himalaya sites have a stronger ism influence than the west bookhagen and burbank 2010 lang and barros 2004 this relative influence of wwd versus ism precipitation is reflected in regional patterns of δ 18o and δd lapse rates fig 7 with the steepest lapse rates occurring in large basins with relatively greater snowpack from the wwd and drainage areas that include headwaters in the tibetan plateau where the ism influence is weaker than the wwd indeed several other studies note that δ 18o and δd lapse rates derived from surface waters in high altitude regions are strongly influenced by complex precipitation patterns driven by varying influence of the ism versus wwd post depositional processes in snowpack and seasonal glacial melt hren et al 2009 poage and chamberlain 2001 our data document strong non linear δ 18o and δd lapse rates in the eastern himalaya a region with reduced wwd influence compared to the western himalaya where non linear lapse rates have also been suggested van der veen et al 2018 δ 18o and δd lapse rates are used as inputs to paleoclimate and modern climate reconstructions however as indicated by our results there are significant differences in the magnitude of the δ 18o and δd lapse rates across seasons which is likely driven by transitions between the ism and wwd precipitation regimes paleoclimate reconstructions often rely on pedogenic stable oxygen δ 18o values for the analysis and assume linear lapse rates along an elevation gradient florea et al 2017 argue that groundwater more accurately reflects the true precipitation δ 18o and δd lapse rate however our study indicates that even groundwater δ 18o and δd values are not fully conservative and reflect distinct seasonal transitions in moisture source this seasonal variability is reinforced in bershaw et al 2012 who note that δ 18o and δd values reflect distinct precipitation sources and local meteorological processes along elevation transects of the himalayan and the tibetan plateau our results support concerns raised by hren et al 2009 that the assumption of linear δ 18o and δd lapse rates will lead to misinterpretation of paleoclimatic or paleoenvironmental change we suggest that the sensitivity of δ 18o and δd lapse rates to seasonal precipitation patterns can be used to improve the application of δ 18o and δd lapse rates in paleoclimate and modern climate analyses 5 2 deuterium excess as a tracer for seasonal moisture source transitions deuterium excess emerges as a useful tool to investigate the variation in δ 18o and δd values driven by precipitation patterns and seasonal moisture source transitions altitude controls on deuterium excess fig 4 may reflect two distinct processes 1 increased evaporation and moisture recycling in lower elevations and 2 post depositional processes such as sublimation in the higher elevation regions smith and bookhagen 2018 average deuterium excess values for wwd sourced water are relatively high 15 whereas ism sourced water averages are lower 8 12 gat and carmi 1970 hren et al 2009 the pre monsoon samples in the barun khola that drain snowmelt dominated basins mean catchment elevations between 4000 and 5000 m align with average wwd deuterium excess values whereas the post monsoon samples more closely resemble the ism fig 4 indicating a distinct transition and mixing of moisture sources across seasons jeelani et al 2013 melting and refreezing of snow will further accentuate the elevated deuterium excess values found in drainage basins dominated by snowmelt as compared to basins dominated by glacial melt cooper 1998 taylor et al 2002 as expected the majority of deuterium excess values from samples collected in the sabha khola in both the pre and post monsoon seasons fall within the average range of ism deuterium excess values with the exception of river samples collected from the headwaters of the sabha khola which have snowpack from wwd precipitation and exhibit elevated deuterium excess values compared to the rest of the basin there is a clear correlation between loss of snowpack from pre to post monsoon season and decreased deuterium excess values fig 5 which provides further evidence of a transition in moisture sourced from continental sourced wwd precipitation with relatively high deuterium excess values in the pre monsoon season to marine sourced ism precipitation in the post monsoon season with relatively lower deuterium excess values glacier melt samples exhibit almost no variation in deuterium excess values across seasons reinforcing our hypothesis that high deuterium excess is an indicator specific to wwd sourced precipitation in the region river samples which integrate snowmelt glacial melt and groundwater sources decrease from the pre to post monsoon season indicating shift in discharge sourced from wwd sourced snowmelt to ism sourced rainfall these results complement previous studies across the himalaya that found similar patterns in deuterium excess linked to precipitation moisture sources in the himalaya in a broad survey across the himalaya and tibetan plateau hren et al 2009 notes that deuterium excess values are strongly correlated to elevation and longitude providing a distinct tracer for water vapor transported from the bay of bengal indian ocean and westerly derived continental sources van der veen et al 2018 notes a transition in deuterium excess lapse rates at 4200 m in the sutlej river in the western himalaya a shift from 1 5 km 1 below 4200 m to 3 0 km 1 above 4200 m that correlates to increased snowpack in the high elevation regions of the watershed the deuterium excess breakpoint does not exist in the alaknanda basin about 350 km to the east of the sutlej which receives less snowpack and is a lower elevation catchment considered in tandem with the spatial variability of wwd derived snowpack across the himalaya fig 7 these results predict increased seasonal variation in deuterium excess and isotope values as we move westward along the himalayan front building from the results of our synoptic sampling campaign the time series data fig 6 show increasing deuterium excess values at the onset of the monsoon indicating increased contributions from high deuterium excess continental sourced wwd snowpack to river discharge and is associated with surface temperatures greater than 0 c snow melt dominates the water budget until early june at which point the contributing source to streamflow transitions to lower deuterium excess marine sourced ism rainfall eventually stabilizing around mid july when ism rainfall dominates the water supply in both catchments both the barun and sabha khola time series data include peaks in deuterium excess at the onset of the monsoon in may and june fig 6 two processes could explain these peaks first the rivers may be flushed with snowmelt at the onset of the monsoon driven by a combination of increasing temperature and rain on snow melting events smith and bookhagen 2018 wulf et al 2012 second the peaks could indicate mixing with pre monsoon rainfall events which based on balestrini et al 2016 s study in the khumbu region may have elevated deuterium excess values this is particularly true in the sabha khola where deuterium excess values in early monsoon rainfall events could be further elevated due to high humidity increased evaporation and moisture recycling with local water vapor either of these processes alone or a combination of the two could drive the peaks in deuterium excess at the monsoon onset the decline in deuterium excess values in the barun khola in early september is most likely associated with a pulse of low deuterium excess glacial melt water following high temperatures throughout august see fig s1 6 conclusions our results indicate that δ 18o and δd lapse rates strengthen in the high elevation eastern himalaya regions the δ 18o and δd lapse rates derived from river water are controlled by the relative influence of source waters groundwater snowmelt and glacial melt as well as regional climate processes particularly seasonally variable precipitation sourced from the ism and wwd and as such are temporally variable on interannual time scales notably we find greater variability in the δ 18o and δd values of river water samples in the pre monsoon season when snowmelt contributes to high elevation rivers and groundwater is the dominant source in the low elevation rivers in the post monsoon season the δ 18o and δd values of river water are depleted relative to the pre monsoon and reflect the anticipated depletion associated with the rainout effect from a long monsoon season our data indicate that δ 18o and δd lapse rates derived from river water draining from catchments with mean elevations greater than 4 km are 5 7 times more negative than the δ 18o and δd lapse rates calculated from river water samples with basin elevations below 3 km these results may influence the interpretation of paleoclimate and paleoelevation records and reinforce the need for additional high elevation sampling campaigns from areas with high relief in the himalaya as evidenced in the time series data the unique seasonal variability of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes can be exploited to track individual hydro metrological events see also balestrini et al 2016 in the khumbu and van der veen et al 2018 in northwest india additional studies from other regions of the himalaya that capture the variability in the strength of the ism or wwd and incorporate sampling sites from rivers with varying contributions from snowmelt glacial melt groundwater and rainfall are needed to further validate the spatiotemporal patterns described here by targeting low flow periods before and after the monsoon we derive new insights on the utility of isotopic tracers to assess base flow from meltwaters and groundwater contributing to himalayan rivers in small and mid sized catchments such as the barun khola and sabha khola rivers are ungauged and in situ meteorological data are nonexistent our data highlight the timing of snowmelt events and can be used to broadly assess the potential impacts of glacial retreat seasonal and interannual variability in snowpack and regional shifts in the intensity and timing of the ism and wwd on the composition of himalayan rivers bolch et al 2012 cannon et al 2015 malik et al 2016 these results contribute to a growing body of work from the himalaya and andes see hill et al 2018 that utilize oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope tracers particularly deuterium excess to define the spatiotemporal indicators of rain snow and glacial meltwaters and groundwater to assess seasonal fluxes in high
