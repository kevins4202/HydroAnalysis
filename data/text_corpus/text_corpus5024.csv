25120,current process based models of autumn phenophases are generally based on autumn temperature and or photoperiod cues the dependence of autumn phenology on environmental conditions occurring throughout the leafy season has been overlooked in this study we incorporated the effect of leafy season temperature and precipitation in process based models with the aim to improve the modelling of autumn phenology we tested the ability of three existing and three new autumn phenology models in predicting the occurrence of leaf coloration of four deciduous tree species during 1981 2012 across temperate china the results show that the models taking the effects of both the leafy season temperature and low precipitation into account performed best over both calibration and validation data compared with existing autumn phenological models the best models predict that the potential delay of autumn phenology in a warmer world is modulated by the impact of leafy season climate on leaf senescence in a complex way increased leafy season temperature tends to hasten the occurrence of leaf coloration while low leafy season precipitation tends to delay it additionally we tested the hypothesis of a local adaptation of tree phenology through the evaluation of site specific model parameterizations local fittings of the critical temperature sums in all models did not improve the model ability to simulate the occurrence of leaf coloration which suggests either that local adaptation of leaf senescence process is virtually non existent across the populations considered or that the genetic variation of leaf coloration traits among populations cannot be detected by our models our findings highlighted the importance of leafy season climate in autumn phenology modelling and its possible offset effect in the response of autumn senescence to future warming keywords leaf coloration process based models leafy season temperature leafy season precipitation local adaptation of leaf senescence 1 introduction plant phenology regulates ecosystem processes related to the carbon delpierre et al 2009b water hogg et al 2000 and nutrient cooke and weih 2005 escudero and del arco 1987 miki and doi 2016 cycles and feeds back to the climate system peñuelas and filella 2009 richardson et al 2013 schwartz 1992 an accurate representation of plant phenology is essential for terrestrial ecosystem models of which some are used as land surface schemes for earth system models richardson et al 2012 much effort has been done for the modelling of spring phenological phases chuine 2000 chuine et al 2013 hänninen 1995 kramer 1994 xu and chen 2013 but the modelling of autumn phenophases like leaf coloration and leaf fall delpierre et al 2009a keenan and richardson 2015 has received less attention thus there are still relatively few autumn phenology models and most display a limited ability to accurately predict the timing of autumn phenophases hence their responses to climate change gallinat et al 2015 gill et al 2015 for temperate and boreal tree species several statistical and process based models have been developed to simulate the leaf coloration dates delpierre et al 2009a dufrêne et al 2005 jeong and medvigy 2014 jolly et al 2005 keenan and richardson 2015 olsson and jönsson 2015 richardson et al 2006 white et al 1997 xie et al 2018 although statistical models that rely on correlations between the timing of autumn phenological events and climatic cues chuine et al 2013 hanninen and kramer 2007 are simple and sometimes may perform better than process based models olsson and jönsson 2014 they are considered not to be applicable out of their calibration range which hinders their application for predicting autumn phenology under future climate change therefore process based models are urgently needed to date few process based models have been developed for simulating leaf coloration delpierre et al 2009a dufrêne et al 2005 keenan and richardson 2015 these models share a common framework in which the leaf coloration process was defined as three components delpierre et al 2009a 1 the start date of leaf senescence processes that is the timing when mature leaves begin entering into senescence state 2 the daily leaf senescence development rate which represents the influence of climatic factors on the progress of leaf coloration 3 a required critical value typically a cold temperature sum threshold for the occurrence of leaf coloration the start date of leaf senescence process is usually set on a fixed date such as summer solstice yu et al 2016 or is determined by a photoperiod threshold delpierre et al 2009a jeong and medvigy 2014 keenan and richardson 2015 that means leaf senescence was proposed to occur after a fixed date or when photoperiod dropped below a species specific threshold the description of leaf senescence development rate is a crucial part in leaf coloration modelling mathematically it is a function of climatic factors influencing leaf senescence in some process based models dufrêne et al 2005 yu et al 2016 temperature is considered as the only factor to affect leaf coloration progress in which the leaf coloration date is proposed to occur when the accumulated cold degree day sum cdd fulfils a given requirement yet some studies evidenced that along with temperature photoperiod is another important factor influencing leaf coloration delpierre et al 2009a estiarte and peñuelas 2015 fracheboud et al 2009 a process based model combining the effect of both temperature and photoperiod on leaf coloration has been developed by delpierre et al 2009a and applied widely over the temperate zone archetti et al 2013 tao et al 2018 vitasse et al 2011 yang et al 2012 this model assumes that after the summer solstice shortening photoperiod starts triggering the initiation of leaf senescence which is subsequently accelerated by low temperature possibly in interaction with photoperiod generally the third component the required critical cold temperature sum for forcing leaf coloration is considered to be constant for a given species being considered as a cross population average phenological trait delpierre et al 2009a dufrêne et al 2005 based on this framework the spring influenced autumn phenology model siam keenan and richardson 2015 modified the required critical cold temperature sum to assume it varying with spring budburst in line with the relations between spring and autumn phenology earlier later spring budburst could lead to earlier later leaf coloration reported by some studies fu et al 2014 keenan and richardson 2015 in boreal and temperate trees the annual cycle of organ growth and senescence is a continuous process and forms an integrated system where one phase in the cycle affects the subsequent phases delpierre et al 2016 hanninen and kramer 2007 hänninen and tanino 2011 sarvas 1972 1974 accordingly in line with the siam model one may assume that both the summer and autumn climatic conditions regulate the occurrence of autumn leaf coloration some evidence reported a negative correlation between the leaf coloration and temperature conditions prevailing several months earlier e g may june archetti et al 2013 estrella and menzel 2006 gordo and sanz 2010 which suggests that previous climate experienced by trees may impact the leaf coloration date in a previous work we further demonstrated that beyond autumn climatic conditions temperature experienced by the trees during leafy season also influences the date of leaf coloration liu et al 2018 higher leafy season temperature is associated with earlier leaf coloration date beside the promoting influence of autumn low temperature which has been confirmed from an experimental study fu et al 2018 according to such results we may expect the critical cold temperature sum at which leaf coloration occurs to be smaller following a warm growing season in addition environmental stresses such as drought hwang et al 2014 xie et al 2015 or nutrient deficiency can also hasten the timing of leaf coloration gan and amasino 1997 lim et al 2007 recent studies found that meteorological drought a precipitation shortfall would delay the occurrence of leaf coloration xie et al 2015 2018 which is opposite to what is expected under ecophysiological drought bréda et al 2006 lim et al 2007 studies show that drought events have increased worldwide dai 2011 trenberth et al 2014 and northeastern china has experienced severe and prolonged dry period li et al 2015 however there is no process based model considering drought effect on leaf coloration to date in this study we used long term ground observations of leaf phenology for four deciduous forest tree species collected from 1981 to 2012 in temperate china and aimed to evaluate and simulate the effects of leafy season climate on leaf coloration dates through a process oriented modelling approach we proposed three new models incorporating the effect of leafy season climate namely leafy season temperature low precipitation index and their interaction on leaf coloration and compared their abilities with three previously published models we further tested the hypothesis of a local adaptation of the autumn phenology of tree populations through the evaluation of species specific vs site specific model parameterizations 2 materials and methods 2 1 phenological observations we focused on four major deciduous tree species with wide distribution in china hankow willow salix matsudana koidz siberian elm ulmus pumila l black locust robinia pseudoacacia l and simon poplar populus simonii carr the phenological observations for the four tree species were obtained from the countrywide phenological monitoring network of china meterological administration chen 2013 we selected the first leaf unfolding lu and full leaf coloration lc observations in temperate china from 1981 to 2012 the lu date is identified as the day when the first unfolded leaf is visible and the lc date is defined as the day when almost all green leaves have colored china meterological administration 1993 records were excluded if lu and lc dates were not observed in the same year since phenological observations are prone to larges uncertainties schaber and badeck 2002 and considering the absence of quality flag in the study database we identified and eliminated anomalous data deviating beyond two standard deviations from the local average sites with more than 20 years of phenological time series after outlier removal were used in the study finally we obtained a total of 1107 observations spreading over 38 stations with lu and lc data from 1981 to 2012 fig 1 more precisely there are 226 observations in 9 stations for hankow willow 357 observations in 15 stations for siberian elm 191 observations in 8 stations for black locust and 333 observations in 14 stations for simon poplar table s1 2 2 meteorological data the daily mean air temperature and precipitation data used in this study are available from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn we tested several formulations for considering the role of water balance on leaf coloration i e seasonal precipitation sums p pet precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration indexes and a simple soil water balance table s3 guyot 1998 finally the most robust results were obtained with a low precipitation index lpi estimated as the number of events with 7 consecutive days without precipitation during the leafy season which had previously been positively correlated to leaf senescence liu et al 2018 xie et al 2015 we calculated the daily photoperiod for each station as a function of the latitude of the station and the day of year forsythe et al 1995 2 3 leaf coloration process based models we tested the respective abilities of three previously published and three new process oriented models to simulate the lc dates 2 3 1 current existing models the first model is the cold degree days cdd model which assumes that the process of leaf senescence progresses under the influence of low temperature dufrêne et al 2005 jeong and medvigy 2014 richardson et al 2006 here we proposed the leaf coloration state slc for each day d begins at the date when the daily photoperiod p decreases below a critical photoperiod pstart and the leaf coloration development rate for each day rlc is controlled by temperatures t below a base temperature tb the leaf coloration development rate is assumed to increase linearly with decreasing air temperature when slc achieves a threshold value ycrit the full leaf coloration lc occurs formally after a set photoperiod is reached p pstart these processes can be formulated as 1 r lc d t b t d t d t b 0 t d t b 2 s lc d s lc d 1 r lc d 3 if s lc d y crit lc d where in the eq 3 d is the predicted leaf coloration date doy the second model is the model developed by delpierre et al 2009a called dm hereafter dm assumes that leaf coloration is the outcome of a continuous senescence processes considering photoperiod p and air temperature t as driving forces of senescence in temperate trees the leaf coloration development rate for each day rlc is controlled by temperatures possibly interacting with daily photoperiod therefore the difference between cdd model and dm is the calculation of rlc in this model we calculated rlc as the following function eq 4 4 r lc d t b t d x f p d y t d t b 0 t d t b 5 f p d p d p s t a r t o r f p d 1 p d p s t a r t where x and y are two form parameters allowing for different proportional effects of temperature and photoperiod on leaf coloration the third model is a spring influenced autumn model siam which is developed based on dm keenan and richardson 2015 the assumption of this model is that leaf coloration is driven by photoperiod and low temperature but ycrit is a linear function of the spring date anomaly this model was motivated by the observation of a positive correlation between the occurrences of leaf coloration and spring budburst fu et al 2014 siam differs from dm in the calculation of ycrit eq 6 6 y c r i t a b s a where a and b are parameters and sa is the observed leaf unfolding anomaly calculated by the difference between the leaf unfolding date in the current year and the site average leaf unfolding date 2 3 2 the new models the fourth model is developed based on our previous research which evidenced that the leafy season mean temperature may offset the requirement of autumn low temperature for leaf coloration liu et al 2018 on that basis we propose here a new model based on dm for which the threshold value ycrit is related to the current leafy season mean temperature that means ycrit is a linear function of leafy season mean temperature tls 7 y c r i t c d t l s where c and d are parameters and tls is computed as the mean temperature from lu date to the first day when the photoperiod is decreased below pstart after summer solstice we refer to this model as tdm because we add the tls influences to dm the fifth model is similar to tdm but hypothesizes that ycrit is a linear function of a precipitation index calculated over the leafy season lpils 8 y c r i t e f l p i l s where e f are all free parameters and lpils is computed as the mean lpi from lu date to the first day when the photoperiod is decreased below pstart after summer solstice this model is called pdm below the last model is a combination of the fourth and fifth models this model postulated that both the leafy season averaged temperature and the low precipitation index together have an effect on leaf coloration dates resulting in ycrit being a linear function of both tls and lpils 9 y c r i t a 0 a 1 t l s a 2 l p i l s where a0 a1 a2 are free parameters we termed the sixth model tpdm in the following because it includes the effects of both temperature and precipitation as represented in the tdm and pdm 2 4 model calibration and validation we postulate that individual species may display different sensitivities of leaf coloration to climatic variations accordingly we fitted each model at the species scale moreover we formulated two hypotheses as regards the parameterization of the species specific models a the sensitivity of leaf coloration to climatic variations is common to all populations for a given species such that the parameters are considered identical for all populations of a given species b the sensitivity of leaf coloration to climatic variations varies among populations of a given species e g due to local peculiarities such as among populations differences in terms of genetics and or pedological e g soil water reserve conditions in this case we assume that the required critical cold temperature sum resulting in full leaf coloration ycrit varies among sites we tested the two hypotheses in all six models using phenological observation sites with more than 20 years of ground data the original dataset was divided in two subsets of similar distribution using the wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 5 for each species one subset including 80 of the data was used for model calibration calib subset and the remaining 20 were used to validate models valid subset since the subsampling of the original data may influence the parameter estimation process and model fitting ability we calibrated and validated each model 30 times using different randomly defined calibration and validation data subsample the model parameterization was conducted using the simulated annealing method chuine et al 1998 the simulated annealing algorithm requires parameter bounds which were specified as follows pstart from minimum photoperiod of all sites to the maximum photoperiod of all sites for each species tb from 10 c to maximum temperature of all sites for each species x and y from 0 to 2 based on these parameters the daily leaf coloration development rate was determined and the leaf coloration development state slc was accumulated from the start date of leaf senescence processes until the observed leaf coloration date hänninen 2016 then we calculated the cold temperature sum for each sample and the mean of the cold temperature sum for each species was taken for an estimate of threshold temperature sum value ycrit for cdd model and dm hänninen 2016 for the rest four models ycrit is estimated using the linear regression models eqs 6 9 built between the cold temperature sum and the climatic factors in each model moreover the parameter set yielding the smallest root mean square error between simulated and observed lc dates was selected as the best parameter set of each model finally we assessed the robustness of six models to accurately predict the lc dates in the validation subset 2 5 model performance we assessed the quality of the model predictions with three performance indices the modelling efficiency me m e 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 the root mean square error rmse r m s e i 1 n o i p i 2 n and the corrected aikaike information criterion aicc a i c c n l n i 1 n o i p i 2 n 2 k 2 k k 1 n k 1 where o i is the observation at data point i o is the average observation p i is the prediction at data point i n is the number of observations k is the number of model parameters we considered the average rmse me and aicc calculated from the 30 calibration validation data splitting as performance metrics for each model the differences of aicc δaicc between each model and the model with the minimum aicc were calculated the model with the minimum aicc was selected as the best model for each species 3 results 3 1 species specific modelling comparisons in all study species me values above zero in both calibration and validation datasets show that all models outperformed the null model the latter being defined as the mean observed lc date for each species among the six lc models considered the model integrating an effect of tls and lpils on the required critical cold temperature sum i e tpdm table 1 showed the best performances with minimum aicc over calibration data for all species except black locust when tested on the validation i e unknown data tpdm further displayed the most accurate predictions of lc dates with the lowest rmse from 7 30 days to 9 93 days and the highest me from 0 32 days to 0 62 for all species models show consistent performances in calibration and validation for three species hankow willow siberian elm and simon poplar meaning that models giving the best performances in calibration dataset of lc also yielded the most accurate predictions in validation dataset of lc table 1 for black locust we identify tdm as the best model showing the minimum aicc over calibration data the tdm predicts lc dates rmse 7 15 accurately in validation subset though slightly less than tpdm rmse 7 12 therefore we retained tpdm as the best model for hankow willow siberian elm and simon poplar while we retained tdm as the best model for black locust 3 2 performances of the best models 3 2 1 comparison of observed and predicted leaf coloration dates comparison of the predicted and observed lc dates for the four species fig 2 shows that the majority of data points fall along the diagonal line indicating agreement between modelled and observed lc dates the correlation coefficients between predicted and observed autumn leaf coloration dates are significantly positive p 0 05 for all the four species fig 2 this evaluation confirms the capability of the best model to simulate plausible lc dates for each species however the best models still could not simulate the earlier and later lc observations especially for black locust and simon poplar fig 2c d the bias is larger for earlier and later lc observations fig s1 the predicted ranges of lc dates poorly matched the observed ones for four species observed ranges 68 days 75 days 45 days 41 days predicted ranges 44 days 51 days 22 days 19 days for hankow willow siberian elm black locust and simon poplar respectively 3 2 2 inter annual and inter site variability the species specific best models ability to represent the inter annual variability of lc dates is assessed by comparing the annual mean observed and simulated lc dates over the study sites fig 3 the simulated mean lc dates over the study sites correlates significantly p 0 01 with observations for all species pearson s r 0 56 0 55 0 64 for hankow willow siberian elm and simon poplar respectively fig 3a b d except black locust p 0 1 fig 3c consequently the best model could generally capture the inter annual dynamics of lc dates for all species except black locust the site to site variability of observed lc dates was particularly well simulated by the species specific best models r 0 81 0 92 0 83 0 78 all p 0 01 in hankow willow siberian elm black locust simon poplar respectively fig 4 in particular later observed lc dates occurring at lower latitude were well reproduced in simulations which shows that the species specific best model parameterized with the same parameter set over all sites largely captures the spatial variability of lc dates the largest fluctuations of lc dates e g from site 2 to site 5 for hankow willow and from site 14 to site 15 for siberian elm are well replicated in the simulations 3 2 3 parameters of the best models the best species specific model parameter distributions are shown in fig 5 all parameters were well determined in the best models and the parameters were species specific fig 5 the median photoperiod for trees to begin leaf coloration progress pstart are 14 1 h 13 6 h 12 4 h and 11 7 h fig 5a and the base temperature tb thresholds are 16 8 c 13 9 c 23 4 c 18 1 c on average fig 5b for hankow willow siberian elm black locust and simon poplar respectively the x and y are mostly in the range of 0 1 for all species except the x of hankow willow 0 5 2 the median of x value is larger than that of y value for hankow willow and black locust while the opposite conditions are observed for siberian elm and simon poplar fig 5c d the slopes between the required critical cold temperature sum and tls are negative for hankow willow and siberian elm while those are negative for black locust and simon poplar lpils has interacting effects on leaf coloration for all species except black locust the slope between the required critical cold temperature sum and lpils is negative for hankow willow but it shows a positive slope between the required critical cold temperature sum and lpils for siberian elm and simon poplar 3 3 site specific critical cold temperature sum fitting fitting the critical temperature sums on each site table 2 decreased the calibration rmses as compared to calibration at the species scale compare with table 1 the lowest mean site specific calibration rmses ranged from 5 65 to 7 94 days with minor differences among species table 2 yet the calibration mes of about 58 models 14 24 models are negative which implies these models perform worse than the null models over validation dataset all mes are below zero for all species revealing that all site specific models applying to the independent dataset perform worse than the null model 4 discussion 4 1 model comparison and climatic factors in leaf coloration models various hypotheses about the climatic controls on leaf senescence have been proposed estrella and menzel 2006 but they have not been translated to mechanistic models with good predictive power currently most autumn phenological models hypothesize leaf senescence to be the controlled by late summer and or autumn temperature and day length variation delpierre et al 2009a fu et al 2018 white et al 1997 in our previous study liu et al 2018 we completed this view reporting that beyond the influence of autumn climatic conditions leaf coloration was also influenced by climate experienced by trees throughout the leafy season paradoxically while a warm autumn delayed the occurrence of leaf coloration warm temperatures experienced earlier during the leafy season tended to hasten the occurrence of leaf coloration here we introduce the influence of leafy season climate on leaf senescence into the leaf coloration models our leaf coloration modelling results table 1 suggested that the models adding the influence of leafy season temperature and a low precipitation index on leaf coloration performed better than three existing models that did not include the influence of leafy season climate this proved the role of leafy season climate in leaf coloration that the leafy season climate is likely related with critical cold temperature sum the higher leafy season temperature and more days without precipitation may lead to the smaller critical cold temperature sum the possible underlying mechanism might be that high temperature and large precipitation accelerates the rates of metabolism and senescence kikuzawa et al 2013 leopold and kriedemann 1975 pearl 1928 rosenthal and camm 1996 leading to the advancing of leaf coloration these antagonistic effects of temperature may explain why a delayed trend of autumn leaf coloration along with warming autumn is insignificant or weak menzel et al 2006 pudas et al 2008 as the climate warms warmer leafy season advances the occurrence of leaf coloration while the higher autumn temperature tends to delay the leaf coloration therefore the delay days would be offset by the advance induced by warm leafy season 4 2 the ability of the best model and model estimated leaf coloration responses to climate in our study the best model has predicting errors rmse of about 7 10 days in temperate china which is slightly smaller than those of previous studies e g delpierre et al 2009a b tao et al 2018 rmse 9 12 days in general the best model could capture the temporal fig 3 and spatial fig 4 variability of lc dates interestingly we found model parameterized at the species scale could represent the inter site variability r 0 78 0 92 better than inter annual variability r 0 55 0 64 however the best models still failed to simulate the earlier and later observed lc dates with overestimated earlier but underestimated later observed lc dates which is usual though not systematic in leaf coloration modelling basler 2016 delpierre et al 2009a olsson and jönsson 2015 the strong relationship between bias and leaf coloration dates fig s1 questions the reliability of the model structure this implies that some important unknown factor influencing the leaf coloration may be missed in current model frame or the current model could not describe the actual leaf coloration process very well for example the early frost events can also result in sudden leaf senescence norby et al 2003 and extreme warm temperature can delay the leaf senescence crabbe et al 2016 but the influence of these extreme events on leaf coloration have not been considered in current models the leaf coloration responses to extreme events should be included in the future leaf coloration models also the current model structure describe the responses of leaf coloration to air temperature but did not separate the different influence of daytime temperature and night time temperature during one day which have been found that the daytime temperature and night time temperature have contrasting effects on the timing of leaf senescence in northern hemisphere wu et al 2018 another possibility lies in the uncertainties caused by lc ground observations because leaf senescence is obviously more problematic to observe than the spring phenology and the leaf senescence process is protracted it is difficult for observers to assign single date to the leaf coloration event moreover the variation of leaf coloration among individual trees could also increase the uncertainty in leaf coloration at the population scale the uncertainty of the leaf coloration observations due to the observation methods and variability within population adds the inaccuracy to predict the leaf coloration dates the comparison of fitted parameter provided insights as regards the variety of phenological traits among tree species hankow willow pstart 14 1 h is the earliest of the studied tree species while simon poplar pstart 11 7 h is the latest species entering the leaf senescence process fig 5a though the photoperiod requirement difference between species reaches to more than 2 h the results are consistent with the previous finding in which the required photoperiod ranges from 11 h to 14 5 h archetti et al 2013 delpierre et al 2009a keenan and richardson 2015 tao et al 2018 vitasse et al 2011 yang et al 2012 siberian elm begins to accumulate the coldness when the air temperature is below a relatively low temperature 13 9 c while black locust begins that under 23 4 c these temperature thresholds are lower than usually inferred in autumn phenological modelling studies archetti et al 2013 delpierre et al 2009a keenan and richardson 2015 tao et al 2018 vitasse et al 2011 yang et al 2012 from the seminal work of sarvas 1972 a lot of experimental work has been conducted to determine effective temperature thresholds of budburst heide 1993 such experimental evidence is still missing as regards autumn phenological phases though warming experiments have clearly demonstrated a delaying effect of warm temperatures on the occurrence of senescence fu et al 2018 norby et al 2000 verdier et al 2014 for hankow willow and siberian elm the identification of negative slope between tls and the required critical cold temperature sum as a result of the calibration procedure confirmed our previous finding that higher temperature during the leaf season tls induces earlier leaf coloration and reduces coldness requirements liu et al 2018 interestingly fu et al 2018 also found that exposing european beech saplings to summer warming reduces cold degree hours accumulation to leaf senescence which also supports the negative relationship between tls and leaf coloration however black locust and simon poplar showed the opposite case in which the relations between tls and the required critical cold temperature sum are positive fig 5e this does not go the same direction with our previous study results liu et al 2018 because in this study we are in a prognostic model we can not use the lc dates as a limit for defining the leafy season during which summer temperature will influence the leaf coloration process contrary to the statistical approach used in the paper of liu et al 2018 however it shows that there is possibly another tls effect on leaf coloration which is similar with the results usually reported that warmer temperature delay leaf senescence gunderson et al 2012 liu et al 2016 marchin et al 2015 the effects of lpi on leaf coloration were found in 3 out of 4 species which shows more lpils will reduce the required critical cold temperature sum for hankow willow but increase the required critical value for siberian elm and simon poplar in best model fig 5f these mixed results obtained across species are in line with the general diversity of responses of autumn senescence to water availability reported in the literature while a combination of heat wave and soil drought may induce sudden leaf mortality in winter deciduous trees bréda et al 2006 the effects of milder water shortage are more ambiguous while estrella and menzel 2006 report an increase of the number of dry autumn days to be associated with an earlier occurrence of leaf coloration in some species one species out of the four species studied in germany xie et al 2015 recently report an opposite relation for some northeastern american species in line with this diversity of results we obtained different results as regards the link between water cues and leaf coloration in order to understand the influence of water conditions on leaf coloration beyond correlation with simple water input indexes such as the amount of precipitation estrella and menzel 2006 archetti et al 2013 or the number of dry days estrella and menzel 2006 xie et al 2015 we further tested process based model formulations including water balances index as a modulator the required cold temperature sum such as p pet indexes and a simple soil water balance not shown their modelling performance was always worse than obtained with the simple lpi index we note that establishing a meaningful water balance requires accessing information regarding both the soil type root depth and soil texture and the tree population structure e g leaf area index granier et al 1999 that we could not access in this work 4 3 evaluating local adaptation in leaf coloration traits with a model the current vast majority of autumn phenological process based models are parameterized and tested using integrated phenological data collected over independent tree populations by assigning the same model parameter values to all populations they hypothesize that local phenological adaptation that would result in a variation of model parameters among populations e g von wuehlisch et al 1995 is of low influence as compared with climate related adaptation of trees over large areas however if the phenology of one species is locally adapted to climate this method could result in flawed model calibration and validation chuine et al 1999 in our study we tested two types based on hyp a b of model parameterization to evaluate the possible local adaptation in leaf coloration the species specific models hyp a hypothesized that each species owns the common phenological traits same model parameters for one species when tested against ground observations at different sites the site specific models hyp b hypothesized that the parameters pstart tb x and y are the same for one species at different sites but the required critical cold temperature sum varying with sites von wuehlisch et al 1995 we evidenced those species specific models hyp a perform well me 0 while the site specific models hyp b were not efficient for all six models show me 0 the results suggest that i either the models are not precise enough to detect local adaptation ii or it may also be that autumn coloration is not a trait subject to local adaptation in the study species vitasse et al 2011 estimated the contribution of each genetic and climatic component explaining the variability of leaf unfolding date observed across common gardens see fig 3 in their paper and found that phenotypic variations of leaf phenology observed in situ for tree seedlings are mainly the consequence of plasticity due to climatic variation rather than genetic effects our results show that similar to leaf unfolding leaf senescence may also likely respond to climate stronger than to genetic difference conflicts of interests the authors declare no conflicts of interests acknowledgements the authors thank the meteorological

throughout the leafy season has been overlooked in this study we incorporated the effect of leafy season temperature and precipitation in process based models with the aim to improve the modelling of autumn phenology we tested the ability of three existing and three new autumn phenology models in predicting the occurrence of leaf coloration of four deciduous tree species during 1981 2012 across temperate china the results show that the models taking the effects of both the leafy season temperature and low precipitation into account performed best over both calibration and validation data compared with existing autumn phenological models the best models predict that the potential delay of autumn phenology in a warmer world is modulated by the impact of leafy season climate on leaf senescence in a complex way increased leafy season temperature tends to hasten the occurrence of leaf coloration while low leafy season precipitation tends to delay it additionally we tested the hypothesis of a local adaptation of tree phenology through the evaluation of site specific model parameterizations local fittings of the critical temperature sums in all models did not improve the model ability to simulate the occurrence of leaf coloration which suggests either that local adaptation of leaf senescence process is virtually non existent across the populations considered or that the genetic variation of leaf coloration traits among populations cannot be detected by our models our findings highlighted the importance of leafy season climate in autumn phenology modelling and its possible offset effect in the response of autumn senescence to future warming keywords leaf coloration process based models leafy season temperature leafy season precipitation local adaptation of leaf senescence 1 introduction plant phenology regulates ecosystem processes related to the carbon delpierre et al 2009b water hogg et al 2000 and nutrient cooke and weih 2005 escudero and del arco 1987 miki and doi 2016 cycles and feeds back to the climate system peñuelas and filella 2009 richardson et al 2013 schwartz 1992 an accurate representation of plant phenology is essential for terrestrial ecosystem models of which some are used as land surface schemes for earth system models richardson et al 2012 much effort has been done for the modelling of spring phenological phases chuine 2000 chuine et al 2013 hänninen 1995 kramer 1994 xu and chen 2013 but the modelling of autumn phenophases like leaf coloration and leaf fall delpierre et al 2009a keenan and richardson 2015 has received less attention thus there are still relatively few autumn phenology models and most display a limited ability to accurately predict the timing of autumn phenophases hence their responses to climate change gallinat et al 2015 gill et al 2015 for temperate and boreal tree species several statistical and process based models have been developed to simulate the leaf coloration dates delpierre et al 2009a dufrêne et al 2005 jeong and medvigy 2014 jolly et al 2005 keenan and richardson 2015 olsson and jönsson 2015 richardson et al 2006 white et al 1997 xie et al 2018 although statistical models that rely on correlations between the timing of autumn phenological events and climatic cues chuine et al 2013 hanninen and kramer 2007 are simple and sometimes may perform better than process based models olsson and jönsson 2014 they are considered not to be applicable out of their calibration range which hinders their application for predicting autumn phenology under future climate change therefore process based models are urgently needed to date few process based models have been developed for simulating leaf coloration delpierre et al 2009a dufrêne et al 2005 keenan and richardson 2015 these models share a common framework in which the leaf coloration process was defined as three components delpierre et al 2009a 1 the start date of leaf senescence processes that is the timing when mature leaves begin entering into senescence state 2 the daily leaf senescence development rate which represents the influence of climatic factors on the progress of leaf coloration 3 a required critical value typically a cold temperature sum threshold for the occurrence of leaf coloration the start date of leaf senescence process is usually set on a fixed date such as summer solstice yu et al 2016 or is determined by a photoperiod threshold delpierre et al 2009a jeong and medvigy 2014 keenan and richardson 2015 that means leaf senescence was proposed to occur after a fixed date or when photoperiod dropped below a species specific threshold the description of leaf senescence development rate is a crucial part in leaf coloration modelling mathematically it is a function of climatic factors influencing leaf senescence in some process based models dufrêne et al 2005 yu et al 2016 temperature is considered as the only factor to affect leaf coloration progress in which the leaf coloration date is proposed to occur when the accumulated cold degree day sum cdd fulfils a given requirement yet some studies evidenced that along with temperature photoperiod is another important factor influencing leaf coloration delpierre et al 2009a estiarte and peñuelas 2015 fracheboud et al 2009 a process based model combining the effect of both temperature and photoperiod on leaf coloration has been developed by delpierre et al 2009a and applied widely over the temperate zone archetti et al 2013 tao et al 2018 vitasse et al 2011 yang et al 2012 this model assumes that after the summer solstice shortening photoperiod starts triggering the initiation of leaf senescence which is subsequently accelerated by low temperature possibly in interaction with photoperiod generally the third component the required critical cold temperature sum for forcing leaf coloration is considered to be constant for a given species being considered as a cross population average phenological trait delpierre et al 2009a dufrêne et al 2005 based on this framework the spring influenced autumn phenology model siam keenan and richardson 2015 modified the required critical cold temperature sum to assume it varying with spring budburst in line with the relations between spring and autumn phenology earlier later spring budburst could lead to earlier later leaf coloration reported by some studies fu et al 2014 keenan and richardson 2015 in boreal and temperate trees the annual cycle of organ growth and senescence is a continuous process and forms an integrated system where one phase in the cycle affects the subsequent phases delpierre et al 2016 hanninen and kramer 2007 hänninen and tanino 2011 sarvas 1972 1974 accordingly in line with the siam model one may assume that both the summer and autumn climatic conditions regulate the occurrence of autumn leaf coloration some evidence reported a negative correlation between the leaf coloration and temperature conditions prevailing several months earlier e g may june archetti et al 2013 estrella and menzel 2006 gordo and sanz 2010 which suggests that previous climate experienced by trees may impact the leaf coloration date in a previous work we further demonstrated that beyond autumn climatic conditions temperature experienced by the trees during leafy season also influences the date of leaf coloration liu et al 2018 higher leafy season temperature is associated with earlier leaf coloration date beside the promoting influence of autumn low temperature which has been confirmed from an experimental study fu et al 2018 according to such results we may expect the critical cold temperature sum at which leaf coloration occurs to be smaller following a warm growing season in addition environmental stresses such as drought hwang et al 2014 xie et al 2015 or nutrient deficiency can also hasten the timing of leaf coloration gan and amasino 1997 lim et al 2007 recent studies found that meteorological drought a precipitation shortfall would delay the occurrence of leaf coloration xie et al 2015 2018 which is opposite to what is expected under ecophysiological drought bréda et al 2006 lim et al 2007 studies show that drought events have increased worldwide dai 2011 trenberth et al 2014 and northeastern china has experienced severe and prolonged dry period li et al 2015 however there is no process based model considering drought effect on leaf coloration to date in this study we used long term ground observations of leaf phenology for four deciduous forest tree species collected from 1981 to 2012 in temperate china and aimed to evaluate and simulate the effects of leafy season climate on leaf coloration dates through a process oriented modelling approach we proposed three new models incorporating the effect of leafy season climate namely leafy season temperature low precipitation index and their interaction on leaf coloration and compared their abilities with three previously published models we further tested the hypothesis of a local adaptation of the autumn phenology of tree populations through the evaluation of species specific vs site specific model parameterizations 2 materials and methods 2 1 phenological observations we focused on four major deciduous tree species with wide distribution in china hankow willow salix matsudana koidz siberian elm ulmus pumila l black locust robinia pseudoacacia l and simon poplar populus simonii carr the phenological observations for the four tree species were obtained from the countrywide phenological monitoring network of china meterological administration chen 2013 we selected the first leaf unfolding lu and full leaf coloration lc observations in temperate china from 1981 to 2012 the lu date is identified as the day when the first unfolded leaf is visible and the lc date is defined as the day when almost all green leaves have colored china meterological administration 1993 records were excluded if lu and lc dates were not observed in the same year since phenological observations are prone to larges uncertainties schaber and badeck 2002 and considering the absence of quality flag in the study database we identified and eliminated anomalous data deviating beyond two standard deviations from the local average sites with more than 20 years of phenological time series after outlier removal were used in the study finally we obtained a total of 1107 observations spreading over 38 stations with lu and lc data from 1981 to 2012 fig 1 more precisely there are 226 observations in 9 stations for hankow willow 357 observations in 15 stations for siberian elm 191 observations in 8 stations for black locust and 333 observations in 14 stations for simon poplar table s1 2 2 meteorological data the daily mean air temperature and precipitation data used in this study are available from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn we tested several formulations for considering the role of water balance on leaf coloration i e seasonal precipitation sums p pet precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration indexes and a simple soil water balance table s3 guyot 1998 finally the most robust results were obtained with a low precipitation index lpi estimated as the number of events with 7 consecutive days without precipitation during the leafy season which had previously been positively correlated to leaf senescence liu et al 2018 xie et al 2015 we calculated the daily photoperiod for each station as a function of the latitude of the station and the day of year forsythe et al 1995 2 3 leaf coloration process based models we tested the respective abilities of three previously published and three new process oriented models to simulate the lc dates 2 3 1 current existing models the first model is the cold degree days cdd model which assumes that the process of leaf senescence progresses under the influence of low temperature dufrêne et al 2005 jeong and medvigy 2014 richardson et al 2006 here we proposed the leaf coloration state slc for each day d begins at the date when the daily photoperiod p decreases below a critical photoperiod pstart and the leaf coloration development rate for each day rlc is controlled by temperatures t below a base temperature tb the leaf coloration development rate is assumed to increase linearly with decreasing air temperature when slc achieves a threshold value ycrit the full leaf coloration lc occurs formally after a set photoperiod is reached p pstart these processes can be formulated as 1 r lc d t b t d t d t b 0 t d t b 2 s lc d s lc d 1 r lc d 3 if s lc d y crit lc d where in the eq 3 d is the predicted leaf coloration date doy the second model is the model developed by delpierre et al 2009a called dm hereafter dm assumes that leaf coloration is the outcome of a continuous senescence processes considering photoperiod p and air temperature t as driving forces of senescence in temperate trees the leaf coloration development rate for each day rlc is controlled by temperatures possibly interacting with daily photoperiod therefore the difference between cdd model and dm is the calculation of rlc in this model we calculated rlc as the following function eq 4 4 r lc d t b t d x f p d y t d t b 0 t d t b 5 f p d p d p s t a r t o r f p d 1 p d p s t a r t where x and y are two form parameters allowing for different proportional effects of temperature and photoperiod on leaf coloration the third model is a spring influenced autumn model siam which is developed based on dm keenan and richardson 2015 the assumption of this model is that leaf coloration is driven by photoperiod and low temperature but ycrit is a linear function of the spring date anomaly this model was motivated by the observation of a positive correlation between the occurrences of leaf coloration and spring budburst fu et al 2014 siam differs from dm in the calculation of ycrit eq 6 6 y c r i t a b s a where a and b are parameters and sa is the observed leaf unfolding anomaly calculated by the difference between the leaf unfolding date in the current year and the site average leaf unfolding date 2 3 2 the new models the fourth model is developed based on our previous research which evidenced that the leafy season mean temperature may offset the requirement of autumn low temperature for leaf coloration liu et al 2018 on that basis we propose here a new model based on dm for which the threshold value ycrit is related to the current leafy season mean temperature that means ycrit is a linear function of leafy season mean temperature tls 7 y c r i t c d t l s where c and d are parameters and tls is computed as the mean temperature from lu date to the first day when the photoperiod is decreased below pstart after summer solstice we refer to this model as tdm because we add the tls influences to dm the fifth model is similar to tdm but hypothesizes that ycrit is a linear function of a precipitation index calculated over the leafy season lpils 8 y c r i t e f l p i l s where e f are all free parameters and lpils is computed as the mean lpi from lu date to the first day when the photoperiod is decreased below pstart after summer solstice this model is called pdm below the last model is a combination of the fourth and fifth models this model postulated that both the leafy season averaged temperature and the low precipitation index together have an effect on leaf coloration dates resulting in ycrit being a linear function of both tls and lpils 9 y c r i t a 0 a 1 t l s a 2 l p i l s where a0 a1 a2 are free parameters we termed the sixth model tpdm in the following because it includes the effects of both temperature and precipitation as represented in the tdm and pdm 2 4 model calibration and validation we postulate that individual species may display different sensitivities of leaf coloration to climatic variations accordingly we fitted each model at the species scale moreover we formulated two hypotheses as regards the parameterization of the species specific models a the sensitivity of leaf coloration to climatic variations is common to all populations for a given species such that the parameters are considered identical for all populations of a given species b the sensitivity of leaf coloration to climatic variations varies among populations of a given species e g due to local peculiarities such as among populations differences in terms of genetics and or pedological e g soil water reserve conditions in this case we assume that the required critical cold temperature sum resulting in full leaf coloration ycrit varies among sites we tested the two hypotheses in all six models using phenological observation sites with more than 20 years of ground data the original dataset was divided in two subsets of similar distribution using the wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 5 for each species one subset including 80 of the data was used for model calibration calib subset and the remaining 20 were used to validate models valid subset since the subsampling of the original data may influence the parameter estimation process and model fitting ability we calibrated and validated each model 30 times using different randomly defined calibration and validation data subsample the model parameterization was conducted using the simulated annealing method chuine et al 1998 the simulated annealing algorithm requires parameter bounds which were specified as follows pstart from minimum photoperiod of all sites to the maximum photoperiod of all sites for each species tb from 10 c to maximum temperature of all sites for each species x and y from 0 to 2 based on these parameters the daily leaf coloration development rate was determined and the leaf coloration development state slc was accumulated from the start date of leaf senescence processes until the observed leaf coloration date hänninen 2016 then we calculated the cold temperature sum for each sample and the mean of the cold temperature sum for each species was taken for an estimate of threshold temperature sum value ycrit for cdd model and dm hänninen 2016 for the rest four models ycrit is estimated using the linear regression models eqs 6 9 built between the cold temperature sum and the climatic factors in each model moreover the parameter set yielding the smallest root mean square error between simulated and observed lc dates was selected as the best parameter set of each model finally we assessed the robustness of six models to accurately predict the lc dates in the validation subset 2 5 model performance we assessed the quality of the model predictions with three performance indices the modelling efficiency me m e 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 the root mean square error rmse r m s e i 1 n o i p i 2 n and the corrected aikaike information criterion aicc a i c c n l n i 1 n o i p i 2 n 2 k 2 k k 1 n k 1 where o i is the observation at data point i o is the average observation p i is the prediction at data point i n is the number of observations k is the number of model parameters we considered the average rmse me and aicc calculated from the 30 calibration validation data splitting as performance metrics for each model the differences of aicc δaicc between each model and the model with the minimum aicc were calculated the model with the minimum aicc was selected as the best model for each species 3 results 3 1 species specific modelling comparisons in all study species me values above zero in both calibration and validation datasets show that all models outperformed the null model the latter being defined as the mean observed lc date for each species among the six lc models considered the model integrating an effect of tls and lpils on the required critical cold temperature sum i e tpdm table 1 showed the best performances with minimum aicc over calibration data for all species except black locust when tested on the validation i e unknown data tpdm further displayed the most accurate predictions of lc dates with the lowest rmse from 7 30 days to 9 93 days and the highest me from 0 32 days to 0 62 for all species models show consistent performances in calibration and validation for three species hankow willow siberian elm and simon poplar meaning that models giving the best performances in calibration dataset of lc also yielded the most accurate predictions in validation dataset of lc table 1 for black locust we identify tdm as the best model showing the minimum aicc over calibration data the tdm predicts lc dates rmse 7 15 accurately in validation subset though slightly less than tpdm rmse 7 12 therefore we retained tpdm as the best model for hankow willow siberian elm and simon poplar while we retained tdm as the best model for black locust 3 2 performances of the best models 3 2 1 comparison of observed and predicted leaf coloration dates comparison of the predicted and observed lc dates for the four species fig 2 shows that the majority of data points fall along the diagonal line indicating agreement between modelled and observed lc dates the correlation coefficients between predicted and observed autumn leaf coloration dates are significantly positive p 0 05 for all the four species fig 2 this evaluation confirms the capability of the best model to simulate plausible lc dates for each species however the best models still could not simulate the earlier and later lc observations especially for black locust and simon poplar fig 2c d the bias is larger for earlier and later lc observations fig s1 the predicted ranges of lc dates poorly matched the observed ones for four species observed ranges 68 days 75 days 45 days 41 days predicted ranges 44 days 51 days 22 days 19 days for hankow willow siberian elm black locust and simon poplar respectively 3 2 2 inter annual and inter site variability the species specific best models ability to represent the inter annual variability of lc dates is assessed by comparing the annual mean observed and simulated lc dates over the study sites fig 3 the simulated mean lc dates over the study sites correlates significantly p 0 01 with observations for all species pearson s r 0 56 0 55 0 64 for hankow willow siberian elm and simon poplar respectively fig 3a b d except black locust p 0 1 fig 3c consequently the best model could generally capture the inter annual dynamics of lc dates for all species except black locust the site to site variability of observed lc dates was particularly well simulated by the species specific best models r 0 81 0 92 0 83 0 78 all p 0 01 in hankow willow siberian elm black locust simon poplar respectively fig 4 in particular later observed lc dates occurring at lower latitude were well reproduced in simulations which shows that the species specific best model parameterized with the same parameter set over all sites largely captures the spatial variability of lc dates the largest fluctuations of lc dates e g from site 2 to site 5 for hankow willow and from site 14 to site 15 for siberian elm are well replicated in the simulations 3 2 3 parameters of the best models the best species specific model parameter distributions are shown in fig 5 all parameters were well determined in the best models and the parameters were species specific fig 5 the median photoperiod for trees to begin leaf coloration progress pstart are 14 1 h 13 6 h 12 4 h and 11 7 h fig 5a and the base temperature tb thresholds are 16 8 c 13 9 c 23 4 c 18 1 c on average fig 5b for hankow willow siberian elm black locust and simon poplar respectively the x and y are mostly in the range of 0 1 for all species except the x of hankow willow 0 5 2 the median of x value is larger than that of y value for hankow willow and black locust while the opposite conditions are observed for siberian elm and simon poplar fig 5c d the slopes between the required critical cold temperature sum and tls are negative for hankow willow and siberian elm while those are negative for black locust and simon poplar lpils has interacting effects on leaf coloration for all species except black locust the slope between the required critical cold temperature sum and lpils is negative for hankow willow but it shows a positive slope between the required critical cold temperature sum and lpils for siberian elm and simon poplar 3 3 site specific critical cold temperature sum fitting fitting the critical temperature sums on each site table 2 decreased the calibration rmses as compared to calibration at the species scale compare with table 1 the lowest mean site specific calibration rmses ranged from 5 65 to 7 94 days with minor differences among species table 2 yet the calibration mes of about 58 models 14 24 models are negative which implies these models perform worse than the null models over validation dataset all mes are below zero for all species revealing that all site specific models applying to the independent dataset perform worse than the null model 4 discussion 4 1 model comparison and climatic factors in leaf coloration models various hypotheses about the climatic controls on leaf senescence have been proposed estrella and menzel 2006 but they have not been translated to mechanistic models with good predictive power currently most autumn phenological models hypothesize leaf senescence to be the controlled by late summer and or autumn temperature and day length variation delpierre et al 2009a fu et al 2018 white et al 1997 in our previous study liu et al 2018 we completed this view reporting that beyond the influence of autumn climatic conditions leaf coloration was also influenced by climate experienced by trees throughout the leafy season paradoxically while a warm autumn delayed the occurrence of leaf coloration warm temperatures experienced earlier during the leafy season tended to hasten the occurrence of leaf coloration here we introduce the influence of leafy season climate on leaf senescence into the leaf coloration models our leaf coloration modelling results table 1 suggested that the models adding the influence of leafy season temperature and a low precipitation index on leaf coloration performed better than three existing models that did not include the influence of leafy season climate this proved the role of leafy season climate in leaf coloration that the leafy season climate is likely related with critical cold temperature sum the higher leafy season temperature and more days without precipitation may lead to the smaller critical cold temperature sum the possible underlying mechanism might be that high temperature and large precipitation accelerates the rates of metabolism and senescence kikuzawa et al 2013 leopold and kriedemann 1975 pearl 1928 rosenthal and camm 1996 leading to the advancing of leaf coloration these antagonistic effects of temperature may explain why a delayed trend of autumn leaf coloration along with warming autumn is insignificant or weak menzel et al 2006 pudas et al 2008 as the climate warms warmer leafy season advances the occurrence of leaf coloration while the higher autumn temperature tends to delay the leaf coloration therefore the delay days would be offset by the advance induced by warm leafy season 4 2 the ability of the best model and model estimated leaf coloration responses to climate in our study the best model has predicting errors rmse of about 7 10 days in temperate china which is slightly smaller than those of previous studies e g delpierre et al 2009a b tao et al 2018 rmse 9 12 days in general the best model could capture the temporal fig 3 and spatial fig 4 variability of lc dates interestingly we found model parameterized at the species scale could represent the inter site variability r 0 78 0 92 better than inter annual variability r 0 55 0 64 however the best models still failed to simulate the earlier and later observed lc dates with overestimated earlier but underestimated later observed lc dates which is usual though not systematic in leaf coloration modelling basler 2016 delpierre et al 2009a olsson and jönsson 2015 the strong relationship between bias and leaf coloration dates fig s1 questions the reliability of the model structure this implies that some important unknown factor influencing the leaf coloration may be missed in current model frame or the current model could not describe the actual leaf coloration process very well for example the early frost events can also result in sudden leaf senescence norby et al 2003 and extreme warm temperature can delay the leaf senescence crabbe et al 2016 but the influence of these extreme events on leaf coloration have not been considered in current models the leaf coloration responses to extreme events should be included in the future leaf coloration models also the current model structure describe the responses of leaf coloration to air temperature but did not separate the different influence of daytime temperature and night time temperature during one day which have been found that the daytime temperature and night time temperature have contrasting effects on the timing of leaf senescence in northern hemisphere wu et al 2018 another possibility lies in the uncertainties caused by lc ground observations because leaf senescence is obviously more problematic to observe than the spring phenology and the leaf senescence process is protracted it is difficult for observers to assign single date to the leaf coloration event moreover the variation of leaf coloration among individual trees could also increase the uncertainty in leaf coloration at the population scale the uncertainty of the leaf coloration observations due to the observation methods and variability within population adds the inaccuracy to predict the leaf coloration dates the comparison of fitted parameter provided insights as regards the variety of phenological traits among tree species hankow willow pstart 14 1 h is the earliest of the studied tree species while simon poplar pstart 11 7 h is the latest species entering the leaf senescence process fig 5a though the photoperiod requirement difference between species reaches to more than 2 h the results are consistent with the previous finding in which the required photoperiod ranges from 11 h to 14 5 h archetti et al 2013 delpierre et al 2009a keenan and richardson 2015 tao et al 2018 vitasse et al 2011 yang et al 2012 siberian elm begins to accumulate the coldness when the air temperature is below a relatively low temperature 13 9 c while black locust begins that under 23 4 c these temperature thresholds are lower than usually inferred in autumn phenological modelling studies archetti et al 2013 delpierre et al 2009a keenan and richardson 2015 tao et al 2018 vitasse et al 2011 yang et al 2012 from the seminal work of sarvas 1972 a lot of experimental work has been conducted to determine effective temperature thresholds of budburst heide 1993 such experimental evidence is still missing as regards autumn phenological phases though warming experiments have clearly demonstrated a delaying effect of warm temperatures on the occurrence of senescence fu et al 2018 norby et al 2000 verdier et al 2014 for hankow willow and siberian elm the identification of negative slope between tls and the required critical cold temperature sum as a result of the calibration procedure confirmed our previous finding that higher temperature during the leaf season tls induces earlier leaf coloration and reduces coldness requirements liu et al 2018 interestingly fu et al 2018 also found that exposing european beech saplings to summer warming reduces cold degree hours accumulation to leaf senescence which also supports the negative relationship between tls and leaf coloration however black locust and simon poplar showed the opposite case in which the relations between tls and the required critical cold temperature sum are positive fig 5e this does not go the same direction with our previous study results liu et al 2018 because in this study we are in a prognostic model we can not use the lc dates as a limit for defining the leafy season during which summer temperature will influence the leaf coloration process contrary to the statistical approach used in the paper of liu et al 2018 however it shows that there is possibly another tls effect on leaf coloration which is similar with the results usually reported that warmer temperature delay leaf senescence gunderson et al 2012 liu et al 2016 marchin et al 2015 the effects of lpi on leaf coloration were found in 3 out of 4 species which shows more lpils will reduce the required critical cold temperature sum for hankow willow but increase the required critical value for siberian elm and simon poplar in best model fig 5f these mixed results obtained across species are in line with the general diversity of responses of autumn senescence to water availability reported in the literature while a combination of heat wave and soil drought may induce sudden leaf mortality in winter deciduous trees bréda et al 2006 the effects of milder water shortage are more ambiguous while estrella and menzel 2006 report an increase of the number of dry autumn days to be associated with an earlier occurrence of leaf coloration in some species one species out of the four species studied in germany xie et al 2015 recently report an opposite relation for some northeastern american species in line with this diversity of results we obtained different results as regards the link between water cues and leaf coloration in order to understand the influence of water conditions on leaf coloration beyond correlation with simple water input indexes such as the amount of precipitation estrella and menzel 2006 archetti et al 2013 or the number of dry days estrella and menzel 2006 xie et al 2015 we further tested process based model formulations including water balances index as a modulator the required cold temperature sum such as p pet indexes and a simple soil water balance not shown their modelling performance was always worse than obtained with the simple lpi index we note that establishing a meaningful water balance requires accessing information regarding both the soil type root depth and soil texture and the tree population structure e g leaf area index granier et al 1999 that we could not access in this work 4 3 evaluating local adaptation in leaf coloration traits with a model the current vast majority of autumn phenological process based models are parameterized and tested using integrated phenological data collected over independent tree populations by assigning the same model parameter values to all populations they hypothesize that local phenological adaptation that would result in a variation of model parameters among populations e g von wuehlisch et al 1995 is of low influence as compared with climate related adaptation of trees over large areas however if the phenology of one species is locally adapted to climate this method could result in flawed model calibration and validation chuine et al 1999 in our study we tested two types based on hyp a b of model parameterization to evaluate the possible local adaptation in leaf coloration the species specific models hyp a hypothesized that each species owns the common phenological traits same model parameters for one species when tested against ground observations at different sites the site specific models hyp b hypothesized that the parameters pstart tb x and y are the same for one species at different sites but the required critical cold temperature sum varying with sites von wuehlisch et al 1995 we evidenced those species specific models hyp a perform well me 0 while the site specific models hyp b were not efficient for all six models show me 0 the results suggest that i either the models are not precise enough to detect local adaptation ii or it may also be that autumn coloration is not a trait subject to local adaptation in the study species vitasse et al 2011 estimated the contribution of each genetic and climatic component explaining the variability of leaf unfolding date observed across common gardens see fig 3 in their paper and found that phenotypic variations of leaf phenology observed in situ for tree seedlings are mainly the consequence of plasticity due to climatic variation rather than genetic effects our results show that similar to leaf unfolding leaf senescence may also likely respond to climate stronger than to genetic difference conflicts of interests the authors declare no conflicts of interests acknowledgements the authors thank the meteorological

response to those characteristics whereas other approaches focus on wildlife dispersal behavior combining landscape structure and wildlife behavior e g movement food acquisition response to predation risk provides critical information for conservation and management of many species individual based models ibm are useful tools for evaluating the interaction between landscape characteristics and individual behaviors thereby providing insights into management and conservation our objective was to evaluate the effect of reductions in landscape connectivity on northern flying squirrel dispersal movements under alternative timber management scenarios within the modeling framework of a spatially explicit ibm we simulated timber harvests of 6 and 9 of old growth forest the primary habitat for this species distributed across 5 10 or 15 harvest locations we measured the influence of these scenarios upon landscape connectivity for flying squirrels landscapes with greater connectivity exhibited longer flying squirrel dispersal distances more sinuous dispersal paths and a greater total area of landscape utilization however connectivity was not directly correlated with habitat loss the harvest scenario with 6 harvest of old growth distributed among 15 harvest locations had the lowest connectivity index value despite other scenarios modeling a greater percentage of old growth loss the ibm demonstrated the importance of behaviors such as path tortuosity and movement rates in conjunction with landscape configuration in influencing the movement of dispersing individuals the spatially explicit ibm provided a framework to evaluate connectivity from a fine scale behavioral rather than structural perspective as well as to evaluate the distribution of new home range locations which could be a useful management tool when evaluating the influence of landscape heterogeneity and stochastic behavior on wildlife movement and dispersal keywords dispersal individual based model landscape connectivity spatially explicit timber harvest management 1 introduction dispersal is recognized as one of the most important aspects of maintaining functional metapopulations and genetic diversity through the facilitation of movement of individuals among habitat patches baguette et al 2013 fahrig and merriam 1985 frankham et al 2002 levins 1969 increasingly the concept of landscape connectivity the degree to which a landscape either impedes or facilitates movements of individual animals among habitat patches is utilized in resource management and in the development of resource management plans calabrese and fagan 2004 to account for the connection between land use and wildlife dispersal increased habitat fragmentation and decreased landscape connectivity often result in reduced dispersal rates heino and hanski 2001 schtickzelle et al 2006 schultz and crone 2001 and dispersal rates influence the spatial distribution and probability of persistence of populations diffendorfer et al 1995 fahrig and merriam 1994 as such quantifying landscape connectivity to assist in identifying key areas of conservation concern becomes an important management tool in maintaining landscape connectivity for wildlife populations quantifying landscape connectivity is a complex and difficult task that has received much attention in the literature tischendorf and fahrig 2000 zeller et al 2012 individual based modeling ibm that simulates realistic animal movement and landscape use has been identified as a promising approach to evaluating functional landscape connectivity baguette and van dyck 2007 grimm and railsback 2005 kanagaraj et al 2013 the advantage of an ibm over landscape connectivity indices e g least cost path modeling and other forms of graph theory logistic population growth models is the ability to incorporate the interaction between individual behavior and landscape characteristics grimm and railsback 2005 in an ibm animals move through the landscape in a step wise fashion and population properties emerge from the bottom up interactions of individuals with the landscape and with one another this is a different form of incorporating behavior into functional connectivity than for example a least cost path model in which animal omniscience is assumed least cost paths are calculated from the top down rather than from the bottom up and models are sensitive to subjective resistance values adriaensen et al 2003 indeed the spatially and temporally dynamic interactions between animal behavior and complex landscapes that are simulated in an ibm are an important driver of how wildlife move throughout a landscape zollner and lima 1999 when investigated within a spatially explicit modeling framework ibms can be a powerful tool to estimate landscape connectivity even being used as a means of testing the performance of alternative connectivity metrics simpkins et al 2018 the tongass national forest tnf in southeast alaska provides an opportunity to utilize an ibm to evaluate how landscape connectivity may influence movement of dispersing wildlife because of a long history of broad scale clearcut timber harvest in this forest in 1997 the tnf released the tongass land management plan tlmp usda forest service 1997 which established a system of old growth reserves to sustain breeding populations of old growth obligate wildlife and maintain connectivity through the facilitation of dispersal among remaining old growth stands usda forest service 1997 the efficacy of the small old growth reserve system in sustaining isolated breeding populations of the endemic prince of wales island flying squirrel glaucomys sabrinus griseifrons has been evaluated using logistic population modeling smith and person 2007 smith and person 2007 noted that without immigration from dispersal small reserves of old growth forest may not sustain populations of g s griseifrons for 100 years as a follow up smith et al 2011b estimated probability of persistence and modeled dispersal to determine the number of dispersing g s griseifrons juveniles and maximum effective distance between reserves that would maintain a breeding population in small old growth reserves 162 individual dispersing juveniles to sustain populations for 100 years smith et al 2011b also noted the importance of the location of reserves in facilitating connectivity and maintaining g s griseifrons populations these models however did not incorporate a spatially explicit modeling system individual stochastic behavior or the interaction between behavior and the landscape potentially limiting their utility in predicting the influence of landscape structure on individual choices and the probability of successful dispersal across a range of conditions our objective was to develop a dispersal model within the framework of a spatially explicit ibm to evaluate how landscape connectivity influenced dispersal movements of g s griseifrons under alternative management scenarios that reflect varying degrees of harvest and varying harvest configurations ongoing management in the tnf involves broad scale timber harvest of habitats for endemic wildlife species that require mature forest structure we predicted that greater values of structural landscape connectivity would be associated with the following patterns 1 longer euclidean dispersal distances between natal location and final home range pyare et al 2010 smith et al 2011b 2 straighter dispersal paths selonen and hanski 2004 3 shorter time to home range establishment flaherty et al 2008 4 greater proportion of time steps located in preferred habitat smith et al 2013 and 5 greater total area usage of the landscape smith 2013 results from simulations testing these a priori predictions can further our understanding of the factors that may limit dispersal through fragmented landscapes 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of modeled landscape we simulated dispersal and home range establishment of g s griseifrons on prince of wales island pow alaska nearly 25 of the world s temperate old growth rainforest is located in southeast alaska and managed by the tnf alaback 1991 the largest national forest in the united states the tnf is roughly 6 8 million ha comprised of shoreline and 500 near shore islands including pow at just over 6500 km2 timber harvest produced a multi aged mosaic of old growth variable aged and managed young growth muskeg and recent clearcut stands old growth stands consisted of mixed sitka spruce picea sitchensis and western hemlock tsuga heterophylla with some trees 300 years in age young growth contained dense spruce hemlock stands characterized by closed canopies ranged in age since harvest from 10 to 40 years and had not yet reached the complex uneven aged stage of old growth muskeg stands consisted of yellow cedar xanthocyparis nootkatensis and western red cedar thuja plicata with some lodgepole pine pinus contorta small western hemlock tsuga heterophylla and mountain hemlock t mertensiana in a mostly mesic area with patches of standing water young growth and muskeg were combined into a single marginal habitat type within our model clearcut stands were 10 years in age had not reached canopy closure and included an understory of skunk cabbage lysichitum americanum and vaccinium spp 2 2 simulation extent we digitized a representative 12 km2 landscape stratified by habitat types near the town of naukati 55 52 n 133 12 w fig 1 using a 1 8 m resolution aerial photograph of the landscape from 2008 and in close proximity to previous g s griseifrons field study locations flaherty et al 2008 2010a 2010b pyare et al 2010 smith et al 2011b the digitized landscape consisted of 873 ha of old growth forest 185 ha of marginal habitat 54 ha of clearcut and 20 ha of water with some roads extending into the landscape fig 2 the percentage of old growth habitat 70 3 is similar to that reported for the northern region of pow 70 5 usda forest service 1997 2 3 model description we used an individual based modeling framework search spatially explicit animal response to composition of habitat see full odd description in pauli et al 2013 to develop a model to simulate flying squirrel movements and home range establishment during dispersal the search framework has been applied to other study systems such as burmese python python bivittatus invasions mutascio et al 2017 and a reintroduction of american martens martes americana day et al in review search simulates dispersal by integrating complex user defined animal behavior with 4 independent spatially explicit vector based maps that regulate movement food availability predation risk and habitat suitability for individuals as they disperse through the landscape parameters associated with each of these maps varied according to habitat type to establish a home range dispersers explore the landscape using a correlated random walk in search of suitable habitat and store a list of potential settlement locations in memory in our application once a flying squirrel decided to establish a home range potential sites were prioritized for settlement based on proximity to present location predation risk and food availability lehmkuhl et al 2006 meyer et al 2007 smith et al 2004 following the dispersal period an inter dispersal period was simulated as a single time step during which reproduction and mortality took place dispersers that successfully established a home range remained on the map as resident potential breeders and were subject to stochastic mortality see appendix a in online materials thus creating a multi generation simulation the focus of our study was on the interaction between animal behavior and landscape structure therefore we simplified those demographic processes not necessary to address our research questions throughout each simulation we assumed a baseline density of flying squirrels lehmkuhl et al 2006 smith and nichols 2003 villa et al 1999 distributed homogenously throughout the suitable portions of the landscape then explicitly simulated an additional subset of residents and dispersers in addition to the baseline density we then modeled landscape occupancy as a binary variable either at available or above occupied the baseline density areas at the baseline density were available to one additional disperser for home range establishment mean home range size was 3 5 ha lehmkuhl et al 2006 witt 1992 upon a disperser establishing a home range and becoming an explicitly simulated resident hereafter simply resident the area comprised by that home range was considered occupied and therefore made unavailable to other dispersers though dispersers could cross through when a resident died the area comprising that home range location reverted to baseline density and was thus made available to a newly dispersing individual female residents underwent reproduction prior to each dispersal season resulting in a new generation of dispersers all residents were subject to a baseline rate of mortality throughout the simulation over time natural fluctuations in habitat available for settlement created a density dependent effect on dispersal and home range establishment without explicitly simulating the demographics of the total population of flying squirrels in the study area indeed the primary role of demographics in the model was to produce varying configurations of landscape occupancy and habitat availability because this has a direct effect on animal behavior we assigned all model parameters based on empirical values from the primary literature for g s griseifrons juveniles whenever possible because these are the dispersers in the populations much of the primary literature used reported data collected for this subspecies 14 of 24 parameters however we derived some parameters from studies that included adults or were conducted on related species of flying squirrel see appendix a in online materials as empirical data on dispersing juveniles is scarce for g s griseifrons in the literature some parameters could not be derived from literature e g mean vector length perceptual distance in old growth and for these parameters we used general values based on our personal observations from 10 years of research on g s griseifrons or related models of fine scale animal movement and calibrated these values to produce stable populations throughout the simulation period 2 4 input parameterization see appendix a in online materials for details related to parameterization of the model 2 4 1 demography at the start of each replicate we populated the landscape with 54 dispersers assigned to random locations within old growth habitat initializing replicates with 54 dispersers resulted in population fluctuations that did not exceed search s capacity for number of simulated dispersers on this particular landscape following year 1 the mean number of dispersers varied annually due to stochastic processes including mortality and establishment success resulting in a mean of 46 3 sd 15 1 dispersal events per year over each 30 year replicate we simulated a mean of 1341 sd 146 5 dispersal events the emergent fluctuation of annual number of dispersers yielded diverse configurations of habitat availability over the course of one replicate each dispersal period was divided into 4 hr time steps and continued for up to 60 days or until all dispersers died or established a home range we excluded the processes of immigration to and emigration from the simulated population and therefore assumed population closure in terms of dispersal female residents produced 2 offspring per year and all females reproduced because reproduction occurred once per year when all individuals in the population would have reached breeding age age class ii villa et al 1999 all residents were subject to an annual mortality rate of 0 375 lehmkuhl et al 2006 smith and nichols 2003 2 4 2 movement movement parameters derived from published studies using spool surveys to track fine scale movements were from either the same location as this model flaherty et al 2008 or similar landscapes managed for timber harvest selonen and hanski 2004 and varied across habitat types within each habitat type g s griseifrons differed in the distance travelled per 4 hr time step with greater distances travelled in old growth and marginal habitat compared to clearcut habitat distances were based on spool surveys in this landscape that measured vector length of g s griseifrons freely moving in the different habitats flaherty et al 2008 selonen and hanski 2004 we used identical movement correlation values for all habitat types selonen and hanski 2004 energy used per time step was greater for clearcut stands than old growth and marginal habitat 1 64 1 ratio because flying squirrels move with less efficiency via quadrupedal as opposed to glissant locomotion flaherty et al 2008 additionally g s griseifrons had a larger perceptual distance in clearcut stands compared to marginal habitat with old growth habitat given the lowest value flaherty et al 2008 water in this case the ocean was considered impermeable to g s griseifrons all roads present within the simulation area were logging roads that we considered narrow enough to be inconsequential to movement by flying squirrels through a given habitat type wps personal observation 2 4 3 food availability the probability of encountering food per time step varied by habitat type flaherty et al 2010a b whereas the amount of energy gained from locating food 2 g 1 sd remained constant across habitat types probability of finding food was 1 in old growth habitat and 0 5 for marginal and clearcut habitats because clearcut habitats continue to produce mycorrhizal fungi a preferred food source for several years post harvest flaherty et al 2010b 2 4 4 predation risk predation risk varied across habitat types old growth habitat had the lowest risk of predation per time step whereas marginal habitat had intermediate levels and clearcuts had the highest risk of predation per time step lehmkuhl et al 2006 smith and nichols 2003 smith 2012 smc2 these estimates were based on studies of adult flying squirrel mortality no data exists on juvenile mortality rates during dispersal or by forest type 2 4 5 habitat suitability old growth and marginal habitat were considered suitable for home range establishment and clearcut habitat was considered unsuitable smith and nichols 2003 while marginal habitat was defined as suitable high predation risk and low food availability in this habitat type affected the prioritization of potential settlement locations the habitat suitability layer also managed interactions with conspecifics locations occupied by residents were unavailable to dispersers and therefore as occupancy on the landscape increased available locations for home range establishment decreased 2 5 experimental design and analysis to evaluate impacts of landscape connectivity on g s griseifrons dispersal we simulated 1 control scenario using the 2008 landscape configuration on pow and 6 alternative hypothetical landscape scenarios of timber harvest fig 2 each alternative scenario had a unique combination of the total clearcut harvest of old growth and the number of harvest sites used to obtain the subsequent harvest we based the 6 harvest of old growth forest 52 ha on the big thorne harvest plan which proposed a 6 loss of productive old growth forest over 10 years in the final record of decision usda forest service 2013 we then simulated a 9 loss of old growth forest 78 ha from the current landscape to evaluate how a further increase in the harvest would influence connectivity and g s griseifrons dispersal for each of these reduction scenarios we varied the harvest treatment with 5 10 and 15 separate harvests to evaluate how the number of harvest locations influenced connectivity and g s griseifrons dispersal within each reduction scenario all replicates within each scenario contained the same landscape configuration but varying social configurations i e starting locations of individual squirrels we established new clearcuts in random locations adjacent to existing managed or clearcut stands as indicated by the big thorne harvest plan to reduce the need for construction of new logging roads i e roadless rule and to ensure economic feasibility all other parameters associated with search modeling were held constant across all scenarios 2 5 1 analysis of model results for each replicate of each of the 7 harvest scenarios 4 replicates per scenario we simulated 30 years of dispersal and home range establishment and considered each year to be a replicate nested within the landscape replicates for simplicity and because evidence for behavioral and demographic differences between sexes is inconsistent in the literature we parameterized both sexes identically and essentially eliminated this variable from the model we calculated dispersal metrics for only those juveniles that successfully established home ranges and calculated the mean value for each outcome variable over the course of a simulation year to obtain a single mean value for each year over the course of a 30 yr replicate each year was considered a nested replicate and incorporated into a mixed effects regression analysis by including year as a random factor this resulted in a total of 4 independent landscape replicates consisting of 30 nested replicates each for a total of 120 nested replicates per harvest scenario each containing approximately 46 dispersers per year we calculated 5 dispersal metrics for individuals who successfully established home ranges straight line dispersal distance dd prediction 1 tortuosity prediction 2 number of time steps to establishment tse prediction 3 number of time steps spent in clearcut marginal and old growth habitats prediction 4 and a kernel density estimate of landscape usage prediction 5 we measured dd from the center of each disperser s natal home range to the center of their final home range we calculated tortuosity of movement using the following equation 1 tortuosity t di dd where d is equal to the distance moved during each time step i a higher tortuosity value indicates a more sinuous path between the natal location and final home range we evaluated differences among individuals in their use of habitats by calculating the proportion of time steps spent in each habitat to evaluate the extent to which individuals utilized the landscape we produced a 75 kernel density estimate kde gitzen and millspaugh 2003 hemson et al 2005 based on the point location data of each individual for each time step using arcgis v 10 1 esri redlands ca we used the area ha of the 75 kde as a metric of landscape usage we calculated the above metrics for each of the 30 years in each scenario we analyzed results using repeated measures analysis of variance anova and mixed effects linear regression to determine if harvest scenario had an effect on each response variable see table 1 and whether response variables showed a relationship with structural landscape connectivity to quantify structural connectivity across landscape scenarios we used fragstats version 4 2 mcgarigal et al 2002 to calculate an area weighted mean square radius of gyration gyrate am at the landscape scale frazier and wang 2013 this value which we term the traversability index has also been referred to as correlation length and has been used as a surrogate for landscape connectivity keitt et al 1997 it represents the average distance an individual is capable of dispersing before reaching a barrier within the mixed effects linear regression we modeled year as a random variable to account for non independence of data within each replicate to control for the effect of the density of residents on response variables we also included annual resident population size as an explanatory nuisance variable in each regression we used a probability of α 0 05 to indicate statistical significance 2 5 2 sensitivity analysis to investigate the sensitivity of our chosen response variables to uncertainty in model parameterization we conducted local sensitivity analysis on 4 input variables associated with movement that we deemed most likely to influence model processes these included habitat border crossing probabilities mean step length msl mean vector length mvl benhamou 2004 and perceptual distance we chose at least 5 values for each input parameter table 2 and ran 20 1 year replicates for each value while holding all other variables constant we used the src function in the sensitivity package v 1 14 pujol et al 2017 in r v 3 2 3 to calculate standardized regression coefficients src using 10 000 bootstrap replicates for each combination of input parameter and response variable 3 results 3 1 traversability the scenario in which no harvest was added had the highest traversability index value 973 table 1 the traversability index value tiv was nearly identical for 6 harvest of old growth with 5 harvest locations 923 tiv and 6 harvest of old growth with 10 harvest locations 924 tiv the harvest scenario with 6 harvest of old growth with 15 harvest locations had the lowest tiv of all 7 scenarios 893 tiv among the 9 harvest scenarios 5 harvest locations had the highest tiv 907 tiv followed by 15 harvest locations 901 tiv and 10 harvest locations 897 tiv 3 2 prediction 1 greater values of structural landscape connectivity i e traversability would be associated with longer euclidean dispersal distances between natal location and final

sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis indicated that of the 4 movement parameters tested msl was most responsible for driving processes observed in response variables across the 4 response variables we included dispersal distance time steps tortuosity and proportion of time in clearcut msl had a mean srcabs 0 256 followed by mvl 0 076 of the response metrics msl had the greatest effect on dispersal distance with src 0 405 overall response variables were not sensitive to variations in border crossing probabilities and perceptual distance fig 4 4 discussion our application of the search ibm demonstrates a powerful approach to evaluate landscape connectivity based on the emergent properties that arise from individual animal movements and their interactions with the landscape and with conspecifics during dispersal and home range establishment we were able to model movements of g s griseifrons through complex realistic landscapes at fine scale resolutions and produce dispersal distances comparable to those reported empirically for similar species selonen and hanski 2004 individual based modeling frameworks are valuable for investigating the combination of behavioral complexity spatial realism and fine scale resolution for example the almass topping et al 2003 framework has been used to compare the impacts of agricultural scenarios upon field vole populations microtus agrestis in highly realistic virtual landscapes in which individuals interact with conspecifics and habitat configurations similarly j walk gardner and gustafson 2004 has been used to demonstrate how landscape structure and composition can influence dispersal of reintroduced american martens martes americana rangeshifter bocedi et al 2014 uses a stochastic movement simulator palmer et al 2011 to scale up the implications of movement behavior to understand how species distributions could shift in response to climate change our application of the search framework illustrates its utility for exploring landscape connectivity as a process that emerges from complex behaviors and interactions between animals and landscapes indeed data from tracking spools illustrated that landscape resistance alone was not a sufficient surrogate for how behavior interacts with landscape structure flaherty et al 2008 our model demonstrated how the movement of g s griseifrons was directly influenced by landscape composition and configuration and varied among alternate timber harvest scenarios other studies have argued for the existence of a threshold limit to the amount of fragmentation that allows for occupancy or den use by g s griseifrons pyare et al 2010 shanley et al 2013 prior to exceeding this fragmentation threshold however our simulation results indicate that landscape configuration may be a primary driver of functional landscape connectivity i e traversability our model results identified a suite of landscape and behavioral metrics beyond landscape composition that may improve our understanding of landscape connectivity careful consideration of the interaction of dispersal behavior with landscape composition and configuration using ibm tools can inform management decisions regarding future harvests specifically our results demonstrate that the movement of dispersing g s griseifrons is influenced by the number size or location of future timber sales which ultimately determines the functional connectivity of the landscape scheibe et al 2006 smith et al 2011b smith et al 2011b concluded that underlying assumptions of the tlmp old growth strategy were untenable because the number of dispersers necessary to mitigate effective distances among reserves 50 of the reserves were isolated exceeded the minimum number of dispersers that could be consistently produced by breeding populations of g s griseifrons in small old growth reserves our results illustrate how landscape composition and configuration explicitly influence the movement of individual g s griseifrons e g dispersal distance tortuosity therefore the detrimental effects of small reserve size and long inter reserve distances may potentially be exacerbated by poor landscape connectivity within the reserves themselves due to habitat configuration reduced landscape connectivity may lead to reductions in occupancy and therefore in the number of emigrants capable of traveling between reserves smith and person 2007 smith et al 2011b the traversability index demonstrated that an increase in area harvested might not necessarily reduce the structural landscape connectivity for g s griseifrons harvest locations in addition to total harvest area also influenced overall connectivity of the map as demonstrated by one of the 6 harvest scenarios producing lower traversability values than the 9 harvest scenarios this result is likely due to the spatial configuration of habitat types across alternative scenarios and our results present just 1 example where habitat configuration was more important than composition thus species management plans designed solely around minimizing loss of habitat i e spatially implicit or aspatial analysis might not be sufficient when designing conservation strategies for species of concern calabrese and fagan 2004 heller and zavaleta 2009 pascual hortal and saura 2006 smith 2013 smith et al 2011a the dispersal distance metric dd indicated that increased fragmentation reduced the movement capabilities of g s griseifrons the dd from natal location to final home range showed a strong positive relationship with the traversability index indicating that individuals established home ranges farther from their natal location as habitat connectivity increased this result supports previous research that shows decreased emigration rates of g s griseifrons with increased fragmentation pyare et al 2010 smith et al 2011b and greater homing success with greater connectivity smith et al 2011a whereas no area on the study landscape was structurally isolated i e habitat island small corridors created through increased harvest limited the movement of dispersers throughout the map creating functionally isolated populations on the landscape smith et al 2011b the restriction of long distance dispersal may lead to local extinctions fahrig and merriam 1994 gilpin and hanski 2012 or a decrease in genetic variability gilpin and gilpin 1991 keller and largiader 2003 trakhtenbrot et al 2005 of an already isolated subspecies bidlack and cook 2001 threatening the long term viability of the metapopulation thomas 2000 further indication of habitat fragmentation limiting the movement of g s griseifrons is evident through our measures of tortuosity and landscape usage the tortuosity values suggest that individuals traveled in more sinuous routes while searching for a home range in more connected landscapes this could be driven by a more contiguous landscape facilitating freer movement e g forays as individuals explored for potential settlement locations in contrast more fragmented landscapes limit the opportunities to search in all directions for a home range and instead funnel individuals in straighter paths through corridor like landscape features of preferred habitat shanley et al 2013 smith et al 2013 smc3 this is further supported by the greater kde values observed on more connected landscapes which in conjunction with the tortuosity metric suggests a greater area of the landscape used by g s griseifrons as connectivity increased our results did not identify a clear influence of landscape connectivity on time steps to establishment tse or the amount of time spent in each habitat type while tse did have a positive relationship with traversability there was also an interaction effect with resident population size as traversability increased dispersal was more successful and the resulting high resident population densities following years of successful dispersal rates may have resulted in longer search times to home range establishment constraints within our modeling framework limited the scope of our study to the relationships between animal behavior and landscape structure for example we simulated only a subset of total potential dispersers while assuming an underlying landscape that was near carrying capacity due to computational constraints we simulated alternative management scenarios for a single landscape such limitations represent a tradeoff of breadth of simulation areas for spatial and behavioral complexity and realism uncertainty around some behavioral parameters also limited model outputs to a relative rather than predictive capacity radchuk et al 2016 for example mean distances traveled over a 4 hr time step are difficult to extract from empirical data and sensitivity analysis indicated that mean step lengths are partly responsible for the variation in model outputs future work may focus on additional empirical investigation of fine scale movement patterns of g s griseifrons using radio telemetry evaluating connectivity and landscape resistance in fragmented landscapes using genetic analysis and adjusting our model to be more computationally efficient to increase the power of model inference while maintaining complexity incorporating behavior of the individual as well as landscape configuration into conservation planning maximizes the potential for dispersal and metapopulation persistence lima and zollner 1996 species specific behaviors and random stochasticity play an important role in influencing population structure in a fragmented landscape clobert et al 2009 king and with 2002 lima and zollner 1996 van dyck and baguette 2005 individual based modeling is a valuable tool for investigating animal behaviors and movements across landscapes to identify suitable areas for future harvest treatments an active monitoring program coupled with an individual based model that tracks dispersal movements

25121,landscape connectivity is a key component for successful dispersal of wildlife many approaches to quantify landscape connectivity utilize landscape characteristics and wildlife behavior in response to those characteristics whereas other approaches focus on wildlife dispersal behavior combining landscape structure and wildlife behavior e g movement food acquisition response to predation risk provides critical information for conservation and management of many species individual based models ibm are useful tools for evaluating the interaction between landscape characteristics and individual behaviors thereby providing insights into management and conservation our objective was to evaluate the effect of reductions in landscape connectivity on northern flying squirrel dispersal movements under alternative timber management scenarios within the modeling framework of a spatially explicit ibm we simulated timber harvests of 6 and 9 of old growth forest the primary habitat for this species distributed across 5 10 or 15 harvest locations we measured the influence of these scenarios upon landscape connectivity for flying squirrels landscapes with greater connectivity exhibited longer flying squirrel dispersal distances more sinuous dispersal paths and a greater total area of landscape utilization however connectivity was not directly correlated with habitat loss the harvest scenario with 6 harvest of old growth distributed among 15 harvest locations had the lowest connectivity index value despite other scenarios modeling a greater percentage of old growth loss the ibm demonstrated the importance of behaviors such as path tortuosity and movement rates in conjunction with landscape configuration in influencing the movement of dispersing individuals the spatially explicit ibm provided a framework to evaluate connectivity from a fine scale behavioral rather than structural perspective as well as to evaluate the distribution of new home range locations which could be a useful management tool when evaluating the influence of landscape heterogeneity and stochastic behavior on wildlife movement and dispersal keywords dispersal individual based model landscape connectivity spatially explicit timber harvest management 1 introduction dispersal is recognized as one of the most important aspects of maintaining functional metapopulations and genetic diversity through the facilitation of movement of individuals among habitat patches baguette et al 2013 fahrig and merriam 1985 frankham et al 2002 levins 1969 increasingly the concept of landscape connectivity the degree to which a landscape either impedes or facilitates movements of individual animals among habitat patches is utilized in resource management and in the development of resource management plans calabrese and fagan 2004 to account for the connection between land use and wildlife dispersal increased habitat fragmentation and decreased landscape connectivity often result in reduced dispersal rates heino and hanski 2001 schtickzelle et al 2006 schultz and crone 2001 and dispersal rates influence the spatial distribution and probability of persistence of populations diffendorfer et al 1995 fahrig and merriam 1994 as such quantifying landscape connectivity to assist in identifying key areas of conservation concern becomes an important management tool in maintaining landscape connectivity for wildlife populations quantifying landscape connectivity is a complex and difficult task that has received much attention in the literature tischendorf and fahrig 2000 zeller et al 2012 individual based modeling ibm that simulates realistic animal movement and landscape use has been identified as a promising approach to evaluating functional landscape connectivity baguette and van dyck 2007 grimm and railsback 2005 kanagaraj et al 2013 the advantage of an ibm over landscape connectivity indices e g least cost path modeling and other forms of graph theory logistic population growth models is the ability to incorporate the interaction between individual behavior and landscape characteristics grimm and railsback 2005 in an ibm animals move through the landscape in a step wise fashion and population properties emerge from the bottom up interactions of individuals with the landscape and with one another this is a different form of incorporating behavior into functional connectivity than for example a least cost path model in which animal omniscience is assumed least cost paths are calculated from the top down rather than from the bottom up and models are sensitive to subjective resistance values adriaensen et al 2003 indeed the spatially and temporally dynamic interactions between animal behavior and complex landscapes that are simulated in an ibm are an important driver of how wildlife move throughout a landscape zollner and lima 1999 when investigated within a spatially explicit modeling framework ibms can be a powerful tool to estimate landscape connectivity even being used as a means of testing the performance of alternative connectivity metrics simpkins et al 2018 the tongass national forest tnf in southeast alaska provides an opportunity to utilize an ibm to evaluate how landscape connectivity may influence movement of dispersing wildlife because of a long history of broad scale clearcut timber harvest in this forest in 1997 the tnf released the tongass land management plan tlmp usda forest service 1997 which established a system of old growth reserves to sustain breeding populations of old growth obligate wildlife and maintain connectivity through the facilitation of dispersal among remaining old growth stands usda forest service 1997 the efficacy of the small old growth reserve system in sustaining isolated breeding populations of the endemic prince of wales island flying squirrel glaucomys sabrinus griseifrons has been evaluated using logistic population modeling smith and person 2007 smith and person 2007 noted that without immigration from dispersal small reserves of old growth forest may not sustain populations of g s griseifrons for 100 years as a follow up smith et al 2011b estimated probability of persistence and modeled dispersal to determine the number of dispersing g s griseifrons juveniles and maximum effective distance between reserves that would maintain a breeding population in small old growth reserves 162 individual dispersing juveniles to sustain populations for 100 years smith et al 2011b also noted the importance of the location of reserves in facilitating connectivity and maintaining g s griseifrons populations these models however did not incorporate a spatially explicit modeling system individual stochastic behavior or the interaction between behavior and the landscape potentially limiting their utility in predicting the influence of landscape structure on individual choices and the probability of successful dispersal across a range of conditions our objective was to develop a dispersal model within the framework of a spatially explicit ibm to evaluate how landscape connectivity influenced dispersal movements of g s griseifrons under alternative management scenarios that reflect varying degrees of harvest and varying harvest configurations ongoing management in the tnf involves broad scale timber harvest of habitats for endemic wildlife species that require mature forest structure we predicted that greater values of structural landscape connectivity would be associated with the following patterns 1 longer euclidean dispersal distances between natal location and final home range pyare et al 2010 smith et al 2011b 2 straighter dispersal paths selonen and hanski 2004 3 shorter time to home range establishment flaherty et al 2008 4 greater proportion of time steps located in preferred habitat smith et al 2013 and 5 greater total area usage of the landscape smith 2013 results from simulations testing these a priori predictions can further our understanding of the factors that may limit dispersal through fragmented landscapes 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of modeled landscape we simulated dispersal and home range establishment of g s griseifrons on prince of wales island pow alaska nearly 25 of the world s temperate old growth rainforest is located in southeast alaska and managed by the tnf alaback 1991 the largest national forest in the united states the tnf is roughly 6 8 million ha comprised of shoreline and 500 near shore islands including pow at just over 6500 km2 timber harvest produced a multi aged mosaic of old growth variable aged and managed young growth muskeg and recent clearcut stands old growth stands consisted of mixed sitka spruce picea sitchensis and western hemlock tsuga heterophylla with some trees 300 years in age young growth contained dense spruce hemlock stands characterized by closed canopies ranged in age since harvest from 10 to 40 years and had not yet reached the complex uneven aged stage of old growth muskeg stands consisted of yellow cedar xanthocyparis nootkatensis and western red cedar thuja plicata with some lodgepole pine pinus contorta small western hemlock tsuga heterophylla and mountain hemlock t mertensiana in a mostly mesic area with patches of standing water young growth and muskeg were combined into a single marginal habitat type within our model clearcut stands were 10 years in age had not reached canopy closure and included an understory of skunk cabbage lysichitum americanum and vaccinium spp 2 2 simulation extent we digitized a representative 12 km2 landscape stratified by habitat types near the town of naukati 55 52 n 133 12 w fig 1 using a 1 8 m resolution aerial photograph of the landscape from 2008 and in close proximity to previous g s griseifrons field study locations flaherty et al 2008 2010a 2010b pyare et al 2010 smith et al 2011b the digitized landscape consisted of 873 ha of old growth forest 185 ha of marginal habitat 54 ha of clearcut and 20 ha of water with some roads extending into the landscape fig 2 the percentage of old growth habitat 70 3 is similar to that reported for the northern region of pow 70 5 usda forest service 1997 2 3 model description we used an individual based modeling framework search spatially explicit animal response to composition of habitat see full odd description in pauli et al 2013 to develop a model to simulate flying squirrel movements and home range establishment during dispersal the search framework has been applied to other study systems such as burmese python python bivittatus invasions mutascio et al 2017 and a reintroduction of american martens martes americana day et al in review search simulates dispersal by integrating complex user defined animal behavior with 4 independent spatially explicit vector based maps that regulate movement food availability predation risk and habitat suitability for individuals as they disperse through the landscape parameters associated with each of these maps varied according to habitat type to establish a home range dispersers explore the landscape using a correlated random walk in search of suitable habitat and store a list of potential settlement locations in memory in our application once a flying squirrel decided to establish a home range potential sites were prioritized for settlement based on proximity to present location predation risk and food availability lehmkuhl et al 2006 meyer et al 2007 smith et al 2004 following the dispersal period an inter dispersal period was simulated as a single time step during which reproduction and mortality took place dispersers that successfully established a home range remained on the map as resident potential breeders and were subject to stochastic mortality see appendix a in online materials thus creating a multi generation simulation the focus of our study was on the interaction between animal behavior and landscape structure therefore we simplified those demographic processes not necessary to address our research questions throughout each simulation we assumed a baseline density of flying squirrels lehmkuhl et al 2006 smith and nichols 2003 villa et al 1999 distributed homogenously throughout the suitable portions of the landscape then explicitly simulated an additional subset of residents and dispersers in addition to the baseline density we then modeled landscape occupancy as a binary variable either at available or above occupied the baseline density areas at the baseline density were available to one additional disperser for home range establishment mean home range size was 3 5 ha lehmkuhl et al 2006 witt 1992 upon a disperser establishing a home range and becoming an explicitly simulated resident hereafter simply resident the area comprised by that home range was considered occupied and therefore made unavailable to other dispersers though dispersers could cross through when a resident died the area comprising that home range location reverted to baseline density and was thus made available to a newly dispersing individual female residents underwent reproduction prior to each dispersal season resulting in a new generation of dispersers all residents were subject to a baseline rate of mortality throughout the simulation over time natural fluctuations in habitat available for settlement created a density dependent effect on dispersal and home range establishment without explicitly simulating the demographics of the total population of flying squirrels in the study area indeed the primary role of demographics in the model was to produce varying configurations of landscape occupancy and habitat availability because this has a direct effect on animal behavior we assigned all model parameters based on empirical values from the primary literature for g s griseifrons juveniles whenever possible because these are the dispersers in the populations much of the primary literature used reported data collected for this subspecies 14 of 24 parameters however we derived some parameters from studies that included adults or were conducted on related species of flying squirrel see appendix a in online materials as empirical data on dispersing juveniles is scarce for g s griseifrons in the literature some parameters could not be derived from literature e g mean vector length perceptual distance in old growth and for these parameters we used general values based on our personal observations from 10 years of research on g s griseifrons or related models of fine scale animal movement and calibrated these values to produce stable populations throughout the simulation period 2 4 input parameterization see appendix a in online materials for details related to parameterization of the model 2 4 1 demography at the start of each replicate we populated the landscape with 54 dispersers assigned to random locations within old growth habitat initializing replicates with 54 dispersers resulted in population fluctuations that did not exceed search s capacity for number of simulated dispersers on this particular landscape following year 1 the mean number of dispersers varied annually due to stochastic processes including mortality and establishment success resulting in a mean of 46 3 sd 15 1 dispersal events per year over each 30 year replicate we simulated a mean of 1341 sd 146 5 dispersal events the emergent fluctuation of annual number of dispersers yielded diverse configurations of habitat availability over the course of one replicate each dispersal period was divided into 4 hr time steps and continued for up to 60 days or until all dispersers died or established a home range we excluded the processes of immigration to and emigration from the simulated population and therefore assumed population closure in terms of dispersal female residents produced 2 offspring per year and all females reproduced because reproduction occurred once per year when all individuals in the population would have reached breeding age age class ii villa et al 1999 all residents were subject to an annual mortality rate of 0 375 lehmkuhl et al 2006 smith and nichols 2003 2 4 2 movement movement parameters derived from published studies using spool surveys to track fine scale movements were from either the same location as this model flaherty et al 2008 or similar landscapes managed for timber harvest selonen and hanski 2004 and varied across habitat types within each habitat type g s griseifrons differed in the distance travelled per 4 hr time step with greater distances travelled in old growth and marginal habitat compared to clearcut habitat distances were based on spool surveys in this landscape that measured vector length of g s griseifrons freely moving in the different habitats flaherty et al 2008 selonen and hanski 2004 we used identical movement correlation values for all habitat types selonen and hanski 2004 energy used per time step was greater for clearcut stands than old growth and marginal habitat 1 64 1 ratio because flying squirrels move with less efficiency via quadrupedal as opposed to glissant locomotion flaherty et al 2008 additionally g s griseifrons had a larger perceptual distance in clearcut stands compared to marginal habitat with old growth habitat given the lowest value flaherty et al 2008 water in this case the ocean was considered impermeable to g s griseifrons all roads present within the simulation area were logging roads that we considered narrow enough to be inconsequential to movement by flying squirrels through a given habitat type wps personal observation 2 4 3 food availability the probability of encountering food per time step varied by habitat type flaherty et al 2010a b whereas the amount of energy gained from locating food 2 g 1 sd remained constant across habitat types probability of finding food was 1 in old growth habitat and 0 5 for marginal and clearcut habitats because clearcut habitats continue to produce mycorrhizal fungi a preferred food source for several years post harvest flaherty et al 2010b 2 4 4 predation risk predation risk varied across habitat types old growth habitat had the lowest risk of predation per time step whereas marginal habitat had intermediate levels and clearcuts had the highest risk of predation per time step lehmkuhl et al 2006 smith and nichols 2003 smith 2012 smc2 these estimates were based on studies of adult flying squirrel mortality no data exists on juvenile mortality rates during dispersal or by forest type 2 4 5 habitat suitability old growth and marginal habitat were considered suitable for home range establishment and clearcut habitat was considered unsuitable smith and nichols 2003 while marginal habitat was defined as suitable high predation risk and low food availability in this habitat type affected the prioritization of potential settlement locations the habitat suitability layer also managed interactions with conspecifics locations occupied by residents were unavailable to dispersers and therefore as occupancy on the landscape increased available locations for home range establishment decreased 2 5 experimental design and analysis to evaluate impacts of landscape connectivity on g s griseifrons dispersal we simulated 1 control scenario using the 2008 landscape configuration on pow and 6 alternative hypothetical landscape scenarios of timber harvest fig 2 each alternative scenario had a unique combination of the total clearcut harvest of old growth and the number of harvest sites used to obtain the subsequent harvest we based the 6 harvest of old growth forest 52 ha on the big thorne harvest plan which proposed a 6 loss of productive old growth forest over 10 years in the final record of decision usda forest service 2013 we then simulated a 9 loss of old growth forest 78 ha from the current landscape to evaluate how a further increase in the harvest would influence connectivity and g s griseifrons dispersal for each of these reduction scenarios we varied the harvest treatment with 5 10 and 15 separate harvests to evaluate how the number of harvest locations influenced connectivity and g s griseifrons dispersal within each reduction scenario all replicates within each scenario contained the same landscape configuration but varying social configurations i e starting locations of individual squirrels we established new clearcuts in random locations adjacent to existing managed or clearcut stands as indicated by the big thorne harvest plan to reduce the need for construction of new logging roads i e roadless rule and to ensure economic feasibility all other parameters associated with search modeling were held constant across all scenarios 2 5 1 analysis of model results for each replicate of each of the 7 harvest scenarios 4 replicates per scenario we simulated 30 years of dispersal and home range establishment and considered each year to be a replicate nested within the landscape replicates for simplicity and because evidence for behavioral and demographic differences between sexes is inconsistent in the literature we parameterized both sexes identically and essentially eliminated this variable from the model we calculated dispersal metrics for only those juveniles that successfully established home ranges and calculated the mean value for each outcome variable over the course of a simulation year to obtain a single mean value for each year over the course of a 30 yr replicate each year was considered a nested replicate and incorporated into a mixed effects regression analysis by including year as a random factor this resulted in a total of 4 independent landscape replicates consisting of 30 nested replicates each for a total of 120 nested replicates per harvest scenario each containing approximately 46 dispersers per year we calculated 5 dispersal metrics for individuals who successfully established home ranges straight line dispersal distance dd prediction 1 tortuosity prediction 2 number of time steps to establishment tse prediction 3 number of time steps spent in clearcut marginal and old growth habitats prediction 4 and a kernel density estimate of landscape usage prediction 5 we measured dd from the center of each disperser s natal home range to the center of their final home range we calculated tortuosity of movement using the following equation 1 tortuosity t di dd where d is equal to the distance moved during each time step i a higher tortuosity value indicates a more sinuous path between the natal location and final home range we evaluated differences among individuals in their use of habitats by calculating the proportion of time steps spent in each habitat to evaluate the extent to which individuals utilized the landscape we produced a 75 kernel density estimate kde gitzen and millspaugh 2003 hemson et al 2005 based on the point location data of each individual for each time step using arcgis v 10 1 esri redlands ca we used the area ha of the 75 kde as a metric of landscape usage we calculated the above metrics for each of the 30 years in each scenario we analyzed results using repeated measures analysis of variance anova and mixed effects linear regression to determine if harvest scenario had an effect on each response variable see table 1 and whether response variables showed a relationship with structural landscape connectivity to quantify structural connectivity across landscape scenarios we used fragstats version 4 2 mcgarigal et al 2002 to calculate an area weighted mean square radius of gyration gyrate am at the landscape scale frazier and wang 2013 this value which we term the traversability index has also been referred to as correlation length and has been used as a surrogate for landscape connectivity keitt et al 1997 it represents the average distance an individual is capable of dispersing before reaching a barrier within the mixed effects linear regression we modeled year as a random variable to account for non independence of data within each replicate to control for the effect of the density of residents on response variables we also included annual resident population size as an explanatory nuisance variable in each regression we used a probability of α 0 05 to indicate statistical significance 2 5 2 sensitivity analysis to investigate the sensitivity of our chosen response variables to uncertainty in model parameterization we conducted local sensitivity analysis on 4 input variables associated with movement that we deemed most likely to influence model processes these included habitat border crossing probabilities mean step length msl mean vector length mvl benhamou 2004 and perceptual distance we chose at least 5 values for each input parameter table 2 and ran 20 1 year replicates for each value while holding all other variables constant we used the src function in the sensitivity package v 1 14 pujol et al 2017 in r v 3 2 3 to calculate standardized regression coefficients src using 10 000 bootstrap replicates for each combination of input parameter and response variable 3 results 3 1 traversability the scenario in which no harvest was added had the highest traversability index value 973 table 1 the traversability index value tiv was nearly identical for 6 harvest of old growth with 5 harvest locations 923 tiv and 6 harvest of old growth with 10 harvest locations 924 tiv the harvest scenario with 6 harvest of old growth with 15 harvest locations had the lowest tiv of all 7 scenarios 893 tiv among the 9 harvest scenarios 5 harvest locations had the highest tiv 907 tiv followed by 15 harvest locations 901 tiv and 10 harvest locations 897 tiv 3 2 prediction 1 greater values of structural landscape connectivity i e traversability would be associated with longer euclidean dispersal distances between natal location and final

sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis indicated that of the 4 movement parameters tested msl was most responsible for driving processes observed in response variables across the 4 response variables we included dispersal distance time steps tortuosity and proportion of time in clearcut msl had a mean srcabs 0 256 followed by mvl 0 076 of the response metrics msl had the greatest effect on dispersal distance with src 0 405 overall response variables were not sensitive to variations in border crossing probabilities and perceptual distance fig 4 4 discussion our application of the search ibm demonstrates a powerful approach to evaluate landscape connectivity based on the emergent properties that arise from individual animal movements and their interactions with the landscape and with conspecifics during dispersal and home range establishment we were able to model movements of g s griseifrons through complex realistic landscapes at fine scale resolutions and produce dispersal distances comparable to those reported empirically for similar species selonen and hanski 2004 individual based modeling frameworks are valuable for investigating the combination of behavioral complexity spatial realism and fine scale resolution for example the almass topping et al 2003 framework has been used to compare the impacts of agricultural scenarios upon field vole populations microtus agrestis in highly realistic virtual landscapes in which individuals interact with conspecifics and habitat configurations similarly j walk gardner and gustafson 2004 has been used to demonstrate how landscape structure and composition can influence dispersal of reintroduced american martens martes americana rangeshifter bocedi et al 2014 uses a stochastic movement simulator palmer et al 2011 to scale up the implications of movement behavior to understand how species distributions could shift in response to climate change our application of the search framework illustrates its utility for exploring landscape connectivity as a process that emerges from complex behaviors and interactions between animals and landscapes indeed data from tracking spools illustrated that landscape resistance alone was not a sufficient surrogate for how behavior interacts with landscape structure flaherty et al 2008 our model demonstrated how the movement of g s griseifrons was directly influenced by landscape composition and configuration and varied among alternate timber harvest scenarios other studies have argued for the existence of a threshold limit to the amount of fragmentation that allows for occupancy or den use by g s griseifrons pyare et al 2010 shanley et al 2013 prior to exceeding this fragmentation threshold however our simulation results indicate that landscape configuration may be a primary driver of functional landscape connectivity i e traversability our model results identified a suite of landscape and behavioral metrics beyond landscape composition that may improve our understanding of landscape connectivity careful consideration of the interaction of dispersal behavior with landscape composition and configuration using ibm tools can inform management decisions regarding future harvests specifically our results demonstrate that the movement of dispersing g s griseifrons is influenced by the number size or location of future timber sales which ultimately determines the functional connectivity of the landscape scheibe et al 2006 smith et al 2011b smith et al 2011b concluded that underlying assumptions of the tlmp old growth strategy were untenable because the number of dispersers necessary to mitigate effective distances among reserves 50 of the reserves were isolated exceeded the minimum number of dispersers that could be consistently produced by breeding populations of g s griseifrons in small old growth reserves our results illustrate how landscape composition and configuration explicitly influence the movement of individual g s griseifrons e g dispersal distance tortuosity therefore the detrimental effects of small reserve size and long inter reserve distances may potentially be exacerbated by poor landscape connectivity within the reserves themselves due to habitat configuration reduced landscape connectivity may lead to reductions in occupancy and therefore in the number of emigrants capable of traveling between reserves smith and person 2007 smith et al 2011b the traversability index demonstrated that an increase in area harvested might not necessarily reduce the structural landscape connectivity for g s griseifrons harvest locations in addition to total harvest area also influenced overall connectivity of the map as demonstrated by one of the 6 harvest scenarios producing lower traversability values than the 9 harvest scenarios this result is likely due to the spatial configuration of habitat types across alternative scenarios and our results present just 1 example where habitat configuration was more important than composition thus species management plans designed solely around minimizing loss of habitat i e spatially implicit or aspatial analysis might not be sufficient when designing conservation strategies for species of concern calabrese and fagan 2004 heller and zavaleta 2009 pascual hortal and saura 2006 smith 2013 smith et al 2011a the dispersal distance metric dd indicated that increased fragmentation reduced the movement capabilities of g s griseifrons the dd from natal location to final home range showed a strong positive relationship with the traversability index indicating that individuals established home ranges farther from their natal location as habitat connectivity increased this result supports previous research that shows decreased emigration rates of g s griseifrons with increased fragmentation pyare et al 2010 smith et al 2011b and greater homing success with greater connectivity smith et al 2011a whereas no area on the study landscape was structurally isolated i e habitat island small corridors created through increased harvest limited the movement of dispersers throughout the map creating functionally isolated populations on the landscape smith et al 2011b the restriction of long distance dispersal may lead to local extinctions fahrig and merriam 1994 gilpin and hanski 2012 or a decrease in genetic variability gilpin and gilpin 1991 keller and largiader 2003 trakhtenbrot et al 2005 of an already isolated subspecies bidlack and cook 2001 threatening the long term viability of the metapopulation thomas 2000 further indication of habitat fragmentation limiting the movement of g s griseifrons is evident through our measures of tortuosity and landscape usage the tortuosity values suggest that individuals traveled in more sinuous routes while searching for a home range in more connected landscapes this could be driven by a more contiguous landscape facilitating freer movement e g forays as individuals explored for potential settlement locations in contrast more fragmented landscapes limit the opportunities to search in all directions for a home range and instead funnel individuals in straighter paths through corridor like landscape features of preferred habitat shanley et al 2013 smith et al 2013 smc3 this is further supported by the greater kde values observed on more connected landscapes which in conjunction with the tortuosity metric suggests a greater area of the landscape used by g s griseifrons as connectivity increased our results did not identify a clear influence of landscape connectivity on time steps to establishment tse or the amount of time spent in each habitat type while tse did have a positive relationship with traversability there was also an interaction effect with resident population size as traversability increased dispersal was more successful and the resulting high resident population densities following years of successful dispersal rates may have resulted in longer search times to home range establishment constraints within our modeling framework limited the scope of our study to the relationships between animal behavior and landscape structure for example we simulated only a subset of total potential dispersers while assuming an underlying landscape that was near carrying capacity due to computational constraints we simulated alternative management scenarios for a single landscape such limitations represent a tradeoff of breadth of simulation areas for spatial and behavioral complexity and realism uncertainty around some behavioral parameters also limited model outputs to a relative rather than predictive capacity radchuk et al 2016 for example mean distances traveled over a 4 hr time step are difficult to extract from empirical data and sensitivity analysis indicated that mean step lengths are partly responsible for the variation in model outputs future work may focus on additional empirical investigation of fine scale movement patterns of g s griseifrons using radio telemetry evaluating connectivity and landscape resistance in fragmented landscapes using genetic analysis and adjusting our model to be

25122,plant phenology is one of the main controls of variation in net ecosystem productivity nep accurate representation of vegetation phenology is important for predicting ecosystem carbon budget although using satellite observation to determine vegetation phenology is becoming a mature option there are still uncertainties in its application at site scales our purpose is to establish a more robust phenological index to accurately predict carbon uptake phenology which detailed results can complement the shortcomings of modis ndvi derived phenology here we used a growing season index gsi phenology model to simulate carbon flux phenology cfp including the start of carbon uptake custart the end of carbon uptake cuend and the length of carbon uptake period cup in an alpine meadow ecosystem on the tibetan plateau and to compare the results with those modeled from modis ndvi we also further analyzed the main environmental factors in controlling cfp the results indicated that the gsi model made substantially more precise prediction for custart cuend and cup with higher correlation r2 0 90 than that of the modis derived phenology the gsi model was also superior to ndvi in predicting both seasonal and annual variations of net ecosystem productivity nep moreover cup played an important role in regulating ecosystem carbon balance in the study site because nep was significantly positive correlated with the period of annual carbon uptake nep would increase by 1 63 g c m 2 year 1 if one cup day was extended further cup was influenced by variation in custart previously overlooked water variability soil water content and vpd played a significant role in controlling cup and custart in addition temperature could enhance water stress to delay custart and shorten cup it is indicated that decrease in carbon uptake could be induced by accelerative water stress in the face of global warming in the alpine meadow these results suggest that cfp is more sensitive to not only temperature but also water condition and a combination of soil water and temperature could be a useful way to enhance the estimation of cfp in future ecosystem model keywords carbon flux phenology growing season index ndvi net ecosystem productivity alpine meadow tibetan plateau 1 introduction vegetation phenology is the timing and length of growing season of plant species and the relationships with biotic and abiotic forces lieth 1975 the phenology of vegetation can serve as an independent measure and powerful indicator of long term biological impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems due to its sensitivity to year to year climatic variability menzel and fabian 1999 peng et al 2017 richardson et al 2013 furthermore variation in phenology of vegetation may also influence ecosystem carbon cycle baldocchi and wilson 2001 piao et al 2008 richardson et al 2010 by regulating seasonal and annual variations of carbon fluxes and their relationships with climate change du et al 2017 richardson et al 2009 wang et al 2011 white and nemani 2003 previous studies showed that poor interpretation of phenology led to inaccurate estimates of plant productivity and carbon sequestration shi et al 2006b wu et al 2017 so far most of phenology studies have been conducted in forest ecosystems however knowledge from grasslands especially from alpine meadow ecosystem is limited therefore accurate prediction of variation in plant phenology of alpine meadows is imperative to better understand carbon exchange in the context of global change growing season transition describes the dates during distinct change in leaf color observed from remote sensing or ground measurements or the dates between bud break in spring and leaf senescence in autumn significant uncertainty exists in exploring phenology due to variations in thresholds arising from site specific factors which may not be robust for global applications zhao et al 2017 although it is a mature option to use remote sensing image for determining vegetation phenology there are still several impeding problems for example image resolution atmospheric interference in the satellite reflectance ndvi insensitivity and noise huete et al 2002 1994 make difficulties to extract the exact dates of the start of growing season sos and end of season eos from satellite time series gonsamo et al 2012a michaela et al 2009 schwartz and hanes 2010 and these observations cannot predict changes in phonological events and its influence on carbon fluxes in response to future climate change ma et al 2012 an alternative method is to detect the patterns of co2 flux phenology cfp with continuous measurements of co2 exchange from eddy covariance ec technique net co2 uptake phenology is estimated by the dates when daily net ecosystem exchange of co2 nee switches from positive to negative in spring and from negative to positive in autumn wu et al 2013 although the ec technique has been proven to be a good proxy in estimating cfp at site scale gonsamo et al 2013 it can only provide very limited co2 flux over footprints with restricted size and varied shape moreover it is difficult to capture the carbon flux phenology to a larger scale using limited sites and observations especially in high altitude areas such as on the tibetan plateau chai et al 2017a this limitation could constrain the application of c flux phenology therefore alternative models are needed to accurately predict and capture vegetation phenology at temporal and spatial scales the climatic signals are important controls on carbon cycle during net c uptake period generally corresponding to dates between the beginning and end of growing season in grassland ecosystems grant et al 2012 in high latitude and high altitude ecosystems two critical factors regulating the length of the growing season are the timing of snowmelt and snow cover thickness berdanier and klein 2011 dorji et al 2013 inouye et al 2003 however the timing of snow melt cannot always be used to indicate the start of plant growth in alpine meadow totland and alatalo 2002 as snow does not cover the landscape during the whole dormant season in some arid semiarid or monsoon dominated ecosystems likely in some areas on the tibetan plateau shen 2011 wang et al 2008 so the temperature of soil thaw and subsequent soil water availability are the main environmental cues to indicate the starting time of alpine plants many studies frequently focus on the role of temperature and recent climate warming trends in affecting phenology for alpine plants jin et al 2016 shen et al 2016 wohlfahrt et al 2013 because low temperature limit plant cell development and hence the formation of new plant tissue körner 2007 along with the somewhat related date of thaw however other factors can play a role including photoperiod keller and körner 2003 changes in water condition shen et al 2015 nitrogen deposition and interactions among these factors ganjurjav et al 2016b smith et al 2012 which may vary in different alpine ecosystems water availability is one of the critical environmental factors that regulate vegetation activities in many areas such as arid and semiarid grasslands ji and peters 2003 pennington and collins 2007 and can therefore affect plant phenology shen et al 2011 yu et al 2003 for example in alpine grasslands of the central himalaya soil water availability is essential for growth initiation of some species pangtey et al 1990 in addition changes in precipitation in arid and semiarid ecosystems may have more profound impact on phenology and c exchange than changes in temperature because spring precipitation could increase soil water content which may facilitate plant development and growth shen 2011 shen et al 2015 previous study showed that increase of 1 mm precipitation was associated with increase of 2 g c m 2 gross primary productivity gpp during april and may presumably owing to extended the growing season by enhanced soil moisture in the shallow rooting grass dominated grassland ma et al 2007 phonological change might not always be caused by the vegetation response to single climatic factor sometimes multiple factors control phenology concurrently or at different time of the year jolly et al 2005 however little is known about the interaction between climatic factors and its affect plant phenology in the alpine ecosystem on the tibetan plateau tibetan plateau with an area of 1 2 million km2 is largely covered by alpine meadows and alpine steppes which are extremely fragile and particularly sensitive to climate change piao et al 2011 zheng et al 2001 low temperature is likely to be a main factor limiting plant growth while water availability is greatly variable due to substantial regional precipitation variation and uneven seasonal distribution caused by difference in monsoon intensity as a consequence plant growth in spring may be delayed and constrained by slow increase of soil water till the summer when temperature and precipitation are more suitable for fast plant growth ganjurjav et al 2016a we hypothesize that temperature and moisture interact to co limit plant growth and phenology in the semiarid alpine grasslands on the tibetan plateau to test this hypothesis we modified the growing season index gsi model jolly et al 2005 based on temperature and soil moisture to predict inter annual variability of net ecosystem productivity nep and the main transitions of nee derived cfp in a semiarid alpine steppe meadow from 2004 to 2009 we have tested the accuracy of the gsi model in predicting the seasonal dynamic of gpp see chai et al 2017a in this study we use ndvi derived phenology as a reference to compare with growing season phenological index in order to test the accurancy of gsi modelling because of unavailable field observation of phenology the main objectives of this study are 1 to predict cfp including the start of carbon uptake period custar the end of carbon uptake period cuend and the carbon uptake period cup and the seasonal and annual variability of nep using the gsi model 2 to compare the results from the gsi model with those from modis derived phenology 3 to examine the key climatic factors in controlling cfp the results of our study can provide an evaluation of the performance of these data source for estimating cfp in the alpine grasslands 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site is located at damxung alpine meadow research station one of the chinaflux sites 91 05 e 30 51 n

evaporation is 1725 7 mm and average wetness coefficient is 0 28 shi et al 2006a the growing season usually starts in may and ends in september the vegetation type is an alpine steppe meadow with dominant species of kobresia pygeama stipa capillacea carex montis everestii accompanied by k capillofolis anaphalis xylorhiza potentilla bifurca linn shi et al 2006a the soil is classified as meadow soil and detailed information on soil properties can be found in zong et al 2014 2 2 eddy covariance ec measurements and gap filling co2 flux was measured consecutively with the ec technique in the alpine meadow ecosystem at damxung from summer in 2003 on the description data acquisition and gap filling measurements of ec system were introduced in chai et al 2017a b here we briefly describe the ec system and data processing as follows the ec system is installed at 2 2 m above the gorund which composed of open path infrared gas analyzers model li 7500 licor lincoln ne usa and three

hukseflux delft the netherlands all meteorological data were recorded as 30 min averages with a 10 hz data logger model cr23x campbell scientific logan usa the co2 flux data were discontinuous due to extreme weather power supply and equipment failure therefore gap filling of lost data is an important prerequisite to controlling data quality and ensuring data reliability the method of data preprocessing and gap filling include spike removal corrections etc the data in rainy and extremely cloudy days and data from nighttime with friction velocity u 0 15 m s 1 were screened from analysis as well as negative nighttime nee were also discarded missing and rejected data during the study years 2004 2009 were less than 5 of the total in each year the nighttime and non growing season missing

index gsi model originally developed by jolly et al 2005 combines a set of climatic variables into a daily metric to predict vegetation phenology the original gsi model considers three key environmental variables on plant growth and canopy development i e photoperiod temperature and moisture we chose minimum air temperature tmin and soil water content swc at 5 cm depth to indicate temperature and moisture conditions in our study site the reason why we chose these parameters is that low temperature and soil water availability are main controllers to limit alpine plants growth and photosynthesis chai et al 2017a the interaction between swc and tmin often defines the length of photosynthetic season as the days below the thresholds of those in which plants do not produce leave or photosynthesize chapin et al 2002 light is not included in the model because it is not a limiting factor of plant growth in the tibetan plateau churkina and running 1998 chai et al 2017a 2017b each variable was set a threshold value to indicate the relative canopy development assumed varying from inactive 0 to unconstrained 1 the minimum and maximum threshold of tmin tmmin and tmmax were set as 1 and 5 respectively by jolly et al 2005 but in present study tmmin was adjusted slightly from 2 to 1 due to grasses and herbs in alpine environment being subject to frost damage near ice point meanwhile we set the maximum and minimum swc threshold swcmin and swcmax as 0 05 m3 m 3 and 0 15 m3 m 3 respectively we found the thresholds of swc are liable to change in different ecosystems reviewing literatures fu et al 2006 hao et al 2008 according to their results we selected several thresholds ranging from 0 05 to 0 15 m3 m 3 to try the minimum and maximum multiplying the temperature and water stress indices itmin and iswc in this study forms a combined model to calculate daily growing season index igsi the igsi is continuous but normalized between 0 inactive and 1 unconstrained and then calculated as the 21 day moving averages of igsi for all years to avoid reaction to short term environmental changes and interference from abnormal data so as to guarantee the authenticity of seasonal dynamic variations in gsi and nep chai et al 2017a we chose the 21 day moving average based on not only literature but also the result of the test from 3 to 25 day moving average because of its flexibility it can be used to ecosystems of other areas we just need to change limited factors in order to meet the requirements of the ecosystems in other ecosystems of different climate zones key environmental factors can be selected such as radiation photoperiod vpd nutrient availability and so on if they are limiting factors in specific ecosystems a threshold value gsi 0 5 was chosen to trigger the start of the growing season in the spring and the end of the growing season in the fall jolly et al 2005 alternative threshold values can be selected we found however that anomalies in low or high threshold values were larger than that of 0 5 threshold values 2 3 2 remote sensing based phenology data sources modis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi dataset mod13q1 was derived from nasa terra satellites from 2004 to 2009 including ndvi data and quality control data with spatial resolution of 250 m the ndvi data were based on the maximum synthesis method in 16 days and were processed with the geometric correction and atmospheric correction we extracted pixels which values of quality control data were 0 or 1 in order to ensure data quality we used ratio threshold method rtm to extract phenological information yu et al 2010 and analyze changes in custart cuend and cup for natural steppe meadow in damxung station from 2004 to 2009 the ndvi derived phenological information was used as a reference to test the accuracy of the gsi modeled phenology in present study for the rtm the ndvi ratio is the difference between the ndvi value at a certain time and minimum ndvi value for a specific time span normalized by the total range of ndvi values during maximum ndvi value and minimum ndvi value in each year in this study we selected a ndvi ratio threshold of 0 2 to indicate the custart and a drop of the ndvi ratio below 0 6 to mark the cuend as determined by yu et al 2010 who used ground observations and modeled growing season parameters on the qinghai tibetan plateau based on the rtm method the phenological metrics were derived from ndvi time series by using timesat v 3 1 jönsson and eklundh 2004 a software package to best fit temporal dynamics of vegetation asymmetric gaussian smoothing filter was selected because it exhibited superior performance in the preservation of the vegetation temporal dynamics on qinghai tibetan plateau song et al 2011 2 3 3 determining carbon flux phenology from nee data the carbon flux phenology was retrieved based on the method developed by baldocchi et al 2005 and zhu et al 2013 the start of carbon uptake custart was identified as the days when daily nee experienced transitions from its winter or non growing season respiration phase to spring summer or growing season assimilation phase similarly the end of carbon uptake cuend was from its summer autumn or growing season assimilation phase to winter or non growing season respiration phase baldocchi et al 2005 we extracted carbon uptake phenology by using subset of nee data from these springtime source sink and autumn sink source transition periods to fit a linear regression equation between the daily nee and the day of year doy respectively specifically we followed three steps first the original daily nee data were smoothed with a 21 day running average width next based on the smoothed daily nee two continuous 10 day width windows were selected to predict custart and cuend one is the first 5 elements greater than 0 and the last 5 elements less than 0 was selected in spring summer period the other is the first 5 elements less than 0 and the last 5 elements greater than 0 finally the smoothed daily nee in the two selected windows was linearly correlated with doy and then the day of custart and cuend at the zero intersection were calculated zhu et al 2013 the time duration between the respective start and end days with negative nee is calculated as the cup in each year 2 4 standardizing nep net ecosystem productivity nep nee is the balance between carbon uptake through photosynthesis and carbon release through respiration and decomposition in order to guarantee the stability and uniformity of data nep was turned into scalar 4 n e p s c a l a r n e p n e p m i n n e p m a x n e p m i n where nepscalar is the standardized nep ranging from 0 to 1 nep is the daily nep nepmax the annual maximum daily nep and nepmin the annual minimum daily nep 2 5 statistical analyses regression coefficient of determination was calculated in order to evaluate the goodness of fit between observed and predicted custart cuend as well as cup accuracy of regression model was validated by root mean square error rmse and bias was calculated as eq 6 5 r m s e o i m i 2 n 6 b i a s o i m i n where oi and mi represent the observed and simulated carbon flux phenology respectively and n indicates the total number of estimates at the study site higher r 2 lower rmse and bias indicate better model performance the grey correlation analysis was used to weight correlative degree of similarity or difference according to the developing of the elements deng 2002 if two series have similar curves and close distance the correlation is strong and vice versa hui and bifeng 2009 ling and qi 2011 grey relational degree model has lower demand on the number and distribution of the samples than regression analysis and it is often used to quantitative comparison analysis of development and changing system so it is suitable for comparing development and changing seasonal trend between observed nep gsi and ndvi partial least square pls regression analysis was conducted to investigate the major drivers of the inter annual variation of cfp typical outputs from the pls regression analysis are the variable importance in the projection vip statistic and model coefficients for each independent variable higher vip scores exceeding 1 0 can be considered as the most informative drivers for the dependent variables ishtiaq and abdul aziz 2015 kuhn 2013 in this analysis we only showed model coefficients for important variables with vip 1 0 the regression coefficients of the optimal pls can represent the direction and strength of the effect of a given independent variable on the dependent variable yu et al 2012 the pls analysis was carried out using simca software v 11 5 umetrics umeå sweden because ndvi data are the 16 day average values we use corresponding 16 day averages of nepscalar and gsi for grey correlation analysis and seasonal dynamic comparison in order to keep time in phase 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations in ndvi gsi and nepscalar two important facts were shown from the seasonal dynamics of nepscalar ndvi and gsi during the period studied from 2004 to 2009 first although ndvi tends to follow the time dynamics of nepscalar the start and the end of measurable cup cannot be truly captured second compared to ndvi gsi followed the time dynamics of nepscalar more closely and thus tracked vegetation cup accurately fig 1 we proved this observation through grey correlation analysis grey correlation coefficients between nepscalar and gsi were higher than those between nepscalar and ndvi from 2004 to 2009 fig 1 and the 6 year mean grey correlation coefficients between nepscalar and gsi and between nepscalar and ndvi were 0 65 and 0 55 respectively additionally annual nep was correlated well with gsi rather than with ndvi with gsi explaining 13 more than ndvi for the variation of annual nep fig 2 it implied that the gsi model were able to better predict the seasonal and annual variation of nep than those of ndvi 3 2 comparison of simulated cfp from the ndvi and the gsi model we compared the custart cuend and cup derived from observation and simulation using the ndvi and the gsi models fig 3 a large annual variation presented in the observed custart from 2004 to 2009 the measured custart ranged from 153 to 211 doy and mean doy was 174 26 with a small difference less than 20 days except for 2007 and 2009 the observed custart was about 27 and 38 days later than the average custart in the dry year of 2007 and 2009 respectively there was a shorter mean interval less than 6 days between the observed custart and predicted custart with gsi compared with that of ndvi the custart predicted with ndvi usually occurred earlier than observed results with an average interval of 9 days there was a small annual variation in the observed cuend during 2004 and 2009 the observed cuend ranged from 270 to 290 with an average of 279 7 in the doy the predicted cuend with ndvi was usually latter than the observed cuend except for the year of 2005 and 2008 gsi had a better performance for the prediction of cuend compared with that of ndvi the annual observed cup ranged from 61 to 138 days with an average of 101 29 days a large annual variation spanned from the drier year in 2009 and the wettest year in 2008 the shortest cup occurred in 2009 for both the observation and the simulation from gsi with values of 61 and 48 days the longest cup occurred in 2008 for both the observed and simulated values from gsi with values of 138 and 128 days the average cups predicted with gsi and ndvi were 95 28 and 113 24 days the predicted cup from ndvi was much longer than the observed one mainly caused by the early prediction of custart and the late prediction of cuend one of our objectives was to compare custart cuend and cup from remote sensing data and the gsi model fig 3 the overall results indicated that custart cuend and cup from gsi were more close to the observed data by ec with reduced rmse and bias and higher correlation than those of ndvi the simulated cup by gsi almost overlapped with the observation but the simulated values by ndvi had much larger difference as compared with the observation fig 3c 3 3 the dependence of annual co2 fluxes on cup fig 4 showed the relationships between annual co2 fluxes and cup annual nep was significantly correlated with the observed cup marginally correlative with the gsi simulated cup but not related to the ndvi derived cup fig 4a longer cup helped enhance annual carbon accumulation with increase of 1 63 g c m 2 if one day longer of the cup annual gpp and cup simulated by the gsi model and observed by nee showed positive but non significant correlations while there was no trend in simulated results from ndvi fig 4b all cup had no significant effect on annual ecosystem respiration re fig 4c the annual re gpp ratios was marginally and negatively correlated with observed and predicted cup from gsi fig 4d 3 4 factors controlling cup cup showed a strong dependence on custart fig 5 based on the vip and standardized model coefficients of pls regression we found that environmental factors showed different importance in affecting the observed cup and custart fig 6 the vip values of mean annual soil water content maswc and mean annual vapor pressure deficit mavpd exceeded 1 0 the threshold for variable importance indicating that both are the most important factors to control the observed cup with model coefficients of 0 190 and 0 193 respectively fig 6a c meanwhile for maswc mavpd mean annual air temperature mata and mean annual 5 cm soil temperature mats the vip values exceeded 1 0 and model coefficients are 0 16 0 17 0 15 and 0 15 respectively significantly affected variation of the custart fig 6b d both the cup and the custart were limited by water condition 4 discussions 4 1 the performance of the gsi model substantial efforts have been devoted to improving the accuracy of many widely used land surface models including phenology model however previous studies demonstrated that phenology was one field which the existing model had poor performance in predicting plant phenology chen et al 2016 there is broad consensus that future climate change could alter vegetation development and phenology processes in alpine ecosystems kato et al 2006 shen et al 2016 while changed phenology can in return feedback to carbon and water fluxes through the controlling of leaf area index piao et al 2011 therefore accurately predicting plant phenology requires better phenology models in this study we evaluated the feasibility of a gsi model by coupling environmental factors i e daily tmin and swc into a daily metric for the development and refinement models of cfp custart cuend and cup and nep models in an alpine steppe meadow and compared to the performance of satellite remote sensing data as a reference our results showed that the gsi model made considerably more accurate predictions of custart cuend and cup than the modis ndvi derived phenology the gsi model had lower rmse bias and higher linear correlation coefficient than those of the ndvi model additionally the gsi model reflected better predicted nep than ndvi in the target alpine steppe meadow we proved that the gsi model could effectively predict carbon flux phenology gross primary production and carbon budget in studied ecosystem on the tibetan plateau meteorological factors are important candidate explanatory variables in estimating carbon flux phenology dates wu et al 2013 zhu et al 2013 combining optimal climate drivers within phenological models can obviously improve the estimation robustness as the models are applied in a wide spatial and temporal range gonsamo et al 2012b richardson et al 2012 so the key question is how to select the optimal explanatory climate drivers solar radiation is intense in alpine steppe meadow on the tibetan plateau while annual precipitation and annual mean temperature are relatively low the low temperature and frequent drought could be the most severe stress on plant growth especially in semi arid or arid alpine ecosystems kato et al 2006 luan et al 2016 pullens et al 2016 wertin et al 2015 we combined minimum temperature and soil moisture which are the most important factors to control vegetation growth in the alpine ecosystems on the tibetan plateau chapin et al 2002 into the gsi model to predict seasonal and annual dynamics of nep and carbon flux phenology meanwhile a threshold gsi value was defined based on the study of jolly et al 2005 as plant canopy can or cannot develop above or below the value this cutoff value represents at least half of the days were sufficient to maintain vegetation carbon uptake from atmosphere the gsi model is so flexible that different environmental factors that control phenology regionally such as light temperature and moisture as well as threshold value can be included for example in forest grassland or crop ecosystems daily temperature vpd and photoperiod can be combined into the gsi model jolly et al 2005 ma et al 2012 xin et al 2015 large discrepancies exist in estimation of plant phenology using the ndvi and the gsi model for example the time of leaf onset or senescence does not always match custart or cuend for years under different precipitation in the alpine meadow ecosystem because carbon flux phenology captured by custart dates based on plant leaves is large enough to ensure that photosynthetic rate is higher than respiration and the time of custart general later than that of leaf onset similarly the cuend dates based on ecosystem respiration becomes larger than photosynthesis but plant growth may continue and senescence and dormancy processes should be later than cuend zhu et al 2013 in addition alpine ecosystem may become a net carbon source for a few days due to drought events chai et al 2017b which does not imply the end of growing season as a result ndvi cannot accurately estimate carbon flux phenology at a site scale instead a site based water and thermal integrated gsi index can do it because of high frequence of real time data avaibility from flux stations so gsi provides more detailed informations which just complement the shortcomings of the ndvi approach be used at single site we show that the gsi model can be well applied at site scale however there is a shortage for the gsi model to be applied at the broader scales because environmental data such as ta swc vpd are available in sites but difficult to gain at large scales so gsi has its disavanatage to be applied and scale up at broader scales compared with modis ndvi method but if given more hygrothermal data provided by increasing the number of flux tower sites accurate carbon flux phenology will be expected to be simulated by the gsi model at larger scales 4 2 carbon sequestration mediated by cup the driving of cup on carbon sequestration has been studied in many grassland and forest ecosystems evidence showed that the carbon exchange in land atmosphere system is sensitive to phenology barr et al 2004 grant et al 2012 kang et al 2016 white and nemani 2003 our resluts also suggested that inter annual variations in co2 fluxes were controlled by annual cup annual nep would increase by 1 63 g c m 2 year 1 if one cup day were extended the increased amplitudes in alpine meadow differed from those in other ecosystems richardson et al 2013 in general the increased nep values in forests were higher than that in grasslands for example the nep increased by 5 7 and 5 8 g c m 2 year 1 per extended cup day in a temperate broadleaf and a deciduous broadleaf forest respectively baldocchi and wilson 2001 churkina et al 2005 and the nep increased by 2 0 and 4 0 gc m 2 year 1 per extended growing season day for a savanna and an open grassland respectively ma et al 2007 the increase of carbon sequestration per extended cup day in the alpine steppe meadow by contrast is much lower than those of abovementioned grassland ecosystems bao et al 2014 perhaps due to low productivity limited by low temperature and frequent fluctuation of water availability 4 3 effects of water condition on cup temperature is the key determinant in vegetation phenology development cleland et al 2006 piao et al 2008 2011 meanwhile other environmental factors may also modulate vegetation phenology water availability is an important limiting factor to plant growth in the arid semiarid areas and the variability in phenology could be closely related to soil water conditions shen et al 2015 pls regression model analysis showed significant relationship of cup with maswc and mavpd fig 5b and it can be interpreted by the relationships between cup and custart and between custart and maswc mavpd the custart strongly controlled the length of cup and earlier custart could lengthen cup in the alpine meadow fig 5 this important date would be affected strongly by maswc mavpd and it could be aggravated by higher temperature mata or mats fig 6 because increasing temperature can cause water stress in shallow soil layers by enhancing evapotranspiration and therefore suppresses the growth and development of shallow rooted plants shen et al 2015 yu et al 2003 this can explain the unexpected positive relationship between temperature and custart in our study site in other words a better water condition would result in an earlier beginning of the cup and the prolonged duration of the cup could lead to increase of the annual carbon sequestration this result confirms that opinion that water availability often but not always constrained the initiation of spring custart when soil moisture is low even though temperature is sufficiently high ganjurjav et al 2016b ganjurjav et al 2016b and dorji et al 2013 observed similar results and suggested that water availability limited spring phenology on the qinghai tibetan plateau moreover shen et al 2015 also found that spring greening was more sensitive to inter annual variations in preseason precipitation in arid areas than in wetter areas in addition a study showed that plant production increased and phenology occurred earlier in wet years than in dry years in grassland ecosystem of californian swarbreck et al 2015 5 conclusions growing season index gsi model and modis phenology model were used to predict carbon flux phenology including custart cuend and cup based on 6 year continuous flux measurements at an alpine steppe meadow on the tibetan plateau results showed that the gsi model performed better than ndvi derived phenology to accurately predict the custart cuend and cup at the single site especially in wet year and drought year its detailed results can complement the shortcomings of the ndvi approach be used at single site additionally significant positive relationship was found between annual cup and nep and nep would increase by 1 63 gcm 2 year 1 if one cup day was extended the length of cup was determined by water condition swc and vpd which mainly affected the custart due to significant correlation of custart with the cup meanwhile higher temperature mata and mats can lead to delay in custart and further lead to decline in cup especially in dry year it suggests that global warming does not always promote plant growth and vegetation phenology in the semiarid alpine steppe meadow because it also can accelerate drought and shorten cup and thus decrease carbon sequestration acknowledgements this work was funded by the national natural science foundation of china nos

25122,plant phenology is one of the main controls of variation in net ecosystem productivity nep accurate representation of vegetation phenology is important for predicting ecosystem carbon budget although using satellite observation to determine vegetation phenology is becoming a mature option there are still uncertainties in its application at site scales our purpose is to establish a more robust phenological index to accurately predict carbon uptake phenology which detailed results can complement the shortcomings of modis ndvi derived phenology here we used a growing season index gsi phenology model to simulate carbon flux phenology cfp including the start of carbon uptake custart the end of carbon uptake cuend and the length of carbon uptake period cup in an alpine meadow ecosystem on the tibetan plateau and to compare the results with those modeled from modis ndvi we also further analyzed the main environmental factors in controlling cfp the results indicated that the gsi model made substantially more precise prediction for custart cuend and cup with higher correlation r2 0 90 than that of the modis derived phenology the gsi model was also superior to ndvi in predicting both seasonal and annual variations of net ecosystem productivity nep moreover cup played an important role in regulating ecosystem carbon balance in the study site because nep was significantly positive correlated with the period of annual carbon uptake nep would increase by 1 63 g c m 2 year 1 if one cup day was extended further cup was influenced by variation in custart previously overlooked water variability soil water content and vpd played a significant role in controlling cup and custart in addition temperature could enhance water stress to delay custart and shorten cup it is indicated that decrease in carbon uptake could be induced by accelerative water stress in the face of global warming in the alpine meadow these results suggest that cfp is more sensitive to not only temperature but also water condition and a combination of soil water and temperature could be a useful way to enhance the estimation of cfp in future ecosystem model keywords carbon flux phenology growing season index ndvi net ecosystem productivity alpine meadow tibetan plateau 1 introduction vegetation phenology is the timing and length of growing season of plant species and the relationships with biotic and abiotic forces lieth 1975 the phenology of vegetation can serve as an independent measure and powerful indicator of long term biological impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems due to its sensitivity to year to year climatic variability menzel and fabian 1999 peng et al 2017 richardson et al 2013 furthermore variation in phenology of vegetation may also influence ecosystem carbon cycle baldocchi and wilson 2001 piao et al 2008 richardson et al 2010 by regulating seasonal and annual variations of carbon fluxes and their relationships with climate change du et al 2017 richardson et al 2009 wang et al 2011 white and nemani 2003 previous studies showed that poor interpretation of phenology led to inaccurate estimates of plant productivity and carbon sequestration shi et al 2006b wu et al 2017 so far most of phenology studies have been conducted in forest ecosystems however knowledge from grasslands especially from alpine meadow ecosystem is limited therefore accurate prediction of variation in plant phenology of alpine meadows is imperative to better understand carbon exchange in the context of global change growing season transition describes the dates during distinct change in leaf color observed from remote sensing or ground measurements or the dates between bud break in spring and leaf senescence in autumn significant uncertainty exists in exploring phenology due to variations in thresholds arising from site specific factors which may not be robust for global applications zhao et al 2017 although it is a mature option to use remote sensing image for determining vegetation phenology there are still several impeding problems for example image resolution atmospheric interference in the satellite reflectance ndvi insensitivity and noise huete et al 2002 1994 make difficulties to extract the exact dates of the start of growing season sos and end of season eos from satellite time series gonsamo et al 2012a michaela et al 2009 schwartz and hanes 2010 and these observations cannot predict changes in phonological events and its influence on carbon fluxes in response to future climate change ma et al 2012 an alternative method is to detect the patterns of co2 flux phenology cfp with continuous measurements of co2 exchange from eddy covariance ec technique net co2 uptake phenology is estimated by the dates when daily net ecosystem exchange of co2 nee switches from positive to negative in spring and from negative to positive in autumn wu et al 2013 although the ec technique has been proven to be a good proxy in estimating cfp at site scale gonsamo et al 2013 it can only provide very limited co2 flux over footprints with restricted size and varied shape moreover it is difficult to capture the carbon flux phenology to a larger scale using limited sites and observations especially in high altitude areas such as on the tibetan plateau chai et al 2017a this limitation could constrain the application of c flux phenology therefore alternative models are needed to accurately predict and capture vegetation phenology at temporal and spatial scales the climatic signals are important controls on carbon cycle during net c uptake period generally corresponding to dates between the beginning and end of growing season in grassland ecosystems grant et al 2012 in high latitude and high altitude ecosystems two critical factors regulating the length of the growing season are the timing of snowmelt and snow cover thickness berdanier and klein 2011 dorji et al 2013 inouye et al 2003 however the timing of snow melt cannot always be used to indicate the start of plant growth in alpine meadow totland and alatalo 2002 as snow does not cover the landscape during the whole dormant season in some arid semiarid or monsoon dominated ecosystems likely in some areas on the tibetan plateau shen 2011 wang et al 2008 so the temperature of soil thaw and subsequent soil water availability are the main environmental cues to indicate the starting time of alpine plants many studies frequently focus on the role of temperature and recent climate warming trends in affecting phenology for alpine plants jin et al 2016 shen et al 2016 wohlfahrt et al 2013 because low temperature limit plant cell development and hence the formation of new plant tissue körner 2007 along with the somewhat related date of thaw however other factors can play a role including photoperiod keller and körner 2003 changes in water condition shen et al 2015 nitrogen deposition and interactions among these factors ganjurjav et al 2016b smith et al 2012 which may vary in different alpine ecosystems water availability is one of the critical environmental factors that regulate vegetation activities in many areas such as arid and semiarid grasslands ji and peters 2003 pennington and collins 2007 and can therefore affect plant phenology shen et al 2011 yu et al 2003 for example in alpine grasslands of the central himalaya soil water availability is essential for growth initiation of some species pangtey et al 1990 in addition changes in precipitation in arid and semiarid ecosystems may have more profound impact on phenology and c exchange than changes in temperature because spring precipitation could increase soil water content which may facilitate plant development and growth shen 2011 shen et al 2015 previous study showed that increase of 1 mm precipitation was associated with increase of 2 g c m 2 gross primary productivity gpp during april and may presumably owing to extended the growing season by enhanced soil moisture in the shallow rooting grass dominated grassland ma et al 2007 phonological change might not always be caused by the vegetation response to single climatic factor sometimes multiple factors control phenology concurrently or at different time of the year jolly et al 2005 however little is known about the interaction between climatic factors and its affect plant phenology in the alpine ecosystem on the tibetan plateau tibetan plateau with an area of 1 2 million km2 is largely covered by alpine meadows and alpine steppes which are extremely fragile and particularly sensitive to climate change piao et al 2011 zheng et al 2001 low temperature is likely to be a main factor limiting plant growth while water availability is greatly variable due to substantial regional precipitation variation and uneven seasonal distribution caused by difference in monsoon intensity as a consequence plant growth in spring may be delayed and constrained by slow increase of soil water till the summer when temperature and precipitation are more suitable for fast plant growth ganjurjav et al 2016a we hypothesize that temperature and moisture interact to co limit plant growth and phenology in the semiarid alpine grasslands on the tibetan plateau to test this hypothesis we modified the growing season index gsi model jolly et al 2005 based on temperature and soil moisture to predict inter annual variability of net ecosystem productivity nep and the main transitions of nee derived cfp in a semiarid alpine steppe meadow from 2004 to 2009 we have tested the accuracy of the gsi model in predicting the seasonal dynamic of gpp see chai et al 2017a in this study we use ndvi derived phenology as a reference to compare with growing season phenological index in order to test the accurancy of gsi modelling because of unavailable field observation of phenology the main objectives of this study are 1 to predict cfp including the start of carbon uptake period custar the end of carbon uptake period cuend and the carbon uptake period cup and the seasonal and annual variability of nep using the gsi model 2 to compare the results from the gsi model with those from modis derived phenology 3 to examine the key climatic factors in controlling cfp the results of our study can provide an evaluation of the performance of these data source for estimating cfp in the alpine grasslands 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site is located at damxung alpine meadow research station one of the chinaflux sites 91 05 e 30 51 n

soil and detailed information on soil properties can be found in zong et al 2014 2 2 eddy covariance ec measurements and gap filling co2 flux was measured consecutively with the ec technique in the alpine meadow ecosystem at damxung from summer in 2003 on the description data acquisition and gap filling measurements of ec system were introduced in chai et al 2017a b here we briefly describe the ec system and data processing as follows the ec system is installed at 2 2 m above the gorund which composed of open path infrared gas analyzers model li 7500 licor lincoln ne usa and three

hukseflux delft the netherlands all meteorological data were recorded as 30 min averages with a 10 hz data logger model cr23x campbell scientific logan usa the co2 flux data were discontinuous due to extreme weather power supply and equipment failure therefore gap filling of lost data is an important prerequisite to controlling data quality and ensuring data reliability the method of data preprocessing and gap filling include spike removal corrections etc the data in rainy and extremely cloudy days and data from nighttime with friction velocity u 0 15 m s 1 were screened from analysis as well as negative nighttime nee were also discarded missing and rejected data during the study years 2004 2009 were less than 5 of the total in each year the nighttime and non growing season missing

index gsi model originally developed by jolly et al 2005 combines a set of climatic variables into a daily metric to predict vegetation phenology the original gsi model considers three key environmental variables on plant growth and canopy development i e photoperiod temperature and moisture we chose minimum air temperature tmin and soil water content swc at 5 cm depth to indicate temperature and moisture conditions in our study site the reason why we chose these parameters is that low temperature and soil water availability are main controllers to limit alpine plants growth and photosynthesis chai et al 2017a the interaction between swc and tmin often defines the length of photosynthetic season as the days below the thresholds of those in which plants do not produce leave or photosynthesize chapin et al 2002 light is not included in the model because it is not a limiting factor of plant growth in the tibetan plateau churkina and running 1998 chai et al 2017a 2017b each variable was set a threshold value to indicate the relative canopy development assumed varying from inactive 0 to unconstrained 1 the minimum and maximum threshold of tmin tmmin and tmmax were set as 1 and 5 respectively by jolly et al 2005 but in present study tmmin was adjusted slightly from 2 to 1 due to grasses and herbs in alpine environment being subject to frost damage near ice point meanwhile we set the maximum and minimum swc threshold swcmin and swcmax as 0 05 m3 m 3 and 0 15 m3 m 3 respectively we found the thresholds of swc are liable to change in different ecosystems reviewing literatures fu et al 2006 hao et al 2008 according to their results we selected several thresholds ranging from 0 05 to 0 15 m3 m 3 to try the minimum and maximum multiplying the temperature and water stress indices itmin and iswc in this study forms a combined model to calculate daily growing season index igsi the igsi is continuous but normalized between 0 inactive and 1 unconstrained and then calculated as the 21 day moving averages of igsi for all years to avoid reaction to short term environmental changes and interference from abnormal data so as to guarantee the authenticity of seasonal dynamic variations in gsi and nep chai et al 2017a we chose the 21 day moving average based on not only literature but also the result of the test from 3 to 25 day moving average because of its flexibility it can be used to ecosystems of other areas we just need to change limited factors in order to meet the requirements of the ecosystems in other ecosystems of different climate zones key environmental factors can be selected such as radiation photoperiod vpd nutrient availability and so on if they are limiting factors in specific ecosystems a threshold value gsi 0 5 was chosen to trigger the start of the growing season in the spring and the end of the growing season in the fall jolly et al 2005 alternative threshold values can be selected we found however that anomalies in low or high threshold values were larger than that of 0 5 threshold values 2 3 2 remote sensing based phenology data sources modis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi dataset mod13q1 was derived from nasa terra satellites from 2004 to 2009 including ndvi data and quality control data with spatial resolution of 250 m the ndvi data were based on the maximum synthesis method in 16 days and were processed with the geometric correction and atmospheric correction we extracted pixels which values of quality control data were 0 or 1 in order to ensure data quality we used ratio threshold method rtm to extract phenological information yu et al 2010 and analyze changes in custart cuend and cup for natural steppe meadow in damxung station from 2004 to 2009 the ndvi derived phenological information was used as a reference to test the accuracy of the gsi modeled phenology in present study for the rtm the ndvi ratio is the difference between the ndvi value at a certain time and minimum ndvi value for a specific time span normalized by the total range of ndvi values during maximum ndvi value and minimum ndvi value in each year in this study we selected a ndvi ratio threshold of 0 2 to indicate the custart and a drop of the ndvi ratio below 0 6 to mark the cuend as determined by yu et al 2010 who used ground observations and modeled growing season parameters on the qinghai tibetan plateau based on the rtm method the phenological metrics were derived from ndvi time series by using timesat v 3 1 jönsson and eklundh 2004 a software package to best fit temporal dynamics of vegetation asymmetric gaussian smoothing filter was selected because it exhibited superior performance in the preservation of the vegetation temporal dynamics on qinghai tibetan plateau song et al 2011 2 3 3 determining carbon flux phenology from nee data the carbon flux phenology was retrieved based on the method developed by baldocchi et al 2005 and zhu et al 2013 the start of carbon uptake custart was identified as the days when daily nee experienced transitions from its winter or non growing season respiration phase to spring summer or growing season assimilation phase similarly the end of carbon uptake cuend was from its summer autumn or growing season assimilation phase to winter or non growing season respiration phase baldocchi et al 2005 we extracted carbon uptake phenology by using subset of nee data from these springtime source sink and autumn sink source transition periods to fit a linear regression equation between the daily nee and the day of year doy respectively specifically we followed three steps first the original daily nee data were smoothed with a 21 day running average width next based on the smoothed daily nee two continuous 10 day width windows were selected to predict custart and cuend one is the first 5 elements greater than 0 and the last 5 elements less than 0 was selected in spring summer period the other is the first 5 elements less than 0 and the last 5 elements greater than 0 finally the smoothed daily nee in the two selected windows was linearly correlated with doy and then the day of custart and cuend at the zero intersection were calculated zhu et al 2013 the time duration between the respective start and end days with negative nee is calculated as the cup in each year 2 4 standardizing nep net ecosystem productivity nep nee is the balance between carbon uptake through photosynthesis and carbon release through respiration and decomposition in order to guarantee the stability and uniformity of data nep was turned into scalar 4 n e p s c a l a r n e p n e p m i n n e p m a x n e p m i n where nepscalar is the standardized nep ranging from 0 to 1 nep is the daily nep nepmax the annual maximum daily nep and nepmin the annual minimum daily nep 2 5 statistical analyses regression coefficient of determination was calculated in order to evaluate the goodness of fit between observed and predicted custart cuend as well as cup accuracy of regression model was validated by root mean square error rmse and bias was calculated as eq 6 5 r m s e o i m i 2 n 6 b i a s o i m i n where oi and mi represent the observed and simulated carbon flux phenology respectively and n indicates the total number of estimates at the study site higher r 2 lower rmse and bias indicate better model performance the grey correlation analysis was used to weight correlative degree of similarity or difference according to the developing of the elements deng 2002 if two series have similar curves and close distance the correlation is strong and vice versa hui and bifeng 2009 ling and qi 2011 grey relational degree model has lower demand on the number and distribution of the samples than regression analysis and it is often used to quantitative comparison analysis of development and changing system so it is suitable for comparing development and changing seasonal trend between observed nep gsi and ndvi partial least square pls regression analysis was conducted to investigate the major drivers of the inter annual variation of cfp typical outputs from the pls regression analysis are the variable importance in the projection vip statistic and model coefficients for each independent variable higher vip scores exceeding 1 0 can be considered as the most informative drivers for the dependent variables ishtiaq and abdul aziz 2015 kuhn 2013 in this analysis we only showed model coefficients for important variables with vip 1 0 the regression coefficients of the optimal pls can represent the direction and strength of the effect of a given independent variable on the dependent variable yu et al 2012 the pls analysis was carried out using simca software v 11 5 umetrics umeå sweden because ndvi data are the 16 day average values we use corresponding 16 day averages of nepscalar and gsi for grey correlation analysis and seasonal dynamic comparison in order to keep time in phase 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations in ndvi gsi and nepscalar two important facts were shown from the seasonal dynamics of nepscalar ndvi and gsi during the period studied from 2004 to 2009 first although ndvi tends to follow the time dynamics of nepscalar the start and the end of measurable cup cannot be truly captured second compared to ndvi gsi followed the time dynamics of nepscalar more closely and thus tracked vegetation cup accurately fig 1 we proved this observation through grey correlation analysis grey correlation coefficients between nepscalar and gsi were higher than those between nepscalar and ndvi from 2004 to 2009 fig 1 and the 6 year mean grey correlation coefficients between nepscalar and gsi and between nepscalar and ndvi were 0 65 and 0 55 respectively additionally annual nep was correlated well with gsi rather than with ndvi with gsi explaining 13 more than ndvi for the variation of annual nep fig 2 it implied that the gsi model were able to better predict the seasonal and annual variation of nep than those of ndvi 3 2 comparison of simulated cfp from the ndvi and the gsi model we compared the custart cuend and cup derived from observation and simulation using the ndvi and the gsi models fig 3 a large annual variation presented in the observed custart from 2004 to 2009 the measured custart ranged from 153 to 211 doy and mean doy was 174 26 with a small difference less than 20 days except for 2007 and 2009 the observed custart was about 27 and 38 days later than the average custart in the dry year of 2007 and 2009 respectively there was a shorter mean interval less than 6 days between the observed custart and predicted custart with gsi compared with that of ndvi the custart predicted with ndvi usually occurred earlier than observed results with an average interval of 9 days there was a small annual variation in the observed cuend during 2004 and 2009 the observed cuend ranged from 270 to 290 with an average of 279 7 in the doy the predicted cuend with ndvi was usually latter than the observed cuend except for the year of 2005 and 2008 gsi had a better performance for the prediction of cuend compared with that of ndvi the annual observed cup ranged from 61 to 138 days with an average of 101 29 days a large annual variation spanned from the drier year in 2009 and the wettest year in 2008 the shortest cup occurred in 2009 for both the observation and the simulation from gsi with values of 61 and 48 days the longest cup occurred in 2008 for both the observed and simulated values from gsi with values of 138 and 128 days the average cups predicted with gsi and ndvi were 95 28 and 113 24 days the predicted cup from ndvi was much longer than the observed one mainly caused by the early prediction of custart and the late prediction of cuend one of our objectives was to compare custart cuend and cup from remote sensing data and the gsi model fig 3 the overall results indicated that custart cuend and cup from gsi were more close to the observed data by ec with reduced rmse and bias and higher correlation than those of ndvi the simulated cup by gsi almost overlapped with the observation but the simulated values by ndvi had much larger difference as compared with the observation fig 3c 3 3 the dependence of annual co2 fluxes on cup fig 4 showed the relationships between annual co2 fluxes and cup annual nep was significantly correlated with the observed cup marginally correlative with the gsi simulated cup but not related to the ndvi derived cup fig 4a longer cup helped enhance annual carbon accumulation with increase of 1 63 g c m 2 if one day longer of the cup annual gpp and cup simulated by the gsi model and observed by nee showed positive but non significant correlations while there was no trend in simulated results from ndvi fig 4b all cup had no significant effect on annual ecosystem respiration re fig 4c the annual re gpp ratios was marginally and negatively correlated with observed and predicted cup from gsi fig 4d 3 4 factors controlling cup cup showed a strong dependence on custart fig 5 based on the vip and standardized model coefficients of pls regression we found that environmental factors showed different importance in affecting the observed cup and custart fig 6 the vip values of mean annual soil water content maswc and mean annual vapor pressure deficit mavpd exceeded 1 0 the threshold for variable importance indicating that both are the most important factors to control the observed cup with model coefficients of 0 190 and 0 193 respectively fig 6a c meanwhile for maswc mavpd mean annual air temperature mata and mean annual 5 cm soil temperature mats the vip values exceeded 1 0 and model coefficients are 0 16 0 17 0 15 and 0 15 respectively significantly affected variation of the custart fig 6b d both the cup and the custart were limited by water condition 4 discussions 4 1 the performance of the gsi model substantial efforts have been devoted to improving the accuracy of many widely used land surface models including phenology model however previous studies demonstrated that phenology was one field which the existing model had poor performance in predicting plant phenology chen et al 2016 there is broad consensus that future climate change could alter vegetation development and phenology processes in alpine ecosystems kato et al 2006 shen et al 2016 while changed phenology can in return feedback to carbon and water fluxes through the controlling of leaf area index piao et al 2011 therefore accurately predicting plant phenology requires better phenology models in this study we evaluated the feasibility of a gsi model by coupling environmental factors i e daily tmin and swc into a daily metric for the development and refinement models of cfp custart cuend and cup and nep models in an alpine steppe meadow and compared to the performance of satellite remote sensing data as a reference our results showed that the gsi model made considerably more accurate predictions of custart cuend and cup than the modis ndvi derived phenology the gsi model had lower rmse bias and higher linear correlation coefficient than those of the ndvi model additionally the gsi model reflected better predicted nep than ndvi in the target alpine steppe meadow we proved that the gsi model could effectively predict carbon flux phenology gross primary production and carbon budget in studied ecosystem on the tibetan plateau meteorological factors are important candidate explanatory variables in estimating carbon flux phenology dates wu et al 2013 zhu et al 2013 combining optimal climate drivers within phenological models can obviously improve the estimation robustness as the models are applied in a wide spatial and temporal range gonsamo et al 2012b richardson et al 2012 so the key question is how to select the optimal explanatory climate drivers solar radiation is intense in alpine steppe meadow on the tibetan plateau while annual precipitation and annual mean temperature are relatively low the low temperature and frequent drought could be the most severe stress on plant growth especially in semi arid or arid alpine ecosystems kato et al 2006 luan et al 2016 pullens et al 2016 wertin et al 2015 we combined minimum temperature and soil moisture which are the most important factors to control vegetation growth in the alpine ecosystems on the tibetan plateau chapin et al 2002 into the gsi model to predict seasonal and annual dynamics of nep and carbon flux phenology meanwhile a threshold gsi value was defined based on the study of jolly et al 2005 as plant canopy can or cannot develop above or below the value this cutoff value represents at least half of the days were sufficient to maintain vegetation carbon uptake from atmosphere the gsi model is so flexible that different environmental factors that control phenology regionally such as light temperature and moisture as well as threshold value can be included for example in forest grassland or crop ecosystems daily temperature vpd and photoperiod can be combined into the gsi model jolly et al 2005 ma et al 2012 xin et al 2015 large discrepancies exist in estimation of plant phenology using the ndvi and the gsi model for example the time of leaf onset or senescence does not always match custart or cuend for years under different precipitation in the alpine meadow ecosystem because carbon flux phenology captured by custart dates based on plant leaves is large enough to ensure that photosynthetic rate is higher than respiration and the time of custart general later than that of leaf onset similarly the cuend dates based on ecosystem respiration becomes larger than photosynthesis but plant growth may continue and senescence and dormancy processes should be later than cuend zhu et al 2013 in addition alpine ecosystem may become a net carbon source for a few days due to drought events chai et al 2017b which does not imply the end of growing season as a result ndvi cannot accurately estimate carbon flux phenology at a site scale instead a site based water and thermal integrated gsi index can do it because of high frequence of real time data avaibility from flux stations so gsi provides more detailed informations which just complement the shortcomings of the ndvi approach be used at single site we show that the gsi model can be well applied at site scale however there is a shortage for the gsi model to be applied at the broader scales because environmental data such as ta swc vpd are available in sites but difficult to gain at large scales so gsi has its disavanatage to be applied and scale up at broader scales compared with modis ndvi method but if given more hygrothermal data provided by increasing the number of flux tower sites accurate carbon flux phenology will be expected to be simulated by the gsi model at larger scales 4 2 carbon sequestration mediated by cup the driving of cup on carbon sequestration has been studied in many grassland and forest ecosystems evidence showed that the carbon exchange in land atmosphere system is sensitive to phenology barr et al 2004 grant et al 2012 kang et al 2016 white and nemani 2003 our resluts also suggested that inter annual variations in co2 fluxes were controlled by annual cup annual nep would increase by 1 63 g c m 2 year 1 if one cup day were extended the increased amplitudes in alpine meadow differed from those in other ecosystems richardson et al 2013 in general the increased nep values in forests were higher than that in grasslands for example the nep increased by 5 7 and 5 8 g c m 2 year 1 per extended cup day in a temperate broadleaf and a deciduous broadleaf forest respectively baldocchi and wilson 2001 churkina et al 2005 and the nep increased by 2 0 and 4 0 gc m 2 year 1 per extended growing season day for a savanna and an open grassland respectively ma et al 2007 the increase of carbon sequestration per extended cup day in the alpine steppe meadow by contrast is much lower than those of abovementioned grassland ecosystems bao et al 2014 perhaps due to low productivity limited by low temperature and frequent fluctuation of water availability 4 3 effects of water condition on cup temperature is the key determinant in vegetation phenology development cleland et al 2006 piao et al 2008 2011 meanwhile other environmental factors may also modulate vegetation phenology water availability is an important limiting factor to plant growth in the arid semiarid areas and the variability in phenology could be closely related to soil water conditions shen et al 2015 pls regression model analysis showed significant relationship of cup with maswc and mavpd fig 5b and it can be interpreted by the relationships between cup and custart and between custart and maswc mavpd the custart strongly controlled the length of cup and earlier custart could lengthen cup in the alpine meadow fig 5 this important date would be affected strongly by maswc mavpd and it could be aggravated by higher temperature mata or mats fig 6 because increasing temperature can cause water stress in shallow soil layers by enhancing evapotranspiration and therefore suppresses the growth and development of shallow rooted plants shen et al 2015 yu et al 2003 this can explain the unexpected positive relationship between temperature and custart in our study site in other words a better water condition would result in an earlier beginning of the cup and the prolonged duration of the cup could lead to increase of the annual carbon sequestration this result confirms that opinion that water availability often but not always constrained the initiation of spring custart when soil moisture is low even though temperature is sufficiently high ganjurjav et al 2016b ganjurjav et al 2016b and dorji et al 2013 observed similar results and suggested that water availability limited spring phenology on the qinghai tibetan plateau moreover shen et al 2015 also found that spring greening was more sensitive to inter annual variations in preseason precipitation in arid areas than in wetter areas in addition a study showed that plant production increased and phenology occurred earlier in wet years than in dry years in grassland ecosystem of californian swarbreck et al 2015 5 conclusions growing season index gsi model and modis phenology model were used to predict carbon flux phenology including custart cuend and cup based on 6 year continuous flux measurements at an alpine steppe meadow on the tibetan plateau results showed that the gsi model performed better than ndvi derived phenology to accurately predict the custart cuend and cup at the single site especially in wet year and drought year its detailed results can complement the shortcomings of the ndvi approach be used at single site additionally significant positive relationship was found between annual cup and nep and nep would increase by 1 63 gcm 2 year 1 if one cup day was extended the length of cup was determined by water condition swc and vpd which mainly affected the custart due to significant correlation of custart with the cup meanwhile higher temperature mata and mats can lead to delay in custart and further lead to decline in cup especially in dry year it suggests that global warming does not always promote plant growth and vegetation phenology in the semiarid alpine steppe meadow because it also can accelerate drought and shorten cup and thus decrease carbon sequestration acknowledgements this work was funded by the national natural science foundation of china nos

methodology considers temperature and particle organic carbon poc were used to determine the carrying capacity through scallop growth production and economic benefit the model was applied to the zhangzidao culture area in the north yellow sea the largest marine ranching of japanese scallops patinopecten yessoensis in china the studied area was divided into four boxes according to the temperature and depth gradients the results showed that the model could successfully capture the main characteristics of the observed environmental variables poc concentrations and biological behaviour of the cultured scallops the food availability showed seasonal variations the low temperature had also a great effect on the growth of the scallops in the south area during period of january to july in contrary the high temperature would cause high mortality rate of the scallops in the north area in september based on the production and profit the optimal seeding densities were estimated to be 82 500 105 000 82 500 60 000 in ha 1 respectively in the boxes1 2 3 and 4 there is the potential to increase the seeding density in the northeast area box 2 while the southwest area has already exceeded its capacity the successful application of the model suggests that it could be used as a management tool for estimating the production carrying capacity in the bottom culture systems keywords bottom culture scallop patinopecten yessoensis carrying capacity food availability temperature 1 introduction the shellfish aquaculture has been rapidly developed over the past few decades and the culture area expanded considerably fao 2012 according to the statistics of fishery departments in china the domestic consumption of shellfish products was 14 37 million metric tons in 2018 to meet the increasing demand for seafood china has explored various means to increase production in recent years one of which is the marine ranching in general marine ranching refers to the culture method that main fishery species are artificially bred in traditional fishing grounds for recovery of the declined fishery resources yang 2016 sixty four licenses have been issued for marine ranching areas nationwide until 2018 http www moa gov cn with the development of marine ranching it is increasingly concerned with environmental impact deterioration of aquaculture environment due to over stocking has caused high mortality rates of the cultured species zhou 2012 byron et al 2011 zhang et al 2016a the scallop patinopecten yessoensis is a cold water species originated from russia japan and north korean waters with rapid development of the scallop industry in china since 1980s it has become one of the most important species in aquaculture along the coast of bohai and yellow seas the largest marine ranching of scallops in china is located in the area surrounding zhangzidao island in the northern yellow sea however the high mortality of scallops in the culture area has occurred during the period of october 2014 and january 2018 which had caused a considerable economic losses of 1 26 billion cny https baike baidu com previous research has shown that over stocking was the main cause for the high mortality rate of the shellfish zhou 2012 byron et al 2011 zhang et al 2016b for sustainability of scallop aquaculture it is therefore essential to develop a predictive tool to estimate the stocking densities in marine ranching systems ecosystem models have been developed for various purposes including carrying capacity estimation and environmental impact prediction of bivalve aquaculture dowd 2005 shi et al 2011 ren et al 2010 2012 these models coupled biological components with physical process saurel et al 2014 guyondet et al 2015 ferreira and bricker 2016 filgueira et

development for bottom culture systems campbell and newell 1998 the objective of this study is to develop an ecosystem model which couples a physical model with a production model for predicting the scallop growth and estimating optimal production of scallop bottom culture in the coastal waters the model includes dynamics of particle organic carbon poc scallop energetics and population we designed four scenarios stocking densities to investigate the carrying capacity of bottom culture systems the model was also applied to assess the effect of the water temperature and food availability on scallop growth 2 model description following campbell and newell 1998 we developed a production model to estimate optimal production of the scallop p yessoensis scamod in bottom culture systems in contrast to campbell s and newell s work 1998 we introduced the concept of box model and dynamic water exchanges from outputs of the hydrodynamic model regional ocean modelling system roms the diagram of the scamod is shown in fig 1 the equations for scamod are listed in table 1 the forcing functions and state variables are listed in table 2 a box model concept is used to describe the flux of poc in the bottom culture layer in each box the model structure is identical and poc concentration is assumed to be uniformly mixed the exchange process plays a significant role on the transport and replenishment of nutrients in the sea dowd 2005 poc is the main food for shellfish growth in the bottom culture systems campbell and newell 1998 the exchange of poc depends on physical processes including the advection diffusion and convective mixing the exchange in a given time t between adjacent boxes is determined by exchange coefficient as δ e x t i k x e x i t e x i 1 t with k x representing the amount of water exchanged from e x i to e x i 1 the water exchange terms e x i were calculated from the output of the hydrodynamic model the poc in the boundary layer is exchanged by the vertical flux k 2 v k b λ p c p c b and advection flux e x p b then it is filtered by scallops and any bio deposition settled into the sediment for the scallop biomass m the source term comes from the scallop assimilation the sinks are presented as respiration cost of shell growth and mortality the mortality includes natural mortality and predation mortality the length λ of the scallops is determined by the total volume s and number n the parameters in table 2 are further described in the following section a dynamic energy budget model of the scallop has been developed zhang et al 2017 on the basis of deb theory kooijman 2000 2010 since 1986 when kooijman first proposed the deb theory based on κ value the deb model has been successfully used in the study of energy science of

growth of scallops the temperature and food availability are considered as the main factors to determine the shellfish production ren et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 the food uptake of scallops follows

changes of scallop physiology k t follows arrhenius relationship kooijman 2010 3 application 3 1 study area the scamod is applied to zhangzidao culture area in the north yellow sea zhangzidao is the largest bottom culture farm of the scallop in china with an area of 2 0 109 m2 and average depth of 40 m fig 2 it is dominated by semidiurnal tide with a mean tide range of 3 4 m the tidal current velocity ranges from 23 to 90 cm s 1 with an average of 48 cm s 1 zhang 2008 for application of the model the culture area is divided into 4 boxes according to hydrodynamic properties topography and the temperature gradient fig 2 the average bottom temperature in box1 and box2 are higher than the box3 and box4 the water depth in box1 is shallower than other boxes and the depth in box3 is deepest in this area in addition the sediment environment in box4 is almost covered by clay whereas the bottom in other boxes is largely covered with sandy sediments 3 2 data and parameters the environmental and biological data were collected from seasonal samplings during the period of 2014 and 2015 the sampling stations are shown in fig 2 we took surface 2 m below surface and bottom 2 m above bottom water samples in each station temperature and salinity were recorded on site using ysi6600 and alec aclw 500 ml water was filtered onto glass fiber filters gff 0 45 μm and stored in 20 c for analysis of chlorophyll similarly 250 ml was filtered on pre ashed gff for analysis of poc scallop growth and densities were collected at the same time in each sampling time about 60 scallops were collected with scallop trawling and frozen for measurement of shell length volume and dry tissue weight in the laboratory the mortalities are obtained from field observations jiang 2013 3 3 hydrodynamic model the three dimensional open source ocean model roms was used to simulate hydrodynamic properties shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 wilkin et al 2005 the model was implemented on a grid covering the yellow sea and bohai sea with horizontal grid size being 1 km by 1 km and there are 40 vertical σ layers the model was forced by the wind data from ecmwf era interim european centre for medium range weather forecasts atmospheric reanalysis from 1979 https www ecmwf int and tidal data from tpxo 7 2 topex poseidon global tidal model the initial values were form hycom hybird coordinate ocean model https hycom org the model was run for a period of august 2014 december 2015 the hourly exchange rates between boxes and boundaries were extracted from model outputs 3 4 scenario simulations the scamod was run for four scenarios representing four seeding densities during a period of august 2014 december 2015 scenario ii was the observed density scenario i seeding density of 60 000 in ividuals per ha scenario ii seeding density of 82 500 in ividuals per ha scenario ⅲ seeding density of 105 000 in ividuals per ha scenario ⅳ seeding density of 135 000 in ividuals per ha 4 results 4 1 temperature fig 3 a shows the interpolated observation temperature data at the red stars stations from july 5 to july 11 2015 the temperature ranged from 8 to 16 c in july 2015 with the minimum temperature in the southwest of the culture area fig 3b the waters with low temperature was transported from the bottom cold water in north yellow sea fig 3c shows the relative error analysis of the observation and simulation results the error analysis results indicated that the relative error changed between 0 5 to 0 5 c in most of the area the maximum negative bias occurred in the northeast of the study area with a value of 1 5 c while the maximum positive bias appeared in the southwest area with a value of 2 c 4 2 scallop production the simulations of scenario ii are presented in fig 4 overall the model generally matched the seasonal variations of poc concentrations the poc concentration was larger in box2 and box3 than in box1 and box4 especially in summer and autumn the poc concentration was higher in summer than in other seasons with the average value of 1 2 gc m 3 fig 5 shows the growth of scallops in each box under the four scenarios the poc content of the box2 was highest with fastest growth rate of scallop on the contrary the poc content of the box4 is lower than in other boxes with the slowest growth of the scallops during june to october in 2015 the growth of the scallops in the box4 was slower than in other three boxes the model reasonably reproduced the observed data of actual seeding density in scenario ⅱ the scenarios simulations indicate that the final size of scallops decreased with increase of seeding densities the averaged dry tissue weight of scallops in the four boxes under each scenario was 1 60 1 44 1 26 and 1 10 g ind 1 respectively fig 6 a box1 4 the length of the scallops was 58 25 56 24 53 80 and 51 80 mm ind 1 respectively fig 6b box1 4 the biomass was 1 72 1 99 1 93 and 1 92 g m 2 respectively fig 6c box1 4 from the simulation results of biomass the optimal seeding densities are 82 500 105 000 82 500 135 000 in ha 1 respectively in the boxes1 2 3 and 4 4 3 restricting factors for scallop growth the food functional response and temperature dependence curves of the four scenarios are shown in fig 7 smaller the value represents stronger restriction the food restriction becomes stronger as the seeding density increases the temperature dependence is the key limiting factor on the scallop growth in box1 and box2 during december 2014 to july 2015 in box3 and box4 the temperature dependence dominated from january 2015 to august 2015 both temperature and food restriction increased in box1 and box2 during september to november 2015 whereas the food restriction played a significant role in box3 and box4 in the same period 5 discussion an ecosystem model has been developed to assess environmental effect on scallop growth and to estimate the optimal production the application of the model has shown that it can reasonably reproduce the observed growth and production of scallops in the bottom culture system in zhangzidao the model could be used as a management tool to help set seeding densities to maximise economic benefits 5 1 mortality parameters the ecosystem models are powerful tools for investigating the dynamic characteristics of ecosystems and assessing system productive capacity farm management and ecosystem health dowd 2005 ren et al 2010 filgueira et al 2014 in the bottom culture system including zhangzidao the mortality of scallops is a sensitive parameter and the value is usually difficult to be estimated in this modelling exercise the mortality of the scallop was obtained from field experiments jiang 2013 the seeding densities and sediment types would affect the growth and mortality of the shellfish campbell and newell 1998 pouvreau et al 2000 bacher et al 2003 ren et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 in this study we combined the field investigation and the historical data to calculate the mortality parameters of the scallop the mortality rate of the one year round scallops would reach 80 the simulated biomass of scallops suggested that this calculation is close to the observed values 5 2 temperature restriction the zhangzidao culture area is greatly influenced by the yellow sea cold water current zhu et al 2018 the model simulations have shown that the yellow sea cold water current has reduced the water temperature to 7 c in summer when the growth rate of scallops was considerably low figs 3 and 7 in addition the cold water current remains consistently low during september to november 2015 consequently the food poc played a significant role in the box3 and box4 however the high temperature 20 c would cause high mortality and little growth of scallops in box1 and box2 in september fig 7 the cold water current causes considerable temperature fluctuation within a short period particularly in summer months the changes of water temperature including dramatic changes and fluctuations have significant impacts on the physiological and biochemical responses of marine organisms brucet et al 2012 scherr et al 2010 the temperature variability and frequency have different effects on the physiological and immune indexes of the scallop xu et al 2010 gao et al 2017 jiang et al 2016 liu 2016 scallops were transferred directly from rearing temperature 15 c to 5 10 or 20 c for the acute water temperature treatment the oxygen consumption and ammonia n excretion rates in the 20 c were significantly higher than in the gradual acclimatization jiang et al 2016 the short period acute change of water temperature is considered to be the main factor for high mortality of shellfish gao et al 2017 the rapid temperature fluctuation 15 22 15 c could cause high mortality rate of scallops from 13 to 33 this is much higher than under the low temperature fluctuation 15 6 15 c with the mortality rate of 13 gao et al 2017 the zhangzidao culture area is dominated by regular semidiurnal tides with high variability of the temperature gradient during half of a tidal cycle 6 h in summer fig 8 the selected dates were the spring tide dates during the spring tide the summer temperature fluctuation in a tidal period was more intense than in other periods the southwest area box4 had a large temperature gradient with variation greater than 4 c this could be one of the factors for higher mortality and lower growth in box 3 and box4 than in the box1 and box 2 during the summer period 5 3 food availability the model used the poc concentration as the forcing food variable to simulate the growth of the scallops simulations for four scenarios with different seeding densities were conducted to investigate the optimal seeding density of the scallops in the study area food availability to scallop growth showed strong seasonal variations fig 7 in addition water exchange rate between boxes can also affect the growth of scallops with indirect effect on food availability dowd 2005 shi et al 2011 reported that the kelp production decreased from the mouth to the end of the sungo bay which was consistent with the spatial variation of water exchange rate the current velocity ranged between 0 and 0 25 m s 1 with an average of 0 01 m s 1 fig 9 we have used the current observation data at a continuous monitoring station located at 122 9 e 38 85 n to verify the outputs of roms the maximum flow occurs near the four islands which would bring more food than in other waters the main current direction in spring and winter is from southeast into the northwest which would have resulted in higher food availability in box3 than in box1 fig 9 low temperature limited the scallop growth in spring and winter fig 7 in summer and autumn however the current direction is complex with the current in box4 flows from other boxes to outward fig 9 resulting poc less available for the scallop growth in this box than other boxes 5 4 evaluation of economic benefits optimal seeding density would have obvious economic benefits for the industry the market price of scallop larvae is about 0 05 cny ind 1 and one year old is sold for 40 cny kg 1 in 2018 https price 21food cn yurou shuichan ignoring other costs during the culture period we estimated the input output ratios fig 10 the optimal seeding density of the box1 and box3 is approximately 82 500 in ha 1 while the optimal density of the box2 is about 105 000 in ha 1 the four scenarios in the box4 are similar with optimal density of 60 000 in ha 1 overall the profits would be much lower from box4 than from other boxes the northern part of zhangzidao area would provide the highest economic profit 6 conclusion the present model can reasonably reproduce the environment characteristics and the growth of the scallop in zhangzidao adjacent area the model results have shown that the current stocking density is under optimal level in the northeast area whereas it is over stocked in the southwest area the modelling exercise has also identified uncertainty in the mortality parameter which requires accurate measurements nevertheless the model provides a mathematical tool to assess the culture strategies for planning and management of scallop bottom culture acknowledgements this work was supported by the strategic priority research program western pacific ocean system chinese

largest bottom culture farm of the scallop in china with an area of 2 0 109 m2 and average depth of 40 m fig 2 it is dominated by semidiurnal tide with a mean tide range of 3 4 m the tidal current velocity ranges from 23 to 90 cm s 1 with an average of 48 cm s 1 zhang 2008 for application of the model the culture area is divided into 4 boxes according to hydrodynamic properties topography and the temperature gradient fig 2 the average bottom temperature in box1 and box2 are higher than the box3 and box4 the water depth in box1 is shallower than other boxes and the depth in box3 is deepest in this area in addition the sediment environment in box4 is almost covered by clay whereas the bottom in other boxes is largely covered with sandy sediments 3 2 data and parameters the environmental and biological data were collected from seasonal samplings during the period of 2014 and 2015 the sampling stations are shown in fig 2 we took surface 2 m below surface and bottom 2 m above bottom water samples in each station temperature and salinity were recorded on site using ysi6600 and alec aclw 500 ml water was filtered onto glass fiber filters gff 0 45 μm and stored in 20 c for analysis of chlorophyll similarly 250 ml was filtered on pre ashed gff for analysis of poc scallop growth and densities were collected at the same time in each sampling time about 60 scallops were collected with scallop trawling and frozen for measurement of shell length volume and dry tissue weight in the laboratory the mortalities are obtained from field observations jiang 2013 3 3 hydrodynamic model the three dimensional open source ocean model roms was used to simulate hydrodynamic properties shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 wilkin et al 2005 the model was implemented on a grid covering the yellow sea and bohai sea with horizontal grid size being 1 km by 1 km and there are 40 vertical σ layers the model was forced by the wind data from ecmwf era interim european centre for medium range weather forecasts atmospheric reanalysis from 1979 https www ecmwf int and tidal data from tpxo 7 2 topex poseidon global tidal model the initial values were form hycom hybird coordinate ocean model https hycom org the model was run for a period of august 2014 december 2015 the hourly exchange rates between boxes and boundaries were extracted from model outputs 3 4 scenario simulations the scamod was run for four scenarios representing four seeding densities during a period of august 2014 december 2015 scenario ii was the observed density scenario i seeding density of 60 000 in ividuals per ha scenario ii seeding density of 82 500 in ividuals per ha scenario ⅲ seeding density of 105 000 in ividuals per ha scenario ⅳ seeding density of 135 000 in ividuals per ha 4 results 4 1 temperature fig 3 a shows the interpolated observation temperature data at the red stars stations from july 5 to july 11 2015 the temperature ranged from 8 to 16 c in july 2015 with the minimum temperature in the southwest of the culture area fig 3b the waters with low temperature was transported from the bottom cold water in north yellow sea fig 3c shows the relative error analysis of the observation and simulation results the error analysis results indicated that the relative error changed between 0 5 to 0 5 c in most of the area the maximum negative bias occurred in the northeast of the study area with a value of 1 5 c while the maximum positive bias appeared in the southwest area with a value of 2 c 4 2 scallop production the simulations of scenario ii are presented in fig 4 overall the model generally matched the seasonal variations of poc concentrations the poc concentration was larger in box2 and box3 than in box1 and box4 especially in summer and autumn the poc concentration was higher in summer than in other seasons with the average value of 1 2 gc m 3 fig 5 shows the growth of scallops in each box under the four scenarios the poc content of the box2 was highest with fastest growth rate of scallop on the contrary the poc content of the box4 is lower than in other boxes with the slowest growth of the scallops during june to october in 2015 the growth of the scallops in the box4 was slower than in other three boxes the model reasonably reproduced the observed data of actual seeding density in scenario ⅱ the scenarios simulations indicate that the final size of scallops decreased with increase of seeding densities the averaged dry tissue weight of scallops in the four boxes under each scenario was 1 60 1 44 1 26 and 1 10 g ind 1 respectively fig 6 a box1 4 the length of the scallops was 58 25 56 24 53 80 and 51 80 mm ind 1 respectively fig 6b box1 4 the biomass was 1 72 1 99 1 93 and 1 92 g m 2 respectively fig 6c box1 4 from the simulation results of biomass the optimal seeding densities are 82 500 105 000 82 500 135 000 in ha 1 respectively in the boxes1 2 3 and 4 4 3 restricting factors for scallop growth the food functional response and temperature dependence curves of the four scenarios are shown in fig 7 smaller the value represents stronger restriction the food restriction becomes stronger as the seeding density increases the temperature dependence is the key limiting factor on the scallop growth in box1 and box2 during december 2014 to july 2015 in box3 and box4 the temperature dependence dominated from january 2015 to august 2015 both temperature and food restriction increased in box1 and box2 during september to november 2015 whereas the food restriction played a significant role in box3 and box4 in the same period 5 discussion an ecosystem model has been developed to assess environmental effect on scallop growth and to estimate the optimal production the application of the model has shown that it can reasonably reproduce the observed growth and production of scallops in the bottom culture system in zhangzidao the model could be used as a management tool to help set seeding densities to maximise economic benefits 5 1 mortality parameters the ecosystem models are powerful tools for investigating the dynamic characteristics of ecosystems and assessing system productive capacity farm management and ecosystem health dowd 2005 ren et al 2010 filgueira et al 2014 in the bottom culture system including zhangzidao the mortality of scallops is a sensitive parameter and the value is usually difficult to be estimated in this modelling exercise the mortality of the scallop was obtained from field experiments jiang 2013 the seeding densities and sediment types would affect the growth and mortality of the shellfish campbell and newell 1998 pouvreau et al 2000 bacher et al 2003 ren et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 in this study we combined the field investigation and the historical data to calculate the mortality parameters of the scallop the mortality rate of the one year round scallops would reach 80 the simulated biomass of scallops suggested that this calculation is close to the observed values 5 2 temperature restriction the zhangzidao culture area is greatly influenced by the yellow sea cold water current zhu et al 2018 the model simulations have shown that the yellow sea cold water current has reduced the water temperature to 7 c in summer when the growth rate of scallops was considerably low figs 3 and 7 in addition the cold water current remains consistently low during september to november 2015 consequently the food poc played a significant role in the box3 and box4 however the high temperature 20 c would cause high mortality and little growth of scallops in box1 and box2 in september fig 7 the cold water current causes considerable temperature fluctuation within a short period particularly in summer months the changes of water temperature including dramatic changes and fluctuations have significant impacts on the physiological and biochemical responses of marine organisms brucet et al 2012 scherr et al 2010 the temperature variability and frequency have different effects on the physiological and immune indexes of the scallop xu et al 2010 gao et al 2017 jiang et al 2016 liu 2016 scallops were transferred directly from rearing temperature 15 c to 5 10 or 20 c for the acute water temperature treatment the oxygen consumption and ammonia n excretion rates in the 20 c were significantly higher than in the gradual acclimatization jiang et al 2016 the short period acute change of water temperature is considered to be the main factor for high mortality of shellfish gao et al 2017 the rapid temperature fluctuation 15 22 15 c could cause high mortality rate of scallops from 13 to 33 this is much higher than under the low temperature fluctuation 15 6 15 c with the mortality rate of 13 gao et al 2017 the zhangzidao culture area is dominated by regular semidiurnal tides with high variability of the temperature gradient during half of a tidal cycle 6 h in summer fig 8 the selected dates were the spring tide dates during the spring tide the summer temperature fluctuation in a tidal period was more intense than in other periods the southwest area box4 had a large temperature gradient with variation greater than 4 c this could be one of the factors for higher mortality and lower growth in box 3 and box4 than in the box1 and box 2 during the summer period 5 3 food availability the model used the poc concentration as the forcing food variable to simulate the growth of the scallops simulations for four scenarios with different seeding densities were conducted to investigate the optimal seeding density of the scallops in the study area food availability to scallop growth showed strong seasonal variations fig 7 in addition water exchange rate between boxes can also affect the growth of scallops with indirect effect on food availability dowd 2005 shi et al 2011 reported that the kelp production decreased from the mouth to the end of the sungo bay which was consistent with the spatial variation of water exchange rate the current velocity ranged between 0 and 0 25 m s 1 with an average of 0 01 m s 1 fig 9 we have used the current observation data at a continuous monitoring station located at 122 9 e 38 85 n to verify the outputs of roms the maximum flow occurs near the four islands which would bring more food than in other waters the main current direction in spring and winter is from southeast into the northwest which would have resulted in higher food availability in box3 than in box1 fig 9 low temperature limited the scallop growth in spring and winter fig 7 in summer and autumn however the current direction is complex with the current in box4 flows from other boxes to outward fig 9 resulting poc less available for the scallop growth in this box than other boxes 5 4 evaluation of economic benefits optimal seeding density would have obvious economic benefits for the industry the market price of scallop larvae is about 0 05 cny ind 1 and one year old is sold for 40 cny kg 1 in 2018 https price 21food cn yurou shuichan ignoring other costs during the culture period we estimated the input output ratios fig 10 the optimal seeding density of the box1 and box3 is approximately 82 500 in ha 1 while the optimal density of the box2 is about 105 000 in ha 1 the four scenarios in the box4 are similar with optimal density of 60 000 in ha 1 overall the profits would be much lower from box4 than from other boxes the northern part of zhangzidao area would provide the highest economic profit 6 conclusion the present model can reasonably reproduce the environment characteristics and the growth of the scallop in zhangzidao adjacent area the model results have shown that the current stocking density is under optimal level in the northeast area whereas it is over stocked in the southwest area the modelling exercise has also identified uncertainty in the mortality parameter which requires accurate measurements nevertheless the model provides a mathematical tool to assess the

25124,in theory parameters of dynamic n mixture models can be estimated with multiple years of data without the robust design under the assumption of constant detection probability however such an assumption can rarely be met in long term studies and the consequences of violating this assumption in the inferences of dynamic n mixture models have not been assessed in this study we used simulation studies to evaluate inferences of the original dynamic n mixture model and two of its spatial extensions in the face of temporal variability in detection probability we first evaluated the dynamic n mixture models when detection probability that varied temporally was wrongly treated as a constant we then evaluated if the robust design was necessary for dynamic n mixture models to provide valid parameter estimates when detection probability was correctly assumed to vary temporally our results showed that when detection probability that varied temporally was wrongly treated as a constant biases were introduced in the parameter estimates of dynamic n mixture models when detection probability was correctly assumed to vary temporally the models could provide valid parameter estimates with the robust design the model could also provide valid parameter estimates when detection probability was a random effect even without the robust design based on our results we strongly recommended considering temporal variability in detection probability when using dynamic n mixture models to analyze long term data and adopting the robust design in long term surveys our work here is not only useful for data analysis but also important for research design and thus are relevant to a wide range of studies keywords count data dail and madsen model connectivity demography metapopulation n mixture model observation error spatial models 1 introduction ecologists have long sought to understand demographic processes such as survival reproduction emigration and immigration in population and metapopulation dynamics traditionally demographic parameters are estimated with data based on marked individual animals such as band recovery data capture recapture data or telemetry data pollock 1991 williams et al 2002 royle et al 2013 the development of the dynamic n mixture models dail and madsen 2011 allows estimation of demographic parameters and local population size while accounting for imperfect detection based on count data of unmarked individuals obtained at multiple spatial locations and sampling periods as a result the dynamic n mixture models provide opportunities to understand metapopulation dynamics using count data that in general are easier to obtain than capture recapture data the original dynamic n mixture model has been further developed to account for movement among local populations hostetler and chandler 2015 zhao et al 2017 multiple states zipkin et al 2014 direnzo et al 2018 other types of data rossman et al 2016 zipkin et al 2017 ketz et al 2018 density dependent processes and environmental stochasticity bellier et al 2016 and use of gaussian approximations brintz et al 2018 table 1 despite the many extensions of dynamic n mixture models inference of these models in the face of temporal variability in detection probability is still poorly understood while in theory parameters in the dynamic n mixture models can be estimated with multiple years of data even when there is only one single visit each year the inference is based on the assumption that detection probability is constant over years such an assumption however is unlikely to be met in long term studies for example the detection probability may increase when observers gain more experience sauer and link 2011 detection probability may also vary across years due to differences in observation conditions the effects of accounting for variability in detection probability have been well studied for occupancy models and n mixture models denes et al 2015 guillera arroita 2017 but are still poorly understood for dynamic n mixture models in particular since dynamic n mixture models unlike the n mixture models are expected to be used with long term data it is important to examine the effects of temporal variability in detection probability on the inference of these models in this study we focused on the original dynamic n mixture model dail and madsen 2011 and two of its spatial extensions hostetler and chandler 2015 zhao et al 2017 first we aimed to evaluate inference for these models when detection probability that varied temporally was wrongly assumed to be a constant second we aimed to examine if the robust sampling design was necessary for these models to provide valid parameter estimates when detection probability was correctly assumed to vary temporally we performed these evaluations using simulation studies based on our results we provided suggestions for studies that aim to use the dynamic n mixture models in data analyses and sampling design 2 methods 2 1 the original dynamic n mixture model the original dynamic n mixture model dail and madsen 2011 assumes that local population size is driven by two demographic parameters apparent survival and recruitment here apparent survival equals true survival minus emigration and recruitment equals reproduction plus immigration in the process model of the original dynamic n mixture model local population size for the first year is assumed to follow a poisson distribution such that n j 1 p o i s s o n λ 0 for habitat patches j 1 2 j in subsequent years t 2 apparent survivors in habitat patch j and year t a j t are assumed to follow a binomial distribution such at a j t b i n o m i a l n j t 1 φ in which φ is the probability an individual survives and stays in the same habitat patch i e apparent survival probability the number of recruits g j t is assumed to follow a poisson distribution such that g j t p o i s s o n λ where λ is the expectation of recruitment local population size from the second year is then determined by n j t a j t g j t 2 2 hostetler chandler model an extension of the original dynamic n mixture model allows the separation of immigration from reproduction hostetler and chandler 2015 this model makes the same assumption for local population size in the first year in subsequent years the hostetler chandler model also assumes that apparent survival follows a binomial distribution in the same way as the original dynamic n mixture model does this model assumes that reproduction r j t follows a poisson distribution such that r j t p o i s s o n γ n j t 1 in which γ is the expected reproduction per capita this model also assumes that immigration i j t follows a poisson distribution such that i j t p o i s s o n δ in which δ is the expected number of immigrants in this way the model separates reproduction from immigration and allows an extinct local population to be rescued through the process of immigration local population size from the second year is then determined by n j t a j t r j t i j t 2 3 spatially explicit dynamic n mixture model the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture models separate emigration and immigration from true survival and reproduction respectively and builds a connection between emigration and immigration zhao et al 2017 in the sense that immigrants to one patch must be emigrants from other patches this model makes the same assumption for local population size in the first year as the original dynamic n mixture model in subsequent years true survival s j t is assumed to follow a binomial distribution such that the number of survivors s j t b i n o m i a l n j t 1 ω where ω is the probability of survival further emigration e j t is assumed to follow a binomial distribution such that the number of emigrants e j t b i n o m i a l s j t κ where κ was the probability of emigration as in the hostetler chandler model the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture model also assumes that reproduction r j t follows a poisson distribution such that r j t p o i s s o n γ n j t 1 however the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture model assumes that immigration i j t follows a poisson distribution such that i j t p o i s s o n i 1 n w j i e i t in which w j i is the weight that governs the contribution of the emigration from habitat patch i to the immigration to habitat patch j and n is the total number of habitat patches in this way the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture models builds a connection between emigration and immigration local population size from the second year is then determined by n j t s j t e j t r j t i j t note that a general form of the spatially explicit model assumes that w j i is a function of the distance between habitat patches j and i the relationship between w j i and distance is governed by a decay parameter which needs to be estimated in this study we adopted a specific form of this model in which movement was assumed to occur only among adjacent habitat patches under this assumption we simplified the model so that w j i 1 n i a d j if patches j and i were adjacent to each other and 0 otherwise and where n i a d j was the number of adjacent habitat patches of habitat patch i thus no parameter needs to be estimated in the immigration sub model 2 4 imperfect detection dynamic n mixture models allow estimating demographic parameters while accounting for imperfect detection to consider temporal variability in detection probability we assumed that the observed counts y j t k in patch j year t and during survey replicate k 1 2 k follow a binomial distribution such that y j t k b i n o m i a l n j t p t o b s in which p t o b s is a detection probability that varies temporally detection probability p t o b s was further treated as a fixed effect or a random effect when treated as a random effect we assumed that logit p t o b s n o r m a l μ p σ p 2 in which μ p and σ p 2 were the mean and variance of logit detection probability respectively alternatively we could assume constant detection probability p o b s and thus y j t k b i n o m i a l n j t p o b s note that a survey with the robust design means that at least some of the patches were visited multiple times during a primary sampling period and a survey without robust design meant that all the patches were only visited once during each primary sampling period i e k 1 2 5 simulation study we conducted simulation studies to examine inferences of the three dynamic n mixture models described above i e original hostetler chandler and spatially explicit in the face of temporal variability in detection probability in all simulations we simulated count data for 25 habitat patches in 5 5 grid cells over 20 years with an expected initial local population size λ 0 of 5 we considered two sets of constant demographic parameters representing two species with distinct life history characteristics first we considered a species with high survival low productivity and moderate connectivity among local populations for this species for the original dynamic n mixture model apparent survival probability φ was 0 56 and the expectation of recruitment λ was 2 2 for the hostetler chandler model apparent survival probability φ was 0 56 reproduction per capita γ was 0 2 and the expectation of immigration δ was 1 2 for the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture model true survival probability ω was 0 8 emigration probability κ was 0 3 and reproduction per capita γ was 0 2 second we considered a species with low survival high productivity and high connectivity among local populations for this species for the original dynamic n mixture model apparent survival probability φ was 0 16 and the expectation of recruitment λ was 4 2 for the hostetler chandler model apparent survival probability φ was 0 16 reproduction per capita γ was 0 6 and the expectation of immigration δ was 1 2 for the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture model true survival probability ω was 0 4 emigration probability κ was 0 6 and reproduction per capita γ was 0 6 we considered the situations that time varying detection probability p t o b s was a fixed effect or a random effect when detection probability was a fixed effect detection probability for each year was randomly drawn from a uniform distribution ranging from 0 2 to 0 8 when p t o b s was a random effect logit p t o b s was drawn from a normal distribution with mean μ p being 0 and variance σ p 2 being 0 48 we conducted three analyses when analyzing the simulated data first we simulated data with a detection probability that varied temporally and sampling occurred using the robust design k 3 and analyzed the simulated data using the data generating model true model with robust design second we analyzed the same data in the first analysis using models assuming a constant detection probability wrong model with robust design third we simulated data with a detection probability that varied temporally and sampling was without the robust design k 1 and analyzed the simulated data using the data generating model true model without robust design by comparing the results of the first and second analyses we aimed to evaluate the inference of dynamic n mixture models when detection probability varied temporally but was wrongly treated as a constant by comparing the results of the first and third analyses we aimed to evaluate if the robust design was necessary for dynamic n mixture models to provide valid parameter estimates when detection probability was correctly assumed to vary temporally we conducted 100 simulations for each combination of the three dynamic n mixture models two species two situations of detection probability and three analyses resulting in a total of 3600 simulations for this study we compared the distributions of the posterior means to the true values of the detection probability initial population size and demographic parameters as an evaluation of the inference of the models we analyzed the models using a bayesian framework with simulation from the posterior distribution by markov chain monte carlo mcmc in the software jags plummer 2003 called from r r development core team 2013 using the package jagsui kellner 2015 we used vague priors gamma 0 001 0 001 for λ 0 λ γ and δ and uniform 0 1 for φ ω and κ when p o b s was treated as a constant or when p t o b s was treated as a fixed effect we used uniform 0 1 as priors when p t o b s was treated as a random effect we used normal 0 100 for μ p and gamma 0 001 0 001 for σ p 2 as priors we used 5 chains 2000 iterations of adaption and 140 000 iterations including 100 000 burn in to yield 200 000 posterior samples for each parameter we checked the convergence of the mcmc computing using the diagnostic plot of the posterior samples and brooks gelman rubin diagnostics where r ˆ 1 05 was considered indicative of convergence brooks and gelman 1998 3 results our results showed that the original dynamic n mixture model the hostetler chandler model and the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture model provided valid estimates of detection probability initial population size and demographic parameters when detection probability was correctly assumed to vary temporally and the robust design was used figs 1 and 2 when detection probability was wrongly assumed to be a constant errors in the estimated detection probabilities still centered on zero but became large for all three models wrongly assuming a constant detection probability did not seem to lead to biased estimates of initial population size however these models provided biased estimates of demographic parameters in most cases when detection probability was wrongly assumed to be a constant figs 1 and 2 the patterns were consistent for the two species with distinct life history traits the results also showed that when detection probability was a fixed effect the models provided biased estimates for the detection probability as well as a few other demographic parameters without the robust design figs 1 and 2 when detection probability was a random effect we did not find evidence for biased parameter estimates even without the robust design the precision of parameter estimates were nonetheless higher when the robust design was used again the patterns were consistent for the two species with distinct life history traits 4 discussion our results show that wrongly assuming constant detection probability could lead to biased estimates of demographic parameters in dynamic n mixture models by contrast when detection probability is correctly assumed to vary temporally the models could provide valid parameter estimates when the robust design is used dynamic n mixture models in comparison to traditional population and metapopulation models turchin 2003 assume separate stochasticity for different demographic processes for example in the original dynamic n mixture model apparent survival follows a binomial distribution and recruitment follows a poisson distribution consequently recruitment has a higher variance than apparent survival when the expectation is the same for example when local population size was n t apparent survival probability was φ and recruitment rate was n t φ both recruitment and apparent survival have an expectation of n t φ but recruitment has a higher variance n t φ than apparent survival n t φ 1 φ when detection probability that varies temporally is wrongly assumed to be a constant variation in the observation process is included as a part of variation in local population size consequently the original dynamic n mixture model tends to overestimate recruitment and underestimate apparent survival to explain the additional variation in local population size similarly the hostetler chandler model and the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture model also tend to provide biased estimates of demographic parameters when detection probability is wrongly assumed to be a constant even though our study focuses on the original dynamic n mixture model and two of its spatial extensions we believe that our findings could hold for other extensions of the original dynamic n mixture model table 1 interestingly when temporal variability in detection probability is correctly accounted for dynamic n mixture models could provide valid parameter estimates when detection probability is a random effect even without the robust sampling design some biases were found when detection probability is a fixed effect although these biases were relatively small these results indicate that studies should consider accounting for temporal variability in detection probability when using dynamic n mixture models even when the robust design is not used in the survey this is particularly meaningful for long term surveys that cover large spatial extents because the robust design may not be applicable in such surveys e g the north american breeding bird survey the choice of treating detection probability as a fixed or random effect depends on the nature of the survey treating detection probability as a random effect seems to be reasonable when the survey protocol is consistent over time and treating detection probability as a fixed effect is likely to be appropriate when the survey has undergone frequent fundamental changes because inferences for dynamic n mixture models are better when detection probability is a random effect than when detection probability is a fixed effect we believe that it is beneficial to keep survey protocols consistent in long term studies valid inferences in the dynamic n mixture model are achieved when the robust design is used when detection probability is correctly assumed to vary temporally both accuracy and precision of parameter estimates are largely improved by using the robust design such improvement is especially important for studies that aim to understand the spatiotemporal variability in demography and detect trends in local population dynamics zipkin and saunders 2018 when the robust design is not applicable researchers could consider using other approaches such as distance sampling royle et al 2004 or observational covariates sólymos et al 2012 to facilitate the estimation of detection probability for detailed studies that are conducted at relatively fine spatial scales a combination of several approaches e g robust design and distance sampling could be considered yamaura and royle 2017 integrating relatively expensive demographic data e g capture recapture data at small spatial extent with count data at large spatial extent in dynamic n mixture models could be another important direction of future research zipkin and saunders 2018 in this study we assumed that demographic parameters are constant which is unlikely to be true in real world studies nonetheless we believe that our simulations clearly show that it is important to consider temporal variability in detection probability in dynamic n mixture models an issue that has long been ignored in case studies bellier et al 2018 we acknowledge that ignoring temporal variability in demographic parameters may also lead to biased parameter estimates bellier et al 2016 and highly recommend considering temporal variability in both demographic parameters and detection probability in real world studies furthermore future studies can consider to incorporate advanced bayesian model selection approaches hooten and hobbs 2015 in these models to determine the optimal complexity of model structures in summary our study shows the importance of considering temporal variability in detection probability in dynamic n mixture models furthermore our study is useful not only for the analyses of existing data sets but also can provide important guidance for future survey designs in particularly our study highlights the importance of using the robust design or other approaches so that accurate precise estimates of demographic parameters could be achieved with count data when detection probability of unmarked animals

however is unlikely to be met in long term studies for example the detection probability may increase when observers gain more experience sauer and link 2011 detection probability may also vary across years due to differences in observation conditions the effects of accounting for variability in detection probability have been well studied for occupancy models and n mixture models denes et al 2015 guillera arroita 2017 but are still poorly understood for dynamic n mixture models in particular since dynamic n mixture models unlike the n mixture models are expected to be used with long term data it is important to examine the effects of temporal variability in detection probability on the inference of these models in this study we focused on the original dynamic n mixture model dail and madsen 2011 and two of its spatial extensions hostetler and chandler 2015 zhao et al 2017 first we aimed to evaluate inference for these models when detection probability that varied temporally was wrongly assumed to be a constant second we aimed to examine if the robust sampling design was necessary for these models to provide valid parameter estimates when detection probability was correctly assumed to vary temporally we performed these evaluations using simulation studies based on our results we provided suggestions for studies that aim to use the dynamic n mixture models in data analyses and sampling design 2 methods 2 1 the original dynamic n mixture model the original dynamic n mixture model dail and madsen 2011 assumes that local population size is driven by two demographic parameters apparent survival and recruitment here apparent survival equals true survival minus emigration and recruitment equals reproduction plus immigration in the process model of the original dynamic n mixture model local population size for the first year is assumed to follow a poisson distribution such that n j 1 p o i s s o n λ 0 for habitat patches j 1 2 j in subsequent years t 2 apparent survivors in habitat patch j and year t a j t are assumed to follow a binomial distribution such at a j t b i n o m i a l n j t 1 φ in which φ is the probability an individual survives and stays in the same habitat patch i e apparent survival probability the number of recruits g j t is assumed to follow a poisson distribution such that g j t p o i s s o n λ where λ is the expectation of recruitment local population size from the second year is then determined by n j t a j t g j t 2 2 hostetler chandler model an extension of the original dynamic n mixture model allows the separation of immigration from reproduction hostetler and chandler 2015 this model makes the same assumption for local population size in the first year in subsequent years the hostetler chandler model also assumes that apparent survival follows a binomial distribution in the same way as the original dynamic n mixture model does this model assumes that reproduction r j t follows a poisson distribution such that r j t p o i s s o n γ n j t 1 in which γ is the expected reproduction per capita this model also assumes that immigration i j t follows a poisson distribution such that i j t p o i s s o n δ in which δ is the expected number of immigrants in this way the model separates reproduction from immigration and allows an extinct local population to be rescued through the process of immigration local population size from the second year is then determined by n j t a j t r j t i j t 2 3 spatially explicit dynamic n mixture model the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture models separate emigration and immigration from true survival and reproduction respectively and builds a connection between emigration and immigration zhao et al 2017 in the sense that immigrants to one patch must be emigrants from other patches this model makes the same assumption for local population size in the first year as the original dynamic n mixture model in subsequent years true survival s j t is assumed to follow a binomial distribution such that the number of survivors s j t b i n o m i a l n j t 1 ω where ω is the probability of survival further emigration e j t is assumed to follow a binomial distribution such that the number of emigrants e j t b i n o m i a l s j t κ where κ was the probability of emigration as in the hostetler chandler model the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture model also assumes that reproduction r j t follows a poisson distribution such that r j t p o i s s o n γ n j t 1 however the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture model assumes that immigration i j t follows a poisson distribution such that i j t p o i s s o n i 1 n w j i e i t in which w j i is the weight that governs the contribution of the emigration from habitat patch i to the immigration to habitat patch j and n is the total number of habitat patches in this way the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture models builds a connection between emigration and immigration local population size from the second year is then determined by n j t s j t e j t r j t i j t note that a general form of the spatially explicit model assumes that w j i is a function of the distance between habitat patches j and i the relationship between w j i and distance is governed by a decay parameter which needs to be estimated in this study we adopted a specific form of this model in which movement was assumed to occur only among adjacent habitat patches under this assumption we simplified the model so that w j i 1 n i a d j if patches j and i were adjacent to each other and 0 otherwise and where n i a d j was the number of adjacent habitat patches of habitat patch i thus no parameter needs to be estimated in the immigration sub model 2 4 imperfect detection dynamic n mixture models allow estimating demographic parameters while accounting for imperfect detection to consider temporal variability in detection probability we assumed that the observed counts y j t k in patch j year t and during survey replicate k 1 2 k follow a binomial distribution such that y j t k b i n o m i a l n j t p t o b s in which p t o b s is a detection probability that varies temporally detection probability p t o b s was further treated as a fixed effect or a random effect when treated as a random effect we assumed that logit p t o b s n o r m a l μ p σ p 2 in which μ p and σ p 2 were the mean and variance of logit detection probability respectively alternatively we could assume constant detection probability p o b s and thus y j t k b i n o m i a l n j t p o b s note that a survey with the robust design means that at least some of the patches were visited multiple times during a primary sampling period and a survey without robust design meant that all the patches were only visited once during each primary sampling period i e k 1 2 5 simulation study we conducted simulation studies to examine inferences of the three dynamic n mixture models described above i e original hostetler chandler and spatially explicit in the face of temporal variability in detection probability in all simulations we simulated count data for 25 habitat patches in 5 5 grid cells over 20 years with an expected initial local population size λ 0 of 5 we considered two sets of constant demographic parameters representing two species with distinct life history characteristics first we considered a species with high survival low productivity and moderate connectivity among local populations for this species for the original dynamic n mixture model apparent survival probability φ was 0 56 and the expectation of recruitment λ was 2 2 for the hostetler chandler model apparent survival probability φ was 0 56 reproduction per capita γ was 0 2 and the expectation of immigration δ was 1 2 for the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture model true survival probability ω was 0 8 emigration probability κ was 0 3 and reproduction per capita γ was 0 2 second we considered a species with low survival high productivity and high connectivity among local populations for this species for the original dynamic n mixture model apparent survival probability φ was 0 16 and the expectation of recruitment λ was 4 2 for the hostetler chandler model apparent survival probability φ was 0 16 reproduction per capita γ was 0 6 and the expectation of immigration δ was 1 2 for the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture model true survival probability ω was 0 4 emigration probability κ was 0 6 and reproduction per capita γ was 0 6 we considered the situations that time varying detection probability p t o b s was a fixed effect or a random effect when detection probability was a fixed effect detection probability for each year was randomly drawn from a uniform distribution ranging from 0 2 to 0 8 when p t o b s was a random effect logit p t o b s was drawn from a normal distribution with mean μ p being 0 and variance σ p 2 being 0 48 we conducted three analyses when analyzing the simulated data first we simulated data with a detection probability that varied temporally and sampling occurred using the robust design k 3 and analyzed the simulated data using the data generating model true model with robust design second we analyzed the same data in the first analysis using models assuming a constant detection probability wrong model with robust design third we simulated data with a detection probability that varied temporally and sampling was without the robust design k 1 and analyzed the simulated data using the data generating model true model without robust design by comparing the results of the first and second analyses we aimed to evaluate the inference of dynamic n mixture models when detection probability varied temporally but was wrongly treated as a constant by comparing the results of the first and third analyses we aimed to evaluate if the robust design was necessary for dynamic n mixture models to provide valid parameter estimates when detection probability was correctly assumed to vary temporally we conducted 100 simulations for each combination of the three dynamic n mixture models two species two situations of detection probability and three analyses resulting in a total of 3600 simulations for this study we compared the distributions of the posterior means to the true values of the detection probability initial population size and demographic parameters as an evaluation of the inference of the models we analyzed the models using a bayesian framework with simulation from the posterior distribution by markov chain monte carlo mcmc in the software jags plummer 2003 called from r r development core team 2013 using the package jagsui kellner 2015 we used vague priors gamma 0 001 0 001 for λ 0 λ γ and δ and uniform 0 1 for φ ω and κ when p o b s was treated as a constant or when p t o b s was treated as a fixed effect we used uniform 0 1 as priors when p t o b s was treated as a random effect we used normal 0 100 for μ p and gamma 0 001 0 001 for σ p 2 as priors we used 5 chains 2000 iterations of adaption and 140 000 iterations including 100 000 burn in to yield 200 000 posterior samples for each parameter we checked the convergence of the mcmc computing using the diagnostic plot of the posterior samples and brooks gelman rubin diagnostics where r ˆ 1 05 was considered indicative of convergence brooks and gelman 1998 3 results our results showed that the original dynamic n mixture model the hostetler chandler model and the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture model provided valid estimates of detection probability initial population size and demographic parameters when detection probability was correctly assumed to vary temporally and the robust design was used figs 1 and 2 when detection probability was wrongly assumed to be a constant errors in the estimated detection probabilities still centered on zero but became large for all three models wrongly assuming a constant detection probability did not seem to lead to biased estimates of initial population size however these models provided biased estimates of demographic parameters in most cases when detection probability was wrongly assumed to be a constant figs 1 and 2 the patterns were consistent for the two species with distinct life history traits the results also showed that when detection probability was a fixed effect the models provided biased estimates for the detection probability as well as a few other demographic parameters without the robust design figs 1 and 2 when detection probability was a random effect we did not find evidence for biased parameter estimates even without the robust design the precision of parameter estimates were nonetheless higher when the robust design was used again the patterns were consistent for the two species with distinct life history traits 4 discussion our results show that wrongly assuming constant detection probability could lead to biased estimates of demographic parameters in dynamic n mixture models by contrast when detection probability is correctly assumed to vary temporally the models could provide valid parameter estimates when the robust design is used dynamic n mixture models in comparison to traditional population and metapopulation models turchin 2003 assume separate stochasticity for different demographic processes for example in the original dynamic n mixture model apparent survival follows a binomial distribution and recruitment follows a poisson distribution consequently recruitment has a higher variance than apparent survival when the expectation is the same for example when local population size was n t apparent survival probability was φ and recruitment rate was n t φ both recruitment and apparent survival have an expectation of n t φ but recruitment has a higher variance n t φ than apparent survival n t φ 1 φ when detection probability that varies temporally is wrongly assumed to be a constant variation in the observation process is included as a part of variation in local population size consequently the original dynamic n mixture model tends to overestimate recruitment and underestimate apparent survival to explain the additional variation in local population size similarly the hostetler chandler model and the spatially explicit dynamic n mixture model also tend to provide biased estimates of demographic parameters when detection probability is wrongly assumed to be a constant even though our study focuses on the original dynamic n mixture model and two of its spatial extensions we believe that our findings could hold for other extensions of the original dynamic n mixture model table 1 interestingly when temporal variability in detection probability is correctly accounted for dynamic n mixture models could provide valid parameter estimates when detection probability is a random effect even without the robust sampling design some biases were found when detection probability is a fixed effect although these biases were relatively small these results indicate that studies should consider accounting for temporal variability in detection probability when using dynamic n mixture models even when the robust design is not used in the survey this is particularly meaningful for long term surveys that cover large spatial extents because the robust design may not be applicable in such surveys e g the north american breeding bird survey the choice of treating detection probability as a fixed or random effect depends on the nature of the survey treating detection probability as a random effect seems to be reasonable when the survey protocol is consistent over time and treating detection probability as a fixed effect is likely to be appropriate when the survey has undergone frequent fundamental changes because inferences for dynamic n mixture models are better when detection probability is a random effect than when detection probability is a fixed effect we believe that it is beneficial to keep survey protocols consistent in long term studies valid inferences in the dynamic n mixture model are achieved when the robust design is used when detection probability is correctly assumed to vary temporally both accuracy and precision of parameter estimates are largely improved by using the robust design such improvement is especially important for studies that aim to understand the spatiotemporal variability in demography and detect trends in local population dynamics zipkin and saunders 2018 when the robust design is not applicable researchers could consider using other approaches such as distance sampling royle et al 2004 or observational covariates sólymos et al 2012 to facilitate the estimation of detection probability for detailed studies that are conducted at relatively fine spatial scales a combination of several approaches e g robust design and distance sampling could be considered yamaura and royle 2017 integrating relatively expensive demographic data e g capture recapture data at small spatial extent with count data at large spatial extent in dynamic n mixture models could be another important direction of future research zipkin and saunders 2018 in this study we assumed that demographic parameters are constant which is unlikely to be true in real world studies nonetheless we believe that our simulations clearly show that it is important to consider temporal variability in detection probability in dynamic n mixture models an issue that has long been ignored in case studies bellier et al 2018 we acknowledge that ignoring temporal variability in demographic parameters may also lead to biased parameter estimates bellier et al 2016 and highly recommend considering temporal variability in both demographic parameters and detection probability in real world studies furthermore future studies can consider to incorporate advanced bayesian model selection approaches hooten and hobbs 2015 in these models to determine the optimal complexity of model structures in summary our study shows the importance of considering temporal variability in detection probability in dynamic n mixture models furthermore our study is useful not only for the analyses of existing data sets but also can provide important guidance for future survey designs in particularly our study highlights the importance of using the robust design or other approaches so that accurate precise estimates of demographic parameters could be achieved with count data when detection probability of unmarked animals
