4945,carbonate aquifers represent an essential source of water supply worldwide although they generally have a high intrinsic vulnerability this results in an elevated risk of groundwater contamination and for human health in case of hazardous anthropic activities such as mining hence for addressing the pollution issues of these strategic groundwater resources and planning their optimal management as well detailed surveys based on a comprehensive approach are required this work concerns the issues tied to the coexistence of abandoned mining activities and valuable groundwater it provides the case of a past mining district on the apuan alps northwestern tuscany italy where the local carbonate aquifers host abundant groundwater resources threatened by acid mine drainages and thallium contaminated surface waters the research focuses on three important springs among which only one is tapped for drinking use the main goal was to investigate the origin and hydrochemical evolution of groundwater and to evaluate their possible interactions with sources of potentially toxic elements from september 2017 to december 2018 we performed nine sampling fields on contaminated stream and spring waters as well as chemical major and trace elements and isotopic analysis δ18o and δ2h in addition to continuative monitoring of hydrologic physical chemical parameters we also periodically sampled four low yield springs located in the studied catchment in order to characterize the isotopic signal of the infiltration water and identify the main recharge areas of groundwater systems we recognize two different groundwater flow systems feeding the main springs the first one drained by the two not tapped springs is shallower as evidenced by the over time evolution of water temperature electrical conductivity and isotopic signatures the tl concentration and its variability during the study period which follows the pattern showed by the stream indicates the likely hydraulic connectivity between the stream and these springs the second system feeding the captured spring is wider and deeper than the former and is characterized by longer residence times the higher temperature and electrical conductivity along with the constant o h isotopic composition support such a hypothesis the chemical evolution of the springs starts from a pure ca hco3 end member therefore evolving into two different chemical types on one side because of the hydraulic connection between the contaminated stream water and the shallower groundwater flow system significant concentrations so4 tl and other potentially toxic elements occur in the not tapped springs compromising their quality on the other hand the deepening of the flow component drained by the tapped ca so4 hco3 spring may lead to the dissolution of gypsum anhydrite layers thus producing water enriched in so4 and sr although tl and other potentially toxic elements present very low concentrations therefore the groundwater system feeding this spring appears to be protected from contamination events linked to the tl polluted stream water moreover we assessed a very similar recharge average altitude for the two groundwater flow systems ranging from about 350 m to 450 m a s l in this sector of the catchment some dismissed mines develop thus representing a potential source of potentially toxic elements not only through surface acid drainages but also via direct underground transfer the obtained results highlight the importance of an integrated approach for understanding in detail the groundwater dynamics in complex carbonate aquifers threatened by legacy mining keywords groundwater karst aquifers drinkable spring water acid mine drainages thallium apuan alps 1 introduction groundwater represents a vital natural resource and an essential part of the hydrologic cycle disregarding the large quantity stored in ice caps and glaciers 96 of all freshwater existing on the earth is stored within the aquifer systems for a total estimated volume of about 10 5 million km3 richts et al 2011 in addition to industrial and agricultural use 25 of worldwide groundwater consumption is related to the drinking water supply hiscock 2011 due to its good quality and high reliability zhu and balke 2008 this percentage rises to about 70 in the european union hiscock 2011 and the dry northern and north western regions of china jane 2010 global groundwater withdrawals are constantly increasing in recent decades especially in the agricultural sector famiglietti 2014 while climate change threatens the future availability of water resources kløve et al 2014 wwap 2019 hence the need to protect groundwater against contamination and quantity deterioration doveri et al 2015 hölting and coldewey 2019 especially in areas where anthropogenic pressures exist in many areas of the world carbonate aquifers especially karst aquifers hold significant groundwater resources that represent an essential source of water supply for entire regions and megacities bakalowicz 2005 ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 kalhor et al 2019 in europe water resources hosted in carbonate rocks satisfy approximately 50 of water demand for human consumption andreo et al 2008 despite the natural quality of these large underground reserves is often excellent doveri et al 2019a carbonate aquifers are particularly vulnerable to the contamination kazakis et al 2018 especially in areas affected by mining and quarrying activities zhang et al 2016 he et al 2019 piccini et al 2019 well developed fractures and conduits shaped by dissolution processes affect surface and sub surface drainage resulting in high flow velocity and short residence time marín and andreo 2015 doveri et al 2019a contaminants can quickly reach the groundwater and disperse over large distances jiménez madrid et al 2019 the strategic role of these aquifers is therefore threatened and often compromised by the release of toxic and potentially toxic elements pte to the environment in dismissed and abandoned mining sites nordstrom 2011 cidu et al 2009 ghezzi et al 2019 qin et al 2019 detailed investigations on dynamics and mechanisms regulating these systems are required to ensure preservation from pollution correct intended use and optimal management of water resources for this purpose here we present a case study from a past mining area in italy northwestern tuscany where a multi tool survey aimed to define the possible processes threatening spring water the apuan alps tuscany region italy represent one of the most important karst areas in italy and europe well known from a speleological point of view piccini 2013 hosting large quantities of groundwater resources within metamorphic and non metamorphic carbonate aquifer systems piccini et al 1999 doveri et al 2019a there are 260 caves with a length of more than 100 m whereas the overall cave system extends for over 325 km federazione speleologica toscana 2006 these data testify the exceptional development of karst conduits in the percolation vadose zone and emphasize the highly karstic character of the hydrogeology of this area the major aquifers satisfy the water demand of mountain districts and most apuo versilian coastal plain especially during the summer period when water consumptions increase due to the massive presence of tourists nevertheless the apuan alps aquifers may be particularly sensitive to contamination on one side the quarry activities for marble extraction e g the famous carrara marble worldwide produce quarry slurries mostly sand and silt cortopassi et al 2008 which can increase water turbidity drysdale et al 2001 piccini et al 2019 on the other the presence of several abandoned mines can represent a serious risk for water quality in this regard the southern sector of the apuan chain is characterized by the occurrence of sulfide ore deposits lattanzi et al 1994 mined until the early 90 s of the last century e g the valdicastello c mining area following the mines closure the oxidation of thallium rich pyrite d orazio et al 2017 and other polymetallic sulfides and sulfosalts carmignani et al 1975 1976 biagioni et al 2013 promoted the production of acid mine drainages releasing thallium tl and many other pte into the surface waters of the baccatoio stream perotti et al 2017 the instance roused a considerable political and health concern when tl was also found in the most important spring of the basin named molini di s anna that supplied the local network of drinking water perotti et al 2017 ghezzi et al 2019 consequently high tl concentration was detected in the aqueduct of valdicastello c biagioni et al 2017 and the urine and hair of people living in this area campanella et al 2016 it is worth noting that tl is a highly toxic element to humans and many other living organisms osorio rico et al 2017 however whereas countries like usa and china set a maximum concentration level in drinking water respectively of 2 µg l and 0 5 µg l tl is not yet regulated in italy as well as in europe so promoting a strong political legal and health debate on this particular issue campanella et al 2019 in this framework this work aims to investigate the moresco springs system composed by three springs named moresco alta moresco sondaggio and moresco galleria hereafter vsmoa vsmos and vsmog located in the lower sector of the baccatoio stream basin these springs might represent an important source for water supply due to their significant water productivity nonetheless only the vsmog feeds the local aqueduct because the others occasionally show increases of turbidity and tl contents unsuitable for drinking giannecchini et al 2016 natali et al 2019 and nigro et al 2020 showed preliminary results of multidisciplinary research on the moresco system highlighting the vulnerability of the springs but recognizing some differences among them through an integrated approach based on hydrodynamics hydrochemistry and water isotopes this study aims to define the origin and hydrochemical evolution of groundwater and to characterize the different flow paths feeding the moresco springs important issues about the origin of groundwater and their possible interactions with sources of pte have been faced the usefulness of an integrated approach for investigating complex carbonate systems is also emphasized 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the study area is within the catchment of the baccatoio stream which is a small watercourse flowing for 11 km from the southern sector of the apuan alps northwestern tuscany to the ligurian sea and crossing the coastal plain near pietrasanta town in the versilia region fig 1 a a well known seaside tourism area the drainage basin is a ne sw narrow and steep valley with altitudes ranging from 1108 m a s l gabberi mt to 80 m a s l at valdicastello c village the stream is characterized by extreme variability in flow regimes and gets some tributaries and spring waters from its catchment area besides the stream receives some acid drainages from the abandoned tunnels of mt arsiccio and pollone mines whose flow rates depend on the amount of precipitation perotti et al 2017 fig 1a the outcropping rocks in this area belong to several tectonic stratigraphic units involved in the northern apennine orogeny carmignani and kligfield 1990 molli and meccheri 2012 and reference therein fig 1a the apuan unit and the massa unit represent the base of the succession and are superimposed by the tuscan nappe ligurian units and neogene to quaternary sediments carmignani et al 1978 in the upstream zone of the basin a small tectonic window exposes the paleozoic basement phyllites quartzites and metarhyolites and carbonate lithotypes of the apuan unit mainly represented by metadolostones grezzoni fm and marbles marmi fm these lithotypes host several stratiform and lens shaped orebodies mostly composed of baryte pyrite iron oxides pb zn ag and widespread at the contact between basement rocks and metadolostones carmignani et al 1976 this mineralization was exploited until the 90 of the last century in several mines now abandoned fig 1a tl rich nature of pyrite up to 600 mg kg was recognized only recently and tl sulfosalts and tl rich varieties of pb as sb cu sulphides and sulfosalts were also discovered orlandi et al 2012 biagioni et al 2013 d orazio et al 2017 the outcropping rocks belonging to tuscan nappe are mostly represented by carbonate cataclasites and tectonic breccias calcare cavernoso and brecce poligeniche fms in fig 1a showing a typical vacuolate texture this inhomogeneous formation also including terms of the triassic evaporitic dolomitic sequence anhydrite gypsum and dolomitic breccia is generally known as calcare cavernoso fm carmignani and kligfield 1990 buchignani et al 2008 the carbonate lithotypes belonging to the apuan unit marbles and grezzoni and tuscan nappe host the most important aquifer systems of the area doveri et al 2019a ghezzi et al 2019 the high infiltration rates characterizing these rocks due to karstified fractures and cavities and the annual rainfall exceeding 2000 mm year giannecchini 2006 giannecchini and d amato avanzi 2012 result in a significant groundwater flow that feeds several springs piccini et al 1999 doveri et al 2019a some of these springs show flow rate over tens of l s and are tapped for drinkable water but are also highly vulnerable to contamination ghezzi et al 2019 the recent study of doveri et al 2019a deeply argued the karst character of these aquifers in which groundwater mostly flows with short transit time within well developed conduit networks hence the aquifers have high hydraulic conductivity and a weak storage capacity for supplying the base flow thus leading to early breakthrough of low flow at springs following the wet season november april superficial fracturing linked to tectonization unloading and physical chemical and mechanical processes is responsible for high rates of rainfall infiltration and can emphasize the transfer of streamwater to groundwater moresco springs drain the hydrogeologic carbonate complex of calcare cavernoso fm and along with tre fontane spring hereafter vstrf represent the most important outflows of this aquifer in terms of water discharge giannecchini et al 2016 the moresco springs are located on the left side of the baccatoio stream in the village of valdicastello c very close to the stream bed and each other fig 1a b on the other side of the stream the vstrf emerges the vsmoa emerges at the contact between carbonate aquifer and the underlying impervious basement constituted by phyllite and quartzite and it discharges directly into the stream fig 1c whereas the vsmos and vsmog are artificial springs the first one is derived from a sub horizontal drainage pipe drilled at the end of the tunnel thus discharging the groundwater directly outside into the stream fig 1d the second one collects 13 different small seepages captured with a tunnel over 30 m long which runs along the tectonic carbonate phyllite contact fig 1e as above mentioned among these springs only the vsmog is at present used to feed the valdicastello pietrasanta aqueduct whereas the others discharge into the environment because of water turbidity and quality issues natali et al 2019 3 methods and materials the survey was carried out from september 2017 to december 2018 by providing continuative monitoring of hydrologic physical chemical parameters physical chemical and flow rate periodical measurements water sampling and analysis of chemical compounds and water isotope signatures table 1 a more detailed description is given below 3 1 field measurements and sample collection in order to define the hydrodynamic features of the aquifer automatic probes diver ctd and diver baro schlumberger water services were placed both at the vsmoa vsmos and baccatoio stream in december 2017 the probes measure ec µs cm at 25 c t c and hydraulic head in terms of water pressure cm h2o at 15 minute intervals these probes had an accuracy of 1 for ec and 0 1 c for t while the accuracies of their pressure sensors were different 0 5 cmh2o for the model placed in the stream 2 5 cmh2o for those at the springs the vsmoa water level was also measured by an ultrasonic sensor prosonic s fdu91 endress hauser with an accuracy of about 0 2 cmh2o the water pressure measurements were compensated for atmospheric pressure by using readings from diver baro the vsmoa flow rate l s was calculated using a rectangular weir by the equation q 0 415 l h 2 gh where 0 415 is the discharge coefficient l m is the weir width h m is the hydraulic head and g is the gravitational acceleration the vsmos flow rate was also obtained using an ultrasonic flow meter clamp on type isoil industria s p a with minimum precision of 3 of the measured value t c ec µs cm at 20 c and ph of the vsmog were monitored at 3 minute intervals by a conductive probe 3400 sc and a digital differential probe hach lange gmbh respectively the accuracy was 1 of readings for ec and 0 02 for ph the measured ec values at this spring were reported to the standard temperature of 25 c using the linear equation proposed in sorensen and glass 1987 unfortunately the vsmog flow rate is not currently available due to technical issues nevertheless this spring showed a weakly variable flow rate estimable in 10 12 l s nine sampling campaigns were carried out at the three moresco springs and the baccatoio stream vtmor moreover some samples were also collected at the vstrf and the porta spring for comparison with the moresco springs the porta spring is a ca so4 spring located a few kilometers north of the baccatoio stream basin menichini et al 2016 samples were collected in double sealing hdpe bottles to avoid modification of the physical chemical characteristics of water aliquots for major cations and trace elements analyses were filtered through 0 45 µm nylon filters and acidified using ultrapure hno3 to ph lower than 2 0 conversely samples for major anions and isotopes analysis were collected unfiltered and not acidified water temperature t c ph and electrical conductivity ec µs cm at 25 c were measured on the field with portable waterproof instruments xs instruments alkalinity totally attributable to hco3 given the ph values was also determined in situ by acidimetric titration with 0 1 n hcl using methyl orange as an indicator during each sampling campaign flow rate measurements of the baccatoio stream were carried out by the salt dilution method østrem 1964 moore 2004 or using a current flow profiler aquaprofilertm depending on the local hydrologic conditions 3 2 isotopic methods the so called small springs method mussi et al 1998 doveri et al 2013 doveri and mussi 2014 vespasiano et al 2015 was applied to characterize the isotopic signal of infiltration waters in the basin and reconstruct the vertical isotopic gradient of the area the method represents a viable alternative to the complex and time consuming procedure to sample precipitation directly longinelli and selmo 2003 paternoster et al 2008 liotta et al 2013 furthermore the suitability of the low yield springs for such aims was demonstrated by a recent study carried out in the northern apennines tazioli et al 2019 therefore four low yield springs named vsdad vscrp vssen and vsfsa fig 1a placed at different altitudes from 160 to 771 m a s l and fed by small and inferable watersheds were identified and periodically sampled in this way the measured isotopic contents at the springs can be attributed to mean infiltration altitudes that are only slightly higher than the spring altitudes and inferable by morphological and hydrogeological considerations the flow rates and physical chemical parameters t ph ec were measured on site however rainwater was also collected monthly by a rain gauge placed at about 660 m a s l sant anna di stazzema village fig 1a and isotope analysis was performed following the prescriptions as specified by iaea gnip 2014 the rain collector is designed to minimize the evaporation of the collected water by using the anti evaporation system recommended in gröning et al 2012 3 3 laboratory analysis major anions were determined by ion chromatography ic using a metrohm 883 basic ic plus major cations concentrations were obtained by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes using a perkinelmer optima 2000tm dv in every case the relative standard deviation rsd calculated on three replicate injections was 5 the charge balance error was used to ensure the accuracy of the analysis for major elements appelo and postma 2005 and it was 10 for each sample trace elements li be mn co ni cu zn mo ag sn cd sb ba tl pb th u v cr fe as se were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms using a perkinelmer nexion 300x 103rh 187re and 209bi were used as internal standards to correct for signal fluctuations and matrix effects the analytical uncertainties relative to the determination of trace elements concentrations were evaluated through replicate analyses n 5 of the certified reference solution iv stock 1643 inorganic ventures the accuracy was generally 10 and the precision within 5 rsd except for zn 10 20 rsd the detection limits d l for each trace element were assessed as the mean value of the blank solution concentration ten replicates plus three times the standard deviation the water isotopic ratio 18o 16o was determined through mass spectrometer analysis using a europa scientific geo 20

based on off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy technique lis et al 2008 the o h isotope data are expressed as δ compared to the international reference standard v smow craig 1961 the analytical precision was 0 1 and 1 for δ18o and δ2h respectively trace chemical compounds were analyzed at the earth science department of the university of pisa whereas the analyses of major chemical elements and isotopes abundance were performed at the institute of geosciences and earth resources pisa of the national research council of italy 4 results 4 1 hydrodynamic conditions of springs and stream water the time series of daily mean flow rate water level ec and t of the moresco springs and baccatoio stream are given in fig 2 as shown in fig 2a the vsmoa displayed a typical karst flow regime characterized by sharp increases of water flow with very short response time after heavy rainfall events the discharge peaks occurred after a few hours from the meteoric events with increases of daily flow rate exceeding the base flow by even 100 and returning to the flow initial conditions with relatively longer times following the daily rainfall regime the vsmoa flow rate ranged from about 1 9 l s in december 2017 to about 100 l s both in december 2017 and april 2018 in the period between december 2017 and february 2018 the spring showed strong fluctuations from base flow values of about 20 25 l s to maximum values ranging between 60 and 80 l s in response to heavy rainstorms from march 2018 the vsmoa flow rate reached significantly higher values between 50 and 100 l s albeit with a certain variability due to the high and persistent rainfall occurring during this month the water flow gradually decreased from the beginning of april 2018 because of a long period of low precipitation amounts the outflow of the vsmos spring was instead substantially constant from 21 6 to 25 8 l s through the monitored period even though such behavior is very likely tied to the technical arrangement of the tap system indeed the low variability of discharge may depend on different factors including the limited diameter of the draining pipe 15 cm and the development of the tap system deeply in the saturated zone of the aquifer however very low increases in flow rate occurred after intense rainfall events even though they were negligible with respect to the vsmoa behavior the increase of the baccatoio stream water level systematically anticipated the flow rate peaks of the vsmoa by a few hours congruently with the regime of the water level the measured stream flow rate ranged from about 7 l s in september 2018 to about 157 l s in april 2018 table 2 the vsmoa and vsmos showed very similar ec values ranging from 454 to 573 μs cm mean of 510 μs cm fig 2b the baccatoio stream exhibited larger ec variations depending on the season and the hydrologic conditions with values covering the range 242 889 μs cm mean of 518 μs cm heavy rainstorm events resulted in sharp ec decreases at vsmoa and vsmos which occurred almost simultaneously to the stream water dilution albeit with a very lower variation rate starting from april may 2018 and continuing over the dry season the ec of these springs gradually raised to higher values in concomitance with flow rate decreases it is interesting to note the behavior of the stream during intense precipitation events following relatively long dry period sudden ec increases to values much higher than those typical of the base flow were registered and only afterwards ec gradually decreases up to pre event values the ec of the vsmog was instead between 685 and 835 µs cm mean of 751 µs cm significantly higher than vsmoa and vsmos ec appeared to be more stable in the short term even if the daily fluctuations probably due to instrumental issues make signal reading difficult however weak dilutions occurred after intense rainfall and a stronger one was registered from february march to april 2018 following a continuative intense rainy period an increasing ec trend started from may 2018 and persisted until the end of the study period the t of stream water was largely variable fig 2c depending on daily and seasonal changes of atmospheric temperature ranging from 4 3 to 25 4 c the vsmoa and vsmos displayed an identical pattern overlapping curves characterized by slight t decreases after heavy rainstorms and an increasing trend starting from april 2018 until the end of the dry season fig 2c the t at these springs was between 13 0 and 15 0 c mean of 14 1 0 6 c as for the ec the t of vsmog was significantly higher and more stable than the other springs with values ranging from 15 3 to 16 2 c mean of 15 8 0 2 c 4 2 hydrochemistry and water quality the field and major chemical elements data are reported in table 2 the moresco springs showed similar and slightly variable ph values ranging from a minimum of 6 99 vsmog to a maximum of 7 67 vsmoa hydrogen ion concentration was more variable at the baccatoio stream and vstrf with a ph ranging from 7 32 to 8 29 and from 7 40 to 8 36 respectively indicating neutral to slightly alkaline conditions ec and t data during each sampling field were in accordance with the results from continuous monitoring even if only one sample was collected at the porta spring it showed the highest temperature among the studied springs with a value of 16 9 c in agreement with menichini et al 2016 vstrf and porta spring represented the two extremes for ec with values of 425 mean value and 889 µs cm respectively ca2 and hco3 were the main elements of the groundwater samples excepting the porta spring with so4 2 hco3 the major element values of the moresco springs and baccatoio stream were in compliance with the limits for drinkable waters set by italian legislative decree 31 2001 d lgs 31 2001 whereas the porta spring sample exceeded the so4 2 limit chemical data are plotted in the piper trilinear diagram which provides a tool for classifying water types as shown in fig 3 a three main hydrochemical facies are recognized i ca hco3 vstrf vsmoa and vsmos ii ca so4 hco3 vsmog iii ca so4 porta spring and baccatoio stream moresco springs and baccatoio stream showed a relative chemical composition variability suggesting mixing processes between ca hco3 water e g vstrf and ca so4 water porta spring and some samples of the baccatoio stream this variability is mainly due to the so4 concentration which covered the ranges 121 192 mg l 36 92 mg l 93 234 mg l at vsmog vsmoa s and vtmor respectively table 2 fig 3b the baccatoio stream exhibited a higher mg ca ratio in comparison with the springs congruently to ec the total ionic salinity tis of the vsmog was higher than vsmoa and vsmos fig 3b as a whole the samples may be grouped into four classes 1 7 tis 12 meq l with hco3 so4 2 vstrf vsmoa vsmos 2 7 tis 14 meq l with so4 2 hco3 vtmor 3 12 tis 16 meq l with so4 2 and hco3 abundances very similar to each other vsmog 4 tis 18 meq l with so4 2 hco3 porta spring the trace elements data of sampled waters are reported in table 3 all the samples showed pte concentration lower than the italian thresholds for drinkable water except for mn in vtmor in december 2018 85 3 µg l nonetheless the vtmor and one sample of the vsmoa vsmos september 2017 exceeded the tl maximum allowable concentration of 2 µg l for drinking water mcl maximum contaminant level set by environmental protection agency us epa particularly tl concentration was in the ranges 0 70 2 26 µg l at vsmoa s and 9 50 15 1 µg l at vtmor on the contrary the vsmog the only one that feeds the aqueduct showed tl content significantly lower than 2 µg l mean of 0 1 µg l similarly to vstrf 0 1 µg l and porta spring 0 2 µg l as shown in the schoeller berkaloff diagram of fig 4 a the pte usually associated with the mineralization of the baccatoio stream basin cu cd mn pb sb tl zn d orazio et al 2017 were significantly higher at vtmor vsmoa and vsmos than vsmog and vstrf conversely the vsmog was characterized by large amounts of sr mean value of 954 µg l that was about one order of magnitude higher than the other springs except for the porta spring that showed the highest concentration 2235 µg l overall the higher pte contents were detected during the dry season whereas the abundant winter spring rains caused dilution effects lowering the pte concentrations this effect also found by qin et al 2019 in a karst reservoir of southwestern china is particularly evident in fig 4b where it is observed that tl is inversely correlated with the rainfall amount similarly to the molini di sant anna spring in the upper sector of the basin ghezzi et al 2019 specifically vtmor vsmoa and vsmos underwent lowering tl concentrations during high precipitation periods late winter spring season whereas they showed higher concentration during low rainfall periods december 2017 and august 2018 the similar evolution of tl in the not captured springs and stream waters vtmor is to be emphasized fig 4b 4 3 isotopic composition of waters the o h isotope data of water samples are reported in table 4 according to doveri et al 2019b precipitation collected in the baccatoio catchment at 660 m a s l showed large isotopic fluctuations fig 5 a from 8 98 to 3 41 and from 57 9 to 19 5 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the amount weighted average isotopic composition of rain was 6 40 for δ18o and 37 8 for δ2h the stream and spring samples overlapped the local meteoric water line lmwl obtained by doveri et al 2019b blue straight line in fig 5a and the italian meteoric water line imwl giustini et al 2016 indicating a meteoric origin of the sampled groundwater and surface water as shown in fig 5a the moresco springs and baccatoio stream covered a range of values much narrower than for the precipitation and they showed an o h isotopic composition slightly enriched in heavy isotopes compared to the amount weighted average isotopic composition of rainfall the isotopic composition of the vsmog was substantially constant through the survey period fig 6 ranging from 6 26 to 6 10 for δ18o mean value of 6 14 0 05 and from 37 6 to 35 7 for δ2h mean of 36 9 0 7 on the contrary the vsmoa and vsmos showed very similar fluctuations of the isotopic signals as a whole from 6 26 to 5 94 mean of 6 13 0 10 and from 37 6 to 34 5 mean of 36 3 1 0 for δ18o and δ2h respectively likely reflecting the seasonal variability typical of precipitations similar behavior was observed for the baccatoio stream whose δ18o and δ2h values were in the ranges 6 24 6 03 mean of 6 16 0 07 and 36 7 34 2 mean of 35 8 0 9 respectively the enrichment in heavy isotopes occurred during the rainy periods february and april 2018 followed by a depletion during the dry season the physical chemical and isotopic data of the four small springs sampled vsdad vscrp vssen vsfsa are given in table 5 as shown in fig 5b the samples overlapped the lmwl and imwl and covered a range narrower than precipitation the range of values observed for δ18o and δ2h was mainly linked to the altitude effect the o h isotopic composition was relatively stable for vsdad and vscrp whereas vssen and vsfsa showed significant variability for this reason a flow rate weighted isotopic value for each spring was computed as outlined by mcdonnell et al 1990 furthermore the vssen exhibited δ18o and δ2h values inconsistent with its altitude compared to the pattern shown by the other springs fig 7 probably for peculiar hydrodynamic conditions to be better investigate therefore this spring was excluded in the method the regression lines for δ18o and δ2h were achieved by means of comparison among the flow rate weighted average isotopic composition of the accounted springs and the respective inferred infiltration average altitudes fig 7 the regression lines equations were altitude m 912 δ18o 5181 r2 0 999 for δ18o and altitude m 153 δ2h 5167 r2 0 955 for δ2h the former was used to assess the feeding average altitude of the moresco springs since the lower analytical uncertainty anyway the same result may be expected by using the regression line for δ2h the δ18o vertical isotopic gradient was about 0 11 every 100 m of increasing altitude such value was slightly lower than those previously observed in the apuan alps area mussi et al 1998 doveri et al 2013 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater flow systems and stream features the vsmoa and vsmos are recognized as the expression of the same groundwater flow system as indicated by the over time evolution of ec and t and by similar chemical and isotopic data figs 2 3 6 the high discharge peaks of the vsmoa following plentiful precipitation even of 300 400 larger than baseflow and fast returning to the initial flow conditions denote the karst behavior with an elevated transmissivity of the feeding system the residual flow rate that lasts after high discharge peaks is very small compared to the peak values and tends to be fast consumed indicating a reduced storage capacity of the aquifer these hydrodynamic characteristics suggest a prevalence of large fractures in the aquifer in which waters flow with very high velocity conversely the role of a less permeable fracturing system appears to be secondary the variation of the isotopic signals for the vsmoa vsmos system although limited is consistent with this frame the medium term evolution of t from about 13 0 to 15 0 c shown by the vsmoa and vsmos likely indicates a sensitivity to the atmospheric t fig 2c suggesting the presence of at least one shallow flow component such a scheme agrees with the slight isotopic evolution over time fig 8 showing depletion in heavy isotopes during the dry season simultaneously to ec and t increase this pattern points out a significant influence of rainfall probably not directly but very likely through the baccatoio stream which has the same isotopic evolution of the springs fig 8 according to doveri et al 2019b the narrow range of the isotopic composition covered by the baccatoio stream fig 6 indicates that the stream baseflow is mostly represented by the groundwater discharge occurring in the medium high section of the catchment this limits the usefulness of stable water isotopes to highlight the existence of infiltration from the baccatoio stream towards the moresco springs especially with the sampling frequency adopted in this study furthermore respect to other karst aquifers of the apuan alps doveri et al 2019a the vsmoa vsmos system showed a very narrow range of the o h isotopic signature despite the wide isotopic interval registered at the s anna di stazzema rain gauge fig 5a similar behavior was observed in other karst systems worldwide lópez chicano et al 2001 mudarra and andreo 2011 gil márquez et al 2019 and it could be indicative of a dominant piston flow effect pushing old water through the aquifer before the outflow at springs these water mix with the stream water that seems to be the main responsible of the weak isotopic variation at vsmoa and vsmos in any case the involvment of the stream water in the mixing appear to be secondary as suggested by the small ec decreases at springs although the high ec variability of the baccatoio stream as highlighted by the time series of fig 2b and c the vsmog significantly differs from the vsmoa and vsmos considering the average annual values of atmospheric t in the area and the relationship between altitude and mean t for the major springs of the apuan alps piccini et al 1999 doveri et al 2019b the mean value of 15 8 c of the vsmog indicates a groundwater flow path deep enough to be affected by the normal geothermal gradient of the area molli et al 2015 according to the higher ec and its lower variability in the short term the tapped spring drains groundwater characterized by a greater degree of maturity likely linked to a wider and deeper flow system and longer water rock interaction processes the almost constant o h isotopic composition of the vsmog reflects groundwater residence times long enough to completely obliterate the seasonal variability of the rainfall δ18o and δ2h fig 6 this agrees with the aforementioned hypothesis about the flow path scheme which suggests favourable natural conditions for groundwater protection from contamination events the sharp increases in the water level of the baccatoio stream displayed in fig 2a as well as the high flow rates reached after heavy rainfall are typical of torrential regimes the ec evolution occurring in the stream fig 2b may be caused by both the direct rainfall and water coming from springs tributaries and mine drainages perotti et al 2017 while the dilution effects due to rainfall are evident in the wet season they seem to be masked by the contribution of the high ec acid drainages during the low precipitation periods resulting in two different patterns over the year such behavior is likely steered by the different ratios of quantity between runoff and mine drainage components depending on the hydrologic regime it may not be excluded that remobilization processes of mine linked compounds precipitated in the dry periods occur during storm events thus contributing to the stream ec increases 5 2 hydrochemical processes and relationship among water sources as already stated in prior studies e g perotti et al 2017 the ca so4 hydrochemical facies of the baccatoio stream indicates a direct connection between the stream water and the acid mine drainages amd outflowing from mt arsiccio and pollone mines the occurrence of oxidation processes of sulfides mostly pyrite hosted in marbles metadolostones grezzoni fm and schists results in a release of mg so4 2 and various pte including tl to the mine drainages that feed the baccatoio stream as confirmed by the higher mg ca ratio of the stream compared to the moresco springs this effect becomes more negligible during the rainy season when dilution effects occur and the stream baseflow is mostly represented by the groundwater discharge doveri et al 2019b the hydrochemical composition of the moresco springs is typical of groundwater flow systems developed in carbonate aquifers locally represented by calcare cavernoso fm fig 1 according to formula 1 the dissolution of carbonate calcite and or dolomite which releases ca mg and hco3 into groundwater is the predominant process in the study area 1 c a x m g 1 x c o 3 2 2 c o 2 2 h 2 o x c a 2 1 x m g 2 4 h c o 3 the moresco springs are characterized by higher so4 contents than most carbonate springs of the apuan alps doveri et al 2019a and consequently by higher ec and tis values according to the geological mineralogical frame of the basin the high concentration of so4 especially in vsmog may be attributed to two major processes sulfide oxidation of mineralization mostly pyrite hosted in dolostones widespread in the upstream sector of the basin 2 dissolution of gypsum anhydrite that may be present in the deepest portions of calcare cavernoso fm 3 i e buchignani et al 2008 boschetti et al 2011 doveri et al 2015 2019a 2 4 f e s 2 15 o 2 14 h 2 o 4 f e oh 3 8 s o 4 2 16 h 3 cas o 4 2 h 2 o c a 2 s o 4 2 2 h 2 o as shown in the binary diagram of ca mg vs hco3 so4 fig 9 a the groundwater and stream samples are displayed along the 1 1 line highlighting that the dissolution of calcite dolomite likely associated sulfide oxidation and gypsum are the predominant reactions in the groundwater system nonetheless the vsmog differs from the other samples except for vtmor in september 2017 by the higher concentration of these chemical species along with the porta spring that represents an evaporitic member menichini et al 2016 as stated by barbieri et al 2005 for some karst springs in central italy the higher content of solutes indicates a more intense water rock interaction reflecting longer residence times and or deeper flow systems recently de la torre et al 2020 ascribed the gradual increase of t and mineralization values from high altitude springs to low altitude ones to the existence of longer and deeper flowpaths differences between springs can be better evidenced by the binary diagram of mg ca molar ratio vs so4 fig 9b in which two main different water types are observed the first one is characterized by a narrow mg ca range a large interval of so4 concentration and a rough alignment of the vsmog points towards the porta spring this suggests that the gypsum anhydrite dissolution is likely the main source of so4 for vsmog as occurs in other systems made up by the lower part of mesozoic carbonates e g mudarra and andreo 2011 such a hypothesis is congruent with the wider and deeper flow component feeding the vsmog as also suggested by the high sr concentration fig 9c sr is generally present in carbonate and sulphate minerals as vicarious for ca faure 1997 and is typically associated with longer and deeper groundwater flow paths indeed under these conditions the protracted water rock interactions inducing by longer residence time promote the increasing of sr ca ratio in waters as shown in fig 9c the increasing sr concentration corresponds to a rise of so4 in the vsmog and once more it determines an alignment of vsmog points towards the porta spring sample this is congruent with the evaporitic dissolution as a major process in the aquifer feeding the vsmog releasing significant quantities of so4 and sr at the same time the presence of a weak variability of the vsmog chemistry figs 3 and 4b points out a mixing process between a so4 more enriched component and a hco3 more enriched component the latter seems to be similar to the vstrf water toward which the less concentrated vsmog samples move fig 9b c hence a certain lithological heterogeneity of the reservoir may be supposed congruently with the calcare cavernoso fm features in which the prevalent limestone dolostone lithology may result interbedded to gypsum anhydrite layers especially at depth the isotopic stability of the vsmog supports this hypothesis rather than the existence of two different and separated feeding components that unlikely would have the identical isotopic signature resulting in the same recharge mean altitude however mixing between two components hosted in independent reservoirs may not be completely excluded the second group of water in fig 9b is represented by the moresco not captured springs baccatoio stream vtmor and vstrf as displayed in the diagram the vsmoa and vsmos points are lined up between the carbonate end member represented by the vstrf and the ca so4 composition of the vtmor suggesting a possible mixing between the two components in this case the so4 increasing corresponds to a significant rise of mg ca ratio congruently to dolomite dissolution and sulfide oxidation ghezzi et al 2019 as already suggested by natali et al 2019 and nigro et al 2020 this arrangement of the vsmoa and vsmos samples indicates the likely mixing between the stream waters and ca carbonate waters represented by the vstrf pointing out the existence of a hydraulic connection between the baccatoio stream and the vsmoa vsmos system this process is also well highlighted by the comparison of these springs and the stream in terms of evolution of the tl and so4 content over time fig 4b furthermore the binary diagram of fig 9d shows the rough positive correlation between tl and so4 in vsmoa vsmos and vtmor whereas vsmog exhibits constant and very low tl contents with respect to so4 variability the likely mixing among springs and stream waters is also in agreement with the sr vs so4 binary diagram of fig 9c where the not captured springs are once more lined up between vstrf and stream the inverse correlation between tl and rainfall amount fig 4b also highlights that the contribution of tl contaminated end member i e baccatoio stream is weakened in the mixing during the rainy periods late autumn winter early spring this evidence may be tied to the ca carbonate waters of the aquifer which likely provide the bulk of the supply during the wet season even if the dilution of the stream water can promote the observed evolution at the springs actually both the tl contaminated and ca carbonate components increase in quantity during the wet period despite the second component becomes more important in percentage such a process is well pointed out in fig 10 where increasing the vsmoa flow rate the tl concentration decreases but the tl flux increases as already observed by ghezzi et al 2019 in the near molini di sant anna spring by applying the equation 4 of the two components mixing for all the collected samples an interval of 6 10 of stream component is achieved corresponding to a flow rate ranging from about 1 8 6 7 l s with respect to a total spring discharge from about 28 l s to 88 l s 4 t l s smix tl a amix tl tot where tl s tl concentration in the baccatoio stream tl a tl concentration in the vstrf representative of the ca hco3 component of the aquifer tl tot total tl concentration in the vsmoa vsmos springs smix percentage of the stream component in the mixing amix percentage of the ca hco3 component vstrf of the aquifer in the mixing the low concentration of pte especially tl in the vsmog confirms the absence of a hydraulic connection between this spring and the stream consistently with the deeper water circulation that is less sensitive to changes occurring at ground level in the short medium term excluding the sample collected in december 2017 representative of a peculiar lean flow period as the rainy season progressed the dilution of the sulfate component only gradually occurs and with a delay compared to the more rapid response of the not captured springs fig 4b such behavior consequently results in a gradual ec decrease from february to april 2018 fig 2b this inertia and gradual character of the physical chemical evolution lead us to hypothesize that both the flow components involved in the vsmog groundwater system have relatively long and deep circulation developed in medium permeable fracturing systems 5 3 main recharge areas identification through small spring method all the results hitherto discussed indicate the presence of two main groundwater flow systems drained by the vsmog and the ensemble vsmoa vsmos respectively the former system appears to be protected from contaminated waters infiltrating through the streambed unlike the latter which is clearly influenced by the baccatoio stream moreover the transfer of pte towards groundwater systems may occur by diffuse infiltration in areas encompassing mine structures e g tunnels pits rather than through the aforementioned infiltration processes in these terms the evaluation of the main recharge areas of the springs assumes crucial importance for this purpose the water isotope signatures can give significant information the heavy isotopes enrichment shown by the moresco springs respect to the weighted mean isotopic composition of precipitation fig 5a preliminarily indicates a mean recharge altitude lower than 660 m a s l s anna di stazzema rain gauge by comparing the δ18o values of the moresco springs with the regression line altitude δ18o fig 7a a very similar recharge average altitude was assessed for the two moresco groundwater systems ranging from about 350 m to 450 m a s l fig 11 considering the weak but significant variability of the isotopic composition of vsmoa and vsmos a volume weighted mean δ18o of 6 10 was compared with the regression line altitude δ18o on the other hand given the relatively constant flow rate of the vsmog the arithmetic mean values of 6 14 0 05 was used even if the vsmog showed lower isotopic values corresponding to mean altitudes recharge slightly higher for both systems the main feeding areas occur in the low medium portion of the mountain sector of the baccatoio catchment in this sector the pollone mining district develops thus representing a potential source of pte not only by surface acid drainages but also via direct underground transfer 5 4 environmental implications the experimental data demonstrate the good protection of the groundwater system feeding the tapped spring vsmog thus making the spring a real safe source for drinking water distribution on the other hand the detailed understanding of transfer mechanisms of pte towards the not tapped springs vsmoa vsmos excludes at present the possibility of exploitation of this groundwater resource such as vulnerability to contamination by thallium and other pte is enhanced by the particular hydrogeological conditions of the karst environment the hydraulic connectivity with the surface especially in the epiphreatic zone promotes the circulation of oxygenated water which represents the fuel for oxidation processes of sulfides hosted in limestones ghezzi et al 2019 a safe use of this resource would at least require specific actions aimed to avoid the hydraulic connection between the contaminated stream and the aquifer in a more general context ensuring the protection of surface water and groundwater in this specific area would need remediation actions of acid drainages flowing out the mine tunnels however a specific monitoring program can be helpful to local water administrator to mitigate contamination issues 6 conclusions the multi tool survey carried out in a past mining area has highlighted the importance of integrated approaches to understand the groundwater flows in complex carbonate aquifers threatened by anthropic activities in the case study here presented the adopted approach allowed to reach a good understanding of the groundwater systems investigated with particular regard to the possible mechanisms of their interaction with sources of pte the main results well evidence the presence of two distinct separated systems feeding springs very close to each others thus confirming the complexity of the groundwater flow paths arrangement within carbonate aquifers this complexity reflects on the challenging management of karst groundwater resources made possible only by the integration of different techniques and methods for this purpose an integrated approach based on hydrodynamics hydrochemistry and stable water isotopes prove to be useful in similar environments worldwide for policymakers thus the reliable management of water resources and the appropriate allocation of waters with different degrees of quality are correctly steered indeed ensuring water safety and security is one of the main challenges worldwide especially in areas deeply impacted by human activities concerning the environmental issue tied to thallium contamination this study represents one of first attempts to investigate the origin of this element in carbonate groundwater to the best knowledge of the authors only a few studies were carried out to this end both in italy and worldwide xiao et al 2003 ghezzi et al 2019 since thallium was considered uncommon in natural waters until recent years belzile and chen 2017 in this regard the approach here adopted may represent a valid method when facing environmental issues tied to emerging contaminants in carbonate aquifers funding this research received public funding from gaia spa which provides the local integrated water service credit authorship contribution statement m

4945,carbonate aquifers represent an essential source of water supply worldwide although they generally have a high intrinsic vulnerability this results in an elevated risk of groundwater contamination and for human health in case of hazardous anthropic activities such as mining hence for addressing the pollution issues of these strategic groundwater resources and planning their optimal management as well detailed surveys based on a comprehensive approach are required this work concerns the issues tied to the coexistence of abandoned mining activities and valuable groundwater it provides the case of a past mining district on the apuan alps northwestern tuscany italy where the local carbonate aquifers host abundant groundwater resources threatened by acid mine drainages and thallium contaminated surface waters the research focuses on three important springs among which only one is tapped for drinking use the main goal was to investigate the origin and hydrochemical evolution of groundwater and to evaluate their possible interactions with sources of potentially toxic elements from september 2017 to december 2018 we performed nine sampling fields on contaminated stream and spring waters as well as chemical major and trace elements and isotopic analysis δ18o and δ2h in addition to continuative monitoring of hydrologic physical chemical parameters we also periodically sampled four low yield springs located in the studied catchment in order to characterize the isotopic signal of the infiltration water and identify the main recharge areas of groundwater systems we recognize two different groundwater flow systems feeding the main springs the first one drained by the two not tapped springs is shallower as evidenced by the over time evolution of water temperature electrical conductivity and isotopic signatures the tl concentration and its variability during the study period which follows the pattern showed by the stream indicates the likely hydraulic connectivity between the stream and these springs the second system feeding the captured spring is wider and deeper than the former and is characterized by longer residence times the higher temperature and electrical conductivity along with the constant o h isotopic composition support such a hypothesis the chemical evolution of the springs starts from a pure ca hco3 end member therefore evolving into two different chemical types on one side because of the hydraulic connection between the contaminated stream water and the shallower groundwater flow system significant concentrations so4 tl and other potentially toxic elements occur in the not tapped springs compromising their quality on the other hand the deepening of the flow component drained by the tapped ca so4 hco3 spring may lead to the dissolution of gypsum anhydrite layers thus producing water enriched in so4 and sr although tl and other potentially toxic elements present very low concentrations therefore the groundwater system feeding this spring appears to be protected from contamination events linked to the tl polluted stream water moreover we assessed a very similar recharge average altitude for the two groundwater flow systems ranging from about 350 m to 450 m a s l in this sector of the catchment some dismissed mines develop thus representing a potential source of potentially toxic elements not only through surface acid drainages but also via direct underground transfer the obtained results highlight the importance of an integrated approach for understanding in detail the groundwater dynamics in complex carbonate aquifers threatened by legacy mining keywords groundwater karst aquifers drinkable spring water acid mine drainages thallium apuan alps 1 introduction groundwater represents a vital natural resource and an essential part of the hydrologic cycle disregarding the large quantity stored in ice caps and glaciers 96 of all freshwater existing on the earth is stored

threatens the future availability of water resources kløve et al 2014 wwap 2019 hence the need to protect groundwater against contamination and quantity deterioration doveri et al 2015 hölting and coldewey 2019 especially in areas where anthropogenic pressures exist in many areas of the world carbonate aquifers especially karst aquifers hold significant groundwater resources that represent an essential source of water supply for entire regions and megacities bakalowicz 2005 ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 kalhor et al 2019 in europe water resources hosted in carbonate rocks satisfy approximately 50 of water demand for human consumption andreo et al 2008 despite the natural quality of these large underground reserves is often excellent doveri et al 2019a carbonate aquifers are particularly vulnerable to the contamination kazakis et al 2018 especially in areas affected by mining and quarrying activities zhang et al 2016 he et al 2019 piccini et al 2019 well developed fractures and conduits shaped by dissolution processes affect surface and sub surface drainage resulting in high flow velocity and short residence time marín and andreo 2015 doveri et al 2019a contaminants can quickly reach the groundwater and disperse over large distances jiménez madrid et al 2019 the strategic role of these aquifers is therefore threatened and often compromised by the release of toxic and potentially toxic elements pte to the environment in dismissed and abandoned mining sites nordstrom 2011 cidu et al 2009 ghezzi et al 2019 qin et al 2019 detailed investigations on dynamics and mechanisms regulating these systems are required to ensure preservation from pollution correct intended use and optimal management of water resources for this purpose here we present a case study from a past mining area in italy northwestern tuscany where a multi tool survey aimed to define the possible processes threatening spring water the apuan alps tuscany region italy represent one of the most important karst areas in italy and europe well known from a speleological point of view piccini 2013 hosting large quantities of groundwater resources within metamorphic and non metamorphic carbonate aquifer systems piccini et al 1999 doveri et al 2019a there are 260 caves with a length of more than 100 m whereas the overall cave system extends for over 325 km federazione speleologica toscana 2006 these data testify the exceptional development of karst conduits in the percolation vadose zone and emphasize the highly karstic character of the hydrogeology of this area the major aquifers satisfy the water demand of mountain districts and most apuo versilian coastal plain especially during the summer period when water consumptions increase due to the massive presence of tourists nevertheless the apuan alps aquifers may be particularly sensitive to contamination on one side the quarry activities for marble extraction e g the famous carrara marble worldwide produce quarry slurries mostly sand and silt cortopassi et al 2008 which can increase water turbidity drysdale et al 2001 piccini et al 2019 on the other the presence of several abandoned mines can represent a serious risk for water quality in this regard the southern sector of the apuan chain is characterized by the occurrence of sulfide ore deposits lattanzi et al 1994 mined until the early 90 s of the last century e g the valdicastello c mining area following the mines closure the oxidation of thallium rich pyrite d orazio et al 2017 and other polymetallic sulfides and sulfosalts carmignani et al 1975 1976 biagioni et al 2013 promoted the production of acid mine drainages releasing thallium tl and many other pte into the surface waters of the baccatoio stream perotti et al 2017 the instance roused a considerable political and health concern when tl was also found in the most important spring of the basin named molini di s anna that supplied the local network of drinking water perotti et al 2017 ghezzi et al 2019 consequently high tl concentration was detected in the aqueduct of valdicastello c biagioni et al 2017 and the urine and hair of people living in this area campanella et al 2016 it is worth noting that tl is a highly toxic element to humans and many other living organisms osorio rico et al 2017 however whereas countries like usa and china set a maximum concentration level in drinking water respectively of 2 µg l and 0 5 µg l tl is not yet regulated in italy as well as in europe so promoting a strong political legal and health debate on this particular issue campanella et al 2019 in this framework this work aims to investigate the moresco springs system composed by three springs named moresco alta moresco sondaggio and moresco galleria hereafter vsmoa vsmos and vsmog located in the lower sector of the baccatoio stream basin these springs might represent an important source for water supply due to their significant water productivity nonetheless only the vsmog feeds the local aqueduct because the others occasionally show increases of turbidity and tl contents unsuitable for drinking giannecchini et al 2016 natali et al 2019 and nigro et al 2020 showed preliminary results of multidisciplinary research on the moresco system highlighting the vulnerability of the springs but recognizing some differences among them through an integrated approach based on hydrodynamics hydrochemistry and water isotopes this study aims to define the origin and hydrochemical evolution of groundwater and to characterize the different flow paths feeding the moresco springs important issues about the origin of groundwater and their possible interactions with sources of pte have been faced the usefulness of an integrated approach for investigating complex carbonate systems is also emphasized 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the study area is within the catchment of the baccatoio stream which is a small watercourse flowing for 11 km from the southern sector of the apuan alps northwestern tuscany to the ligurian sea and crossing the coastal plain near pietrasanta town in the versilia region fig 1 a a well known seaside tourism area the drainage basin is a ne sw narrow and steep valley with altitudes ranging from 1108 m a s l gabberi mt to 80 m a s l at valdicastello c village the stream is characterized by extreme variability in flow regimes and gets some tributaries and spring waters from its catchment area besides the stream receives some acid drainages from the abandoned tunnels of mt arsiccio and pollone mines whose flow rates depend on the amount of precipitation perotti et al 2017 fig 1a the outcropping rocks in this area belong to several tectonic stratigraphic units involved in the northern apennine orogeny carmignani and kligfield 1990 molli and meccheri 2012 and reference therein fig 1a the apuan unit and the massa unit represent the base of the succession and are superimposed by the tuscan nappe ligurian units and neogene to quaternary sediments carmignani et al 1978 in the upstream zone of the basin a small tectonic window exposes the paleozoic basement phyllites quartzites and metarhyolites and carbonate lithotypes of the apuan unit mainly represented by metadolostones grezzoni fm and marbles marmi fm these lithotypes host several stratiform and lens shaped orebodies mostly composed of baryte pyrite iron oxides pb zn ag and widespread at the contact between basement rocks and metadolostones carmignani et al 1976 this mineralization was exploited until the 90 of the last century in several mines now abandoned fig 1a tl rich nature of pyrite up to 600 mg kg was recognized only recently and tl sulfosalts and tl rich varieties of pb as sb cu sulphides and sulfosalts were also discovered orlandi et al 2012 biagioni et al 2013 d orazio et al 2017 the outcropping rocks belonging to tuscan nappe are mostly represented by carbonate cataclasites and tectonic breccias calcare cavernoso and brecce poligeniche fms in fig 1a showing a typical vacuolate texture this inhomogeneous formation also including terms of the triassic evaporitic dolomitic sequence anhydrite gypsum and dolomitic breccia is generally known as calcare cavernoso fm carmignani and kligfield 1990 buchignani et al 2008 the carbonate lithotypes belonging to the apuan unit marbles and grezzoni and tuscan nappe host the most important aquifer systems of the area doveri et al 2019a ghezzi et al 2019 the high infiltration rates characterizing these rocks due to karstified fractures and cavities and the annual rainfall exceeding 2000 mm year giannecchini 2006 giannecchini and d amato avanzi 2012 result in a significant groundwater flow that feeds several springs piccini et al 1999 doveri et al 2019a some of these springs show flow rate over tens of l s and are tapped for drinkable water but are also highly vulnerable to contamination ghezzi et al 2019 the recent study of doveri et al 2019a deeply argued the karst character of these aquifers in which groundwater mostly flows with short transit time within well developed conduit networks hence the aquifers have high hydraulic conductivity and a weak storage capacity for supplying the base flow thus leading to early breakthrough of low flow at springs following the wet season november april superficial fracturing linked to tectonization unloading and physical chemical and mechanical processes is responsible for high rates of rainfall infiltration and can emphasize the transfer of streamwater to groundwater moresco springs drain the hydrogeologic carbonate complex of calcare cavernoso fm and along with tre fontane spring hereafter vstrf represent the most important outflows of this aquifer in terms of water discharge giannecchini et al 2016 the moresco springs are located on the left side of the baccatoio stream in the village of valdicastello c very close to the stream bed and each other fig 1a b on the other side of the stream the vstrf emerges the vsmoa emerges at the contact between carbonate aquifer and the underlying impervious basement constituted by phyllite and quartzite and it discharges directly into the stream fig 1c whereas the vsmos and vsmog are artificial springs the first one is derived from a sub horizontal drainage pipe drilled at the end of the tunnel thus discharging the groundwater directly outside into the stream fig 1d the second one collects 13 different small seepages captured with a tunnel over 30 m long which runs along the tectonic carbonate phyllite contact fig 1e as above mentioned among these springs only the vsmog is at present used to feed the valdicastello pietrasanta aqueduct whereas the others discharge into the environment because of water turbidity and quality issues natali et al 2019 3 methods and materials the survey was carried out from september 2017 to december 2018 by providing continuative monitoring of hydrologic physical chemical parameters physical chemical and flow rate periodical measurements water sampling and analysis of chemical compounds and water isotope signatures table 1 a more detailed description is given below 3 1 field measurements and sample collection in order to define the hydrodynamic features of the aquifer automatic probes diver ctd and diver baro schlumberger water services were placed both at the vsmoa vsmos and baccatoio stream in december 2017 the probes measure ec µs cm at 25 c t c and hydraulic head in terms of water pressure cm h2o at 15 minute intervals these probes had an accuracy of 1 for ec and 0 1 c for t while the accuracies of their pressure sensors were different 0 5 cmh2o for the model placed in the stream 2 5 cmh2o for those at the springs the vsmoa water level was also measured by an ultrasonic sensor prosonic s fdu91 endress hauser with an accuracy of about 0 2 cmh2o the water pressure measurements were compensated for atmospheric pressure by using readings from diver baro the vsmoa flow rate l s was calculated using a rectangular weir by the equation q 0 415 l h 2 gh where 0 415 is the discharge coefficient l m is the weir width h m is the hydraulic head and g is the gravitational acceleration the vsmos flow rate was also obtained using an ultrasonic flow meter clamp on type isoil industria s p a with minimum precision of 3 of the measured value t c ec µs cm at 20 c and ph of the vsmog were monitored at 3 minute intervals by a conductive probe 3400 sc and a digital differential probe hach lange gmbh respectively the accuracy was 1 of readings for ec and 0 02 for ph the measured ec values at this spring were reported to the standard temperature of 25 c using the linear equation proposed in sorensen and glass 1987 unfortunately the vsmog flow rate is not currently available due to technical issues nevertheless this spring showed a weakly variable flow rate estimable in 10 12 l s nine sampling campaigns were carried out at the three moresco springs and the baccatoio stream vtmor moreover some samples were also collected at the vstrf and the porta spring for comparison with the moresco springs the porta spring is a ca so4 spring located a few kilometers north of the baccatoio stream basin menichini et al 2016 samples were collected in double sealing hdpe bottles to avoid modification of the physical chemical characteristics of water aliquots for major cations and trace elements analyses were filtered through 0 45 µm nylon filters and acidified using ultrapure hno3 to ph lower than 2 0 conversely samples for major anions and isotopes analysis were collected unfiltered and not acidified water temperature t c ph and electrical conductivity ec µs cm at 25 c were measured on the field with portable waterproof instruments xs instruments alkalinity totally attributable to hco3 given the ph values was also determined in situ by acidimetric titration with 0 1 n hcl using methyl orange as an indicator during each sampling campaign flow rate measurements of the baccatoio stream were carried out by the salt dilution method østrem 1964 moore 2004 or using a current flow profiler aquaprofilertm depending on the local hydrologic conditions 3 2 isotopic methods the so called small springs method mussi et al 1998 doveri et al 2013 doveri and mussi 2014 vespasiano et al 2015 was applied to characterize the isotopic signal of infiltration waters in the basin and reconstruct the vertical isotopic gradient of the area the method represents a viable alternative to the complex and time consuming procedure to sample precipitation directly longinelli and selmo 2003 paternoster et al 2008 liotta et al 2013 furthermore the suitability of the low yield springs for such aims was demonstrated by a recent study carried out in the northern apennines tazioli et al 2019 therefore four low yield springs named vsdad vscrp vssen and vsfsa fig 1a placed at different altitudes from 160 to 771 m a s l and fed by small and inferable watersheds were identified and periodically sampled in this way the measured isotopic contents at the springs can be attributed to mean infiltration altitudes that are only slightly higher than the spring altitudes and inferable by morphological and hydrogeological considerations the flow rates and physical chemical parameters t ph ec were measured on site however rainwater was also collected monthly by a rain gauge placed at about 660 m a s l sant anna di stazzema village fig 1a and isotope analysis was performed following the prescriptions as specified by iaea gnip 2014 the rain collector is designed to minimize the evaporation of the collected water by using the anti evaporation system recommended

stream water the time series of daily mean flow rate water level ec and t of the moresco springs and baccatoio stream are given in fig 2 as shown in fig 2a the vsmoa displayed a typical karst flow regime characterized by sharp increases of water flow with very short response time after heavy rainfall events the discharge peaks occurred after a few hours from the meteoric events with increases of daily flow rate exceeding the base flow by even 100 and returning to the flow initial conditions with relatively longer times following the daily rainfall regime the vsmoa flow rate ranged from about 1 9 l s in december 2017 to about 100 l s both in december 2017 and april 2018 in the period between december 2017 and february 2018 the spring showed strong fluctuations from base flow values of about 20 25 l s to maximum values ranging between 60 and 80 l s in response to heavy rainstorms from march 2018 the vsmoa flow rate reached significantly higher values between 50 and 100 l s albeit with a certain variability due to the high and persistent rainfall occurring during this month the water flow gradually decreased from the beginning of april 2018 because of a long period of low precipitation amounts the outflow of the vsmos spring was instead substantially constant from 21 6 to 25 8 l s through the monitored period even though such behavior is very likely tied to the technical arrangement of the tap system indeed the low variability of discharge may depend on different factors including the limited diameter of the draining pipe 15 cm and the development of the tap system deeply in the saturated zone of the aquifer however very low increases in flow rate occurred after intense rainfall events even though they were negligible with respect to the vsmoa behavior the increase of the baccatoio stream water level systematically anticipated the flow rate peaks of the vsmoa by a few hours congruently with the regime of the water level the measured stream flow rate ranged from about 7 l s in september 2018 to about 157 l s in april 2018 table 2 the vsmoa and vsmos showed very similar ec values ranging from 454 to 573 μs cm mean of 510 μs cm fig 2b the baccatoio stream exhibited larger ec variations depending on the season and the hydrologic conditions with values covering the range 242 889 μs cm mean of 518 μs cm heavy rainstorm events resulted in sharp ec decreases at vsmoa and vsmos which occurred almost simultaneously to the stream water dilution albeit with a very lower variation rate starting from april may 2018 and continuing over the dry season the ec of these springs gradually raised to higher values in concomitance with flow rate decreases it is interesting to note the behavior of the stream during intense precipitation events following relatively long dry period sudden ec increases to values much higher than those typical of the base flow were registered and only afterwards ec gradually decreases up to pre event values the ec of the vsmog was instead between 685 and 835 µs cm mean of 751 µs cm significantly higher than vsmoa and vsmos ec appeared to be more stable in the short term even if the daily fluctuations probably due to instrumental issues make signal reading difficult however weak dilutions occurred after intense rainfall and a stronger one was registered from february march to april 2018 following a continuative intense rainy period an increasing ec trend started from may 2018 and persisted until the end of the study period the t of stream water was largely variable fig 2c depending on daily and seasonal changes of atmospheric temperature ranging from 4 3 to 25 4 c the vsmoa and vsmos displayed an identical pattern overlapping curves characterized by slight t decreases after heavy rainstorms and an increasing trend starting from april 2018 until the end of the dry season fig 2c the t at these springs was between 13 0 and 15 0 c mean of 14 1 0 6 c as for the ec the t of vsmog was significantly higher and more stable than the other springs with values ranging from 15 3 to 16 2 c mean of 15 8 0 2 c 4 2 hydrochemistry and water quality the field and major chemical elements data are reported in table 2 the moresco springs showed similar and slightly variable ph values ranging from a minimum of 6 99 vsmog to a maximum of 7 67 vsmoa hydrogen ion concentration was more variable at the baccatoio stream and vstrf with a ph ranging from 7 32 to 8 29 and from 7 40 to 8 36 respectively indicating neutral to slightly alkaline conditions ec and t data during each sampling field were in accordance with the results from continuous monitoring even if only one sample was collected at the porta spring it showed the highest temperature among the studied springs with a value of 16 9 c in agreement with menichini et al 2016 vstrf and porta spring represented the two extremes for ec with values of 425 mean value and 889 µs cm respectively ca2 and hco3 were the main elements of the groundwater samples excepting the porta spring with so4 2 hco3 the major element values of the moresco springs and baccatoio stream were in compliance with the limits for drinkable waters set by italian legislative decree 31 2001 d lgs 31 2001 whereas the porta spring sample exceeded the so4 2 limit chemical data are plotted in the piper trilinear diagram which provides a tool for classifying water types as shown in fig 3 a three main hydrochemical facies are recognized i ca hco3 vstrf vsmoa and vsmos ii ca so4 hco3 vsmog iii ca so4 porta spring and baccatoio stream moresco springs and baccatoio stream showed a relative chemical composition variability suggesting mixing processes between ca hco3 water e g vstrf and ca so4 water porta spring and some samples of the baccatoio stream this variability is mainly due to the so4 concentration which covered the ranges 121 192 mg l 36 92 mg l 93 234 mg l at vsmog vsmoa s and vtmor respectively table 2 fig 3b the baccatoio stream exhibited a higher mg ca ratio in comparison with the springs congruently to ec the total ionic salinity tis of the vsmog was higher than vsmoa and vsmos fig 3b as a whole the samples may be grouped into four classes 1 7 tis 12 meq l with hco3 so4 2 vstrf vsmoa vsmos 2 7 tis 14 meq l with so4 2 hco3 vtmor 3 12 tis 16 meq l with so4 2 and hco3 abundances very similar to each other vsmog 4 tis 18 meq l with so4 2 hco3 porta spring the trace elements data of sampled waters are reported in table 3 all the samples showed pte concentration lower than the italian thresholds for drinkable water except for mn in vtmor in december 2018 85 3 µg l nonetheless the vtmor and one sample of the vsmoa vsmos september 2017 exceeded the tl maximum allowable concentration of 2 µg l for drinking water mcl maximum contaminant level set by environmental protection agency us epa particularly tl concentration was in the ranges 0 70 2 26 µg l at vsmoa s and 9 50 15 1 µg l at vtmor on the contrary the vsmog the only one that feeds the aqueduct showed tl content significantly lower than 2 µg l mean of 0 1 µg l similarly to vstrf 0 1 µg l and porta spring 0 2 µg l as shown in the schoeller berkaloff diagram of fig 4 a the pte usually associated with the mineralization of the baccatoio stream basin cu cd mn pb sb tl zn d orazio et al 2017 were significantly higher at vtmor vsmoa and vsmos than vsmog and vstrf conversely the vsmog was characterized by large amounts of sr mean value of 954 µg l that was about one order of magnitude higher than the other springs except for the porta spring that showed the highest concentration 2235 µg l overall the higher pte contents were detected during the dry season whereas the abundant winter spring rains caused dilution effects lowering the pte concentrations this effect also found by qin et al 2019 in a karst reservoir of southwestern china is particularly evident in fig 4b where it is observed that tl is inversely correlated with the rainfall amount similarly to the molini di sant anna spring in the upper sector of the basin ghezzi et al 2019 specifically vtmor vsmoa and vsmos underwent lowering tl concentrations during high precipitation periods late winter spring season whereas they showed higher concentration during low rainfall periods december 2017 and august 2018 the similar evolution of tl in the not captured springs and stream waters vtmor is to be emphasized fig 4b 4 3 isotopic composition of waters the o h isotope data of water samples are reported in table 4 according to doveri et al 2019b precipitation collected in the baccatoio catchment at 660 m a s l showed large isotopic fluctuations fig 5 a from 8 98 to 3 41 and from 57 9 to 19 5 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the amount weighted average isotopic composition of rain was 6 40 for δ18o and 37 8 for δ2h the stream and spring samples overlapped the local meteoric water line lmwl obtained by doveri et al 2019b blue straight line in fig 5a and the italian meteoric water line imwl giustini et al 2016 indicating a meteoric origin of the sampled groundwater and surface water as shown in fig 5a the moresco springs and baccatoio stream covered a range of values much narrower than for the precipitation and they showed an o h isotopic composition slightly enriched in heavy isotopes compared to the amount weighted average isotopic composition of rainfall the isotopic composition of the vsmog was substantially constant through the survey period fig 6 ranging from 6 26 to 6 10 for δ18o mean value of 6 14 0 05 and from 37 6 to 35 7 for δ2h mean of 36 9 0 7 on the contrary the vsmoa and vsmos showed very similar fluctuations of the isotopic signals as a whole from 6 26 to 5 94 mean of 6 13 0 10 and from 37 6 to 34 5 mean of 36 3 1 0 for δ18o and δ2h respectively likely reflecting the seasonal variability typical of precipitations similar behavior was observed for the baccatoio stream whose δ18o and δ2h values were in the ranges 6 24 6 03 mean of 6 16 0 07 and 36 7 34 2 mean of 35 8 0 9 respectively the enrichment in heavy isotopes occurred during the rainy periods february and april 2018 followed by a depletion during the dry season the physical chemical and isotopic data of the four small springs sampled vsdad vscrp vssen vsfsa are given in table 5 as shown in fig 5b the samples overlapped the lmwl and imwl and covered a range narrower than precipitation the range of values observed for δ18o and δ2h was mainly linked to the altitude effect the o h isotopic composition was relatively stable for vsdad and vscrp whereas vssen and vsfsa showed significant variability for this reason a flow rate weighted isotopic value for each spring was computed as outlined by mcdonnell et al 1990 furthermore the vssen exhibited δ18o and δ2h values inconsistent with its altitude compared to the pattern shown by the other springs fig 7 probably for peculiar hydrodynamic conditions to be better investigate therefore this spring was excluded in the method the regression lines for δ18o and δ2h were achieved by means of comparison among the flow rate weighted average isotopic composition of the accounted springs and the respective inferred infiltration average altitudes fig 7 the regression lines equations were altitude m 912 δ18o 5181 r2 0 999 for δ18o and altitude m 153 δ2h 5167 r2 0 955 for δ2h the former was used to assess the feeding average altitude of the moresco springs since the lower analytical uncertainty anyway the same result may be expected by using the regression line for δ2h the δ18o vertical isotopic gradient was about 0 11 every 100 m of increasing altitude such value was slightly lower than those previously observed in the apuan alps area mussi et al 1998 doveri et al 2013 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater flow systems and stream features the vsmoa and vsmos are recognized as the expression of the same groundwater flow system as indicated by the over time evolution of ec and t and by similar chemical and isotopic data figs 2 3 6 the high discharge peaks of the vsmoa following plentiful precipitation even of 300 400 larger than baseflow and fast returning to the initial flow conditions denote the karst behavior with an elevated transmissivity of the feeding system the residual flow rate that lasts after high discharge peaks is very small compared to the peak values and tends to be fast consumed indicating a reduced storage capacity of the aquifer these hydrodynamic characteristics suggest a prevalence of large fractures in the aquifer in which waters flow with very high velocity conversely the role of a less permeable fracturing system appears to be secondary the variation of the isotopic signals for the vsmoa vsmos system although limited is consistent with this frame the medium term evolution of t from about 13 0 to 15 0 c shown by the vsmoa and vsmos likely indicates a sensitivity to the atmospheric t fig 2c suggesting the presence of at least one shallow flow component such a scheme agrees with the slight isotopic evolution over time fig 8 showing depletion in heavy isotopes during the dry season simultaneously to ec and t increase this pattern points out a significant influence of rainfall probably not directly but very likely through the baccatoio stream which has the same isotopic evolution of the springs fig 8 according to doveri et al 2019b the narrow range of the isotopic composition covered by the baccatoio stream fig 6 indicates that the stream baseflow is mostly represented by the groundwater discharge occurring in the medium high section of the catchment this limits the usefulness of stable water isotopes to highlight the existence of infiltration from the baccatoio stream towards the moresco springs especially with the sampling frequency adopted in this study furthermore respect to other karst aquifers of the apuan alps doveri et al 2019a the vsmoa vsmos system showed a very narrow range of the o h isotopic signature despite the wide isotopic interval registered at the s anna di stazzema rain gauge fig 5a similar behavior was observed in other karst systems worldwide lópez chicano et al 2001 mudarra and andreo 2011 gil márquez et al 2019 and it could be indicative of a dominant piston flow effect pushing old water through the aquifer before the outflow at springs these water mix with the stream water that seems to be the main responsible of the weak isotopic variation at vsmoa and vsmos in any case the involvment of the stream water in the mixing appear to be secondary as suggested by the small ec decreases at springs although the high ec variability of the baccatoio stream as highlighted by the time series of fig 2b and c the vsmog significantly differs from the vsmoa and vsmos considering the average annual values of atmospheric t in the area and the relationship between altitude and mean t for the major springs of the apuan alps piccini et al 1999 doveri et al 2019b the mean value of 15 8 c of the vsmog indicates a groundwater flow path deep enough to be affected by the normal geothermal gradient of the area molli et al 2015 according to the higher ec and its lower variability in the short term the tapped spring drains groundwater characterized by a greater degree of maturity likely linked to a wider and deeper flow system and longer water rock interaction processes the almost constant o h isotopic composition of the vsmog reflects groundwater residence times long enough to completely obliterate the seasonal variability of the rainfall δ18o and δ2h fig 6 this agrees with the aforementioned hypothesis about the flow path scheme which suggests favourable natural conditions for groundwater protection from contamination events the sharp increases in the water level of the baccatoio stream displayed in fig 2a as well as the high flow rates reached after heavy rainfall are typical of torrential regimes the ec evolution occurring in the stream fig 2b may be caused by both the direct rainfall and water coming from springs tributaries and mine drainages perotti et al 2017 while the dilution effects due to rainfall are evident in the wet season they seem to be masked by the contribution of the high ec acid drainages during the low precipitation periods resulting in two different patterns over the year such behavior is likely steered by the different ratios of quantity between runoff and mine drainage components depending on the hydrologic regime it may not be excluded that remobilization processes of mine linked compounds precipitated in the dry periods occur during storm events thus contributing to the stream ec increases 5 2 hydrochemical processes and relationship among water sources as already stated in prior studies e g perotti et al 2017 the ca so4 hydrochemical facies of the baccatoio stream indicates a direct connection between the stream water and the acid mine drainages amd outflowing from mt arsiccio and pollone mines the occurrence of oxidation processes of sulfides mostly pyrite hosted in marbles metadolostones grezzoni fm and schists results in a release of mg so4 2 and various pte including tl to the mine drainages that feed the baccatoio stream as confirmed by the higher mg ca ratio of the stream compared to the moresco springs this effect becomes more negligible during the rainy season when dilution effects occur and the stream baseflow is mostly represented by the groundwater discharge doveri et al 2019b the hydrochemical composition of the moresco springs is typical of groundwater flow systems developed in carbonate aquifers locally represented by calcare cavernoso fm fig 1 according to formula 1 the dissolution of carbonate calcite and or dolomite which releases ca mg and hco3 into groundwater is the predominant process in the study area 1 c a x m g 1 x c o 3 2 2 c o 2 2 h 2 o x c a 2 1 x m g 2 4 h c o 3 the moresco springs are characterized by higher so4 contents than most carbonate springs of the apuan alps doveri et al 2019a and consequently by higher ec and tis values according to the geological mineralogical frame of the basin the high concentration of so4 especially in vsmog may be attributed to two major processes sulfide oxidation of mineralization mostly pyrite hosted in dolostones widespread in the upstream sector of the basin 2 dissolution of gypsum anhydrite that may be present in the deepest portions of calcare cavernoso fm 3 i e buchignani et al 2008 boschetti et al 2011 doveri et al 2015 2019a 2 4 f e s 2 15 o 2 14 h 2 o 4 f e oh 3 8 s o 4 2 16 h 3 cas o 4 2 h 2 o c a 2 s o 4 2 2 h 2 o as shown in the binary diagram of ca mg vs hco3 so4 fig 9 a the groundwater and stream samples are displayed along the 1 1 line highlighting that the dissolution of calcite dolomite likely associated sulfide oxidation and gypsum are the predominant reactions in the groundwater system nonetheless the vsmog differs from the other samples except for vtmor in september 2017 by the higher concentration of these chemical species along with the porta spring that represents an evaporitic member menichini et al 2016 as stated by barbieri et al 2005 for some karst springs in central italy the higher content of solutes indicates a more intense water rock interaction reflecting longer residence times and or deeper flow systems recently de la torre et al 2020 ascribed the gradual increase of t and mineralization values from high altitude springs to low altitude ones to the existence of longer and deeper flowpaths differences between springs can be better evidenced by the binary diagram of mg ca molar ratio vs so4 fig 9b in which two main different water types are observed the first one is characterized by a narrow mg ca range a large interval of so4 concentration and a rough alignment of the vsmog points towards the porta spring this suggests that the gypsum anhydrite dissolution is likely the main source of so4 for vsmog as occurs in other systems made up by the lower part of mesozoic carbonates e g mudarra and andreo 2011 such a hypothesis is congruent with the wider and deeper flow component feeding the vsmog as also suggested by the high sr concentration fig 9c sr is generally present in carbonate and sulphate minerals as vicarious for ca faure 1997 and is typically associated with longer and deeper groundwater flow paths indeed under these conditions the protracted water rock interactions inducing by longer residence time promote the increasing of sr ca ratio in waters as shown in fig 9c the increasing sr concentration corresponds to a rise of so4 in the vsmog and once more it determines an alignment of vsmog points towards the porta spring sample this is congruent with the evaporitic dissolution as a major process in the aquifer feeding the vsmog releasing significant quantities of so4 and sr at the same time the presence of a weak variability of the vsmog chemistry figs 3 and 4b points out a mixing process between a so4 more enriched component and a hco3 more enriched component the latter seems to be similar to the vstrf water toward which the less concentrated vsmog samples move fig 9b c hence a certain lithological heterogeneity of the reservoir may be supposed congruently with the calcare cavernoso fm features in which the prevalent limestone dolostone lithology may result interbedded to gypsum anhydrite layers especially at depth the isotopic stability of the vsmog supports this hypothesis rather than the existence of two different and separated feeding components that unlikely would have the identical isotopic signature resulting in the same recharge mean altitude however mixing between two components hosted in independent reservoirs may not be completely excluded the second group of water in fig 9b is represented by the moresco not captured springs baccatoio stream vtmor and vstrf as displayed in the diagram the vsmoa and vsmos points are lined up between the carbonate end member represented by the vstrf and the ca so4 composition of the vtmor suggesting a possible mixing between the two components in this case the so4 increasing corresponds to a significant rise of mg ca ratio congruently to dolomite dissolution and sulfide oxidation ghezzi et al 2019 as already suggested by natali et al 2019 and nigro et al 2020 this arrangement of the vsmoa and vsmos samples indicates the likely mixing between the stream waters and ca carbonate waters represented by the vstrf pointing out the existence of a hydraulic connection between the baccatoio stream and the vsmoa vsmos system this process is also well highlighted by the comparison of these springs and the stream in terms of evolution of the tl and so4 content over time fig 4b furthermore the binary diagram of fig 9d shows the rough positive correlation between tl and so4 in vsmoa vsmos and vtmor whereas vsmog exhibits constant and very low tl contents with respect to so4 variability the likely mixing among springs and stream waters is also in agreement with the sr vs so4 binary diagram of fig 9c where the not captured springs are once more lined up between vstrf and stream the inverse correlation between tl and rainfall amount fig 4b also highlights that the contribution of tl contaminated end member i e baccatoio stream is weakened in the mixing during the rainy periods late autumn winter early spring this evidence may be tied to the ca carbonate waters of the aquifer which likely provide the bulk of the supply during the wet season even if the dilution of the stream water can promote the observed evolution at the springs actually both the tl contaminated and ca carbonate components increase in quantity during the wet period despite the second component becomes more important in percentage such a process is well pointed out in fig 10 where increasing the vsmoa flow rate the tl concentration decreases but the tl flux increases as already observed by ghezzi et al 2019 in the near molini di sant anna spring by applying the equation 4 of the two components mixing for all the collected samples an interval of 6 10 of stream component is achieved corresponding to a flow rate ranging from about 1 8 6 7 l s with respect to a total spring discharge from about 28 l s to 88 l s 4 t l s smix tl a amix tl tot where tl s tl concentration in the baccatoio stream tl a tl concentration in the vstrf representative of the ca hco3 component of the aquifer tl tot total tl concentration in the vsmoa vsmos springs smix percentage of the stream component in the mixing amix percentage of the ca hco3 component vstrf of the aquifer in the mixing the low concentration of pte especially tl in the vsmog confirms the absence of a hydraulic connection between this spring and the stream consistently with the deeper water circulation that is less sensitive to changes occurring at ground level in the short medium term excluding the sample collected in december 2017 representative of a peculiar lean flow period as the rainy season progressed the dilution of the sulfate component only gradually occurs and with a delay compared to the more rapid response of the not captured springs fig 4b such behavior consequently results in a gradual ec decrease from february to april 2018 fig 2b this inertia and gradual character of the physical chemical evolution lead us to hypothesize that both the flow components involved in the vsmog groundwater system have relatively long and deep circulation developed in medium permeable fracturing systems 5 3 main recharge areas identification through small spring method all the results hitherto discussed indicate the presence of two main groundwater flow systems drained by the vsmog and the ensemble vsmoa vsmos respectively the former system appears to be protected from contaminated waters infiltrating through the streambed unlike the latter which is clearly influenced by the baccatoio stream moreover the transfer of pte towards groundwater systems may occur by diffuse infiltration in areas encompassing mine structures e g tunnels pits rather than through the aforementioned infiltration processes in these terms the evaluation of the main recharge areas of the springs assumes crucial importance for this purpose the water isotope signatures can give significant information the heavy isotopes enrichment shown by the moresco springs respect to the weighted mean isotopic composition of precipitation fig 5a preliminarily indicates a mean recharge altitude lower than 660 m a s l s anna di stazzema rain gauge by comparing the δ18o values of the moresco springs with the regression line altitude δ18o fig 7a a very similar recharge average altitude was assessed for the two moresco groundwater systems ranging from about 350 m to 450 m a s l fig 11 considering the weak but significant variability of the isotopic composition of vsmoa and vsmos a volume weighted mean δ18o of 6 10 was compared with the regression line altitude δ18o on the other hand given the relatively constant flow rate of the vsmog the arithmetic mean values of 6 14 0 05 was used even if the vsmog showed lower isotopic values corresponding to mean altitudes recharge slightly higher for both systems the main feeding areas occur in the low medium portion of the mountain sector of the baccatoio catchment in this sector the pollone mining district develops thus representing a potential source of pte not only by surface acid drainages but also via direct underground transfer 5 4 environmental implications the experimental data demonstrate the good protection of the groundwater system feeding the tapped spring vsmog thus making the spring a real safe source for drinking water distribution on the other hand the detailed understanding of transfer mechanisms of pte towards the not tapped springs vsmoa vsmos excludes at present the possibility of exploitation of this groundwater resource such as vulnerability to contamination by thallium and other pte is enhanced by the particular hydrogeological conditions of the karst environment the hydraulic connectivity with the surface especially in the epiphreatic zone promotes the circulation of oxygenated water which represents the fuel for oxidation processes of sulfides hosted in limestones ghezzi et al 2019 a safe use of this resource would at least require specific actions aimed to avoid the hydraulic connection between the contaminated stream and the aquifer in a more general context ensuring the protection of surface water and groundwater in this specific area would need remediation actions of acid drainages flowing out the mine tunnels however a specific monitoring program can be helpful to local water administrator to mitigate contamination issues 6 conclusions the multi tool survey carried out in a past mining area has highlighted the importance of integrated approaches to understand the groundwater flows in complex carbonate aquifers threatened by anthropic activities in the case study here presented the adopted approach allowed to reach a good understanding of the groundwater systems investigated with particular regard to the possible mechanisms of their interaction with sources of pte the main results well evidence the presence of two distinct separated systems feeding springs very close to each others thus confirming the complexity of the groundwater flow paths arrangement within carbonate aquifers this complexity reflects on the challenging management of karst groundwater resources made possible only by the integration of different techniques and methods for this purpose an integrated approach based on hydrodynamics hydrochemistry and stable water isotopes prove to be useful in similar environments worldwide for policymakers thus the reliable management of water resources and the appropriate allocation of waters with different degrees of quality are correctly steered indeed ensuring water safety and security is one of the main challenges worldwide especially in areas deeply impacted by human activities concerning the environmental issue tied to thallium contamination this study represents one of first attempts to investigate the origin of this element in carbonate groundwater to the best knowledge of the authors only a few studies were carried out to this end both in italy and worldwide xiao et al 2003 ghezzi et al 2019 since thallium was considered uncommon in natural waters until recent years belzile and chen 2017 in this regard the approach here adopted may represent a valid method when facing environmental issues tied to emerging contaminants in carbonate aquifers funding this research received public funding from gaia spa which provides the local integrated water service credit authorship contribution statement m

4946,runoff water quality of green roofs often comes under debate and the mechanism of runoff pollution retention is still unclear how to quantify the influencing contributions of structural factors to runoff pollution of green roofs and optimize the assembled combinations for improving water quality are ambiguous in this study runoff plots of extensive green roofs with taguchi designed structural factors and levels were constructed and simulated rainfall experiments were conducted influences of structural factors on outflow water quality of green roofs were statistically assessed and quantified runoff water quality of green roofs with assembled combinations at specific levels were optimized and predicted by using the taguchi method results showed that except for the ph and no3 concentrations the extensive green roofs acted as a source of the tested pollutants in stormwater runoff contributions of substrate materials on ph ec esp exchangeable sodium percentage f no3 and no2 n concentrations were the highest among the structural factors and contribution percentages ranged from 33 38 to 64 47 the vegetation types had important contributions on cl so4 2 and tp concentrations and the contribution percentage was 74 72 71 23 and 45 16 respectively influences of substrate depths and slope gradients on outflow water quality were small most of the determination

urbanization process associated with population growth is one of the major changes affecting land uses and covers in cities jacqueminet et al 2013 the non construction land are being converted into built up areas resulting in a significant increase in impervious surfaces braud et al 2013 these changes can alter urban hydrological processes and negatively impact downstream water environment in urban ecosystem hibbs and sharp 2012 zhou 2014 the risk of stormwater pollutants entering into urban surface runoff is one of the key concerns related to the security of urban water supply wang et al 2017 recent years a range of stormwater management strategies have been developed in different regions fletcher et al 2015 for example green infrastructure benedict and mcmahon 2012 and low impact development in the usa ahiablame et al 2012 sustainable urban drainage systems stovin 2010 in the uk water sensitive urban design in austria wong and brown 2009 and sponge city in china xia et al 2017 which all have been adopted natural elements and engineered techniques to mitigate urban flooding and non point pollution in urban areas among these practices green roof technology has a potential for providing attractive green space in urban areas where grasslands on the ground are limited thus allowing to its widespread application in cities mentens et al 2006 rowe 2011 the hydrological performance of green roofs has been frequently reported with runoff retention percentages ranged from 50 to 100 by field experiments carson et al 2013 getter et al 2007 liu et al 2019a voyde et al 2010 and statistical numerical models simulation brunetti et al 2016 brunetti et al 2018 2020 locatelli et al 2014 stovin et al 2012 however whether green roofs act as a source or sink of runoff pollutants are still ambiguous buffam et al 2016 wang et al 2017 on one hand green roofs can be adsorbents and filters of runoff pollution some studies have investigated that green roofs have some purification effects on runoff pollution xu et al 2020 that is water quality concentrations from green roofs are much lower than that of normal roofs chen 2013 chen et al 2018 zhou et al 2010 investigated that the removal rate of total nitrogen by green roofs was ranged from 50 to 70 however on the other hand green roofs can potentially contribute to the runoff pollution with nutrients or contaminants released from the substrates akther et al 2020 carpenter et al 2016 gnecco et al 2013 razzaghmanesh et al 2014 todorov et al 2018 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 zhang et al 2015b vijayaraghavan et al 2012 investigated that concentrations of nitrate nitrogen and total phosphorus in green roof runoff were more elevated than that in normal roof runoff therefore water quality of the outflow from green roofs often comes under debate and is still questionable berndtsson 2010 vijayaraghavan et al 2019 pollutants concentrations in green roof runoff are mainly affected by internal factors such as the substrate material composition depth of the growing substrate plant uptake age of the green roof and fertilizer application berndtsson 2010 emilsson et al 2007 gong et al 2020 harper et al 2015 liu et al 2019b wang et al 2017 meanwhile the varied performances of green roofs on water quality are also caused by differences in external factors including the climate conditions antecedent dry period rainfall amount and local pollution sources carpenter et al 2016 driscoll et al 2015 rowe 2011 however the mechanism of green roofs on controlling runoff pollutants remain unclear wang et al 2017 there are several difficulties to quantify the contributions of influencing factors on outflow water quality under various structural designs and experimental conditions risk of runoff pollution restricts the environmental benefits of green roofs which will impede their widespread utilization in urban areas shafique et al 2018 how the water quality of green roof runoff can be improved by optimal design so far only few research efforts have been devoted to tackling this problem vijayaraghavan et al 2019 although several studies have been applied with substrate amendment materials to control the runoff pollution from green roofs bollman et al 2019 jennett and zheng 2018 vijayaraghavan and joshi 2015 vijayaraghavan and raja 2015 limited studies have focused on optimizing their assembled combinations to improve the water quality of green roof runoff gong et al 2020 vijayaraghavan et al 2019 the taguchi method has generally been adopted to determine the optimum conditions of design parameters and significantly minimize the experimental costs and time sadeghi et al 2012 zhang et al 2015a however at present no application of the taguchi method on optimizing water quality of green roof runoff has been reported in this study runoff plots of extensive green roofs were constructed with taguchi designed structural factors substrate material compositions substrate depths vegetation types and slope gradients and levels and simulated rainfall experiments were conducted the aims of the present study were 1 to assess water quality performance of green roofs and statistically quantify the influencing contributions of assembled structures on runoff water quality 2 to optimize the green roofs assembly combinations with specific levels for improving runoff water quality by using the taguchi method 3 to predict the water quality of green roof outflows in response to possible combinations of the designed factors at their application levels this work could promote understanding the mechanism of green roofs on runoff water quality as well as provide an efficient method to better optimizing runoff quality prior to green roof installation 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of runoff plots ten scale based runoff plots with internal dimensions of 1 m wide 1 m long 0 15 0 25 m depth were built using 2 mm thick stainless steel platforms in 2017 fig 1 a from top to bottom the runoff plot of a green roof consisted of vegetation growing substrate filter layer drainage layer and bottom waterproof layer these runoff plots were placed on the runoff testing ground of the dingxi institute of soil and water conservation 35 34 45 88 n 104 38 5 67 e which is located in the dingxi city of gansu province china the area belongs to a semiarid climatic zone with an average annual precipitation of 421 mm the assembled combinations of green roofs were designed following taguchi experimental design with four structural factors i e substrate materials substrate depths vegetation types and slope gradients at three levels table 1 the structural combinations for each runoff plot are shown in fig 1b according to the roof greening material available in china bls 2005 three substrate material compositions were selected as the growing substrates substrate s1 consisted of a mixture of rural soil and peat soil volume ratio was 1 1 substrate s2 consisted of rural soil peat soil pine needle perlite volume ratio was 1 1 1 1 and substrate s3 consisted of rural soil peat soil perlite vermiculite volume ratio was 2 5 5 2 0 5 rural soil was taken from the local cropland which is the infertile clay soil depths of substrates were set to 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm three plant species radix ophiopogonis ophiopogon japonicas linn f ker gawl sedumspectabile hylotelephium erythrostictum miq h ohba and iris iris tectorum maxim which have been widely used in the local landscaping were planted on the green roof for complete coverage the designed slope gradients of the runoff plots were 2 7 and 15 in addition a bare substrate g10 with no vegetation was also built as a control of g1 2 2 rainfall simulation experiments a norton rainfall simulator with two veejet 80100 nozzles set to 2 5 m above the green roof runoff plots was used to simulate rainfall events in the summer of 2019 fig 1c rainfall intensity with 0 3 mm min and rainfall duration of 60 min were chosen according to the local storm formula in the study area rainfall depth was determined using a hobo rg3 m tipping bucket rain gauge onset bourne ma usa during the experimental period six simulated rainfall events were repeated for each green roof runoff plot 2 3 methods for collection and analysis of water samples after each simulated rainfall experiment mixed water samples of the runoff from green roofs were collected with sufficient runoff volume in pre cleaned polyethylene amber bottles for nitrate samples meanwhile 6 rainwater samples were also collected at the experimental period in total 66 water samples were collected and immediately stored in a refrigerator set at 4 c all the water samples were brought to the laboratory and prepared for the test of water quality parameters including ph ec tss k ca2 na mg2 f cl so4 2 no3 tn tp nh4 n and no2 n a ph meter shanghai leici phs 3c was used to monitor ph value and ec value was measured using an electrical conductivity meter leici dds 307 tss concentrations were tested using the filtering drying and weighing method little et al 2005 the analyst 400 atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to measure the concentrations of cations na k ca2 and mg2 and anions f cl so 4 2 and no3 apha et al 2005 the determination standards and procedures of tp tn and no2 n concentrations were according to wei et al 2002 tp concentrations were measured using the ammoniun molybdate spectrophotometric method tn concentrations were determined by the alkaline potassium persulphate digestion uv spectrophotometric method determination of no2 n concentrations was the ethylenediamine spectrophotometric nh4 n concentrations were tested using the microdistillation flow analysis davey et al 2011 also the degree of alkalization which defined as exchangeable sodium percentage esp was calculated by the following equation 1 e s p n a n a c a 2 m g 2 k 100 where na ca2 mg2 k is the ion concentration mg l respectively 2 4 statistical analysis green roofs with the same structural factor n 18 and rainwater n 6 were classed as statistical groups due to the water quality data did not conform to the normality assumption the non parametric kruskal wallis test was applied to compare the median values of water quality concentrations among the four structural factors univariate analysis of variance for taguchi designed experimental data were performed to statistically quantify the contribution percentages of structural factors to water quality parameters of the green roof outflows n 54 the statistical analysis was carried out with spss statistics version 17 0 2 5 taguchi method in the taguchi method an analysis of the signal to noise s n ratio is needed to determine the deviation of quality characteristics from the desired value taguchi 1990 s n ratio was used to measure how the response varies the target value under different noise conditions specifically a s n ratio with smaller is better characteristic i e lower water quality concentrations represent better water quality of green roof outflows was selected as an objective function for optimization because this study was targeted to determine the conditions in which minimum pollutants contain in green roof runoff the larger the s n ratio is the smaller the effect of noise factor the s n ratio for the smaller is better type was calculated by the following equation 2 s n 10 log 10 1 n i 1 n y i 2 where n is the number of experimental repetitions and yi represents the observed concentrations of water quality the analysis of means statistical method was used to determine the optimal conditions under which the maximum value occurred first the mean of the s n ratios of each factor l at a certain level i m was calculated by the following equation 3 m factor l level i 1 n li j 1 n li s n factor l level i j where m factor l level i is the mean of thes nratios of factor l at level i and nli represents the number of occurrences of factor l at level i then the optimum conditions were identified as those producing the highest mean value of thes nratios of each factor at a particular level the influence of each structural factor on the outflow water quality was statistically assessed by the univariate analysis of variance the percentage contribution pc of each structural factor to outflow water quality was calculated by the following formula 4 pc ss f d f v er ss t 100 where ssf is the factorial sum of squares df is thedegrees of freedom ver is the variance in the error and sst is the total sum of squares water quality data from five experimental repetitions of green roofs except g10 n 45 were used to calculate the s n ratio of each green roof using the main effects analysis of s n ratios for designed factors and levels the optimum conditions for improving each water quality parameter were identified then water quality data except the main effects analysis n 9 were used as a validation dataset to validate the predicted accuracy of water quality concentrations under the taguchi design conditions analysis and predictions of taguchi method were carried out using submenus in minitab 17 software statistical and fitted charts were prepared in the sigmaplot 12 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of water quality from green roof outflows statistical characteristics of 30 simulated rainfall events are summarized in table 2 during the simulated rainfall experiments the average rainfall depth was 23 43 mm with a mean rainfall intensity of 0 39 mm minute and a duration of 60 min according to the local storm formula the average return period of the simulated rainfalls was about 5 7 years the mean minimum and maximum values of water quality concentrations of the rainwater input and outflows from ten green roofs are shown in table 3 mean no3 concentration in green roof outflow was decreased by 51 than that of the rainwater input averaged esp tss and so4 2 concentrations in green roof runoff were slightly elevated by 12 19 of the rainwater the mean values of ec tn and tp concentrations were increased by approximately 40 the averaged cl nh4 n f and no2 n concentrations in the green roof runoff was 1 5 4 3 4 4 and 6 7 times respectively than that of the rainwater however the majority of water quality parameters of the green roof outflows fell within the class iii water quality standard table 3 according to the environmental quality standards for surface water of china gb 3838 2002 therefore the overall performance of runoff water quality from green roofs was partly considered to be good 3 2 impacts of substrate materials on water quality of green roof outflow statistically results showed that the runoff from substrate s1 displayed significantly higher ph values and lower ec f concentrations than the runoff from substrate s2 fig 2 all p values 0 001 and substrate s3 all p values 0 001 the outflow from substrate s2 displayed significantly lower esp no3 no2 n and higher nh4 n concentrations than that from substrate s1 in turn p 0 001 p 0 01 p 0 05 p 0 01 substrate s3 had significantly higher esp no3 and lower tp nh4 n concentrations in the outflows from green roofs than that from substrate s2 in turn p 0 001 p 0 001 p 0 05 p 0 01 tp concentrations were significantly lower in the runoff from substrate s3 than that in substrate s1 p 0 05 however no statistically significant difference was found among the runoff from three substrate material compositions in concentrations of tss cl so 4 2 and tn between the runoff from substrate s2 and s3 in ph ec f concentrations and between the outflow runoff from substrate s1 and s3 with regard to no3 no2 n and nh4 n concentrations 3 3 effects of substrate depths on water quality of green roof outflows as the substrate depths increased from 5 cm to 15 cm the averaged ec esp cl tn and no2 n concentrations in green roof outflows were elevated fig 3 indicating that the thicker substrates were readily leached pollutants out however there was no significant difference in ph tss f cl no3 tn tp and nh4 n concentrations from green roof outflows among the substrate depth treatments ec values in runoff from the 5 cm thick substrate were significantly lower than the substrate depths of 10 cm and 15 cm p 0 01 p 0 05 esp values in green roof runoff for the 15 cm substrate depth were significantly higher than the 5 cm and 10 cm substrate depths p 0 001 p 0 01 so4 2 concentrations in green roof runoff for the 15 cm substrate depth were significantly higher than that in the 5 cm and 10 cm substrate depth treatments all p values 0 05 no2 n concentrations in green roof outflows for the 5 cm substrate depth were significantly lower than that in the 10 cm and 15 cm substrate depths all p values 0 01 3 4 impacts of vegetation types on water quality of green roofs runoff water quality concentrations of outflows from the green roofs planted with three vegetation types are shown in fig 4 there were significantly lower ec cl so4 2 no3 tp and no2 n concentrations of outflows from green roofs planted with radix ophiopogonis than those with sedum spectabile in turn p 0 05 p 0 001 p 0 001 p 0 01 p 0 001 p 0 001 similarly significantly lower ec cl so4 2 no3 tp and no2 n concentrations were also found from the green roof planted with radix ophiopogonis than the green roof with iris in turn p 0 05 p 0 001 p 0 001 p 0 01 p 0 001 p 0 001 significantly lower concentrations were observed in so 4 2 and tp parameters between green roofs planted with sedum spectabile and iris p 0 01 p 0 05 however no significant difference was investigated among the vegetation types of green roof runoff with respect to ph esp tss f tn and nh4 n concentrations results from table 4 showed that the vegetated green roof g1 had statistically significant lower esp f cl no3 tn and no2 n concentrations in outflows than the bare green roof g10 in turn p 0 01 p 0 01 p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 05 p 0 01 however there was no significant statistical difference in ph ec tss so4 2 tp and nh4 n between runoff from the vegetated and bare green roof 3 5 effects of slope gradients on runoff water quality of green roof outflows results showed that the mean f and tp concentrations in outflows increased as the slope of green roofs increased from 2 to 12 fig 5 the mean f concentration of the 2 slope green roof was significantly lower than in the 7 and 12 slope gradient treatments all p values 0 01 the mean tp concentration in green roof with the 7 slope was significantly lower than that in the 12 slope gradient p 0 05 conversely the 2 slope green roof had significantly higher no3 concentrations in outflows than green roof with 12 slope gradient p 0 05 however there was no statistically significant difference in the ph ec esp tss cl so4 2 tn nh4 n and no2 n concentrations of green roof runoff among the three slope gradients 3 6 contributions of structural factors on water quality of green roof outflows statistical results of univariate analysis of variance for the effects of structural factors on water quality parameters of green roof outflows are shown in table 5 influencing contributions of substrate materials on ph ec esp f no3 and no2 n concentrations were the highest among four structural factors p 0 001 the contribution percentages ranged from 33 38 to 64 47 vegetation types had high contributions on cl so4 2 and tp concentrations and the contribution percentage was 74 72 71 23 and 45 16 respectively p 0 001 contributions of substrate depths on water quality from green roof outflows ranged from 6 14 to 35 29 substrate depths acted as the second important factor on ph ec esp and so4 2 concentrations of green roof outflows the influences of slope gradients on water quality of green roof runoff were small the contribution percentages of ph ec esp cl so4 2 and no2 n ranged from 0 15 to 8 67 however the present analysis showed that structural factors did not have statistically significant influences on tss tn and nh4 n concentrations of green roof outflows for the analyzed rainfall events f values 1 consequently among the studied structural factors substrate material compositions and vegetation types contributed notably to water quality of green roof outflows 3 7 optimization of structural combinations for improving runoff water quality fig 6 presents the trends of the main effects of s n ratios with the factors and levels combinations of green roofs from the taguchi method according to the main effect analysis for each factor the optimum conditions for improving each water quality parameter were identified as those producing the highest s n ratios for each factor at a particular level it showed that most of the optimum conditions for improving water quality of green roofs contained substrate s1 with substrate depth of 5 cm and planted with radix ophiopogonis 3 8 prediction performance of runoff water quality from green roofs the simulated performances for water quality parameters of green roof runoff between the predicted versus measured concentrations under the taguchi design conditions are shown in fig 7 except for tss and nh4 n the determination coefficients r 2 of regression analysis between the measured and predicted water quality parameters were ranged from 0 843 to 0 997 however the prediction performances of tss and nh4 n concentrations were relatively poor r 2 between the measured and predicted concentrations were 0 497 and 0 674 respectively therefore these results validated the high accuracy of the taguchi method to predict outflow water quality under the taguchi design conditions water quality from the other possible structural combinations of green roofs except taguchi designed conditions could also be predicted by using the taguchi method the predicted concentrations of outflow water quality under the optimum combinations of green roofs are listed in table 6 except the ph and no3 parameters concentrations of the other water quality parameters under their optimum conditions were decreased by 10 2 to 77 6 for example under the case of best improvement mean concentration of f under the experimental combinations were ranged from 0 31 mg l to 1 13 mg l and the mean value with the optimal condition was improved to 0 069 mg l the lowest improving effectiveness of ph was 5 45 in addition it was noted that the optimum factors levels of no3 concentration were the same as the designed combinations in the experiments 4 discussion 4 1 overall performances of water quality from green roofs runoff in the current study 51 reduction percentage of the mean no3 concentrations was investigated in the green roof runoff compared with rainwater it indicated a certain purify effect of green roofs on nitrate ion this is consistent with the findings of previous studies that green roofs are a sink for nitrate berndtsson et al 2009 speak et al 2014 except for the ph and no 3 mean concentrations of the other water quality parameters from green roof outflows were all higher than the rainwater input it indicated that the studied green roofs acted as a source of most of the runoff pollutants in the present study due to the rainwater is relatively pure outflow runoff pollution caused by the green roof is remarkable the results were aligned with the investigation by zhang et al 2015b in that green roofs significantly increased the concentrations of runoff pollutants including f cl nh4 n and no2 n it was noted that the mean ec value increased from 295 17 μs cm in rainwater to 418 33 μs cm in green roof outflows as a result of the increase in dissolved ion content green roofs elevated the concentration of anions and cations in outflows it probably derived from the substrate materials by rainwater leaching consistently rainfall leachate effects on green roofs were also investigated by john et al 2017 and teemusk and mander 2007 in effect substrate materials can act as the ion exchange filter for runoff pollutants if the ion concentration in rainwater is lower than that of the green roof substrate some ions will seep into the rainwater from the substrate although the overall performance of runoff water quality was partly considered to be good runoff with elevated ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen is of concern as it will potentially cause eutrophication of urban surface water therefore the risk of runoff pollution form green roof outflows needed to be cautiously addressed and controlled 4 2 influences of structural factors on water quality of green roof runoff 4 2 1 composition of substrate materials in this study substrate s2 consisted of peat soil and pine needle has a high nutrient content resulted in higher esp no3 and no2 n concentrations in runoff from substrate s2 than s1 in general substrate component materials contain nutrients that could contribute to rainwater leaching occurred from the substrate dusza et al 2017 liu et al 2019b investigated that substrate significantly impact stormwater runoff quality of extensive green roofs the chemical substances in the substrate were washed out into the outflow thus the substrate materials played a critical role in water quality of green roof outflow harper et al 2015 gong et al 2019 moran et al 2003 pointed out that nitrogen and phosphorus amounts in green roof outflow were directly related to the organic matter content in the substrate akther et al 2021 concluded that substrate was the primary source for nutrients leached however organic rich substrate not only raised the availability of nutrients to plants but also lead to high leaching rates of nitrogen beecham and razzaghmanesh 2015 rowe et al 2006 nagase and dunnett 2011 investigated that the decomposing peat was considered inappropriate for substrate materials of green roofs thus the desirable substrates for green roofs would possess high sorption capacity and consist of less rich organic matter moreover recent studies from gong et al 2020 and vijayaraghavan et al 2019 reported that the pollutant purification effect of green roofs can be improved by optimizing the composition of substrate materials 4 2 2 depths of substrate in the present study results showed that the mean ec esp cl tn and no2 n concentrations in green roofs runoff were raised as the substrate depths increased from 5 cm to 15 cm and the pollutants were readily leached out from the thicker substrates this trend was aligned with the seidl et al 2013 and gong et al 2020 that deeper substrates can result in higher nitrogen leaching an explanation is that when the substrate depth was deeper substrate background contained more nutrients thus nutrients were more prone to being leached from the green roof shallower substrate will have lower runoff retention capacity and allows pollutants to pass quickly into outflow runoff berndtsson et al 2009 however the role of substrate depth in runoff water quality is less consistent conversely denardo et al 2005 and berndtsson et al 2006 concluded that deeper substrates may increase the duration of runoff retention allowing increased the levels of adsorption or chemical dissolution reaction resulting in a decrease of pollutants content in the green roof runoff 4 2 3 vegetation types in the current study green roof planted with sedum spectabile had the highest and radix ophiopogonis green roof had the lowest ec cl so4 no3 tp and no2 n concentrations the results were similar to the findings of john et al 2017 in that green roof planted with sedum released more nutrients into outflow runoff the role of plant uptake on runoff pollutants from green roof would be plant species dependent monterusso 2004 investigated that plants with higher nutrient demands and transpiration rates can retain more runoff pollutants however vegetation usually has positive and negative functions on runoff water quality of green roofs on one hand plants can absorb and metabolize pollutants in the substrate in this study the vegetated green roof had significantly lower esp f cl no 3 tn and no2 n concentrations in outflows than the bare green roof which is similar to the results reported by beecham and razzaghmanesh 2015 speak et al 2014 and vijayaraghavan and joshi 2014 these studies highlighted the possibility of water quality improvement through vegetation effect on the other hand nutrient content of the substrate will be changed by the decomposition of fallen leaves and regenerated roots of plants and metabolites of substrate soil microbial processes all of which will increase pollutants source in green roof outflow dusza et al 2017 sutton and lambrinos 2015 aitkenhead peterson et al 2011 indicated that there was higher leachate of nitrogen from a green roof planted with sedum than from the bare substrate however most of nutrient loss in the substrate results from rainwater leaching was larger than biodegradation effect in addition the lack of adequate characterization of growing vegetation challenges the quantitative investigation of the role of vegetation on runoff water quality 4 3 advantages of taguchi method to investigate the impacts of structural factors on outflow water quality of green roofs many laboratories and field experiments have been conducted under various structural combinations berndtsson 2010 vijayaraghavan et al 2019 nevertheless the number of experimental combinations exponentially grows with the number of factors and their levels increased smucker et al 2018 thus it is time consuming and costly to run for tests box et al 2005 the taguchi method is economical and efficient because it requires a minimum number of experimental tests and meanwhile its conclusions are associated with statistical levels of confidence taguchi 1990 in this study simulation results validated the high accuracy of the taguchi method to predict outflow water quality under the structural combinations with taguchi design in this case taguchi method can be used to accurately predict water quality within a study area given limited experimental conditions and without having to commit to a large amount of work liu et al 2019c examined the ability of the taguchi method to predict runoff retention at small sized plot scale with an acceptable level of accuracy zhang et al 2021 suggested that the soil erosion results obtained from the taguchi method were much closer than those obtained from a full factorial design at the slope scale sadeghi et al 2012 concluded that the taguchi method obtained reliable experimental conclusions without losing valuable information to some extent it could act as a substitute for the full factorial design therefore the taguchi method would be a reliable and economical method to optimize and predict outflow water quality of green roofs in response to different combinations of the designed factors and application levels 5 conclusions the present study assessed the influences of structural factors on water quality of green roof runoff and applied taguchi method for optimizing assembled combinations and predicting outflow water quality the results showed that green roofs acted as a source of most of the studied water quality parameters moreover the majority of water quality parameters of green roof outflows fell into the class iii water quality standard therefore it was concluded that the overall performance of runoff water quality from green roofs was partly considered to be good substrate materials and vegetation types contributed notably to water quality of green roof outflows moreover green roofs with less organic materials in the substrate showed better water quality green roofs planted with radix ophiopogonis had the lowest water quality concentrations vegetated green roof had significantly lower water quality concentrations than bare substrate pollutants were readily leached into outflow runoff from green roofs through the thicker substrate the influences of substrate depths and slope gradients on runoff water quality were small the taguchi method was successfully applied for optimizing the assembled combinations of green roofs for improving each water quality parameter it also validated that the taguchi method had a reliable accuracy to predict outflow water quality of green roofs in summary in order to mitigate runoff pollution risk from green roofs on urban water environment two aspects should be carefully considered first green roof system should be designed with an appropriate selection of substrate material composition and scientific screening of plant species second there is a need to determine the optimum assembly combinations of green roofs under some specific design conditions to improve outflow water quality prior to installation meanwhile the taguchi method was validated to be a simple and reliable method

4946,runoff water quality of green roofs often comes under debate and the mechanism of runoff pollution retention is still unclear how to quantify the influencing contributions of structural factors

structural factors and levels were constructed and simulated rainfall experiments were conducted influences of structural factors on outflow water quality of green roofs were statistically assessed and quantified runoff water quality of green roofs with assembled combinations at specific levels were optimized and predicted by using the taguchi method results showed that except for the ph and no3 concentrations the extensive green roofs acted as a source of the tested pollutants in stormwater runoff contributions of substrate materials on ph ec esp exchangeable sodium percentage f no3 and no2 n concentrations were the highest among the structural factors and contribution percentages ranged from 33 38 to 64 47 the vegetation types had important contributions on cl so4 2 and tp

performance of green roofs has been frequently reported with runoff retention percentages ranged from 50 to 100 by field experiments carson et al 2013 getter et al 2007 liu et al 2019a voyde et al 2010 and statistical numerical models simulation brunetti et al 2016 brunetti et al 2018 2020 locatelli et al 2014 stovin et al 2012 however whether green roofs act as a source or sink of runoff pollutants are still ambiguous buffam et al 2016 wang et al 2017 on one hand green roofs can be adsorbents and filters of runoff pollution some studies have investigated that green roofs have some purification effects on runoff pollution xu et al 2020 that is water quality concentrations from green roofs are much lower than that of normal roofs chen 2013 chen et al 2018 zhou et al 2010 investigated that the removal rate of total nitrogen by green roofs was ranged from 50 to 70 however on the other hand green roofs can potentially contribute to the runoff pollution with nutrients or contaminants released from the substrates akther et al 2020 carpenter et al 2016 gnecco et al 2013 razzaghmanesh et al 2014 todorov et al 2018 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 zhang et al 2015b vijayaraghavan et al 2012 investigated that concentrations of nitrate nitrogen and total phosphorus in green roof runoff were more elevated than that in normal roof runoff therefore water quality of the outflow from green roofs often comes under debate and is still questionable berndtsson 2010 vijayaraghavan et al 2019 pollutants concentrations in green roof runoff are mainly affected by internal factors such as the substrate material composition depth of the growing substrate plant uptake age of the green roof and fertilizer application berndtsson 2010 emilsson et al 2007 gong et al 2020 harper et al 2015 liu et al 2019b wang et al 2017 meanwhile the varied performances of green roofs on water quality are also caused by differences in external factors including the climate conditions antecedent dry period rainfall amount and local pollution sources carpenter et al 2016 driscoll et al 2015 rowe 2011 however the mechanism of green roofs on controlling runoff pollutants remain unclear wang et al 2017 there are several difficulties to quantify the contributions of influencing factors on outflow water quality under various structural designs and experimental conditions risk of runoff pollution restricts the environmental benefits of green roofs which will impede their widespread utilization in urban areas shafique et al 2018 how the water quality of green roof runoff can be improved by optimal design so far only few research efforts have been devoted to tackling this problem vijayaraghavan et al 2019 although several studies have been applied with substrate amendment materials to control the runoff pollution from green roofs bollman et al 2019 jennett and zheng 2018 vijayaraghavan and joshi 2015 vijayaraghavan and raja 2015 limited studies have focused on optimizing their assembled combinations to improve the water quality of green roof runoff gong et al 2020 vijayaraghavan et al 2019 the taguchi method has generally been adopted to determine the optimum conditions of design parameters and significantly minimize the experimental costs and time sadeghi et al 2012 zhang et al 2015a however at present no application of the taguchi method on optimizing water quality of green roof runoff has been reported in this study runoff plots of extensive green roofs were constructed with taguchi designed structural factors substrate material compositions substrate depths vegetation types and slope gradients and levels and simulated rainfall experiments were conducted the aims of the present study were 1 to assess water quality performance of green roofs and statistically quantify the influencing contributions of assembled structures on runoff water quality 2 to optimize the green roofs assembly combinations with specific levels for improving runoff water quality by using the taguchi method 3 to predict the water quality of green roof outflows in response to possible combinations of the designed factors at their application levels this work could promote understanding the mechanism of green roofs on runoff water quality as well as provide an efficient method to better optimizing runoff quality prior to green roof installation 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of runoff plots ten scale based runoff plots with internal dimensions of 1 m wide 1 m long 0 15 0 25 m depth were built using 2 mm thick stainless steel platforms in 2017 fig 1 a from top to bottom the runoff plot of a green roof consisted of vegetation growing substrate filter layer drainage layer and bottom waterproof layer these runoff plots were placed on the runoff testing ground of the dingxi institute of soil and water conservation 35 34 45 88 n 104 38 5 67 e which is located in the dingxi city of gansu province china the area belongs to a semiarid climatic zone with an average annual precipitation of 421 mm the assembled combinations of green roofs were designed following taguchi experimental design with four structural factors i e substrate materials substrate depths vegetation types and slope gradients at three levels table 1 the structural combinations for each runoff plot are shown in fig 1b according to the roof greening material available in china bls 2005 three substrate material compositions were selected as the growing substrates substrate s1 consisted of a mixture of rural soil and peat soil volume ratio was 1 1 substrate s2 consisted of rural soil peat soil pine needle perlite volume ratio was 1 1 1 1 and substrate s3 consisted of rural soil peat soil perlite vermiculite volume ratio was 2 5 5 2 0 5 rural soil was taken from the local cropland which is the infertile clay soil depths of substrates were set to 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm three plant species radix ophiopogonis ophiopogon japonicas linn f ker gawl sedumspectabile hylotelephium erythrostictum miq h ohba and iris iris tectorum maxim which have been widely used in the local landscaping were planted on the green roof for complete coverage the designed slope gradients of the runoff plots were 2 7 and 15 in addition a bare substrate g10 with no vegetation was also built as a control of g1 2 2 rainfall simulation experiments a norton rainfall simulator with two veejet 80100 nozzles set to 2 5 m above the green roof runoff plots was used to simulate rainfall events in the summer of 2019 fig 1c rainfall intensity with 0 3 mm min and rainfall duration of 60 min were chosen according to the local storm formula in the study area rainfall depth was determined using a hobo rg3 m tipping bucket rain gauge onset bourne ma usa during the experimental period six simulated rainfall events were repeated for each green roof runoff plot 2 3 methods for collection and analysis of water samples after each simulated rainfall experiment mixed water samples of the runoff from green roofs were collected with sufficient runoff volume in pre cleaned polyethylene amber bottles for nitrate samples meanwhile 6 rainwater samples were also collected at the experimental period in total 66 water samples were collected and immediately stored in a refrigerator set at 4 c all the water samples were brought to the laboratory and prepared for the test of water quality parameters including ph ec tss k ca2 na mg2 f cl so4 2 no3 tn tp nh4 n and no2 n a ph meter shanghai leici phs 3c was used to monitor ph value and ec value was measured using an electrical conductivity meter leici dds 307 tss concentrations were tested using the filtering drying and weighing method little et al 2005 the analyst 400 atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to measure the concentrations of cations na k ca2 and mg2 and anions f cl so 4 2 and no3 apha et al 2005 the determination standards and procedures of tp tn and no2 n concentrations were according to wei et al 2002 tp concentrations were measured using the ammoniun molybdate spectrophotometric method tn concentrations were determined by the alkaline potassium persulphate digestion uv spectrophotometric method determination of no2 n concentrations was the ethylenediamine spectrophotometric nh4 n concentrations were tested using the microdistillation flow analysis davey et al 2011 also the degree of alkalization which defined as exchangeable sodium percentage esp was calculated by the following equation 1 e s p n a n a c a 2 m g 2 k 100 where na ca2 mg2 k is the ion concentration mg l respectively 2 4 statistical analysis green roofs with the same structural factor n 18 and rainwater n 6 were classed as statistical groups due to the water quality data did not conform to the normality assumption the non parametric kruskal wallis test was applied to compare the median values of water quality concentrations among the four structural factors univariate analysis of variance for taguchi designed experimental data were performed to statistically quantify the contribution percentages of structural factors to water quality parameters of the green roof outflows n 54 the statistical analysis was carried out with spss statistics version 17 0 2 5 taguchi method in the taguchi method an analysis of the signal to noise s n ratio is needed to determine the deviation of quality characteristics from the desired value taguchi 1990 s n ratio was used to measure how the response varies the target value under different noise conditions specifically a s n ratio with smaller is better characteristic i e lower water quality concentrations represent better water quality of green roof outflows was selected as an objective function for optimization because this study was targeted to determine the conditions in which minimum pollutants contain in green roof runoff the larger the s n ratio is the smaller the effect of noise factor the s n ratio for the smaller is better type was calculated by the following equation 2 s n 10 log 10 1 n i 1 n y i 2 where n is the number of experimental repetitions and yi represents the observed concentrations of water quality the analysis of means statistical method was used to determine the optimal conditions under which the maximum value occurred first the mean of the s n ratios of each factor l at a certain level i m was calculated by the following equation 3 m factor l level i 1 n li j 1 n li s n factor l level i j where m factor l level i is the mean of thes nratios of factor l at level i and nli represents the number of occurrences of factor l at level i then the optimum conditions were identified as those producing the highest mean value of thes nratios of each factor at a particular level the influence of each structural factor on the outflow water quality was statistically assessed by the univariate analysis of variance the percentage contribution pc of each structural factor to outflow water quality was calculated by the following formula 4 pc ss f d f v er ss t 100 where ssf is the factorial sum of squares df is thedegrees of freedom ver is the variance in the error and sst is the total sum of squares water quality data from five experimental repetitions of green roofs except g10 n 45 were used to calculate the s n ratio of each green roof using the main effects analysis of s n ratios for designed factors and levels the optimum conditions for improving each water quality parameter were identified then water quality data except the main effects analysis n 9 were used as a validation dataset to validate the predicted accuracy of water quality concentrations under the taguchi design conditions analysis and predictions of taguchi method were carried out using submenus in minitab 17 software statistical and fitted charts were prepared in the sigmaplot 12 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of water quality from green roof outflows statistical characteristics of 30 simulated rainfall events are summarized in table 2 during the simulated rainfall experiments the average rainfall depth was 23 43 mm with a mean rainfall intensity of 0 39 mm minute and a duration of 60 min according to the local storm formula the average return period of the simulated rainfalls was about 5 7 years the mean minimum and maximum values of water quality concentrations of the rainwater input and outflows from ten green roofs are shown in table 3 mean no3 concentration in green roof outflow was decreased by 51 than that of the rainwater input averaged esp tss and so4 2 concentrations in green roof runoff were slightly elevated by 12 19 of the rainwater the mean values of ec tn and tp concentrations were increased by approximately 40 the averaged cl nh4 n f and no2 n concentrations in the green roof runoff was 1 5 4 3 4 4 and 6 7 times respectively than that of the rainwater however the majority of water quality parameters of the green roof outflows fell within the class iii water quality standard table 3 according to the environmental quality standards for surface water of china gb 3838 2002 therefore the overall performance of runoff water quality from green roofs was partly considered to be good 3 2 impacts of substrate materials on water quality of green roof outflow statistically results showed that the runoff from substrate s1 displayed significantly higher ph values and lower ec f concentrations than the runoff from substrate s2 fig 2 all p values 0 001 and substrate s3 all p values 0 001 the outflow from substrate s2 displayed significantly lower esp no3 no2 n and higher nh4 n concentrations than that from substrate s1 in turn p 0 001 p 0 01 p 0 05 p 0 01 substrate s3 had significantly higher esp no3 and lower tp nh4 n concentrations in the outflows from green roofs than that from substrate s2 in turn p 0 001 p 0 001 p 0 05 p 0 01 tp concentrations were significantly lower in the runoff from substrate s3 than that in substrate s1 p 0 05 however no statistically significant difference was found among the runoff from three substrate material compositions in concentrations of tss cl so 4 2 and tn between the runoff from substrate s2 and s3 in ph ec f concentrations and between the outflow runoff from substrate s1 and s3 with regard to no3 no2 n and nh4 n concentrations 3 3 effects of substrate depths on water quality of green roof outflows as the substrate depths increased from 5 cm to 15 cm the averaged ec esp cl tn and no2 n concentrations in green roof outflows were elevated fig 3 indicating that the thicker substrates were readily leached pollutants out however there was no significant difference in ph tss f cl no3 tn tp and nh4 n concentrations from green roof outflows among the substrate depth treatments ec values in runoff from the 5 cm thick substrate were significantly lower than the substrate depths of 10 cm and 15 cm p 0 01 p 0 05 esp values in green roof runoff for the 15 cm substrate depth were significantly higher than the 5 cm and 10 cm substrate depths p 0 001 p 0 01 so4 2 concentrations in green roof runoff for the 15 cm substrate depth were significantly higher than that in the 5 cm and 10 cm substrate depth treatments all p values 0 05 no2 n concentrations in green roof outflows for the 5 cm substrate depth were significantly lower than that in the 10 cm and 15 cm substrate depths all p values 0 01 3 4 impacts of vegetation types on water quality of green roofs runoff water quality concentrations of outflows from the green roofs planted with three vegetation types are shown in fig 4 there were significantly lower ec cl so4 2 no3 tp and no2 n concentrations of outflows from green roofs planted with radix ophiopogonis than those with sedum spectabile in turn p 0 05 p 0 001 p 0 001 p 0 01 p 0 001 p 0 001 similarly significantly lower ec cl so4 2 no3 tp and no2 n concentrations were also found from the green roof planted with radix ophiopogonis than the green roof with iris in turn p 0 05 p 0 001 p 0 001 p 0 01 p 0 001 p 0 001 significantly lower concentrations were observed in so 4 2 and tp parameters between green roofs planted with sedum spectabile and iris p 0 01 p 0 05 however no significant difference was investigated among the vegetation types of green roof runoff with respect to ph esp tss f tn and nh4 n concentrations results from table 4 showed that the vegetated green roof g1 had statistically significant lower esp f cl no3 tn and no2 n concentrations in outflows than the bare green roof g10 in turn p 0 01 p 0 01 p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 05 p 0 01 however there was no significant statistical difference in ph ec tss so4 2 tp and nh4 n between runoff from the vegetated and bare green roof 3 5 effects of slope gradients on runoff water quality of green roof outflows results showed that the mean f and tp concentrations in outflows increased as the slope of green roofs increased from 2 to 12 fig 5 the mean f concentration of the 2 slope green roof was significantly lower than in the 7 and 12 slope gradient treatments all p values 0 01 the mean tp concentration in green roof with the 7 slope was significantly lower than that in the 12 slope gradient p 0 05 conversely the 2 slope green roof had significantly higher no3 concentrations in outflows than green roof with 12 slope gradient p 0 05 however there was no statistically significant difference in the ph ec esp tss cl so4 2 tn nh4 n and no2 n concentrations of green roof runoff among the three slope gradients 3 6 contributions of structural factors on water quality of green roof outflows statistical results of univariate analysis of variance for the effects of structural factors on water quality parameters of green roof outflows are shown in table 5 influencing contributions of substrate materials on ph ec esp f no3 and no2 n concentrations were the highest among four structural factors p 0 001 the contribution percentages ranged from 33 38 to 64 47 vegetation types had high contributions on cl so4 2 and tp concentrations and the contribution percentage was 74 72 71 23 and 45 16 respectively p 0 001 contributions of substrate depths on water quality from green roof outflows ranged from 6 14 to 35 29 substrate depths acted as the second important factor on ph ec esp and so4 2 concentrations of green roof outflows the influences of slope gradients on water quality of green roof runoff were small the contribution percentages of ph ec esp cl so4 2 and no2 n ranged from 0 15 to 8 67 however the present analysis showed that structural factors did not have statistically significant influences on tss tn and nh4 n concentrations of green roof outflows for the analyzed rainfall events f values 1 consequently among the studied structural factors substrate material compositions and vegetation types contributed notably to water quality of green roof outflows 3 7 optimization of structural combinations for improving runoff water quality fig 6 presents the trends of the main effects of s n ratios with the factors and levels combinations of green roofs from the taguchi method according to the main effect analysis for each factor the optimum conditions for improving each water quality parameter were identified as those producing the highest s n ratios for each factor at a particular level it showed that most of the optimum conditions for improving water quality of green roofs contained substrate s1 with substrate depth of 5 cm and planted with radix ophiopogonis 3 8 prediction performance of runoff water quality from green roofs the simulated performances for water quality parameters of green roof runoff between the predicted versus measured concentrations under the taguchi design conditions are shown in fig 7 except for tss and nh4 n the determination coefficients r 2 of regression analysis between the measured and predicted water quality parameters were ranged from 0 843 to 0 997 however the prediction performances of tss and nh4 n concentrations were relatively poor r 2 between the measured and predicted concentrations were 0 497 and 0 674 respectively therefore these results validated the high accuracy of the taguchi method to predict outflow water quality under the taguchi design conditions water quality from the other possible structural combinations of green roofs except taguchi designed conditions could also be predicted by using the taguchi method the predicted concentrations of outflow water quality under the optimum combinations of green roofs are listed in table 6 except the ph and no3 parameters concentrations of the other water quality parameters under their optimum conditions were decreased by 10 2 to 77 6 for example under the case of best improvement mean concentration of f under the experimental combinations were ranged from 0 31 mg l to 1 13 mg l and the mean value with the optimal condition was improved to 0 069 mg l the lowest improving effectiveness of ph was 5 45 in addition it was noted that the optimum factors levels of no3 concentration were the same as the designed combinations in the experiments 4 discussion 4 1 overall performances of water quality from green roofs runoff in the current study 51 reduction percentage of the mean no3 concentrations was investigated in the green roof runoff compared with rainwater it indicated a certain purify effect of green roofs on nitrate ion this is consistent with the findings of previous studies that green roofs are a sink for nitrate berndtsson et al 2009 speak et al 2014 except for the ph and no 3 mean concentrations of the other water quality parameters from green roof outflows were all higher than the rainwater input it indicated that the studied green roofs acted as a source of most of the runoff pollutants in the present study due to the rainwater is relatively pure outflow runoff pollution caused by the green roof is remarkable the results were aligned with the investigation by zhang et al 2015b in that green roofs significantly increased the concentrations of runoff pollutants including f cl nh4 n and no2 n it was noted that the mean ec value increased from 295 17 μs cm in rainwater to 418 33 μs cm in green roof outflows as a result of the increase in dissolved ion content green roofs elevated the concentration of anions and cations in outflows it probably derived from the substrate materials by rainwater leaching consistently rainfall leachate effects on green roofs were also investigated by john et al 2017 and teemusk and mander 2007 in effect substrate materials can act as the ion exchange filter for runoff pollutants if the ion concentration in rainwater is lower than that of the green roof substrate some ions will seep into the rainwater from the substrate although the overall performance of runoff water quality was partly considered to be good runoff with elevated ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen is of concern as it will potentially cause eutrophication of urban surface water therefore the risk of runoff pollution form green roof outflows needed to be cautiously addressed and controlled 4 2 influences of structural factors on water quality of green roof runoff 4 2 1 composition of substrate materials in this study substrate s2 consisted of peat soil and pine needle has a high nutrient content resulted in higher esp no3 and no2 n concentrations in runoff from substrate s2 than s1 in general substrate component materials contain nutrients that could contribute to rainwater leaching occurred from the substrate dusza et al 2017 liu et al 2019b investigated that substrate significantly impact stormwater runoff quality of extensive green roofs the chemical substances in the substrate were washed out into the outflow thus the substrate materials played a critical role in water quality of green roof outflow harper et al 2015 gong et al 2019 moran et al 2003 pointed out that nitrogen and phosphorus amounts in green roof outflow were directly related to the organic matter content in the substrate akther et al 2021 concluded that substrate was the primary source for nutrients leached however organic rich substrate not only raised the availability of nutrients to plants but also lead to high leaching rates of nitrogen beecham and razzaghmanesh 2015 rowe et al 2006 nagase and dunnett 2011 investigated that the decomposing peat was considered inappropriate for substrate materials of green roofs thus the desirable substrates for green roofs would possess high sorption capacity and consist of less rich organic matter moreover recent studies from gong et al 2020 and vijayaraghavan et al 2019 reported that the pollutant purification effect of green roofs can be improved by optimizing the composition of substrate materials 4 2 2 depths of substrate in the present study results showed that the mean ec esp cl tn and no2 n concentrations in green roofs runoff were raised as the substrate depths increased from 5 cm to 15 cm and the pollutants were readily leached out from the thicker substrates this trend was aligned with the seidl et al 2013 and gong et al 2020 that deeper substrates can result in higher nitrogen leaching an explanation is that when the substrate depth was deeper substrate background contained more nutrients thus nutrients were more prone to being leached from the green roof shallower substrate will have lower runoff retention capacity and allows pollutants to pass quickly into outflow runoff berndtsson et al 2009 however the role of substrate depth in runoff water quality is less consistent conversely denardo et al 2005 and berndtsson et al 2006 concluded that deeper substrates may increase the duration of runoff retention allowing increased the levels of adsorption or chemical dissolution reaction resulting in a decrease of pollutants content in the green roof runoff 4 2 3 vegetation types in the current study green roof planted with sedum spectabile had the highest and radix ophiopogonis green roof had the lowest ec cl so4 no3 tp and no2 n concentrations the results were similar to the findings of john et al 2017 in that green roof planted with sedum released more nutrients into outflow runoff the role of plant uptake on runoff pollutants from green roof would be plant species dependent monterusso 2004 investigated that plants with higher nutrient demands and transpiration rates can retain more runoff pollutants however vegetation usually has positive and negative functions on runoff water quality of green roofs on one hand plants can absorb and metabolize pollutants in the substrate in this study the vegetated green roof had significantly lower esp f cl no 3 tn and no2 n concentrations in outflows than the bare green roof which is similar to the results reported by beecham and razzaghmanesh 2015 speak et al 2014 and vijayaraghavan and joshi 2014 these studies highlighted the possibility of water quality improvement through vegetation effect on the other hand nutrient content of the substrate will be changed by the decomposition of fallen leaves and regenerated roots of plants and metabolites of substrate soil microbial processes all of which will increase pollutants source in green roof outflow dusza et al 2017 sutton and lambrinos 2015 aitkenhead peterson et al 2011 indicated that there was higher leachate of nitrogen from a green roof planted with sedum than from the bare substrate however most of nutrient loss in the substrate results from rainwater leaching was larger than biodegradation effect in addition the lack of adequate characterization of growing vegetation challenges the quantitative investigation of the role of vegetation on runoff water quality 4 3 advantages of taguchi method to investigate the impacts of structural factors on outflow water quality of green roofs many laboratories and field experiments have been conducted under various structural combinations berndtsson 2010 vijayaraghavan et al 2019 nevertheless the number of experimental combinations exponentially grows with the number of factors and their levels increased smucker et al 2018 thus it is time consuming and costly to run for tests box et al 2005 the taguchi method is economical and efficient because it requires a minimum number of experimental tests and meanwhile its conclusions are associated with statistical levels of confidence taguchi 1990 in this study simulation results validated the high accuracy of the taguchi method to predict outflow water quality under the structural combinations with taguchi design in this case taguchi method can be used to accurately predict water quality within a study area given limited experimental conditions and without having to commit to a large amount of work liu et al 2019c examined the ability of the taguchi method to predict runoff retention at small sized plot scale with an acceptable level of accuracy zhang et al 2021 suggested that the soil erosion results obtained from the taguchi method were much closer than those obtained from a full factorial design at the slope scale sadeghi et al 2012 concluded that the taguchi method obtained reliable experimental conclusions without losing valuable information to some extent it could act as a substitute for the full factorial design therefore the taguchi method would be a reliable and economical method to optimize and predict outflow water quality of green roofs in response to different combinations of the designed factors and application levels 5 conclusions the present study assessed the influences of structural factors on water quality of green roof runoff and applied taguchi method for optimizing assembled combinations and predicting outflow water quality the results showed that green roofs acted as a source of most of the studied water quality parameters moreover the majority of water quality parameters of green roof outflows fell into the class iii water quality standard therefore it was concluded that the overall performance of runoff water quality from green roofs was partly considered to be good substrate materials and vegetation types contributed notably to water quality of green roof outflows moreover green roofs with less organic materials in the substrate showed better water quality green roofs planted with radix ophiopogonis had the lowest water quality concentrations vegetated green roof had significantly lower water quality concentrations than bare substrate pollutants were readily leached into outflow runoff from green roofs through the thicker substrate the influences of substrate depths and slope gradients on runoff water quality were small the taguchi method was successfully applied for optimizing the assembled combinations of green roofs for improving each water quality parameter it also validated that the taguchi method had a reliable accuracy to predict outflow water quality of green roofs in summary in order to mitigate runoff pollution risk from green roofs on urban water environment two aspects should be carefully considered first green roof system should be designed with an appropriate selection of substrate material composition and scientific screening of plant species second there is a need to determine the optimum assembly combinations of green roofs under some specific design conditions to improve outflow water quality prior to installation meanwhile the taguchi method was validated to be a simple and reliable method

4947,bioremediation of groundwater is a widely applied method for remediation of contaminated groundwater microbial growth and biogenic gas accumulation are common during anaerobic bioremediation these two processes can alter groundwater flow patterns and affect the ability to deliver electron donors or acceptors to target zones through changes in subsurface permeability porosity and dispersivity in this study we analyzed three tracer tests conducted in an anaerobic two dimensional sand filled cell inoculated with a methanogenic culture the ability of models to predict changes in porosity permeability and dispersivity during microbial growth and methane generation were evaluated microbial growth increased spatially averaged dispersivity by a ratio of 1 67 biomass growth coupled with biogenic gas increased the spatially averaged dispersivity by a ratio of 2 46 in contrast with biomass measurements from confocal laser scanning microscopy the model of taylor and jaffe 1990b predicted a dispersivity increase by a factor of 10 1300 for water saturations greater than 0 5 the model of sato et al 2003 provided estimates of the effect of gas on dispersivity similar to values fit from modelling of the tracer tests keywords biofilm biogenic gas dispersivity anaerobic biodegradation porous media numerical simulation 1 introduction microbial growth and generation of biogenic gas are often encountered during the in situ bioremediation of contaminated aquifers baveye et al 1998 major et al 2002 xia et al 2014 2016 qiao et al 2018 levakov et al 2019 many experimental studies of bioremediation have reported significant biomass growth and gas generation in porous media seki et al 1998 sleep et al 2006 ye et al 2009 and changes in soil properties kone et al 2014 baveye and laba 2015 the reduction in permeability with biomass growth has been well studied and reviewed in the literature baveye et al 1998 thullner 2010 hommel et al 2018 as discussed in baveye and valocchi 1989 the distribution of microorganisms in porous media has been characterized in three different ways 1 with a macroscopic approach in which no assumptions are made about the morphology of the microbial population 2 assuming microbial growth in discrete micro colonies and 3 assuming the development of a biofilm with a uniform thickness each of these approaches leads to different models to describe the relationship between hydrodynamic parameters and microbial growth the model of clement et al 1996 using the macroscopic approach relates changes in porosity and permeability to macroscopic solid phase concentrations of biomass the micro colony approach needs characterization of micro colony nonuniform distribution and has been mostly used for pore scale research vandevivere 1995 dupin and mccarty 2000 deng et al 2013 rosenzweig et al 2014 thullner et al 2002 developed a pore network model for flow transport with microbial growth based on micro colonies and on biofilm formation they found that the micro colony approach provided a better match to experimental data on the effect of microbial growth on permeability seifert and engesgaard 2007 2012 also found that the model of thullner et al 2002 provided the best fit to their data on permeability reductions with biomass growth taylor s model of permeability tmp assumes microbes are present in a biofilm and relates changes in the permeability to changes in biofilm thickness taylor et al 1990 taylor and jaffe 1990a van noorden et al 2010 schulz and knabner 2017 some upscaled models for biofilm growth have been developed from pore scale models and compared to the tmp model providing support for the tmp model van noorden et al 2010 schulz and knabner 2017 experimental validation of the tmp model beyond model calibration is difficult due to challenge of confirming the presence of a biofilm and measuring the biofilm thickness ye et al 2009 conducted a sand box experiment with an anaerobic microbial culture to investigate the effects of biomass growth and gas generation on water flow in porous media the thickness of microbial growth on individual sand grains investigated with confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was very uneven for each individual sand grain the measurements followed a normal distribution with means across the sand grains analyzed ranging from 59 to 316

pore network model found that the dispersivity is strongly dependent on saturation with a nonmonotonic relationship the maximum dispersivity about 10 times that for saturated conditions occurred at a critical saturation s cr between 0 4 and 0 5 the dispersivity increases to a maximum as saturation increases to s cr and then decreases as saturation increases further sato et al 2003 proposed a power

coefficient l3m 1 for the numerical simulation of the three tracer tests the sandbox domain was discretized into 2475 element of size of 1 cm 1 cm fig 2 consistent with the experiment the top and bottom boundaries were no flow boundaries and the left and right sides were fixed flux and fixed head boundaries for flow model respectively for solute transport simulation the left inlet boundary was fixed with a specific concentration the right outlet boundary was set as a flux boundary while the top and bottom sides were no flux boundaries the effluent concentrations from the tracer tests were measured ye et al 2009 and fit by adjusting model parameters assuming homogenous conditions across the sandbox however the biomass levels and gas saturations were not uniformly distributed in the cell during kb 1 growth in the cell fig 1 the spatial changes in permeability and dispersivity during the study were estimated by the tmp and tjmd models the bc model and the sm model respectively in the numerical simulations of the tracer tests 3 results and discussion from the clsm measurements of the thickness of biomass in samples from the sandbox and assuming that these could be used as measures of biofilm thickness in taylor and jaffe s model eq 1 the estimated values of θ b θ 0 ranged from 0 07 to 0 41 with average ratio of 0 18 from modeling of the tracer tests the best fit value of θ b θ 0 was 0 95 indicating only 5 reduction in porosity due to biofilm growth this porosity reduction is similar to that reported by bielefeldt et al 2002 in which the porosity reduction was 3 8 3 1 permeability and dispersivity estimated by tmp and tjmd models the bulk average permeability measured with hydraulic tests for background conditions test t1 and biomass affected conditions test t2 were 3 4 10 6 cm and 4 3 10 7 cm respectively corresponding to a bulk average permeability reduction ratio k b k 0 of 0 13 ye et al 2015 ye et al 2015 found that the thickness of attached biomass followed a normal distribution table 2 shows that the estimated k b k 0 values calculated with the tmp model for the mean l f values ranged from 0 27 10 3 to 51 24 10 3 corresponding an averaged reduction ratio of 0 025 which was about 5 times less than the measured value of 0 13 by the hydraulic tests the estimated k b k 0 values using l f σ were 1 76 10 3 88 78 10 3 corresponding an average of 0 05 which was closer to the experimental value table 2 shows that the predicted increase in dispersivity ratios α b α 0 using l f in the tjmd model were 8 0 244 8 corresponding to an average increase of 50 the estimated α b α 0 values using l f σ were 10 5 1320 3 corresponding an average of 239 3 2 estimation of spatially averaged parameters from tracer tests spatially averaged values of dispersivity were estimated by inverse numerical simulation of the three tracer tests the calibrated average values of dispersivity were 0 45 cm and 0 56 cm for tests t2 and t3 respectively table 3 corresponding to dispersivity increases by factors of 1 67 and 2 07 with only biomass growth and with both biomass growth and biogas generation respectively as shown in fig 3 simulated results match the experimental btcs well indicating that the calibrated average values of parameters approximated the average properties of the porous media in the 2d cell the calibrated values of dispersivity were much less than those estimated by the tjmd model for all l f values while the tmp model predicted permeability reductions consistent with experimental measurements the tjmd model predicted 30 143 times larger dispersivity change than the calibrated value from simulation of the btcs of tests t1 and t2 the peaks in tracer concentration are similar for t1 and t2 with a slightly later breakthrough for t2 compare to t1 a lower peak concentration with t2 and more tailing with t2 compared to t1 the average porosity was reduced by about 5 between t1 and t2 due to biomass growth for t2 which would cause earlier breakthrough the later breakthrough in t2 may be related to kinetic sorption of the tracer to biomass extracellular polymeric substances eps or diffusion of tracer into and out of biofilm or bio colonies this would lower peak concentrations and produce tailing beyond the effects of increased dispersivity 3 3 spatial variability of parameters the clsm measurements and the visualization of gas generation indicated significant spatial variability in biomass growth and changes in gas phase saturation kriging was used to interpolate parameter values across the sandbox domain to establish a 2d spatial distribution of parameters conditioned on measured values illman et al 2012 light intensity images continuously taken by the ccd camera were used to compare the difference between experimental and simulated results tests t1 and t2 in the absence of direct measurement of sorption variability sorption parameters were assumed to be uniform over the simulation domain as in the homogenous simulations parameter values in table 3 for the t1 simulation the sand in the cell was considered homogeneous and the calibrated dispersivity was 0 27 cm as a background condition without biofilm and gases the simulated solute front was nearly vertical and matched the ccd image well fig 4 a c the minor difference of the two fronts at the bottom of sandbox could be attributed to nonideal sand packing 3 3 1 biofilm induced heterogeneity for test t2 the existence of biomass introduced heterogeneity into the system influencing flow and solute transport since flow can bypass areas with lower hydraulic conductivity in a two dimensional cell the spatial heterogeneity of media in the sandbox induced by nonuniformly distributed biomass is not well represented by one average value the heterogeneous permeability field was obtained through interpolation of 7 sample data shown in table 2 which were used to set the permeability field for the t2 simulation fig 5 a the distribution of dispersivity was determined by fitting the model to the btcs and the solute fronts from ccd camera images during the tracer tests as shown in fig 5b the range of calibrated dispersivity is 0 27 0 70 cm corresponding to an increase in the ratio of 1 00 2 59 with an average of 1 67 fig 4 shows that the simulated solute fronts matched the ccd images well significant biomass growth at the bottom of the sandbox fig 1 hindered the solute transport as shown both in ccd image fig 4b and simulated results fig 4d the biomass growth in the area about 5 20 cm above the bottom of the cell was lower fig 1 so that the permeability reduction was less allowing faster migration of the solute front fig 4b d the calibrated dispersivity ratio increase of 1 00 2 59 in this study is close to the previous studies which demonstrated increases of an order of magnitude seifert and engesgaard 2007 kone et al 2014 in 1d columns the values of α b α 0 estimated by the tjmd model using l f σ ranged from 10 to 1300 with average of 239 significantly overestimating the effect of biomass growth on dispersivity in a 2d system 3 3 2 biofilm and gas induced heterogeneity tracer test t3 involves both biomass growth and biogenic gas generation the initial water saturation monitored by ccd camera before test t3 is shown in fig 6 a the bc model predicted a permeability decrease ranging from 0 05 to 1 with water saturation varying from 0 5 to 1 based on the permeability change estimated by the tmp model and combining that with the change calculated with the bc model the permeability reduction induced by both biofilm and gases was 1 76 10 3 0 07 with an average of 0 023 fig 6b in the heterogeneous simulation the sm model predicted an increase in the dispersivity α g α 0 ranging between 1 and 5 with water saturation varying from 0 5 to 1 cherrey et al 2003 and raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 showed that the dispersivity may have an order of magnitude variability with water saturations ranging from 0 2 to 1 0 with the initial water saturation great than 0 5 fig 6a the negative relationship between dispersivity and saturation in the sm model is similar to the previous studies cherrey et al 2003 raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 in order to distinguish the impact of both biomass and gases from that of only biomass two sets of dispersivity increase were tried for simulation of test t3 first dispersivity was calibrated from simulation of test t2 only biomass growth with water saturation of unity fig 5b the additional effect of the gas phase and reduced water saturation was estimated by applying the sm model to this dispersivity fig 6c the dispersivity estimate increases caused by both biofilm and biogas range from 1 to 5 8 across the domain with an average of 2 46 corresponding average water saturation of 0 83 in this study the simulated btcs for tests t2 sim t2 and t3 sim t3 1 and sim t3 2 using the first and second sets of dispersivity values respectively with heterogeneous parameters fit the experimental btcs relatively well especially matching the peak concentrations fig 7 however the simulated btcs have earlier breakthrough and do not show significant tailing the tailing is particularly evident in the t3 experimental data this may be due to greater heterogeneity in permeability in the experiment with gas generation than in the corresponding simulations that were based on a sparse set of measurements the presence of more lower permeability regions due to gas blockage of water flow could create both earlier breakthrough due to bypassing of these zones and later tailing due to diffusion out of these zones 4 conclusions over the range of biomass growth examined in this study the tmp model predicted permeability reductions within a factor of 0 05 determined experimentally combining the tmp model with the bc model provided a factor of 0 023 fit to reductions in permeability with both biomass growth and gas generation for the two dimensional experiments in this study the tjmd model significantly over estimated the impact of biofilm growth impact on dispersivity determined from modeling of tracer tests especially for cases with signficiant biomass growth the sm model provided a reasonable estimate of the impact of increases in gas phase saturation on dispersivity especially for water saturations greater than 0 5 the impacts of biomass growth and both biomass growth and biogenic gas generation on the dispersivity of porous media during anaerobic biodegradation were limited which increases in dispersivity by factors of 1 67 and 2 46 respectively in contrast to changes in permeability the changes in dispersivity are of less significance with respect to the impact of biomass growth and gas generation on

4947,bioremediation of groundwater is a widely applied method for remediation of contaminated groundwater microbial growth and biogenic gas accumulation are common during anaerobic bioremediation these two processes can alter groundwater flow patterns and affect the ability to deliver electron donors or acceptors to target zones through changes in subsurface permeability porosity and dispersivity in this study we analyzed three tracer tests conducted in an anaerobic two dimensional sand filled cell inoculated with a methanogenic culture the ability of models to predict changes in porosity permeability and dispersivity during microbial growth and methane generation were evaluated microbial growth increased spatially averaged dispersivity by a ratio of 1 67 biomass growth coupled with biogenic gas increased the spatially averaged dispersivity by a ratio of 2 46 in contrast with biomass measurements from confocal laser scanning microscopy the model of taylor and jaffe 1990b predicted a dispersivity increase by a factor of 10 1300 for water saturations greater than 0 5 the model of sato et al 2003 provided estimates of the effect of gas on dispersivity similar to

experimental studies of bioremediation have reported significant biomass growth and gas generation in porous media seki et al 1998 sleep et al 2006 ye et al 2009 and changes in soil properties kone et al 2014 baveye and laba 2015 the reduction in permeability with biomass growth has been well studied and reviewed in the literature baveye et al 1998 thullner 2010 hommel et al 2018 as discussed in baveye and valocchi 1989 the distribution of microorganisms in porous media has been characterized in three different ways 1 with a macroscopic approach in which no assumptions are made about the morphology of the microbial population 2 assuming microbial growth in discrete micro colonies and 3 assuming the development of a biofilm with a uniform thickness each of these approaches leads to different models to describe the relationship between hydrodynamic parameters and microbial growth the model of clement et al 1996 using the macroscopic approach relates changes in porosity and permeability to macroscopic solid phase concentrations of biomass the micro colony approach needs characterization of micro colony nonuniform distribution and has been mostly used for pore scale research vandevivere 1995 dupin and mccarty 2000 deng et al 2013 rosenzweig et al 2014 thullner et al 2002 developed a pore network model for flow transport with microbial growth based on micro colonies and on biofilm formation they found that the micro colony approach provided a better match to experimental data on the effect of microbial growth on permeability seifert and engesgaard 2007 2012 also found that the model of thullner et al 2002 provided the best fit to their data on permeability reductions with biomass growth taylor s model of permeability tmp assumes microbes are present in a biofilm and relates changes in the permeability to changes in biofilm thickness taylor et al 1990 taylor and jaffe 1990a van noorden et al 2010 schulz and knabner 2017 some upscaled models for biofilm growth have been developed from pore scale models and compared to the tmp model providing support for the tmp model van noorden et al 2010 schulz and knabner 2017 experimental validation of the tmp model beyond model calibration is difficult due to challenge of confirming the presence of a biofilm and measuring the biofilm thickness ye et al 2009 conducted a sand box experiment with an anaerobic microbial culture to investigate the effects of biomass growth and gas generation on water flow in porous media the thickness of microbial growth on individual sand grains investigated with confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was very uneven for each individual sand grain the measurements followed a normal distribution with means across the sand grains analyzed ranging from 59 to 316

bottom boundaries were no flow boundaries and the left and right sides were fixed flux and fixed head boundaries for flow model respectively for solute transport simulation the left inlet boundary was fixed with a specific concentration the right outlet boundary was set as a flux boundary while the top and bottom sides were no flux boundaries the effluent concentrations from the tracer tests were measured ye et al 2009 and fit by adjusting model parameters assuming homogenous conditions across the sandbox however the biomass levels and gas saturations were not uniformly distributed in the cell during kb 1 growth in the cell fig 1 the spatial changes in permeability and dispersivity during the study were estimated by the tmp and tjmd models the bc model and the sm model respectively in the numerical simulations of the tracer tests 3 results and discussion from the clsm measurements of the thickness of biomass in samples from the sandbox and assuming that these could be used as measures of biofilm thickness in taylor and jaffe s model eq 1 the estimated values of θ b θ 0 ranged from 0 07 to 0 41 with average ratio of 0 18 from modeling of the tracer tests the best fit value of θ b θ 0 was 0 95 indicating only 5 reduction in porosity due to biofilm growth this porosity reduction is similar to that reported by bielefeldt et al 2002 in which the porosity reduction was 3 8 3 1 permeability and dispersivity estimated by tmp and tjmd models the bulk average permeability measured with hydraulic tests for background conditions test t1 and biomass affected conditions test t2 were 3 4 10 6 cm and 4 3 10 7 cm respectively corresponding to a bulk average permeability reduction ratio k b k 0 of 0 13 ye et al 2015 ye et al 2015 found that the thickness of attached biomass followed a normal distribution table 2 shows that the estimated k b k 0 values calculated with the tmp model for the mean l f values ranged from 0 27 10 3 to 51 24 10 3 corresponding an averaged reduction ratio of 0 025 which was about 5 times less than the measured value of 0 13 by the hydraulic tests the estimated k b k 0 values using l f σ were 1 76 10 3 88 78 10 3 corresponding an average of 0 05 which was closer to the experimental value table 2 shows that the predicted increase in dispersivity ratios α b α 0 using l f in the tjmd model were 8 0 244 8 corresponding to an average increase of 50 the estimated α b α 0 values using l f σ were 10 5 1320 3 corresponding an average of 239 3 2 estimation of spatially averaged parameters from tracer tests spatially averaged values of dispersivity were estimated by inverse numerical simulation of the three tracer tests the calibrated average values of dispersivity were 0 45 cm and 0 56 cm for tests t2 and t3 respectively table 3 corresponding to dispersivity increases by factors of 1 67 and 2 07 with only biomass growth and with both biomass growth and biogas generation respectively as shown in fig 3 simulated results match the experimental btcs well indicating that the calibrated average values of parameters approximated the average properties of the porous media in the 2d cell the calibrated values of dispersivity were much less than those estimated by the tjmd model for all l f values while the tmp model predicted permeability reductions consistent with experimental measurements the tjmd model predicted 30 143 times larger dispersivity change than the calibrated value from simulation of the btcs of tests t1 and t2 the peaks in tracer concentration are similar for t1 and t2 with a slightly later breakthrough for t2 compare to t1 a lower peak concentration with t2 and more tailing with t2 compared to t1 the average porosity was reduced by about 5 between t1 and t2 due to biomass growth for t2 which would cause earlier breakthrough the later breakthrough in t2 may be related to kinetic sorption of the tracer to biomass extracellular polymeric substances eps or diffusion of tracer into and out of biofilm or bio colonies this would lower peak concentrations and produce tailing beyond the effects of increased dispersivity 3 3 spatial variability of parameters the clsm measurements and the visualization of gas generation indicated significant spatial variability in biomass growth and changes in gas phase saturation kriging was used to interpolate parameter values across the sandbox domain to establish a 2d spatial distribution of parameters conditioned on measured values illman et al 2012 light intensity images continuously taken by the ccd camera were used to compare the difference between experimental and simulated results tests t1 and t2 in the absence of direct measurement of sorption variability sorption parameters were assumed to be uniform over the simulation domain as in the homogenous simulations parameter values in table 3 for the t1 simulation the sand in the cell was considered homogeneous and the calibrated dispersivity was 0 27 cm as a background condition without biofilm and gases the simulated solute front was nearly vertical and matched the ccd image well fig 4 a c the minor difference of the two fronts at the bottom of sandbox could be attributed to nonideal sand packing 3 3 1 biofilm induced heterogeneity for test t2 the existence of biomass introduced heterogeneity into the system influencing flow and solute transport since flow can bypass areas with lower hydraulic conductivity in a two dimensional cell the spatial heterogeneity of media in the sandbox induced by nonuniformly distributed biomass is not well represented by one average value the heterogeneous permeability field was obtained through interpolation of 7 sample data shown in table 2 which were used to set the permeability field for the t2 simulation fig 5 a the distribution of dispersivity was determined by fitting the model to the btcs and the solute fronts from ccd camera images during the tracer tests as shown in fig 5b the range of calibrated dispersivity is 0 27 0 70 cm corresponding to an increase in the ratio of 1 00 2 59 with an average of 1 67 fig 4 shows that the simulated solute fronts matched the ccd images well significant biomass growth at the bottom of the sandbox fig 1 hindered the solute transport as shown both in ccd image fig 4b and simulated results fig 4d the biomass growth in the area about 5 20 cm above the bottom of the cell was lower fig 1 so that the permeability reduction was less allowing faster migration of the solute front fig 4b d the calibrated dispersivity ratio increase of 1 00 2 59 in this study is close to the previous studies which demonstrated increases of an order of magnitude seifert and engesgaard 2007 kone et al 2014 in 1d columns the values of α b α 0 estimated by the tjmd model using l f σ ranged from 10 to 1300 with average of 239 significantly overestimating the effect of biomass growth on dispersivity in a 2d system 3 3 2 biofilm and gas induced heterogeneity tracer test t3 involves both biomass growth and biogenic gas generation the initial water saturation monitored by ccd camera before test t3 is shown in fig 6 a the bc model predicted a permeability decrease ranging from 0 05 to 1 with water saturation varying from 0 5 to 1 based on the permeability change estimated by the tmp model and combining that with the change calculated with the bc model the permeability reduction induced by both biofilm and gases was 1 76 10 3 0 07 with an average of 0 023 fig 6b in the heterogeneous simulation the sm model predicted an increase in the dispersivity α g α 0 ranging between 1 and 5 with water saturation varying from 0 5 to 1 cherrey et al 2003 and raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 showed that the dispersivity may have an order of magnitude variability with water saturations ranging from 0 2 to 1 0 with the initial water saturation great than 0 5 fig 6a the negative relationship between dispersivity and saturation in the sm model is similar to the previous studies cherrey et al 2003 raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 in order to distinguish the impact of both biomass and gases from that of only biomass two sets of dispersivity increase were tried for simulation of test t3 first dispersivity was calibrated from simulation of test t2 only biomass growth with water saturation of unity fig 5b the additional effect of the gas phase and reduced water saturation was estimated by applying the sm model to this dispersivity fig 6c the dispersivity estimate increases caused by both biofilm and biogas range from 1 to 5 8 across the domain with an average of 2 46 corresponding average water saturation of 0 83 in this study the simulated btcs for tests t2 sim t2 and t3 sim t3 1 and sim t3 2 using the first and second sets of dispersivity values respectively with heterogeneous parameters fit the experimental btcs relatively well especially matching the peak concentrations fig 7 however the simulated btcs have earlier breakthrough and do not show significant tailing the tailing is particularly evident in the t3 experimental data this may be due to greater heterogeneity in permeability in the experiment with gas generation than in the corresponding simulations that were based on a sparse set of measurements the presence of more lower permeability regions due to gas blockage of water flow could create both earlier breakthrough due to bypassing of these zones and later tailing due to diffusion out of these zones 4 conclusions over the range of biomass growth examined in this study the tmp model predicted permeability reductions within a factor of 0 05 determined experimentally combining the tmp model with the bc model provided a factor of 0 023 fit to reductions in permeability with both biomass growth and gas generation for the two dimensional experiments in this study the tjmd model significantly over estimated the impact of biofilm growth impact on dispersivity determined from modeling of tracer tests especially for cases with signficiant biomass growth the sm model provided a reasonable estimate of the impact of increases in gas phase saturation on dispersivity especially for water saturations greater than 0 5 the impacts of biomass growth and both biomass growth and biogenic gas generation on the dispersivity of porous media during anaerobic biodegradation were limited which increases in dispersivity by factors of 1 67 and 2 46 respectively in contrast to changes in permeability the changes in dispersivity are of less significance with respect to the impact of biomass growth and gas generation on

4948,we compute seawater intrusion swi in confined aquifers by completely decoupling the actually interacting water flow and salt transport governed by the variable density flow vdf equations key to that new approach is using as solution domain the through flow region of a coastal aquifer bounded below by the interface that fits the separation streamline on which the salinity is set at one half of the sea salinity considering the through flow as unaffected by the salinity salt as tracer yields useful results in a wide range of swi conditions very efficiently we compare through flow uncoupled

α value as indicator the through flow domain uncoupled model is found to be applicable up to at least α 20 versus α 1 for the all domain ps c model the superiority of the uncoupled through flow solution is attributed to excluding the high salinity circulation region near the aquifer s sea boundary and to fitting the 50 salinity contour by the interface corrected for dispersion outflow area and toe penetration the ps c model performs poorly because including that high salinity region where the ps c assumption is weak corrupts the solution throughout the swi area keywords coastal aquifer seawater intrusion variable density flow pseudo coupling decoupling flow and transport groundwater 1 introduction seawater intruding in a coastal aquifer mixes with fresh groundwater this process is controlled by the balance of the engaged opposing forces the intruding action of seawater and the counter action of the inland to coast freshwater flow the mass density of the resulting groundwater mixture depends on the variable salt concentration therefore this interaction of water flow and salt transport is governed by coupled variable density flow vdf equations exact analytical vdf solutions do not exist even henry s 1964 solution of simplified vdf equations is only semi analytical while perturbation solutions dentz et al 2006 are very restrictive although the vdf equations can be integrated numerically on present day personal computers as is indeed done for certain studies such simulations are demanding especially when the so called mixing zone is narrow as a result particularly exploring optimal management for a regional coastal aquifer in a multi dimensional setting remains computationally formidable christelis and mantoglou 2016 in the vastly simpler sharp interface flow sif models the impervious internal flow boundary separating the two immiscible considered fluids allows straightforward solutions even analytical for schematised homogeneous aquifers sif models are thus preferred for screening level analyses e g mazi 2014 mazi et al 2013 2014 2016a b their simplest form is commonly credited to ghyben ghyben and drabbe 1889 and herzberg 1901 and assumes hydrostatics in the flowing fresh groundwater dupuit hypothesis as in the static taken intruded seawater depth integrated sif models are often deemed adequate for first order vulnerability checks of seawater intrusion swi in aquifers provided the mixing zone is thin with the interface as swi indicator however by ignoring mixing these hydraulic sif models cannot provide the salinity distribution required to credibly estimate the risk of aquifer salinization or how endangered a production well is beebe et al 2016 even after interface corrections pool and carrera 2011 koussis et al 2015 koussis and mazi 2018 the vdf and sif approaches thus contrast starkly in ease of use and in predictive capacity the pseudo coupled ps c vdf equations simpson and clement 2003 offer a swi modelling compromise fluid flow and salt transport are coupled only on the sea boundary inside the aquifer the salinity distribution is calculated by neglecting the impact of salinity on the density however ps c solutions hold over a very small range of the parameters controlling vdf here we are seeking a swi model that is modestly complex yet competent over a fairly wide range of conditions to provide the desired insight that sif models lack that alternative model will include mixing but flow and transport will be computed as uncoupled for efficiency treating dissolved salt as a hydro dynamically passive tracer allows calculating swi with constant density transport codes key to this approach is selecting the aquifer s through flow region as solution domain bounded below by the interface that approximates the flow s separation streamline see sub section 2 2 and on which the salinity is set at one half the sea salinity we anticipate this parsimonious model to be useful over a sizeable range of groundwater flow and salt transport conditions encountered in swi field cases in the sequel these conditions are quantified in non dimensional terms 2 materials and methods 2 1

parameter α is defined in the most physically direct manner through the l based scaling that is chosen in this work it is useful to recall here the dimensionless process parameters identified by henry

that he used to model mixing d npd see segol 1994 and relevant references therein these parameters express the same key physics as α and p the coupling of regional and convective flows and the

coupled vdf equations are solved by iterating between the interacting fields of fluid flow and salinity transport adjusting them gradually until they become compatible at some tolerance level considering the flow as unaffected by the solute as knowable from the freshwater hydraulics alone allows solving the tracer transport equation separately single pass solution no flow transport iteration the lower the salinity the closer the approximation to the vdf solution however ps c simulations yield good approximations only for very weak coupling e g α δl δh o 1 dentz et al 2006 that limits the ps c method s applicability drastically key to our approximate swi modelling concept is the use of the interface as flow boundary on which the salinity is prescribed as one half of the sea salinity c s taking the saltwater below it as stagnant replacing the seaside boundary by the corrected interface koussis and mazi 2018 from where dissolved salt at c 0 5c s transverse disperses in the through flow zone was prompted by henry s 1964 observation that the interface approximates the streamline separating the through flow from the circulating flow fig 2 with the salinity in the through flow area c 0 5c s the density contrast above the interface is halved as is the value of the coupling parameter α which should therefore enlarge the application range of the new swi modelling approach ferguson and gleeson 2012 give as average hydraulic gradient for unconfined coastal aquifers in the usa 10 2 10 3 in over 75 of cases walther et al 2017 use 0 5 10 3 0 5 10 2 as range of hydraulic gradients taking δh o l 10 3 and the average ocean salinity i e δ o s 1 40 eq 8 yields α 10 however in the through flow domain maximum salinity is 0 5c s δ 1 80 so α 5 and coupling is actually weaker moreover the permissible salinity limits for various water uses are well under c s 2 17 500 ppm tds 500 ppm tds for drinking water 1500 ppm tds for irrigation water and few thousands ppm tds for desalting brackish groundwater masters 1991 e g when swi is controlled by artificial recharge georgopoulou et al 2001 koussis et al 2010a b including treated wastewater e g gonzalez serrano et al 2005 working in the through flow domain bypasses the circulation cell of high salinity groundwater near the coast fig 2 cooper 1964 in henry s compact aquifer geometry ξ 0 5 and at strong diffusive mixing p d 10 that cell forms already for α 1 but ps c models fail to reproduce it well e g the 50 salinity lines of the pseudo and the fully coupled solutions agree well only for very weak coupling α 1 dentz et al 2006 simpson and clement 2003 similar discrepancies appear also in henry s problem with velocity dependent dispersion abarca et al 2007 good estimation of the interface is therefore essential for using it as boundary e g in the typical swi conditions 5 α 50 an uncorrected interface overestimates swi inherently it is too shallow intersecting the aquifer base too far inland and substantially for certain values of ξ α p and rα koussis and mazi 2018 this overestimation is due to ignoring the mixing of seawater with fresh groundwater promoted by the circulation convecting saltwater from the seafloor to the mixing zone saltwater returning from there to the sea supplies along its path the mixing zone with dissolved salt that disperses across that zone into the freshwater region the energy loss of this convective saltwater flow causes the nominal interface 50 salinity line to retreat seaward cooper 1964 henry 1964 p c82 pool and carrera 2011 however the interface can be estimated adequately by correcting for transverse dispersion pool and carrera 2011 finite outflow area koussis et al 2015 and reduced toe penetration all dependent on ξ α p and rd koussis and mazi 2018 and appendix ii 2 2 1 proof of concept we reiterate our postulate that approximate swi modelling improves when the circulation region of high salinity groundwater is bypassed by using as boundary the interface where salinity c c s 2 with its outflow gap where c x 0 fundamental to this hypothesis is that the position of the equivalent sharp interface approximately separates the streamlines of the through flow that originate at the freshwater end of the aquifer from those of the circulating flow that originate at the ocean end henry 1964 and fig 34a fig 2 here see also fig 4 in walther et al 2017 in pseudo coupling the right hand sides of eqs 2b and 3b are zero as under constant density status flow and transport are thus decoupled inside the aquifer but remain coupled on the sea boundary in contrast flow and transport may be approximated as entirely uncoupled if the high salinity aquifer region is bypassed to this end we replace the sea boundary by the interface with outflow gap through which brackish groundwater exits to the sea by advection c x 0 imposed at x 0 glover s 1959 analytical swi solution can be applied to approximate through flow in constant flow confined aquifers and van der veer s 1977 analytical solution for unconfined aquifers with recharge both aquifers considered infinitely deep the through flow interface zone must be calculated numerically in irregular aquifer geometries and if the head gradients are small specific discharges should be computed via the streamfunction frind and matanga 1985 with the through flow velocities known salinities can be computed with a tracer transport code we compare vdf ps c and uncoupled solutions all calculated with feflow diersch 2006a 2006b for henry s problem swi in a 2 d confined horizontal coastal aquifer with top confining layer at sea level fig 1 with δzs 0 at constant regional flow q in vdf mode steady state is approached asymptotically the ps c and uncoupled solutions are calculated at steady state the seaward boundary is for the ps c model the aquifer s coastal end flow in the entire aquifer cross section and for the uncoupled model the interface through flow area the interface

k ½ the interface is by definition impervious a streamline therefore the flow condition is zero flux i e h n 0 where n is normal to the interface curve the alternative of specifying the freshwater head on the interface is inferior to the exact no flux condition because the freshwater head is derived by invoking the dupuit assumption which implies hydrostatic pressure and thus vertical equipotentials such approximations are not necessary with the zero flux condition the freshwater head on the outflow gap remains to be defined we recall eq a17 appendix ii 20 h δ 2 ζ o 2 2δ q k x ½ which gives h x 0 δ ζ o as freshwater head at the gap but only approximates the vdf hydraulics at the sea boundary writing the hydraulic head h p ρ g z for the seawater ρ ρs h hs and for the freshwater ρ ρf h h and eliminating the pressure between them gives the relation 21 h 1 δ hs δ z at the coastal boundary with the sea surface as datum hs x 0 z 0 while the corresponding equivalent freshwater head h x 0 z δz is variable with the aquifer base as datum hs x 0 z d and h x 0 z 1 δ d δz in contrast the sif solution eq 20 gives h x 0 δ ζ o constant the difference δh x 0 z ζ o δz δ ζ o is small δ ζ o however only h x 0 z ζ o δ ζ o is conceptually consistent with the interface as boundary and shall therefore be used here the sif solutions eqs 19 and 20 are corrected for outflow gap

high salinity region by the uncoupled equations which are used in the ps c model throughout the aquifer interior in contrast the graphs in fig 3 confirm the utility of the interface as boundary concept bypassing the high salinity region moves the solution of the uncoupled equations much closer to the vdf reference results i the corrected interface approximates the 50 salinity line very well

and the width of the transition zone narrows fig 4 displays the streamlines calculated with the vdf equations and with the corrected interface figs 3 and 4 evidently support the premise of the uncoupling methodology whereby the interface separates the flow field in a through flow and in a circulation region and also approximates the 50 salinity line very well 3 seawater intrusion in confined coastal aquifers under field like conditions given the poor performance of the ps c model even for weak coupling α 2 in the following we present only results of the uncoupled model the parameters are as encountered in typical swi field problems slender aquifers ξ 1 regional freshwater flow driven by common overall head gradients α 1 and advection dominated transport large p in all

i e 50 α δ l δh o 5 and péclet numbers 500 p l α l 2000 to ensure accurate results in the feflow simulations we used grid péclet numbers less or equal to 2 mostly 1 as in the mixing zone the salinity distribution and flow field streamlines from a subset of runs are shown in figs 5 7 fig 5 shows swi into a confined coastal aquifer with ξ 0 01 and p 1500 with r d 0 1 under modest to strong coupling conditions α 5 10 25 50 the results in fig 6 depict the sensitivity of swi to the aspect ratio for ξ 0 05 0 01 0 005 under common coupling α 10 and dispersion conditions p 1000 and r d 0 1 the swi results in fig 7 are for a confined aquifer in contact with a sea of average ocean salinity δ 1 40 with fixed aspect ratio ξ 0 01 and fixed regional flow i e fixed coupling parameter α 10 for péclet numbers p 500 1000 1500 2000 and dispersivities ratio r d 0 1 the uncoupled model performs overall quiet well up to approximately α 25 and better the closer the nominal interface fits the separation streamline fig 5 conversely the performance of the model worsens as the nominal interface deviates from the separation streamline this is particularly visible in the case of α 50 despite the good fit of the interface to the 50 salinity contour but even when the interface fits almost perfectly the edge of the 50 salinity contour as for α 10 ξ 0 01 and p 1000 or α 25 ξ 0 01 and p 1500 the uncoupled model under predicts the edges of the lower salinity contours and much more so for larger α here α 25 the results of fig 6 demonstrate the noteworthy fact that under the same hydraulic regime i e α const here α 10 compact confined aquifers larger aspect ratio ξ are more susceptible to swi larger relative distance x d of penetration than slender confined aquifers smaller ξ fig 7 shows that the uncoupled model performs generally competently around the relevant for field applications péclet number o 1000 and in the cases in which the interface fits the 50 salinity contour very well the model performs better at higher péclet numbers compare e g the cases p 1000 vs p 2000 a general observation is that in the tested field like parameter ranges the performance of the uncoupled model vis à vis the vdf standard depends mainly on the coupling parameter α it is most sensitive to the value of α and less affected by variations in the aspect ratio ξ and the péclet number p always r d 0 1 this makes sense since α indicates the strength of coupling a fundamental vdf characteristic that the uncoupled model ignores a few remarks are in order regarding the appropriateness of the sif approximation in assessing the risk of salinization of say a pumping well in an aquifer particularly in the common case of partially penetrating wells for this we examine the thickness of the mixing zone we observe that a in the case p 500 in fig 7 the width of the mixing zone above the interface and ahead of its toe is sizeable about half of the aquifer thickness in this case the information content of the sif model solution is expectedly small since sif assumes zero mixing b however the thickness of the mixing zone also increases when the aquifer is more slender even for larger péclet numbers and modest coupling as seen e g in the case α 10 ξ 0 005 and p 1000 fig 6 and is greater still at stronger coupling as fig 5 shows thus without considering pumping and possible upconing a well penetrating 75 of the aquifer thickness and located at the interface end appears to be safe according to the sif model but reaches an area of 1500 ppm tds salinity finally we add information on the required cpu times for the vdf and the uncoupled interface bounded swi solutions both executed with feflow v 5 3 on a pc equipped with an intel core 2 cpu 6300 at 1 86 ghz running under windows xp professional v 2002 the cpu times depend on the test case characteristics as well as on the flow and transport regimes i e fully transient fully steady or steady flow and transient transport the uncoupled model solution converges under all flow and transport regimes while the vdf model may have to be run in fully transient mode typically for α 10 to reach its solution in the case ξ 0 01 α 10 p 1500 the vdf solution required 3 min 13 s for a transient flow and transport solution and the uncoupled solution took 1 s under steady state flow and transport mode and 9 s under fully transient mode in both cases the number of elements and nodes were approximately the same for comparison in the case ξ 0 01 α 50 p 1500 the vdf model had to be run in fully transient mode and required 48 min in contrast the uncoupled model solution was obtained in fully steady state mode in 5 s using again for comparison about the same number of nodes and elements as the vdf grid and in 2 s using about 40 of the vdf model s nodes and elements solution domain is only the through flow region in the latter case a fully transient uncoupled solution took 20 s 4 conclusions and outlook the comparison of the results of the uncoupled vdf approximation against the coupled vdf reference solutions confirms the premise of our modelling approach namely to use the interface with 50 sea salinity as flow boundary this concept is founded on the observation first made by henry 1964 that the interface also approximates the streamline separating the through flow region from the circulation region these conditions are met more closely at weaker coupling i e at smaller values of the parameter α the aspect ratio ξ and the péclet number p are secondary factors however accuracy useful for practical work is obtained up to α 20 α 25 interpreted with some tolerance for the typical swi field conditions 0 005 ξ 0 05 500 p 2000 and r d 0 1 this remarkable performance more than twentyfold improvement over the pseudo coupled model limited to the practice irrelevant α 1 is attributed to two reasons a confining the solution domain in the through flow region where advective transport is only seaward and the salinity varies from zero at the freshwater inflow section to 50 of sea salinity c s 2 17 500 ppm tds on the interface effectively halves the values of the density contrast δ and thus of the coupling parameter α and b using the interface as boundary on which c c s 2 enables starting the transport solution quite accurately past the high salinity region near the sea boundary where the ps c model performs inherently poorly we reiterate that the permissible salinity limits for various water uses are well under c s 2 the uncoupled interface bounded vdf approximation affords very significant computational gains vis à vis the fully coupled vdf equations and yields the salinity field that sif models are unable to deliver the division of the swi field in a freshwater region and a salty wedge via the sif model while leading analytically to some useful insights in the problem of swi into aquifers is not satisfactory for anything other than a preliminary survey of a regional aquifer s salinization risk unless the transition zone is truly thin applications at smaller scales are more questionable still e g beebe et al 2016 found that strack s analytical sif model predicted swi at an individual well correctly simply a yes or no answer based on a certain salinity threshold in just 59 of the 78 wells studied on the other hand the uncoupled model can estimate the essential for swi risk assessment salinity distribution competently and efficiently up to α 25 using standard groundwater flow and transport codes instead of carrying out tedious calculations with complex vdf simulation software the uncoupled interface bounded vdf approximation is then a parsimonious alternative to the fully coupled vdf model for at least α 20 in fact the uncoupled model could be also used for the purpose of rapidly gaining deeper insights into the swi response behaviour of confined aquifers under a variety of forcing and physical conditions that could even lead to instability when so called tipping points are crossed mazi et al 2013 furthermore the above advantages open up a wide field of computationally demanding swi modelling applications for which the effort for solving the coupled vdf equations would be prohibitive stochastic analysis is a prime example of an approach for which the uncoupled model would be particularly suitable one could execute efficiently multiple runs e g in the framework of monte carlo simulations to assess management alternatives with swi control options hussain et al 2020 of intensively developed regional coastal aquifers yet the uncoupled model would be also useful in the well established in hydrogeological praxis deterministic sensitivity analyses such analyses require evaluating the salinity field in an aquifer repeatedly for a range of parameter values and forcing scenarios our future research plans include swi applications of the uncoupled model to stratified confined and unconfined aquifers rathore et al 2020 exploited by a well gallery a line sink see koussis et al 2012 concluding we wish to point out that the vdf streamlines and salinity pattern suggest as conceptual model of swi into an aquifer the hydrologically active through flow zone underlain by a groundwater reservoir of zero net flow and high salinity that maintains the nominal interface at 50 of sea salinity via flow circulation this conceptual model replaces the

relates the mass densities of pure water ρ w and of the saltwater mixture ρ c linearly with the density of freshwater ρf a4 ρ c ρw c ρf 1 e c e 0 3 inserting this last expression in the compact form of eq a2 ρ w q 0 and expanding yields a5 q e c s ρ f c c s q 0 as argued by henry 1964 the second term in eq a5 is negligible compared to the first one as c cs 1 at the most and ecs ρf 0 008 for seawater this corresponds to the so called oberbeck boussinesq approximation that ignores density differences except in terms multiplied by the gravitational acceleration vector g therefore eq a5 simplifies to the equation of continuity a6 q 0 according to the expanded form of eq a2 the mean steady flow vector is then approximately orthogonal to the density gradient q ρ w 0 dentz et al 2006 next inserting in darcy law eq a1 the freshwater head h p ρ f g z and the constitutive relationship ρ ρ f 1 δ c c s derived from δ eq 2 and ρ from eq a4 gives a7 q k h 1 z δ c c s k k ρ f g μ where 1

empirical correction relationships introduced in koussis and mazi 2018 these relationships are derived from detailed systematic swi simulation tests over the ranges of the dimensionless parameters 0 05 ξ d l 0 005 5 α δ l δh o 50 and 500 p l α l 2000 the new ξ values extend the range of aspect ratios to d l 0 05 while the péclet numbers now include p 500 and reach 2000 previously p 1000 2000 because this four fold variation towards low péclet numbers has some impact furthermore the new test simulations considered α values no higher than 50 δ δh o l strong coupling because beyond α 50 the impact of density contrast is so large as to prohibit using uncoupled equations even if the interface may approximate the 50 salinity line acceptably the vertical finite outflow gap is estimated here by also including the influence of ξ as a12 ζ o d 0 3515 α 0 905 ξ 0 2 r2 0 967 as in our previous work koussis and maz i 2018 we adopt the form of the correction of pool and carrera 2011 but with a variable exponent m instead of the original fixed value m 1 6 a13 δ δ 1 α t d m this important correction modifies the relative density difference δ to approximately account for the transverse

the interface curvature is generally variable the m value depends mainly on α and varies slowly with ξ and little with p small range the present study also includes the influence of the péclet number

4948,we compute seawater intrusion swi in confined aquifers by completely decoupling the actually interacting water flow and salt transport governed by the variable density flow vdf equations key to that new approach is using as solution domain the through flow region of a coastal aquifer bounded below by the interface that fits the separation streamline on which the salinity is set at one half of the sea salinity considering the through flow as unaffected by the salinity salt as tracer yields useful results in a wide range of swi conditions very efficiently we compare through flow uncoupled

α value as indicator the through flow domain uncoupled model is found to be applicable up to at least α 20 versus α 1 for the all domain ps c model the superiority of the uncoupled through flow solution is attributed to excluding the high salinity circulation region near the aquifer s sea boundary and to fitting the 50 salinity contour by the interface corrected for dispersion outflow area and toe penetration the ps c model performs poorly because including that high salinity region where the ps c assumption is weak corrupts the solution throughout the swi area keywords coastal aquifer seawater intrusion variable density flow pseudo coupling decoupling flow and transport groundwater 1 introduction seawater intruding in a coastal aquifer mixes with fresh groundwater this process is controlled by the balance of the engaged opposing forces the intruding action of seawater and the counter action of the inland to coast freshwater flow the mass density of the resulting groundwater mixture depends on the variable salt concentration therefore this interaction of water flow and salt transport is governed by coupled variable density flow vdf equations exact analytical vdf solutions do not exist even henry s 1964 solution of simplified vdf equations is only semi analytical while perturbation solutions dentz et al 2006 are very restrictive although the vdf equations can be integrated numerically on present day personal computers as is indeed done for certain studies such simulations are demanding especially when the so called mixing zone is narrow as a result particularly exploring optimal management for a regional coastal aquifer in a multi dimensional setting remains computationally formidable christelis and mantoglou 2016 in the vastly simpler sharp interface flow sif models the impervious internal flow boundary separating the two immiscible considered fluids allows straightforward solutions even analytical for schematised homogeneous aquifers sif models are thus preferred for screening level analyses e g mazi 2014 mazi et al 2013 2014 2016a b their simplest form is commonly credited to ghyben ghyben and drabbe 1889 and herzberg 1901 and assumes hydrostatics in the flowing fresh groundwater dupuit hypothesis as in the static taken intruded seawater depth integrated sif models are often deemed adequate for first order vulnerability checks of seawater intrusion swi in aquifers provided the mixing zone is thin with the interface as swi indicator however by ignoring mixing these hydraulic sif models cannot provide the salinity distribution required to credibly estimate the risk of aquifer salinization or how endangered a production well is beebe et al 2016 even after interface corrections pool and carrera 2011 koussis et al 2015 koussis and mazi 2018 the vdf and sif approaches thus contrast starkly in ease of use and in predictive capacity the pseudo coupled ps c vdf equations simpson and clement 2003 offer a swi modelling compromise fluid flow and salt transport are coupled only on the sea boundary inside the aquifer the salinity distribution is calculated by neglecting the impact of salinity on the density however ps c solutions hold over a very small range of the parameters controlling vdf here we are seeking a swi model that is modestly complex yet competent over a fairly wide range of conditions to provide the desired insight that sif models lack that alternative model will include mixing but flow and transport will be computed as uncoupled for efficiency treating dissolved salt as a hydro dynamically passive tracer allows calculating swi with constant density transport codes key to this approach is selecting the aquifer s through flow region as solution domain bounded below by the interface that approximates the flow s separation streamline see sub section 2 2 and on which the salinity is set at one half the sea salinity we anticipate this parsimonious model to be useful over a sizeable range of groundwater flow and salt transport conditions encountered in swi field cases in the sequel these conditions are quantified in non dimensional terms 2 materials and methods 2 1

well we have scaled lengths with the aquifer length l because through this choice the coupling parameter compares meaningfully the hydraulic gradient δh o l to the relative density excess δ the choice

coupled vdf equations are solved by iterating between the interacting fields of fluid flow and salinity transport adjusting them gradually until they become compatible at some tolerance level considering the flow as unaffected by the solute as knowable from the freshwater hydraulics alone allows solving the tracer transport equation separately single pass solution no flow transport iteration the lower the salinity the closer the approximation to the vdf solution however ps c simulations yield good approximations only for very weak coupling e g α δl δh o 1 dentz et al 2006 that limits the ps c method s applicability drastically key to our approximate swi modelling concept is the use of the interface as flow boundary on which the salinity is prescribed as one half of the sea salinity c s taking the saltwater below it as stagnant replacing the seaside boundary by the corrected interface koussis and mazi 2018 from where dissolved salt at c 0 5c s transverse disperses in the through flow zone was prompted by henry s 1964 observation that the interface approximates the streamline separating the through flow from the circulating flow fig 2 with the salinity in the through

dentz et al 2006 simpson and clement 2003 similar discrepancies appear also in henry s problem with velocity dependent dispersion abarca et al 2007 good estimation of the interface is therefore essential for using it as boundary e g in the typical swi conditions 5 α 50 an uncorrected interface overestimates swi inherently it is too shallow intersecting the aquifer base too far inland and substantially for certain values of ξ α p and rα koussis and mazi 2018 this overestimation is due to ignoring the mixing of seawater with fresh groundwater promoted by the circulation convecting saltwater from the seafloor to the mixing zone saltwater returning from there to the sea supplies along its path the mixing zone with dissolved salt that disperses across that zone into the freshwater region the energy loss of this convective saltwater flow causes the nominal interface 50 salinity line to retreat seaward cooper 1964 henry 1964 p c82 pool and carrera 2011 however the interface can be estimated adequately by correcting for transverse dispersion pool and carrera 2011 finite outflow area koussis et al 2015 and reduced toe penetration all dependent on ξ α p and rd koussis and mazi 2018 and appendix ii 2 2 1 proof of concept we reiterate our postulate that approximate swi modelling improves when the circulation region of high salinity groundwater is bypassed by using as boundary the interface where salinity c c s 2 with its outflow gap where c x 0 fundamental to this hypothesis is that the position of the equivalent sharp interface approximately separates the streamlines of the through flow that originate at the freshwater end of the aquifer from those of the circulating flow that originate at the ocean end henry 1964 and fig 34a fig 2 here see also fig 4 in walther et al 2017 in pseudo coupling the right hand sides of eqs 2b and 3b are zero as under constant density status flow and transport are thus decoupled inside the aquifer but remain coupled on the sea boundary in contrast flow and transport may be approximated as entirely uncoupled if the high salinity aquifer region is bypassed to this end we replace the sea boundary by the interface with outflow gap through which brackish groundwater exits to the sea by advection c x 0 imposed at x 0 glover s 1959 analytical swi solution can be applied to approximate through flow in constant flow confined aquifers and van der veer s 1977 analytical solution for unconfined aquifers with recharge both aquifers considered infinitely deep the through flow interface zone must be calculated numerically in irregular aquifer geometries and if the head gradients are small specific discharges should be computed via the streamfunction frind and matanga 1985 with the through flow velocities known salinities can be computed with a tracer transport code we compare vdf ps c and uncoupled solutions all calculated with feflow diersch 2006a 2006b for henry s problem swi in a 2 d confined horizontal coastal

steady state the seaward boundary is for the ps c model the aquifer s coastal end flow in the entire aquifer cross section and for the uncoupled model the interface through flow area the interface

k ½ the interface is by definition impervious a streamline therefore the flow condition is zero flux i e h n 0 where n is normal to the interface curve the alternative of specifying the freshwater head on the interface is inferior to the exact no flux condition because the freshwater head is derived by invoking the dupuit assumption which implies hydrostatic pressure and thus vertical equipotentials such approximations are not necessary with the zero flux condition the freshwater head on the outflow gap remains to be defined we recall eq a17 appendix ii 20 h δ 2 ζ o 2 2δ q k x ½ which gives h x 0 δ ζ o as freshwater head at the gap but only approximates the vdf hydraulics at the sea boundary writing the hydraulic head h p ρ g z for the seawater ρ ρs h hs and for the freshwater ρ ρf h h and eliminating the pressure between them gives the relation 21 h 1 δ hs δ z at the coastal boundary with the sea surface as datum hs x 0 z 0 while the corresponding equivalent freshwater head h x 0 z δz is variable with the aquifer base as datum hs x 0 z d and h x 0 z 1 δ d δz in contrast the sif solution eq 20 gives h x 0 δ ζ o constant the difference δh x 0 z ζ o δz δ ζ o

mixing e g with p l α l 3 km 4 m 750 fig 3 shows that the ps c model grossly underestimates swi even for weak coupling α 2 this calamity is due to the poor approximation of the vdf equations in the high salinity region by the uncoupled equations which are used in the ps c model throughout the aquifer interior in contrast the graphs in fig 3 confirm the utility of the interface as boundary concept bypassing the high salinity region moves the solution of the uncoupled equations much closer to the vdf reference results i the corrected interface approximates the 50 salinity line very well ii the shape of the salt isopleths resembles that of the vdf curves and iii the solution of the uncoupled equations approaches the vdf results more as the péclet number increases p o 1000 in the field and the width of the transition zone narrows fig 4 displays the streamlines calculated with the vdf equations and with the corrected interface figs 3 and 4 evidently support the premise of the uncoupling methodology whereby the interface separates the flow field in a through flow and in a circulation region and also approximates the 50 salinity line very well 3 seawater intrusion in confined coastal aquifers under field like conditions given the poor performance of the ps c model even for weak coupling α 2 in the following we present only results of the uncoupled model the parameters are as encountered in typical swi field problems slender aquifers ξ 1 regional freshwater flow driven by common overall head gradients α 1 and advection dominated transport large p in all cases δ 0 025 and mixing is by velocity dependent dispersion with dispersivities ratio r d α t α l 0 1 aspect ratios are 0 005 ξ d l 0 05 nominal overall freshwater head gradients 5 10 4 δh o l 5 10 3 i e 50 α δ l δh o 5 and péclet numbers 500 p l α l 2000 to ensure accurate results in the feflow simulations we used grid péclet numbers less or equal to 2 mostly 1 as in the mixing zone the salinity distribution and flow field streamlines from a subset of runs are shown in figs 5 7 fig 5 shows swi into a confined coastal aquifer with ξ 0 01 and p 1500 with r d 0 1 under modest to strong coupling conditions α 5 10 25 50 the results in fig 6 depict the sensitivity of swi to the aspect ratio for ξ 0 05 0 01 0 005 under common coupling α 10 and dispersion conditions p 1000 and r d 0 1 the swi results in fig 7 are for a confined aquifer in contact with a sea of average ocean salinity δ 1 40 with fixed aspect ratio ξ 0 01 and fixed regional flow i e fixed coupling parameter α 10 for péclet numbers p 500 1000 1500 2000 and dispersivities ratio r d 0 1 the uncoupled model performs overall quiet well up to approximately α 25 and better the closer the nominal interface fits the separation streamline fig 5 conversely the performance of the model worsens as the nominal interface deviates from the separation streamline this is particularly visible in the case of α 50 despite the good fit of the interface to the 50 salinity contour but even when the interface fits almost perfectly the edge of the 50 salinity contour as for α 10 ξ 0 01 and p 1000 or α 25 ξ 0 01 and p 1500 the uncoupled model under predicts the edges of the lower salinity contours and much more so for larger α here α 25 the results of fig 6 demonstrate the noteworthy fact that under the same hydraulic regime i e α const here α 10 compact confined aquifers larger aspect ratio ξ are more susceptible to swi larger relative distance x d of penetration than slender confined aquifers smaller ξ fig 7 shows that the uncoupled model performs generally competently around the relevant for field applications péclet number o 1000 and in the cases in which the interface fits the 50 salinity contour very well the model performs better at higher péclet numbers compare e g the cases p 1000 vs p 2000 a general observation is that in the tested field like parameter ranges the performance of the uncoupled model vis à vis the vdf standard depends mainly on the coupling parameter α it is most sensitive to the value of α and less affected by variations in the aspect ratio ξ and the péclet number p always r d 0 1 this makes sense since α indicates the strength of coupling a fundamental vdf characteristic that the uncoupled model ignores a few remarks are in order regarding the appropriateness of the sif approximation in assessing the risk of salinization of say a pumping well in an aquifer particularly in the common case of partially penetrating wells for this we examine the thickness of the mixing zone we observe that a in the case p 500 in fig 7 the width of the mixing zone above the interface and ahead of its toe is sizeable about half of the aquifer thickness in this case the information content of the sif model solution is expectedly small since sif assumes zero mixing b however the thickness of the mixing zone also increases when the aquifer is more slender even for larger péclet numbers and modest coupling as seen e g in the case α 10 ξ 0 005 and p 1000 fig 6 and is greater still at stronger coupling as fig 5 shows thus without considering pumping and possible upconing a well penetrating 75 of the aquifer thickness and located at the interface end appears to be safe according to the sif model but reaches an area of 1500 ppm tds salinity finally we add information on the required cpu times for the vdf and the uncoupled interface bounded swi solutions both executed with feflow v 5 3 on a pc equipped with an intel core 2 cpu 6300 at 1 86 ghz running under windows xp professional v 2002 the cpu times depend on the test case characteristics as well as on the flow and transport regimes i e fully transient fully steady or steady flow and transient transport the uncoupled model solution converges under all flow and transport regimes while the vdf model may have to be run in fully transient mode typically for α 10 to reach its solution in the case ξ 0 01 α 10 p 1500 the vdf solution required 3 min 13 s for a transient flow and transport solution and the uncoupled solution took 1 s under steady state flow and transport mode and 9 s under fully transient mode in both cases the number of elements and nodes were approximately the same for comparison in the case ξ 0 01 α 50 p 1500 the vdf model had to be run in fully transient mode and required 48 min in contrast the uncoupled model solution was obtained in fully steady state mode in 5 s using again for comparison about the same number of nodes and elements as the vdf grid and in 2 s using about 40 of the vdf model s nodes and elements solution domain is only the through flow region in the latter case a fully transient uncoupled solution took 20 s 4 conclusions and outlook the comparison of the results of the uncoupled vdf approximation against the coupled vdf reference solutions confirms the premise of our modelling approach namely to use the interface with 50 sea salinity as flow boundary this concept is founded on the observation first made by henry 1964 that the interface also approximates the streamline separating the through flow region from the circulation region these conditions are met more closely at weaker coupling i e at smaller values of the parameter α the aspect ratio ξ and the péclet number p are secondary factors however accuracy useful for practical work is obtained up to α 20 α 25 interpreted with some tolerance for the typical swi field conditions 0 005 ξ 0 05 500 p 2000 and r d 0 1 this remarkable performance more than twentyfold improvement over the pseudo coupled model limited to the practice irrelevant α 1 is attributed to two reasons a confining the solution domain in the through flow region where advective transport is only seaward and the salinity varies from zero at the freshwater inflow section to 50 of sea salinity c s 2 17 500 ppm tds on the interface effectively halves the values of the density contrast δ and thus of the coupling parameter α and b using the interface as boundary on which c c s 2 enables starting the transport solution quite accurately past the high salinity region near the sea boundary where the ps c model performs inherently poorly we reiterate that the permissible salinity limits for various water uses are well under c s 2 the uncoupled interface bounded vdf approximation affords very significant computational gains vis à vis the fully coupled vdf equations and yields the salinity field that sif models are unable to deliver the division of the swi field in a freshwater region and a salty wedge via the sif model while leading analytically to some useful insights in the problem of swi into aquifers is not satisfactory for anything other than a preliminary survey of a regional aquifer s salinization risk unless the transition zone is truly thin applications at smaller scales are more questionable still e g beebe et al 2016 found that strack s analytical sif model predicted swi at an individual well correctly simply a yes or no answer based on a certain salinity threshold in just 59 of the 78 wells studied on the other hand the uncoupled model can estimate the essential for swi risk assessment salinity distribution competently and efficiently up to α 25 using standard groundwater flow and transport codes instead of carrying out tedious calculations with complex vdf simulation software the uncoupled interface bounded vdf approximation is then a parsimonious alternative to the fully coupled vdf model for at least α 20 in fact the uncoupled model could be also used for the purpose of rapidly gaining deeper insights into the swi response behaviour of confined aquifers under a variety of forcing and physical conditions that could even lead to instability when so called tipping points are crossed mazi et al 2013 furthermore the above advantages open up a wide field of computationally demanding swi modelling applications for which the effort for solving the coupled vdf equations would be prohibitive stochastic analysis is a prime example of an approach for which the uncoupled model would be particularly suitable one could execute efficiently multiple runs e g in the framework of monte carlo simulations to assess management alternatives with swi control options hussain et al 2020 of intensively developed regional coastal aquifers yet the uncoupled model would be also useful in the well established in hydrogeological praxis deterministic sensitivity analyses such analyses require evaluating the salinity field in an aquifer repeatedly for a range of parameter values and forcing scenarios our future research plans include swi applications of the uncoupled model to stratified confined and unconfined aquifers rathore et al 2020 exploited by a well gallery a line sink see koussis et al 2012 concluding we wish to point out that the vdf streamlines and salinity pattern suggest as conceptual model of swi into an aquifer the hydrologically active through flow zone underlain by a groundwater reservoir of zero net flow and high salinity that maintains the nominal interface at 50 of sea salinity via flow circulation this conceptual model replaces the interface flow artefact of a salinity discontinuity separating freshwater and seawater by computationally manageable variable salinity physics credit authorship contribution statement katerina mazi

seawater this corresponds to the so called oberbeck boussinesq approximation that ignores density differences except in terms multiplied by the gravitational acceleration vector g therefore eq a5

because this four fold variation towards low péclet numbers has some impact furthermore the new test simulations considered α values no higher than 50 δ δh o l strong coupling because beyond α 50 the impact of density contrast is so large as to prohibit using uncoupled equations even if the interface may approximate the 50 salinity line acceptably the vertical finite outflow gap is estimated here by also including the influence of ξ as a12 ζ o d 0 3515 α 0 905 ξ 0 2 r2 0 967 as in our previous work koussis and maz i 2018 we adopt the form of the correction of pool and carrera 2011 but with a

the interface curvature is generally variable the m value depends mainly on α and varies slowly with ξ and little with p small range the present study also includes the influence of the péclet number

resistivity hydraulic parameters 1 introduction surface water scarcity conditions caused by industrial growth and urbanization have significantly affected groundwater extraction especially in karst terrains around 20 of the earth s surface is composed of karst rocks whose aquifers are the sole source of water for 20 25 of the population ford and williams 2007 this dependence on karst rock along with the complex nature of karst systems due to connections between ground and surface water make karst hydrological studies particularly important characterization of this type of aquifer is quite tricky due to heterogeneous and anisotropic features and despite several studies in karst regions around the world the results cannot always be used or adapted to other known karst regions white 1993 goldscheider and drew 2007 several hydrogeological effects can occur in karst regions such as terrain subsidence collapse by means of natural conditions or induced accelerated by human activities newton 1976 1987 lamoreaux and newton 1986 lamoreaux 1997 galve et al 2009 galvão et al 2015 karst systems are also more vulnerable to contamination where such contaminant load can rapidly reach the aquifer through fractures or conduits goldscheider and drew 2007 galvão et al 2017 pereira et al 2019 another issue is the depletion or considerable reduction of discharge in conduits springs ponds or lakes due to groundwater overuse ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 kresic 2013 only a few studies were conducted on interactions between groundwater and lakes in karst terrains have been made dinçer and payne 1971 used environmental isotopes tritium deuterium and oxygen 18 to study several lakes rivers and karst springs in south western turkey low deuterium excess values associated with high δd values indicated evaporated water in some groundwater systems the variations in deuterium excess values in groundwater may therefore be explained by the mixing of such evaporated water and water recharged directly by infiltration a study at lake barco in florida used 87sr 86sr ratio with stable isotopes 18o d 13c as tracer to find a strong mixing between lake water leakage and groundwater near the lake katz and bullen 1996 motz 1998 also in florida developed a method for quantifying vertical leakage and vertically averaged conductance to investigate the apparent association between relatively large vertical conductance and lake level instabilities in karst areas roningen and burbey 2012 in mountain lake virginia studied the causes of the complete drying a

pessoa 1996 galvão et al 2015 population and industrial growth combined with the inefficient planning for urban expansion has already caused a series of geotechnical problems most of which occurred in

urban area the lake is an important aquifer recharge zone that is being influenced by regional karst hydrodynamics the primary justification for the current lake intermittence is related to the significant cone of depression in the urban area due to groundwater overuse some evidence indicates changes in groundwater flow directions around the lake towards wells during pumping tests as well as the association of the lake s droughts with the urban growth around it lake grande which has an area 1 km2 that is located in the northeast region of the municipality fig 1 has been experiencing significant decreases in the water levels have been continuously decreasing for the last 15 years this situation requires special attention as it is the largest lake in terms of area and volume as well as landscape and recharge of the local karst aquifer galvão et al 2017 it is reasonable to assume that the water level decline is caused by the substantial urban and industrial development of the lake s surrounding that occurred during the same period in accordance with these issues the objective of this study is to assess the different factors that likely contributed to the water level decline in the lake these factors are the increase in groundwater demand due to urban industrial expansion climatic variability and the presence of karst features that controls the hydraulic connections between the lake and the aquifer we used long term pumping tests with stable isotopic samplings 18o and 2h to analyze the hydraulic connections along with estimations of groundwater lake

databases to assess the climate variability a 3d karst hydrogeological conceptual model was developed to test and analyze our assumptions 2 site description the municipality of sete lagoas minas gerais brazil is about 70 km northwest of belo horizonte the state capital and has a population greater than 240 000 over an area of 538 km2 ibge 2020 the urban area experienced significant growth post 2000 s when industrialization expanded changing the demographic and increasing demand on the water supply santos 2016 the lake grande the study area is northeast of the municipality and has an area of about 1 km2 surrounded by factories in the north northwest and by urban areas in the south southwest fig 1 the public water supply comes mostly from groundwater extracted from 110 public wells managed by the water supply and sewage service saae serviço autônomo de água e esgoto the rest of the supply is extracted from the velhas river and treated at the sete lagoas water treatment station velhas river system the area in the são francisco craton where argillo carbonated sediments from the sete lagoas and serra de santa helena formations were deposited forming the bambuí group ribeiro et al 2003 the basement belo horizonte complex is composed of gneissic rocks associated with granitoid and migmatite zones overlying them the sete lagoas formation is divided into two members the pedro leopoldo member base is composed of fine limestones dolomites marlstones and pelites and has dissolution macrostructures usually in bedding planes and locally in subvertical fractures the lagoa santa member top composed of medium grained black limestones presents dissolution structures in grottos and caves indicating paleoconduits galvão et al 2015 the serra de santa helena formation is composed of slates marbles siltstones and claystones as well as quartz veins the cenozoic unconsolidated sediments cover the sete lagoas and serra de santa helena formations and are composed of sandy clayey sediments with gravel levels semi consolidated clay sandy materials and fine to coarse sand tuller et al 2010 galvão et al 2016 fig 1 the geomorphology is related to karst geology where sinkholes caves lakes ponds and poor drainage systems occur the presence of sinkholes in the context of karst is indirect evidence of the existence of karstified limestones in the subsurface wavy and hilly relief patterns are also common with water lines embedded between cliffs and valleys related to the rocks of the serra de santa helena formation pessoa 1996 there are three types of aquifers karst fractured and granular with karst being the most important pessoa 1996 the karst aquifer is formed by the sete lagoas formation consisting of fine limestones from the pedro leopoldo member and medium grained limestones from the lagoa santa member the recharge zones are mainly sinkholes and cave entrances autogenic and through areas where limestones are covered by cenozoic unconsolidated sediments allogenic the local precipitation during a limited period from october to december is the primary recharge source according to the water budgets proposed by pessoa 1996 and galvão et al 2017 most fluids migrate and store in tertiary porosities characterized by solutionally enlarged bedding planes less frequently water can also flow through enlarged subvertical fractures galvão et al 2015 2017 the regional groundwater flow follows the general bedding planes of ne orientation however a deviation of the groundwater direction in the central urban area of the municipality is noted due to the high concentration of wells that generate a large cone of depression galvão et al 2015 the hydrostratigrafic relationship for the sete lagoas karst aquifer its spatial distributions and the general hydrogeological conceptual model are given in pessoa 1996 galvão et al 2015 and magnabosco et al 2020 3 materials and methods to better understand the karst hydraulic connections between lake grande and the local aquifer and possible consequences from urbanization and or climate variations several methods were run and associated which is presented sequentially followed by the approach to data integration and in fig 2 3 1 climatological water budget analysis climatological water budgets cwb were made based on the thornthwaite and mather 1955 method according to the equation p q e δs where p is the precipitation mm q is the stream flow or surface runoff mm e is the evapotranspiration mm and δs is the changes in storage in soil or bedrock mm calculations were carried out year by year from 1961 to 2019 to identify significant variation changes that would justify a water level variation in lake grande data from conventional code omm83586 utm 578734 me 7848093 ms and automatic code a569 utm 586769 me 787858 ms climate stations by a governmental agency of climatological monitoring inmet https mapas inmet gov br were used fig 1 the parameters considered for cwb were monthly mean values of total precipitation pre mm and temperature t c and a value of field capacity of the soil of 150 mm the same value used by galvão et al 2018 only years with pre and t data for all months were selected as to not underestimate values of potential evapotranspiration pet mm actual evapotranspiration aet mm water deficit wd mm water excess we mm and change in storage δs to analyze epa aet wd we and δs data a boxplot with precipitation values was constructed outlier year values 1962 1963 2014 were not considered since they could produce erroneous trend data for the analyzed parameters moreover standard years have been identified which according to monteiro 1973 are determined based on the annual pre features being classified as habitual rainy and dry the determination of the standard years was carried out considering the uniformity in the distribution of the total pre values over the months and the monthly mean values over the years to be classified as a habitual standard year the total pre must be closer to the average pre value and the monthly rainfall distribution must be more uniform than the monthly pre average a rainy standard year is considered a year in which the total pre value falls above the average one plus the standard deviation value and the monthly rainfall values for that year are above the monthly averages a dry standard year is a year when the total pre falls below the average one minus the standard deviation value and the monthly rainfall values are below the monthly averages 3 2 potentiometric surface analysis potentiometric surfaces were determined from data of static water levels swl and dynamic water levels dwl provided by saae and integrated environmental information system siam sistema integrado de informação ambiental table 1 as well as by level measurements made in 2017 by magnabosco et al in press two different potentiometric surface maps were made 1 swl map a representation of the period between 1991 and 2008 before most of the land use around the lake and 2 dwl map a representation of the year 2017 related to well pumping rates from wells installed after these expansion the objective is to analyze possible changes in equipotential lines of groundwater and their flow directions caused by the increase in local groundwater consumption the wells selected were those with x and y coordinates lithological descriptions water level measurements and extracting groundwater from the sete lagoas karst aquifer based on the well depth related to geological cross sections table 1 the water levels considered were related to the dry season since the dwl values used by the magnabosco et al in press were also measured in the dry period considering the same period water level seasonal variations are avoided and the comparison between maps of different years is more appropriated the determination of hydraulic heads h were made by the differences between values of well terrain elevation and the respective swl and dwl the terrain elevations table 1 were extracted via dtm digital terrain model with an accuracy of 16 m from an srtm image shuttle radar topography mission embrapa 2005 with a 90 m resolution using the arcgis 10 software the interpolation of every h generated two distinct potentiometric surfaces one considering swl and the other counting only dwl then x and y coordinates and values of h were interpolated by the kriging method using the surfer 12 software aiming to elaborate h isoline maps representing potentiometric surfaces these primary maps were later refined and adjusted on corel draw software resulting in the final maps 3 3 time evolution of land use pumping rate and lake water level maps of time evolution relating urban industrial and agricultural use and well pumping rates table 1 around lake grande during the years 1985 1995 2005 2015 and 2019 were developed and analyzed the maps of urban industrial and agricultural use were based on images available on google earth the land use areas were delimitated considering a radius of 5 km from the center of lake grande the lake water level area was firstly delimited considering the year 1985 when the lake was at its highest level and the areas for the following years 1995 2005 2015 and 2019 were also delimitated to be compared to the year 1985 all the areas were calculated using arcgis 10 tools regarding pumping rates only public and private wells in operation and with license were considered data from possible illegal wells were not considered as there is no reliable estimate of the value pumped by this type of well comparatively these wells were inserted in the maps according to the year of installation to verify how the expansion of use in the area resulted in demand for water and in the decrease of the lake water level 3 4 long term well pumping test associated with stable isotopes a 72 hour pumping test was carried out in july 2019 in the pumping well pt 64 about 2 km from the center of lake grande to measure the evolution of the groundwater drawdown in the observation well pt 66 133 m from the pumping well fig 2 the constant pumping rate q was 145 m3 h where the ultrasonic flowmeter model dus tt p was used for pumping rate control the test determined the following hydrodynamic parameters hydraulic conductivity k transmissivity t and storativity s by using the theis 1935 method for interpretations although the method is applied classically in porous media aquifers it is possible to use it in karst areas if the values represent only the conditions around the tested well goldscheider and drew 2007 the objective of the test was to generate maximum stress in the aquifer so the cone of depression and its respective radius of influence possibly expand until the lake the hypothesis established is if a pumping test under a transient flow regime change to a steady state that is when drawdown in the aquifer stabilizes in a dynamic equilibrium it could indicate a possible hydraulic connection between the lake aquifer and pumping well when the water extracted from the aquifer is equal to the flow rate indicating a new contribution of water from another source freeze and cherry 1979 fetter 1994 concomitant with the pumping test 14 samples were collected in the pumping well pt 64 for stable isotopes analysis of 18o and 2h to verify whether the isotopic signature of lake grande correlates with the isotope signature of the groundwater during the test one sample was also collected in the center of lake grande for isotope comparisons fig 2 all the samples were collected in a pre cleaned amber vial 30 ml filled with sample avoiding air bubbles inside and stored in coolers at 4 c to avoid isotopic fractionation according to iaea who 2004 and analyzed at the department of geology federal university of ouro preto brazil the samples were run on a thermo finningan delta v advance mass spectrometer irms coupled to gasbench ii processed by the laboratory information management system lims and previously calibrated relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the results were expressed as δ18o and δ2h where δsample rsample rstandard 1 1000 where r is d h 18o 16o the analytical precision is 0 2 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h the fractionation factor used was 0 9981 for δ18o and 2 7365 for δ2h to correct the raw data the results were compared to the global meteoric water line gmwl rozanski et al 1993 and the belo horizonte meteoric water line bhmwl http isohis iaea org considered the local meteoric water line because of its similarities in climate and altitudes and the proximity to the area about 70 km 3 5 geophysical surveys the study acquired two types of geophysical surveys ten electrical resistivity image eri transects and five vertical electrical soundings ves were conducted the location of the surveys near lake grande was located based on previous studies consulting satellite images and by observing karst features such as sinkholes in the field the surveys were conducted during the dry season in dry areas of the lake to target subsurface karst features fig 2 the eri transects have lengths ranging from 235 to 315 m with an electrode spacing of 5 m the surveys were acquired using a dipole dipole array with a terrameter sas1000 instrument steel electrodes were inserted to the ground and connected to multielectrode cables the electrodes were wetted with a saline solution after being inserted in the ground to improve the electrode soil contact the ves surveys were performed using the same equipment utilizing a schlumberger array the maximum space between the electrodes was 200 m during the measurements when the electrode spacing had δv i in the potential electrodes 15 ω the procedure called clutch was performed as noted in the work of braga 2006 which consists of increasing the distance between the potential electrodes with superimposition of the two measurements over previously measured distances the data obtained for the eri transects were processed using the res2dinv software while the ves survey data were evaluated in the ipi2win software 3 6 conceptual model and hydrogeological sections the hydrogeological conceptual model is based on a data from 27 lithological well profiles provided by saae and siam and geological and topographic map analysis consulted in the works carried out by tuller et al 2010 galvão et al 2015 galvão et al 2016 and magnabosco et al 2020 all data and maps were used to create geological cross sections and to determine the geological contacts in subsurface and horizontally all the interpreted data were used in the leapfrog 3d geological modeling software where a model of approximately 7 8 7 8 0 4 km was created the development was carried out in a layered model using the surface chronology tool in which the following lithologies were inserted granite gneiss rocks from the belo horizonte complex limestones from the sete lagoas formation metapelites from the serra de santa helena formation and soil representing the cenozoic unconsolidated sediments after completing the model five geological cross sections with 5 vertical exaggeration were made which were later refined and adjusted and data of the groundwater level was added in the corel draw software 4 results 4 1 climatological water budget analysis due to the lack of temperature and precipitation data between 1983 and 1992 the results will be presented in two separate groups group 1 period 1961 1982 22 years and group 2 period 1993 2019 26 years the mean annual precipitation pre is 1300 7 mm and the period with high rainfall values is between october and march pessoa 1996 galvão et al 2017 while the driest months are between april and september table 2 comparing groups the annual rainfall values are mostly within one standard deviation while linear equations for groups 1 and 2 are respectively y 6 733x 1389 3 and y 10 591x 1453 3 indicating an increase in slope values of the trend lines from 6733 to 10 591 fig 3 a according to the classification of the standard years in habitual rainy or dry fig 3a 39 years are registered as habitual standard years being the year 1966 as reference year six years are classified as rainy standard years being the year 1962 as rainiest year and five years are considered as dry standard years being the year 1963 as least rainy year the year 1966 is the habitual standard year because its total rainfall value 1316 2 mm is the closest to the mean value for the analyzed period 1300 7 mm black line in fig 3a and presents the monthly distribution of precipitation closest to the monthly averages the year 1962 is the rainy standard year because the annual value 1966 8 mm exceeds the average value 1300 7 mm plus the standard deviation 276 7 mm blue line in the upper graph in fig 3 despite having more years above the value determined for rainy years 1962 is considered because the distribution of monthly rainfall values exceeds the monthly averages the year 1963 is the dry standard year due to the annual rainfall value 463 90 mm being less than the average value 1300 7 mm minus the standard deviation 276 7 mm red line in fig 3a the criterion for choosing 1963 is due to the monthly rainfall values being lower than the monthly averages the mean annual temperature t is 21 3 c however there is an increase of 7 in average values from 1961 around 20 9 c to 2019 22 4 c this can also be observed when analyzing the temperature trend lines fig 3a where group 1 1961 1982 has a linear equation equal to y 0 0024x 20 87 and group 2 1993 2019 is y 0 0299x 21 29 the slope value in group 2 0 0299 indicates a tendency for an incipient increase in temperatures in the last two decades compared to the slope in group 1 0 0024 an opposite behavior compared to the groups of precipitation the accumulated mean annual values for potential evapotranspiration epa is 1016 4 mm actual evapotranspiration aet 835 1 mm water deficit wd 181 3 mm water excess we 493 8 mm and change in storage δs 1096 6 mm indicating the water exceed coincides with the period of high values of rainfall in contrast high values of water deficit are related to the driest months table 2 in fig 3b the distributions of epa and aet show little tendency to increase after the year 1993 the slope values of linear equations confirm that epa group 1 0 297 and group 2 2 742 aet group 1 0 766 and group 2 1 578 in the same period there was also a tendency to increase the annual average temperature in fig 3c the distribution of wd indicates that 2002 was the year of the most significant loss with a deficit of 279 6 mm while 1968 was the lowest loss with 75 58 mm the values of we presented the highest value for the year 1965 941 8 mm and the lowest one in 1993 197 7 mm the δs has the highest value recorded in 1978 1413 5 mm while the lowest value was recorded in 1971 807 3 mm analyzing specific trend lines the period between 1993 and 2019 indicates a tendency to slight increases in wd values and a slight decrease in we value while experiencing a stabilization in δs values these overall tendencies can be checked in their respective slope values of the linear equations both in groups 1 and 2 wd group 1 0 469 and group 2 1 1645 we group 1 16 399 and group 2 5 924 δs group 1 1 768 and group 2 0 053 4 2 potentiometric surface maps the potentiometric surface map of static water levels swl relative to the period from 1991 to 2008 in general is similar to the maps published by pessoa 1996 and galvão et al 2015 in the same study area portion also showing groundwater flow directions to the northeast fig 4 the equipotential lines range from 720 m sw to 680 m northeast of lake grande the hydraulic gradient i is about 1 following the value estimated by magnabosco et al 2020 due to the small number of well data available for the period the swl map should only be considered as an inferred groundwater flow map the potentiometric surface map of dynamic water levels dwl relative to 2017 shows a significant modification in general groundwater flow directions being moved further north two cones of depression are now observed a bigger one surrounding an area occupied by factories in the north northwest region and a smaller one to the left of the lake these cones are the result of distinct two sets of pumping wells one that supplies the industrial area and another that supplies local residences and ranches fig 4 analyzing the equipotential line crossing over lake grande in both maps a negative variation of about 10 m in the hydraulic head from the swl map 690 m to the dwl map 680 is observed this may be one of the possible indications of lowering lake water levels as noted in the dwl map of 2017 4 3 time evolution of land use pumping rate and lake water level the time evolution maps fig 5 show a progressive increase in land use mainly urban and industrial around lake grande the urban area shows a significant growth in the west south and southwest while industrial growth advances in the north and agriculture in the northeast an increase in the number of pumping wells has been observed since 1995 with 1 well with a pumping rate 500 m3 d reaching 45 wells in 2019 mostly with pumping rates between 1000 and 2000 m3 d or 2000 m3 d because of this the overall pumping rate changed from 129 6 m3 d in 1995 to 32 335 m3 d in 2019 an increase in demand of approximately 25 000 per day in 25 years it should be emphasized that pumping rates in the region are expected to be higher than those considered as illegal wells were not accounted for besides as the area is in low expansion compared to the rest of the municipality the overall discharge value from illegal wells typically low rates for domestic uses would be negligible for this paper thus with the increase in urban industrial areas and hence in the number of wells a significant decrease in the lake water area was also observed which went from about 984 000 m2 in 1985 to 222 000 m2 in 2019 representing a 77 4 decrease in area 4 4 long term well pumping test associated with stable isotopes the observation well pt 66 showed a 1 42 m drawdown at the end of the 72 h 4320 min pumping test and a drawdown stabilization at 42 h 2520 min fig 6 based on the theis 1935 solution the hydraulic parameters for the local aquifer indicated t 28 85 m2 h 692 4 m2 d s 2 10 3 the value of s shows that the sete lagoas karst aquifer in this region is semi confined to confined corroborating magnabosco et al 2020 which indicates pelitic rocks and clay soils from the serra de santa helena formation covering the karst aquifer to estimate hydraulic conductivity k the sete lagoas formation s mean thickness was considered 123 m based on the magnabosco et al 2020 work thus the k value was equal to 2 34 10 1 m s 5 6 m d the stable isotope analysis shows δ2h values from the pumping test range from a minimum of 42 30 60 min test enriching to a maximum of 39 84 4500 min test a difference of 2 46 mean of 41 67 and median of 41 27 values of δ18o range from a minimum of 6 69 60 min test enriching to a maximum of 5 46 4500 min test a difference of 1 23 mean of 6 07 and median of 6 13 the d excess values range from 2 94 to 11 20 a difference of 8 26 a mean of 6 91 and a median of 6 60 the values of δ2h and δ18o for pt 64 galvão et al 2017 sampled in 2012 is 43 90 and 6 64 respectively close to the values of this study the values of δ2h and δ18o for lake grande is 8 91 and 2 53 respectively indicating a high evaporation signature table 3 the isotope data for pt 64 by galvão et al 2017 pink square and lake grande orange square were plotted and compared to the global meteoric water line gmwl and the belo horizonte meteoric water line bhmwl as well as with values relative to the lakes presented by galvão et al 2017 considered as the lake evaporation water line of the region fig 7 samples from the beginning of the pumping test black circle fall near gmwl and bhmwl however while the test is developing the samples tend to be plotted right below the gmwl and bhmwl from hour 42 the same period of the drawdown stabilization observed in the pumping test suggesting a local evaporation signature because of the δ18o enrichment probably a mixture between groundwater and evaporated surface water clark and fritz 1997 this scenario occurs mainly in karst aquifers where rapid flow hydraulic connections between surface and groundwater make this mixture possible thus comparing these values with the lake evaporation water line a correlation is noted where the sample group indicates a slope value close to the lake evaporation linear regression fig 7 thus mixing between two distinct waters e g groundwater and surface water can be quantified by a simple linear algebra using δ18o or δ2h clark and fritz 1997 so the proportion in percent of a mixture of groundwater one end member like the one pumped from pt 64 and surface water another end member like from the lake can be estimated relating directly the position of the samples over the evaporation water line which can be seen applied in fig 7 in the case of the pumping test the groundwater end member is considered the sample collected at 1 h that is 100 groundwater and the evaporation lake end member is the most isotopically enriched sample that is 100 evaporated water as the last groundwater from the pumping test was sampled at hour 72 proportionally in the mixing line this means that 87 of the water pumped comes from the karst aquifer and the remaining 13 corresponds to more evaporated waters that is from the lake fig 7 4 5 geophysical surveys the eri transects had good depth resolutions ranging from 42 to 70 m the ves surveys did not have great depths of investigation except for ves1 reaching 70 5 m because of humid clayey soils resulting in greater conductivity in such situations the electric current has difficulty with penetration generating high current and low potential values silva et al 2018 in general circular to ellipsoidal structures are observed in eri transects and can be interpreted as conducts or paleoconducts that may present different degrees of humidity depending on the resistivity value transects 2 3 and 4 fig 9 are in the center of the lake close to sinkholes gray polygons with red lines in fig 8 and to a structure of ne sw direction considered as a lineament orange line in fig 8 transects 2 and 3 show some anomalies that can be correlated the deeper regions of transects 2 3 and 4 around 675 m are more resistant corresponding to a more compact and preserved material possibly the substrate of the lake transects 6 and 7 fig 9 northeast of the lake present intermediate and high resistivities due to the distance from the lake water the deeper part of transect 7 is more resistive and may indicate the lake substrate where the elevation is about 675 m as with transects 2 3 and 4 the ves2 and 3 fig 9 over transects 6 and 7 respectively and at the same survey point and present 3 layers with different resistivity values these values correlate with the values at the respective depths of the transect 1 thickness about of 0 30 m and apparent resistivity between 1390 and 1820 ω m 2 thickness around 0 6 m and apparent resistivity of 18 000 ω m and 3 thickness between 6 and 10 m and resistivity between 1000 and 1200 ω m transects 8 and 9 nnw of the lake and transect 10 fig 9 northeast are generally more resistive possibly because they are outside the lake flooding area of low humidity fig 8 ves4 over transect 8 indicates 3 layers with different apparent resistivity compatible with the values of the transect 1 thickness of 0 30 m and 2607 ω m 2 thickness of 0 38 m and resistivity of 63 324 ω m and 3 17 7 m thick and 5758 ω m ves5 over transect 10 also indicates 3 layers 1 thickness of 0 36 m and 2650 ω m 2 thickness of 0 408 m and resistivity of 45 736 ω m 3 9 63 m thick and 5971 ω m fig 9 transects 1 and 5 fig 9 south of the lake topographically close to the water level are the most influenced by humidity with high conductivities fig 8 transect 5 the closest to the water has the highest conductivity values it is probably a more fractured area and therefore more susceptible to water seepage the region of intermediate to low resistivity in transect 1 coincides with the more conductive base of transect 5 ves1 over transect 5 indicates 4 layers 1 thickness of 0 31 m and resistivity of 309 ω m 2 0 47 m thickness and 2930 ω m 3 thickness of 6 65 m and 220 ω m 4 63 1 m thick and 57 8 ω m 4 6 conceptual model and hydrogeological sections the 3d hydrogeological conceptual model has an area of about 60 km2 fig 10 the cenozoic unconsolidated sediments have the most extensive area 54 6 km2 90 followed by the metapelitic rocks from the serra de santa helena formation 3 5 km2 5 7 to the north east west northeast and center and the limestones from the sete lagoas formation 2 6 km2 4 3 to the southeast and in the center the rocks from the basement do not outcrop in the area only in the south of the municipality the geological cross sections show that the highest thicknesses of the serra de santa helena formation are in the north and northwest region of the lake being thinner to the south and southeast in cross section 1 sw ne the serra de santa helena formation thickness reaches 300 m it is in this region that basement rocks occur at an approximate depth of 480 m fig 10 the current dynamic water level dwl blue line range is from 710 m sw to 590 m ne compared to former inferred static levels swt grey line a drop of about 80 m is observed where factories are located and hence most of the wells in cross section 2 sw ne the serra de santa helena formation is almost absent it mostly occurs in the ne of the section with a maximum thickness of 16 m the cenozoic unconsolidated sediments are directly covering the rocks of the sete lagoas formation indicating a depositional or erosional gap of the serra de santa helena formation fig 10 the dwl ranges from 710 m sw to 620 m ne with a hydraulic head variation in the ne when compared to the swl in cross section 3 nw se the serra de santa helena formation thickness decreases from nw to se from 330 m to 0 m the dwl ranges from 680 m nw to 710 m se in the center of the section a small cone of depression is observed due to some local wells reaching a hydraulic head of 670 m cross section 4 nw se shows how the serra de santa helena formation layer is thin compared to cross sections 1 and 3 with a maximum thickness of about 100 m being more similar to the features seen in cross section 2 fig 10 the dynamic water level in this section ranges from 590 m nw to 650 m se due to the proximity of the large cone of depression around the industrial area cross section 5 w e completely crossing over lake grande shows the thinning of the serra de santa helena formation layer in e direction at the w edge of the lake this formation is about 55 m thick and decreases being absent where the limestones from the sete lagoas formation emerge in the central area of the lake the dwl ranges from 710 m w to 670 m e where a 10 m reduction in the hydraulic head is observed over lake grande compared to the prior swl fig 10 5 discussion in general there are climate variations over the two analyzed groups 1961 1982 and 1993 2019 the second group displays a slight decrease in total precipitation volume compared to the first group fig 3 these variations may indicate climatic influences on lake s water level however this change alone would not impact the water volume to the degree seen today these results should be analyzed together with the land use expansion and its consequent increase in demand for water consumption in the region for a better context the expansion of land use may be negatively impacting the lake water levels and volume the increase in numbers of wells and the volume of water exploited could be contributing to the drying process of the lake especially if it is hydraulically connected to karst conduits that are intercepted by these wells comparing the potentiometric surface maps fig 4 the impact caused by the current overall exploitation q 32 355 m3 d is evident in two cones of depression the significantly bigger cone surrounding the industrial area is changing the former groundwater flows entirely before ne direction in accordance to limestone s bedding plane dips now towards to nnw and reducing the water level by up to 80 m this is corroborated when a direct relationship is made between increases in land use pumping rates and the lake s water level between 1995 and 2020 fig 5 this resulted in a reduction in the lake area of 77 4 from 984 000 m2 1985 to 222 000 m2 2019 regarding the long term pumping test a drawdown stabilization at 42 h was noted indicating a hydraulic connection with another source of water fig 6 as the majority of local groundwater is stored in tertiary porosity through karst enlarged bedding planes galvão et al 2015 the other significant water source could contribute locally to the aquifer and lake grande it relatively close to the well 2 km justifying the aquifer dynamic equilibrium from a transient flow regime to a steady state comparing this data with the isotopes the values for pt 64 over the pumping test showed fractionation behavior mainly of the δ18o in the same period in which the test s drawdowns stabilized the fractionation is also verified in the d excess values according to dansgaard 1964 d excess is represented by a linear coefficient that when 8 indicates evaporation effect and barbosa et al 2018 reports that evaporated waters from open surfaces or that passes through mixtures are positioned below the gmwl and have a coefficient between 2 and 5 which is observed in table 3 so the enrichment of the pt 64 is an indication of capture and mixing lake water in this case 87 groundwater and 13 lake water geophysically two distinct regions are observed 1 shallower and more conductive with more structures considered as paleoconduits and sinkholes and 2 more resistive indicating more compact lithotypes with no accumulation of water being more impermeable at greater depths or more resistant structures indicating a sandier material these structures are usually circular to ellipsoidal and vertical an indicator of karstification processes vertical electrical soundings indicate lateral variation in the soil profiles which can be explained by the location of the surveys mostly outside of the lake flooding area and hence less humidity except for ves1 of great depth in general the surveys indicate significant karst structures considered as water flowpaths that hydraulically connect lake grande to the sete lagoas karst aquifer where sinkholes in dry areas of the lake are autogenic recharge zones fig 8 although the interpretations suggest these conclusions borehole drillings in that areas are suggested to confirm these the 3d conceptual model indicates a thinning of the serra de santa helena formation from nw to se outcropping in the substrate of lake grande to the point where the sete lagoas formation outcrops the lineament of ne sw direction can explain this point in the magnetic map presented by magnabosco et al 2020 which can be inferred as a structural discontinuity observed in transects 1 3 and 4 this discontinuity may also be related to the basement rocks observed in section 1 in fig 10 this context is verified regionally and falls under the conceptual model of grabens and horsts described by galvão et al 2015 galvão et al 2016 and magnabosco et al 2020 based on this model it is possible to establish a differential erosion of the metapelite rocks from the serra de santa helena and the consequent exposure of limestones from the sete lagoas formation with these limestones on the surface weathering processes physical and chemical as well as karstification may have been active at the origin of lake grande this hypothesis also explains the occurrences of the main lakes in the central urban area of the municipality galvão et al 2015 in this model the karst aquifer is unconfined only in southeast and center north areas where the serra de santa helena formation does not cover the rocks of the sete lagoas formation fig 11 schematically shows the hydraulic connection between lake grande and the karst aquifer and how expansion and its consequent increase in water consumption coupled with climate variations may cause lake depletion 6 conclusions climate variations are observed during the last 58 years with a tendency to decrease water excess and increase water deficit however these changes are negligible in general and they are not causing a drastic reduction in the volume noted in lake grande as the lake s water level reduction began to be observed mainly in the last ten years the rapid expansion in urban industrial and agricultural use in recent years around the lake resulted in greater demands for groundwater and hence the increase of supply wells variations in the potentiometric surface after expansion resulted in cones of depression especially near the industrial area which resulted in a decrease of 77 4 in the lake water area the long term pumping test showed a drawdown stabilization at 42 h from a transient flow regime to a steady state indicating a hydraulic connection with a different water source it is corroborated with isotope results that show waters changing to a more evaporated pattern in the same period with enrichment of 18o isotopes the results show that lake grande could be the most likely source of water that pt 64 captures contributing 13 to the mixture geophysical surveys indirectly indicate karst features in the subsurface conducts and sinkholes which can be hydraulic connections between surface ground water the hydrogeological model indicates rocks from the sete lagoas formation directly below the cenozoic unconsolidated sediments providing conditions for forming these karst geomorphological structures from all these conclusions a hydraulic connection between supply wells and lake grande is indicated and has accelerated in the last 15 years for future studies long term pumping tests in wells located in the industrial area associated with dye tracer injections in sinkholes in the lake could corroborate the stable isotopes data also monitoring wells near the lake should be installed to verify lake and groundwater drawdown as well as numerical modeling to establish future pumping scenarios for water management are recommended declaration of competing

4949,reduction in volume of surface water bodies can sometimes be associated with hydraulic connections to groundwater aquifers this is often the case in karstic aquifers that are used for water supply this paper analyzed possible karst hydrogeological controls and anthropic effects in the depletion of a 1 km2 lake in the municipality of sete lagoas minas gerais brazil several techniques were used for the analyses long term pumping test coupled with stable isotopic samplings 18o and 2h to analyze for hydraulic connections and estimation of groundwater lake water mixture proportion geophysical surveys electrical resistivity image and vertical electrical sounding for mapping subsurface discontinuities potentiometric maps static and dynamic levels and urban industrial expansion of well pumping rates climatological water budget from 1961 to 2019 for climate variation analyzes and a 3d karst hydrogeological modeling results show climatic variation combined with urban industrial expansion increases the demand for water in the region and directly impacts local potentiometric surfaces and hence the lake water level geophysical surveys indicate that lake is karstically structured and identified preferential flowpaths for water infiltration and mixing the pumping test shows a drawdown stabilization from a transient flow regime to a steady state indicating a hydraulic connection with a water source that isotopically is more evaporated common in surface water which contributes 13 to the mixture keywords karst lake depletion environmental isotopes electrical resistivity hydraulic parameters 1 introduction surface water scarcity conditions caused by industrial growth and urbanization have significantly affected groundwater extraction especially in karst terrains around 20 of the earth s surface is composed of karst rocks whose aquifers are the sole source of water for 20 25 of the population ford and williams 2007 this dependence on karst rock along with the complex nature of karst systems due to connections between ground and surface water make karst hydrological studies particularly important characterization of this type of aquifer is quite tricky due to heterogeneous and anisotropic features and despite several studies in karst regions around the world the results cannot always be used or adapted to other known karst regions white 1993 goldscheider and drew 2007 several hydrogeological effects can occur in karst regions such as terrain subsidence collapse by means of natural conditions or induced accelerated by human activities newton 1976 1987 lamoreaux and newton 1986 lamoreaux 1997 galve et al 2009 galvão et al 2015 karst systems are also more vulnerable to contamination where such contaminant load can rapidly reach the aquifer through fractures or conduits goldscheider and drew 2007 galvão et al 2017 pereira et al 2019 another issue is the depletion or considerable reduction of discharge in conduits springs ponds or lakes due to groundwater overuse ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 kresic 2013 only a few studies were conducted on interactions between groundwater and lakes in karst terrains have been made dinçer and payne 1971 used environmental isotopes tritium deuterium and oxygen 18 to study several lakes rivers and karst springs in south western turkey low deuterium excess values associated with high δd values indicated evaporated water in some groundwater systems the variations in deuterium excess values in groundwater may therefore be explained by the mixing of such evaporated water and water recharged directly by infiltration a study at lake barco in florida used 87sr 86sr ratio with stable isotopes 18o d 13c as tracer to find a strong mixing between lake water leakage and groundwater near the lake katz and bullen 1996 motz 1998 also in florida developed a method for quantifying vertical leakage and vertically averaged conductance to investigate the apparent association between relatively large vertical conductance and lake level instabilities in karst areas roningen and burbey 2012 in mountain lake virginia studied the causes of the complete drying a lake in part the lake s water level depends on winter rains ice melting and changes in hydraulic parameters that occur over time that influence the continuity of the flow mccormack et al 2017 studied ephemeral lakes and submarine intertidal discharges in complex karst of bell harbour burren in western ireland electrical resistivity tomography ert was used to characterize the hydrogeology of the catchment by determining flow pathways and their likely hydraulic mechanisms the ert determined a low resistivity zone which is probably linked with groundwater flow pathways the municipality of sete lagoas minas gerais brazil is built over limestone layers rocks from the sete lagoas formation bambuí group and depends almost entirely on groundwater for supply from the sete lagoas karst aquifer pessoa 1996 galvão et al 2015 population and industrial growth combined with the inefficient planning for urban expansion has already caused a series of geotechnical problems most of which occurred in the central urban area a region with greater groundwater exploitation silva 1988 galvão et al 2015 these unexpected expansions possibly associated with climate variations overexploitation and karst features e g sinkholes and shallow conduits could impact the water levels of local lakes in a specific case assunção 2019 studied the 0 13 km2 lake matadouro a former perennial lake in the central urban area the lake is an important aquifer recharge zone that is being influenced by regional karst hydrodynamics the primary justification for the current lake intermittence is related to the significant cone of depression in the urban area due to groundwater overuse some evidence indicates changes in groundwater flow directions around the lake towards wells during pumping tests as well as the association of the lake s droughts with the urban growth around it lake grande which has an area 1 km2 that is located in the northeast region of the municipality fig 1 has been experiencing significant decreases in the water levels have been continuously decreasing for the last 15 years this situation requires special attention as it is the largest lake in terms of area and volume as well as landscape and recharge of the local karst aquifer galvão et al 2017 it is reasonable to assume that the water level decline is caused by the substantial urban and industrial development of the lake s surrounding that occurred during the same period in accordance with these issues the objective of this study is to assess the different factors that likely contributed to the water level decline in the lake these factors are the increase in groundwater demand due to urban industrial expansion climatic variability and the presence of karst features that controls the hydraulic connections between the lake and the aquifer we used long term pumping tests with stable isotopic samplings 18o and 2h to analyze the hydraulic connections along with estimations of groundwater lake water mixture proportion and we used geophysical surveys electrical resistivity image and vertical electrical sounding to mapping subsurface discontinuities and hydrogeological and climatological databases to assess the climate variability a 3d karst hydrogeological conceptual model was developed to test and analyze our assumptions 2 site description the municipality of sete lagoas minas gerais brazil is about 70 km northwest of belo horizonte the state capital and has a population greater than 240 000 over an area of 538 km2 ibge 2020 the urban area experienced significant growth post 2000 s when industrialization expanded changing the demographic and increasing demand on the water supply santos 2016 the lake grande the study area is northeast of the municipality and has an area of about 1 km2 surrounded by factories in the north northwest and by urban areas in the south southwest fig 1 the public water supply comes mostly from groundwater extracted from 110 public wells managed by the water supply and sewage service saae serviço autônomo de água e esgoto the rest of the supply is extracted from the velhas river and treated at the sete lagoas water treatment station velhas river system the area in the são francisco craton where argillo carbonated sediments from the sete lagoas and serra de santa helena formations were deposited forming the bambuí group ribeiro et al 2003 the basement belo horizonte complex is composed of gneissic rocks associated with granitoid and migmatite zones overlying them the sete lagoas formation is divided into two members the pedro leopoldo member base is composed of fine limestones dolomites marlstones and pelites and has dissolution macrostructures usually in bedding planes and locally in subvertical fractures the lagoa santa member top composed of medium grained black limestones presents dissolution structures in grottos and caves indicating paleoconduits galvão et al 2015 the serra de santa helena formation is composed of slates marbles siltstones and claystones as well as quartz veins the cenozoic unconsolidated sediments cover the sete lagoas and serra de santa helena formations and are composed of sandy clayey sediments with gravel levels semi consolidated clay sandy materials and fine to coarse sand tuller et al 2010 galvão et al 2016 fig 1 the geomorphology is related to karst geology where sinkholes caves lakes ponds and poor drainage systems occur the presence of sinkholes in the context of karst is indirect evidence of the existence of karstified limestones in the subsurface wavy and hilly relief patterns are also common with water lines embedded between cliffs and valleys related to the rocks of the serra de santa helena formation pessoa 1996 there are three types of aquifers karst fractured and granular with karst being the most important pessoa 1996 the karst aquifer is formed by the sete lagoas formation consisting of fine limestones from the pedro leopoldo member and medium grained limestones from the lagoa santa member the recharge zones are mainly sinkholes and cave entrances autogenic and through areas where limestones are covered by cenozoic unconsolidated sediments allogenic the local precipitation during a limited period from october to december is the primary recharge source according to the water budgets proposed by pessoa 1996 and galvão et al 2017 most fluids migrate and store in tertiary porosities characterized by solutionally enlarged bedding planes less frequently water can also flow through enlarged subvertical fractures galvão et al 2015 2017 the regional groundwater flow follows the general bedding planes of ne orientation however a deviation of the groundwater direction in the central urban area of the municipality is noted due to the high concentration of wells that generate a large cone of depression galvão et al 2015 the hydrostratigrafic relationship for the sete lagoas karst aquifer its spatial distributions and the general hydrogeological conceptual model are given in pessoa 1996 galvão et al 2015 and magnabosco et al 2020 3 materials and methods to better understand the karst hydraulic connections between lake grande and the local aquifer and possible consequences from urbanization and or climate variations several methods were run and associated which is presented sequentially followed by the approach to data integration and in fig 2 3 1 climatological water budget analysis climatological water budgets cwb were made based on the thornthwaite and mather 1955 method according to the equation p q e δs where p is the precipitation mm q is the stream flow or surface runoff mm e is the evapotranspiration mm and δs is the changes in storage in soil or bedrock mm calculations were carried out year by year from 1961 to 2019 to identify significant variation changes that would justify a water level variation in lake grande data from conventional code omm83586 utm 578734 me 7848093 ms and automatic code a569 utm 586769 me 787858 ms climate stations by a governmental agency of climatological monitoring inmet https mapas inmet gov br were used fig 1 the parameters considered for cwb were monthly mean values of total precipitation pre mm and temperature t c and a value of field capacity of the soil of 150 mm the same value used by galvão et al 2018 only years with pre and t data for all months were selected as to not underestimate values of potential evapotranspiration pet mm actual evapotranspiration aet mm water deficit wd mm water excess we mm and change in storage δs to analyze epa aet wd we and δs data a boxplot with precipitation values was constructed outlier year values 1962 1963 2014 were not considered since they could produce erroneous trend data for the analyzed parameters moreover standard years have been identified which according to monteiro 1973 are determined based on the annual pre features being classified as habitual rainy and dry the determination of the standard years was carried out considering the uniformity in the distribution of the total pre values over the months and the monthly mean values over the years to be classified as a habitual standard year the total pre must be closer to the average pre value and the monthly rainfall distribution must be more uniform than the monthly pre average a rainy standard year is considered a year in which the total pre value falls above the average one plus the standard deviation value and the monthly rainfall values for that year are above the monthly averages a dry standard year is a year when the total pre falls below the average one minus the standard deviation value and the monthly rainfall values are below the monthly averages 3 2 potentiometric surface analysis potentiometric surfaces were determined from data of static water levels swl and dynamic water levels dwl provided by saae and integrated environmental information system siam sistema integrado de informação ambiental table 1 as well as by level measurements made in 2017 by magnabosco et al in press two different potentiometric surface maps were made 1 swl map a representation of the period between 1991 and 2008 before most of the land use around the lake and 2 dwl map a representation of the year 2017 related to well pumping rates from wells installed after these expansion the objective is to analyze possible changes in equipotential lines of groundwater and their flow directions caused by the increase in local groundwater consumption the wells selected were those with x and y coordinates lithological descriptions water level measurements and extracting groundwater from the sete lagoas karst aquifer based on the well depth related to geological cross sections table 1 the water levels considered were related to the dry season since the dwl values used by the magnabosco et al in press were also measured in the dry period considering the same period water level seasonal variations are avoided and the comparison between maps of different years is more appropriated the determination of hydraulic heads h were made by the differences between values of well terrain elevation and the respective swl and dwl the terrain elevations table 1 were extracted via dtm digital terrain model with an accuracy of 16 m from an srtm image shuttle radar topography mission embrapa 2005 with a 90 m resolution using the arcgis 10 software the interpolation of every h generated two distinct potentiometric surfaces one considering swl and the other counting only dwl then x and y coordinates and values of h were interpolated by the kriging method using the surfer 12 software aiming to elaborate h isoline maps representing potentiometric surfaces these primary maps were later refined and adjusted on corel draw software resulting in the final maps 3 3 time evolution of land use pumping rate and lake water level maps of time evolution relating urban industrial and agricultural use and well pumping rates table 1 around lake grande during the years 1985 1995 2005 2015 and 2019 were developed and analyzed the maps of urban industrial and agricultural use were based on images available on google earth the land use areas were delimitated considering a radius of 5 km from the center of lake grande the lake water level area was firstly delimited considering the year 1985 when the lake was at its highest level and the areas for the following years 1995 2005 2015 and 2019 were also delimitated to be compared to the year 1985 all the areas were calculated using arcgis 10 tools regarding pumping rates only public and private wells in operation and with license were considered data from possible illegal wells were not considered as there is no reliable estimate of the value pumped by this type of well comparatively these wells were inserted in the maps according to the year of installation to verify how the expansion of use in the area resulted in demand for water and in the decrease of the lake water level 3 4 long term well pumping test associated with stable isotopes a 72 hour pumping test was carried out in july 2019 in the pumping well pt 64 about 2 km from the center of lake grande to measure the evolution of the groundwater drawdown in the observation well pt 66 133 m from the pumping well fig 2 the constant pumping rate q was 145 m3 h where the ultrasonic flowmeter model dus tt p was used for pumping rate control the test determined the following hydrodynamic parameters hydraulic conductivity k transmissivity t and storativity s by using the theis 1935 method for interpretations although the method is applied classically in porous media aquifers it is possible to use it in karst areas if the values represent only the conditions around the tested well goldscheider and drew 2007 the objective of the test was to generate maximum stress in the aquifer so the cone of depression and its respective radius of influence possibly expand until the lake the hypothesis established is if a pumping test under a transient flow regime change to a steady state that is when drawdown in the aquifer stabilizes in a dynamic equilibrium it could indicate a possible hydraulic connection between the lake aquifer and pumping well when the water extracted from the aquifer is equal to the flow rate indicating a new contribution of water from another source freeze and cherry 1979 fetter 1994 concomitant with the pumping test 14 samples were collected in the pumping well pt 64 for stable isotopes analysis of 18o and 2h to verify whether the isotopic signature of lake grande correlates with the isotope signature of the groundwater during the test one sample was also collected in the center of lake grande for isotope comparisons fig 2 all the samples were collected in a pre cleaned amber vial 30 ml filled with sample avoiding air bubbles inside and stored in coolers at 4 c to avoid isotopic fractionation according to iaea who 2004 and analyzed at the department of geology federal university of ouro preto brazil the samples were run on a thermo finningan delta v advance mass spectrometer irms coupled to gasbench ii processed by the laboratory information management system lims and previously calibrated relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the results were expressed as δ18o and δ2h where δsample rsample rstandard 1 1000 where r is d h 18o 16o the analytical precision is 0 2 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h the fractionation factor used was 0 9981 for δ18o and 2 7365 for δ2h to correct the raw data the results were compared to the global meteoric water line gmwl rozanski et al 1993 and the belo horizonte meteoric water line bhmwl http isohis iaea org considered the local meteoric water line because of its similarities in climate and altitudes and the proximity to the area about 70 km 3 5 geophysical surveys the study acquired two types of geophysical surveys ten electrical resistivity image eri transects and five vertical electrical soundings ves were conducted the location of the surveys near lake grande was located based on previous studies consulting satellite images and by observing karst features such as sinkholes in the field the surveys were conducted during the dry season in dry areas of the lake to target subsurface karst features fig 2 the eri transects have lengths ranging from 235 to 315 m with an electrode spacing of 5 m the surveys were acquired using a dipole dipole array with a terrameter sas1000 instrument steel electrodes were inserted to the ground and connected to multielectrode cables the electrodes were wetted with a saline solution after being inserted in the ground to improve the electrode soil contact the ves surveys were performed using the same equipment utilizing a schlumberger array the maximum space between the electrodes was 200 m during the measurements when the electrode spacing had δv i in the potential electrodes 15 ω the procedure called clutch was performed as noted in the work of braga 2006 which consists of increasing the distance between the potential electrodes with superimposition of the two measurements over previously measured distances the data obtained for the eri transects were processed using the res2dinv software while the ves survey data were evaluated in the ipi2win software 3 6 conceptual model and hydrogeological sections the hydrogeological conceptual model is based on a data from 27 lithological well profiles provided by saae and siam and geological and topographic map analysis consulted in the works carried out by tuller et al 2010 galvão et al 2015 galvão et al 2016 and magnabosco et al 2020 all data and maps were used to create geological cross sections and to determine the geological contacts in subsurface and horizontally all the interpreted data were used in the leapfrog 3d geological modeling software where a model of approximately 7 8 7 8 0 4 km was created the development was carried out in a layered model using the surface chronology tool in which the following lithologies were inserted granite gneiss rocks from the belo horizonte complex limestones from the sete lagoas formation metapelites from the serra de santa helena formation and soil representing the cenozoic unconsolidated sediments after completing the model five geological cross sections with 5 vertical exaggeration were made which were later refined and adjusted and data of the groundwater level was added in the corel draw software 4 results 4 1 climatological water budget analysis due to the lack of temperature and precipitation data between 1983 and 1992 the results will be presented in two separate groups group 1 period 1961 1982 22 years and group 2 period 1993 2019 26 years the mean annual precipitation pre is 1300 7 mm and the period with high rainfall values is between october and march pessoa 1996 galvão et al 2017 while the driest months are between april and september table 2 comparing groups the annual rainfall values are mostly within one standard deviation while linear equations for groups 1 and 2 are respectively y 6 733x 1389 3 and y 10 591x 1453 3 indicating an increase in slope values of the trend lines from 6733 to 10 591 fig 3 a according to the classification of the standard years in habitual rainy or dry fig 3a 39 years are registered as habitual standard years being the year 1966 as reference year six years are classified as rainy standard years being the year 1962 as rainiest year and five years are considered as dry standard years being the year 1963 as least rainy year the year 1966 is the habitual standard year because its total rainfall value 1316 2 mm is the closest to the mean value for the analyzed period 1300 7 mm black line in fig 3a and presents the monthly distribution of precipitation closest to the monthly averages the year 1962 is the rainy standard year because the annual value 1966 8 mm exceeds the average value 1300 7 mm plus the standard deviation 276 7 mm blue line in the upper graph in fig 3 despite having more years above the value determined for rainy years 1962 is considered because the distribution of monthly rainfall values exceeds the monthly averages the year 1963 is the dry standard year due to the annual rainfall value 463 90 mm being less than the average value 1300 7 mm minus the standard deviation 276 7 mm red line in fig 3a the criterion for choosing 1963 is due to the monthly rainfall values being lower than the monthly averages the mean annual temperature t is 21 3 c however there is an increase of 7 in average values from 1961 around 20 9 c to 2019 22 4 c this can also be observed when analyzing the temperature trend lines fig 3a where group 1 1961 1982 has a linear equation equal to y 0 0024x 20 87 and group 2 1993 2019 is y 0 0299x 21 29 the slope value in group 2 0 0299 indicates a tendency for an incipient increase in temperatures in the last two decades compared to the slope in group 1 0 0024 an opposite behavior compared to the groups of precipitation the accumulated mean annual values for potential evapotranspiration epa is 1016 4 mm actual evapotranspiration aet 835 1 mm water deficit wd 181 3 mm water excess we 493 8 mm and change in storage δs 1096 6 mm indicating the water exceed coincides with the period of high values of rainfall in contrast high values of water deficit are related to the driest months table 2 in fig 3b the distributions of epa and aet show little tendency to increase after the year 1993 the slope values of linear equations confirm that epa group 1 0 297 and group 2 2 742 aet group 1 0 766 and group 2 1 578 in the same period there was also a tendency to increase the annual average temperature in fig 3c the distribution of wd indicates that 2002 was the year of the most significant loss with a deficit of 279 6 mm while 1968 was the lowest loss with 75 58 mm the values of we presented the highest value for the year 1965 941 8 mm and the lowest one in 1993 197 7 mm the δs has the highest value recorded in 1978 1413 5 mm while the lowest value was recorded in 1971 807 3 mm analyzing specific trend lines the period between 1993 and 2019 indicates a tendency to slight increases in wd values and a slight decrease in we value while experiencing a stabilization in δs values these overall tendencies can be checked in their respective slope values of the linear equations both in groups 1 and 2 wd group 1 0 469 and group 2 1 1645 we group 1 16 399 and group 2 5 924 δs group 1 1 768 and group 2 0 053 4 2 potentiometric surface maps the potentiometric surface map of static water levels swl relative to the period from 1991 to 2008 in general is similar to the maps published by pessoa 1996 and galvão et al 2015 in the same study area portion also showing groundwater flow directions to the northeast fig 4 the equipotential lines range from 720 m sw to 680 m northeast of lake grande the hydraulic gradient i is about 1 following the value estimated by magnabosco et al 2020 due to the small number of well data available for the period the swl map should only be considered as an inferred groundwater flow map the potentiometric surface map of dynamic water levels dwl relative to 2017 shows a significant modification in general groundwater flow directions being moved further north two cones of depression are now observed a bigger one surrounding an area occupied by factories in the north northwest region and a smaller one to the left of the lake these cones are the result of distinct two sets of pumping wells one that supplies the industrial area and another that supplies local residences and ranches fig 4 analyzing the equipotential line crossing over lake grande in both maps a negative variation of about 10 m in the hydraulic head from the swl map 690 m to the dwl map 680 is observed this may be one of the possible indications of lowering lake water levels as noted in the dwl map of 2017 4 3 time evolution of land use pumping rate and lake water level the time evolution maps fig 5 show a progressive increase in land use mainly urban and industrial around lake grande the urban area shows a significant growth in the west south and southwest while industrial growth advances in the north and agriculture in the northeast an increase in the number of pumping wells has been observed since 1995 with 1 well with a pumping rate 500 m3 d reaching 45 wells in 2019 mostly with pumping rates between 1000 and 2000 m3 d or 2000 m3 d because of this the overall pumping rate changed from 129 6 m3 d in 1995 to 32 335 m3 d in 2019 an increase in demand of approximately 25 000 per day in 25 years it should be emphasized that pumping rates in the region are expected to be higher than those considered as illegal wells were not accounted for besides as the area is in low expansion compared to the rest of the municipality the overall discharge value from illegal wells typically low rates for domestic uses would be negligible for this paper thus with the increase in urban industrial areas and hence in the number of wells a significant decrease in the lake water area was also observed which went from about 984 000 m2 in 1985 to 222 000 m2 in 2019 representing a 77 4 decrease in area 4 4 long term well pumping test associated with stable isotopes the observation well pt 66 showed a 1 42 m drawdown at the end of the 72 h 4320 min pumping test and a drawdown stabilization at 42 h 2520 min fig 6 based on the theis 1935 solution the hydraulic parameters for the local aquifer indicated t 28 85 m2 h 692 4 m2 d s 2 10 3 the value of s shows that the sete lagoas karst aquifer in this region is semi confined to confined corroborating magnabosco et al 2020 which indicates pelitic rocks and clay soils from the serra de santa helena formation covering the karst aquifer to estimate hydraulic conductivity k the sete lagoas formation s mean thickness was considered 123 m based on the magnabosco et al 2020 work thus the k value was equal to 2 34 10 1 m s 5 6 m d the stable isotope analysis shows δ2h values from the pumping test range from a minimum of 42 30 60 min test enriching to a maximum of 39 84 4500 min test a difference of 2 46 mean of 41 67 and median of 41 27 values of δ18o range from a minimum of 6 69 60 min test enriching to a maximum of 5 46 4500 min test a difference of 1 23 mean of 6 07 and median of 6 13 the d excess values range from 2 94 to 11 20 a difference of 8 26 a mean of 6 91 and a median of 6 60 the values of δ2h and δ18o for pt 64 galvão et al 2017 sampled in 2012 is 43 90 and 6 64 respectively close to the values of this study the values of δ2h and δ18o for lake grande is 8 91 and 2 53 respectively indicating a high evaporation signature table 3 the isotope data for pt 64 by galvão et al 2017 pink square and lake grande orange square were plotted and compared to the global meteoric water line gmwl and the belo horizonte meteoric water line bhmwl as well as with values relative to the lakes presented by galvão et al 2017 considered as the lake evaporation water line of the region fig 7 samples from the beginning of the pumping test black circle fall near gmwl and bhmwl however while the test is developing the samples tend to be plotted right below the gmwl and bhmwl from hour 42 the same period of the drawdown stabilization observed in the pumping test suggesting a local evaporation signature because of the δ18o enrichment probably a mixture between groundwater and evaporated surface water clark and fritz 1997 this scenario occurs mainly in karst aquifers where rapid flow hydraulic connections between surface and groundwater make this mixture possible thus comparing these values with the lake evaporation water line a correlation is noted where the sample group indicates a slope value close to the lake evaporation linear regression fig 7 thus mixing between two distinct waters e g groundwater and surface water can be quantified by a simple linear algebra using δ18o or δ2h clark and fritz 1997 so the proportion in percent of a mixture of groundwater one end member like the one pumped from pt 64 and surface water another end member like from the lake can be estimated relating directly the position of the samples over the evaporation water line which can be seen applied in fig 7 in the case of the pumping test the groundwater end member is considered the sample collected at 1 h that is 100 groundwater and the evaporation lake end member is the most isotopically enriched sample that is 100 evaporated water as the last groundwater from the pumping test was sampled at hour 72 proportionally in the mixing line this means that 87 of the water pumped comes from the karst aquifer and the remaining 13 corresponds to more evaporated waters that is from the lake fig 7 4 5 geophysical surveys the eri transects had good depth resolutions ranging from 42 to 70 m the ves surveys did not have great depths of investigation except for ves1 reaching 70 5 m because of humid clayey soils resulting in greater conductivity in such situations the electric current has difficulty with penetration generating high current and low potential values silva et al 2018 in general circular to ellipsoidal structures are observed in eri transects and can be interpreted as conducts or paleoconducts that may present different degrees of humidity depending on the resistivity value transects 2 3 and 4 fig 9 are in the center of the lake close to sinkholes gray polygons with red lines in fig 8 and to a structure of ne sw direction considered as a lineament orange line in fig 8 transects 2 and 3 show some anomalies that can be correlated the deeper regions of transects 2 3 and 4 around 675 m are more resistant corresponding to a more compact and preserved material possibly the substrate of the lake transects 6 and 7 fig 9 northeast of the lake present intermediate and high resistivities due to the distance from the lake water the deeper part of transect 7 is more resistive and may indicate the lake substrate where the elevation is about 675 m as with transects 2 3 and 4 the ves2 and 3 fig 9 over transects 6 and 7 respectively and at the same survey point and present 3 layers with different resistivity values these values correlate with the values at the respective depths of the transect 1 thickness about of 0 30 m and apparent resistivity between 1390 and 1820 ω m 2 thickness around 0 6 m and apparent resistivity of 18 000 ω m and 3 thickness between 6 and 10 m and resistivity between 1000 and 1200 ω m transects 8 and 9 nnw of the lake and transect 10 fig 9 northeast are generally more resistive possibly because they are outside the lake flooding area of low humidity fig 8 ves4 over transect 8 indicates 3 layers with different apparent resistivity compatible with the values of the transect 1 thickness of 0 30 m and 2607 ω m 2 thickness of 0 38 m and resistivity of 63 324 ω m and 3 17 7 m thick and 5758 ω m ves5 over transect 10 also indicates 3 layers 1 thickness of 0 36 m and 2650 ω m 2 thickness of 0 408 m and resistivity of 45 736 ω m 3 9 63 m thick and 5971 ω m fig 9 transects 1 and 5 fig 9 south of the lake topographically close to the water level are the most influenced by humidity with high conductivities fig 8 transect 5 the closest to the water has the highest conductivity values it is probably a more fractured area and therefore more susceptible to water seepage the region of intermediate to low resistivity in transect 1 coincides with the more conductive base of transect 5 ves1 over transect 5 indicates 4 layers 1 thickness of 0 31 m and resistivity of 309 ω m 2 0 47 m thickness and 2930 ω m 3 thickness of 6 65 m and 220 ω m 4 63 1 m thick and 57 8 ω m 4 6 conceptual model and hydrogeological sections the 3d hydrogeological conceptual model has an area of about 60 km2 fig 10 the cenozoic unconsolidated sediments have the most extensive area 54 6 km2 90 followed by the metapelitic rocks from the serra de santa helena formation 3 5 km2 5 7 to the north east west northeast and center and the limestones from the sete lagoas formation 2 6 km2 4 3 to the southeast and in the center the rocks from the basement do not outcrop in the area only in the south of the municipality the geological cross sections show that the highest thicknesses of the serra de santa helena formation are in the north and northwest region of the lake being thinner to the south and southeast in cross section 1 sw ne the serra de santa helena formation thickness reaches 300 m it is in this region that basement rocks occur at an approximate depth of 480 m fig 10 the current dynamic water level dwl blue line range is from 710 m sw to 590 m ne compared to former inferred static levels swt grey line a drop of about 80 m is observed where factories are located and hence most of the wells in cross section 2 sw ne the serra de santa helena formation is almost absent it mostly occurs in the ne of the section with a maximum thickness of 16 m the cenozoic unconsolidated sediments are directly covering the rocks of the sete lagoas formation indicating a depositional or erosional gap of the serra de santa helena formation fig 10 the dwl ranges from 710 m sw to 620 m ne with a hydraulic head variation in the ne when compared to the swl in cross section 3 nw se the serra de santa helena formation thickness decreases from nw to se from 330 m to 0 m the dwl ranges from 680 m nw to 710 m se in the center of the section a small cone of depression is observed due to some local wells reaching a hydraulic head of 670 m cross section 4 nw se shows how the serra de santa helena formation layer is thin compared to cross sections 1 and 3 with a maximum thickness of about 100 m being more similar to the features seen in cross section 2 fig 10 the dynamic water level in this section ranges from 590 m nw to 650 m se due to the proximity of the large cone of depression around the industrial area cross section 5 w e completely crossing over lake grande shows the thinning of the serra de santa helena formation layer in e direction at the w edge of the lake this formation is about 55 m thick and decreases being absent where the limestones from the sete lagoas formation emerge in the central area of the lake the dwl ranges from 710 m w to 670 m e where a 10 m reduction in the hydraulic head is observed over lake grande compared to the prior swl fig 10 5 discussion in general there are climate variations over the two analyzed groups 1961 1982 and 1993 2019 the second group displays a slight decrease in total precipitation volume compared to the first group fig 3 these variations may indicate climatic influences on lake s water level however this change alone would not impact the water volume to the degree seen today these results should be analyzed together with the land use expansion and its consequent increase in demand for water consumption in the region for a better context the expansion of land use may be negatively impacting the lake water levels and volume the increase in numbers of wells and the volume of water exploited could be contributing to the drying process of the lake especially if it is hydraulically connected to karst conduits that are intercepted by these wells comparing the potentiometric surface maps fig 4 the impact caused by the current overall exploitation q 32 355 m3 d is evident in two cones of depression the significantly bigger cone surrounding the industrial area is changing the former groundwater flows entirely before ne direction in accordance to limestone s bedding plane dips now towards to nnw and reducing the water level by up to 80 m this is corroborated when a direct relationship is made between increases in land use pumping rates and the lake s water level between 1995 and 2020 fig 5 this resulted in a reduction in the lake area of 77 4 from 984 000 m2 1985 to 222 000 m2 2019 regarding the long term pumping test a drawdown stabilization at 42 h was noted indicating a hydraulic connection with another source of water fig 6 as the majority of local groundwater is stored in tertiary porosity through karst enlarged bedding planes galvão et al 2015 the other significant water source could contribute locally to the aquifer and lake grande it relatively close to the well 2 km justifying the aquifer dynamic equilibrium from a transient flow regime to a steady state comparing this data with the isotopes the values for pt 64 over the pumping test showed fractionation behavior mainly of the δ18o in the same period in which the test s drawdowns stabilized the fractionation is also verified in the d excess values according to dansgaard 1964 d excess is represented by a linear coefficient that when 8 indicates evaporation effect and barbosa et al 2018 reports that evaporated waters from open surfaces or that passes through mixtures are positioned below the gmwl and have a coefficient between 2 and 5 which is observed in table 3 so the enrichment of the pt 64 is an indication of capture and mixing lake water in this case 87 groundwater and 13 lake water geophysically two distinct regions are observed 1 shallower and more conductive with more structures considered as paleoconduits and sinkholes and 2 more resistive indicating more compact lithotypes with no accumulation of water being more impermeable at greater depths or more resistant structures indicating a sandier material these structures are usually circular to ellipsoidal and vertical an indicator of karstification processes vertical electrical soundings indicate lateral variation in the soil profiles which can be explained by the location of the surveys mostly outside of the lake flooding area and hence less humidity except for ves1 of great depth in general the surveys indicate significant karst structures considered as water flowpaths that hydraulically connect lake grande to the sete lagoas karst aquifer where sinkholes in dry areas of the lake are autogenic recharge zones fig 8 although the interpretations suggest these conclusions borehole drillings in that areas are suggested to confirm these the 3d conceptual model indicates a thinning of the serra de santa helena formation from nw to se outcropping in the substrate of lake grande to the point where the sete lagoas formation outcrops the lineament of ne sw direction can explain this point in the magnetic map presented by magnabosco et al 2020 which can be inferred as a structural discontinuity observed in transects 1 3 and 4 this discontinuity may also be related to the basement rocks observed in section 1 in fig 10 this context is verified regionally and falls under the conceptual model of grabens and horsts described by galvão et al 2015 galvão et al 2016 and magnabosco et al 2020 based on this model it is possible to establish a differential erosion of the metapelite rocks from the serra de santa helena and the consequent exposure of limestones from the sete lagoas formation with these limestones on the surface weathering processes physical and chemical as well as karstification may have been active at the origin of lake grande this hypothesis also explains the occurrences of the main lakes in the central urban area of the municipality galvão et al 2015 in this model the karst aquifer is unconfined only in southeast and center north areas where the serra de santa helena formation does not cover the rocks of the sete lagoas formation fig 11 schematically shows the hydraulic connection between lake grande and the karst aquifer and how expansion and its consequent increase in water consumption coupled with climate variations may cause lake depletion 6 conclusions climate variations are observed during the last 58 years with a tendency to decrease water excess and increase water deficit however these changes are negligible in general and they are not causing a drastic reduction in the volume noted in lake grande as the lake s water level reduction began to be observed mainly in the last ten years the rapid expansion in urban industrial and agricultural use in recent years around the lake resulted in greater demands for groundwater and hence the increase of supply wells variations in the potentiometric surface after expansion resulted in cones of depression especially near the industrial area which resulted in a decrease of 77 4 in the lake water area the long term pumping test showed a drawdown stabilization at 42 h from a transient flow regime to a steady state indicating a hydraulic connection with a different water source it is corroborated with isotope results that show waters changing to a more evaporated pattern in the same period with enrichment of 18o isotopes the results show that lake grande could be the most likely source of water that pt 64 captures contributing 13 to the mixture geophysical surveys indirectly indicate karst features in the subsurface conducts and sinkholes which can be hydraulic connections between surface ground water the hydrogeological model indicates rocks from the sete lagoas formation directly below the cenozoic unconsolidated sediments providing conditions for forming these karst geomorphological structures from all these conclusions a hydraulic connection between supply wells and lake grande is indicated and has accelerated in the last 15 years for future studies long term pumping tests in wells located in the industrial area associated with dye tracer injections in sinkholes in the lake could corroborate the stable isotopes data also monitoring wells near the lake should be installed to verify lake and groundwater drawdown as well as numerical modeling to establish future pumping scenarios for water management are recommended declaration of competing
