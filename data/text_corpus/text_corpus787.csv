3935,the climate uncertainties data scarcity and socio techno challenges pose significant threats and options respectively to the future planning of complex water projects in developing countries this paper attempts to develop a decision support system dss framework to classify uncertainties and management options using participatory scoping for scenarios analysis with the aid of six interrelated modules namely i water balance of reservoirs for computation of runoff ii statistical downscaling for climate projection iii hydrological modelling iv sediment assessment v water management and vi decision support for the assessment of the performance of multiple management plans designed for three future assessment periods of 2020 35 2046 64 and 2081 99 the proposed framework was applied to the tandula complex system of chhattisgarh state of india consists of three reservoirs namely tandula kharkhara and gondli having water transfer in their commands and for industrial use the developed dss framework provides the opportunity to analyze the management plans with climate uncertainties for the complex water resources projects having data scarcity here in the present paper the developed dss framework incorporates eighty four diverse management plans devised from constant interaction with stakeholders and technocrats resulting to deal with climate uncertainties using possible improvement in efficiencies and consumptive use for three future assessment periods furthermore the performance of the developed plans was evaluated using multi criteria decision support in the three layer hierarchal process the decision support analysis suggested that the second assessment period fp 2 2046 64 will be more crucial from the management point of view where 54 out of 81 plans could not perform as par with the present performance of the system the developed dss framework provides a solution for strategic water resources planning and management under projected climate scenarios in a basin having problems of scarcity surplus and non uniform distribution of surface water using the participation of farmers technocrats and water resource managers keywords water resource management

plans under plausible future and assessment of system performance is the way forward rather than using sampling through probability distribution greiner et al 2014 beh et al 2015 lan et al 2015 etc various techniques under exploratory approach have been propagated in the past for decision making under deep uncertain situations included adaptive policy making kwakkel et al 2010 adaptation tipping

making under climate change and explain the usefulness of robust decision making for supporting adaptation policies roach 2016 critically reviewed the number of decision making techniques and concluded that robust decision making rdm and decision scaling ds are easy for approaching a decision and prioritize adaptation strategies than other decision making processes the adaptation studies for water resource management require a holistic approach with participatory scoping of all actors and technical explanations with the support of a strong database and appropriate modelling approach upadhyay 2016 assessing the true availability of water certainly use to be the key factor for assuring optimum planning and management of water both at the catchment and the command area level where availability of hydrological data is of fundamental importance ireson et al 2006 in the absence of measured runoff and sediment data adopting the reservoir based water balancing approach to understand and regulate supply or demand and remote sensing approach for estimation of revised capacities hold high value for semi arid regions like that of india in this paper a framework of dss has been proposed with the aid of multiple modules for development and evaluation of several management plans under future climatic scenarios further its potential has been demonstrated for a data scares complex water resource project in india considering future periods namely the near century period from 2020 to 35 fp 1 the mid century period from 2046 to 64 fp 2 and the far century period from 2081 to 99 fp 3 2 materials and method 2 1 study area and data used the proposed dss framework has been applied to the tandula complex system in the chhattisgarh state of india having three dams namely tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs these reservoirs supply irrigation water to their own and other reservoirs commands and industrial water supply to bhilai steel plant bsp situated in industrial city bhilai the paddy is the only crop in all three commands where irrigation water is supplied from tandula complex system during kharif season ambagarh balod bhanpura chamra and gondli rain gauge rg stations are situated in and around these catchments the location map of the tandula complex is presented in fig 1 a while water transfer in fig 1 b the detailed information about tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs of the tandula complex have been presented in table 1 a large amount of hydrological meteorological and spatially distributed maps and information collected from different sources consist of climatic data from 1973 to 2015 of raipur india from indira gandhi krishi vishvidalaya raipur rainfall data of ambagarh balod bhanpura chamra and gondli rg stations daily reservoir

climate modelling canada ca from 2006 to 2099 have been used the multi date liss iii data of irs 1d p6 path 101 and row 58 from nrsc hyderabad have been used for land use and assessment of revised capacities the soil map of the study area has been extracted from the map of nbsslup nagpur and literature review tamgadge et al 2002 kumar et al 2015 the delineation of basin and drainage in the catchment was performed from aster dem obtained from https asterweb jpl nasa gov gdem asp in the study constant interaction with farmers engineers water resource managers and technocrats was made to get new plans strategies 2 2 methodology existing water resource projects in developing countries like india are under increasing pressure due to depleting water resources and increased demand as a result of the rising population and repercussions of climate change the implications of climate change on availability and demand necessitate the formulation of long term policies based on future climatic scenarios now there is a growing understanding of the need to aim for long term developmental outcomes from irrigation such as more productive water usage climatic resilience and environmental sustainability rather than just irrigation efficiency implementation of adaptation strategies on the other hand is challenging due to thelack of sufficient data and information inadequate knowledge and a reluctance to adopt innovation and technology among various stakeholders to address issues of water resources management holistically aframework proposed in this paper considers inflow computation from reservoir water balances reservoir sediment efficient modelling and management strategies and a comprehensive assessment of future scenario performance using a robust decision support system the methodology for the suggested framework consists of the development of different modules and their links based on constant interaction with stakeholders managers and technocrats to consider data problems uncertainties social constraints and possible future interventions with participatory scoping based on the feedback received on perceived uncertainties and management options six interrelated modules have been designed and presented in fig 2 the concept and methodology adopted for these modules are described in the next sections 2 2 1 module i water balance of reservoirs in developing countries the availability of runoff data is limited and gauging generally stopped after the construction of dams in such a situation the water balance can be used as an alternative to computing runoff from the catchment the hydrologic balance in the case of water bodies provides stored water in controlled section and inflows from the basin using a simple mass balance where the sum of all outflows deducted from the sum of inflows provides the change in stored volume over a specific period sokolov and chapman 1974 thomann and mueller 1987 chapra 1997 fetter 2001 aparicio 2005 iaea 2007 d urquiza diaz et al 2009 etc the water balance equation of a reservoir can be summarized and writes as 1 v t v t 1 q in t q out t u t p t e t s t a t where vt and vt 1 are the volumes of water at any time t and t 1 respectively qin t and qout t are the inflow and outflow volume from the reservoir pt et and st are the depth of precipitation evaporation and seepage from the reservoir and at is the area of the reservoir at time t and ut is the volume of water passes through the waste weir the evaporation et was computed using daily pan evaporation pan coefficient and corresponding water spread while seepage loss was estimated using the standard rate for soil suggested by food and agriculture organization fao https www fao org fishery static fao training fao training general x6705e x6705e02 htm the validation of water balance was carried out on a water year basis from june 01 to may 31 where all inflows and outflows from the system were summed up to determine the change in storage and compared with the change in storage based on reservoir levels if yearly percentage error comes within the range generally 10 it appeared that water balance has considered all major components and runoff computed in this way can be used for modelling purposes this module is useful for the data scares projects where reservoir inflow can be computed from reservoir water balance 2 2 2 module ii future projection of climatic variables and rainfall in the present study sdsm dc software was used for the generation of future series of climatic variables at raipur and rainfall of different rg stations in the tandula complex region in the statistical downscaling technique the climatic variables ci which are not dependent on any intermediate processes are modelled through unconditional multiple linear regression while precipitation pi through a conditional process wilby et al 2001 based on the occurrence of wet day wi using following equations with chosen predictors xij for ith month season 2 c i γ 0 j 1 n γ j x ij e i 3 p i β 0 j 1 n β j x ij e i where γ 0 γ 1 γ j and β 0 β 1 β j are the regression constants for climatic parameters and precipitation respectively ei is the model error computed as a random number of the normal distribution and n is the number of predictors used in the regression in the case of precipitation the wet day occurrence on an ith day can be determined by computing a candidate in a random process generator wi indicates the occurrence of rainfall that varies between 0 and 1 the occurrence of the wet day depends on n number of predictors xij and can be determined by the following equation 4 w i 0 j 1 n j x ij where 0 1 2 n are the constants statistically the precipitation on any day is considered to have occurred if w i r i where ri is a stochastic output of the linear random generator the detail about the application strength and weakness of sdsm can be found in liu et al 2011 fiseha et al 2012 goodess et al 2003 wilby and dettinger 2000 wilby et al 2002 wilby et al 2003 wilby et al 2004 gachon et al 2005 wilby et al 2014 etc the selection of a set of appropriate predictors is an important task in the downscaling process huang et al 2011 and several methods were propagated by different researchers for it benestad et al 2007 shongwe et al 2006 tripathi et al 2006 etc in the study the percentage reduction method pallant 2007 mahmood and babel 2013 2014 jaiswal et al 2017 chaudhary et al 2018 fan et al 2021 jaiswal et al 2021 etc was used to select an appropriate set of predictors in this technique initially the correlation coefficient cc of different predictors with predictand were computed to select the first super predictor exhibiting the highest value the percentage reduction pr can be computed for the rest predictors using the following equation 5 pr p r c c c c where pr is the partial correlation coefficient the predictor having the lowest pr value can be recognized as the second super predictor the process can be repeated with the remaining predictors to select the next super predictors in general one to three predictors are sufficient to model climatic variability chu et al 2010 after selecting a suitable set of predictors the monthly seasonal or annual models have been developed in sdsm using the k fold cross validation technique markatou et al 2005 casanueva et al 2014 in which the first k 1 k part is used in calibration where statistical relationships can be developed with appropriate transformation and model type and remaining 1 k part is used for validation purpose various goodness of fit criteria including coefficient of correlation cc adjusted r2 adj r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 for the monthly sum of rainfall and the monthly average of climate variables rainfall have been computed and used for selection of the best suited model wilcoxon s signed rank test wilcoxon 1945 has been used for uncertainties analysis then the developed models were used to generate multiple series ten series out of which three were used in modules iii and iv for three future assessment periods 2 2 3 module iii rainfall runoff modelling for the catchment of reservoirs in this module the swat model coupled with swat cup application has been used for modelling hydrological processes in the catchment of the reservoir considering its suitability for gauged as well as ungauged catchments the swat model arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2002 neitsch et al 2005 is a physically based semi distributed and continuous time simulation the basin scale model developed to predict the response to natural inputs as well as the manmade interventions and management practices dhar and mazumdar 2006 guug et al 2020 each sub basin in the swat model may have an organization of climate hrus ponds wetlands groundwater and main channel reach draining the basin the runoff volume in the swat model is estimated by the soil conservation services scs curve number technique usda 1972 and the command structure is based on the hymo model williams and hann 1972 the runoff yield computed for individual hru is routed through river network using variable storage or muskingum routing method at outlets of sub watersheds and basins the swat model uses manning s equation to define the rate and flow velocity the infiltration in the swat model can be computed either directly through the green and ampt method or the remaining amount of water from precipitation after generation of daily runoff computed by the scs cn technique the swat model uses land use soil and slope classes to divide the whole area into watersheds sub watersheds and hydrological response units hrus in the present study swat models and swat cup have been used for sensitivity calibration validation and projection of runoff for three future periods the swat cup is a public domain program has several optimization techniques like sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 parameter solution parasol van griensven and meixner 2006 markov chain monte carlo mcmc and particle swarm optimization pso in swat modelling the uncertainty and calibration are carried out to determine the degree to which all uncertainties are accounted for and represented by p factor and r factor in the swat cup application the p factor is a measure to represent how well measured data lie within the bracket of 95 prediction uncertainty 95 ppu and varies between 0 and 100 and prediction error 100 p factor indicates the percentage of data not bracketed by 95ppu arnold et al 2012 the r factor may be defined as the ratio of the average width of the 95ppu band and a standard deviation of observed data generally when the value of the p factor is increased the corresponding r factor is also increased so during calibration a balance between these two is maintained and it is tried to get the maximum value of p factor with the minimum value of r factor and in combination indicate model calibration and uncertainty analysis 2 2 4 module iv assessment of future profile of capacity of reservoirs module iv was designed to perform the task of determination of present capacity by digital image processing of remote sensing data and future revised capacities by empirical area reduction technique for all reservoirs in the tandula complex the digital image classification technology works on the principle that due to the deposition of sediment the water spread of the reservoir is reduced to its original water spread at the same level jaiswal et al 2012 the normalized difference water index ndwi and band ratio followed by slicing can be used to identify water pixels in the images the ndwi and band ratio br for identification of water pixels can be written as 8 ndwi green n i r green n i r where green band ii data nir band iv data of irs 1d p6 satellite 9 br nir green when the total sediment deposition in the reservoir is known the profile can be determined by the empirical area reduction method or the area incremental method the empirical area reduction method is based on the principle that the accumulation and distribution of sediment have a specific relationship with the shape of the reservoir and the parameters c m and n have been suggested by borland and miller 1960 based on the elevation capacity table amini et al 2010 the trial and error method was used to determine new zero elevation and subsequently the revised sediments at different levels for mid year of all future periods for all three reservoirs 2 2 5 module v water management model for scenarios generation the water resource management in reservoirs works on the principle of rule curves and priorities to supply water according to the availability of water future supplies from the catchment and upcoming demands and their importance jaiswal et al 2014b the mike hydro basin can be used for integrated water resources management iwrm decision support system water availability estimation allocation of water among different users irrigation reservoir operation and water quality analysis dhi 2014 visescu et al 2017 santos et al 2019 in the present study separate management models have been developed in the mike hydro basin for the base period bp 1991 2015 near century fp 1 2020 35 mid century fp 2 2046 64 and far century fp 3 2081 99 periods the climate change studies suffered from multidimensional uncertainties of climate forcing mathematical representation incomplete knowledge etc can be characterized and explored by analyzing the results of different types of ensembles of climate model simulations in the study 252 simulation runs were devised through the application of modules ii iii and v to deal with the uncertainties of climate projection 3 series each from 7 projections runoff modelling low best and high runoff generating parameters and adaptation strategies efficiencies of 51 and 60 no and 5 gw use using technocrat views and participatory scoping fig 3 an average of 3 identical runs was taken to devise 84 management plans taken to module vi for performance assessment 2 2 6 module vi decision support for evaluation of performance decision support is an important step in the rdm framework that can be used to assist decision makers to improve the effectiveness of decisions by examining different scenarios janssen 1992 in the present study saaty s ahp based decision support has been proposed and used to analyze the system behavior with the help of six different performance indicators 2 2 6 1 performance indicators the performance of different users has been evaluated using the following six different performance indicators including demand dem deficit def vulnerability vul reliability rel resilience res and sustainability sus the total demand of irrigation command and other users is the amount of water required in a hydrological year to meet all temporally varied needs including losses conveyance and application losses and gains rainfall and moisture etc whereas deficit is the amount of water in a year which the source is unable to meet under defined efficiency operation climatic condition etc several researchers e g smit and pilifosova 2001 hahn et al 2009 pandey et al 2009 dong et al 2015 ipcc 2008 have defined vulnerability in the context of climate change vulnerability is the measure of average depth volume of shortage across the projection on a percentage or friction scale for those periods in which a shortage occurs considering the probability of each event to be equal hirsch 1979 cai et al 2002 hyde et al 2004 masia et al 2018 and can be expressed by the following equation 10 vul 1 m j 1 m def j dem j where m is the number of failure events in which deficit occurs to bring vulnerability onto the same scale of other indicators 1 vul has been used as a performance indicator that measures the average percent or friction demand met when shortages occur the water resource systems are designed to supply variable demands from multiple users under varied supply situations and expressed as a percent of duration generally the month in water resource projects in which the system meets all the demands and no shortage occurs or the relative frequency probability of a system during which it does not face any deficit kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 a system can be considered 100 reliable if no shortages occur in a simulation mcmahon et al 2006 if nf is the number of non failure months in total n months under consideration the following equation can be used for the computation of reliability rel 11 rel j 1 n n f n 100 the concept of resilience introduced by holling in 1973 is one of the most important research areas in the context of sustainability perrings 1998 kates et al 2001 foley et al 2005 anderies et al 2006 folke 2006 resilience may be defined as the capacity of a socio ecological system to absorb or withstand perturbations or disturbances while retaining the same basic structure and functions self organizing capacity and the adaptation capability to the stress and change holling 1973 gunderson and holling 2002 ipcc 2013 and its probability of recovery to a satisfactory state once it entered into an unsatisfactory state hashimoto et al 1982 moy et al 1986 the following equation has been used for the computation of resilience of a user in the system 12 res j 1 n n f n based on an un weighted geometric mean sandoval solis et al 2011 have given the following equation to compute sustainability using the reliability and vulnerability of a system 13 sus r e l 1 v u l r e s 1 3 the different indicators explained earlier may give different results but having their importance when the system is analyzed comprehensively and hence saaty s ahp based decision support has been used to compute the comprehensive performance of the system 2 2 6 2 saaty s ahp for multi criteria decision support the ahp saaty 1980 saaty 2008 ishizaka and labib 2011 uses a multi level hierarchical structure ranking in which complex and the unstructured problem is broken down into different levels of objective criteria sub criterion and alternatives the pairwise comparisons are made between all possible pairs in each cluster matrix which are used to get the weight of the importance of each criterion or alternative within a cluster or level of hierarchy the consistency of decision or pairwise comparison is checked using a consistency ratio useful for checking the consistency of the data which provides a mechanism to improve the consistency of decision jaiswal et al 2013a jaiswal et al 2015 in the present study saaty s ahp has been used by building a hierarchy for the tandula complex system and then analyzed all components to get their subsequent weights for assessment of relative performance for the assessment of the performance of different users commands of tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs and bsp six interrelated performance indicators including demand deficit sustainability vulnerability reliability and resilience were finalized with the consultation of stakeholders for the computation of relative performance index rpi for management plans in the tandula complex system the 3 level hierarchical structure has been used and presented in fig 4 the details of ahp can be seen in the literature han and tsay 1998 jaiswal et al 2013a jaiswal et al 2013b deng et al 2014 bahmani et al 2015 geopel 2018 simson et al 2019 leal 2020 etc 2 2 6 3 relative performance index rpi after determining the respecting weights of performance indicators and different users as per their importance in the system with the help of saaty s ahp a comprehensive index termed as a relative performance index rpi of a management plan was computed using weights of indicators and users along with normalized values of indicators for that scenario since different indicators vary in different ranges it is necessary to convert the variation of these performance indicators in the same range so that no indicator can exert an influence on the decision because of its large variation if pii is the ith indicator having original upper and lower values as piou and piol respectively while pinu and pinl are new upper and lower bound in which the series of the indicator of pii needs to be normalized the normalized value pini of the ith element of indicator series pii can be determined using the following equation 16 pi ni pi nu pi nl pi ou pi ol pi i pi ol in the present study all the performance indicators have been normalized in the range of 0 to 1 and hence the above equation 16 was modified and given below 17 pi ni pi i pi ol pi ou pi ol after normalizing the indicators the weighted sum of all indicators and water users and their performance indicators were used to compute the relative performance index rpi as a general case for assessment of the impact of climate change on a water resource project the problem can be broken into a three layered hierarchical structure with a relative performance index on top on the second layer there may be n number of water users uj with saaty s ahp weight of wuj for the jth water user in the decision tree performance indicators may on the bottom layer where m number of performance indicators having weights wpk for kth performance indicator the normalized value of the kth indicator of the jth user for ith scenario plan and can be expressed by npij k i the relative performance index rpii of the project for the ith scenario plan can be computed with the help of the following equation 18 rpi i j 1 n wu j k 1 m wp k npi j k i the relative performance index for a scenario plan has been computed as the weighted sum of the multiplication of users and indicators in a hierarchal manner if wdem wdef wrel wsus wvul and wres are the weights of demand deficit reliability sustainability vulnerability and resilience respectively and tdemni tdefni trelni tsusni tvulni and tresni are the normalized values of demand deficit reliability sustainability vulnerability and resilience respectively of a user say tandula for the ith scenario the performance index of a user such as tandula user tpii for the ith scenario has been computed using the following equation 19 tpi i w dem 1 dem ni w def 1 def ni w rel rel ni w sus sus ni w vul 1 vul ni w res res ni similarly by replacing the values of performance indicators for the i th scenario in equation 19 the performance index respectively for other users can be computed in the last step the relative performance index rpii for the ith plan can be computed using the following equation 20 rpi i w tan tpi i w khar k pi i w gon gpi i w bsp bpi i where wtan wkhar wgon and wbsp are the weights of different users in the tandula complex system the future relative performance has been compared with baseline performance to determine vulnerable plans and adaptive measures for sustainable water resource management under climate change 3 results and discussion the basic aim of this study was to develop a dss framework for data scares complex water resource system for developing management strategies under different climatic scenarios further the developed dss framework was applied to evaluate robust management strategies for the tandula complex system to deal with future climate and other uncertainties for three future assessment periods i e near century as fp 1 2020 35 mid century as fp 2 2046 64 and far century as 2081 99 the rdm framework follows the principles of participatory dialogue identification of all possible uncertainties generation of the spectrum of scenarios determination of key vulnerabilities and lastly to decide robust adaptive strategies a systematic deliberation with all stakeholders continuous discussion with water resource managers and two meetings with farmers in each command has been made and based on data availability and literature survey the xlrm x exogenous uncertainties l policy levers r relationships m measures matrix has been prepared which was used as guidelines for robust decision making table 2 the application of the dss framework considering multiple adaptive management scenarios for tandula complex and their performance during three future assessment periods with the aid of six interconnected modules is described below 3 1 module i water balance of reservoirs the water balance of tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs has been carried out to determine daily inflows from these catchments using reservoir levels outflows from canals spills inflows from other catchments rainfall evaporation and seepage from reservoirs the water balance analysis has been carried out from 1991 to 2015 for tandula and gondli reservoirs while from 1994 to 2015 for the kharkhara reservoir from the analysis it has been observed that percentage errors in water balance varied in the range of 6 87 to 4 04 for the tandula reservoir 7 06 to 8 91 for the kharkhara reservoir and 7 78 to 6 60 for the gondli reservoir as percentage errors in different water years came out reasonably well within the range less than 10 of inflow the inflow computed from the water balance of reservoirs can be used in module iii for rainfall runoff modelling the seepage and evaporation are the major losses in these reservoirs depend on the area of contact and water spread respectively the results of water balance for reservoirs indicated average annual inflow as 483 202 8 mcm from tandula 273 77 4 mcm from kharkhara and 128 48 2 mcm from gondli catchment different components of the water balance of tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs have been presented in fig 5 3 2 module ii projection of climatic variables and rainfall in module ii the statistical downscaling model sdsm dc has been used to project climatic variables including minimum temperature maximum temperature relative humidity wind speed sunshine hour evaporation of raipur climate station and rainfall of five rain gauge stations namely ambagarh balod bhanpura gondli and chamra falling in the study area the list of selected predictors model type transformation and goodness of fit measures for different climatic variables and rainfall of rg stations has been presented in table 3 the gcms output cannot be applied directly because of the perceived mismatch of scale easterling et al 2001 and therefore uncertainty analysis of proposed models has been carried out using wilcoxon s signed rank test and found no significant uncertainty in the proposed models after successful calibration validation and uncertainty analysis the developed models were used to generate multiple series 10 for each from seven climate forcing conditions including a1b and a2 scenarios from cgcm3 rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 from canesm and a2 and b2 scenarios from hadcm3 gcms for three future assessment periods as fp 1 2020 2035 fp 2 2046 2081 and fp 3 2081 2100 the downscaling of minimum temperature confirmed an increase of minimum temperature in october to december may demand more irrigation water for kharif crops in the region the maximum temperature showed an increasing trend in all the months except december and require more water to meet the demands of different users and the intense heatwave in june due to the considerable increase of maximum temperature number of days where the temperature may exceed from 44 c the wind speed will decrease in all the months except december sunshine hours will decrease in all the months except april month while relative humidity and pan evaporation may increase or decrease in different months in the future the anomaly of climate variables and rainfall at different rg stations for different assessment periods and presented in figs 6 a and 6 b from the analysis it has been observed that most of the scenarios confirmed a reduced rainfall at ambagarh bhanpura balod and gondli rg station except a2 and b2 scenarios of hadcm3 gcm no concluding pattern was observed at chamra rg station due to increasing as well as decreasing seasonal rainfall through different scenarios 3 3 module iii rainfall runoff models for the catchment of reservoirs the swat model for the catchments of tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoir has been set up using aster dem land use from liss iii data and soil maps from nbsslup nagpur the catchments of tandula and kharkhara reservoirs were infested mainly by deciduous forest while gondli is an agricultural watershed the land use soil and swat model setup of different catchments have been depicted in figs 7 a to 7 c the tandula kharkhara and gondli catchments were divided into 12 9 and 6 sub basins respectively by inserting outlets manually the tandula catchment has 444 hrus kharkhara has 195 while gondli being the smallest catchment has 170 hrus the developed swat models were imported into the swat cup application for sensitivity calibration and validation analysis in the present study the most commonly used technique sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 algorithm has been used for the analysis the full details of the swat cup can be seen in abbaspour et al 2007 the t stat and p value have been used to identify a set of most sensitive parameters in each catchment the scs curve number was found the most sensitive parameter for all three catchments with the increase of p factor the r factor also increases hence an effort has been made to get p factor more than 70 along with a low r factor for runoff abbaspour 2015 various goodness of fit criteria along with a 95ppu graph of these catchments during calibration and validation have been depicted in table 4 and figs 8 a to 8 c respectively after getting satisfactory performance during calibration and validation the developed swat model for tandula kharkhara and gondli catchments were used to generate runoff series for the near century fp 1 2020 35 mid century fp 2 2046 64 and far century fp 3 2081 99 periods 3 4 module iv present and projected revised capacities of reservoirs to assess revised capacities nine different remote sensing scenes of the liss iii sensor of path 102 and row 58 for satellite irs 1d p6 have been analyzed for the detection of water spread areas at different elevations the fcc and extracted water spread at a level of tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs are presented in fig 9 from the analysis it has been found that tandula reservoir has lost 24 75 mcm of gross storage 8 02 during 93 years from 1922 to 2015 kharkhara lost 8 41 mcm 4 96 during 51 years from 1967 to 2017 and gondli lost 7 21 mcm 7 26 during 60 years from 1956 to 2015 the rates of sediment in tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs have been worked out as 0 032 0 043 and 0 068 mcm 100 sq km year respectively the rate amount of sediment slope type of reservoir and constants c m and n of empirical area reduction techniques for different reservoirs are presented in table 5 the original and revised capacities in three future periods for tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs are presented in figs 10 a to 10 c respectively 3 5 module v water management model for simulation of management plans in module v a management model in the mike hydro basin for the tandula complex was prepared to allocate water for different users in the basin under a set of constraints and priorities the data collected from diverse sources and literature including elevation area capacity table reservoir characteristics levels priorities operation criteria efficiencies and losses groundwater situation were used for setting up the model the designed cropping pattern of tandula kharkhara and gondli commands consist of 82095 ha 6073 ha and 4980 ha kharif paddy respectively where water is supplied from the system the textural retention and hydrological properties of soil play an important role in planning irrigation releases the soils have been grouped into five different classes namely sg 1 to sg 5 tamgadge et al 2002 and kumar et al 2015 and used as inputs in the mike hydro basin model table 6 the mike hydro basin model for the tandula complex system is depicted in fig 11 in the study four separate models have been developed for the base period 1991 2015 and future periods by making necessary changes in the time series and period of simulation a total of 252 simulation runs were made for each future assessment period and described in table 7 the simulation result of the mike hydro basin provided demand supply and deficit at all user nodes along with reservoir levels and storages at a specified time interval daily time scale here the outputs of simulations for the base period and a future scenario are presented in figs 12 a and 12 b from the analysis of simulation results it has been observed that the average demand during the base period may vary from 204 7 to 205 1 mcm for tandula command 18 5 mcm for kharkhara command 17 mcm for gondli command and 40 6 mcm for bsp as three random series for each downscaled gcms were used in the management model the average of demand supply and deficits of three ensembles with identical uncertainty conditions and management strategies were computed that reduced 252 simulation runs to 84 management scenarios with nomenclature as ms 1 to ms 84 these 84 management plans were forwarded to saaty s ahp based decision support system under the rdm framework the graphical representation of demand and deficit of different scenarios along with the base period demand is presented in fig 13 3 6 module vi decision support for evaluation of performance the last module in the framework of robust decision making is the development of decision support to evaluate the recital of the system under different climatic scenarios adaptation options and management measures the simulation results were analyzed to compute different performance indicators pis for all users separately and used in saaty s ahp based decision support for computation relative performance indices rpis of the tandula system 3 6 1 application of saaty s ahp based decision support the performance indicators pis of different users in all 84 management scenarios in each future period have been taken to saaty s ahp decision support for computation of relative performance index rpi 3 6 1 1 computation of weights for indicators the saaty s ahp was constructed with the help of a comparison matrix which ultimately provided weights of different components of decision making with the consistency ratio to adjudge the adequacy of decision among different indicators saaty s ahp decision support conferred a maximum weight of 0 41 for demand deficit while the average demand of any user attained the lowest weight of 0 04 similarly it has been observed that tandula kharkhara and gondli commands and bsp industrial users attained weights as 0 56 0 28 0 12 and 0 04 respectively 3 6 1 2 computation of relative performance index rpi for the development of decision support for the tandula complex the performance of the system has been broken into a three layered hierarchical structure with the goal of relative performance on top four different users including commands of tandula kharkhara gondli and bsp on the second layer and six performance indicators including average demand deficit sustainability reliability vulnerability and resilience on the bottom after the computation of weights of different performance indicators and users from saaty s ahp the relative performance index rpi for 84 different scenarios have been computed for the near century 2020 35 mid century 2046 64 and far century 2081 99 periods under rdm framework the graphical representations of the performance of different scenarios using percentage change of average rainfall in the region with base period rainfall and relative performance indices far near mid and far century periods are presented in figs 14 a to 14 c from the analysis it has been observed that relative performance of the base period varies between 0 63 and 0 65 during the future period when compared with scenarios of those periods and hence 0 65 has been considered as the benchmark performance for the selection of safe and unsafe plans in different periods the percentage change in regional rainfall for a scenario from base period rainfall was computed by taking the seasonal average of all rain gauges in the study area the list of safe and unsafe scenarios during different future assessment periods is presented in tables 8 a to 8 c out of 84 scenarios examined for each period 41 scenarios during fp 1 2020 35 54 scenarios during fp 2 2046 64 and 46 scenarios during fp 3 2081 99 were found below benchmark level need development of additional adaptation measures to cope up plausible climate change condition in the region the suggested adaptive measures are to take proper steps to increase irrigation efficiency by pipe and sprinkler system change cropping pattern considering the available water select paddy crops having low water requirement consider water transfer through interlinking of rivers conjunctive use of surface and groundwater etc 4 summary the present study has been undertaken to develop a dss framework to classify uncertainties and water resources management options using participatory scoping of scenarios analysis for robust decision making further the developed dss framework has been applied on tandula reservoir complex to develop management scenarios plans under rdm framework where there is deep uncertainties of climate change and modelling along with management strategies for water resource project having complex water transfer and non availability of measured data the proposed framework consists of six interconnected modules devised based on the xlrm matrix with the active participation of farmers water resource managers and technocrats in the tandula complex system situated in the chhattisgarh state of india the problem of non availability of runoff data was sorted out with the aid of the water balance model for all three reservoirs tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs by computing all the input and output components the projection of future climate in the region confirmed an increase of minimum temperature in the winter months of october to december the maximum temperature will increase in all the months except december with the maximum rise in june during all three future assessment periods the future projection of mean seasonal rainfall from multiple projections of the third generation gcms confirmed reduced rainfall in all rg stations during all three assessment periods except balod where rainfall may increase during the near century period among several models the swat model has been used because of its wide applicability in gauged as well as ungauged catchments the sensitivity analysis suggested that the runoff curve number cn2 is the most sensitive parameter for these catchments it may be concluded from large sets of multiple generated runoff series that the projected average yearly water availability will be reduced in kharkhara and gondli reservoirs in all three future periods the tandula reservoir may receive similar runoff during the mid century period and reduced runoff during the near and far century period the mike hydro basin model for the tandula system was developed and four simulations for the base period bp 1981 2015 and 252 different simulations for each future assessment period were made to deal with all sorts of uncertainties and management options the results of different simulations confirmed that under the uncertainties of modelling and climate change the average yearly water demand of tandula and kharkhara commands will increase in all three future assessment periods the water demand for the gondli command may remain similar in the future the water deficit will also increase in the future when compared with the base period corresponding values for all the users in the system in the decision support for the tandula complex system the tandula command has got the maximum weight among all the users while average yearly demand can be considered the most important performance indicator in the analysis 252 simulation runs were reduced to 84 management scenarios by taking the average of three identical simulations for assessment of relative performance during each future assessment period the relative performance of different management scenarios concluded that more than half of management scenarios out of 84 management scenarios evaluated for each of three future assessment periods may not be able to match the base period performance of the system most of the management scenarios based on low runoff generating parameters failed to meet the demands of users in the system however in the case of best and high predicting runoff scenarios the suggested adaptation strategies of increasing efficiencies and conjunctive use make the system sustainable under the impact of future climate change the mid century period fp 2 will be the most critical period where more than 60 of management scenarios will not be able to perform up to the requisite level the probable reason behind these failures may be the increase in temperature and reduction in the amount and non uniform distribution of rainfall the proposed dss framework enables the development of various scenarios and supports robust decision making under future climatic projections particularly for complex water resources projects 5 conclusions water resource planning development and management have proven problematic owing to the potential implications of short and long term climate change on water supplies socio technical problems and data scarcity a scientific approach withstakeholder participation and the integration of modelling tools for decision making allows for a better knowledge of water resource systems as well as the formulation of future scenarios and management options in the face of climate change the developed dss framework in this research allows for the analysis of management plans with climate uncertainties for complex water resources projects with data scarcity the performance of the developed plans was evaluated using multi criteria decision support in the three layer hierarchal process the developed dss framework provides a solution for strategic water resources planning and management under projected climate scenarios in a basin having problems of scarcity surplus and non uniform distribution of surface water using the participation of farmers technocrats and water resource managers this paper has successfully demonstrated the application of the dss framework for robust decision making in water resources planning and management credit

decision support for the assessment of the performance of multiple management plans designed for three future assessment periods of 2020 35 2046 64 and 2081 99 the proposed framework was applied to the tandula complex system of chhattisgarh state of india consists of three reservoirs namely tandula kharkhara and gondli having water transfer in their commands and for industrial use the developed dss framework provides the opportunity to analyze the management plans with climate uncertainties for the complex water resources projects having data scarcity here in the present paper the developed dss framework incorporates eighty four diverse management plans devised from constant interaction with stakeholders and technocrats resulting to deal with climate uncertainties using possible improvement in efficiencies and consumptive use for three future assessment periods furthermore the performance of the developed plans was evaluated using multi criteria decision support in the three layer hierarchal process the decision support analysis suggested that the second assessment period fp 2 2046 64 will be more crucial from the management point of view where 54 out of 81 plans could not perform as par with the present performance of the system the developed dss framework provides a solution for strategic water resources planning and management under projected climate scenarios in

concluded that robust decision making rdm and decision scaling ds are easy for approaching a decision and prioritize adaptation strategies than other decision making processes the adaptation studies for water resource management require a holistic approach with participatory scoping of all actors and technical explanations with the support of a strong database and appropriate modelling approach upadhyay 2016 assessing the true availability of water certainly use to be the key factor for assuring optimum planning and management of water both at the catchment and the command area level where availability of hydrological data is of fundamental importance ireson et al 2006 in the absence of measured runoff and sediment data adopting the reservoir based water balancing approach to understand and regulate supply or demand and remote sensing approach for estimation of revised capacities hold high value for semi arid regions like that of india in this paper a framework of dss has been proposed with the aid of multiple modules for development and evaluation of several management plans under future climatic scenarios further its potential has been demonstrated for a data scares complex water resource project in india considering future periods namely the near century period from 2020 to 35 fp 1 the mid century period from 2046 to 64 fp 2 and the far century period from 2081 to 99 fp 3 2 materials and method 2 1 study area and data used the proposed dss framework has been applied to the tandula complex system in the chhattisgarh state of india having three dams namely tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs these reservoirs supply irrigation water to their own and other reservoirs commands and industrial water supply to bhilai steel plant bsp situated in industrial city bhilai the paddy is the only crop in all three commands where irrigation water is supplied from tandula complex system during kharif season ambagarh balod bhanpura chamra and gondli rain gauge rg stations are situated in and around these catchments the location map of the tandula complex is presented in fig 1 a while water transfer in fig 1 b the detailed information about tandula kharkhara

catchment was performed from aster dem obtained from https asterweb jpl nasa gov gdem asp in the study constant interaction with farmers engineers water resource managers and technocrats was made to get new plans strategies 2 2 methodology existing water resource projects in developing countries like india are under increasing pressure due to depleting water resources and increased demand as a result of the rising population and repercussions of climate change the implications of climate change on availability and demand necessitate the formulation of long term policies based on future climatic scenarios now there is a growing understanding of the need to aim for long term developmental outcomes from irrigation such as more productive water usage climatic resilience and environmental sustainability rather than just irrigation efficiency implementation of adaptation strategies on the other hand is challenging due to thelack of sufficient data and information inadequate knowledge and a reluctance to adopt innovation and technology among various stakeholders to address issues of water resources management holistically aframework proposed in this paper considers inflow computation from reservoir water balances reservoir sediment efficient modelling and management strategies and a comprehensive assessment of future scenario performance using a robust decision support system the methodology for the suggested framework consists of the development of different modules and their links based on constant interaction with stakeholders managers and technocrats to consider data problems uncertainties social constraints and possible future interventions with participatory scoping based on the feedback received on perceived uncertainties and management options six interrelated modules have been designed and presented in fig 2 the concept and methodology adopted for these modules are described in the next sections 2 2 1 module i water balance of reservoirs in developing countries the availability of runoff data is limited and gauging generally stopped after the construction of dams in such a situation the water balance can be used as an alternative to computing runoff from the catchment the hydrologic balance in the case of water bodies provides stored water in controlled section and inflows from the basin using a simple mass balance where the sum of all outflows deducted from the sum of inflows provides the change in stored volume over a specific period sokolov and chapman 1974 thomann and mueller 1987 chapra 1997 fetter 2001 aparicio 2005 iaea 2007 d urquiza diaz et al 2009 etc the water balance equation of a reservoir can be summarized and writes as 1 v t v t 1 q in t q out t u t p t e t s t a t where vt and vt 1 are the volumes of water at any time t and t 1 respectively qin t and qout t are the inflow and outflow volume from the reservoir pt et and st are the depth of precipitation evaporation and seepage from the reservoir and at is the area of the reservoir at time t and ut is the volume of water passes through the waste weir the evaporation et was computed using daily pan evaporation pan coefficient and corresponding water spread while seepage loss was estimated using the standard rate for soil suggested by food and agriculture organization fao https www fao org fishery static fao training fao training general x6705e x6705e02 htm the validation of water balance was carried out on a water year basis from june 01 to may 31 where all inflows and outflows from the system were summed up to determine the change in storage and compared with the change in storage based on reservoir levels if yearly percentage error comes within the range generally 10 it appeared that water balance has considered all major components and runoff computed in this way can be used for modelling purposes this module is useful for the data scares projects where reservoir inflow can be computed from reservoir water balance 2 2 2 module ii future projection of climatic variables and rainfall in the present study sdsm dc software was used for the generation of future series of climatic variables at raipur and rainfall of different rg stations in the tandula complex region in the statistical downscaling technique the climatic variables ci which are not dependent on any intermediate processes are modelled through unconditional multiple linear regression while precipitation pi through a conditional process wilby et al 2001 based on the occurrence of wet day wi using following equations with chosen predictors xij for ith month season 2 c i γ 0 j 1 n γ j x ij e i 3 p i β 0 j 1 n β j x ij e i where γ 0 γ 1 γ j and β 0 β 1 β j are the regression constants for climatic parameters and precipitation respectively ei is the model error computed as a random number of the normal distribution and n is the number of predictors used in the regression in the case of precipitation the wet day occurrence on an ith day can be determined by computing a candidate in a random process generator wi indicates the occurrence of rainfall that varies between 0 and 1 the occurrence of the wet day depends on n number of predictors xij and can be determined by the following equation 4 w i 0 j 1 n j x ij where 0 1 2 n are the constants statistically the precipitation on any day is considered to have occurred if w i r i where ri is a stochastic output of the linear random generator the detail about the application strength and weakness of sdsm can be found in liu et al 2011 fiseha et al 2012 goodess et al 2003 wilby and dettinger 2000 wilby et al 2002 wilby et al 2003 wilby et al 2004 gachon et al 2005 wilby et al 2014 etc the selection of a set of appropriate predictors is an important task in the downscaling process huang et al 2011 and several methods were propagated by different researchers for it benestad et al 2007 shongwe et al 2006 tripathi et al 2006 etc in the study the percentage reduction method pallant 2007 mahmood and babel 2013 2014 jaiswal et al 2017 chaudhary et al 2018 fan et al 2021 jaiswal et al 2021 etc was used to select an appropriate set of predictors in this technique initially the correlation coefficient cc of different predictors with predictand were computed to select the first super predictor exhibiting the highest value the percentage reduction pr can be computed for the rest predictors using the following equation 5 pr p r c c c c where pr is the partial correlation coefficient the predictor having the lowest pr value can be recognized as the second super predictor the process can be repeated with the remaining predictors to select the next super predictors in general one to three predictors are sufficient to model climatic variability chu et al 2010 after selecting a suitable set of predictors the monthly seasonal or annual models have been developed in sdsm using the k fold cross validation technique markatou et al 2005 casanueva et al 2014 in which the first k 1 k part is used in calibration where statistical relationships can be developed with appropriate transformation and model type and remaining 1 k part is used for validation purpose various goodness of fit criteria including coefficient of correlation cc adjusted r2 adj r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 for the monthly sum of rainfall and the monthly average of climate variables rainfall have been computed and used for selection of the best suited model wilcoxon s signed rank test wilcoxon 1945 has been used for uncertainties analysis then the developed models were used to generate multiple series ten series out of which three were used in modules iii and iv for three future assessment periods 2 2 3 module iii rainfall runoff modelling for the catchment of reservoirs in this module the swat model coupled with swat cup application has been used for modelling hydrological processes in the catchment of the reservoir considering its suitability for gauged as well as ungauged catchments the swat model arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2002 neitsch et al 2005 is a physically based semi distributed and continuous time simulation the basin scale model developed to predict the response to natural inputs as well as the manmade interventions and management practices dhar and mazumdar 2006 guug et al 2020 each sub basin in the swat model may have an organization of climate hrus ponds wetlands groundwater and main channel reach draining the basin the runoff volume in the swat model is estimated by the soil conservation services scs curve number technique usda 1972 and the command structure is based on the hymo model williams and hann 1972 the runoff yield computed for individual hru is routed through river network using variable storage or muskingum routing method at outlets of sub watersheds and basins the swat model uses manning s equation to define the rate and flow velocity the infiltration in the swat model can be computed either directly through the green and ampt method or the remaining amount of water from precipitation after generation of daily runoff computed by the scs cn technique the swat model uses land use soil and slope classes to divide the whole area into watersheds sub watersheds and hydrological response units hrus in the present study swat models and swat cup have been used for sensitivity calibration validation and projection of runoff for three future periods the swat cup is a public domain program has several optimization techniques like sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 parameter solution parasol van griensven and meixner 2006 markov chain monte carlo mcmc and particle swarm optimization pso in swat modelling the uncertainty and calibration are carried out to determine the degree to which all uncertainties are accounted for and represented by p factor and r factor in the swat cup application the p factor is a measure to represent how well measured data lie within the bracket of 95 prediction uncertainty 95 ppu and varies between 0 and 100 and prediction error 100 p factor indicates the percentage of data not bracketed by 95ppu arnold et al 2012 the r factor may be defined as the ratio of the average width of the 95ppu band and a standard deviation of observed data generally when the value of the p factor is increased the corresponding r factor is also increased so during calibration a balance between these two is maintained and it is tried to get the maximum value of p factor with the minimum value of r factor and in combination indicate model calibration and uncertainty analysis 2 2 4 module iv assessment of future profile of capacity of reservoirs module iv was designed to perform the task of determination of present capacity by digital image processing of remote sensing data and future revised capacities by empirical area reduction technique for all reservoirs in the tandula complex the digital image classification technology works on the principle that due to the deposition of sediment the water spread of the reservoir is reduced to its original water spread at the same level jaiswal et al 2012 the normalized difference water index ndwi and band ratio followed by slicing can be used to identify water pixels in the images the ndwi and band ratio br for identification of water pixels can be written as 8 ndwi green n i r green n i r where green band ii data nir band iv data of irs 1d p6 satellite 9 br nir green when the total sediment deposition in the reservoir is known the profile can be determined by the empirical area reduction method or the area incremental method the empirical area reduction method is based on the principle that the accumulation and distribution of sediment have a specific relationship with the shape of the reservoir and the parameters c m and n have been suggested by borland and miller 1960 based on the elevation capacity table amini et al 2010 the trial and error method was used to determine new zero elevation and subsequently the revised sediments at different levels for mid year of all future periods for all three reservoirs 2 2 5 module v water management model for scenarios generation the water resource management in reservoirs works on the principle of rule curves and priorities to supply water according to the availability of water future supplies from the catchment and upcoming demands and their importance jaiswal et al 2014b the mike

decision makers to improve the effectiveness of decisions by examining different scenarios janssen 1992 in the present study saaty s ahp based decision support has been proposed and used to analyze the system behavior with the help of six different performance indicators 2 2 6 1 performance indicators the performance of different users has been evaluated using the following six different performance indicators including demand dem deficit def vulnerability vul reliability rel resilience res and sustainability sus the total demand of irrigation command and other users is the amount of water required in a hydrological year to meet all temporally varied needs including losses conveyance and application losses and gains rainfall and moisture etc whereas deficit is the amount of water in a year which the source is unable to meet under defined efficiency operation climatic condition etc several researchers e g smit and pilifosova 2001 hahn et al 2009 pandey et al 2009 dong et al 2015 ipcc 2008 have defined vulnerability in the context of climate change vulnerability is the measure of average depth volume of shortage across the projection on a percentage or friction scale for those periods in which a shortage occurs considering the probability of each event to be equal hirsch 1979 cai et al 2002 hyde et al 2004 masia et al 2018 and can be expressed by the following equation 10 vul 1 m j 1 m def j dem j where m is the number of failure events in which deficit occurs to bring vulnerability onto the same scale of other indicators 1 vul has been used as a performance indicator that measures the average percent or friction demand met when shortages occur the water resource systems are designed to supply variable demands from multiple users under varied supply situations and expressed as a percent of duration generally the month in water resource projects in which the system meets all the demands and no shortage occurs or the relative frequency probability of a system during which it does not face any deficit kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 a system can be considered 100 reliable if no shortages occur in a simulation mcmahon et al 2006 if nf is the number of non failure months in total n months under consideration the following equation can be used for the computation of reliability rel 11 rel j 1 n n f n 100 the concept of resilience introduced by holling in 1973 is one of the most important research areas in the context of sustainability perrings 1998 kates et al 2001 foley et al 2005 anderies et al 2006 folke 2006 resilience may be defined as the capacity of a socio ecological system to absorb or withstand perturbations or disturbances while retaining the same basic structure and functions self organizing capacity and the adaptation capability to the stress and change holling 1973 gunderson and holling 2002 ipcc 2013 and its probability of recovery to a satisfactory state once it entered into an unsatisfactory state hashimoto et al 1982 moy et al 1986 the following equation has been used for the computation of resilience of a user in the system 12 res j 1 n n f n based on an un weighted geometric mean sandoval solis et al 2011 have given the following equation to compute sustainability using the reliability and vulnerability of a system 13 sus r e l 1 v u l r e s 1 3 the different indicators explained earlier may give different results but having their importance when the system is analyzed comprehensively and hence saaty s ahp based decision support has been used to compute the comprehensive performance of the system 2 2 6 2 saaty s ahp for multi criteria decision support the ahp saaty 1980 saaty 2008 ishizaka and labib 2011 uses a multi level hierarchical structure ranking in which complex and the unstructured problem is broken down into different levels of objective criteria sub criterion and alternatives the pairwise comparisons are made between all possible pairs in each cluster matrix which are used to get the weight of the importance of each criterion or alternative within a cluster or level of hierarchy the consistency of decision or pairwise comparison is checked using a consistency ratio useful for checking the consistency of the data which provides a mechanism to improve the consistency of decision jaiswal et al 2013a jaiswal et al 2015 in the present study saaty s ahp has been used by building a hierarchy for the tandula complex system and then analyzed all components to get their subsequent weights for assessment of relative performance for the assessment of the performance of different users commands of tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs and bsp six interrelated performance indicators including demand deficit sustainability vulnerability reliability and resilience were finalized with the consultation of stakeholders for the computation of relative performance index rpi for management plans in the tandula complex system the 3 level hierarchical structure has been used and presented in fig 4 the details of ahp can be seen in the literature han and tsay 1998 jaiswal et al 2013a jaiswal et al 2013b deng et al 2014 bahmani et al 2015 geopel 2018 simson et al 2019 leal 2020 etc 2 2 6 3 relative performance index rpi after determining the respecting weights of performance indicators and different users as per their importance in the system with the help of saaty s ahp a comprehensive index termed as a relative performance index rpi of a management plan was computed using weights of indicators and users along with normalized values of indicators for that scenario since different indicators vary in different ranges it is necessary to convert the variation of these performance indicators in the same range so that no indicator can exert an influence on the decision because of its large variation if pii is the ith indicator having original upper and lower values as piou and piol respectively while pinu and pinl are new upper and lower bound in which the series of the indicator of pii needs to be normalized the normalized value pini of the ith element of indicator series pii can be determined using the following equation 16 pi ni pi nu pi nl pi ou pi ol pi i pi ol in the present study all the performance indicators have been normalized in the range of 0 to 1 and hence the above equation 16 was modified and given below 17 pi ni pi i pi ol pi ou pi ol after normalizing the indicators the weighted sum of all indicators and water users and their performance indicators were used to compute the relative performance index rpi as a general case for assessment of the impact of climate change on a water resource project the problem can be broken into a three layered hierarchical structure with a relative performance index on top on the second layer there may be n number of water users uj with saaty s ahp weight of wuj for the jth water user in the decision tree performance indicators may on the bottom layer where m number of performance indicators having weights wpk for kth performance indicator the normalized value of the kth indicator of the jth user for ith scenario plan and can be expressed by npij k i the relative performance index rpii of the project for the ith scenario plan can be computed with the help of the following equation 18 rpi i j 1 n wu j k 1 m wp k npi j k i the relative performance index for a scenario plan has been computed as the weighted sum of the multiplication of users and indicators in a hierarchal manner if wdem wdef wrel wsus wvul and wres are the weights of demand deficit reliability sustainability vulnerability and resilience respectively and tdemni tdefni trelni tsusni tvulni and tresni are the normalized values of demand deficit reliability sustainability vulnerability and resilience respectively of a user say tandula for the ith scenario the performance index of a user such as tandula user tpii for the ith scenario has been computed using the following equation 19 tpi i w dem 1 dem ni w def 1 def ni w rel rel ni w sus sus ni w vul 1 vul ni w res res ni similarly by replacing the values of performance indicators for the i

equation 20 rpi i w tan tpi i w khar k pi i w gon gpi i w bsp bpi i where wtan wkhar wgon and wbsp are the weights of different users in the tandula complex system the future relative performance has been compared with baseline performance to determine vulnerable plans and adaptive measures for sustainable water resource management under climate change 3 results and discussion the basic aim of this study was to develop a dss framework for data scares complex water resource system for developing management strategies under different climatic scenarios further the developed dss framework was applied to evaluate robust management strategies for the tandula complex system to deal with future climate and other uncertainties for three future assessment periods i e near century as fp 1 2020 35 mid century as fp 2 2046 64 and far century as 2081 99 the rdm framework follows the principles of participatory dialogue identification of all possible uncertainties generation of the spectrum of scenarios determination of key vulnerabilities and lastly to decide robust adaptive strategies a systematic deliberation with all stakeholders continuous discussion with water resource managers and two meetings with farmers in each command has been made and based on data availability and literature survey the xlrm x exogenous uncertainties l policy levers r relationships m measures matrix has been prepared which was used as guidelines for robust decision making table 2 the application of the dss framework considering multiple adaptive management scenarios for tandula complex and their performance during three future assessment periods with the aid of six interconnected modules is described below 3 1 module i water balance of reservoirs the water balance of tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs has been carried out to determine daily inflows from these catchments using reservoir levels outflows from canals spills inflows from other catchments rainfall evaporation and seepage from reservoirs the water balance analysis has been carried out from 1991 to 2015 for tandula and gondli reservoirs while from 1994 to 2015 for the kharkhara reservoir from the analysis it has been observed that percentage errors in water balance varied in the range of 6 87 to 4 04 for the tandula reservoir 7 06 to 8 91 for the kharkhara reservoir and 7 78 to 6 60 for the gondli reservoir as percentage errors in different water years came out reasonably well within the range less than 10 of inflow the inflow computed from the water balance of reservoirs can be used in module iii for rainfall runoff modelling the seepage and evaporation are the major losses in these reservoirs depend on the area of contact and water spread respectively the results of water balance for reservoirs indicated average annual inflow as 483 202 8 mcm from tandula 273 77 4 mcm from kharkhara and 128 48 2 mcm from gondli catchment different components of the water balance of tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs have been presented in fig 5 3 2 module ii projection of climatic variables and rainfall in module ii the statistical downscaling model sdsm dc has been used to project climatic variables including minimum temperature maximum temperature relative humidity wind speed sunshine hour evaporation of raipur climate station and rainfall of five rain gauge stations namely ambagarh balod bhanpura gondli and chamra falling in the study area the list of selected predictors model type transformation and goodness of fit measures for different climatic variables and rainfall of rg stations has been presented in table 3 the gcms output cannot be applied directly because of the perceived mismatch of scale easterling et al 2001 and therefore uncertainty analysis of proposed models has been carried out using wilcoxon s signed rank test and found no significant uncertainty in the proposed models after successful calibration validation and uncertainty analysis the developed models were used to generate multiple series 10 for each from seven climate forcing conditions including a1b and a2 scenarios from cgcm3 rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 from canesm and a2 and b2 scenarios from hadcm3 gcms for three future assessment periods as fp 1 2020 2035 fp 2 2046 2081 and fp 3 2081 2100 the downscaling of minimum temperature confirmed an increase of minimum temperature in october to december may demand more irrigation water for kharif crops in the region the maximum temperature showed an increasing trend in all the months except december and require more water to meet the demands of different users and the intense heatwave in june due to the considerable increase of maximum temperature number of days where the temperature may exceed from 44 c the wind speed will decrease in all the months except december sunshine hours will decrease in all the months except april month while relative humidity and pan evaporation may increase or decrease in different months in the future the anomaly of climate variables and rainfall at different rg stations for different assessment periods and presented in figs 6 a and 6 b from the analysis it has been observed that most of the scenarios confirmed a reduced rainfall at ambagarh bhanpura balod and gondli rg station except a2 and b2 scenarios of hadcm3 gcm no concluding pattern was observed at chamra rg station due to increasing as well as decreasing seasonal rainfall through different scenarios 3 3 module iii rainfall runoff models for the catchment of reservoirs the swat model for the catchments of tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoir has been set up using aster dem land use from liss iii data and soil maps from nbsslup nagpur the catchments of tandula and kharkhara reservoirs were infested mainly by deciduous forest while gondli is an agricultural watershed the land use soil and swat model setup of different catchments have been depicted in figs 7 a to 7 c the tandula kharkhara and gondli catchments were divided into 12 9 and 6 sub basins respectively by inserting outlets manually the tandula catchment has 444 hrus kharkhara has 195 while gondli being the smallest catchment has 170 hrus the developed swat models were imported into the swat cup application for sensitivity calibration and validation analysis in the present study the most commonly used technique sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 algorithm has been used for the analysis the full details of the swat cup can be seen in abbaspour et al 2007 the t stat and p value have been used to identify a set of most sensitive parameters in each catchment the scs curve number was found the most sensitive parameter for all three catchments with the increase of p factor the r factor also increases hence an effort has been made to get p factor more than 70 along with a low r factor for runoff abbaspour 2015 various goodness of fit criteria along with a 95ppu graph of these catchments during calibration and validation have been depicted in table 4 and figs 8 a to 8 c respectively after getting satisfactory performance during calibration and validation the developed swat model for tandula kharkhara and gondli catchments were used to generate runoff series for the near century fp 1 2020 35 mid century fp 2 2046 64 and far century fp 3 2081 99 periods 3 4 module iv present and projected revised capacities of reservoirs to assess revised capacities nine different remote sensing scenes of the liss iii sensor of path 102 and row 58 for satellite irs 1d p6 have been analyzed for the detection of water spread areas at different elevations the fcc and extracted water spread at a level of tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs are presented in fig 9 from the analysis it has been found that tandula reservoir has lost 24 75 mcm of gross storage 8 02 during 93 years from 1922 to 2015 kharkhara lost 8 41 mcm 4 96 during 51 years from 1967 to 2017 and gondli lost 7 21 mcm 7 26 during 60 years from 1956 to 2015 the rates of sediment in tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs have been worked out as 0 032 0 043 and 0 068 mcm 100 sq km year respectively the rate amount of sediment slope type of reservoir and constants c m and n of empirical area reduction techniques for different reservoirs are presented in table 5 the original and revised capacities in three future periods for tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs are presented in figs 10 a to 10 c respectively 3 5 module v water management model for simulation of management plans in module v a management model in the mike hydro basin for the tandula complex was prepared to allocate water for different users in the basin under a set of constraints and priorities the data collected from diverse sources and literature including elevation area capacity table reservoir characteristics levels priorities operation criteria efficiencies and losses groundwater situation were used for setting up the model the designed cropping pattern of tandula kharkhara and gondli commands consist of 82095 ha 6073 ha and 4980 ha kharif paddy respectively where water is supplied from the system the textural retention and hydrological properties of soil play an important role in planning irrigation releases the soils have been grouped into five different classes namely sg 1 to sg 5 tamgadge et al 2002 and kumar et al 2015 and used as inputs in the mike hydro basin model table 6 the mike hydro basin model for the tandula complex system is depicted in fig 11 in the study four separate models have been developed for the base period 1991 2015 and future periods by making necessary changes in the time series and period of simulation a total of 252 simulation runs were made for each future assessment period and described in table 7 the simulation result of the mike hydro basin provided demand supply and deficit at all user nodes along with reservoir levels and storages at a specified time interval daily time scale here the outputs of simulations for the base period and a future scenario are presented in figs 12 a and 12 b from the analysis of simulation results it has been observed that the average demand during the base period may vary from 204 7 to 205 1 mcm for tandula command 18 5 mcm for kharkhara command 17 mcm for gondli command and 40 6 mcm for bsp as three random series for each downscaled gcms were used in the management model the average of demand supply and deficits of three ensembles with identical uncertainty conditions and management strategies were computed that reduced 252 simulation runs to 84 management scenarios with nomenclature as ms 1 to ms 84 these 84 management plans were forwarded to saaty s ahp based decision support system under the rdm framework the graphical representation of demand and deficit of different scenarios along with the base period demand is presented in fig 13 3 6 module vi decision support for evaluation of performance the last module in the framework of robust decision making is the development of decision support to evaluate the recital of the system under different climatic scenarios adaptation options and management measures the simulation results were analyzed to compute different performance indicators pis for all users separately and used in saaty s ahp based decision support for computation relative performance indices rpis of the tandula system 3 6 1 application of saaty s ahp based decision support the performance indicators pis of different users in all 84 management scenarios in each future period have been taken to saaty s ahp decision support for computation of relative performance index rpi 3 6 1 1 computation of weights for indicators the saaty s ahp was constructed with the help of a comparison matrix which ultimately provided weights of different components of decision making with the consistency ratio to adjudge the adequacy of decision among different indicators saaty s ahp decision support conferred a maximum weight of 0 41 for demand deficit while the average demand of any user attained the lowest weight of 0 04 similarly it has been observed that tandula kharkhara and gondli commands and bsp industrial users attained weights as 0 56 0 28 0 12 and 0 04 respectively 3 6 1 2 computation of relative performance index rpi for the development of decision support for the tandula complex the performance of the system has been broken into a three layered hierarchical structure with the goal of relative performance on top four different users including commands of tandula kharkhara gondli and bsp on the second layer and six performance indicators including average demand deficit sustainability reliability vulnerability and resilience on the bottom after the computation of weights of different performance indicators and users from saaty s ahp the relative performance index rpi for 84 different scenarios have been computed for the near century 2020 35 mid century 2046 64 and far century 2081 99 periods under rdm framework the graphical representations of the performance of different scenarios using percentage change of average rainfall in the region with base period rainfall and relative performance indices far near mid and far century periods are presented in figs 14 a to 14 c from the analysis it has been observed that relative performance of the base period varies between 0 63 and 0 65 during the future period when compared with scenarios of those periods and hence 0 65 has been considered as the benchmark performance for the selection of safe and unsafe plans in different periods the percentage change in regional rainfall for a scenario from base period rainfall was computed by taking the seasonal average of all rain gauges in the study area the list of safe and unsafe scenarios during different future assessment periods is presented in tables 8 a to 8 c out of 84 scenarios examined for each period 41 scenarios during fp 1 2020 35 54 scenarios during fp 2 2046 64 and 46 scenarios during fp 3 2081 99 were found below benchmark level need development of additional adaptation measures to cope up plausible climate change condition in the region the suggested adaptive measures are to take proper steps to increase irrigation efficiency by pipe and sprinkler system change cropping pattern considering the available water select paddy crops having low water requirement consider water transfer through interlinking of rivers conjunctive use of surface and groundwater etc 4 summary the present study has been undertaken to develop a dss framework to classify uncertainties and water resources management options using participatory scoping of scenarios analysis for robust decision making further the developed dss framework has been applied on tandula reservoir complex to develop management scenarios plans under rdm framework where there is deep uncertainties of climate change and modelling along with management strategies for water resource project having complex water transfer and non availability of measured data the proposed framework consists of six interconnected modules devised based on the xlrm matrix with the active participation of farmers water resource managers and technocrats in the tandula complex system situated in the chhattisgarh state of india the problem of non availability of runoff data was sorted out with the aid of the water balance model for all three reservoirs tandula kharkhara and gondli reservoirs by computing all the input and output components the projection of future climate in the region confirmed an increase of minimum temperature in the winter months of october to december the maximum temperature will increase in all the months except december with the maximum rise in june during all three future assessment periods the future projection of mean seasonal rainfall from multiple projections of the third generation gcms confirmed reduced rainfall in all rg stations during all three assessment periods except balod where rainfall may increase during the near century period among several models the swat model has been used because of its wide applicability in gauged as well as ungauged catchments the sensitivity analysis suggested that the runoff curve number cn2 is the most sensitive parameter for these catchments it may be concluded from large sets of multiple generated runoff series that the projected average yearly water availability will be reduced in kharkhara and gondli reservoirs in all three future periods the tandula reservoir may receive similar runoff during the mid century period and reduced runoff during the near and far century period the mike hydro basin model for the tandula system was developed and four simulations for the base period bp 1981 2015 and 252 different simulations for each future assessment period were made to deal with all sorts of uncertainties and management options the results of different simulations confirmed that under the uncertainties of modelling and climate change the average yearly water demand of tandula and kharkhara commands will increase in all three future assessment periods the water demand for the gondli command may remain similar in the future the water deficit will also increase in the future when compared with the base period corresponding values for all the users in the system in the decision support for the tandula complex system the tandula command has got the maximum weight among all the users while average yearly demand can be considered the most important performance indicator in the analysis 252 simulation runs were reduced to 84 management scenarios by taking the average of three identical simulations for assessment of relative performance during each future assessment period the relative performance of different management scenarios concluded that more than half of management scenarios out of 84 management scenarios evaluated for each of three future assessment periods may not be able to match the base period performance of the system most of the management scenarios based on low runoff generating parameters failed to meet the demands of users in the system however in the case of best and high predicting runoff scenarios the suggested adaptation strategies of increasing efficiencies and conjunctive use make the system sustainable under the impact of future climate change the mid century period fp 2 will be the most critical period where more than 60 of management scenarios will not be able to perform up to the requisite level the probable reason behind these failures may be the increase in temperature and reduction in the amount and non uniform distribution of rainfall the proposed dss framework enables the development of various scenarios and supports robust decision making under future climatic projections particularly for complex water resources projects 5 conclusions water resource planning development and management have proven problematic owing to the potential implications of short and long term climate change on water supplies socio technical problems and data scarcity a scientific approach withstakeholder participation and the integration of modelling tools for decision making allows for a better knowledge of water resource systems as well as the formulation of future scenarios and management options in the face of climate change the developed dss framework in this research allows for the analysis of management plans with climate uncertainties for complex water resources projects with data scarcity the performance of the developed plans was evaluated using multi criteria decision support in the three layer hierarchal process the developed dss framework provides a solution for strategic water resources planning and management under projected climate scenarios in a basin having problems of scarcity surplus and non uniform distribution of surface water using the participation of farmers technocrats and water resource managers this paper has successfully demonstrated the application of the dss framework for robust decision making in water resources planning and management credit

3936,the amount of groundwater and surface water consumed in a river basin constitutes the blue water footprint bwf to safeguard the environment it has been suggested to set a cap to the bwf based on blue water availability bwa bwa depends on the precipitation that becomes runoff and the need to reserve environmental flow requirements previous studies determined bwf caps based on the use what is there principle which assumes that all bwa in a sub catchment may be consumed locally without the need to reserve water for downstream however bwa in an upstream sub catchment does not have to be consumed locally but could be consumed downstream instead thereby mitigating blue water scarcity in downstream areas therefore this study aims to investigate the effect of alternative allocation principles that account for downstream demands to set monthly bwf caps per sub catchment on bws levels across a large river basin we take the yellow river basin for the period 2010 to 2014 as a case study to evaluate four scenarios of bwf cap setting we compare the natural and reservoir scenario that both apply the use what is there principle to determine the effects of reservoirs on bwf caps we then apply two alternative allocation principles that take relative population size population based scenario and historic blue water demand demand based scenario as a basis to determine bwf caps per sub catchment and compare the effects against the reservoir scenario our results confirm previous findings on the effects of reservoirs on caps we further find that blue water scarcity increases from upstream to downstream under the use what is there principle both the population and demand based scenarios reduce upstream downstream differences in the degree of blue water scarcity the demand based scenario is most effective in this respect on the other hand the population based scenario leads to the smallest upstream downstream differences in bwa per capita the results feed into a discussion on alternative approaches to set bwf caps in a large river basin which needs to take place for bwf caps to become effective and practical concepts in policy making keywords water allocation blue water scarcity blue water footprint sustainability environmental flow requirements 1 introduction freshwater scarcity the competition between different human activities and ecosystems over limited freshwater flows occurs across the globe the ultimate source of freshwater availability is precipitation over land which subsequently feeds rivers recharges groundwater blue water flows recharges soil moisture and evaporates from the vegetated land surface green water flows both green schyns et al 2015 schyns et al 2019 and blue water are scarce but here we focus on the allocation of blue water resources and blue water scarcity as further discussed in section 4 2 severe water scarcity affects many river basins around the world hoekstra et al 2012 and four billion people for at least one month per year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 water scarcity can lead to a lack of freshwater for basic human needs and cause harm to aquatic ecosystems vörösmarty et al 2010 in recent decades human interventions in river systems have helped to mitigate water scarcity to some extent compared to scenarios without interventions but they also caused downstream areas to be more affected by water scarcity compared to upstream areas veldkamp et al 2017 water scarcity is a growing concern since human freshwater consumption has been consistently increasing and projections show that it will continue to grow in the future hejazi et al 2014 wada et al 2014 the extent of the increase in freshwater consumption depends on socio economic aspects such as population growth and consumption patterns a larger global population consumes more freshwater resources and an increase in prosperity lead to a more water intensive consumption pattern hejazi et al 2014 water scarcity may also intensify as a result of climate change which is projected to regionally lead to reduced and more erratic freshwater availability ipcc 2014 wwap 2020 to assure freshwater for basic human needs and aquatic ecosystems the united nations included freshwater supply in one of the sustainable development goals sdgs sdg 6 target 6 4 the target is to ensure sustainable withdrawal and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity un general assembly 2015 united nations 2020 the amount of ground and surface water consumed in a river basin constitutes the blue water footprint bwf of the basin consumption here relates to loss of water from the catchment i e the amount of water that is not returned to the system and should not be confused with water withdrawal that also includes return flows hoekstra 2020 hoekstra et al 2011 this study focusses on the pressure of bwf on riverine systems overutilization of these blue water resources affects ecosystems in and around rivers and human livelihoods that depend on the rivers richter et al 2006 as poff and zimmerman 2010 pointed out there are no general transferrable qualitative relationships between flow alteration and ecological responses however they also supported the statement that the risk of ecological changes increases with flow alterations since a site specific relationship is hard to obtain general principles of environmental flow requirements efr were introduced as a measure for the adverse effects of unsustainable blue water consumption on ecosystems and to assure some kind of environmental protection the efr indicate which part of the natural flow should be reserved for maintaining the river s ecosystem richter et al 2006 the natural flow or natural runoff ro nat is the amount of water that would have become runoff if human activities would not have altered the flow karimi et al 2012 roos 1991 the part of the natural runoff available for consumption is referred to as the blue water availability bwa and defined as the natural runoff minus efr thus the bwa is directly influenced by how efrs are defined to assess whether the environment is affected by blue water consumption the actual bwf can be evaluated using the blue water scarcity ratio bws bws is calculated by dividing the actual bwf by the bwa hoekstra et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 when bws 1 the bwf taps into the efr hoekstra 2014 suggested that sustainable blue water consumption can be assured by actively setting an upper limit of blue water consumption in a river basin a blue water footprint cap bwf cap there is still discussion how to set the bwf cap given the temporal month to month and spatial within a basin variability of bwa and actual bwf while not explicitly referring to cap setting mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 evaluated bws by comparing bwf and bwa globally at a 30 30 arc minute grid they implicitly set a bwf cap equal to bwa which varied per month and per grid cell they determined bwa in a grid cell as the locally generated blue water minus efr plus non consumed blue water from upstream grid cells the latter being calculated as the difference between the blue water generated minus efr and the bwf in those upstream cells this allocation of bwa over the grid cells within a basin can be characterized as a use what is there principle since all bwa in a grid cell is considered available for consumption without the need to reserve water for downstream grid cells in a later study focused on the yellow river basin in china zhuo et al 2019 applied the same principle to calculate monthly bwf caps for three basin compartments upstream midstream and downstream and evaluated the effects of reservoirs on these caps and bws they found that reservoirs raise the bwf cap and reduce bws in the dry season when crop water demands are highest while the filling of reservoirs reduces the bwf cap in the flood season hogeboom et al 2020 estimated bwf caps for over 11 000 basins worldwide by subtracting monthly efr using three alternative methods to determine efr from monthly blue water flows according to five different global hydrological models subsequently for three basins they evaluated the effects of setting fixed meaning not varying over the years monthly bwf caps in terms of over and underutilization of bwa however hogeboom et al 2020 did not compare bwf caps with actual bwfs to analyse effects on bws levels in contrast to the use what is there principle that has been applied in previous studies mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 zhuo et al 2019 bwa in an upstream area of a basin does not necessarily have to be consumed in that specific area but could be consumed somewhere downstream instead blue water can be reserved not consumed in an upstream sub catchment for consumption downstream thereby increasing bwf caps downstream at the expense of lowering bwf caps upstream therefore we postulate that setting bwf caps per sub catchment while accounting for downstream demands can mitigate bws in parts of large river basins yet none of these previous studies has evaluated the effects of setting bwf caps per sub catchment using spatial water allocation principles other than the use what is there principle previous studies have explored alternative principles for the allocation of water among countries in transboundary river basins van der zaag et al 2002 mianabadi et al 2014 mianabadi et al 2015 in the current study we apply some of those alternative allocation principles to the case of monthly bwf cap setting on the level of sub catchments within a river basin concretely this study aims to investigate the effect of alternative principles to set monthly bwf caps per sub catchment on bws levels across a large river basin the yellow river basin yrb is taken as a case study section 2 2 yrb represents an interesting case due to its vast size its importance to the chinese economy and the spatial variability in land and water uses across the basin from densely populated urban areas to sparsely populated agricultural areas and spatial and temporal variability of water supply the period 2010 2014 including a relatively dry year 2010 and a relatively wet year 2013 yrcc 2011 yrcc 2014 is chosen as study period since it represents the inter annual hydrological variability of the yrb and the monthly blue wf data at high spatial resolution are available xie et al 2020 zhuo et al 2016 we investigate two allocation principles use what is there principle and a principle that aims at reserving blue water for downstream consumption in combination with alternative conditions these principles are used to set bwf caps at sub catchment level according to four scenarios i use what is there principle excluding reservoirs ii use what is there principle including the operation of reservoirs iii cap setting based on the spatial distribution of the population at present including reservoirs and iv cap setting based on the spatial distribution of the water demand in recent history including reservoirs compared to the study by zhuo et al 2019 that also focused on the yrb we consider an additional method to calculate efr 2 methods and data 2 1 overview of methods the applied methods and data are summarized in fig 1 each scenario indicated as described in the previous paragraph i to iv monthly bwf caps m3 month per sub catchment are determined from monthly bwa per sub catchment and alternative spatial between sub catchments water allocation scenarios monthly bwa is aggregated from water availability accounts per day at a high spatial resolution and per hydrological response unit in the soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 1998 the swat model used for simulating the hydrological cycle initially was successfully calibrated and validated at a monthly time scale by xie et al 2020 however for the current study we required daily natural runoff results for the inclusion of travel time the travel time through the reach per sub catchment which is in the order of several days is needed to determine when in which month bwa in a particular sub catchment is available in sub catchments further downstream when the cap is transferred from upstream to downstream consequently we require daily natural runoff to determine the monthly bwf caps since it is difficult to obtain natural runoff results for calibration and validation due to the early human influence on the runoff an additional daily validation was performed for two hydrological stations in the upper reach of the yrb located at tangnaihai and lanzhou for the period 2010 2014 this area of the yrb has experienced little less human influence and better resembles natural runoff literature showed that this area is on average accountable for two thirds of the annual generated natural runoff in the yrb gu et al 2019 li et al 2008 zhuo et al 2019 by using this area a large part of the natural runoff is validated the results of this validation are displayed in table 1 daily bwa in a sub catchment is the sum of local bwa and non consumed bwa flowing in from upstream sub catchments mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 whereby we consider the travel time in days through the river channel in each sub catchment the daily bwa is calculated at the outlet of each sub catchment as uniform location for all sub catchments local bwa in each sub catchment is calculated by subtracting the efr from locally generated natural runoff the efr are calculated according to the variable monthly flow method vmf pastor et al 2014 as well as the presumptive standard approach pre richter et al 2012 in that respect we innovate upon the study by zhuo et al 2019 that also focused on the yrb but only applied the pre method the vmf method determines efr based on high intermediate and low flow regimes at which 30 45 and 60 of natural runoff is reserved for the environment the pre method determines efr as a constant percentage of 80 of natural runoff without distinguishing between flow regimes pastor et al 2014 investigated multiple efr estimation methods and compared locally assessed actual environmental blue water needs with the results of multiple methods they showed that the vmf s results were most compatible with actual environmental blue water requirements therefore we focus in the analysis on our vmf based results and compare these with the pre based results in the supplementary information figs s6 to s13 in general terms we define four scenarios to determine monthly bwf caps per sub catchment based on three alternative allocation principles to distribute monthly bwa over the sub catchments and the in exclusion of reservoir operations the natural scenario that applies the use what is there principle but excludes the effects of reservoirs the reservoir scenario that applies the use what is there principle including the operation of reservoirs the population based scenario that applies cap setting based on the spatial distribution of the population for 2010 including reservoirs the demand based scenario that applies cap setting based on the spatial distribution of the water demand in recent history 2000 2009 including reservoirs the reservoir scenario acts as a base case to evaluate the effects of the two alternative cap setting strategies i e allocation principles compared to the use what is there principle the natural scenario is added to show the effects of reservoirs on bwf caps similar to zhuo et al 2019 the population based scenario takes the relative population size per sub catchment as the basis for water allocation which makes sense from the perspective of equity and fair sharing of natural resources the demand based scenario takes the historical water demand as the basis for water allocation which is a realistic option to consider for river basin managers aiming to reduce environmental flow violations by setting bwf caps the implementation of these scenarios is detailed in section 2 3 finally we evaluate monthly bws levels defined as the bwf divided by the bwf cap mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 in all sub catchments by comparing actual bwf estimates with the alternative bwf caps for each month in the period 2010 2014 following hoekstra et al 2012 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 bws is classified into four classes no or low water scarcity bwf does not exceed the bwf cap 0 bws 1 moderate water scarcity 1 bws 1 5 significant water scarcity 1 5 bws 2 and severe water scarcity bws 2 data sources are described in section 2 4 2 2 study area the yrb is the second largest river basin in china with a drainage area of 7 53 105 km2 the main river channel s length is 5464 km wu et al 2018 the basin is located in the northern part of china and its elevation ranges from 1 to 6199 m jiang et al 2016 the basin is commonly divided into three reaches upper middle and lower reach yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 zhuo et al 2019 in the current study the yrb is divided into 31 sub catchments that are automatically delineated by swat based on the evaluation distribution fig 2 gives an overview and a schematization of the yrb because of the monsoon climate the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation is heterogeneous most precipitation occurs in the period between june and september and increases from northwest to southeast tang et al 2008 the average annual natural runoff is 58 109 m3 year or 77 mm year hua and cui 2018 the importance of the yellow river can be illustrated by the 107 million people that are directly supported by the river liu et al 2008 the yrb plays a vital role in china s agricultural production the cultivated area in the basin is 129 103 km2 13 of china s total however it only holds 2 of the country s freshwater resources the combination of the agricultural bwf and the bwf of household and industry have led to moderate and severe water scarcity during several months per year hoekstra et al 2012 zhuo et al 2016 zhuo et al 2019 the current study considers the bwf cap in the situation with and without reservoirs the five major mainstream reservoirs included are longyangxia liujiaxia wanjiazhai sanmenxia and xiaolangdi locations in fig 2 are adopted from zhuo et al 2019 by the end of 2014 the total storage capacity of all reservoirs in the yrb was around 1 2 times the average annual natural runoff or 72 109 m3 year ran and lu 2012 the total storage capacity of the five reservoirs is 78 of the basin s total storage capacity 2 3 determination of bwf caps according to four alternative scenarios 2 3 1 natural scenario the natural scenario considers the current natural circumstances in the basin which is to be understood as the situation with current land use and no reservoirs for the land use map applied see fig s1 and applies the use what is there allocation principle this principle states that a sub catchment s bwf cap is equal to the total bwa in the sub catchment the bwf cap calculation for sub catchment x at time t is displayed in eq 1 the local component bwa local is the result of locally generated blue water minus efr in sub catchment x the upstream component bwa up is the amount of blue water that enters the sub catchment from an upstream sub catchment that remains after consumption in the upstream sub catchment 1 bwf cap x t bwa local x t bwa up x t the upstream component is calculated according to eq 2 the amount of water that enters sub catchment x is estimated by subtracting the upstream actual bwf from the corresponding bwf cap the travel time through the river section of sub catchment x t x is included in this component the blue water from the upstream sub catchment at t t x corresponds with the bwf cap in sub catchment x at time t since it travels through the channel in x before it reaches its outlet where the bwa for x is estimated 2 bwa up x t max bwf cap x 1 t t x bwf x 1 t t x 0 2 3 2 reservoir scenario the reservoir scenario is similar to the natural scenario and applies the use what is there allocation principle and considers current land use the addition for this scenario is the operation of the five major reservoirs in the main river the effect of the operation of the reservoirs on the bwf cap is influenced by the location of the reservoirs in a sub catchment the outlets of sub catchments that contain a reservoir are pinpointed as the actual location of the reservoirs therefore the reservoirs are implemented at the outlet of a sub catchment the operation of a reservoir can directly affect two sub catchments the sub catchment it is located in and the sub catchment directly downstream blue water retention in a reservoir directly reduces the bwf cap in the sub catchment it is located in because blue water that is being retained is not available for consumption the blue water retention indirectly reduces the bwf cap in downstream sub catchments in the month it is retained as well since less water flows downstream during that month release of blue water from a reservoir does not affect the bwf cap of the sub catchment it is located in because it is at the outlet of the sub catchment thereby assuming the reservoir supplies water to users downstream only however reservoir releases directly increase the bwf cap in the downstream sub catchment and indirectly in the sub catchments further downstream the effect of the reservoirs on the bwf cap in sub catchment x on day t is summarized in eqs 3 6 the operation of reservoirs is based on observed stored water volume changes in the reservoirs these changes are daily implemented by dividing the monthly changes uniformly over the days of the month if δ s x t 0 3 bwf cap x t m a x bwa local x t bwa up x t δ s x t 0 4 bwf cap x 1 t bwa local x 1 t bwa up x t if δ s x t 0 5 bwf cap x t bwa local x t bwa up x t 6 bwf cap x 1 t bwa local x 1 t bwa up x t δ s x t t x 1 where δ s is the storage change adjusted for the effect of net precipitation on the reservoir s surface area note a positive storage change indicates blue water retention and a negative storage change indicates blue water release the sub catchment containing the reservoir is denoted with x and the one directly downstream with x 1 the timing of the blue water release in sub catchment x for the bwf cap in sub catchment x 1 at time t corresponds with t t x 1 where t x 1 is the travel time through the river section in sub catchment x 1 the bwf cap cannot be negative hence the maximization function 2 3 3 population based scenario an allocation based on the use what is there principle favours upstream sub catchments since the bwf cap is based on the total bwa without considering other sub catchments however the largest part of the population in the yrb lives in the downstream area of the basin redcp 2010 see fig s2 the spatial division of blue water over the basin in previous scenarios leads to an unequal distribution of blue water over the population van der zaag et al 2002 proposed a method to divide blue water resources equally over the population of riparian countries in a transboundary river basin that method can be translated to the sub catchment configuration of the yrb the interdependency between sub catchments is expressed as the responsibility of a sub catchment to supply blue water to sub catchments downstream the amount of water a sub catchment is entitled to or entitled blue water availability ebwa depends on the amount of blue water sustainably available from sub catchment x to the most downstream sub catchment n and the relative population size of x compared to the total population from x to n these components are summarized in eq 7 bwa down represents the bwa in sub catchment x and all sub catchments downstream of x from x to n illustrated by eq 8 7 ebwa x bwa up x bwa down x p x i x n p i 8 bwa down x i x n bwa local i the index of summation i denotes which sub catchments are considered for either the relative population size or bwa down in both cases the sub catchments considered are sub catchment x and all sub catchments downstream of x from x to n the method by van der zaag et al 2002 is intended for the allocation of blue water on an annual scale and between riparian countries along the mainstream of a river we apply two adjustments to their method to allocate bwa on a monthly scale and between sub catchments a third adjustment is needed to properly account for the effect of reservoirs the first adjustment is to include the travel time of water through the river allocating water from upstream to downstream sub catchments implies that upstream sub catchments reserve water intended for downstream areas when reserving water in sub catchment x in timestep t we should take into account the time it takes for the water to arrive in downstream sub catchment i hence when determining a sub catchment s ebwa bwa down refers to water that is in the downstream sub catchments at later time steps the bwa in downstream sub catchment i is considered in the ebwa calculation for sub catchment x at the same moment the water from x will arrive at i local bwa in downstream sub catchment i is considered in the ebwa calculation for sub catchment x at t t i x time t plus the travel time from the outlet of x to the outlet of i this calculation is done for every sub catchment downstream of x until the most downstream sub catchment n and the contributions are then summed to obtain bwa down for sub catchment x the second adjustment follows from the schematized delineation of sub catchments in fig 2 the schematization indicates the presence of tributary sub catchments bwa entering the mainstream from these sub catchments adds to the estimation of bwa down for sub catchment x blue water that enters the mainstream depends on the bwf cap and the actual bwf in the tributary sub catchment since this blue water influences bwa down for mainstream sub catchments the bwf cap of tributary sub catchments must be calculated before bwf caps of sub catchments along the mainstream can be calculated a tributary sub catchment is considered as the most upstream sub catchment of its river system for the calculation of the bwf cap this river system consists of the tributary sub catchment the first sub catchment in the mainstream and all downstream mainstream sub catchments bwa down of an upstream tributary sub catchment thus depends on bwa from downstream tributary sub catchments that enter the mainstream therefore the bwf cap of tributary sub catchments is calculated in downstream to upstream order the third adjustment is the inclusion of reservoirs the inclusion of reservoirs has a two sided effect on the calculation of sub catchments x s bwf cap see section 2 3 2 it influences bwa up by retention or release in an upstream reservoir and it influences bwa down by retention or release in a downstream reservoir the influence in bwa up is straightforward either a decrease or an increase due to retention or release however the influence on bwa down is more complex bwa down is not merely the sum of local bwa from the sub catchments and storage changes of reservoirs this would imply that local bwa in a downstream sub catchment can be considered for retention in an upstream reservoir which is incorrect because water only flows downstream we have assumed that local bwa in a sub catchment affects the retention of the first reservoir downstream section 2 3 2 therefore we calculate bwa down for six different sections j of the mainstream determined by looking at the location of the five reservoirs fig 2 the bwa of every section is calculated to determine bwa down of sub catchment x the first step in calculating the bwa of section j is to determine the location of section j with respect to the location of sub catchment x there are three possibilities section j is upstream of x x is within section j or section j is downstream of x these options and their effect are displayed in fig 3 in the schematization m represents the most downstream sub catchment in section j and h the most upstream sub catchment in section j the first option results in a bwa in section j to zero the second option can be translated to eq 9 where bwa is the sum of the local bwa from x to the most downstream in the section sub catchment m plus blue water entering from the tributary sub catchments in the section and minus the possible retention positive storage change of the reservoir in m 9 b w a d o w n x t j max i x m b w a l o c a l i t t i x b w a t r i b u t a r y i t t i x max s j t t m x 0 0 the third option can be translated to eq 10 where the bwa is the sum of the local bwa from the most upstream sub catchment h to the most downstream sub catchment m plus blue water entering from tributary sub catchments in section j minus possible retention positive storage change and minus possible release negative storage change of the reservoir in h 10 bwa down x t j max i h m bwa local i t t i x bwa tributary i t t i x max δ s j t t m x 0 m i n δ s j 1 t t h x 0 0 the total bwa down is the sum of the bwa in all six sections where the bwa in each section is estimated by one of the three possibilities the final adjustment is to convert the ebwa of a sub catchment to an actual bwf cap this adjustment is to check ebwa with the actual bwa present in sub catchment x at day t bwa x t this ensures that no more blue water is allocated than present in the sub catchment resulting in eq 11 for the population based bwf cap 11 bwf cap x t min bwa up x t bwa down x t p x i x n p i bwa x t the sum of the calculated bwa up and bwa down is multiplied with a population based allocation factor similar to the factor in eq 7 2 3 4 demand based scenario the demand based allocation scenario aims to allocate water to the sub catchments with the largest blue water consumption which are not necessarily the most populated sub catchments the largest blue water consumer in the yrb is agriculture and it is considerably larger than the consumption of household and industry see fig s3 the land use map in fig s1 shows that agricultural areas are not necessarily near the most densely populated sub catchments the demand based allocation factor is determined using a multi year average of the bwf of a sub catchment in recent history the bwf data used for this multi year average is from a 10 year period from 2000 to 2009 the monthly multi year averages are used to determine a monthly demand based allocation factor per sub catchment eq 12 shows the calculation of the bwf cap according to the demand based scenario 12 bwf cap x t min bwa down x t bwa up x t bwf 2000 2009 x m i x n bwf 2000 2009 i m bwa x t where bwf 2000 2009 m x is the average bwf of sub catchment x in month m over the period 2000 2009 this is divided by the summation of monthly average bwf from 2000 to 2009 from sub catchment x to most downstream sub catchment n the other components are the same as the components in eq 11 2 4 data the swat model requires a digital elevation model dem land use map soil class map and meteorological data for the simulation of natural runoff in the yrb the dem was obtained from the national elevation dataset from the united states geological survey usgs at 15 sec grid level usgs 2019 the land use data was taken from the resource and environment data cloud platform at 1x1 km resolution redcp 2015 the soil class map was obtained from the harmonized world soil database at a scale of 1 1 000 000 hwsd 2009 the daily meteorological data precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity required to simulate the hydrological cycle in swat were obtained from the chinese national meteorological information centre cnmic 2019 the monthly reservoir storage changes were collected from the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc 2015 data on the population per square km were retrieved from the resource and environment data cloud platform redcp 2010 the bwf data of household and industry in the yrb from 2000 to 2014 were available at subarea level between two hydrological station in the basin from the yrcc yrcc 2015 dividing the total basin in seven areas see fig s4 finally the bwf data of agriculture from 2000 to 2014 at 5 arc minute resolution were obtained from wang et al 2019 3 results 3 1 natural runoff the natural runoff represents the hydrology of the yrb under the current land use conditions without human water abstractions and acts as a reference in evaluating the effects of bwf caps on spatiotemporal blue water allocation the annual average 2010 2014 simulated natural runoff in the yrb is 64 1010 m3 year the monthly average natural runoff with each sub catchment s contribution is depicted in fig 4 the upper reach provides a large part of the natural runoff during the dry months december to may of the year during the wet months june to october of the year the other parts of the basin have a proportionally larger contribution to the natural runoff 3 2 monthly bwf caps under alternative bwf cap scenarios the effect of alternative water allocation scenarios within the yrb on the monthly bwf caps determined using the vmf method to estimate efr are visualized in fig 5 for four characteristic sub catchments see fig 2 for their location sub catchment 17 fig 5a characterizes an upstream sub catchment with a small population size and low blue water demand both relative to the other sub catchments and contains a reservoir sub catchment 2 fig 5b characterizes a sub catchment in the middle stream with a medium population size and high blue water demand sub catchment 23 fig 5c characterizes a tributary sub catchment with a medium population size and medium blue water demand sub catchment 18 fig 5d characterizes the most downstream sub catchment with a large population size and high blue water demand as indicated in section 2 we focus our analysis on the vmf based results and elaborate upon differences with the pre method in the discussion section 4 in the natural scenario the bwf caps follow the pattern of natural runoff but are lower because the caps account for efr the bwf caps decrease from upstream to downstream this is expected since this scenario applies the use what is there principle meaning that upstream sub catchments can use bwa without reserving parts of it for downstream sub catchments consequently during dry periods of the year the downstream bwf caps approach zero in the reservoir scenario the operation of the reservoirs alters the timing of bwa also in this scenario because of the use what is there principle we observe that the bwf caps decrease from upstream to downstream the effects of reservoirs on the bwf caps depend on the location of sub catchments with respect to the reservoirs the upstream sub catchment 17 fig 5a retains water in a reservoir but does not benefit from releases from upstream reservoirs since there are none present therefore the bwf cap in the reservoir scenario and the other scenarios that contain reservoirs operations is always below the cap in the natural scenario for this sub catchment the operation of reservoirs has no effect on the bwf cap of tributary sub catchments fig 5c because we only considered five reservoirs in the mainstream for middle stream and downstream reservoirs we confirm the findings of zhuo et al 2019 that reservoirs increase the bwf cap in the dry season because of reservoir releases and decrease the cap in the wet season because of reservoir retention in the population and demand based scenarios bwf caps are moved from upstream to downstream sub catchments compared to the other scenarios which are based on the use what is there principle water is reserved not consumed in upstream sub catchments for the benefit of downstream sub catchments sub catchment 17 fig 5a has both a small population size and a low historical blue water demand and must therefore reserve bwa for downstream sub catchments in both the population and demand based bwf cap scenarios the result is exceptionally low bwf caps in this sub catchment compared to the natural and reservoir scenarios sub catchment 2 fig 5b has a medium population size but a high historical blue water demand and is therefore allocated more blue water i e has a higher bwf cap in the demand based than in the population based scenario the downstream sub catchment 18 fig 5d with both a large population size and high historical blue water demand clearly benefits from the population and demand based scenarios in terms of increasing bwf caps particularly in the dry season when blue water demands peak where in the natural and reservoir scenarios the bwf caps are close to zero the tributary sub catchment fig 5c has a medium population size and historical blue water demand leading to similar bwf caps the decrease in bwf caps for the population and demand based scenarios compared to the natural and reservoir scenarios show that tributary sub catchments also reserve bwa for downstream sub catchments in sub catchments 2 and 18 fig 5b and d which both have a relatively high historical blue water demand compared to other sub catchments one can see that the bwf caps in the demand based scenario have as expected the best match with actual blue water demand bwf this does not mean that the actual bwf is always below bwa see fig 5b in particular in the demand based scenario because bwa is constrained by natural runoff minus efr furthermore there is some minor difference between the historical bwf 2000 2009 that was used to determine the height of the caps and the bwf in the more recent period of 2010 2014 that was used to evaluate the caps with respect to blue water demand see fig s5 3 3 water scarcity levels across the yrb under alternative bwf cap scenarios as illustrated for four sub catchments in fig 5 monthly exceedance of the bwf cap varies among the scenarios and exceedance of the bwf cap occurs in all scenarios during parts of the year generally bws is most pronounced in summer months due to the mismatch between bwa which is low and the actual bwf which rises due to crop s irrigation needs the effect of alternative bwf cap scenarios on the spatial distribution of the water scarcity in the summer months is displayed in fig 6 bws is calculated per month fig 6 depicts the average bws ratio during the summer months june to august in 2010 2014 similar figures for the other seasons spring autumn and winter are shown in figs s6 s8 respectively the effect of the use what is there principle is visible in fig 6a and b bws increases from upstream to downstream since upstream sub catchments can use bwa without having to reserve not consume parts of it for downstream sub catchments comparing fig 6a and b one can see that reservoirs reduce bws particularly in sub catchments downstream of the first and second reservoir up to the reservoir in the northeast of the yrb the two most downstream reservoirs cause a local reduction of bws in the sub catchments just downstream the reason for bws reduction in the entire area between the second and the third reservoir instead of just local reduction like for the two most downstream reservoirs is the size and corresponding release of the two most upstream reservoirs these two reservoirs account for approximately 60 of the total storage capacity of the five reservoirs as a result the reservoirs can release large amounts of water in combination with a smaller upstream bwf the released water travels further downstream than for the other reservoirs causing bws to decrease reservoirs release water in summer which causes severe bws to occur further downstream compared to the natural scenario compared to the natural and reservoir scenario fig 6a and b which are based on the use what is there principle we see that when water is reserved for downstream uses in the population and demand based scenarios fig 6c and d the bws levels in the upstream part of the yrb increase while bws levels decrease in the lower reach and some sub catchments in the middle reach this means that regional differences in the degree of bws between upstream and downstream reduce fig 6 shows bws according to the common classification scheme and consequently does not show changes in bws within classes particularly in the class bws 5 therefore the bws ratio per reach per cap setting scenario for each of the four seasons and as an annual average are shown in table 2 in the upper reach bws increases from the reservoir scenario to the population and demand based scenarios since water is reserved for downstream sub catchments consequently bws reduces in the middle and lower reaches this effect is somewhat stronger in the demand based than the population based scenario especially in the middle reach differences in bws between the upper middle and lower reaches are smallest for the demand based scenario despite the partial mitigation of bws in parts of the river basin as a result of alternative bwf cap setting bws 1 in spring and summer and bws 1 during these seasons in the middle reach this means that in these cases environmental flow violations occur the mismatch between blue water availability and demand in the yrb during the spring and summer is too large to mitigate blue water scarcity by the alternative bwf cap setting scenarios alone when the actual bwf exceeds the cap indicating environmental flow violation this effect propagates downstream the bwf cap in a sub catchment partly depends on the bwa coming from the sub catchment directly upstream whenever an upstream sub catchment consumes the entire cap bws 1 the subsequent sub catchment does not receive the upstream part of non consumed bwa this effect is strongest for the sub catchments just before the reservoirs and the end of the middle reach sanmenxia and xiaolangdi see fig 2 and are furthest away from the reservoir at the start of the middle reach wanjiazhai see fig 2 the population based allocation principle aims for equal water sharing amongst the population within the river basin to evaluate the effectiveness of the cap setting in this respect table 3 shows the water availability per capita for the three reaches in the yrb per cap setting scenario the population based allocation indeed leads to the most equal distribution of blue water availability per capita over the three reaches the reservoir scenario which is based on the use what is there principle translates to the largest upstream downstream differences in blue water availability per capita the demand based scenario also leads to smaller upstream downstream differences in blue water availability per capita compared to the reservoir scenario the numbers in table 3 can be contextualized with the blue water crowding index of falkenmark et al 1989 according to this indicator areas are said to experience water stress with blue water availability of 1000 1700 m3 capita year water scarcity with 500 1000 m3 capita year and absolute water scarcity with 500 m3 capita year rijsberman 2006 when comparing changes in this indicator from the reservoir scenario to the population and demand based scenarios the upper reach moves from no water stress to water stress the middle reach remains classified as water stressed although per capita water availability increases in the population and demand based scenarios and the lower reach moves from water scarcity to water stress 4 discussion we have postulated that setting bwf caps per sub catchment while accounting for downstream demands can mitigate bws in parts of large river basins we assessed this for the case of the yrb and found indeed that severe bws in parts of the yrb can be mitigated by setting bwf caps per sub catchment based on relative with respect to other sub catchments population size or historical blue water demand since these two allocation principles in contrast to the use what is there principle account for downstream water demands bws levels downstream reduce while they increase in upstream sub catchments such that upstream downstream differences in the severity of bws reduce 4 1 allocation scenarios and implementation one can argue that accounting for downstream uses resulting in a reduction of upstream downstream differences in the severity of bws is more equitable than the use what is there principle because it implies that the burden of bws in terms of environmental damages or benefits foregone as result of water limitations is more equally spread between upstream and downstream areas in the basin the demand based scenario is somewhat more effective in this respect that the population based scenario on the other hand the population based scenario achieves the smallest differences in blue water availability per capita across the upper middle and lower reaches both allocation scenarios thus generate in different ways a more equitable water allocation in the yrb than the use what is there principle in that sense both scenarios have potential for policy implementation the implementation of bwf caps in policy is not common and several challenges need to be tackled for bwf caps to become effective and practical concepts in policy making as discussed by hogeboom et al 2020 and grafton et al 2014 the alternative principles to determine bwf caps and their effects on blue water scarcity and per capita water availability as evaluated in this study can feed such discussions towards implementation of bwf caps on this note we would like to make two remarks regarding the demand based scenario first the allocation scenario is only effective when the spatiotemporal pattern of the current demand matches that of the historical demand second this scenario entitles more water to a sub catchment with a large historical water demand as such it dis incentivizes measures to reduce water demand therefore it could be more appropriate to use an estimated reasonable water demand for a sub catchment as a basis for bwf cap setting at the sub catchment level that reasonable amount could be estimated as the total water demand in the case that all activities in the sub catchment would reduce their process bwf to certain benchmark levels set by the best available practices or achieved by the most efficient water users in the sub catchment hoekstra 2020 4 2 assumptions and limitations this study has a few assumptions and limitations that deserve further clarification first our results depend on the chosen method to determine efr and hence bwa there are no governmental regulations of efr for the yrb thus we chose to use efr estimation methods to determine the efrs in the basin zhuo et al 2019 to investigate how bws depends on the chosen efrs we used two efr estimation methods we have decided to present the results based on the variable monthly flow method vmf to estimate efr instead of the presumptive standard approach pre see section 2 vmf distinguished between flow regimes and between 30 and 60 of natural runoff is reserved for the environment where 30 corresponds with a high flow regime and 60 with a low flow regime pre does not consider flow regime and constantly reserves 80 for the environment the effect of the two methods to estimate efr is expressed as the difference in bwf caps and bws generally the bwf caps are larger for vmf than for pre where the difference is largest for the high flow regime due to the largest difference between the vmf and pre percentage to determine efr the effect on bwf caps applying pre to estimate efr is displayed in fig s9 the bws differences are in line with differences in bwf caps the spatial pattern of bws for pre correspond with the pattern for vmf but the bws values are more severe the maps based on pre for the four scenarios are displayed in figs s10 s13 respectively a second limitation of the study is that we only included five mainstream reservoirs because we did not have data on reservoir changes for other reservoirs as a consequence we probably overestimate bws in sub catchments downstream of reservoirs that were not included in this study this applies for both mainstream and tributary sub catchments for sub catchments in the mainstream we expect this error to be small since the reservoirs we included account for 78 of the total storage capacity in the yrb ran and lu 2012 and all mainstream sub catchments downstream of the included reservoirs benefit from their effect on bwa for tributary sub catchments that have reservoirs in place this could have led to a significant overestimation of bws we indeed observe high bws values in tributary sub catchments the reservoirs in the tributary rivers account for only 6 of the storage capacity based on the location of reservoirs from ran and lu 2012 within tributary sub catchments defined in this study however in a tributary sub catchment with little blue water demand a small reservoir could already alleviate bws significantly by excluding them in the current study the bws in tributary sub catchments probably is overestimated a third limitation of the study is the configuration of tributary sub catchments in the population and demand based scenarios currently these tributary sub catchments are considered as the most upstream sub catchment in their river system and are responsible for blue water in downstream sub catchments however they are fully dependent on the local bwa as opposed to mainstream sub catchments the responsibility to supply water to downstream mainstream sub catchments causes bws to increase in the scenarios that do not consider other sub catchments in blue water allocation compared to the two scenarios that do while tributary sub catchments often already experience severe bws in the natural and reservoir scenarios bws increases in de population and demand based scenarios this occurs in seasons when mainstream sub catchments do not necessarily require bwa from tributary sub catchments this is caused by the fact that population and demand based allocation principles consider other sub catchments in determining the right to blue water ebwa and not necessarily the need of blue water of the mainstream sub catchments this could be prevented by applying the use what is there principle locally for tributary sub catchments however this is not a general solution since the relation between tributary and mainstream sub catchments might be different in other basins another solution could be to include a component that accounts for the actual bwf of a downstream sub catchment or the effect on bws of a certain blue water distribution this component could be used to allocate blue water to the sub catchment that benefits most a fourth assumption that needs to be pointed out is that the operation of the five major reservoirs is taken as the observed stored water volume changes for the reservoir population and demand based scenarios these three scenarios consider the same amounts of water being released or retained by the reservoirs as input for the cap setting our model did not allow for the optimization of reservoir operations to possibly achieve a more desirable water allocation according to relative population size of historical water demand however such an optimization would be rather hypothetical anyway since reservoir operations are in practice tuned to fulfil a range of purposes next to water supply including hydroelectricity generation and flood control zhuo et al 2019 a final note of attention is that in this study in contrast to some of the allocation scenarios in van der zaag et al 2002 we do not explicitly account for the availability of green water the precipitation water in the unsaturated zone of the soil that can be made productive in agriculture and forestry in the allocation of blue water resources in the demand based scenario we do implicitly account for green water because the historical blue water demand of agriculture has been estimated with a crop growth model that accounts for green water when estimating blue water needs wang et al 2019 although we endorse the relevance of green water in the economy schyns et al 2015 schyns et al 2019 we had a couple of reasons not to explicitly incorporate green water in our blue water allocation scenarios the argument to consider green water in blue water allocation is that a sub catchment rich in green water can use that water to grow crops and timber and to sustain grazing systems and therefore is less in need of additional blue water however the technical implementation of this idea in a method for bwf cap setting is problematic first the question arises how to value green versus blue water since green and blue water cannot be made productive in the same way and for the same uses for example blue water can be taken from rivers and groundwater bodies and used in irrigated agriculture industries and households elsewhere green water is land bound and can only be made productive in the economy for biomass growth in agriculture or forestry this is the reason why green water use generally has lower opportunity costs than blue water use aldaya et al 2010 this is also reflected in the assessment by van der zaag et al 2002 who assume that green water has half the value compared to blue water and acknowledge that this is an important variable to reach consensus between riparian countries in the context of transboundary water sharing second it is not straightforward to determine green water availability for each sub catchment since green water availability not only depends on the size of the green water flows which follows from a hydrological model like swat that we used but also on where these flows can actually be made productive in agriculture and forestry schyns et al 2019 part of the green water flows will occur in areas unsuitable for agriculture or forestry because of biophysical constraints e g too steep slopes too extreme temperatures or infertile soils or because they need to be preserved for terrestrial ecosystems similarly to efr which are subtracted from natural blue water runoff future research may tackle these challenges and focus on how to best account for green water in blue water allocation and bwf cap setting 5 conclusion we have investigated alternative allocation scenarios to determine monthly bwf caps per sub catchment of the yrb and evaluated the effects on bws levels experienced across the yrb this study confirms a number of findings of previous studies on bws in the yrb i bws is most severe in spring and summer zhuo et al 2016 ii reservoir releases in the dry season reduce bws levels in these months while bws levels increase in the wet months when water is needed to fill the reservoirs zhuo et al 2019 iii bws increases from upstream to downstream when the use what is there principle of water allocation is applied zhuo et al 2019 we have shown that this third point is no longer true when a different water allocation principle is applied that considers downstream sub catchments in bwf cap setting by means of relative population sizes or relative historical demand in those cases regional differences between upstream and downstream bwf caps and bws reduce the demand based scenario results in the smallest upstream downstream differences in bws the population based scenario also reduces upstream downstream differences in bws compared to the use what is there principle and results in the smallest upstream downstream differences in water availability per capita we thus conclude that setting bwf caps per sub catchment can mitigate water scarcity in parts of a large river basin it remains to be investigated what are the most appropriate combinations of allocation principles and how these can be translated to river basin policy and management credit authorship contribution statement luc t albers conceptualization methodology validation visualization formal analysis investigation writing

3936,the amount of groundwater and surface water consumed in a river basin constitutes the blue water footprint bwf to safeguard the environment it has been suggested to set a cap to the bwf based on blue water availability bwa bwa depends on the precipitation that becomes runoff and the need to reserve environmental flow requirements previous studies determined bwf caps based on the use what is there principle which assumes that all bwa in a sub catchment may be consumed locally without the need to reserve water for downstream however bwa in an upstream sub catchment does not have to be consumed locally but could be consumed downstream instead thereby mitigating blue water scarcity in downstream areas therefore this study aims to investigate the effect of alternative allocation principles that account for downstream demands to set monthly bwf caps per sub catchment on bws levels across a large river basin we take the yellow river basin for the period 2010 to 2014 as a case study to evaluate four scenarios of bwf cap setting we compare the natural and reservoir scenario that both apply the use what is there principle to determine the effects of reservoirs on bwf caps we then apply two alternative allocation principles that take relative population size population based scenario and historic blue water demand demand based scenario as a basis to determine bwf caps per sub catchment and compare the effects against the reservoir scenario our results confirm previous findings on the effects of reservoirs on caps we further find that blue water scarcity increases from upstream to downstream under the use what is there principle both the population and demand based scenarios reduce upstream downstream differences in the degree of blue water scarcity the demand based scenario is most effective in this respect on the other hand the population based scenario leads to the smallest upstream downstream differences in bwa per capita the results feed into a discussion on alternative approaches to set bwf caps in a large river basin which needs to take place for bwf caps to become effective and practical concepts in policy making keywords water allocation blue water scarcity blue water footprint sustainability environmental flow requirements 1 introduction freshwater scarcity the competition between different human activities and ecosystems over limited freshwater flows occurs across the globe the ultimate source of freshwater availability is precipitation over land which subsequently feeds rivers recharges groundwater blue water flows recharges soil moisture and evaporates from the vegetated land surface green water flows both green schyns et al 2015 schyns et al 2019 and blue water are scarce but here we focus on the allocation of blue water resources and blue water scarcity as further discussed in section 4 2 severe water scarcity affects many river basins around the world hoekstra et al 2012 and four billion people for at least one month per year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 water scarcity can lead to a lack of freshwater for basic human needs and cause harm to aquatic ecosystems vörösmarty et al 2010 in recent decades human interventions in river systems have helped to mitigate water scarcity to some extent compared to scenarios without interventions but they also caused downstream areas to be more affected by water scarcity compared to upstream areas veldkamp et al 2017 water scarcity is a growing concern since human freshwater consumption has been consistently increasing and projections show that it will continue to grow in the future hejazi et al 2014 wada et al 2014 the extent of the increase in freshwater consumption depends on socio economic aspects such as population growth and consumption patterns a larger global population consumes more freshwater resources and an increase in prosperity lead to a more water intensive consumption pattern hejazi et al 2014 water scarcity may also intensify as a result of climate change which is projected to regionally lead to reduced and more erratic freshwater availability ipcc 2014 wwap 2020 to assure freshwater for basic human needs and aquatic ecosystems the united nations included freshwater supply in one of the sustainable development goals sdgs sdg 6 target 6 4 the target is to ensure sustainable withdrawal and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity un general assembly 2015 united nations 2020 the amount of ground and surface water consumed in a river basin constitutes the blue water footprint bwf of the basin consumption here relates to loss of water from the catchment i e the amount of water that is not returned to the system and should not be confused with water withdrawal that also includes return flows hoekstra 2020 hoekstra et al 2011 this study focusses on the pressure of bwf on riverine systems overutilization of these blue water resources affects ecosystems in and around rivers and human livelihoods that depend on the rivers richter et al 2006 as poff and zimmerman 2010 pointed out there are no general transferrable qualitative relationships between flow alteration and ecological responses however they also supported the statement that the risk of ecological changes increases with flow alterations since a site specific relationship is hard to obtain general principles of environmental flow requirements efr were introduced as a measure for the adverse effects of unsustainable blue water consumption on ecosystems and to assure some kind of environmental protection the efr indicate which part of the natural flow should be reserved for maintaining the river s ecosystem richter et al 2006 the natural flow or natural runoff ro nat is the amount of water that would have become runoff if human activities would not have altered the flow karimi et al 2012 roos 1991 the part of the natural runoff available for consumption is referred to as the blue water availability bwa and defined as the natural runoff minus efr thus the bwa is directly influenced by how efrs are defined to assess whether the environment is affected by blue water consumption the actual bwf can be evaluated using the blue water scarcity ratio bws bws is calculated by dividing the actual bwf by the bwa hoekstra et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 when bws 1 the bwf taps into the efr hoekstra 2014 suggested that sustainable blue water consumption can be assured by actively setting an upper limit of blue water consumption in a river basin a blue water footprint cap bwf cap there is still discussion how to set the bwf cap given the temporal month to month and spatial within a basin variability of bwa and actual bwf while not explicitly referring to cap setting mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 evaluated bws by comparing bwf and bwa globally at a 30 30 arc minute grid they implicitly set a bwf cap equal to bwa which varied per month and per grid cell they determined bwa in a grid cell as the locally generated blue water minus efr plus non consumed blue water from upstream grid cells the latter being calculated as the difference between the blue water generated minus efr and the bwf in those upstream cells this allocation of bwa over the grid cells within a basin can be characterized as a use what is there principle since all bwa in a grid cell is considered available for consumption without the need to reserve water for downstream grid cells in a later study focused on the yellow river basin in china zhuo et al 2019 applied the same principle to calculate monthly bwf caps for three basin compartments upstream midstream and downstream and evaluated the effects of reservoirs on these caps and bws they found that reservoirs raise the bwf cap and reduce bws in the dry season when crop water demands are highest while the filling of reservoirs reduces the bwf cap in the flood season hogeboom et al 2020 estimated bwf caps for over 11 000 basins worldwide by subtracting monthly efr using three alternative methods to determine efr from monthly blue water flows according to five different global hydrological models subsequently for three basins they evaluated the effects of setting fixed meaning not varying over the years monthly bwf caps in terms of over and underutilization of bwa however hogeboom et al 2020 did not compare bwf caps with actual bwfs to analyse effects on bws levels in contrast to the use what is there principle that has been applied in previous studies mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 zhuo et al 2019 bwa in an upstream area of a basin does not necessarily have to be consumed in that specific area but could be consumed somewhere downstream instead blue water can be reserved not consumed in an upstream sub catchment for consumption downstream thereby increasing bwf caps downstream at the expense of lowering bwf caps upstream therefore we postulate that setting bwf caps per sub catchment while accounting for downstream demands can mitigate bws in parts of large river basins yet none of these previous studies has evaluated the effects of setting bwf caps per sub catchment using spatial water allocation principles other than the use what is there principle previous studies have explored alternative principles for the allocation of water among countries in transboundary river basins van der zaag et al 2002 mianabadi et al 2014 mianabadi et al 2015 in the current study we apply some of those alternative allocation principles to the case of monthly bwf cap setting on the level of sub catchments within a river basin concretely this study aims to investigate the effect of alternative principles to set monthly bwf caps per sub catchment on bws levels across a large river basin the yellow river basin yrb is taken as a case study section 2 2 yrb represents an interesting case due to its vast size its importance to the chinese economy and the spatial variability in land and water uses across the basin from densely populated urban areas to sparsely populated agricultural areas and spatial and temporal variability of water supply the period 2010 2014 including a relatively dry year 2010 and a relatively wet year 2013 yrcc 2011 yrcc 2014 is chosen as study period since it represents the inter annual hydrological variability of the yrb and the monthly blue wf data at high spatial resolution are available xie et al 2020 zhuo et al 2016 we investigate two allocation principles use what is there principle and a principle that aims at reserving blue water for downstream consumption in combination with alternative conditions these principles are used to set bwf caps at sub catchment level according to four scenarios i use what is there principle excluding reservoirs ii use what is there principle including the operation of reservoirs iii cap setting based on the spatial distribution of the population at present including reservoirs and iv cap setting based on the spatial distribution of the water demand in recent history including reservoirs compared to the study by zhuo et al 2019 that also focused on the yrb we consider an additional method to calculate efr 2 methods and data 2 1 overview of methods the applied methods and data are summarized in fig 1 each scenario indicated as described in the previous paragraph i to iv monthly bwf caps m3 month per sub catchment are determined from monthly bwa per sub catchment and alternative spatial between sub catchments water allocation scenarios monthly bwa is aggregated from water availability accounts per day at a high spatial resolution and per hydrological response unit in the soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 1998 the swat model used for simulating the hydrological cycle initially was successfully calibrated and validated at a monthly time scale by xie et al 2020 however for the current study we required daily natural runoff results for the inclusion of travel time the travel time through the reach per sub catchment which is in the order of several days is needed to determine when in which month bwa in a particular sub catchment is available in sub catchments further downstream when the cap is transferred from upstream to downstream consequently we require daily natural runoff to determine the monthly bwf caps since it is difficult to obtain natural runoff results for calibration and validation due to the early human influence on the runoff an additional daily validation was performed for two hydrological stations in the upper reach of the yrb located at tangnaihai and lanzhou for the period 2010 2014 this area of the yrb has experienced little less human influence and better resembles natural runoff literature showed that this area is on average accountable for two thirds of the annual generated natural runoff in the yrb gu et al 2019 li et al 2008 zhuo et al 2019 by using this area a large part of the natural runoff is validated the results of this validation are displayed in table 1 daily bwa in a sub catchment is the sum of local bwa and non consumed bwa flowing in from upstream sub catchments mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 whereby we consider the travel time in days through the river channel in each sub catchment the daily bwa is calculated at the outlet of each sub catchment as uniform location for all sub catchments local bwa in each sub catchment is calculated by subtracting the efr from locally generated natural runoff the efr are calculated according to the variable monthly flow method vmf pastor et al 2014 as well as the presumptive standard approach pre richter et al 2012 in that respect we innovate upon the study by zhuo et al 2019 that also focused on the yrb but only applied the pre method the vmf method determines efr based on high intermediate and low flow regimes at which 30 45 and 60 of natural runoff is reserved for the environment the pre method determines efr as a constant percentage of 80 of natural runoff without distinguishing between flow regimes pastor et al 2014 investigated multiple efr estimation methods and compared locally assessed actual environmental blue water needs with the results of multiple methods they showed that the vmf s results were most compatible with actual environmental blue water requirements therefore we focus in the analysis on our vmf based results and compare these with the pre based results in the supplementary information figs s6 to s13 in general terms we define four scenarios to determine monthly bwf caps per sub catchment based on three alternative allocation principles to distribute monthly bwa over the sub catchments and the in exclusion of reservoir operations the natural scenario that applies the use what is there principle but excludes the effects of reservoirs the reservoir scenario that applies the use what is there principle including the operation of reservoirs the population based scenario that applies cap setting based on the spatial distribution of the population for 2010 including reservoirs the demand based scenario that applies cap setting based on the spatial distribution of the water demand in recent history 2000 2009 including reservoirs the reservoir scenario acts as a base case to evaluate the effects of the two alternative cap setting strategies i e allocation principles compared to the use what is there principle the natural scenario is added to show the effects of reservoirs on bwf caps similar to zhuo et al 2019 the population based scenario takes the relative population size per sub catchment as the basis for water allocation which makes sense from the perspective of equity and fair sharing of natural resources the demand based scenario takes the historical water demand as the basis for water allocation which is a realistic option to consider for river basin managers aiming to reduce environmental flow violations by setting bwf caps the implementation of these scenarios is detailed in section 2 3 finally we evaluate monthly bws levels defined as the bwf divided by the bwf cap mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 in all sub catchments by comparing actual bwf estimates with the alternative bwf caps for each month in the period 2010 2014 following hoekstra et al 2012 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 bws is classified into four classes no or low water scarcity bwf does not exceed the bwf cap 0 bws 1 moderate water scarcity 1 bws 1 5 significant water scarcity 1 5 bws 2 and severe water scarcity bws 2 data sources are described in section 2 4 2 2 study area the yrb is the second largest river basin in china with a drainage area of 7 53 105 km2 the main river channel s length is 5464 km wu et al 2018 the basin is located in the northern part of china and its elevation ranges from 1 to 6199 m jiang et al 2016 the basin is commonly divided into three reaches upper middle and lower reach yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 zhuo et al 2019 in the current study the yrb is divided into 31 sub catchments that are automatically delineated by swat based on the evaluation distribution fig 2 gives an overview and a schematization of the yrb because of the monsoon climate the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation is heterogeneous most precipitation occurs in the period between june and september and increases from northwest to southeast tang et al 2008 the average annual natural runoff is 58 109 m3 year or 77 mm year hua and cui 2018 the importance of the yellow river can be illustrated by the 107 million people that are directly supported by the river liu et al 2008 the yrb plays a vital role in china s agricultural production the cultivated area in the basin is 129 103 km2 13 of china s total however it only holds 2 of the country s freshwater resources the combination of the agricultural bwf and the bwf of household and industry have led to moderate and severe water scarcity during several months per year hoekstra et al 2012 zhuo et al 2016 zhuo et al 2019 the current study considers the bwf cap in the situation with and without reservoirs the five major mainstream reservoirs included are longyangxia liujiaxia wanjiazhai sanmenxia and xiaolangdi locations in fig 2 are adopted from zhuo et al 2019 by the end of 2014 the total storage capacity of all reservoirs in the yrb was around 1 2 times the average annual natural runoff or 72 109 m3 year ran and lu 2012 the total storage capacity of the five reservoirs is 78 of the basin s total storage capacity 2 3 determination of bwf caps according to four alternative scenarios 2 3 1 natural scenario the natural scenario considers the current natural circumstances in the basin which is to be understood as the situation with current land use and no reservoirs for the land use map applied see fig s1 and applies the use what is there allocation principle this principle states that a sub catchment s bwf cap is equal to the total bwa in the sub catchment the bwf cap calculation for sub catchment x at time t is displayed in eq 1 the local component bwa local is the result of locally generated blue water minus efr in sub catchment x the upstream component bwa up is the amount of blue water that enters the sub catchment from an upstream sub catchment that remains after consumption in the upstream sub catchment 1 bwf cap x t bwa local x t bwa up x t the upstream component is calculated according to eq 2 the amount of water that enters sub catchment x is estimated by subtracting the upstream actual bwf from the corresponding bwf cap the travel time through the river section of sub catchment x t x is included in this component the blue water from the upstream sub catchment at t t x corresponds with the bwf cap in sub catchment x at time t since it travels through the channel in x before it reaches its outlet where the bwa for x is estimated 2 bwa up x t max bwf cap x 1 t t x bwf x 1 t t x 0 2 3 2 reservoir scenario the reservoir scenario is similar to the natural scenario and applies the use what is there allocation principle and considers current land use the addition for this scenario is the operation of the five major reservoirs in the main river the effect of the operation of the reservoirs on the bwf cap is influenced by the location of the reservoirs in a sub catchment the outlets of sub catchments that contain a reservoir are pinpointed as the actual location of the reservoirs therefore the reservoirs are implemented at the outlet of a sub catchment the operation of a reservoir can directly affect two sub catchments the sub catchment it is located in and the sub catchment directly downstream blue water retention in a reservoir directly reduces the bwf cap in the sub catchment it is located in because blue water that is being retained is not available for consumption the blue water retention indirectly reduces the bwf cap in downstream sub catchments in the month it is retained as well since less water flows downstream during that month release of blue water from a reservoir does not affect the bwf cap of the sub catchment it is located in because it is at the outlet of the sub catchment thereby assuming the reservoir supplies water to users downstream only however reservoir releases directly increase the bwf cap in the downstream sub catchment and indirectly in the sub catchments further downstream the effect of the reservoirs on the bwf cap in sub catchment x on day t is summarized in eqs 3 6 the operation of reservoirs is based on observed stored water volume changes in the reservoirs these changes are daily implemented by dividing the monthly changes uniformly over the days of the month if δ s x t 0 3 bwf cap x t m a x bwa local x t bwa up x t δ s x t 0 4 bwf cap x 1 t bwa local x 1 t bwa up x t if δ s x t 0 5 bwf cap x t bwa local x t bwa up x t 6 bwf cap x 1 t bwa local x 1 t bwa up x t δ s x t t x 1 where δ s is the storage change adjusted for the effect of net precipitation on the reservoir s surface area note a positive storage change indicates blue water retention and a negative storage change indicates blue water release the sub catchment containing the reservoir is denoted with x and the one directly downstream with x 1 the timing of the blue water release in sub catchment x for the bwf cap in sub catchment x 1 at time t corresponds with t t x 1 where t x 1 is the travel time through the river section in sub catchment x 1 the bwf cap cannot be negative hence the maximization function 2 3 3 population based scenario an allocation based on the use what is there principle favours upstream sub catchments since the bwf cap is based on the total bwa without considering other sub catchments however the largest part of the population in the yrb lives in the downstream area of the basin redcp 2010 see fig s2 the spatial division of blue water over the basin in previous scenarios leads to an unequal distribution of blue water over the population van der zaag et al 2002 proposed a method to divide blue water resources equally over the population of riparian countries in a transboundary river basin that method can be translated to the sub catchment configuration of the yrb the interdependency between sub catchments is expressed as the responsibility of a sub catchment to supply blue water to sub catchments downstream the amount of water a sub catchment is entitled to or entitled blue water availability ebwa depends on the amount of blue water sustainably available from sub catchment x to the most downstream sub catchment n and the relative population size of x compared to the total population from x to n these components are summarized in eq 7 bwa down represents the bwa in sub catchment x and all sub catchments downstream of x from x to n illustrated by eq 8 7 ebwa x bwa up x bwa down x p x i x n p i 8 bwa down x i x n bwa local i the index of summation i denotes which sub catchments are considered for either the relative population size or bwa down in both cases the sub catchments considered are sub catchment x and all sub catchments downstream of x from x to n the method by van der zaag et al 2002 is intended for the allocation of blue water on an annual scale and between riparian countries along the mainstream of a river we apply two adjustments to their method to allocate bwa on a monthly scale and between sub catchments a third adjustment is needed to properly account for the effect of reservoirs the first adjustment is to include the travel time of water through the river allocating water from upstream to downstream sub catchments implies that upstream sub catchments reserve water intended for downstream areas when reserving water in sub catchment x in timestep t we should take into account the time it takes for the water to arrive in downstream sub catchment i hence when determining a sub catchment s ebwa bwa down refers to water that is in the downstream sub catchments at later time steps the bwa in downstream sub catchment i is considered in the ebwa calculation for sub catchment x at the same moment the water from x will arrive at i local bwa in downstream sub catchment i is considered in the ebwa calculation for sub catchment x at t t i x time t plus the travel time from the outlet of x to the outlet of i this calculation is done for every sub catchment downstream of x until the most downstream sub catchment n and the contributions are then summed to obtain bwa down for sub catchment x the second adjustment follows from the schematized delineation of sub catchments in fig 2 the schematization indicates the presence of tributary sub catchments bwa entering the mainstream from these sub catchments adds to the estimation of bwa down for sub catchment x blue water that enters the mainstream depends on the bwf cap and the actual bwf in the tributary sub catchment since this blue water influences bwa down for mainstream sub catchments the bwf cap of tributary sub catchments must be calculated before bwf caps of sub catchments along the mainstream can be calculated a tributary sub catchment is considered as the most upstream sub catchment of its river system for the calculation of the bwf cap this river system consists of the tributary sub catchment the first sub catchment in the mainstream and all downstream mainstream sub catchments bwa down of an upstream tributary sub catchment thus depends on bwa from downstream tributary sub catchments that enter the mainstream therefore the bwf cap of tributary sub catchments is calculated in downstream to upstream order the third adjustment is the inclusion of reservoirs the inclusion of reservoirs has a two sided effect on the calculation of sub catchments x s bwf cap see section 2 3 2 it influences bwa up by retention or release in an upstream reservoir and it influences bwa down by retention or release in a downstream reservoir the influence in bwa up is straightforward either a decrease or an increase due to retention or release however the influence on bwa down is more complex bwa down is not merely the sum of local bwa from the sub catchments and storage changes of reservoirs this would imply that local bwa in a downstream sub catchment can be considered for retention in an upstream reservoir which is incorrect because water only flows downstream we have assumed that local bwa in a sub catchment affects the retention of the first reservoir downstream section 2 3 2 therefore we calculate bwa down for six different sections j of the mainstream determined by looking at the location of the five reservoirs fig 2 the bwa of every section is calculated to determine bwa down of sub catchment x the first step in calculating the bwa of section j is to determine the location of section j with respect to the location of sub catchment x there are three possibilities section j is upstream of x x is within section j or section j is downstream of x these options and their effect are displayed in fig 3 in the schematization m represents the most downstream sub catchment in section j and h the most upstream sub catchment in section j the first option results in a bwa in section j to zero the second option can be translated to eq 9 where bwa is the sum of the local bwa from x to the most downstream in the section sub catchment m

where the bwa in each section is estimated by one of the three possibilities the final adjustment is to convert the ebwa of a sub catchment to an actual bwf cap this adjustment is to check ebwa with the actual bwa present in sub catchment x at day t bwa x t this ensures that no more blue water is allocated than present in the sub catchment resulting in eq 11 for the population based bwf cap 11 bwf cap x t min bwa up x t bwa down x t p x i x n p i bwa x t the sum of the calculated bwa up and bwa down is multiplied with a population based allocation factor similar to the factor in eq 7 2 3 4 demand based scenario the demand based allocation scenario aims to allocate water to the sub catchments with the largest blue water consumption which are not necessarily the most populated sub catchments the largest blue water consumer in the yrb is agriculture and it is considerably larger than the consumption of household and industry see fig s3 the land use map in fig s1 shows that agricultural areas are not necessarily near the most densely populated sub catchments the demand based allocation factor is determined using a multi year average of the bwf of a sub catchment in recent history the bwf data used for this multi year average is from a 10 year period from 2000 to 2009 the monthly multi year averages are used to determine a monthly demand based allocation factor per sub catchment eq 12 shows the calculation of the bwf cap according to the demand based scenario 12 bwf cap x t min bwa down x t bwa up x t bwf 2000 2009 x m i x n bwf 2000 2009 i m bwa x t where bwf 2000 2009 m x is the average bwf of sub catchment x in month m over the period 2000 2009 this is divided by the summation of monthly average bwf from 2000 to 2009 from sub catchment x to most downstream sub catchment n the other components are the same as the components in eq 11 2 4 data the swat model requires a digital elevation model dem land use map soil class map and meteorological data for the simulation of natural runoff in the yrb the dem was obtained from the national elevation dataset from the united states geological survey usgs at 15 sec grid level usgs 2019 the land use

population per square km were retrieved from the resource and environment data cloud platform redcp 2010 the bwf data of household and industry in the yrb from 2000 to 2014 were available at subarea level between two hydrological station in the basin from the yrcc yrcc 2015 dividing the total basin in seven areas see fig s4 finally the bwf data of agriculture from 2000 to 2014 at 5 arc minute resolution were obtained from wang et al 2019 3 results 3 1 natural runoff the natural runoff represents the hydrology of the yrb under the current land use conditions without human water abstractions and acts as a reference in evaluating the effects of bwf caps on spatiotemporal blue water allocation the annual average 2010 2014 simulated natural runoff in the yrb is 64 1010 m3 year the monthly average natural runoff with each sub catchment s contribution is depicted in fig 4 the upper reach provides a large part of the natural runoff during the dry months december to may of the year during the wet months june to october of the year the other parts of the basin have a proportionally larger contribution to the natural runoff 3 2 monthly bwf caps under alternative bwf cap scenarios the effect of alternative water allocation scenarios within the yrb on the monthly bwf caps determined using the vmf method to estimate efr are visualized in fig 5 for four characteristic sub catchments see fig 2 for their location sub catchment 17 fig 5a characterizes an upstream sub catchment with a small population size and low blue water demand both relative to the other sub catchments and contains a reservoir sub catchment 2 fig 5b characterizes a sub catchment in the middle stream with a medium population size and high blue water demand sub catchment 23 fig 5c characterizes a tributary sub catchment with a medium population size and medium blue water demand sub catchment 18 fig 5d characterizes the most downstream sub catchment with a large population size and high blue water demand as indicated in section 2 we focus our analysis on the vmf based results and elaborate upon differences with the pre method in the discussion section 4 in the natural scenario the bwf caps follow the pattern of natural runoff but are lower because the caps account for efr the bwf caps decrease from upstream to downstream this is expected since this scenario applies the use what is there principle meaning that upstream sub catchments can use bwa without reserving parts of it for downstream sub catchments consequently during dry periods of the year the downstream bwf caps approach zero in the reservoir scenario the operation of the reservoirs alters the timing of bwa also in this scenario because of the use what is there principle we observe that the bwf caps decrease from upstream to downstream the effects of reservoirs on the bwf caps depend on the location of sub catchments with respect to the reservoirs the upstream sub catchment 17 fig 5a retains water in a reservoir but does not benefit from releases from upstream reservoirs since there are none present therefore the bwf cap in the reservoir scenario and the other scenarios that contain reservoirs operations is always below the cap in the natural scenario for this sub catchment the operation of reservoirs has no effect on the bwf cap of tributary sub catchments fig 5c because we only considered five reservoirs in the mainstream for middle stream and downstream reservoirs we confirm the findings of zhuo et al 2019 that reservoirs increase the bwf cap in the dry season because of reservoir releases and decrease the cap in the wet season because of reservoir retention in the population and demand based scenarios bwf caps are moved from upstream to downstream sub catchments compared to the other scenarios which are based on the use what is there principle water is reserved not consumed in upstream sub catchments for the benefit of downstream sub catchments sub catchment 17 fig 5a has both a small population size and a low historical blue water demand and must therefore reserve bwa for downstream sub catchments in both the population and demand based bwf cap scenarios the result is exceptionally low bwf caps in this sub catchment compared to the natural and reservoir scenarios sub catchment 2 fig 5b has a medium population size but a high historical blue water demand and is therefore allocated more blue water i e has a higher bwf cap in the demand based than in the population based scenario the downstream sub catchment 18 fig 5d with both a large population size and high historical blue water demand clearly benefits from the population and demand based scenarios in terms of increasing bwf caps particularly in the dry season when blue water demands peak where in the natural and reservoir scenarios the bwf caps are close to zero the tributary sub catchment fig 5c has a medium population size and historical blue water demand leading to similar bwf caps the decrease in bwf caps for the population and demand based scenarios compared to the natural and reservoir scenarios show that tributary sub catchments also reserve bwa for downstream sub catchments in sub catchments 2 and 18 fig 5b and d which both have a relatively high historical blue water demand compared to other sub catchments one can see that the bwf caps in the demand based scenario have as expected the best match with actual blue water demand bwf this does not mean that the actual bwf is always below bwa see fig 5b in particular in the demand based scenario because bwa is constrained by natural runoff minus efr furthermore there is some minor difference between the historical bwf 2000 2009 that was used to determine the height of the caps and the bwf in the more recent period of 2010 2014 that was used to evaluate the caps with respect to blue water demand see fig s5 3 3 water scarcity levels across the yrb under alternative bwf cap scenarios as illustrated for four sub catchments in fig 5 monthly exceedance of the bwf cap varies among the scenarios and exceedance of the bwf cap occurs in all scenarios during parts of the year generally bws is most pronounced in summer months due to the mismatch between bwa which is low and the actual bwf which rises due to crop s irrigation needs the effect of alternative bwf cap scenarios on the spatial distribution of the water scarcity in the summer months is displayed in fig 6 bws is calculated per month fig 6 depicts the average bws ratio during the summer months june to august in 2010 2014 similar figures for the other seasons spring autumn and winter are shown in figs s6 s8 respectively the effect of the use what is there principle is visible in fig 6a and b bws increases from upstream to downstream since upstream sub catchments can use bwa without having to reserve not consume parts of it for downstream sub catchments comparing fig 6a and b one can see that reservoirs reduce bws particularly in sub catchments downstream of the first and second reservoir up to the reservoir in the northeast of the yrb the two most downstream reservoirs cause a local reduction of bws in the sub catchments just downstream the reason for bws reduction in the entire area between the second and the third reservoir instead of just local reduction like for the two most downstream reservoirs is the size and corresponding release of the two most upstream reservoirs these two reservoirs account for approximately 60 of the total storage capacity of the five reservoirs as a result the reservoirs can release large amounts of water in combination with a smaller upstream bwf the released water travels further downstream than for the other reservoirs causing bws to decrease reservoirs release water in summer which causes severe bws to occur further downstream compared to the natural scenario compared to the natural and reservoir scenario fig 6a and b which are based on the use what is there principle we see that when water is reserved for downstream uses in the population and demand based scenarios fig 6c and d the bws levels in the upstream part of the yrb increase while bws levels decrease in the lower reach and some sub catchments in the middle reach this means that regional differences in the degree of bws between upstream and downstream reduce fig 6 shows bws according to the common classification scheme and consequently does not show changes in bws within classes particularly in the class bws 5 therefore the bws ratio per reach per cap setting scenario for each of the four seasons and as an annual average are shown in table 2 in the upper reach bws increases from the reservoir scenario to the population and demand based scenarios since water is reserved for downstream sub catchments consequently bws reduces in the middle and lower reaches this effect is somewhat stronger in the demand based than the population based scenario especially in the middle reach differences in bws between the upper middle and lower reaches are smallest for the demand based scenario despite the partial mitigation of bws in parts of the river basin as a result of alternative bwf cap setting bws 1 in spring and summer and bws 1 during these seasons in the middle reach this means that in these cases environmental flow violations occur the mismatch between blue water availability and demand in the yrb during the spring and summer is too large to mitigate blue water scarcity by the alternative bwf cap setting scenarios alone when the actual bwf exceeds the cap indicating environmental flow violation this effect propagates downstream the bwf cap in a sub catchment partly depends on the bwa coming from the sub catchment directly upstream whenever an upstream sub catchment consumes the entire cap bws 1 the subsequent sub catchment does not receive the upstream part of non consumed bwa this effect is strongest for the sub catchments just before the reservoirs and the end of the middle reach sanmenxia and xiaolangdi see fig 2 and are furthest away from the reservoir at the start of the middle reach wanjiazhai see fig 2 the population based allocation principle aims for equal water sharing amongst the population within the river basin to evaluate the effectiveness of the cap setting in this respect table 3 shows the water availability per capita for the three reaches in the yrb per cap setting scenario the population based allocation indeed leads to the most equal distribution of blue water availability per capita over the three reaches the reservoir scenario which is based on the use what is there principle translates to the largest upstream downstream differences in blue water availability per capita the demand based scenario also leads to smaller upstream downstream differences in blue water availability per capita compared to the reservoir scenario the numbers in table 3 can be contextualized with the blue water crowding index of falkenmark et al 1989 according to this indicator areas are said to experience water stress with blue water availability of 1000 1700 m3 capita year water scarcity with 500 1000 m3 capita year and absolute water scarcity with 500 m3 capita year rijsberman 2006 when comparing changes in this indicator from the reservoir scenario to the population and demand based scenarios the upper reach moves from no water stress to water stress the middle reach remains classified as water stressed although per capita water availability increases in the population and demand based scenarios and the lower reach moves from water scarcity to water stress 4 discussion we have postulated that setting bwf caps per sub catchment while accounting for downstream demands can mitigate bws in parts of large river basins we assessed this for the case of the yrb and found indeed that severe bws in parts of the yrb can be mitigated by setting bwf caps per sub catchment based on relative with respect to other sub catchments population size or historical blue water demand since these two allocation principles in contrast to the use what is there principle account for downstream water demands bws levels downstream reduce while they increase in upstream sub catchments such that upstream downstream differences in the severity of bws reduce 4 1 allocation scenarios and implementation one can argue that accounting for downstream uses resulting in a reduction of upstream downstream differences in the severity of bws is more equitable than the use what is there principle because it implies that the burden of bws in terms of environmental damages or benefits foregone as result of water limitations is more equally spread between upstream and downstream areas in the basin the demand based scenario is somewhat more effective in this respect that the population based scenario on the other hand the population based scenario achieves the smallest differences in blue water availability per capita across the upper middle and lower reaches both allocation scenarios thus generate in different ways a more equitable water allocation in the yrb than the use what is there principle in that sense both scenarios have potential for policy implementation the implementation of bwf caps in policy is not common and several challenges need to be tackled for bwf caps to become effective and practical concepts in policy making as discussed by hogeboom et al 2020 and grafton et al 2014 the alternative principles to determine bwf caps and their effects on blue water scarcity and per capita water availability as evaluated in this study can feed such discussions towards implementation of bwf caps on this note we would like to make two remarks regarding the demand based scenario first the allocation scenario is only effective when the spatiotemporal pattern of the current demand matches that of the historical demand second this scenario entitles more water to a sub catchment with a large historical water demand as such it dis incentivizes measures to reduce water demand therefore it could be more appropriate to use an estimated reasonable water demand for a sub catchment as a basis for bwf cap setting at the sub catchment level that reasonable amount could be estimated as the total water demand in the case that all activities in the sub catchment would reduce their process bwf to certain benchmark levels set by the best available practices or achieved by the most efficient water users in the sub catchment hoekstra 2020 4 2 assumptions and limitations this study has a few assumptions and limitations that deserve further clarification first our results depend on the chosen method to determine efr and hence bwa there are no governmental regulations of efr for the yrb thus we chose to use efr estimation methods to determine the efrs in the basin zhuo et al 2019 to investigate how bws depends on the chosen efrs we used two efr estimation methods we have decided to present the results based on the variable monthly flow method vmf to estimate efr instead of the presumptive standard approach pre see section 2 vmf distinguished between flow regimes and between 30 and 60 of natural runoff is reserved for the environment where 30 corresponds with a high flow regime and 60 with a low flow regime pre does not consider flow regime and constantly reserves 80 for the environment the effect of the two methods to estimate efr is expressed as the difference in bwf caps and bws generally the bwf caps are larger for vmf than for pre where the difference is largest for the high flow regime due to the largest difference between the vmf and pre percentage to determine efr the effect on bwf caps applying pre to estimate efr is displayed in fig s9 the bws differences are in line with differences in bwf caps the spatial pattern of bws for pre correspond with the pattern for vmf but the bws values are more severe the maps based on pre for the four scenarios are displayed in figs s10 s13 respectively a second limitation of the study is that we only included five mainstream reservoirs because we did not have data on reservoir changes for other reservoirs as a consequence we probably overestimate bws in sub catchments downstream of reservoirs that were not included in this study this applies for both mainstream and tributary sub catchments for sub catchments in the mainstream we expect this error to be small since the reservoirs we included account for 78 of the total storage capacity in the yrb ran and lu 2012 and all mainstream sub catchments downstream of the included reservoirs benefit from their effect on bwa for tributary sub catchments that have reservoirs in place this could have led to a significant overestimation of bws we indeed observe high bws values in tributary sub catchments the reservoirs in the tributary rivers account for only 6 of the storage capacity based on the location of reservoirs from ran and lu 2012 within tributary sub catchments defined in this study however in a tributary sub catchment with little blue water demand a small reservoir could already alleviate bws significantly by excluding them in the current study the bws in tributary sub catchments probably is overestimated a third limitation of the study is the configuration of tributary sub catchments in the population and demand based scenarios currently these tributary sub catchments are considered as the most upstream sub catchment in their river system and are responsible for blue water in downstream sub catchments however they are fully dependent on the local bwa as opposed to mainstream sub catchments the responsibility to supply water to downstream mainstream sub catchments causes bws to increase in the scenarios that do not consider other sub catchments in blue water allocation compared to the two scenarios that do while tributary sub catchments often already experience severe bws in the natural and reservoir scenarios bws increases in de population and demand based scenarios this occurs in seasons when mainstream sub catchments do not necessarily require bwa from tributary sub catchments this is caused by the fact that population and demand based allocation principles consider other sub catchments in determining the right to blue water ebwa and not necessarily the need of blue water of the mainstream sub catchments this could be prevented by applying the use what is there principle locally for tributary sub catchments however this is not a general solution since the relation between tributary and mainstream sub catchments might be different in other basins another solution could be to include a component that accounts for the actual bwf of a downstream sub catchment or the effect on bws of a certain blue water distribution this component could be used to allocate blue water to the sub catchment that benefits most a fourth assumption that needs to be pointed out is that the operation of the five major reservoirs is taken as the observed stored water volume changes for the reservoir population and demand based scenarios these three scenarios consider the same amounts of water being released or retained by the reservoirs as input for the cap setting our model did not allow for the optimization of reservoir operations to possibly achieve a more desirable water allocation according to relative population size of historical water demand however such an optimization would be rather hypothetical anyway since reservoir operations are in practice tuned to fulfil a range of purposes next to water supply including hydroelectricity generation and flood control zhuo et al 2019 a final note of attention is that in this study in contrast to some of the allocation scenarios in van der zaag et al 2002 we do not explicitly account for the availability of green water the precipitation water in the unsaturated zone of the soil that can be made productive in agriculture and forestry in the allocation of blue water resources in the demand based scenario we do implicitly account for green water because the historical blue water demand of agriculture has been estimated with a crop growth model that accounts for green water when estimating blue water needs wang et al 2019 although we endorse the relevance of green water in the economy schyns et al 2015 schyns et al 2019 we had a couple of reasons not to explicitly incorporate green water in our blue water allocation scenarios the argument to consider green water in blue water allocation is that a sub catchment rich in green water can use that water to grow crops and timber and to sustain grazing systems and therefore is less in need of additional blue water however the technical implementation of this idea in a method for bwf cap setting is problematic first the question arises how to value green versus blue water since green and blue water cannot be made productive in the same way and for the same uses for example blue water can be taken from rivers and groundwater bodies and used in irrigated agriculture industries and households elsewhere green water is land bound and can only be made productive in the economy for biomass growth in agriculture or forestry this is the reason why green water use generally has lower opportunity costs than blue water use aldaya et al 2010 this is also reflected in the assessment by van der zaag et al 2002 who assume that green water has half the value compared to blue water and acknowledge that this is an important variable to reach consensus between riparian countries in the context of transboundary water sharing second it is not straightforward to determine green water availability for each sub catchment since green water availability not only depends on the size of the green water flows which follows from a hydrological model like swat that we used but also on where these flows can actually be made productive in agriculture and forestry schyns et al 2019 part of the green water flows will occur in areas unsuitable for agriculture or forestry because of biophysical constraints e g too steep slopes too extreme temperatures or infertile soils or because they need to be preserved for terrestrial ecosystems similarly to efr which are subtracted from natural blue water runoff future research may tackle these challenges and focus on how to best account for green water in blue water allocation and bwf cap setting 5 conclusion we have investigated alternative allocation scenarios to determine monthly bwf caps per sub catchment of the yrb and evaluated the effects on bws levels experienced across the yrb this study confirms a number of findings of previous studies on bws in the yrb i bws is most severe in spring and summer zhuo et al 2016 ii reservoir releases in the dry season reduce bws levels in these months while bws levels increase in the wet months when water is needed to fill the reservoirs zhuo et al 2019 iii bws increases from upstream to downstream when the use what is there principle of water allocation is applied zhuo et al 2019 we have shown that this third point is no longer true when a different water allocation principle is applied that considers downstream sub catchments in bwf cap setting by means of relative population sizes or relative historical demand in those cases regional differences between upstream and downstream bwf caps and bws reduce the demand based scenario results in the smallest upstream downstream differences in bws the population based scenario also reduces upstream downstream differences in bws compared to the use what is there principle and results in the smallest upstream downstream differences in water availability per capita we thus conclude that setting bwf caps per sub catchment can mitigate water scarcity in parts of a large river basin it remains to be investigated what are the most appropriate combinations of allocation principles and how these can be

the best means for precise water flux measurements under field conditions pütz et al 2016 singh et al 2018 van der laan et al 2014 von unold and fank 2008 lysimeters have been used extensively for

induced by crop rotation diversification abdalla et al 2019 for different soil types have rarely been examined with the degree of precision that lysimeter facilities afford new high precision lower boundary controlled third generation lysimeters measure soil water dynamics at high temporal resolutions hertel and von unold 2014 pütz et al 2016 facilities with multiple high precision lysimeters are fundamental for testing the effects of agricultural practices on ses since all treatments can be subject to the same natural environmental conditions these modern facilities have been used to examine the leaching of dissolved of organic and inorganic carbon herbrich et al 2017 for crop model intercomparison studies to simulate crop growth and soil water fluxes groh et al 2020 to study soil nitrogen dynamics as affected by climate change fu et al 2017 giraud et al 2021 to identify soil physical properties bravo et al 2020 herbrich and gerke 2017a and to examine lateral subsurface flow ehrhardt et al 2021 treatment effects are evaluated using the accumulations of high frequency measurements over daily monthly seasonal and annual scales these third generation weighing lysimeters consist of an undisturbed soil monolith and an accompanying drainage tank each resting on three individual load cells the change in weight of both the monolith and the drainage tank are then used to directly measure water balance components nolz et al 2013 load cells used in high precision lysimeters are reported to have a measurement resolution of 10 g equivalent to 0 01 mm over a 1 m2 surface area hannes et al 2015 however this precision does not necessarily translate to a similar degree of precision in water balance measurements across multiple co located lysimeters during typical operation each lysimeter is an independent instrument and like all instrumentation measurement variations will exist between devices in addition each soil lysimeter is comprised of an individual soil monolith extracted from a field site each with unique characteristics such as soil texture horizon thickness and soil hydraulic properties heterogeneities between lysimeters can confound any differences in soil water balance measurements that may be observed between treatments groh et al 2018b raij et al 2018 the relatively high cost of large high precision lysimeters typically limits treatment replicates to three fu et al 2017 groh et al 2020 spatial heterogeneities between soil cores within the same treatment group could blur any treatment effects on water balance variables hence in a facility dedicated to the comparison of crop rotation practices it is essential to characterize the spatial variability in water balance components between soil lysimeter replicates under baseline conditions before diversification is implemented that is the responses of water balance components between different lysimeters need to be evaluated before treatments start in addition to intrinsic soil core differences spatial variations between lysimeter water balance measurements can be caused by mechanical or outside influences such as wind and field operations lysimeter placement on the load cells requires keeping the soil core floating freely with no contact with the surrounding surface as any constraint or interference can result in incorrect weight measurements rahmati et al 2020 and these effects can vary between lysimeters a notable environmental influence is the degree of vegetation surrounding each lysimeter which has been shown to impact water balance measurements allen et al 2011 hagenau et al 2015 found that p measured by two adjacent identically treated lysimeters varied by 100 mm over a growing season due to a slight increase in exposure of one lysimeter from a nearby pathway differences in the amount of vegetation on the lysimeter surface can also cause water balance variations since et rates and intercepted p are closely tied to vegetation cover balykin et al 2016 lazarovitch et al 2006 wegehenkel and gerke 2013 spatial variability calculated directly from lysimeter measurements contain an unknown additional degree of uncertainty from data processing procedures surface pressure changes from wind is known to cause noise in weight measurements of up to 1 mm over daily time scales marek et al 2014 nolz et al 2013 van bavel and myers 1962 wind induced noise smoothing algorithms can lead to over or underestimations of water balance variables depending on the choices made for filtering thresholds peters et al 2017 schrader et al 2013 thus the true value of the water balance variables is unknown due to the uncertainty caused by measurement noise peters et al 2014 variability of lysimeter water balance measurements due to awat parameter settings was assessed during algorithm development and focused on varying some parameters while holding others constant in order to find optimal settings nolz et al 2013 peters et al 2017 2014 with numerous different user defined awat parameter settings the impact of the multiple possible combinations of choices of these values has not been investigated this degree of uncertainty needs to be quantified because the uncertainties of water balance sums related to smoothing can be of the same magnitude as measurement variability between lysimeters hannes et al 2015 other measurement uncertainties stem from data gaps due to mechanical breakdowns and disturbances associated with field operations e g planting weeding on the lysimeter surface data gap filling is essential to derive water balance sums for lysimeter treatment comparisons lysimeter et and d can be gap filled individually using models or machine learning algorithms huang et al 2020 rahmati et al 2020 raij et al 2018 these procedures produce high quality replications of the et signal at high temporal resolution 30 to 60 min but may not be practical for ongoing lysimeter data processing the p et and d can be gap filled simultaneously using water balance measurements from replicate lysimeters i e lysimeters with the same soil type and treatment in combination with data from weather stations giraud et al 2021 groh et al 2020 rahmati et al 2020 schneider et al 2021 linear interpolations of lysimeter weight gaps evett et al 2012 hannes et al 2015 hirschi et al 2017 oberholzer et al 2017 have also been used however linearly interpolating over significant changes in weight can lead to underestimations of p and et schrader et al 2013 any bias errors associated with filling missing data could impact water balance comparisons the additional uncertainty from replicate lysimeters or linear interpolation gap filling methods has not been quantified adding the uncertainty due gap filling to the measured spatial variability will increase the confidence in treatment comparisons here our objectives are to 1 provide a brief description of a new high precision lysimeter facility dedicated to the evaluation of ses derived from diversification of annual crop rotations installed in 2016 in elora ontario canada 2 determine the total uncertainty of measurements induced by data smoothing and gap filling procedures and 3 characterize the spatial variability of water budget components measured by the lysimeters for the baseline year when cropping regimes were the same across all lysimeters i e before the crop diversification experiment started outcomes of this research will inform future comparisons of water budget components for other lysimeter sites and to assess crop rotation diversity effects on ses over time at our site 2 materials and methods 2 1 weighing lysimeters the weighing lysimeter facility was installed in june of 2016 at the elora research station in elora ontario canada 43 3 27 8 n 80 24 20 4 w elevation 376 m asl the site experiences a moist mid latitude climate with cold winters köppen dfb kottek et al 2006 the annual average temperature is 6 7 c and the average annual precipitation is 946 mm with 148 mm of precipitation as snow the facility is situated 2 km from an environment canada weather station and a long term micrometeorological field site machado et al 2020 the lysimeters are located within a 0 1 ha field surrounded by cropland fig 1 a within a leveled area the soil type of the site is a gleyed gray brown luvisol canadian system of soil classification the weighing lysimeters were manufactured and installed by meter group inc and are similar to those described by pütz et al 2016 and gebler et al 2015 the facility consists of 3 nests of 6 weighing lysimeters for a total of 18 lysimeters fig 1a b the main infrastructure of each nest consists of 6 cylindrical porous concrete basins 1 35 m deep diameter of 1 52 m in which lysimeters were placed each connected via underground conduits to one of three centralized service wells fig 1b 1f each lysimeter consists of a 1 5 m deep stainless steel cylinder containing a soil monolith that is 1 45 m deep with a surface area of 1 m2 the soil monoliths were extracted from two sites details below extractions involved excavating a surrounding area of 2 m2 in small depth increments 20 cm and carefully pushing a stainless steel lysimeter cylinder into the ground fig 1c full details on the extraction process can be found in hertel and von unold 2014 after the steel cylinder was fully inserted into the ground a hydraulically operated cutting mechanism consisting of two blades was used to separate the monolith at its lower end with the bottom fully secured the steel cylinder housing the monolith was lifted out of the ground a 5 cm spacer placed against the soil and a steel plate were fastened to the top the cylinder was inverted and 10 ceramic cups were installed at 1 4 m fig 1e three of the ceramic cups were each fitted with a 6 mm id tube connected to a pressure transducer to determine water potential next soil monitoring sensors were installed at various depths fig 1d table s1 and then each lysimeter was lowered into a concrete basin fig 1f where it rests on three load cells supported by a steel housing frame at the bottom of the basin the load cell resolution is 10 g which corresponds to 0 01 mm of precipitation given the lysimeter area of 1 m2 the lysimeters are taller and narrower than the concrete basins so fiberglass collars about 0 3 m tall are used to seal the gap between them fig 1g topsoil was returned to the site and adjusted to the level of the surrounding soil surface fig 1h and silicon rings were used to close the 1 2 cm gap left between the lysimeter and the fiberglass collar since the facility operates year round two spring loaded arms connected to a stepper motor were installed and are used to gently oscillate the lysimeters in the horizontal plane snow shaker to break any crusts that form between snow or ice on the lysimeter and the surrounding field avoiding a snow bridge von unold and fank 2008 and ensuring only snow present on each lysimeter is considered in the weight measurement fig 1i snow shaker operation usually commences in november in anticipation of potential snowfall one bi directional pump for each lysimeter was connected to the ceramic cups at 1 4 m depth through a drainage port the pumps either draw water out of the lysimeter or pump water in from a drainage tank one for each lysimeter placed in the service well pumping time and direction of flow is determined by an algorithm that compares the water potential at 1 4 m depth inside the lysimeter to the average reading of three tensiometers installed in the surrounding field at 1 4 m depth supplement table s1 this ensures that each lysimeter s lower boundary condition is maintained similar to field conditions avoiding artificially high or low water potential at depth each drainage tank was placed on a balance with a resolution of 1 g 0 001 mm precipitation fig 1j all sensors were connected to dataloggers placed in the service well fig 1j 1k instantaneous data from the lysimeters and drainage tanks weight and system diagnostic information pumping time and volumes were logged at a frequency of 1 min and stored by data loggers dt85 datataker thermo fisher scientific australia located in the service wells data from soil sensors were recorded every 10 min automated soil gas chambers jassal et al 2012 were installed on each lysimeter fig 1h in december of 2016 to measure soil fluxes of co2 and n2o and will be described in a forthcoming publication commercially available trail cameras browning models btc 4 14 and btc 6hd were installed in the winter of 2019 to observe changes in the snow surface of the lysimeters 2 2 soil characteristics the lysimeters contain monoliths from two contrasting soil types 9 silt loam sil and 9 loamy sand ls table 1 collected at two sites in ontario and transported to the lysimeter facility one of the collection sites was at the elora research station university of guelph ontario canada 43 38 20 2 n 80 24 36 9 w approximately 2 km from the facility where nine cores of the same soil type as the installation field were extracted the soil type at this facility is a london series degraded by cultivation which is an imperfectly drained silt loam and categorized as a gleyed gray brown luvisol canadian system of soil classification the other collection site was a commercial farm near cambridge ontario canada 43 27 27 6 n 80 20 47 5 w where another nine cores were extracted this soil type is a fox series variant which is a well drained loamy sand and categorized as an eluviated melanic brunisol canadian system of soil classification soil properties were determined using soil core samples from undisturbed areas directly adjacent to the monolith extraction sites within each of the fields at the time of lysimeter extraction table 1 summarizes horizon characteristics texture bulk density and hydraulic characteristics for each soil type the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using the constant pressure head method reynolds 2008 further details on the methods used for the soil analyses are described in supplemental materials section 2 2 3 agronomy each lysimeter is located within a 3 m wide by 10 m long plot planted with the same crop as the lysimeter core the analysis presented refers to the first year of measurements when all lysimeters were managed the same way and seeded by hand with soybeans on july 7 2016 day of year doy 188 and harvested october 19 2016 doy 293 soybeans are usually planted in may in this region but due to lysimeter installation in june planting was delayed until early july following harvest soybean residue was placed back on the lysimeters after the dry weight was determined monitoring of water balance components for this study was conducted during the soybean growing season july to october and after harvest until snowfall in december in subsequent years starting april 2017 year 2 of the three year rotation outlined in table 2 was implemented for studies on the impact of crop diversification on ses this rotation will repeat in perpetuity while the facility is operational briefly the conventional rotation consists of soybean soybean corn and the diverse rotation of soybean winter wheat corn with cover crops except for year 1 when winter wheat was not planted after soybean harvest table 2 the cover crop planted in the diverse rotation is a four species mixture after winter wheat oats cereal rye crimson clover and radish and a two way mixture rye grass crimson clover underseeded to corn at the 6th leaf stage a winter warming treatment is applied to a sub set of diverse rotation lysimeters that started in december of 2017 the schematic in fig 2 shows the layout of the lysimeter facility and identifies treatments and labels of individual lysimeters refer to lapierre et al 2021 for further details pertaining to the agronomic management of the lysimeters 2 4 data processing 2 4 1 data pre processing and noise reduction weight data from the lysimeters was processed following the steps described in peters et al 2014 hannes et al 2015 and peters et al 2017 data was first manually filtered for periods with known mechanical failures or disruptions due to maintenance or farming activities an automated filtering routine eliminated data with instrument error codes outliers of the lysimeter or balance tank weight measurements were eliminated using a threshold filter these outliers were typically due to human disturbances at the lysimeter site i e pressure changes in the service wells physical disruption of the balance tanks soil water solution sampling agronomic operations on the top of the lysimeter such as planting water balance components were calculated following the same calculation steps as those provided in the supplementary materials in hannes et al 2015 increases in lysimeter weight were assumed to be exclusively due to precipitation or dew formation collectively p and reductions solely due to et with neither process occurring simultaneously the total lysimeter weight wl was calculated using the weight of the lysimeter soil core wc and the weight of the drainage tank wd this weight was expressed in units of kg and scaled per 1 m2 of the lysimeter surface area which is equivalent to mm incorporating plant weights into wl using the equations to approximate plant biomass accumulation from herbrich and gerke 2017b resulted in only a 0 2 change in the total sums of the water balance variables as compared to the sums calculated without the estimated plant weights and was therefore not used to calculate wl smoothing of the 1 min wl measurements was necessary prior to the calculation of water balance variables because the signal noise can create artificial step changes in wl that can be misinterpreted as et or p wl was smoothed using the adaptive window and adaptive threshold awat smoothing procedure for each 1 min wl value i complete details of which can be found in peters et al 2014 briefly this routine smooths wl data in segments delimited by anchor points α to find α the signal strength bi of a moving window of data w j of length w max w max 61 min is evaluated based on the adherence of the data to a polynomial equation calculated for polynomial degrees ranging from k 1 to a maximum of k 5 of these the polynomial fit to the data that minimizes the sum of squares between the measured data and the polynomial fit sres is chosen bi was then calculated as peters et al 2014 2 b i 1 r i 2 where r 2 is the coefficient of determination between the measured data and the chosen polynomial fit a value of bi near 0 indicated that the polynomial exactly described wi and was associated with strong signals from step changes in wl periods with bi near 1 had signals that were dominated by noise the width of the adaptive windows wa was determined by 3 w a b i max w min b i w max where wmin was set at 3 min points within each wa that exceeded a threshold value δi become α the δi adapted to data in each wa based on the signal within the wa and was calculated as 4 δ i s res t 97 5 where t 97 5 is the student s t value for the two tailed 95 confidence level minimum and maximum δ i were set at 0 025 and 0 8 mm respectively such that the δmin was slightly higher than the lowest resolution of the weighing system and δmax was high enough to prevent noise from being interpreted as weight change signals peters et al 2014 data was then smoothed by linear interpolation between α values peters et al 2017 proposed a snapping routine to create additional α to improve the resolution for large step changes primarily from precipitation this method first identifies significant changes in direction in all data segments between α w i α segments with weight changes greater than a snapping threshold value δsnap 1 5 mm are identified peters et al 2017 used the upper and lower quantiles of the data within the window to determine if a new anchor needed to be included here we used an improved approach to better resolve p events an autocorrelation function was deployed to detect the time at which the individual points in w i α became decorrelated such that the point of decorrelation becomes an additional α within the wi α 2 4 2 water balance calculations the minute to minute changes in wl j were calculated as the incremental change in the filtered smoothed wl signal between two 1 min time steps ti and ti 1 5 j t i w l t i w l t i 1 t i t i 1 isolated spikes in the 1 min j points were eliminated if individual values were greater than 0 3 mm min 1 et and p were calculated at 1 min time steps such that positive values of j were defined as precipitation and negative values as evapotranspiration 6 p t i j t i j t i 0 0 j t i 0 7 e t t 0 j t i 0 j t i j t i 0 d was calculated as 8 d t i w d t i w d t i 1 t i t i 1 where positive d indicated water flowing out of the lysimeter core to the drainage tank i e pumped out negative d indicated capillary rise of water from the drainage tank to the lysimeter core i e pumped in calculated water balance variables underwent a final round of manual filtering to remove periods of lysimeter malfunctions such as leaks from the lysimeter core that were otherwise undetectable in the raw w c or w d data thus the filtering procedure was iterative the w c and w d data that corresponded to the filtered water balance data was filtered out and run through the awat smoothing procedure for a second time 2 5 assessment of variability between lysimeters data collected from aug 3 2016 doy 217 to dec 1 doy 336 was used to analyze the impact of data smoothing and gap filling on p et δs and d calculations and to assess spatial variability of p et δs and d between lysimeters winter data past doy 336 was excluded since lysimeter snowfall introduced another source of variability due to snow blowing off some lysimeters and settling on others which would have confounded the targeted analysis in on going work images of the lysimeters captured by the site cameras showing changes in snow depth are linked with wind and temperature data to evaluate the changes in weight due to snow drifting 2 5 1 uncertainty due to data smoothing the degree of error of lysimeter measurements attributable to the awat algorithm used for data smoothing was quantified the choice of parameter settings in the awat filtering routine can cause variations in cumulative sums hannes et al 2015 oberholzer et al 2017 and thus uncertainty of the true sum the effect of multiple combinations of parameter settings on cumulative water budget sums has not been previously examined to estimate the uncertainty from this processing step water balance components were calculated using the non gap filled wl data from only one lysimeter due to the computational limitations of the procedure the lysimeter labelled sil3 in fig 2 was chosen for this analysis as this lysimeter had the most complete data set based on ranges of the five awat parameters set within plausible limits table 3 960 unique parameter combinations were generated the wl data was then reprocessed 960 times following the steps in section 2 4 with each reprocessing using one of the unique awat parameter combinations using the resulting 960 1 min time series sums for daily 7 day 30 day and for the total 120 days of measurement intervals were calculated the means and standard deviations σawat of these sums were calculated for each summation period and σawat represented the uncertainty induced by data smoothing procedures the relative uncertainty attributed to differences in awat parameters was calculated as εawat σawat x 1 100 these values represented an estimate of the uncertainty that exists from the discretionary nature of setting the awat parameters 2 5 2 uncertainty due to gap filling gaps in the lysimeter measurements had the potential to introduce biases in the cumulative sums of water budget components because of the differing number of missing data points for each of the 18 lysimeters therefore gap filling was necessary to calculate realistic water balance sums two methods for filling water budget data were evaluated the first was the linear interpolation of wl data hannes et al 2015 for short gaps 7 min the interpolation used the 1 min weight data points directly adjacent to the gap for longer gaps 7 min an average of the 20 1 min data points preceding and following the gap was used as the two points for the interpolation the wl time series was then used to calculate 1 min water budget variables using the methodology in section 2 4 2 note that the linear interpolation method can only be used for data gaps that occur during periods of normal lysimeter operation and is not suitable over periods when there are known losses to the system that can be misinterpreted as et or p such as for example harvesting crops or fertilizer application for the second gap filling method et p and d measurements from replicate lysimeters of the same future treatment group fig 2 were used to fill missing data from individual lysimeters if no measurements were available within a treatment group the average of all lysimeters of the same soil type was used for any remaining missing data p measured at the weather station and the reference evapotranspiration et0 calculated from weather station data allen et al 1998 was used the degree of uncertainty in the cumulative sums attributable to each method of filling water balance gaps was assessed using the method of moffat et al 2007 this methodology is frequently used in eddy covariance studies desai et al 2008 eichelmann et al 2016 novick et al 2009 similar testing methods have only recently been applied to lysimeter data huang et al 2020 the method involves randomly removing 10 of the data using five artificial gaps lengths 60 min 4 h 1 5 d and 3 d and one being a combination of the 4 different gap lengths each of these 5 gap scenarios was applied 35 separate times resulting in 175 time series with uniquely randomized artificial gaps for each of the 18 lysimeters the artificial gaps were then filled each lysimeter was evaluated individually and pre existing gaps in the data were not filled for the linear interpolation gap filling the testing approach involved creating artificial gaps in each of the filtered awat smoothed 1 min wl time series doy 217 336 for the gap filling using data from replicate lysimeters artificial gaps were created in each of the water balance time series doy 217 336 using the resulting 175 1 min time series of water balance variables for each lysimeter sums for daily 7 day 30 day and for the total 120 days of measurement intervals were calculated the means and standard deviations σf i for the linear interpolation and σf r for the replicate lysimeter method of these sums were calculated for each summation period and the relative uncertainty attributed to the data gaps was calculated as εf i σf i x 1 100 and εf r σf r x 1 100 the pooled bias b of the cumulative sums for each water balance wb variable and interpolation method across the i 1 to n lysimeters was calculated as 9 b 1 n wb f i wb org i where wbf i is the cumulative sum of the artificially gap filled data and wborg i is the cumulative sum of the original water balance data 2 5 3 spatial variability of water budget variables 2 5 3 1 spatial variability of non gap filled data cumulative sums of et p δs and d were calculated for each lysimeter and the standard deviation of these sums across the 9 lysimeters of each soil type represented the lysimeter spatial variability due to intrinsic soil core differences differences in sensors and physical installation in addition to data smoothing procedures this was first calculated for cumulative sums of 1 min data but using only those 1 min data points in the 120 day measurement period when wl measurements were simultaneously available across all 18 lysimeters i e non gap filled data this requirement corresponded to a total of 37 4 days of consecutive and non consecutive 1 min data points for this analysis in contrast to the other analyses when a much larger proportion of data was used the calculation of the standard deviation of the water balance with non gap filled sums measured across 9 lysimeters of each soil type allowed for an assessment of spatial variability that excluded any variations from gap filling σs nf since water balance variables are calculated using the awat smoothed data the σs nf was combined with the estimated σawat such that σ s n f t o t σ s n f 2 σ awat 2 1 2 thus representing the total spatial variability with uncertainties from the awat smoothing included the total relative uncertainty was then calculated as ε s n f σ s n f t o t x 1 100 2 5 3 2 spatial variability of gap filled total water balance sums the spatially variability was then assessed using gap filled data as gap filled wl data is required to calculate realistic sums of water balance components the replicate lysimeter data filling method was used to fill data gaps in this analysis cumulative sums of et p δs and d were calculated for each lysimeter using all the gap filled data for each lysimeter over the 120 day measurement period the evaluation of the spatial variability of the water balance sums was performed for sums cumulated at daily 7 day and 30 day time scales and for the complete 120 day measurement period the standard deviation of the gap filled water balance sums across 9 lysimeters of each soil type σs f was calculated to assess the impact of spatial variability to calculate the total spatial variability with uncertainties from the awat smoothing and gap filling included the σs f was combined with the σawat and σf r such that σ s f t o t σ s f 2 σ awat 2 σ f r 2 1 2 the percent relative uncertainty was calculated as ε s f tot σ s f tot x 1 100 all σs f calculations were conducted with 9 lysimeters of each soil type to assess the impact of sample size on the spatial variability of the water balance sums i e for n 9 the standard error of the mean gap filled water balance variables measured across n 2 to 9 lysimeters of the same soil type se σs f n 1 was used the σ s f was calculated for each of the 482 unique combinations of lysimeters for each soil type average values of the se for each n group were evaluated 3 results and discussion data collected from aug 3 2016 doy 217 to dec 1 doy 336 was used for the analysis of lysimeter δs et d and p variability the time series of wl measurements is presented in fig 3 no treatments had been applied to the lysimeters during this period such that differences between lysimeters measurements were only due to plant population spatial variability from differences in soil core properties and any variations in sensor performance there were 70 21 0 established soybean plants on the sil and 67 20 7 plants on the ls lysimeters supplemental table s2 the combination of late planting and dry july conditions inhibited uniform establishment in some of the lysimeters resulting in variable plant numbers between lysimeters a gap in the data of all lysimeters from doy 279 to doy 281 was due to major maintenance operations at the site data from the harvest date doy 293 was excluded data from one of the sil lysimeters sil5 fig 2 was excluded after doy 270 due to an improper seal at the bottom of the lysimeter cylinder causing leakage after filtering for major events and the filtering described in section 2 4 2 the average data capture was 83 for the measurement period 3 1 uncertainty due to data smoothing means σawat and εawat resulting from the repeated 960 calculations of p et d and δs for the lysimeter chosen for this analysis sil3 are shown in table 4 for the total 120 days 30 day 7 day and daily sums for p the εawat p of the cumulative sum of the total p measured over the study period due to the choice of awat parameters was 1 6 this was lower than the estimate given by hannes et al 2015 of 3 the εawat p of the 30 and 7 day p sums remained low at 1 6 and 1 8 and the mean of daily εawat was slightly higher 2 6 similarly uncertainty from awat filtering was low for the et sums and consistent across the total 30 or 7 day sums εawat et 1 9 1 9 and 2 2 respectively the average of the uncertainties of the daily sums was larger εawat et 3 the σawat values for the daily p and et sums increased in the post harvest period as compared to the pre harvest period after doy 293 fig 4 a 4b σawat et displayed this occurred because after harvest the lysimeters were unsheltered and this exposure to winds generated a higher degree of wl signal noise an example is given in fig 4c where increases in wl followed increases in wind stress on the surface high signal noise is known to increase the uncertainty of the awat procedure peters et al 2017 the δmax parameter can be decreased to further smooth the signal during these periods however strong winds can create increases and decreases in wl that are inseparable from p or et processes oberholzer et al 2017 simply adjusting the awat filter parameters to increase the smoothing over these time periods could result in a loss of information if any of the changes in wl were due to water movement additional wind measurements at the site combined with p data from rain gauges would be required to separate out the strong wind effects this would improve confidence in water balance sums at shorter time scales uncertainties of δs sums were minimal for the total 30 and 7 day sums εawat δ s 0 7 1 2 and 2 1 although each individual 1 min σawat δ s calculated across the 960 iterations of the awat testing procedure equaled a propagation of the σawat of each of the remaining water balance variables in equation 1 the σawat δ s of the cumulative sums of δs did not represent a propagation of the σawat values in table 4 this is because error propagation is nonlinear and not directly additive variations in the awat parameters had little effect on d sums since the wd signals were considerably less noisy than wl as the balance tanks were not impacted by wind the awat smoothing procedure on wd rarely changed the wd signal which was apparent from the low σawat d the wd signal was smoothed for completeness and to prevent noise from vibrations or interference from field activities affecting the wd signal 3 2 uncertainty due to gap filling the uncertainty in cumulative sums of water balance components as impacted by gap filling is presented in table 5 for both the linear interpolation of wl and replicate lysimeter method for the linear interpolation method the total 120 day cumulative sums had σf i of 10 6 mm or εf i of 2 9 for p and 8 0 mm or εf i 3 2 for et variations of δs and d were lower σf i 6 8 and 1 2 mm respectively however the lesser totals of δs and d elevated the uncertainties εf i 6 9 and 8 1 as compared to p or et the εf i of the total 120 day sums of p and et for the study period table 5 were comparable to that of the εawat table 4 the εf i increased with decreasing summation time with the average weekly and daily εf i being nearly an order of magnitude larger than for the εf i of the 120 day sums and that of the corresponding daily and 7 day εawat this was not unexpected as variations associated with gap filling tend to decrease with increasing accumulation time scales chen et al 2012 the negative b values in table 5 indicated that gap filling using linear interpolation of gaps in the 1 min wl time series resulted in underestimations of all water balance variables at all cumulation time scales when positive and negative weight changes were combined in the interpolation of wl the blurring of p and et caused the underestimations hannes et al 2015 schrader et al 2013 the σf i of total sums over the 120 day measurement period increased with the length of gaps as did the degree of underestimation see example for one lysimeter loamy sand ls3 in supplemental fig s1a c which is often observed in evaluations of uncertainties associated with gap filling of time series data aubinet et al 2012 moffat et al 2007 taki et al 2019 uncertainties from filling gaps using data from replicate lysimeters were lower than that of the linear interpolation method table 5 the εf r increased slightly with decreasing summation periods and were similar in scale to that of εawat at all aggregation time scales for all water balance variables table 4 the length of gap had little effect of the degree of uncertainty in cumulative sums for all gap lengths using the replicate lysimeter method as can be seen in the example shown in supplemental fig s1b d the σf r of the 120 day cumulative sums for p and et were low and represented 0 3 and 0 5 of the totals table 5 the σf r and εf r were higher for δs and d σf r 2 2 mm and σf r 1 5 mm εf r 2 1 and 10 8 respectively this was predominantly due to the variability of d drainage was low during the measurement periods and d was rarely correlated between the majority of the lysimeters the negligible b values table 5 showed that gap filling with replicate lysimeter data did not over or underestimate the sums when compared to the sums calculated using the original non artificially gapped data with no net under or overestimation results of this analysis showed that gap filling using replicate lysimeters was preferrable to that of linear interpolation of wl the average root mean square error rsme for the daily sums was 0 18 mm d 1 data not shown which was lower than the average rsme reported when the group method of data handling hecht nielsen 1990 was used to fill lysimeter et time series rsme 0 6 mm d 1 rahmati et al 2020 however caution must be used when interpreting filled water balance components at short time scales since the εf r values increased for shorter aggregation time scales gap filling procedures to reconstruct wl signals or to directly calculate missing water balance values may decrease the uncertainty caused by missing data schrader et al 2013 especially for examinations of water balance dynamics at time scales of 7 days or less if treatments of et are being evaluated during specific time periods such as during peak growth models such as those used to fill eddy covariance measured et e g isaac et al 2017 wutzler et al 2018 could be used to fill et data filling d data is more difficult because the processes involved are tightly linked to the properties of each soil core models such as hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 could be used to model lysimeter drainage groh et al 2016 raij et al 2018 and to recreate signals for highly detailed analyses of lysimeter water balances 3 3 spatial variability of water budget variables 3 3 1 spatial variability in non gap filled data spatial variability of measurements between the lysimeters was first examined using non gap filled data over the 120 day study period there were 37 4 days of consecutive and non consecutive 1 min data points where measurements were available across all 18 lysimeters fig 3 the average of the total p measured by the 18 lysimeters and variability of those sums is given in table 6 the average sum of p was 257 7 mm for the sil 255 3 mm for the ls with maximum and minimum sums measured by individual lysimeters ranging from 1 6 and 2 5 of the mean spatial variability of sums between lysimeters was low with σs nf p values being on average within 1 3 of the mean this close measurement of p by all 18 lysimeters attested to the accuracy of the individual weighing systems the total uncertainty of the sum which included the uncertainty of the awat filtering was 1 5 of the mean p across both soil types minor differences in measured p totals were likely due to differences in crops affecting interception from variations in the degree of sheltering from the surrounding plots hagenau et al 2015 and dew formation as affected by plant numbers groh et al 2018 spatial variability of summer convective rainstorms could also affect the spatial variability of lysimeter p measurements herbrich and gerke 2017b a close examination of lags in strong p increases measured across lysimeters could help determine if any observed variability was due to the heterogeneity of convective storms the sums of total et measured by individual lysimeters showed more variation than p with σs nf et values of 5 1 and 4 4 mm representing 5 8 and 5 3 of the mean for the sil and ls respectively table 6 these spatial variations are comparable in range to the spatial variability of et measured at facilities with multiple lysimeters gebler et al 2015 groh et al 2020 incorporating the estimate of uncertainty associated with awat filtering resulted in total uncertainties of the et sums of 6 1 and 5 7 for sil and ls d was minimal with total d 5 5 3 6 mm for the sil and 3 5 5 2 mm over the 37 4 days differences in d were small relative to the other water balance variables but resulted in high errors and were primarily from adjustments to the pumping system of individual lysimeters as opposed to actual drainage or capillary rise which hampers comparisons of d between lysimeters hannes et al 2015 3 3 2 spatial variability of gap filled total water balance sums total water balance sums were calculated from the measured water balance variables that were gap filled using data from replicate lysimeters cumulative sums spatial variability and uncertainty estimates are presented in table 7 for the full 120 day period the 64 day growing season doy 217 to 280 and the 56 day post senescence post harvest period doy 281 to doy 336 total average p measured by the 18 lysimeters over the 120 days was 395 4 9 0 mm ls and 389 0 9 9 mm sil the totals were 8 greater than p recorded by a tipping bucket rain gauge at the nearby weather station which is typical of comparisons between lysimeter and rain gauge p measurements nolz et al 2013 oberholzer et al 2017 the average spatial variation of p measurements by the lysimeters excluding uncertainties from data processing σs f was 6 4 and 7 5 mm for sil and ls respectively or 1 8 of the mean p this was lower than the variation of annual p sums of 2 8 measured across similar lysimeters at an annual time scale herbrich et al 2017 and of 2 7 for a 60 day period hannes et al 2015 the spatial variability of p measured here was substantially lower than other reported lysimeter measurement variations of 5 to 12 gebler et al 2015 rahmati et al 2020 the average εs p was 2 4 between soil types and only slightly greater than the non gap filled counterpart average εnf p 1 5 table 6 this confirmed that filling lysimeter p data with that of replicate lysimeters had a minimal effect on the uncertainty of cumulative sums the σs f tot p were similar for the growing season and the non growing season table 7 which demonstrated that the amount of vegetation on the lysimeters had a minimal effect on the spatial variability of the p measurements total et over the 120 days was 339 5 19 0 mm for the sil and 302 3 13 7 mm for the ls with total uncertainties being 5 6 sil and 4 5 ls table 7 spatial variations of et sums were greater than that of p which was likely due to the differences in plant cover on each lysimeter the variability occurred primarily in the growing period with the average σs f tot et being 17 2 mm across soil types fig 5 shows that et increased with dried harvest soybean weight r2 0 76 demonstrating that the variability of the et sums can be attributed to heterogeneity of plant cover and growth between lysimeters in the non growing seasons et was lower and dominated by soil evaporation rather than plant transpiration the average σs f tot et was lower than the growing season at 8 9 mm across soil types and comparable to the non growing season σs f tot p mean σs tot p 7 8 mm demonstrating that any impacts soil core heterogeneities on evaporation were minimal weekly sums of et are shown in fig 6 mean values ranged from a maximum of 39 8 4 3 mm for the sil and 45 8 2 1 mm for the ls at the peak growing period week of doy 234 to an average minimum of 4 4 1 7 mm for both soil types post harvest week of doy 322 table s3 supplemental materials rates of et were generally higher for the ls lysimeters at the beginning of the study period doy 217 to 237 than the sil which was also a period of high p mean lysimeter p 177 mm weekly et rates for the sil exceeded that of the ls by an average of 4 9 mm during the period when the soybeans reached full maturity and throughout senescence doy 248 to 290 spatial variability of weekly et was also greater for the sil than the ls mean σs tot et 1 9 mm and σs tot et 1 5 mm respectively supplementary materials table s3 during the growing season the weekly σs tot et increased with stronger et rates this relationship was more pronounced for the sil r2 0 84 than the ls r2 0 46 even though lysimeters provide the most direct et measurement variations will exist from inevitable variations in the distribution and productivity of plants growing on the lysimeters variations in vegetation cover are well known to affect spatial variations of et alfieri et al 2012 blyth et al 2006 and the variability of et with the degree of crop cover can be inconsistent for lysimeter measurements hannes et al 2015 reported a higher degree of variability for total et 6 5 than p for lysimeters planted with an uneven winter rape crop oberholzer et al 2017 found consistent spatial variations across lysimeters of 3 for annual sums of et for a variety of crops whereas spatial variability of et ranged from 3 to 10 5 for lysimeters planted with grasses fu et al 2017 rahmati et al 2020 comparisons of water balance variables between treatments will have to be weighed by the influence that plant cover has on et rates this is further complicated by potential impacts of diversification treatments on the degree of plant cover osterholz et al 2018 the lack of clear scaling between vegetation and et rates also presents an issue when considering upscaling lysimeter results to the field scale evett et al 2012 kustas et al 2015 simple relationships between yields and et are scattered groh et al 2020 purcell et al 2007 and the variability of those relationships could outweigh variations between treatments weighing et measurements by leaf area index qu et al 2014 or plant phenology richardson et al 2013 of each lysimeter at a high temporal frequency could help to accurately scale et by plant cover to advance comparisons between treatments the average d over the 120 day measurement period was positive for both soil types table 7 indicating net water movement out of the lysimeter cores the spatial variably was 52 of the mean sums for the sil with d 20 2 10 5 mm being 1 7 times greater than the mean for the ls with d 11 7 20 3 table 7 two of the ls lysimeters had a net negative d from water being added to the lysimeter core for adjustments to the lower boundary matric potential fig 6 shows that d was inconsistent with a high degree of variation across lysimeters throughout the measurement period despite the heavier rainfall from doy 227 to 241 a dry spell with minimal precipitation prior to the 120 day study period combined with the strong et resulted in the low total d over the growing season all lysimeters had net positive d whereas in the non growing season when p was lower the majority of lysimeters had water added from the drainage tanks d table 7 to adjust the matric potential at the bottom of the lysimeter to match the field tension variability in d is common for boundary controlled lysimeters due to a combination of the impacts of matric potential automated adjustments and from the variations in soil hydraulic properties of individual lysimeters herbrich et al 2017 groh et al 2018 this was exemplified by the greater spatial variability of d for the ls lysimeters than the sil lysimeters which also could have been due to the mismatch of the ls lysimeter soil type and the soil type of the surrounding field sil groh et al 2016 demonstrated that discrepancies in soil types between lysimeter cores and the location of field tension sensors can cause significant errors in d the σs f tot d in the growing season was similar for both soil types 8 4 mm which suggested that the different soil properties between the ls lysimeters and the surrounding field did not affect the degree of variability when d is positive the δs for the 120 day period was greater for the ls 75 0 21 8 mm than the sil 35 5 14 0 mm fig 7 shows the cumulative p et and δs measured over the 120 day period the cumulative δs in fig 7 reflects the negative total δs for the growing period and the positive δs in the non growing period table 7 all lysimeters experienced a net gain of water by the end of the measurement period soil water content in this region recharges from late winter to early spring mccoy et al 2006 thus conclusions on the effects of crop diversification on δs will require seasonal to annual time scales to be meaningful the δs captures increases in wl from p and decreases from et making the spatial variability in δs and the differences in δs between soil types largely due to et fig 7 shows that δs was similar for both soil types until doy 260 when et became stronger for the sil than the ls causing δs to decrease below that of the ls the δs for the sil remained lower than the ls for the remainder of the measurement period and maintained a greater degree of spatial variability these higher et rates for the sil were in part due to the greater amount of biomass supplemental table s2 but primarily due to the greater water availability the sil has a higher amount of plant available water than the sl zeitoun et al 2021 the soil moisture θ measurements fig s2 supplemental materials showed that the sil contained more moisture at the beginning of the study period and retained higher θ throughout the growing and maturation stages this provided moisture for et during the period of low rainfall from doy 248 to 283 mean weekly p 11 1 mm fig 8 shows the se of the total 120 d cumulative sums of each of the water balance variables according to decreasing number of lysimeters used in the derivation of sums se followed the typical behavior of a decrease with n levy et al 2011 for all water balance variables and for both soil types the decreases in se were fit to a power equation slopes of the fits are presented in table 8 water balance variables with greater σ s f tot table 7 generally had steeper decreases in se with increasing n the slopes were greatest for d and δs β 17 1 and 16 1 driven by the high spatial variability of d between all lysimeters the β for the sil et was greater than that of the ls because of the higher degree of spatial variability observed in this sandier soil changes in se with n were lowest for p for both soil types and only minor differences were observed in se values of average totals using 9 or 8 and 3 lysimeters 1 5 mm thus future comparisons between treatments will require an examination of the inter lysimeter variability prior to pooling treatments particularly when considering d for et since the variability is largely controlled by the degree of plant coverage care should be taken at planting and after establishment to ensure that similar numbers of plants exist on each lysimeter within a treatment group to reduce excessive variability from the smaller sample sizes 4 conclusions uncertainty induced by data processing and data gap filling methods and spatial variability in water balance components derived from soil weighting lysimeters 9 sil and 9 ls were assessed the degree of variation from data processing procedures was evaluated variability from smoothing raw weight signals from wind induced noise was minor a substantial amount of uncertainty in water budget components can be attributed to linear interpolations of missing data filling missing values with data from replicate lysimeters greatly reduced the uncertainty of the water balance sums more sophisticated gap filling techniques should be applied to fill all water balance variables if lysimeters measurements are being evaluated at shorter time scales i e 7 days spatial variability of cumulative sums of water balance components was examined at various time scales over the 120 day measurement period all lysimeters measured p synchronously with a low degree of variation spatial variations over the 120 day measurement period of et and δs were higher than that of p but lower than ranges of variability reported in studies from similar lysimeter facilities within each group of 9 lysimeters the differences in plant cover on individual lysimeters was the main source of variation of et and δs future studies will require close attention to the plant growth in each lysimeter when evaluating the impacts of crop diversification on water balance variables this new high precision

3937,diversifying annual crop rotations is postulated to promote soil ecosystem services throughreduction of greenhouse gas emissions control of soil evaporation moderation of soil freeze thaw cycles increases in soil organic carbon and reduced nutrient leaching all of which are processes that are impacted by the waterbalance a newly installed facility with large monolithic weighing soil

this provided an opportunity to study water budget components precipitation p evapotranspiration et change is soil storage δs drainage d measured by the 9 replicate lysimeters for each soil type the objectives of this study were to1 determine the total uncertainty of p et δs and d induced bydatasmoothing and gap fillingdataprocedures and 3 characterize the spatial variability of water budget

prevent further soil degradation and increase agricultural resilience to climate change gurr et al 2016 haygarth and ritz 2009 janzen et al 2011 koch et al 2013 scholes and scholes 2013 diversifying annual crop rotations by introducing over wintering crops and cover crops into rotations is postulated to promote ses scherr and mcneely 2008 this enhancement of ses through rotation diversification is tied to improvements in soil hydraulic properties for crop growth rotation diversification has been shown to improve soil hydraulic conductivity moderate drainage and reduce runoff bacq labreuil et

2020 wagner riddle et al 2007 these improvements can then help to protect annual crops against drought and extreme precipitation events quantifying the impact of diversified annual crop rotations on hydraulic processes and the subsequent impacts on ses requires a close examination of the soil water balance and its components 1 δ s p e t d where δs is the change in soil water storage referred to as storage throughout p is precipitation et is evapotranspiration d is drainage with runoff assumed negligible for a level site these variables can be difficult to evaluate from field based biogeochemical and soil hydraulic studies because of the open nature of the soil system baffaut et al 2020 drury et al 1996 williams et al 2015 large monolithic weighing soil lysimeters are considered the best means for precise water flux measurements under field conditions pütz et al 2016 singh et al 2018 van der laan et al 2014 von unold and fank 2008 lysimeters have been used extensively for studies of crop water use nitrogen losses detailed water balance analyses and model verification carey et al 2016 eder et al 2015 evett et al 2016 howell et al 1995 lazarovitch et al 2006 loos et al 2007 oberholzer et al 2017 high frequency measurements 1 10 min have allowed for studies of soil hydraulic processes at finer temporal scales gebler et al 2015 groh et al 2018 however changes in ses induced by crop rotation diversification abdalla et al 2019 for different soil types have rarely been examined with the degree of precision that lysimeter facilities afford new high precision lower boundary controlled third generation lysimeters measure soil water dynamics at high temporal resolutions hertel and von unold 2014 pütz et al 2016 facilities with multiple high precision lysimeters are fundamental for testing the effects of agricultural practices on ses since all treatments can be subject to the same natural environmental conditions these modern facilities have been used to examine the leaching of dissolved of organic and inorganic carbon herbrich et al 2017 for crop model intercomparison studies to simulate crop growth and soil water fluxes groh et al 2020 to study soil nitrogen dynamics as affected by climate change fu et al 2017 giraud et al 2021 to identify soil physical properties bravo et al 2020 herbrich and gerke 2017a and to examine lateral subsurface flow ehrhardt et al 2021 treatment effects are evaluated using the accumulations of high frequency measurements over daily monthly seasonal and annual scales these third generation weighing lysimeters consist of an undisturbed soil monolith and an accompanying drainage tank each resting on three individual load cells the change in weight of both the monolith and the drainage tank are then used to directly measure water balance components nolz et al 2013 load cells used in high precision lysimeters are reported to have a measurement resolution of 10 g equivalent to 0 01 mm over a 1 m2 surface area hannes et al 2015 however this precision does not necessarily translate to a similar degree of precision in water balance measurements across multiple co located lysimeters during typical operation each lysimeter is an independent instrument and like all instrumentation measurement variations will exist between devices in addition each soil lysimeter is comprised of an individual soil monolith extracted from a field site each with unique characteristics such as soil texture horizon thickness and soil hydraulic properties heterogeneities between lysimeters can confound any differences in soil water balance measurements that may be observed between treatments groh et al 2018b raij et al 2018 the relatively high cost of large high precision lysimeters typically limits treatment replicates to three fu et al 2017 groh et al 2020 spatial heterogeneities between soil cores within the same treatment group could blur any treatment effects on water balance variables hence in a facility dedicated to the comparison of crop rotation practices it is essential to characterize the spatial variability in water balance components between soil lysimeter replicates under baseline conditions before diversification is implemented that is the responses of water balance components between different lysimeters need to be evaluated before treatments start in addition to intrinsic soil core differences spatial variations between lysimeter water balance measurements can be caused by mechanical or outside influences such as wind and field operations lysimeter placement on the load cells requires keeping the soil core floating freely with no contact with the surrounding surface as any constraint or interference can result in incorrect weight measurements rahmati et al 2020 and these effects can vary between lysimeters a notable environmental influence is the degree of vegetation surrounding each lysimeter which has been shown to impact water balance measurements allen et al 2011 hagenau et al 2015 found that p measured by two adjacent identically treated lysimeters varied by 100 mm over a growing season due to a slight increase in exposure of one lysimeter from a nearby pathway differences in the amount of vegetation on the lysimeter surface can also cause water balance variations since et rates and intercepted p are closely tied to vegetation cover balykin et al 2016 lazarovitch et al 2006 wegehenkel and gerke 2013 spatial variability calculated directly from lysimeter measurements contain an unknown additional degree of uncertainty from data processing procedures surface pressure changes from wind is known to cause noise in weight measurements of up to 1 mm over daily time scales marek et al 2014 nolz et al 2013 van bavel and myers 1962 wind induced noise smoothing algorithms can lead to over or underestimations of water balance variables depending on the choices made for filtering thresholds peters et al 2017 schrader et al 2013 thus the true value of the water balance variables is unknown due to the uncertainty caused by measurement noise peters et al 2014 variability of lysimeter water balance measurements due to awat parameter settings was assessed during algorithm development and focused on varying some parameters while holding others constant in order to find optimal settings nolz et al 2013 peters et al 2017 2014 with numerous different user defined awat parameter settings the impact of the multiple possible combinations of choices of these values has not been investigated this degree of uncertainty needs to be quantified because the uncertainties of water balance sums related to smoothing can be of the same magnitude as measurement variability between lysimeters hannes et al 2015 other measurement uncertainties stem from data gaps due to mechanical breakdowns and disturbances associated with field operations e g planting weeding on the lysimeter surface data gap filling is essential to derive water balance sums for lysimeter treatment comparisons lysimeter et and d can be gap filled individually using models or machine learning algorithms huang et al 2020 rahmati et al 2020 raij et al 2018 these procedures produce high quality replications of the et signal at high temporal resolution 30 to 60 min but may not be practical for ongoing lysimeter data processing the p et and d can be gap filled simultaneously using water balance measurements from replicate lysimeters i e lysimeters with the same soil type and treatment in combination with data from weather stations giraud et al 2021 groh et al 2020 rahmati et al 2020 schneider et al 2021 linear interpolations of lysimeter weight gaps evett et al 2012 hannes et al 2015 hirschi et al 2017 oberholzer et al 2017 have also been used however linearly interpolating over significant changes in weight can lead to underestimations of p and et schrader et al 2013 any bias errors associated with filling missing data could impact water balance comparisons the additional uncertainty from replicate lysimeters or linear interpolation gap filling methods has not been quantified adding the uncertainty due gap filling to the measured spatial variability will increase the confidence in treatment comparisons here our objectives are to 1 provide a brief description of a new high precision lysimeter facility dedicated to the evaluation of ses derived from diversification of annual crop rotations installed in 2016 in elora ontario canada 2 determine the total uncertainty of measurements induced by data smoothing and gap filling procedures and 3 characterize the spatial variability of water budget components measured by the lysimeters for the baseline year when cropping regimes were the same across all lysimeters i e before the crop diversification experiment started outcomes of this research will inform future comparisons of water budget components for other lysimeter sites and to assess crop rotation diversity effects on ses over time at our site 2 materials and methods 2 1 weighing lysimeters the weighing lysimeter facility was installed in june of 2016 at the elora research station in elora ontario canada 43 3 27 8 n 80 24 20 4 w elevation 376 m asl the site experiences a moist mid latitude climate with cold winters köppen dfb kottek et al 2006 the annual average temperature is 6 7 c and the average annual precipitation is 946 mm with 148 mm of precipitation as snow the facility is situated 2 km from an environment canada weather station and a long term micrometeorological field site machado et al 2020 the lysimeters are located within a 0 1 ha field surrounded by cropland fig 1 a within a leveled area the soil type of the site is a gleyed gray brown luvisol canadian system of soil classification the weighing lysimeters were manufactured and installed by meter group inc and are similar to those described by pütz et al 2016 and gebler et al 2015 the facility consists of 3 nests of 6 weighing lysimeters for a total of 18 lysimeters fig 1a b the main infrastructure of each nest consists of 6 cylindrical porous concrete basins 1 35 m deep diameter of 1 52 m in which lysimeters were placed each connected via underground conduits to one of three centralized service wells fig 1b 1f each lysimeter consists of a 1 5 m deep stainless steel cylinder containing a soil monolith that is 1 45 m deep with a surface area of 1 m2 the soil monoliths were extracted from two sites details below extractions involved excavating a surrounding area of 2 m2 in small depth increments 20 cm and carefully pushing a stainless steel lysimeter cylinder into the ground fig 1c full details on the extraction process can be found in hertel and von unold 2014 after the steel cylinder was fully inserted into the ground a hydraulically operated cutting mechanism consisting of two blades was used to separate the monolith at its lower end with the bottom fully secured the steel cylinder housing the monolith was lifted out of the ground a 5 cm spacer placed against the soil and a steel plate were fastened to the top the cylinder was inverted and 10 ceramic cups were installed at 1 4 m fig 1e three of the ceramic cups were each fitted with a 6 mm id tube connected to a pressure transducer to determine water potential next soil monitoring sensors were installed at various depths fig 1d table s1 and then each lysimeter was lowered into a concrete basin fig 1f where it rests on three load cells supported by a steel housing frame at the bottom of the basin the load cell resolution is 10 g which corresponds to 0 01 mm of precipitation given the lysimeter area of 1 m2 the lysimeters are taller and narrower than the concrete basins so fiberglass collars about 0 3 m tall are used to seal the gap between them fig 1g topsoil was returned to the site and adjusted to the level of the surrounding soil surface fig 1h and silicon rings were used to close the 1 2 cm gap left between the lysimeter and the fiberglass collar since the facility operates year round two spring loaded arms connected to a stepper motor were installed and are used to gently oscillate the lysimeters in the horizontal plane snow shaker to break any crusts that form between snow or ice on the lysimeter and the surrounding field avoiding a snow bridge von unold and fank 2008 and ensuring only snow present on each lysimeter is considered in the weight measurement fig 1i snow shaker operation usually commences in november in anticipation of potential snowfall one bi directional pump for each lysimeter was connected to the ceramic cups at 1 4 m depth through a drainage port the pumps either draw water out of the lysimeter or pump water in from a drainage tank one for each lysimeter placed in the service well pumping time and direction of flow is determined by an algorithm that compares the water potential at 1 4 m depth inside the lysimeter to the average reading of three tensiometers installed in the surrounding field at 1 4 m depth supplement table s1 this ensures that each lysimeter s lower boundary condition is maintained similar to field conditions avoiding artificially high or low water potential at depth each drainage tank was placed on a balance with a resolution of 1 g 0 001 mm precipitation fig 1j all sensors were connected to dataloggers placed in the service well fig 1j 1k instantaneous data from the lysimeters and drainage tanks weight and system diagnostic information pumping time and volumes were logged at a frequency of 1 min and stored by data loggers dt85 datataker thermo fisher scientific australia located in the service wells data from soil sensors were recorded every 10 min automated soil gas chambers jassal et al 2012 were installed on each lysimeter fig 1h in december of 2016 to measure soil fluxes of co2 and n2o and will be described in a forthcoming publication commercially available trail cameras browning models btc 4 14 and btc 6hd were installed in the winter of 2019 to observe changes in the snow surface of the lysimeters 2 2 soil characteristics the lysimeters contain monoliths from two contrasting soil types 9 silt loam sil and 9 loamy sand ls table 1 collected at two sites in ontario and transported to the lysimeter facility one of the collection sites was at the elora research station university of guelph ontario canada 43 38 20 2 n 80 24 36 9 w approximately 2 km from the facility where nine cores of the same soil type as the installation field were extracted the soil type at this facility is a london series degraded by cultivation which is an imperfectly drained silt loam and categorized as a gleyed gray brown luvisol canadian system of soil classification the other collection site was a commercial farm near cambridge ontario canada 43 27 27 6 n 80 20 47 5 w where another nine cores were extracted this soil type is a fox series variant which is a well drained loamy sand and categorized as an eluviated melanic brunisol canadian system of soil classification soil properties were determined using soil core samples from undisturbed areas directly adjacent to the monolith extraction sites within each of the fields at the time of lysimeter extraction table 1 summarizes horizon characteristics texture bulk density and hydraulic characteristics for each soil type the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using the constant pressure head method reynolds 2008 further details on the methods used for the soil analyses are described in supplemental materials section 2 2 3 agronomy each lysimeter is located within a 3 m wide by 10 m long plot planted with the same crop as the lysimeter core the analysis presented refers to the first year of measurements when all lysimeters were managed the same way and seeded by hand with soybeans on july 7 2016 day of year doy 188 and harvested october 19 2016 doy 293 soybeans are usually planted in may in this region but due to lysimeter installation in june planting was delayed until early july following harvest soybean residue was placed back on the lysimeters after the dry weight was determined monitoring of water balance components for this study was conducted during the soybean growing season july to october and after harvest until snowfall in december in subsequent years starting april 2017 year 2 of the three year rotation outlined in table 2 was implemented for studies on the impact of crop diversification on ses this rotation will repeat in perpetuity while the facility is operational briefly the conventional rotation consists of soybean soybean corn and the diverse rotation of soybean winter wheat corn with cover crops except for year 1 when winter wheat was not planted after soybean harvest table 2 the cover crop planted in the diverse rotation is a four species mixture after winter wheat oats cereal rye crimson clover and radish and a two way mixture rye grass crimson clover underseeded to corn at the 6th leaf stage a winter warming treatment is applied to a sub set of diverse rotation lysimeters that started in december of 2017 the schematic in fig 2 shows the layout of the lysimeter facility and identifies treatments and labels of individual lysimeters refer to lapierre et al 2021 for further details pertaining to the agronomic management of the lysimeters 2 4 data processing 2 4 1 data pre processing and noise reduction weight data from the lysimeters was processed following the steps described in peters et al 2014 hannes et al 2015 and peters et al 2017 data was first manually filtered for periods with known mechanical failures or disruptions due to maintenance or farming activities an automated filtering routine eliminated data with instrument error codes outliers of the lysimeter or balance tank weight measurements were eliminated using a threshold filter these outliers were typically due to human disturbances at the lysimeter site i e pressure changes in the service wells physical disruption of the balance tanks soil water solution sampling agronomic operations on the top of the lysimeter such as planting water balance components were calculated following the same calculation steps as those provided in the supplementary materials in hannes et al 2015 increases in lysimeter weight were assumed to be exclusively due to precipitation or dew formation collectively p and reductions solely due to et with neither process occurring simultaneously the total lysimeter weight wl was calculated using the weight of the lysimeter soil core wc and the weight of the drainage tank wd this weight was expressed in units of kg and scaled per 1 m2 of the lysimeter surface area which is equivalent to mm incorporating plant weights into wl using the equations to approximate plant biomass accumulation from herbrich and gerke 2017b resulted in only a 0 2 change in the total sums of the water balance variables as compared to the sums calculated without the estimated plant weights and was therefore not used to calculate wl smoothing of the 1 min wl measurements was necessary prior to the calculation of water balance variables because the signal noise can create artificial step changes in wl that can be misinterpreted as et or p wl was smoothed using the adaptive window and adaptive threshold awat smoothing procedure for each 1 min wl value i complete details of which can be found in peters et al 2014 briefly this routine smooths wl data in segments delimited by anchor points α to find α the signal strength bi of a moving window of data w j of length w max w max 61 min is evaluated based on the adherence of the data to a polynomial equation calculated for polynomial degrees ranging from k 1 to a maximum of k 5 of these the polynomial fit to the data that minimizes the sum of squares between the measured data and the polynomial fit sres is chosen bi was then calculated as peters et al 2014 2 b i 1 r i 2 where r 2 is the coefficient of determination between the measured data and the chosen polynomial fit a value of bi near 0 indicated that the polynomial exactly described wi and was associated with strong signals from step changes in wl periods with bi near 1 had signals that were dominated by noise the width of the adaptive windows wa was determined by 3 w a b i max w min b i w max where wmin was set at 3 min points within each wa that exceeded a threshold value δi become α the δi adapted to data in each wa based on the signal within the wa and was calculated as 4 δ i s res t 97 5 where t 97 5 is the student s t value for the two tailed 95 confidence level minimum and maximum δ i were set at 0 025 and 0 8 mm respectively such that the δmin was slightly higher than the lowest resolution of the weighing system and δmax was high enough to prevent noise from being interpreted as weight change signals peters et al 2014 data was then smoothed by linear interpolation between α values peters et al 2017 proposed a snapping routine to create additional α to improve the resolution for large step changes primarily from precipitation this method first identifies significant changes in direction in all data segments between α w i α segments with weight changes greater than a snapping threshold value δsnap 1 5 mm are identified peters et al 2017 used the upper and lower quantiles of the data within the window to determine if a new anchor needed to be included here we used an improved approach to better resolve p events an autocorrelation function was deployed to detect the time at which the individual points in w i α became decorrelated such that the point of decorrelation becomes an additional α within the wi α 2 4 2 water balance calculations the minute to minute changes in wl j were calculated as the incremental change in the filtered smoothed wl signal between two 1 min time steps ti and ti 1 5 j t i w l t i w l t i 1 t i t i 1 isolated spikes in the 1 min j points were eliminated if individual values were greater than 0 3 mm min 1 et and p were calculated at 1 min time steps such that positive values of j were defined as precipitation and negative values as evapotranspiration 6 p t i j t i j t i 0 0 j t i 0 7 e t t 0 j t i 0 j t i j t i 0 d was calculated as 8 d t i w d t i w d t i 1 t i t i 1 where positive d indicated water flowing out of the lysimeter core to the drainage tank i e pumped out negative d indicated capillary rise of water from the drainage tank to the lysimeter core i e pumped in calculated water balance variables underwent a final round of manual filtering to remove periods of lysimeter malfunctions such as leaks from the lysimeter core that were otherwise undetectable in the raw w c or w d data thus the filtering procedure was iterative the w c and w d data that corresponded to the filtered water balance data was filtered out and run through the awat smoothing procedure for a second time 2 5 assessment of variability between lysimeters data collected from aug 3 2016 doy 217 to dec 1 doy 336 was used to analyze the impact of data smoothing and gap filling on p et δs and d calculations and to assess spatial variability of p et δs and d between lysimeters winter data past doy 336 was excluded since lysimeter snowfall introduced another source of variability due to snow blowing off some lysimeters and settling on others which would have confounded the targeted analysis in on going work images of the lysimeters captured by the site cameras showing changes in snow depth are linked with wind and temperature data to evaluate the changes in weight due to snow drifting 2 5 1 uncertainty due to data smoothing the degree of error of lysimeter measurements attributable to the awat algorithm used for data smoothing was quantified the choice of parameter settings in the awat filtering routine can cause variations in cumulative sums hannes et al 2015 oberholzer et al 2017 and thus uncertainty of the true sum the effect of multiple combinations of parameter settings on cumulative water budget sums has not been previously examined to estimate the uncertainty from this processing step water balance components were calculated using the non gap filled wl data from only one lysimeter due to the computational limitations of the procedure the lysimeter labelled sil3 in fig 2 was chosen for this analysis as this lysimeter had the most complete data set based on ranges of the five awat parameters set within plausible limits table 3 960 unique parameter combinations were generated the wl data was then reprocessed 960 times following the steps in section 2 4 with each reprocessing using one of the unique awat parameter combinations using the resulting 960 1 min time series sums for daily 7 day 30 day and for the total 120 days of measurement intervals were calculated the means and standard deviations σawat of these sums were calculated for each summation period and σawat represented the uncertainty induced by data smoothing procedures the relative uncertainty attributed to differences in awat parameters was calculated as εawat σawat x 1 100 these values represented an estimate of the uncertainty that exists from the discretionary nature of setting the awat parameters 2 5 2 uncertainty due to gap filling gaps in the lysimeter measurements had the potential to introduce biases in the cumulative sums of water budget components because of the differing number of missing data points for each of the 18 lysimeters therefore gap filling was necessary to calculate realistic water balance sums two methods for filling water budget data were evaluated the first was the linear interpolation of wl data hannes et al 2015 for short gaps 7 min the interpolation used the 1 min weight data points directly adjacent to the gap for longer gaps 7 min an average of the 20 1 min data points preceding and following the gap was used as the two points for the interpolation the wl time series was then used to calculate 1 min water budget variables using the methodology in section 2 4 2 note that the linear interpolation method can only be used for data gaps that occur during periods of normal lysimeter operation and is not suitable over periods when there are known losses to the system that can be misinterpreted as et or p such as for example harvesting crops or fertilizer application for the second gap filling method et p and d measurements from replicate lysimeters of the same future treatment group fig 2 were used to fill missing data from individual lysimeters if no measurements were available within a treatment group the average of all lysimeters of the same soil type was used for any remaining missing data p measured at the weather station and the reference evapotranspiration et0 calculated from weather station data allen et al 1998 was used the degree of uncertainty in the cumulative sums attributable to each method of filling water balance gaps was assessed using the method of moffat et al 2007 this methodology is frequently used in eddy covariance studies desai et al 2008 eichelmann et al 2016 novick et al 2009 similar testing methods have only recently been applied to lysimeter data huang et al 2020 the method involves randomly removing 10 of the data using five artificial gaps lengths 60 min 4 h 1 5 d and 3 d and one being a combination of the 4 different gap lengths each of these 5 gap scenarios was applied 35 separate times resulting in 175 time series with uniquely randomized artificial gaps for each of the 18 lysimeters the artificial gaps were then filled each lysimeter was evaluated individually and pre existing gaps in the data were not filled for the linear interpolation gap filling the testing approach involved creating artificial gaps in each of the filtered awat smoothed 1 min wl time series doy 217 336 for the gap filling using data from replicate lysimeters artificial gaps were created in each of the water balance time series doy 217 336 using the resulting 175 1 min time series of water balance variables for each lysimeter sums for daily 7 day 30 day and for the total 120 days of measurement intervals were calculated the means and standard deviations σf i for the linear interpolation and σf r for the replicate lysimeter method of these sums were calculated for each summation period and the relative uncertainty attributed to the data gaps was calculated as εf i σf i x 1 100 and εf r σf r x 1 100 the pooled bias b of the cumulative sums for each water balance wb variable and interpolation method across the i 1 to n lysimeters was calculated as 9 b 1 n wb f i wb org i where wbf i is the cumulative sum of the artificially gap filled data and wborg i is the cumulative sum of the original water balance data 2 5 3 spatial variability of water budget variables 2 5 3 1 spatial variability of non gap filled data cumulative sums of et p δs and d were calculated for each lysimeter and the standard deviation of these sums across the 9 lysimeters of each soil type represented the lysimeter spatial variability due to intrinsic soil core differences differences in sensors and physical installation in addition to data smoothing procedures this was first calculated for cumulative sums of 1 min data but using only those 1 min data points in the 120 day measurement period when wl measurements were simultaneously available across all 18 lysimeters i e non gap filled data this requirement corresponded to a total of 37 4 days of consecutive and non consecutive 1 min data points for this analysis in contrast to the other analyses when a much larger proportion of data was used the calculation of the standard deviation of the water balance with non gap filled sums measured across 9 lysimeters of each soil type allowed for an assessment of spatial variability that excluded any variations from gap filling σs nf since water balance variables are calculated using the awat smoothed data the σs nf was combined with the estimated σawat such that σ s n f t o t σ s n f 2 σ awat 2 1 2 thus representing the total spatial variability with uncertainties from the awat smoothing included the total relative uncertainty was then calculated as ε s n f σ s n f t o t x 1 100 2 5 3 2 spatial variability of gap filled total water balance sums the spatially variability was then assessed using gap filled data as gap filled wl data is required to calculate realistic sums of water balance components the replicate lysimeter data filling method was used to fill data gaps in this analysis cumulative sums of et p δs and d were calculated for each lysimeter using all the gap filled data for each lysimeter over the 120 day measurement period the evaluation of the spatial variability of the water balance sums was performed for sums cumulated at daily 7 day and 30 day time scales and for the complete 120 day measurement period the standard deviation of the gap filled water balance sums across 9 lysimeters of each soil type σs f was calculated to assess the impact of spatial variability to calculate the total spatial variability with uncertainties from the awat smoothing and gap filling included the σs f was combined with the σawat and σf r such that σ s f t o t σ s f 2 σ awat 2 σ f r 2 1 2 the percent relative uncertainty was calculated as ε s f tot σ s f tot x 1 100 all σs f calculations were conducted with 9 lysimeters of each soil type to assess the impact of sample size on the spatial variability of the water balance sums i e for n 9 the standard error of the mean gap filled water balance variables measured across n 2 to 9 lysimeters of the same soil type se σs f n 1 was used the σ s f was calculated for each of the 482 unique combinations of lysimeters for each soil type average values of the se for each n group were evaluated 3 results and discussion data collected from aug 3 2016 doy 217 to dec 1 doy 336 was used for the analysis of lysimeter δs et d and p variability the time series of wl measurements is presented in fig 3 no treatments had been applied to the lysimeters during this period such that differences between lysimeters measurements were only due to plant population spatial variability from differences in soil core properties and any variations in sensor performance there were 70 21 0 established soybean plants on the sil and 67 20 7 plants on the ls lysimeters supplemental table s2 the combination of late planting and dry july conditions inhibited uniform establishment in some of the lysimeters resulting in variable plant numbers between lysimeters a gap in the data of all lysimeters from doy 279 to doy 281 was due to major maintenance operations at the site data from the harvest date doy 293 was excluded data from one of the sil lysimeters sil5 fig 2 was excluded after doy 270 due to an improper seal at the bottom of the lysimeter cylinder causing leakage after filtering for major events and the filtering described in section 2 4 2 the average data capture was 83 for the measurement period 3 1 uncertainty due to data smoothing means σawat and εawat resulting from the repeated 960 calculations of p et d and δs for the lysimeter chosen for this analysis sil3 are shown in table 4 for the total 120 days 30 day 7 day and daily sums for p the εawat p of the cumulative sum of the total p measured over the study period due to the choice of awat parameters was 1 6 this was lower than the estimate given by hannes et al 2015 of 3 the εawat p of the 30 and 7 day p sums remained low at 1 6 and 1 8 and the mean of daily εawat was slightly higher 2 6 similarly uncertainty from awat filtering was low for the et sums and consistent across the total 30 or 7 day sums εawat et 1 9 1 9 and 2 2 respectively the average of the uncertainties of the daily sums was larger εawat et 3 the σawat values for the daily p and et sums increased in the post harvest period as compared to the pre harvest period after doy 293 fig 4 a 4b σawat et displayed this occurred because after harvest the lysimeters were unsheltered and this exposure to winds generated a higher degree of wl signal noise an example is given in fig 4c where increases in wl followed increases in wind stress on the surface high signal noise is known to increase the uncertainty of the awat procedure peters et al 2017 the δmax parameter can be decreased to further smooth the signal during these periods however strong winds can create increases and decreases in wl that are inseparable from p or et processes oberholzer et al 2017 simply adjusting the awat filter parameters to increase the smoothing over these time periods could result in a loss of information if any of the changes in wl were due to water movement additional wind measurements at the site combined with p data from rain gauges would be required to separate out the strong wind effects this would improve confidence in water balance sums at shorter time scales uncertainties of δs sums were minimal for the total 30 and 7 day sums εawat δ s 0 7 1 2 and 2 1 although each individual 1 min σawat δ s calculated across the 960 iterations of the awat testing procedure equaled a propagation of the σawat of each of the remaining water balance variables in equation 1 the σawat δ s of the cumulative sums of δs did not represent a propagation of the σawat values in table 4 this is because error propagation is nonlinear and not directly additive variations in the awat parameters had little effect on d sums since the wd signals were considerably less noisy than wl as the balance tanks were not impacted by wind the awat smoothing procedure on wd rarely changed the wd signal which was apparent from the low σawat d the wd signal was smoothed for completeness and to prevent noise from vibrations or interference from field activities affecting the wd signal 3 2 uncertainty due to gap filling the uncertainty in cumulative sums of water balance components as impacted by gap filling is presented in table 5 for both the linear interpolation of wl and replicate lysimeter method for the linear interpolation method the total 120 day cumulative sums had σf i of 10 6 mm or εf i of 2 9 for p and 8 0 mm or εf i 3 2 for et variations of δs and d were lower σf i 6 8 and 1 2 mm respectively however the lesser totals of δs and d elevated the uncertainties εf i 6 9 and 8 1 as compared to p or et the εf i of the total 120 day sums of p and et for the study period table 5 were comparable to that of the εawat table 4 the εf i increased with decreasing summation time with the average weekly and daily εf i being nearly an order of magnitude larger than for the εf i of the 120 day sums and that of the corresponding daily and 7 day εawat this was not unexpected as variations associated with gap filling tend to decrease with increasing accumulation time scales chen et al 2012 the negative b values in table 5 indicated that gap filling using linear interpolation of gaps in the 1 min wl time series resulted in underestimations of all water balance variables at all cumulation time scales when positive and negative weight changes were combined in the interpolation of wl the blurring of p and et caused the underestimations hannes et al 2015 schrader et al 2013 the σf i of total sums over the 120 day measurement period increased with the length of gaps as did the degree of underestimation see example for one lysimeter loamy sand ls3 in supplemental fig s1a c which is often observed in evaluations of uncertainties associated with gap filling of time series data aubinet et al 2012 moffat et al 2007 taki et al 2019 uncertainties from filling gaps using data from replicate lysimeters were lower than that of the linear interpolation method table 5 the εf r increased slightly with decreasing summation periods and were similar in scale to that of εawat at all aggregation time scales for all water balance variables table 4 the length of gap had little effect of the degree of uncertainty in cumulative sums for all gap lengths using the replicate lysimeter method as can be seen in the example shown in supplemental fig s1b d the σf r of the 120 day cumulative sums for p and et were low and represented 0 3 and 0 5 of the totals table 5 the σf r and εf r were higher for δs and d σf r 2 2 mm and σf r 1 5 mm εf r 2 1 and 10 8 respectively this was predominantly due to the variability of d drainage was low during the measurement periods and d was rarely correlated between the majority of the lysimeters the negligible b values table 5 showed that gap filling with replicate lysimeter data did not over or underestimate the sums when compared to the sums calculated using the original non artificially gapped data with no net under or overestimation results of this analysis showed that gap filling using replicate lysimeters was preferrable to that of linear interpolation of wl the average root mean square error rsme for the daily sums was 0 18 mm d 1 data not shown which was lower than the average rsme reported when the group method of data handling hecht nielsen 1990 was used to fill lysimeter et time series rsme 0 6 mm d 1 rahmati et al 2020 however caution must be used when interpreting filled water balance components at short time scales since the εf r values increased for shorter aggregation time scales gap filling procedures to reconstruct wl signals or to directly calculate missing water balance values may decrease the uncertainty caused by missing data schrader et al 2013 especially for examinations of water balance dynamics at time scales of 7 days or less if treatments of et are being evaluated during specific time periods such as during peak growth models such as those used to fill eddy covariance measured et e g isaac et al 2017 wutzler et al 2018 could be used to fill et data filling d data is more difficult because the processes involved are tightly linked to the properties of each soil core models such as hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 could be used to model lysimeter drainage groh et al 2016 raij et al 2018 and to recreate signals for highly detailed analyses of lysimeter water balances 3 3 spatial variability of water budget variables 3 3 1 spatial variability in non gap filled data spatial variability of measurements between the lysimeters was first examined using non gap filled data over the 120 day study period there were 37 4 days of consecutive and non consecutive 1 min data points where measurements were available across all 18 lysimeters fig 3 the average of the total p measured by the 18 lysimeters and variability of those sums is given in table 6 the average sum of p was 257 7 mm for the sil 255 3 mm for the ls with maximum and minimum sums measured by individual lysimeters ranging from 1 6 and 2 5 of the mean spatial variability of sums between lysimeters was low with σs nf p values being on average within 1 3 of the mean this close measurement of p by all 18 lysimeters attested to the accuracy of the individual weighing systems the total uncertainty of the sum which included the uncertainty of the awat filtering was 1 5 of the mean p across both soil types minor differences in measured p totals were likely due to differences in crops affecting interception from variations in the degree of sheltering from the surrounding plots hagenau et al 2015 and dew formation as affected by plant numbers groh et al 2018 spatial variability of summer convective rainstorms could also affect the spatial variability of lysimeter p measurements herbrich and gerke 2017b a close examination of lags in strong p increases measured across lysimeters could help determine if any observed variability was due to the heterogeneity of convective storms the sums of total et measured by individual lysimeters showed more variation than p with σs nf et values of 5 1 and 4 4 mm representing 5 8 and 5 3 of the mean for the sil and ls respectively table 6 these spatial variations are comparable in range to the spatial variability of et measured at facilities with multiple lysimeters gebler et al 2015 groh et al 2020 incorporating the estimate of uncertainty associated with awat filtering resulted in total uncertainties of the et sums of 6 1 and 5 7 for sil and ls d was minimal with total d 5 5 3 6 mm for the sil and 3 5 5 2 mm over the 37 4 days differences in d were small relative to the other water balance variables but resulted in high errors and were primarily from adjustments to the pumping system of individual lysimeters as opposed to actual drainage or capillary rise which hampers comparisons of d between lysimeters hannes et al 2015 3 3 2 spatial variability of gap filled total water balance sums total water balance sums were calculated from the measured water balance variables that were gap filled using data from replicate lysimeters cumulative sums spatial variability and uncertainty estimates are presented in table 7 for the full 120 day period the 64 day growing season doy 217 to 280 and the 56 day post senescence post harvest period doy 281 to doy 336 total average p measured by the 18 lysimeters over the 120 days was 395 4 9 0 mm ls and 389 0 9 9 mm sil the totals were 8 greater than p recorded by a tipping bucket rain gauge at the nearby weather station which is typical of comparisons between lysimeter and rain gauge p measurements nolz et al 2013 oberholzer et al 2017 the average spatial variation of p measurements by the lysimeters excluding uncertainties from data processing σs f was 6 4 and 7 5 mm for sil and ls respectively or 1 8 of the mean p this was lower than the variation of annual p sums of 2 8 measured across similar lysimeters at an annual time scale herbrich et al 2017 and of 2 7 for a 60 day period hannes et al 2015 the spatial variability of p measured here was substantially lower than other reported lysimeter measurement variations of 5 to 12 gebler et al 2015 rahmati et al 2020 the average εs p was 2 4 between soil types and only slightly greater than the non gap filled counterpart average εnf p 1 5 table 6 this confirmed that filling lysimeter p data with that of replicate lysimeters had a minimal effect on the uncertainty of cumulative sums the σs f tot p were similar for the growing season and the non growing season table 7 which demonstrated that the amount of vegetation on the lysimeters had a minimal effect on the spatial variability of the p measurements total et over the 120 days was 339 5 19 0 mm for the sil and 302 3 13 7 mm for the ls with total uncertainties being 5 6 sil and 4 5 ls table 7 spatial variations of et sums were greater than that of p which was likely due to the differences in plant cover on each lysimeter the variability occurred primarily in the growing period with the average σs f tot et being 17 2 mm across soil types fig 5 shows that et increased with dried harvest soybean weight r2 0 76 demonstrating that the variability of the et sums can be attributed to heterogeneity of plant cover and growth between lysimeters in the non growing seasons et was lower and dominated by soil evaporation rather than plant transpiration the average σs f tot et was lower than the growing season at 8 9 mm across soil types and comparable to the non growing season σs f tot p mean σs tot p 7 8 mm demonstrating that any impacts soil core heterogeneities on evaporation were minimal weekly sums of et are shown in fig 6 mean values ranged from a maximum of 39 8 4 3 mm for the sil and 45 8 2 1 mm for the ls at the peak growing period week of doy 234 to an average minimum of 4 4 1 7 mm for both soil types post harvest week of doy 322 table s3 supplemental materials rates of et were generally higher for the ls lysimeters at the beginning of the study period doy 217 to 237 than the sil which was also a period of high p mean lysimeter p 177 mm weekly et rates for the sil exceeded that of the ls by an average of 4 9 mm during the period when the soybeans reached full maturity and throughout senescence doy 248 to 290 spatial variability of weekly et was also greater for the sil than the ls mean σs tot et 1 9 mm and σs tot et 1 5 mm respectively supplementary materials table s3 during the growing season the weekly σs tot et increased with stronger et rates this relationship was more pronounced for the sil r2 0 84 than the ls r2 0 46 even though lysimeters provide the most direct et measurement variations will exist from inevitable variations in the distribution and productivity of plants growing on the lysimeters variations in vegetation cover are well known to affect spatial variations of et alfieri et al 2012 blyth et al 2006 and the variability of et with the degree of crop cover can be inconsistent for lysimeter measurements hannes et al 2015 reported a higher degree of variability for total et 6 5 than p for lysimeters planted with an uneven winter rape crop oberholzer et al 2017 found consistent spatial variations across lysimeters of 3 for annual sums of et for a variety of crops whereas spatial variability of et ranged from 3 to 10 5 for lysimeters planted with grasses fu et al 2017 rahmati et al 2020 comparisons of water balance variables between treatments will have to be weighed by the influence that plant cover has on et rates this is further complicated by potential impacts of diversification treatments on the degree of plant cover osterholz et al 2018 the lack of clear scaling between vegetation and et rates also presents an issue when considering upscaling lysimeter results to the field scale evett et al 2012 kustas et al 2015 simple relationships between yields and et are scattered groh et al 2020 purcell et al 2007 and the variability of those relationships could outweigh variations between treatments weighing et measurements by leaf area index qu et al 2014 or plant phenology richardson et al 2013 of each lysimeter at a high temporal frequency could help to accurately scale et by plant cover to advance comparisons between treatments the average d over the 120 day measurement period was positive for both soil types table 7 indicating net water movement out of the lysimeter cores the spatial variably was 52 of the mean sums for the sil with d 20 2 10 5 mm being 1 7 times greater than the mean for the ls with d 11 7 20 3 table 7 two of the ls lysimeters had a net negative d from water being added to the lysimeter core for adjustments to the lower boundary matric potential fig 6 shows that d was inconsistent with a high degree of variation across lysimeters throughout the measurement period despite the heavier rainfall from doy 227 to 241 a dry spell with minimal precipitation prior to the 120 day study period combined with the strong et resulted in the low total d over the growing season all lysimeters had net positive d whereas in the non growing season when p was lower the majority of lysimeters had water added from the drainage tanks d table 7 to adjust the matric potential at the bottom of the lysimeter to match the field tension variability in d is common for boundary controlled lysimeters due to a combination of the impacts of matric potential automated adjustments and from the variations in soil hydraulic properties of individual lysimeters herbrich et al 2017 groh et al 2018 this was exemplified by the greater spatial variability of d for the ls lysimeters than the sil lysimeters which also could have been due to the mismatch of the ls lysimeter soil type and the soil type of the surrounding field sil groh et al 2016 demonstrated that discrepancies in soil types between lysimeter cores and the location of field tension sensors can cause significant errors in d the σs f tot d in the growing season was similar for both soil types 8 4 mm which suggested that the different soil properties between the ls lysimeters and the surrounding field did not affect the degree of variability when d is positive the δs for the 120 day period was greater for the ls 75 0 21 8 mm than the sil 35 5 14 0 mm fig 7 shows the cumulative p et and δs measured over the 120 day period the cumulative δs in fig 7 reflects the negative total δs for the growing period and the positive δs in the non growing period table 7 all lysimeters experienced a net gain of water by the end of the measurement period soil water content in this region recharges from late winter to early spring mccoy et al 2006 thus conclusions on the effects of crop diversification on δs will require seasonal to annual time scales to be meaningful the δs captures increases in wl from p and decreases from et making the spatial variability in δs and the differences in δs between soil types largely due to et fig 7 shows that δs was similar for both soil types until doy 260 when et became stronger for the sil than the ls causing δs to decrease below that of the ls the δs for the sil remained lower than the ls for the remainder of the measurement period and maintained a greater degree of spatial variability these higher et rates for the sil were in part due to the greater amount of biomass supplemental table s2 but primarily due to the greater water availability the sil has a higher amount of plant available water than the sl zeitoun et al 2021 the soil moisture θ measurements fig s2 supplemental materials showed that the sil contained more moisture at the beginning of the study period and retained higher θ throughout the growing and maturation stages this provided moisture for et during the period of low rainfall from doy 248 to 283 mean weekly p 11 1 mm fig 8 shows the se of the total 120 d cumulative sums of each of the water balance variables according to decreasing number of lysimeters used in the derivation of sums se followed the typical behavior of a decrease with n levy et al 2011 for all water balance variables and for both soil types the decreases in se were fit to a power equation slopes of the fits are presented in table 8 water balance variables with greater σ s f tot table 7 generally had steeper decreases in se with increasing n the slopes were greatest for d and δs β 17 1 and 16 1 driven by the high spatial variability of d between all lysimeters the β for the sil et was greater than that of the ls because of the higher degree of spatial variability observed in this sandier soil changes in se with n were lowest for p for both soil types and only minor differences were observed in se values of average totals using 9 or 8 and 3 lysimeters 1 5 mm thus future comparisons between treatments will require an examination of the inter lysimeter variability prior to pooling treatments particularly when considering d for et since the variability is largely controlled by the degree of plant coverage care should be taken at planting and after establishment to ensure that similar numbers of plants exist on each lysimeter within a treatment group to reduce excessive variability from the smaller sample sizes 4 conclusions uncertainty induced by data processing and data gap filling methods and spatial variability in water balance components derived from soil weighting lysimeters 9 sil and 9 ls were assessed the degree of variation from data processing procedures was evaluated variability from smoothing raw weight signals from wind induced noise was minor a substantial amount of uncertainty in water budget components can be attributed to linear interpolations of missing data filling missing values with data from replicate lysimeters greatly reduced the uncertainty of the water balance sums more sophisticated gap filling techniques should be applied to fill all water balance variables if lysimeters measurements are being evaluated at shorter time scales i e 7 days spatial variability of cumulative sums of water balance components was examined at various time scales over the 120 day measurement period all lysimeters measured p synchronously with a low degree of variation spatial variations over the 120 day measurement period of et and δs were higher than that of p but lower than ranges of variability reported in studies from similar lysimeter facilities within each group of 9 lysimeters the differences in plant cover on individual lysimeters was the main source of variation of et and δs future studies will require close attention to the plant growth in each lysimeter when evaluating the impacts of crop diversification on water balance variables this new high precision

3938,multiphase flow driven by gravity and capillary forces occurs in various applications pertaining to aquifers the vadoze zone and hydrocarbon reservoirs in particular these processes have been under investigation for modeling co2 migration in geosequestration applications solving such multiscale problems can be extremely computationally demanding and therefore upscaling is often employed however a recent study by rabinovich and cheng 2020 showed that implementation of conventional upscaling methods fails to reproduce fine grid simulations of gravity capilary driven flow this work presents a new upscaling method based on an effective property formula for permeability k power law averaging in the capillary limit for relative permeability and an optimization approach for capillary pressure p c the new method is tested on various example cases and coarse grid simulations are shown to match fine grid ones with sufficient accuracy the challenge of upscaling the flows is found to be related to entry pressure trapping and the optimization upscaled p c is shown to have a unique structure allowing to model the trapping the method is global requiring a fine grid simulation for calibration of the optimized parameters however we show that the method reduces computational time dramatically if calibrated parameters are used in cases in which the fine grid solution is unknown such as for varying k realizations keywords upscaling gravity segregation co2 storage capillary heterogeneity entry pressure optimization 1 introduction segregation of two fluid phases under the influence of buoyancy and capillary forces is a phenomenon occurring in a number of natural and man induced subsurface reservoir flows some examples are secondary migration of hydrocarbons enhanced oil recovery by gravity drainage and gas natural gas hydrogen co2 etc storage in aquifers or depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs these applications require accurate flow modeling for planning and monitoring of related projects this is typically done using numerical simulations which can be extremely computationally demanding due to various factors e g large domain size small scale effects requiring a fine mesh subsurface uncertainty requiring stochastic treatment and highly nonlinear governing equations upscaling is a common method which is applied to reduce computational cost yet it has been shown to be challenging for the case of gravity capillary driven flow cheng and rabinovich 2020 this work presents a new method of global upscaling for this type of flow using an optimization algorithm there is a large body of literature detailing numerical and analytical solutions of gravity segregation with capillary pressure influence for example studies related to secondary migration of hydrocarbons lee 1989 shapiro and stenby 1996 bedrikovetsky et al 2001 montel et al 2007 or enhanced oil recovery by gravity drainage hagoort 1980 donato et al 2006 in particular recent literature on this topic has been devoted to applications related to co2 storage in saline aquifers juanes et al 2006 ide et al 2007 bryant et al 2006 hesse and woods 2010 gershenzon et al 2014 gershenzon et al 2015 li and benson 2015 trevisan et al 2017 after co2 is injected into the native brine when injection wells are shut off or during injection far away from the wells viscous forces are negligible and buoyancy influences the co2 to rise towards the top of the aquifer where it remains held by the caprock however a significant portion of the co2 remains trapped in the aquifer depths due to capillary trapping and this is an important process for ensuring long term and safe storage hovorka et al 2004 flett et al 2007 ide et al 2007 han et al 2010 wildenschild et al 2011 deng et al 2012 one of the most significant contributing factors to capillary trapping is capillary heterogeneity i e spatial variation of capillary pressure curves p c s w where s w is wetting phase saturation as a result of changing pore characteristics of the formation this phenomenon also complicates modeling of gravity capillary driven flow as entry pressure considerations become important when the entry pressure of the capillary pressure curves is zero i e p c s w 1 0 the flow solution is easier to achieve and analytical solutions exists for the final equilibrium saturation distribution rabinovich and cheng 2020 e g however when this is not the case co2 in a numerical grid block will not invade a fully brine saturated adjacent block until its capillary pressure exceeds the entry pressure and this complicates the numerical treatment li 2011 hamon et al 2018 it is believed that it also leads to a significant decrease in upscaling accuracy cheng and rabinovich 2020 while there is a large body of literature on multiphase flow upscaling mansoori 1994 christie 2001 durlofsky 2003 only a number of these deal specifically with gravity segregation influenced by capillary effects desbarats 1995 presents an upscaling method for a vertical infiltration problem assuming stratified media braun et al 2005 develop an upscaling approach based on the capillary limit assumption with percolation for layered heterogeneity and apply it to a case of trichlorethylene infiltration into water saturated soil with lenses more recent works with percolation which may be relevant include yang et al 2013 hilden and berg 2016 jackson and krevor 2020 however they focus on lateral migration 2d configurations and reservoirs undergoing injection i e they do not consider 3d gravity segregation mouche et al 2010 and saadatpoor et al 2011 were the first to discuss upscaling in the context of co2 storage the latter recognizing difficulties related to capillary trapping behzadi and alvarado 2012 presented a method for upscaling co2 vertical migration also based on capillary equilibrium and percolation considerations and applied it to 2d random heterogeneity gershenzon et al 2017 develops simple formulae for effective capillary pressure and relative permeability curves based on averaging however it is for a specific fluvial type reservoir with a bimodal distribution of permeability and simulation grids are not coarsened i e it has not been developed and tested as an upscaling method all of the previous studies discussed above are very limited considering only one or two dimensional flow and a simple heterogeneity structure furthermore the testing of upscaled model accuracy are not thorough e g only very few example cases were presented and often only the accuracy of the saturation at a single layer or a specific time step were considered finally the work of behzadi and alvarado 2012 which considered relatively complex random heterogeneity showed a case with significant errors in the equilibrium saturation at the top layer gravity capillary driven flow problems are inherently difficult to upscale due to the no flow boundary conditions and lack of wells conventional permeability k upscaling methods farmer 2002 durlofsky and chen 2012 are generally based on single phase flow simulations altering the boundary conditions and wells of the multiphase flow problem this is not possible for the considered case since it is not clear how to define an equivalent single phase flow problem when viscous forces are not present furthermore relative permeability k r upscaling whether taking the dynamic pickup and sorbie 1996 or steady state virnovsky et al 2004 approach is also usually based on boundary condition or well driven flow applying the dynamic approach to gravity capillary driven flow yields very limited information on the k r and p c curves due to relatively small saturation variations occurring in most grid blocks therefore all of the previous literature adopted a capillary limit cl upscaling assumption together with some form of averaging e g geometric mean and some studies combined this with percolation these upscaling methods have the advantage of being very computationally cheap requiring no numerical simulations however they were found to be inaccurate for many cases cheng and rabinovich 2020 this work is a continuation of the study by cheng and rabinovich 2020 which clearly presented the difficulty in upscaling gravity capillary driven flow in fact they showed that for many cases all the existing p c upscaling methods failed to achieve sufficient accuracy as capillary trapping was underestimated optimization was then used to show that accurate upscaled p c curves of the brooks corey form brooks and corey 1966 can be obtained however cheng and rabinovich 2020 did not implement the upscaled p c curves in a coarse grid simulation but rather used a fine mesh for testing the upscaled properties in these fine grid upscaled simulations k and k r upscaling was not considered furthermore the optimization was only used in a limited manner not fully developed into an upscaling method and lacking thorough testing in this work we present an upscaling method based on optimization for p c curves effective medium theory for k and capillary limit upscaling using power law averaging in the spirit of rabinovich et al 2016 for k r the new method produces upscaled properties which can be used in accurate coarse simulations approximately matching the fine scale saturation distribution various modes of operation are presented each with a different number of optimization parameters leading to different coarse scale solution accuracies and computational times then upscaled p c curves from an example case are applied to coarse grid simulations with different k realizations or anisotropy ratios this implementation of the new upscaling method results in a significant reduction of computational time finally we provide insight on the role of capillary entry pressure trapping in the flow problems considered here and show evidence that this phenomenon is not taken into account properly in the conventional cl upscaling methods the new optimization upscaling is able to accurately model entry pressure trapping due to the structure of the optimized parameters we note that the upscaling considered in this work is only in the darcy scale and pore to darcy scale upscaling das and hassanizadeh 2005 is outside the scope furthermore we aim at calculating upscaled p c curves which can be used in general purpose numerical simulators and therefore they must be sufficiently smooth and monotonic simulators based on vertical equilibrium yortsos 1995 gasda et al 2013 or invasion percolation ioannidis et al 1996 nooruddin and blunt 2018 are therefore also outside the scope of this work the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the flow problem considered in this work section 3 details the new upscaling method for k k r and p c as well as the cl methods used for comparison the different test cases considered in the paper are discussed in section 4 section 5 presents the results for k and k r upscaling while section 6 presents in detail the results for optimization upscaling of p c curves section 7 shows how the new method can be implemented in a practical framework reducing computational cost section 8 is a discussion regarding the entry pressure trapping mechanism impacting the accuracy of the upscaling methods the paper is concluded with a short summary and presentation of main conclusions in section 9 2 description of flow problem we consider flow of two fluids with different densities in a confined porous medium assuming two phase immiscible flow of incompressible fluids and porous material we arrive at the governing system of 1 ϕ s j t k rj μ j k p j ρ j gz 0 where ϕ is the porosity of the rock k rj the relative permeability to phase j j w for wetting phase or j nw for nonwetting phase s j the saturation of phase j μ j the viscosity of phase j p j the pressure of phase j k the absolute permeability tensor ρ j the density of phase j g is gravitational acceleration and z is the vertical coordinate in our cartesian system x y z pressures of the nonwetting and wetting phases are related by 2 p nw p w p c s w where p c s w is the capillary pressure curve saturations are subjected to the constraint s w s nw 1 boundary conditions are no flow on all surrounding boundaries and wells are not present therefore the only driving forces are buoyancy and capillarity the initial condition is a known saturation distribution s w init at time t 0 these conditions can represent injection of a fluid into a reservoir saturated with another fluid once the injection is stopped the two fluids are distributed throughout the reservoir with some initial saturation and this represents the starting point for our problem then the two fluids begin to migrate due to buoyancy and capillary effects until a steady state is reached when the phases are in equilibrium we seek the saturation distribution at every moment in time until equilibrium obtained by solving eqs 1 and 2 with boundary and initial conditions the assumptions leading to these governing equations are considered in a number of applications discussed previously in particular the assumptions have been used in upscaling studies related to co2 storage in aquifers when the co2 is assumed to be in a supercritical state neglecting fluid compressibility dissolution and chemical reactions mouche et al 2010 gasda et al 2013 yang et al 2013 rabinovich et al 2015 the capillary pressure curves are modeled as follows the impact of heterogeneity on p c is implemented using the leverett j function so that 3 p c s w k ϕ α ϕ k j s w where α is a fitting parameter for simplicity isotropic permeability is assumed here so that k is a scalar function in principle anisotropy could be incorporated leading to different p c functions in each direction the j function is taken to be of brooks corey type brooks and corey 1966 given by 4 j s w s w 1 λ where s w s w s wi 1 s wi s wi is the irreducible water saturation and λ is a fitting parameter we note that hysteresis is not taken into account in our model despite that it may play an important role in post injection migration of co2 during imbibition however our focus is on upscaling and hysteresis is outside the scope of this work an important feature of the brooks corey model is the non zero entry pressure i e p c s w 1 0 which leads to an additional process of capillary trapping during dynamic simulations carried out to model migration of the two fluids nonwetting phase in a grid block with small capillary pressure values large k will not penetrate an adjacent fully wetting phase saturated grid block of large entry pressure small k until its capillary pressure exceeds the entry pressure this is a significant process in the considered problem complicating the solution and the upscaling in fact for p c curves without entry pressure eqs 1 3 have a semi analytical solution for equilibrium conditions rabinovich and cheng 2020 relative permeability is taken to be of the form presented in brooks and corey 1966 commonly used in previous literature e g pickup and sorbie 1996 krause et al 2011 al menhali et al 2015 and given by 5a k rw c w s w m w 5b k rnw c nw 1 s w m nw where c w c nw m w m nw are fitting parameters taken to be c w c nw 1 and m w m nw 2 in this work as in previous studies e g virnovsky et al 2004 rabinovich et al 2019 3 upscaling method we consider flow problems in which the fine scale and upscaled models are governed by the same fundamental equations described in the previous section a numerical solution of the system given by eqs 1 2 requires discretization to a mesh at a resolution determined by factors such as geological data and convergence criteria this mesh often leads to extremely long computational times requiring the construction of a new mesh with larger grid blocks which reduces simulation time upscaling is the process of transitioning from a fine mesh i e the original fine grid to a coarser one i e new coarse grid and populating it with the appropriate upscaled properties so that the solution remains accurate the process is depicted in fig 1 for an example case of a 25x25x50 fine grid upscaled to a coarse grid of 5x5x10 each coarse grid block is assigned upscaled properties porosity ϕ permeability k relative permeability k rw and k rnw and capillary pressure p c upscaled porosity is accurately represented by simple arithmetic averaging of the fine scale values i e 6 ϕ l ϕ l 1 n i ϕ i l where n is the total number of fine blocks in coarse block l 1 i n is the index for fine blocks in coarse block l and ϕ i is the porosity in fine block i arithmetic averaging over fine blocks in a coarse block l is denoted by l the other upscaled properties require more sophisticated calculations and the methods are detailed below 3 1 k and k r upscaling as discussed in section 1 conventional methods for k and k r upscaling are difficult to implement in problems of gravity capillary driven flow furthermore these properties are expected to be less influential on the solution since in cases of no capillary entry pressure the equilibrium solution is not dependent at all on k and k r rabinovich and cheng 2020 we therefore take a relatively simple approach for upscaling these properties using the capillary limit assumption and power law averaging nevertheless the method is novel implementing the approach used in rabinovich et al 2016 and rabinovich 2018 for calculating effective properties in an upscaling framework the method is detailed in the following steps first permeability upscaling is carried out by using the formula for effective permeability considering 3d log normally distributed k dagan 1993 given by 7 k l exp 1 n i 1 n y i l 1 σ y 2 l 6 σ y 4 l 72 where y i ln k i is the log permeability in fine block i and σ y 2 l is the variance of y in coarse block l this relationship is approximate however a numerical study by jankovic et al 2017 has shown that for various non multi gaussian three dimensional permeability fields it applies up to σ y 2 4 next a capillary limit approach combining power law averaging is used for k r upscaling first an arbitrary capillary pressure value of p c is chosen assuming the whole domain is in capillary equilibrium the saturation for each fine scale grid block can be calculated by inverting eqs 3 and 4 i e 8 s w i p c k i ϕ i λ 2 p c k i ϕ i λ 2 1 1 p c k i ϕ i λ 2 1 the phase permeability for each fine scale grid block is obtained by substituting these s w i values in eqs 5a b and multiplying by k i i e 9a k w i k i s w i m w 9b k nw i k i 1 s w i m nw then the upscaling is achieved by power law averaging the phase permeability as follows 10 k rj l 1 k l 1 n i 1 n k j i l ω 1 ω where k l is given by eq 7 and k j i l by eqs 8 9 considering fine blocks in coarse block l the power ω in eq 10 is obtained by matching a power law average of the fine scale k with k i e solving the equation 11 1 n i 1 n k i l ω 1 ω k l for each coarse block l each upscaled value given by eq 10 is matched with an average saturation producing a point on the k rj s w curve given by s w l k rj l the steps for obtaining k rj l via eqs 8 9a 9b 10 are repeated for different values of 0 p c adding more points to the k rj s w curves until they are represented with sufficient resolution to be used as input in coarse grid simulations 3 2 p c upscaling capillary pressure upscaling is carried out in a global optimization approach a global fine scale simulation is conducted to obtain the saturation solution at every time step s w i t s where 0 t s m is the time step and m is the total number of time steps we assume upscaled p c functions of the same form as the fine scale ones given by eq 4 i e 12 p c l α l s w 1 λ where α l is the coarse grid block parameter which is optimized to minimize the objective function 13 o j s 1 m l 1 l s nw f t s l s nw c t s l where l l x l y l z is the total number of coarse grid blocks l x l y and l z are the mesh dimensions in each direction s nw f l is the saturation output of the fine grid simulation averaged over coarse grid blocks and s nw c t s l is the output of a coarse grid simulation incorporating upscaled parameters the approach of optimizing α l for each coarse grid block will be referred to as the b opt method implementation requires an optimization algorithm simulating coarse scale solutions repeatedly until the best α l parameters are obtained minimizing eq 13 it was found that additional optimization parameters such as varying λ in eq 12 did not improve the upscaling substantially furthermore taking α l as the optimization parameters is intuitive considering that the entry pressure trapping is believed to be the process most difficult to capture in coarse simulations 3 2 1 horizontal and vertical plane optimization hv opt calculating p c with the b opt method as presented above leads to an optimization problem with a large number of variables i e the same as the number of coarse grid blocks l this is computationally expensive and is most likely not necessary instead of considering a unique entry pressure parameter α l for each coarse block an alternative approach is to allow variation only for different horizontal and vertical planes this leads to a set of 3 parameters for each coarse block α x α y and α z which are constant on y z x z and x y planes respectively the optimization parameter for each coarse grid block is defined as α l α x α y α z and the total number of optimization parameters in this case is only l x l y l z much less than l the new objective function which is minimized in the hv opt approach is given by 14 o j s 1 m r 1 l z s nw f t s c h r s nw c t s h r s 1 m r 1 l x l y s nw f t s c v x r s nw c t s v x r where c stands for averaging a fine mesh into a coarse mesh h r stands for averaging over horizontal plane r 1 r l z and v r stands for averaging over vertical column r 1 r l x l y this objective function expresses our expectation for matching the fine scale simulation on plane averages and not necessarily for each coarse block however it will be shown that the results are not dramatically less accurate than those of the previous section b opt method despite the significant improvement in computational efficiency 3 2 2 horizontal plane optimization h opt an additional optimization approach focuses on capturing the vertical saturation distribution for the flows we consider here most of the fluid movements are in the vertical direction and the accuracy of the horizontal saturation distribution may be less important in such cases the coarse simulation entry pressure parameter α can be considered to vary only in the z direction i e α l in eq 12 is constant on horizontal planes this leads to only l z optimization variables the objective function which we minimize in this case is given by 15 o j s 1 m r 1 l z s nw f t s c h r s nw c t s h r which suggests that we aim to match the fine scale simulation on horizontal plane averages and not necessarily for each coarse block the optimization algorithm used in this work is matlab s fminsearch based on the simplex search method of lagarias et al 1998 it is a non gradient based method and is not guaranteed to converge to a global minimum it was chosen since it can optimize many variables it is simple to operate and able to achieve adequate results with reasonable computational time although the optimization procedure is sensitive to the initial guess of parameters which can result in different sets of optimized values the objective function converges to similar small values and the overall variation of the parameters in space remains somewhat consistent therefore the final outcome of the coarse scale simulations is not significantly dependent on the initial guess this will be discussed further in section 8 3 2 3 comparison methods in order to assess the performance of the optimization upscaling methods we will hold comparisons with two existing methods capillary limit cl and cl with percolation the cl method simply entails matching the average cl saturation obtained by averaging eq 8 over coarse blocks s w l with the chosen uniform capillary pressure p c scanning different values of p c produces the upscaled cl curve for each coarse block to examine the impact of percolation considerations we implemented the following extension to the cl method during calculation of fine block saturation using eq 8 we test whether each block i has a connected pathway with the initial saturation i e any block i not connected to a block in which s w init 1 is given a value of s w 1 a connected pathway is defined by a sequence of adjacent blocks with s w 1 therefore we first develop an algorithm to find all connected blocks in our domain for each choice of p c we find all connected structures and determine whether they have a connection to blocks with initial saturation i e cells with s w init 1 if they do not then all blocks in the structure will remain with s w 1 otherwise they will be given the cl saturation values from eq 8 4 example cases the upscaling methods discussed above will be applied to various test cases pertaining to different permeability distributions and initial conditions all cases used in this work are summarized in table 1 fine scale numerical simulations are conducted on domains of 25 25 50 and coarse scale mesh is 5 5 10 i e an upscaling factor of 5 thus n 125 and l 250 in section 3 lognormal permeability fields are generated using sequential gaussian simulation clayton and journel 1992 pyrcz and deutsch 2014 with an arithmetic mean of k 100 md and a log permeability variance of σ y 2 3 dimensionless correlation length is taken to be l x 0 1 l y 0 1 and l z 0 1 in the x y and z directions non dimensionalized by the domain length in the corresponding direction an additional case of statistically anisotropic permeability is tested consisting of l x l y 0 2 and l z 0 05 the capillary pressure structure is kept the same in all cases with parameters α 1 kpa md and λ 4 in eqs 3 and 4 respectively the fluids considered in the example cases are water and co2 in a supercritical state pertaining to applications of co2 storage a constant porosity of ϕ 0 25 was used phase densities are ρ w 1037 8 kg m3 and ρ co 2 103 78 kg m3 and viscosity ratio is μ w μ co 2 12 the initial saturation distribution is obtained by simulating injection via a source located in a single grid block at either the top or bottom of the domain referred to as top or bottom injection respectively injection is stopped after different time periods and therefore cases with different initial average saturations s co 2 init are seen in table 1 fig 2 presents the saturation distribution in a vertical slice at the center of the domain for bottom injection with s co 2 init 0 1 case 1 and fig 3 shows the horizontally averaged saturation from top layer 1 to bottom layer 10 of the domain for all cases starting with each initial saturation gravity capillary simulations are carried out with closed boundaries until the fluids are static arriving at equilibrium the solution to case 1 is presented in fig 4 showing horizontally averaged saturation variation from top to bottom of the domain at different times it can be seen that co2 rises to the top and water sinks to the bottom with time until steady state is reached when the fluids are in equilibrium the equilibrium saturation profile shows significant capillary trapping of co2 with 54 of the co2 remaining in the bottom 60 of the domain layers 21 50 we employ the analytical solution from rabinovich and cheng 2020 to test the amount of trapping at the bottom 60 of the domain when capillary entry trapping is excluded from the model we find that there is no co2 remaining in the bottom 60 of the domain for the analytical solution the conclusion is that almost all of the trapped co2 is a result of entry pressure trapping i e isolated co2 completely surrounded by a fully water saturated region 5 results k and k r upscaling we first evaluate upscaling methods of permeability and relative permeability in order to explain and justify the chosen method described in section 3 1 in this stage of the investigation p c is upscaled using the cl method as described in section 3 2 3 fig 5 presents results for horizontally averaged saturation as a function of layer number at 3 times t 100 t 0 02 and t 0 01 days considering case 1 the first time fig 5a is the equilibrium solution the second fig 5b will be referred to as transient 2 and the last fig 5c is transient 1 the fine grid solution is compared with coarse scale solutions in which k is upscaled using different methods arithmetic average k a harmonic average k h and k ef given by eq 7 relative permeability is not upscaled so that the coarse and fine simulations both have uniform k r curves given by eqs 5a b with m w m co 2 2 it is clear that the equilibrium solution is not dependent on k directly and therefore all different upscaling methods considered lead to the same result in fig 5a furthermore the upscaling is clearly not accurate as the coarse scale saturation fails to match the fine grid solution in the two transient cases figs 5b c k upscaling is seen to have an impact and k ef matches the fine grid solution significantly better than the other methods using k ef for upscaling is rather intuitive as it becomes an accurate solution when the domain scale is much larger than the heterogeneity scale we therefore continue from here on by using eq 7 for permeability upscaling in order to test whether it is worthwhile to use an optimization approach for k r upscaling we consider optimizing the parameters m w and m co 2 in each coarse grid block to match the fine scale saturation distributing we implement the horizontal plane optimization h opt so that each horizontal layer has the same k r parameters and the objective function is given by eq 15 using equilibrium transient 1 and transient 2 as the optimization times we have m 3 and l z 10 in eq 15 and overall 20 variables for optimization we also test a simpler optimization in which we assume m w m co 2 leading to 10 optimization variables only the results are presented in fig 6 where it can be seen that the equilibrium upscaled results have an excellent match with the fine grid results however the transient results have a large error in fact the transient saturation nearly coincides with the initial one i e it appears that the segregation occurs much later for the coarse grid simulations when k r is upscaled using optimization there is no significant difference in the results when applying the optimization using 10 or 20 variables altogether we were not able to obtain a reasonable match for both equilibrium and transient results using k r optimization upscaling this is in line with our expectation that the coarse simulations should be somewhat less sensitive to k r upscaling compared to p c upscaling since the source of the co2 trapping is in fact capillary pressure related the conclusion from the tests presented in this section is that we can suffice with a simple approach for k and k r upscaling and focus on p c upscaling using optimization from here on k will be upscaled using eq 7 and k r using the cl power law method as described in section 3 1 6 results capillary pressure upscaling in this section we present and discuss the results for coarse grid simulations applying optimization upscaling to p c case1 is considered first since it is a difficult case to upscale exhibiting significant capillary entry pressure trapping as discussed previously all three optimization methods are applied hv opt section 3 2 1 consisting of 20 variables h opt section 3 2 2 consisting of 10 variables and block optimization b opt given by eq 13 consisting of 250 variables results are presented in figs 7 and 8 for horizontally and vertically averaged saturation respectively for comparison the fine scale and cl upscaling results are also plotted fig 7 shows large errors for cl upscaling as the co2 trapping at equilibrium conditions fig 7a is underestimated leading to more than twice as much co2 at the top layer than the fine scale saturation at transient 1 and 2 conditions fig 7c and b respectively cl upscaling results show a more reasonable match to the fine scale results however a significant difference is still apparent in particular for the transient 2 time all three optimization upscaling methods are seen to produce similar results in fig 7 matching the fine scale with sufficient accuracy the error for each upscaling method corresponding to fig 7 is calculated for each time state t s by the following formula 16 e h 1 l z r 1 l z s co 2 f t s c h r s co 2 c t s h r and the results are presented in table 2 we note that the error e h is similar to the objective function of the h opt method in eq 15 however it is defined here for a certain time state we apply eq 16 to calculate the error associated with horizontally averaged saturation for all the methods the smallest error for all three times is seen to be associated with h opt as the variables and objective function in this method are tailored to obtain the best match for layer average saturation however the errors for the two other optimization methods hv opt and b opt are not much larger the cl method on the other hand is seen to have an error at equilibrium which is larger by an order of magnitude in comparison the optimization methods fig 8 shows results for the different upscaling methods in terms of vertically averaged saturation time variation is seen to be less dramatic since most of the co2 migration is in the vertical and not the horizontal direction nevertheless a mismatch from the fine scale solution is seen for the cl and h opt upscaling results the former is in agreement with previous results for horizontal averages however the h opt results were accurate previously this is again due to the optimization variables used in the h opt which are constant on horizontal planes and are designed to capture the vertical co2 migration only the hv opt and b opt methods are seen to have a much better match to the fine scale results the time averaged error is presented in table 3 considering three different error calculation methods horizontal layer error given by eq 16 averaging the rows of table 2 vertical plane average error given by 17 e v 1 2 ml y s 1 m r 1 l y s co 2 f t s c v x r s co 2 c t s v x r 1 2 ml x s 1 m r 1 l x s co 2 f t s c v y r s co 2 c t s v y r and block error given by 18 e b 1 ml s 1 m l 1 l s nw f t s l s nw c t s l we note that m 3 l x l y 5 l z 10 and l 250 in the above equations table 3 shows once again that error for horizontally averaged saturation is smallest with the h opt method however the same method leads to the largest errors in the vertically averaged and block saturations the former presenting errors even larger than cl upscaling for block errors we find that the b opt has the smallest error and for vertical plane errors both hv opt and b opt present the smallest errors altogether the b opt method appears to be the best upscaling method for matching the fine scale solution however it is not practical in terms of computational time optimizing the 250 variables of this method took approximately 69 h of computer time using a single intel i7 8700 cpu with maximum clock speed of 3 2 ghz on the other hand the h opt and hv opt methods had reasonable computational times of 30 and 50 min respectively we therefore use the hv opt approach from here on since it is shown to achieve sufficient accuracy with reasonable computational time previous literature suggested using variations of the cl upscaling method combined with percolation considerations to check the applicability of such a method we calculated p c using the percolation cl method described in section 3 2 3 and tested the upscaling on coarse grid simulations we found that the results were very similar to the cl results presented in figs 7 and 8 nearly coinciding with the cl curves despite the fact that the p c were altered when percolation was introduced the change did not significantly alter the saturation distribution and this result is consistent with our findings in cheng and rabinovich 2020 we believe that the significant impact which was observed in previous literature was due to the 1d and 2d flows considered which allows much less connected pathways in comparison to the 3d flow in this work we continue to investigate upscaling of various different cases cases2 7 in table 1 and to test the hv opt method fig 9 presents average co2 vertical profiles for cases 3 5 of top injection at equilibrium time each case has a different initial co2 distribution as plotted in fig 3 it is apparent that when the initial saturation is sufficiently large as in figs 9b and c the cl upscaling is accurate and an excellent match between coarse and fine scale solutions can be seen as the saturation is reduced cl upscaling accuracy decreases figs 9b and c and for the smallest saturation tested case2 fig 10 a the largest discrepancy is seen the optimization upscaling results also plotted in fig 9 match fine scale results in all three cases showing that the optimization approach is applicable even when conventional cl upscaling is accurate of course the latter upscaling method is preferable when applicable due to its simplicity and efficiency fig 10 presents the results for case2 consisting of a relatively small amount of co2 injected at the top of the domain the hv opt is applied and the coarse simulation results are seen to be very accurate for equilibrium and transient 2 times in particular an improvement in comparison to the cl upscaling is seen for these times as the latter method shows no equilibrium co2 trapped in the lowest layers for transient 1 fig 10c however hv opt upscaling is less accurate than the cl method this is caused by an asymmetry in the objective function eq 14 which applies more weight to the late times and thus the equilibrium and transient 2 errors are very small at the expense of the transient 1 time improved results can be obtained by adding weights to the objective function so that the transient 1 results will improve at the expense of the later time results we do not present these results as we feel they are not necessary considering the sufficient accuracy achieved even for hv opt upscaling in fig 10c this is supported by the overall errors presented in table 4 for case2 showing comparable values to those of case1 table 3 and significantly smaller errors than the cl upscaling table 4 also presents errors for cases3 5 in which initial saturation is obtained from top injection considering the hv opt upscaling errors are always smaller or similar to those of the cl method indicating the advantage of optimization upscaling two additional bottom injection cases were tested consisting of different initial saturation distribution cases6 and 7 the results are consistent with those of case1 showing good agreement with the fine scale solution and significantly smaller errors in comparison to the cl method the final case considered consists of the same initial saturation as case1 but with an anisotropic permeability distribution fig 11 presents the results where it is seen that the trapping increases in comparison to case1 fig 7 and therefore the cl upscaling is even more inaccurate with overall error of 0 0742 the anisotropy in this case consists of horizontally elongated structures and these are responsible for more entry pressure trapping the coarse scale results with hv opt upscaling are seen to match the fine scale results and the accuracy is particularly impressive when compared to the poor accuracy of cl upscaling overall errors for case8 presented in table 4 are sufficiently small and much smaller than the cl errors 7 applicability of optimization upscaling the results of the previous section established that the optimization upscaling using the hv method is sufficiently accurate for a wide variety of cases however the upscaled parameters α l in eq 12 are obtained in a calibration type optimization procedure using the fine grid simulation results therefore there is no reduction of computational time but rather an added time associated with the optimization saving computational cost is possible if these parameters can be applied to other cases of interest for example it is common to simulate flow in subsurface formations considering different realizations of the permeability field we now use the optimized upscaled capillary pressure parameters from case1 in simulations with different k realizations consisting of the same statistical characteristics k 100 md σ y 2 3 and l x l y l z 0 1 upscaling k and k r is conducted for each realization separately however these are rapid calculations with negligible computational cost coarse grid simulations with the α l parameters from case1 were conducted for 10 realizations and the results are compared with the corresponding fine grid simulations fig 12 presents results for two realizations realization 1 figs 12c and realization 2 figs 12d f at the three time states transient 1 transient 2 and equilibrium it can be seen that despite having the same statistical properties saturation profiles are different between realization 1 and realization 2 and also different than case1 see fig 7 realization 1 was chosen as it was found to have the best match between coarse and fine grid simulations and indeed a very good match is seen between the two in figs 12a c realization 2 was found to have the worst match of the 10 realizations and yet figs 12d f show that the match is quite good in particular for the equilibrium time furthermore the alternative of using cl upscaling would lead to an extremely large mismatch for each realization at equilibrium and late times since no trapping would be obtained in the lower layers as seen in fig 7 fig 13 presents results for all 10 realizations showing the coarse and fine grid simulation saturation profiles as well as the ensemble averages for each it can be seen that the ensemble averages of the coarse and fine grid simulations are in general agreement and accuracy appears to be similar to that of realization 1 in fig 12 a similar analysis was also carried out for case8 considering different realizations of statistically anisotropic permeability l x l y 0 2 and l z 0 05 the α l parameters from case8 were used in coarse grid simulations of 10 realizations and the results are plotted in fig 14 the plots show satisfactory agreement between the coarse and fine scale results indicating that the upscaling is able to capture the trapping in the anisotropic case as well overall using calibrated p c parameters from one realization for simulations of many other realizations is found to be applicable in terms of computational efficiency a coarse grid simulation took 10 15 s to carry out while a fine grid simulation took around 50 min a speedup factor of 200 300 therefore to conduct 10 simulations takes over 8 h using fine grid simulations while less than 2 h are required using the optimization upscaling method 50 min for a single fine grid simulation 50 min for optimization and 2 min for coarse grid simulations of course the computational reduction becomes even more significant as the number of simulations increases since the upscaling approach will remain around 2 h while the fine scale times increase linearly with the number of runs considering that hundreds of realizations are often used for uncertainty quantification this upscaling approach would result in a dramatic reduction of computational cost an additional proof of applicability of the optimization upscaling is presented in figs 15 and 16 the calibrated α l parameters from case1 are used in coarse grid simulations with permeability realizations characterized by the statistics of case8 i e isotropic k optimization parameters are implemented in simulations of anisotropic realizations results for two realizations best and worst cases are presented in fig 14 where it can be seen that there is a reasonable match between coarse and fine scale saturation profiles comparing this figure with fig 12 it is apparent that the match is not as good as for the latter case fig 16 presents the ensemble average comparison showing a reasonable agreement between coarse and fine scale results once again the match is not as accurate in comparison to the previous tests presented in figs 13 and 14 this is due to the impact of anisotropy on entry pressure trapping increasing the phenomenon in comparison to the isotropic cases thus using the isotropic α l parameters in anisotropic simulations leads to an underestimation of co2 trapping in the lower parts of the domain and therefore more co2 in the upper part of the domain this is observed consistently in figs 15 and 16 nevertheless the approach is believed to be applicable considering the alternative of cl upscaling which for these simulations at equilibrium and late times would result in no co2 trapping in the lower layers and therefore a very large mismatch between coarse and fine scale results 8 discussion problems of multiphase flow are known to be characterized by the capillary and gravity numbers representing the interplay between viscous gravity and capillary forces for problems of gravity segregation with capillary heterogeneity that are considered here only the gravity and capillary forces are significant and therefore the bond number is usually used for characterization following rabinovich and cheng 2020 we define the bond number as 19 n b α k δ ρ gh 2 where δ ρ ρ w ρ co 2 and h is the domain height substituting the problem parameters for the cases considered here shows that the bond number is the same for all 8 case i e n b 75 and this value corresponds to the second case considered in rabinovich and cheng 2020 see figs 9 cd therein which showed both capillary and gravity effects i e an intermediate bond number the accuracy of upscaling methods is expected to be closely related to the bond number for small n b gravity forces dominate and the problem is relatively simple to solve upscaling using any approach should lead to accurate coarse grid simulations for large n b capillary forces dominate and cl upscaling is expected to be accurate intermediate values of n b are most difficult to solve and to upscale however it was shown that even for intermediate n b values when there is no entry pressure in capillary pressure curves an analytical solution exists for equilibrium conditions and upscaling can be achieved with a simple approach such as cl this work focuses on challenging cases and therefore all cases considered had an intermediate n b value as well as entry pressure trapping nevertheless we still find a significant difference in the cl applicability despite having intermediate n b values and entry pressure for all 8 cases this was found to be related to the extent of capillary entry pressure trapping occurring as discussed below for each case we estimate the amount of trapping which is a result of entry pressure considerations this is carried out by comparing the fine grid equilibrium simulation results to the analytical solution of rabinovich and cheng 2020 which does not incorporate entry pressure trapping for a detailed description of entry pressure trapping mechanism and the derivation of the analytical solution we refer the reader to rabinovich and cheng 2020 moreno and rabinovich 2021 entry pressure trapping is therefore quantified as s co 2 f s co 2 an s co 2 where s co 2 an is the analytical solution for equilibrium conditions and s co 2 is the overall average saturation which is the same for both solutions when the simulation includes very little entry pressure trapping the saturation solution will be close to the analytical one and this quantity will approach zero as the entry pressure trapping increases the saturation solution will depart from the analytical one and the defined quantity will increase fig 17 depicts the overall upscaling error for cases1 8 given by eq 16 normalized by s co 2 as a function of the entry pressure trapping defined above it can be clearly seen that the error of the cl upscaling method increases when capillary entry pressure trapping is increased this supports our conjuncture that the reason for large errors in coarse grid simulations is the inability to accurately model entry pressure trapping this type of trapping is almost completely absent from the coarse simulations as seen in figs 7a and 11a in which the cl upscaling shows no co2 at the bottom half of the domain the upscaling error for the optimization method on the other hand is seen to increase slightly for small entry pressure trapping values and then level off to a constant reasonable error as trapping increases it is therefore concluded that the coarse grid simulations with hv opt upscaling are able to model the entry pressure trapping leading to a significantly better agreement with fine grid simulations entry pressure trapping occurs during the transient stage of the fluid segregation when regions with co2 find themselves surrounded by a fully water saturated shell region which blocks the co2 movement trapping it in place therefore it is intuitive that cases with less initial co2 will generally have more entry pressure trapping as there is more opportunity for fully water saturated regions to exist indeed the points in fig 17 are ordered from the smallest s co 2 case6 having the largest value of entry pressure trapping to the largest s co 2 case5 having the least trapping the exception to this rule is case8 which due to anisotropy has increased trapping and this is observed comparing with case1 furthermore top injection s w init distribution is expected to generally have less entry pressure trapping than bottom injection since the latter case has more opportunity for co2 to find itself surrounded by water regions as it migrates towards the top of the domain indeed the cases with top injection cases2 5 have the smallest values of entry pressure trapping although this appears to be a less significant factor compared to s co 2 discussed previously to gain some understanding regarding the improved accuracy of the optimization method we investigate the calibrated parameters α l from eq 12 fig 18 presents these parameters obtained by applying the optimization of the h opt method i e α l varies only by layer it can be seen that the parameter values depend on the initial guess of α l used as input in the optimization algorithm i e different initial guesses lead to a different α l result despite a similar small value of the objective function eq 15 this indicates that the optimization converges to local minima rather than a global one as common in complex many variable problems the initial guess taken in all optimization methods consisted of constant α l with values ranging between 5 15 despite the different parameter values it is apparent that the curves in fig 18 have a similar trend i e the α l variation is similar in structure this structure is what allows modelling the capillary entry pressure trapping and thus the high accuracy of the method parameters α l are in fact the entry pressure for each layer it can be seen that the maximum in entry pressure is consistently at the top of the domain around layers 2 3 and this is responsible for delaying the co2 migration to the top and ultimately increasing the trapping at the lower layers when observing in more detail it can be seen that there are two maxima at layers 2 3 and 7 followed by two minima near layers 5 and 9 these correspond to the two maxima in co2 observed in fig 18 thus the minima in entry pressure seen at layers 5 and 9 act as trapping zones for co2 and allow to enhance overall trapping which is typically grossly underestimated in coarse grid simulations 9 summary and conclusions this work presented a new upscaling method based on an effective property formula for k power law averaging in the capillary limit for k r and an optimization approach for p c the method was developed for upscaling flow driven by gravity and capillary forces i e gravity segregation of two fluids subjected to capillary heterogeneity effects the new method is applied to 8 example cases with different initial fluid distributions and permeability fields we show that the new upscaling method leads to coarse grid simulations that match the fine scale results with sufficient accuracy the optimization upscaling approach can be implemented in various techniques consisting of different numbers of calibration parameters three such methods were presented and evaluated horizontal plane optimization h opt horizontal and vertical plane optimization hv opt and block optimization b opt the hv opt method was shown to optimally balance between accuracy and computational efficiency the new method is able to accurately match fine grid simulation results for horizontally averaged and vertically averaged saturation these accuracies are significantly higher than those of the conventional cl method which is shown to underestimate the lighter phase saturation at the lower regions of the domain we demonstrate that the reason for this underestimation and the overall inaccuracy of the cl upscaling is related to the mechanism of entry pressure trapping therefore the success of the optimization upscaling is related to the entry pressure structure of the upscaled p c curve which promotes trapping the new upscaling method is implemented in a global approach i e a fine grid simulation is required for the calibration of the upscaled parameters this type of upscaling usually serves as a stepping stone towards more efficient local upscaling methods nevertheless the current method is shown to be applicable in a stochastic framework in which many simulations are carried out for different k realizations constrained to certain stochastic characteristics the optimized p c parameters from one realization of lognormal k distribution with given mean and variance of log k were used in simulations of many other realizations the results showed sufficient accuracy of the coarse scale results in comparison to the fine scale ones furthermore even considering realizations with changing anisotropy ratio reasonable accuracy was found although less than the cases in which the calibrated k and the additional realizations consisted of the same anisotropy ratio overall we believe that the new method is applicable to realistic cases of gravity capillary driven flow simulations it also may serve as a preliminary step towards developing similar yet more efficient methods in general upscaling methods based on optimization or machine learning algorithms should be further explored as conventional methods have been found to be inaccurate for many flow scenarios such as those presented in this work credit authorship contribution statement kan bun cheng conceptualization software formal analysis validation writing

3938,multiphase flow driven by gravity and capillary forces occurs in various applications pertaining to aquifers the vadoze zone and hydrocarbon reservoirs in particular these processes have been under investigation for modeling co2 migration in geosequestration applications solving such multiscale problems can be extremely computationally demanding and therefore upscaling is often employed however a recent study by rabinovich and cheng 2020 showed that implementation of conventional upscaling methods fails to reproduce fine grid simulations of gravity capilary driven flow this work presents a new upscaling method based on an effective property formula for permeability k power law averaging in the capillary limit for relative permeability and an optimization approach for capillary pressure p c the new method is tested on various example cases and coarse grid simulations are shown to match fine grid ones with sufficient accuracy the challenge of upscaling the flows is found to be related to entry pressure trapping and the optimization upscaled p c is shown to have a unique structure allowing to model the trapping the method is global requiring a fine grid simulation for calibration of the optimized parameters however we show that the method reduces computational time dramatically if calibrated parameters are used in cases in which the fine grid solution is unknown such as for varying k realizations keywords upscaling gravity segregation co2 storage capillary heterogeneity entry pressure optimization 1 introduction segregation of two fluid phases under the influence of buoyancy and capillary forces is a phenomenon occurring in a number of natural and man induced subsurface reservoir flows some examples are secondary migration of hydrocarbons enhanced oil recovery by gravity drainage and gas natural gas hydrogen co2 etc storage in aquifers or depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs these applications require accurate flow modeling for planning and monitoring of related projects this is typically done using numerical simulations which can be extremely computationally demanding due to various factors e g large domain size small scale effects requiring a fine mesh subsurface uncertainty requiring stochastic treatment and highly nonlinear governing equations upscaling is a common method which is applied to reduce computational cost yet it has been shown to be challenging for the case of gravity capillary driven flow cheng and rabinovich 2020 this work presents a new method of global upscaling for this type of flow using an optimization algorithm there is a large body of literature detailing numerical and analytical solutions of gravity segregation with capillary pressure influence for example studies related to secondary migration of hydrocarbons lee 1989 shapiro and stenby 1996 bedrikovetsky et al 2001 montel et al 2007 or enhanced oil recovery by gravity drainage hagoort 1980 donato et al 2006 in particular recent literature on this topic has been devoted to applications related to co2 storage in saline aquifers juanes et al 2006 ide et al 2007 bryant et al 2006 hesse and woods 2010 gershenzon et al 2014 gershenzon et al 2015 li and benson 2015 trevisan et al 2017 after co2 is injected into the native brine when injection wells are shut off or during injection far away from the wells viscous forces are negligible and buoyancy influences the co2 to rise towards the top of the aquifer where it remains held by the caprock however a significant portion of the co2 remains trapped in the aquifer depths due to capillary trapping and this is an important process for ensuring long term and safe storage hovorka et al 2004 flett et al 2007 ide et al 2007 han et al 2010 wildenschild et al 2011 deng et al 2012 one of the most significant contributing factors to capillary trapping is capillary heterogeneity i e spatial variation of capillary pressure curves p c s w where s w is wetting phase saturation as a result of changing pore characteristics of the formation this phenomenon also complicates modeling of gravity capillary driven flow as entry pressure considerations become important when the entry pressure of the capillary pressure curves is zero i e p c s w 1 0 the flow solution is easier to achieve and analytical solutions exists for the final equilibrium saturation distribution rabinovich and cheng 2020 e g however when this is not the case co2 in a numerical grid block will not invade a fully brine saturated adjacent block until its capillary pressure exceeds the entry pressure and this complicates the numerical treatment li 2011 hamon et al 2018 it is believed that it also leads to a significant decrease in upscaling accuracy cheng and rabinovich 2020 while there is a large body of literature on multiphase flow upscaling mansoori 1994 christie 2001 durlofsky 2003 only a number of these deal specifically with gravity segregation influenced by capillary effects desbarats 1995 presents an upscaling method for a vertical infiltration problem assuming stratified media braun et al 2005 develop an upscaling approach based on the capillary limit assumption with percolation for layered heterogeneity and apply it to a case of trichlorethylene infiltration into water saturated soil with lenses more recent works with percolation which may be relevant include yang et al 2013 hilden and berg 2016 jackson and krevor 2020 however they focus on lateral migration 2d configurations and reservoirs undergoing injection i e they do not consider 3d gravity segregation mouche et al 2010 and saadatpoor et al 2011 were the first to discuss upscaling in the context of co2 storage the latter recognizing difficulties related to capillary trapping behzadi and alvarado 2012 presented a method for upscaling co2 vertical migration also based on capillary equilibrium and percolation considerations and applied it to 2d random heterogeneity gershenzon et al 2017 develops simple formulae for effective capillary pressure and relative permeability curves based on averaging however it is for a specific fluvial type reservoir with a bimodal distribution of permeability and simulation grids are not coarsened i e it has not been developed and tested as an upscaling method all of the previous studies discussed above are very limited considering only one or two dimensional flow and a simple heterogeneity structure furthermore the testing of upscaled model accuracy are not thorough e g only very few example cases were presented and often only the accuracy of the saturation at a single layer or a specific time step were considered finally the work of behzadi and alvarado 2012 which considered relatively complex random heterogeneity showed a case with significant errors in the equilibrium saturation at the top layer gravity capillary driven flow problems are inherently difficult to upscale due to the no flow boundary conditions and lack of wells conventional permeability k upscaling methods farmer 2002 durlofsky and chen 2012 are generally based on single phase flow simulations altering the boundary conditions and wells of the multiphase flow problem this is not possible for the considered case since it is not clear how to define an equivalent single phase flow problem when viscous forces are not present furthermore relative permeability k r upscaling whether taking the dynamic pickup and sorbie 1996 or steady state virnovsky et al 2004 approach is also usually based on boundary condition or well driven flow applying the dynamic approach to gravity capillary driven flow yields very limited information on the k r and p c curves due to relatively small saturation variations occurring in most grid blocks therefore all of the previous literature adopted a capillary limit cl upscaling assumption together with some form of averaging e g geometric mean and some studies combined this with percolation these upscaling methods have the advantage of being very computationally cheap requiring no numerical simulations however they were found to be inaccurate for many cases cheng and rabinovich 2020 this work is a continuation of the study by cheng and rabinovich 2020 which clearly presented the difficulty in upscaling gravity capillary driven flow in fact they showed that for many cases all the existing p c upscaling methods failed to achieve sufficient accuracy as capillary trapping was underestimated optimization was then used to show that accurate upscaled p c curves of the brooks corey form brooks and corey 1966 can be obtained however cheng and rabinovich 2020 did not implement the upscaled p c curves in a coarse grid simulation but rather used a fine mesh for testing the upscaled properties in these fine grid upscaled simulations k and k r upscaling was not considered furthermore the optimization was only used in a limited manner not fully developed into an upscaling method and lacking thorough testing in this work we present an upscaling method based on optimization for p c curves effective medium theory for k and capillary limit upscaling using power law averaging in the spirit of rabinovich et al 2016 for k r the new method produces upscaled properties which can be used in accurate coarse simulations approximately matching the fine scale saturation distribution various modes of operation are presented each with a different number of optimization parameters leading to different coarse scale solution accuracies and computational times then upscaled p c curves from an example case are applied to coarse grid simulations with different k realizations or anisotropy ratios this implementation of the new upscaling method results in a significant reduction of computational time finally we provide insight on the role of capillary entry pressure trapping in the flow problems considered here and show evidence that this phenomenon is not taken into account properly in the conventional cl upscaling methods the new optimization upscaling is able to accurately model entry pressure trapping due to the structure of the optimized parameters we note that the upscaling considered in this work is only in the darcy scale and pore to darcy scale upscaling das and hassanizadeh 2005 is outside the scope furthermore we aim at calculating upscaled p c curves which can be used in general purpose numerical simulators and therefore they must be sufficiently smooth and monotonic simulators based on vertical equilibrium yortsos 1995 gasda et al 2013 or invasion percolation ioannidis et al 1996 nooruddin and blunt 2018 are therefore also outside the scope of this work the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the flow problem considered in this work section 3 details the new upscaling method for k k r and p c as well as the cl methods used for comparison the different test cases considered in the paper are discussed in section 4 section 5 presents the results for k and k r upscaling while section 6 presents in detail the results for optimization upscaling of p c curves section 7 shows how the new method can be implemented in a practical framework reducing computational cost section 8 is a discussion regarding the entry pressure trapping mechanism impacting the accuracy of the upscaling methods the paper is concluded with a short summary and presentation of main conclusions in section 9 2 description of flow problem we consider flow of two fluids with different densities in a confined porous medium assuming two phase immiscible flow of incompressible fluids and porous material we arrive at the governing system of 1 ϕ s j t k rj μ j k p j ρ j gz 0 where ϕ is the porosity of the rock k rj the relative permeability to phase j j w for wetting phase or j nw for nonwetting phase s j the saturation of phase j μ j the viscosity of phase j p j the pressure of phase j k the absolute permeability tensor ρ j the density of phase j g is gravitational acceleration and z is the vertical coordinate in our cartesian system x y z pressures of the nonwetting and wetting phases are related by 2 p nw p w p c s w where p c s w is the capillary pressure curve saturations are subjected to the constraint s w s nw 1 boundary conditions are no flow on all surrounding boundaries and wells are not present therefore the only driving forces are buoyancy and capillarity the initial condition is a known saturation distribution s w init at time t 0 these conditions can represent injection of a fluid into a reservoir saturated with another fluid once the injection is stopped the two fluids are distributed throughout the reservoir with some initial saturation and this represents the starting point for our problem then the two fluids begin to migrate due to buoyancy and capillary effects until a steady state is reached when the phases are in equilibrium we seek the saturation distribution at every moment in time until equilibrium obtained by solving eqs 1 and 2 with boundary and initial conditions the assumptions leading to these governing equations are considered in a number of applications discussed previously in particular the assumptions have been used in upscaling studies related to co2 storage in aquifers when the co2 is assumed to be in a supercritical state neglecting fluid compressibility dissolution and chemical reactions mouche et al 2010 gasda et al 2013 yang et al 2013 rabinovich et al 2015 the capillary pressure curves are modeled as follows the impact of heterogeneity on p c is implemented using the leverett j function so that 3 p c s w k ϕ α ϕ k j s w where α is a fitting parameter for simplicity isotropic permeability is assumed here so that k is a scalar function in principle anisotropy could be incorporated leading to different p c functions in each direction the j function is taken to be of brooks corey type brooks and corey 1966 given by 4 j s w s w 1 λ where s w s w s wi 1 s wi s wi is the irreducible water saturation and λ is a fitting parameter we note that hysteresis is not taken into account in our model despite that it may play an important role in post injection migration of co2 during imbibition however our focus is on upscaling and hysteresis is outside the scope of this work an important feature of the brooks corey model is the non zero entry pressure i e p c s w 1 0 which leads to an additional process of capillary trapping during dynamic simulations carried out to model migration of the two fluids nonwetting phase in a grid block with small capillary pressure values large k will not penetrate an adjacent fully wetting phase saturated grid block of large entry pressure small k until its capillary pressure exceeds the entry pressure this is a significant process in the considered problem complicating the solution and the upscaling in fact for p c curves without entry pressure eqs 1 3 have a semi analytical solution for equilibrium conditions rabinovich and cheng 2020 relative permeability is taken to be of the form presented in brooks and corey 1966 commonly used in previous literature e g pickup and sorbie 1996 krause et al 2011 al menhali et al 2015 and given by 5a k rw c w s w m w 5b k rnw c nw 1 s w m nw where c w c nw m w m nw are fitting parameters taken to be c w c nw 1 and m w m nw 2 in this work as in previous studies e g virnovsky et al 2004 rabinovich et al 2019 3 upscaling method we consider flow problems in which the fine scale and upscaled models are governed by the same fundamental equations described in the previous section a numerical solution of the system given by eqs 1 2 requires discretization to a mesh at a resolution determined by factors such as geological data and convergence criteria this mesh often leads to extremely long computational times requiring the construction of a new mesh with larger grid blocks which reduces simulation time upscaling is the process of transitioning from a fine mesh i e the original fine grid to a coarser one i e new coarse grid and populating it with the appropriate upscaled properties so that the solution remains accurate the process is depicted in fig 1 for an example case of a 25x25x50 fine grid upscaled to a coarse grid of 5x5x10 each coarse grid block is assigned upscaled properties porosity ϕ permeability k relative permeability k rw and k rnw and capillary pressure p c upscaled porosity is accurately represented by simple arithmetic averaging of the fine scale values i e 6 ϕ l ϕ l 1 n i ϕ i l where n is the total number of fine blocks in coarse block l 1 i n is the index for fine blocks in coarse block l and ϕ i is the porosity in fine block i arithmetic averaging over fine blocks in a coarse block l is denoted by l the other upscaled properties require more sophisticated calculations and the methods are detailed below 3 1 k and k r upscaling as discussed in section 1 conventional methods for k and k r upscaling are difficult to implement in problems of gravity capillary driven flow furthermore these properties are expected to be less influential on the solution since in cases of no capillary entry pressure the equilibrium solution is not dependent at all on k and k r rabinovich and cheng 2020 we therefore take a relatively simple approach for upscaling these properties using the capillary limit assumption and power law averaging nevertheless the method is novel implementing the approach used in rabinovich et al 2016 and rabinovich 2018 for calculating effective properties in an upscaling framework the method is detailed in the following steps first permeability upscaling is carried out by using the formula for effective permeability considering 3d log normally distributed k dagan 1993 given by 7 k l exp 1 n i 1 n y i l 1 σ y 2 l 6 σ y 4 l 72 where y i ln k i is the log permeability in fine block i and σ y 2 l is the variance of y in coarse block l this relationship is approximate however a numerical study by jankovic et al 2017 has shown that for various non multi gaussian three dimensional permeability fields it applies up to σ y 2 4 next a capillary limit approach combining power law averaging is used for k r upscaling first an arbitrary capillary pressure value of p c is chosen assuming the whole domain is in capillary equilibrium the saturation for each fine scale grid block can be calculated by inverting eqs 3 and 4 i e 8 s w i p c k i ϕ i λ 2 p c k i ϕ i λ 2 1 1 p c k i ϕ i λ 2 1 the phase permeability for each fine scale grid block is obtained by substituting these s w i values in eqs 5a b and multiplying by k i i e 9a k w i k i s w i m w 9b k nw i k i 1 s w i m nw then the upscaling is achieved by power law averaging the phase permeability as follows 10 k rj l 1 k l 1 n i 1 n k j i l ω 1 ω where k l is given by eq 7 and k j i l by eqs 8 9 considering fine blocks in coarse block l the power ω in eq 10 is obtained by matching a power law average of the fine scale k with k i e solving the equation 11 1 n i 1 n k i l ω 1 ω k l for each coarse block l each upscaled value given by eq 10 is matched with an average saturation producing a point on the k rj s w curve given by s w l k rj l the steps for obtaining k rj l via eqs 8 9a 9b 10 are repeated for different values of 0 p c adding more points to the k rj s w curves until they are represented with sufficient resolution to be used as input in coarse grid simulations 3 2 p c upscaling capillary pressure upscaling is carried out in a global optimization approach a global fine scale simulation is conducted to obtain the saturation solution at every time step s w i t s where 0 t s m is the time step and m is the total number of time steps we assume upscaled p c functions of the same form as the fine scale ones given by eq 4 i e 12 p c l α l s w 1 λ where α l is the coarse grid block parameter which is optimized to minimize the objective function 13 o j s 1 m l 1 l s nw f t s l s nw c t s l where l l x l y l z is the total number of coarse grid blocks l x l y and l z are the mesh dimensions in each direction s nw f l is the saturation output of the fine grid simulation averaged over coarse grid blocks and s nw c t s l is the output of a coarse grid simulation incorporating upscaled parameters the approach of optimizing α l for each coarse grid block will be referred to as the b opt method implementation requires an optimization algorithm simulating coarse scale solutions repeatedly until the best α l parameters are obtained minimizing eq 13 it was found that additional optimization parameters such as varying λ in eq 12 did not improve the upscaling substantially furthermore taking α l as the optimization parameters is intuitive considering that the entry pressure trapping is believed to be the process most difficult to capture in coarse simulations 3 2 1 horizontal and vertical plane optimization hv opt calculating p c with the b opt method as presented above leads to an optimization problem with a large number of variables i e the same as the number of coarse grid blocks l this is computationally expensive and is most likely not necessary instead of considering a unique entry pressure parameter α l for each coarse block an alternative approach is to allow variation only for different horizontal and vertical planes this leads to a set of 3 parameters for each coarse block α x α y and α z which are constant on y z x z and x y planes respectively the optimization parameter for each coarse grid block is defined as α l α x α y α z and the total number of optimization parameters in this case is only l x l y l z much less than l the new objective function which is minimized in the hv opt approach is given by 14 o j s 1 m r 1 l z s nw f t s c h r s nw c t s h r s 1 m r 1 l x l y s nw f t s c v x r s nw c t s v x r where c stands for averaging a fine mesh into a coarse mesh h r stands for averaging over horizontal plane r 1 r l z and v r stands for averaging over vertical column r 1 r l x l y this objective function expresses our expectation for matching the fine scale simulation on plane averages and not necessarily for each coarse block however it will be shown that the results are not dramatically less accurate than those of the previous section b opt method despite the significant improvement in computational efficiency 3 2 2 horizontal plane optimization h opt an additional optimization approach focuses on capturing the vertical saturation distribution for the flows we consider here most of the fluid movements are in the vertical direction and the accuracy of the horizontal saturation distribution may be less important in such cases the coarse simulation entry pressure parameter α can be considered to vary only in the z direction i e α l in eq 12 is constant on horizontal planes this leads to only l z optimization variables the objective function which we minimize in this case is given by 15 o j s 1 m r 1 l z s nw f t s c h r s nw c t s h r which suggests that we aim to match the fine scale simulation on horizontal plane averages and not necessarily for each coarse block the optimization algorithm used in this work is matlab s fminsearch based on the simplex search method of lagarias et al 1998 it is a non gradient based method and is not guaranteed to converge to a global minimum it was chosen since it can optimize many variables it is simple to operate and able to achieve adequate results with reasonable computational time although the optimization procedure is sensitive to the initial guess of parameters which can result in different sets of optimized values the objective function converges to similar small values and the overall variation of the parameters in space remains somewhat consistent therefore the final outcome of the coarse scale simulations is not significantly dependent on the initial guess this will be discussed further in section 8 3 2 3 comparison methods in order to assess the performance of the optimization upscaling methods we will hold comparisons with two existing methods capillary limit cl and cl with percolation the cl method simply entails matching the average cl saturation obtained by averaging eq 8 over coarse blocks s w l with the chosen uniform capillary pressure p c scanning different values of p c produces the upscaled cl curve for each coarse block to examine the impact of percolation considerations we implemented the following extension to the cl method during calculation of fine block saturation using eq 8 we test whether each block i has a connected pathway with the initial saturation i e any block i not connected to a block in which s w init 1 is given a value of s w 1 a connected pathway is defined by a sequence of adjacent blocks with s w 1 therefore we first develop an algorithm to find all connected blocks in our domain for each choice of p c we find all connected structures and determine whether they have a connection to blocks with initial saturation i e cells with s w init 1 if they do not then all blocks in the structure will remain with s w 1 otherwise they will be given the cl saturation values from eq 8 4 example cases the upscaling methods discussed above will be applied to various test cases pertaining to different permeability distributions and initial conditions all cases used in this work are summarized in table 1 fine scale numerical simulations are conducted on domains of 25 25 50 and coarse scale mesh is 5 5 10 i e an upscaling factor of 5 thus n 125 and l 250 in section 3 lognormal permeability fields are generated using sequential gaussian simulation clayton and journel 1992 pyrcz and deutsch 2014 with an arithmetic mean of k 100 md and a log permeability variance of σ y 2 3 dimensionless correlation length is taken to be l x 0 1 l y 0 1 and l z 0 1 in the x y and z directions non dimensionalized by the domain length in the corresponding direction an additional case of statistically anisotropic permeability is tested consisting of l x l y 0 2 and l z 0 05 the capillary pressure structure is kept the same in all cases with parameters α 1 kpa md and λ 4 in eqs 3 and 4 respectively the fluids considered in the example cases are water and co2 in a supercritical state pertaining to applications of co2 storage a constant porosity of ϕ 0 25 was used phase densities are ρ w 1037 8 kg m3 and ρ co 2 103 78 kg m3 and viscosity ratio is μ w μ co 2 12 the initial saturation distribution is obtained by simulating injection via a source located in a single grid block at either the top or bottom of the domain referred to as top or bottom injection respectively injection is stopped after different time periods and therefore cases with different initial average saturations s co 2 init are seen in table 1 fig 2 presents the saturation distribution in a vertical slice at the center of the domain for bottom injection with s co 2 init 0 1 case 1 and fig 3 shows the horizontally averaged saturation from top layer 1 to bottom layer 10 of the domain for all cases starting with each initial saturation gravity capillary simulations are carried out with closed boundaries until the fluids are static arriving at equilibrium the solution to case 1 is presented in fig 4 showing horizontally averaged saturation variation from top to bottom of the domain at different times it can be seen that co2 rises to the top and water sinks to the bottom with time until steady state is reached when the fluids are in equilibrium the equilibrium saturation profile shows significant capillary trapping of co2 with 54 of the co2 remaining in the bottom 60 of the domain layers 21 50 we employ the analytical solution from rabinovich and cheng 2020 to test the amount of trapping at the bottom 60 of the domain when capillary entry trapping is excluded from the model we find that there is no co2 remaining in the bottom 60 of the domain for the analytical solution the conclusion is that almost all of the trapped co2 is a result of entry pressure trapping i e isolated co2 completely surrounded by a fully water saturated region 5 results k and k r upscaling we first evaluate upscaling methods of permeability and relative permeability in order to explain and justify the chosen method described in section 3 1 in this stage of the investigation p c is upscaled using the cl method as described in section 3 2 3 fig 5 presents results for horizontally averaged saturation as a function of layer number at 3 times t 100 t 0 02 and t 0 01 days considering case 1 the first time fig 5a is the equilibrium solution the second fig 5b will be referred to as transient 2 and the last fig 5c is transient 1 the fine grid solution is compared with coarse scale solutions in which k is upscaled using different methods arithmetic average k a harmonic average k h and k ef given by eq 7 relative permeability is not upscaled so that the coarse and fine simulations both have uniform k r curves given by eqs 5a b with m w m co 2 2 it is clear that the equilibrium solution is not dependent on k directly and therefore all different upscaling methods considered lead to the same result in fig 5a furthermore the upscaling is clearly not accurate as the coarse scale saturation fails to match the fine grid solution in the two transient cases figs 5b c k upscaling is seen to have an impact and k ef matches the fine grid solution significantly better than the other methods using k ef for upscaling is rather intuitive as it becomes an accurate solution when the domain scale is much larger than the heterogeneity scale we therefore continue from here on by using eq 7 for permeability upscaling in order to test whether it is worthwhile to use an optimization approach for k r upscaling we consider optimizing the parameters m w and m co 2 in each coarse grid block to match the fine scale saturation distributing we implement the horizontal plane optimization h opt so that each horizontal layer has the same k r parameters and the objective function is given by eq 15 using equilibrium transient 1 and transient 2 as the optimization times we have m 3 and l z 10 in eq 15 and overall 20 variables for optimization we also test a simpler optimization in which we assume m w m co 2 leading to 10 optimization variables only the results are presented in fig 6 where it can be seen that the equilibrium upscaled results have an excellent match with the fine grid results however the transient results have a large error in fact the transient saturation nearly coincides with the initial one i e it appears that the segregation occurs much later for the coarse grid simulations when k r is upscaled using optimization there is no significant difference in the results when applying the optimization using 10 or 20 variables altogether we were not able to obtain a reasonable match for both equilibrium and transient results using k r optimization upscaling this is in line with our expectation that the coarse simulations should be somewhat less sensitive to k r upscaling compared to p c upscaling since the source of the co2 trapping is in fact capillary pressure related the conclusion from the tests presented in this section is that we can suffice with a simple approach for k and k r upscaling and focus on p c upscaling using optimization from here on k will be upscaled using eq 7 and k r using the cl power law method as described in section 3 1 6 results capillary pressure upscaling in this section we present and discuss the results for coarse grid simulations applying optimization upscaling to p c case1 is considered first since it is a difficult case to upscale exhibiting significant capillary entry pressure trapping as discussed previously all three optimization methods are applied hv opt section 3 2 1 consisting of 20 variables h opt section 3 2 2 consisting of 10 variables and block optimization b opt given by eq 13 consisting of 250 variables results are presented in figs 7 and 8 for horizontally and vertically averaged saturation respectively for comparison the fine scale and cl upscaling results are also plotted fig 7 shows large errors for cl upscaling as the co2 trapping at equilibrium conditions fig 7a is underestimated leading to more than twice as much co2 at the top layer than the fine scale saturation at transient 1 and 2 conditions fig 7c and b respectively cl upscaling results show a more reasonable match to the fine scale results however a significant difference is still apparent in particular for the transient 2 time all three optimization upscaling methods are seen to produce similar results in fig 7 matching the fine scale with sufficient accuracy the error for each upscaling method corresponding to fig 7 is calculated for each time state t s by the following formula 16 e h 1 l z r 1 l z s co 2 f t s c h r s co 2 c t s h r and the results are presented in table 2 we note that the error e h is similar to the objective function of the h opt method in eq 15 however it is defined here for a certain time state we apply eq 16 to calculate the error associated with horizontally averaged saturation for all the methods the smallest error for all three times is seen to be associated with h opt as the variables and objective function in this method are tailored to obtain the best match for layer average saturation however the errors for the two other optimization methods hv opt and b opt are not much larger the cl method on the other hand is seen to have an error at equilibrium which is larger by an order of magnitude in comparison the optimization methods fig 8 shows results for the different upscaling methods in terms of vertically averaged saturation time variation is seen to be less dramatic since most of the co2 migration is in the vertical and not the horizontal direction nevertheless a mismatch from the fine scale solution is seen for the cl and h opt upscaling results the former is in agreement with previous results for horizontal averages however the h opt results were accurate previously this is again due to the optimization variables used in the h opt which are constant on horizontal planes and are designed to capture the vertical co2 migration only the hv opt and b opt methods are seen to have a much better match to the fine scale results the time averaged error is presented in table 3 considering three different error calculation methods horizontal layer error given by eq 16 averaging the rows of table 2 vertical plane average error given by 17 e v 1 2 ml y s 1 m r 1 l y s co 2 f t s c v x r s co 2 c t s v x r 1 2 ml x s 1 m r 1 l x s co 2 f t s c v y r s co 2 c t s v y r and block error given by 18 e b 1 ml s 1 m l 1 l s nw f t s l s nw c t s l we note that m 3 l x l y 5 l z 10 and l 250 in the above equations table 3 shows once again that error for horizontally averaged saturation is smallest with the h opt method however the same method leads to the largest errors in the vertically averaged and block saturations the former presenting errors even larger than cl upscaling for block errors we find that the b opt has the smallest error and for vertical plane errors both hv opt and b opt present the smallest errors altogether the b opt method appears to be the best upscaling method for matching the fine scale solution however it is not practical in terms of computational time optimizing the 250 variables of this method took approximately 69 h of computer time using a single intel i7 8700 cpu with maximum clock speed of 3 2 ghz on the other hand the h opt and hv opt methods had reasonable computational times of 30 and 50 min respectively we therefore use the hv opt approach from here on since it is shown to achieve sufficient accuracy with reasonable computational time previous literature suggested using variations of the cl upscaling method combined with percolation considerations to check the applicability of such a method we calculated p c using the percolation cl method described in section 3 2 3 and tested the upscaling on coarse grid simulations we found that the results were very similar to the cl results presented in figs 7 and 8 nearly coinciding with the cl curves despite the fact that the p c were altered when percolation was introduced the change did not significantly alter the saturation distribution and this result is consistent with our findings in cheng and rabinovich 2020 we believe that the significant impact which was observed in previous literature was due to the 1d and 2d flows considered which allows much less connected pathways in comparison to the 3d flow in this work we continue to investigate upscaling of various different cases cases2 7 in table 1 and to test the hv opt method fig 9 presents average co2 vertical profiles for cases 3 5 of top injection at equilibrium time each case has a different initial co2 distribution as plotted in fig 3 it is apparent that when the initial saturation is sufficiently large as in figs 9b and c the cl upscaling is accurate and an excellent match between coarse and fine scale solutions can be seen as the saturation is reduced cl upscaling accuracy decreases figs 9b and c and for the smallest saturation tested case2 fig 10 a the largest discrepancy is seen the optimization upscaling results also plotted in fig 9 match fine scale results in all three cases showing that the optimization approach is applicable even when conventional cl upscaling is accurate of course the latter upscaling method is preferable when applicable due to its simplicity and efficiency fig 10 presents the results for case2 consisting of a relatively small amount of co2 injected at the top of the domain the hv opt is applied and the coarse simulation results are seen to be very accurate for equilibrium and transient 2 times in particular an improvement in comparison to the cl upscaling is seen for these times as the latter method shows no equilibrium co2 trapped in the lowest layers for transient 1 fig 10c however hv opt upscaling is less accurate than the cl method this is caused by an asymmetry in the objective function eq 14 which applies more weight to the late times and thus the equilibrium and transient 2 errors are very small at the expense of the transient 1 time improved results can be obtained by adding weights to the objective function so that the transient 1 results will improve at the expense of the later time results we do not present these results as we feel they are not necessary considering the sufficient accuracy achieved even for hv opt upscaling in fig 10c this is supported by the overall errors presented in table 4 for case2 showing comparable values to those of case1 table 3 and significantly smaller errors than the cl upscaling table 4 also presents errors for cases3 5 in which initial saturation is obtained from top injection considering the hv opt upscaling errors are always smaller or similar to those of the cl method indicating the advantage of optimization upscaling two additional bottom injection cases were tested consisting of different initial saturation distribution cases6 and 7 the results are consistent with those of case1 showing good agreement with the fine scale solution and significantly smaller errors in comparison to the cl method the final case considered consists of the same initial saturation as case1 but with an anisotropic permeability distribution fig 11 presents the results where it is seen that the trapping increases in comparison to case1 fig 7 and therefore the cl upscaling is even more inaccurate with overall error of 0 0742 the anisotropy in this case consists of horizontally elongated structures and these are responsible for more entry pressure trapping the coarse scale results with hv opt upscaling are seen to match the fine scale results and the accuracy is particularly impressive when compared to the poor accuracy of cl upscaling overall errors for case8 presented in table 4 are sufficiently small and much smaller than the cl errors 7 applicability of optimization upscaling the results of the previous section established that the optimization upscaling using the hv method is sufficiently accurate for a wide variety of cases however the upscaled parameters α l in eq 12 are obtained in a calibration type optimization procedure using the fine grid simulation results therefore there is no reduction of computational time but rather an added time associated with the optimization saving computational cost is possible if these parameters can be applied to other cases of interest for example it is common to simulate flow in subsurface formations considering different realizations of the permeability field we now use the optimized upscaled capillary pressure parameters from case1 in simulations with different k realizations consisting of the same statistical characteristics k 100 md σ y 2 3 and l x l y l z 0 1 upscaling k and k r is conducted for each realization separately however these are rapid calculations with negligible computational cost coarse grid simulations with the α l parameters from case1 were conducted for 10 realizations and the results are compared with the corresponding fine grid simulations fig 12 presents results for two realizations realization 1 figs 12c and realization 2 figs 12d f at the three time states transient 1 transient 2 and equilibrium it can be seen that despite having the same statistical properties saturation profiles are different between realization 1 and realization 2 and also different than case1 see fig 7 realization 1 was chosen as it was found to have the best match between coarse and fine grid simulations and indeed a very good match is seen between the two in figs 12a c realization 2 was found to have the worst match of the 10 realizations and yet figs 12d f show that the match is quite good in particular for the equilibrium time furthermore the alternative of using cl upscaling would lead to an extremely large mismatch for each realization at equilibrium and late times since no trapping would be obtained in the lower layers as seen in fig 7 fig 13 presents results for all 10 realizations showing the coarse and fine grid simulation saturation profiles as well as the ensemble averages for each it can be seen that the ensemble averages of the coarse and fine grid simulations are in general agreement and accuracy appears to be similar to that of realization 1 in fig 12 a similar analysis was also carried out for case8 considering different realizations of statistically anisotropic permeability l x l y 0 2 and l z 0 05 the α l parameters from case8 were used in coarse grid simulations of 10 realizations and the results are plotted in fig 14 the plots show satisfactory agreement between the coarse and fine scale results indicating that the upscaling is able to capture the trapping in the anisotropic case as well overall using calibrated p c parameters from one realization for simulations of many other realizations is found to be applicable in terms of computational efficiency a coarse grid simulation took 10 15 s to carry out while a fine grid simulation took around 50 min a speedup factor of 200 300 therefore to conduct 10 simulations takes over 8 h using fine grid simulations while less than 2 h are required using the optimization upscaling method 50 min for a single fine grid simulation 50 min for optimization and 2 min for coarse grid simulations of course the computational reduction becomes even more significant as the number of simulations increases since the upscaling approach will remain around 2 h while the fine scale times increase linearly with the number of runs considering that hundreds of realizations are often used for uncertainty quantification this upscaling approach would result in a dramatic reduction of computational cost an additional proof of applicability of the optimization upscaling is presented in figs 15 and 16 the calibrated α l parameters from case1 are used in coarse grid simulations with permeability realizations characterized by the statistics of case8 i e isotropic k optimization parameters are implemented in simulations of anisotropic realizations results for two realizations best and worst cases are presented in fig 14 where it can be seen that there is a reasonable match between coarse and fine scale saturation profiles comparing this figure with fig 12 it is apparent that the match is not as good as for the latter case fig 16 presents the ensemble average comparison showing a reasonable agreement between coarse and fine scale results once again the match is not as accurate in comparison to the previous tests presented in figs 13 and 14 this is due to the impact of anisotropy on entry pressure trapping increasing the phenomenon in comparison to the isotropic cases thus using the isotropic α l parameters in anisotropic simulations leads to an underestimation of co2 trapping in the lower parts of the domain and therefore more co2 in the upper part of the domain this is observed consistently in figs 15 and 16 nevertheless the approach is believed to be applicable considering the alternative of cl upscaling which for these simulations at equilibrium and late times would result in no co2 trapping in the lower layers and therefore a very large mismatch between coarse and fine scale results 8 discussion problems of multiphase flow are known to be characterized by the capillary and gravity numbers representing the interplay between viscous gravity and capillary forces for problems of gravity segregation with capillary heterogeneity that are considered here only the gravity and capillary forces are significant and therefore the bond number is usually used for characterization following rabinovich and cheng 2020 we define the bond number as 19 n b α k δ ρ gh 2 where δ ρ ρ w ρ co 2 and h is the domain height substituting the problem parameters for the cases considered here shows that the bond number is the same for all 8 case i e n b 75 and this value corresponds to the second case considered in rabinovich and cheng 2020 see figs 9 cd therein which showed both capillary and gravity effects i e an intermediate bond number the accuracy of upscaling methods is expected to be closely related to the bond number for small n b gravity forces dominate and the problem is relatively simple to solve upscaling using any approach should lead to accurate coarse grid simulations for large n b capillary forces dominate and cl upscaling is expected to be accurate intermediate values of n b are most difficult to solve and to upscale however it was shown that even for intermediate n b values when there is no entry pressure in capillary pressure curves an analytical solution exists for equilibrium conditions and upscaling can be achieved with a simple approach such as cl this work focuses on challenging cases and therefore all cases considered had an intermediate n b value as well as entry pressure trapping nevertheless we still find a significant difference in the cl applicability despite having intermediate n b values and entry pressure for all 8 cases this was found to be related to the extent of capillary entry pressure trapping occurring as discussed below for each case we estimate the amount of trapping which is a result of entry pressure considerations this is carried out by comparing the fine grid equilibrium simulation results to the analytical solution of rabinovich and cheng 2020 which does not incorporate entry pressure trapping for a detailed description of entry pressure trapping mechanism and the derivation of the analytical solution we refer the reader to rabinovich and cheng 2020 moreno and rabinovich 2021 entry pressure trapping is therefore quantified as s co 2 f s co 2 an s co 2 where s co 2 an is the analytical solution for equilibrium conditions and s co 2 is the overall average saturation which is the same for both solutions when the simulation includes very little entry pressure trapping the saturation solution will be close to the analytical one and this quantity will approach zero as the entry pressure trapping increases the saturation solution will depart from the analytical one and the defined quantity will increase fig 17 depicts the overall upscaling error for cases1 8 given by eq 16 normalized by s co 2 as a function of the entry pressure trapping defined above it can be clearly seen that the error of the cl upscaling method increases when capillary entry pressure trapping is increased this supports our conjuncture that the reason for large errors in coarse grid simulations is the inability to accurately model entry pressure trapping this type of trapping is almost completely absent from the coarse simulations as seen in figs 7a and 11a in which the cl upscaling shows no co2 at the bottom half of the domain the upscaling error for the optimization method on the other hand is seen to increase slightly for small entry pressure trapping values and then level off to a constant reasonable error as trapping increases it is therefore concluded that the coarse grid simulations with hv opt upscaling are able to model the entry pressure trapping leading to a significantly better agreement with fine grid simulations entry pressure trapping occurs during the transient stage of the fluid segregation when regions with co2 find themselves surrounded by a fully water saturated shell region which blocks the co2 movement trapping it in place therefore it is intuitive that cases with less initial co2 will generally have more entry pressure trapping as there is more opportunity for fully water saturated regions to exist indeed the points in fig 17 are ordered from the smallest s co 2 case6 having the largest value of entry pressure trapping to the largest s co 2 case5 having the least trapping the exception to this rule is case8 which due to anisotropy has increased trapping and this is observed comparing with case1 furthermore top injection s w init distribution is expected to generally have less entry pressure trapping than bottom injection since the latter case has more opportunity for co2 to find itself surrounded by water regions as it migrates towards the top of the domain indeed the cases with top injection cases2 5 have the smallest values of entry pressure trapping although this appears to be a less significant factor compared to s co 2 discussed previously to gain some understanding regarding the improved accuracy of the optimization method we investigate the calibrated parameters α l from eq 12 fig 18 presents these parameters obtained by applying the optimization of the h opt method i e α l varies only by layer it can be seen that the parameter values depend on the initial guess of α l used as input in the optimization algorithm i e different initial guesses lead to a different α l result despite a similar small value of the objective function eq 15 this indicates that the optimization converges to local minima rather than a global one as common in complex many variable problems the initial guess taken in all optimization methods consisted of constant α l with values ranging between 5 15 despite the different parameter values it is apparent that the curves in fig 18 have a similar trend i e the α l variation is similar in structure this structure is what allows modelling the capillary entry pressure trapping and thus the high accuracy of the method parameters α l are in fact the entry pressure for each layer it can be seen that the maximum in entry pressure is consistently at the top of the domain around layers 2 3 and this is responsible for delaying the co2 migration to the top and ultimately increasing the trapping at the lower layers when observing in more detail it can be seen that there are two maxima at layers 2 3 and 7 followed by two minima near layers 5 and 9 these correspond to the two maxima in co2 observed in fig 18 thus the minima in entry pressure seen at layers 5 and 9 act as trapping zones for co2 and allow to enhance overall trapping which is typically grossly underestimated in coarse grid simulations 9 summary and conclusions this work presented a new upscaling method based on an effective property formula for k power law averaging in the capillary limit for k r and an optimization approach for p c the method was developed for upscaling flow driven by gravity and capillary forces i e gravity segregation of two fluids subjected to capillary heterogeneity effects the new method is applied to 8 example cases with different initial fluid distributions and permeability fields we show that the new upscaling method leads to coarse grid simulations that match the fine scale results with sufficient accuracy the optimization upscaling approach can be implemented in various techniques consisting of different numbers of calibration parameters three such methods were presented and evaluated horizontal plane optimization h opt horizontal and vertical plane optimization hv opt and block optimization b opt the hv opt method was shown to optimally balance between accuracy and computational efficiency the new method is able to accurately match fine grid simulation results for horizontally averaged and vertically averaged saturation these accuracies are significantly higher than those of the conventional cl method which is shown to underestimate the lighter phase saturation at the lower regions of the domain we demonstrate that the reason for this underestimation and the overall inaccuracy of the cl upscaling is related to the mechanism of entry pressure trapping therefore the success of the optimization upscaling is related to the entry pressure structure of the upscaled p c curve which promotes trapping the new upscaling method is implemented in a global approach i e a fine grid simulation is required for the calibration of the upscaled parameters this type of upscaling usually serves as a stepping stone towards more efficient local upscaling methods nevertheless the current method is shown to be applicable in a stochastic framework in which many simulations are carried out for different k realizations constrained to certain stochastic characteristics the optimized p c parameters from one realization of lognormal k distribution with given mean and variance of log k were used in simulations of many other realizations the results showed sufficient accuracy of the coarse scale results in comparison to the fine scale ones furthermore even considering realizations with changing anisotropy ratio reasonable accuracy was found although less than the cases in which the calibrated k and the additional realizations consisted of the same anisotropy ratio overall we believe that the new method is applicable to realistic cases of gravity capillary driven flow simulations it also may serve as a preliminary step towards developing similar yet more efficient methods in general upscaling methods based on optimization or machine learning algorithms should be further explored as conventional methods have been found to be inaccurate for many flow scenarios such as those presented in this work credit authorship contribution statement kan bun cheng conceptualization software formal analysis validation writing

distributions of settlement and groundwater drawdown in depth around an excavation during the dewatering inside the excavation they found that the greatest settlement appeared in the deep aquifer close to the bottom of the cut off wall of the excavation similarly zeng et al 2019a and li et al 2020 stated that the surface settlement was smaller than that in deep soil and the largest settlement appeared in the dewatered aquifer where the groundwater level experienced great decline wang et al 2018 experimentally investigated this problem and found that the aquitard above the dewatered aquifer expanded during the dewatering leading to a smaller subsidence at the top of the overlying aquitard than at the bottom zhang et al 2017 zeng et al 2019a and zheng et al 2019b also ascribed the greater deformation in deep soil to the expansion of aquitard overlying the dewatered aquifer and further indicated that the soil arching effect formed in the overlying aquitard should be the underlying reason different from the above studies pujades et al 2017 stated that the greatest settlement induced by dewatering would sometimes appear in the deep soil but sometimes appear at the ground surface and the permeability of the aquitards close to the dewatering aquifer is a key factor affecting the result this indicates that the location of the greatest settlement logs due to dewatering is uncertain and may be dependent to the hydraulic condition of the soil strata however the current investigations have not yet proposed a method to estimate logs also whether the logs is shifting with the evolution of groundwater drawdown during the dewatering is still unclear the objective of this study is to reveal the evolution law of logs subject to groundwater drawdown during dewatering and provide insights to help determine logs in situ pumping test and numerical simulation are employed as the methodology of this study first the hydrogeological condition and the procedures of the

engineering design 2 project background fig 1 presents a plan view of the investigated excavation and plan layout of pumping wells and part of monitoring points only those in north side were shown for a metro station in tianjin china the total length and width of the excavation were approximately 155 and 40 m respectively the final excavation depth was 17 19 m watertight diaphragm walls with a thickness of 0 8 m and depths of 32 34 m were used as enclosure structures to surround the excavated area fig 2 presents a typical soil profile on the north side of the excavation together with the basic soil properties all the parameters were obtained from geotechnical site investigation in the upper 50 m below the ground level bgl silty clays silts and silty sands were the main soil types encountered during the drilling there were five aquifers labelled as aq0 aqi aqii aqiii and aqiv respectively divided by four aquitards within 50 m bgl the buried depth and thickness of aq0 aqi and aqii showed a certain difference there were multiple sand lens in the depths between 20 m bgl and 37 m bgl leading to close hydraulic connection among the aquifers in this depth range the initial groundwater levels for aq0 aqiv were observed at 2 0 2 7 3 0 3 2 and 3 7 m bgl respectively apparently the final excavation depth i e 17 19 m was deeper than the initial groundwater level and thus dewatering should be conducted to facilitate the construction to evaluate the effect of dewatering on the surrounding environment pumping test was implemented before excavation 3 pumping test as shown in fig 1 25 pumping wells were arranged inside the excavation and 7 observation wells were installed on the north side of the excavation fig 3 shows the structures of pumping and observation wells and their relative positions to the soil layers and enclosure wall of the excavation the pumping wells were 23 25 m long inserting into aqii thus the water level in aqii can be reduced during the dewatering because the enclosure wall of the excavation did not totally cut off aqii the dewatering would bring about groundwater level decline and ground settlement outside the excavation there were two types of observation wells 18 m long to monitor water level in aq0 and aqi and 31 m long for aqii additionally ground surface settlements were monitored at 8 sections on the north side in each monitoring section 5 settlement points were installed with a spacing of 2 m for adjacent points the ground settlement was observed by electronic level model trimble dini12 the precision for each monitoring point was smaller than 0 1 mm after the installation of enclosure wall of the excavation a series of pumping tests were conducted inside the excavation for 21 days in this study only a typical test is introduced during which 22 pumping wells were simultaneously opened for 3 2 days i e 77 h to withdraw groundwater note the results of this test are shown in section 4 as comparisons with the computed data water pumps in 22 wells were buried at 19 m below the ground level and further 3 pumping wells j6 j12 and j22 were served as observation wells to record the groundwater level drawdown inside the excavation water level decline in different aquifers outside the excavation and surrounding ground surface settlement were also monitored during the test 4 numerical analysis 4 1 calculation method and influence range the aforementioned pumping test was simulated through a numerical model developed in the commonly used package abaqus which considers the fluid solid coupling based on the biot consolidation theory biot 1941 the groundwater transport obeys the fluid mass balance equation and darcy s law and the soil mass deformation is governed by a specified constitutive law pore water pressure is involved in constitutive law and is able to affect the volumetric strains of the soil mass in accordance with the biot consolidation theory biot 1941 the detailed descriptions e g the theory the coupling procedures and the governing differential equations about the fluid solid coupling method can be seen in li et al 2020 and wu et al 2020b the sichardt s formula i e r 10 s w k h bear 1979 was used to compute the influence radius of dewatering r where s w is the groundwater level drawdown of pumped aquifer inside the excavation i e aqii k h is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of aqii assuming an ultimate drawdown of 35 5 m in aqii the sichardt s formula gives r 615 m k h 3 m d is employed the lateral soil boundaries should be set beyond the influence range of dewatering to eliminate the boundary effect on the computed results the lateral boundaries were specified at 800 m away from the excavation fig 4 shows the dimension and mesh of the numerical model only half of the foundation pit i e 77 5 m by 40 0 m in plane was modelled considering the symmetry the model depth was set as 50 m with 12 different soil layers reflecting the site condition shown in fig 2 the structure of pumping well was simulated by 4 node doubly curved shell element the diameter of the well structure was set as 400 mm according with that employed in the pumping test the stress strain relation of pumping well was assumed to obey the linear elastic model and the young s moduli of the pumping well was set as 210 gpa the enclosure wall was simulated by 8 node linear solid incompatible elements the geometry of the enclosure wall in the model was generally in accord with that in the pumping test the stress strain relation of the enclosure wall was assumed to obey the linear elastic model and the young s moduli of the enclosure wall was set as 30 gpa 4 2 initial boundary conditions soils at the symmetrical plane were not allowed to move in the normal direction to this plane but can move freely in the other directions soils in the model surface were free to move in all the directions on the asymmetric lateral planes and the bottom of the model soil movements were restricted in all the directions because the main focus of this study is to reveal the deformation behaviour of soils subject to groundwater drawdown during foundation pit dewatering the enclosure wall movements were restricted in all directions to eliminate the effect of enclosure wall movement on the ground settlement for the hydraulic boundary the symmetrical plane and the model bottom were set to be impermeable while the asymmetric lateral planes were specified a constant head equal to the initial water head of each layer which was set at the model surface for simplicity 4 3 pumping simulation during the pumping test water level inside the pumping well declined rapidly causing a difference of water head between the inside and outside of the pumping well groundwater then flowed into the well and was withdrawn by a submersible pump zeng et al 2018 and li et al 2020 applied a prescribed flow rate on the grid points of well screen to simulate a pumping process however flow rate was not measured during the pumping test and the simulation method adopted by the above researchers cannot be applied in this study fortunately the water level drawdowns inside the pumping wells were observed in real time and a fast decline of water level was observed in the end of the pumping test water level dropped by approximately 15 m inside the pumping wells for simplicity a constant head boundary was specified on the soil grids in contact with the well screen with zero water head fixed at the depth range of 0 15 m bgl and a hydrostatic pressure head fixed from 15 m bgl to 24 m bgl i e the bottom of the well screen as schematically shown in fig 5 the detailed contact properties between the soils and wells can be referred to in zeng et al 2018 4 4 input parameters and model validation li et al 2020 stated that a linear elastic perfectly plastic constitutive law with the plasticity plateau described by the mohr coulomb strength criterion is able to well simulate the soil behaviour during the pumping test thus this constitutive model is adopted in this study to model the soil behaviour table 1 shows the input parameters of the model for each soil layer the values of most parameters were extracted from fig 2 except the elastic modulus e and hydraulic conductivity k h and k v which were obtained by an inversion calculation based on the pumping test introduced in section 3 before the inversion calculation some trail simulations of the pumping test were conducted the initial e was calculated based on the shear modulus g and poisson s ratio μ using equation 1 1 e 2 1 μ g according to zeng et al 2018 μ for silty clay and silts or silty sands can be set as 0 33 and 0 3 respectively according to li et al 2020 dong et al 2016 and chen et al 2011 g can be approximated by shear wave velocity νs using equation 2 zheng et al 2014 2 g 0 5 ρ ν s 2 where ρ is the soil density combining the above two equations and putting the field data of νs shown in fig 2 into the equations e can be obtained and was employed in the trail simulations however the computed water level drawdown and ground settlement were not able to match the measured data thus inversion calculation was performed to acquire e k h and k v by fitting the computed results with those measured in the pumping test the inversion procedure is similar with that conducted by wang et al 2019 taking the observation wells on the north side of the excavation as examples fig 6 presents the comparison between the computed and measured groundwater level drawdown inside and outside the excavation generally the computed results are able to fit the measured results especially for the final water level drawdown both results indicate that water level inside the excavation refer to j6 and j12 finally dropped by 14 15 m causing drawdown of 4 5 7 5 m in aqii g2 1 and g2 4 and 2 3 m in aq0 and aqi g1 1 and g1 2 outside the excavation the relatively large discrepancy between the computed and measured results at the beginning of the dewatering is attributed to the simplified pumping simulation which initially produces a significant water level decline inside the excavation taking the settlement points on the north side of the excavation as examples fig 7 compares the computed and measured ground surface settlements in the end of the pumping test the computed settlements are able to roughly fit the measured settlements with deviations of mostly 20 of the measured ones specifically the computed settlements at section 1 are greater than those measured while the computed settlements at sections 3 and 5 are smaller than those measured indicating that the corner effect developed in the numerical model is not as apparent as that formed in the practical construction the reason for the data deviation between the computed and measured ones may be due to the inconsistent thickness of soil layer and the diversity of soil properties in the real geological condition which cannot be reflected by the simplified numerical model also the simplified simulations of diaphragm wall and pumping process should be another possible reason 4 5 evolutions of groundwater drawdown and ground settlement taking a typical vertical section e g 9 m behind the diaphragm wall of deep excavation as an example fig 8 presents the evolutions of groundwater drawdown and ground settlement during the pumping simulation because the watertight diaphragm wall did not totally cut off aqii water level in aqii outside the excavation dropped quickly and significantly in the meantime groundwater in overlying and underlying aquifers i e aqi and aqiii flowed into aqii under a hydraulic gradient formed during the pumping leading to continuous water level declines in these aquifers correspondingly the ground settlements outside the excavation evolved with time with the location of the greatest settlement logs shifting upward by comparing the two figures in fig 8 one can perceive that with the pumping time elapsed logs and the zero drawdown location above aqii move upward simultaneously the two positions are always close this result is understandable because the groundwater drawdown in every stratum would induce ground settlement there and thus the settlement would be accumulated upward until a stratum with zero drawdown was encountered above the zero drawdown location the continuous decrease of ground settlement should be caused by the expansion of soil mass in that range pujades et al 2014a pujades et al 2014b pujades et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 zeng et al 2019a zheng et al 2019b therefore logs could be identified according to the depth position of the adjacent observation well showing zero drawdown during foundation pit dewatering considering the pumping locations e g pumping from phreatic or confined aquifers and the hydraulic connectivity between aquifers would greatly affect the distribution of groundwater drawdown especially the location with zero drawdown detailed discussions are conducted in the following to clarify the effect of these factors on the evolution of logs during pumping 5 discussions 5 1 effect of hydraulic connectivity between aquifers the permeability of aquitard significantly affects the hydraulic connectivity between aquifers in this section the hydraulic conductivity of adii and adiii i e k adii and k adiii were selected as changing parameters with both the horizonal and vertical k adii and k adiii varying from 10 k 0 adii or 10 k 0 adiii to 10 4 k 0 adii or 10 4 k 0 adiii where k 0 adii and k 0 adiii represent the basic values of k adii and k adiii shown in table 1 during each calculation only k adii or k adiii varied and all the other parameters were set the same as those introduced in section 4 considering that a relatively long time is needed for drainage in aquitards especially when a very low hydraulic conductivity was applied the pumping time was uniformly set to 200 days in all the calculations the following descriptions are based on the results in the end of the pumping unless otherwise stated the vertical section of 9 m behind the diaphragm wall of deep excavation is also taken as an example to show the computed results the results at other distances are similar but show some differences in magnitude fig 9 presents the vertical distributions of groundwater drawdown and ground settlement under different k adii with the decrease of k adii drawdowns above adii reduced significantly but showed a slight increase below adii which is attributed to the decrement of groundwater leakage from aquifers above adii in particular when k adii was smaller than 10 2 k 0 adii i e smaller than k h 6 10 5 m d and k v 1 10 5 m d zero drawdown basically appeared above the top surface of adii accordingly the greatest settlement appeared at the top of adii however as k adii increased and was larger than 10 1 k 0 adii i e larger than k h 6 10 4 m d and k v 1 10 4 m d the location of the greatest settlement logs shifted upward and eventually stayed at approximately the ground surface where the corresponding drawdown was close to 0 fig 10 presents the vertical distributions of groundwater drawdown and ground settlement under different k adiii with the decrease of k adiii drawdowns below adiii reduced dramatically while showed a slight increase above adiii which is attributed to the decrement of groundwater leakage from aquifers below adiii as to ground settlement the case with a smaller k adiii showed a smaller settlement in any depths the location of the greatest settlement logs always stayed at approximately the ground surface where the corresponding drawdown was close to 0 by comparing the figs 9 and 10 one can summarize that the variation of k adiii i e the hydraulic conductivity of an aquitard below the pumped aquifer would neither greatly change the settlement profile along depth nor greatly affect the settlement magnitude however the variation of k adii i e the hydraulic conductivity of an aquitard above the pumped aquifer would both significantly affect the settlement profile and settlement magnitude fig 11 presents the variations of the greatest settlement s m and its locations with the vertical permeability of adii and adiii i e k v adii and k v adiii which in a better way illustrates the great influence of the permeability of adii i e the aquitard above the pumped aquifer on the pumping induced settlement property in practical engineering engineers should lay more emphasis on the determination of the hydraulic connection between the pumped aquifer and the overlying aquifer especially when the deformation sensitive buildings or facilities exist outside the excavation otherwise the measured responses of them may be far beyond expectation additionally from fig 11 b one can perceive that a good agreement is always presented between the location of the greatest settlement logs and the zero drawdown location l 0d above the pumped aquifer no matter whether the hydraulic connectivity between aquifers is good or not therefore logs can be preliminarily determined by the depth position of the adjacent observation well showing zero drawdown during foundation pit dewatering 5 2 effect of pumping location in the above simulations groundwater pumping was modelled by applying a constant head boundary on the grid points of well screen in the depth range of 0 24 m below the ground level bgl in this section the pumping of confined aquifers aqii and aqiii was simulated as to pumping of aqii a hydrostatic pressure head was applied at the depth range of aqii i e from 22 m bgl to 35 5 m bgl with 120 kpa at 22 m bgl and 255 kpa at 35 5 m bgl i e groundwater drawdown of 10 m inside the pumping well was assumed likewise as to pumping of aqiii the hydrostatic pressure head was applied at the depth range of aqiii also assuming a 10 m drawdown inside the pumping well two types of hydrogeology conditions were considered one was identical to that defined in table 1 representing a site with relatively strong hydraulic connectivity between aquifers labelled as site i the other one was just the reverse corresponding to a site labelled as site ii with relatively poor hydraulic connectivity between aquifers i e k adii and k adiii were both reduced by 104 times the pumping time was uniformly set to 200 days in all the calculations the following descriptions are based on the results in the end of the pumping unless otherwise stated the vertical section of 15 m behind the diaphragm wall of deep excavation is taken as an example to show the computed results the results at other distances are similar but show some differences in magnitude fig 12 presents the vertical distributions of groundwater drawdown and ground settlement during pumping of aqii and aqiii in site i i e the site with relatively strong hydraulic connectivity between aquifers the results at three typical moments i e 1 h 2 days and 200 days from the start of pumping were extracted to show the settlement profile and drawdown profile in the initial stage of pumping in aqii and aqiii zero drawdown basically appeared above the top of aqii accordingly the greatest settlements for both conditions appeared at the top of aqii although the pumped aquifers were different with the pumping time elapsed drawdowns above aqii gradually increased leading to the upward shift of the location of the greatest settlements which eventually stayed at the ground surface where the corresponding drawdown was 0 fig 13 shows the vertical distributions of groundwater drawdown and ground settlement during pumping of aqii and aqiii in site ii i e the site with relatively poor hydraulic connectivity between aquifers for both conditions the groundwater drawdowns in the pumped aquifers gradually increased however above the pumped aquifers the groundwater levels were basically unchanged throughout the pumping simulations accordingly the greatest settlements always stayed at the top surfaces of the pumped aquifers only the settlement magnitude enlarged continuously with the pumping time elapsed in practical engineering if the pumped aquifer is of poor hydraulic connectivity with the overlying and underlying aquifer more attention should be paid to the soil settlement close to the top of the pumped aquifer instead of the ground surface settlement especially when the deformation sensitive underground structures e g pile and deep tunnel exist outside the excavation one should avoid the simple thought that the ground surface settlement is the largest all the time although the current design code about settlement calculation suggests that otherwise the deep soil settlements would be underestimated posing potential threat to the deep underground structure in addition the computed ground settlements during pumping of aqii were mostly greater than those during pumping of aqiii although the prescribed groundwater drawdown inside the excavation were the same in both cases this result should be attributed to the larger thickness but smaller stiffness of aqii 6 conclusions in this study a fluid solid coupling numerical model was developed to simulate a practical pumping test the measured and computed ground settlement and groundwater drawdown were compared to validate the calculation model then extensive numerical simulations were conducted to clarify the evolution of the greatest settlement location under different pumping conditions based on this study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 if the pumped aquifer is of strong hydraulic connectivity with the overlying aquifers the pumping induced maximum settlement would initially appear at the top of the pumped aquifer but quickly shift upward to the ground surface however if a poor hydraulic connectivity exists between them the maximum settlement would always stay at the top of the pumped aquifer at this moment engineers should pay more attention to the monitoring of soil settlement close to the top of the pumped aquifer except the ground surface settlement otherwise the underground structures resting at the deep soil would be at risk of great settlement during pumping of groundwater 2 the permeability of the aquitard below the pumped aquifer has little impact on the settlement distribution along depth and settlement magnitude during pumping however the permeability of aquitard above the pumped aquifer would both significantly affect the settlement distribution and magnitude engineers should lay more emphasis on the determination of the permeability of aquitard above the pumped aquifer i e the hydraulic connection between the pumped aquifer and the overlying aquifer otherwise the measured settlement responses may be far beyond expectation 3 the location of the greatest settlement logs during pumping differs as the pumping condition changes however a good agreement always exists between logs and the zero drawdown location above the pumped aquifer no matter whether the hydraulic connectivity between aquifers is good or not and whether the pumping location is phreatic aquifer or confined aquifers credit

groundwater levels for aq0 aqiv were observed at 2 0 2 7 3 0 3 2 and 3 7 m bgl respectively apparently the final excavation depth i e 17 19 m was deeper than the initial groundwater level and thus dewatering should be conducted to facilitate the construction to evaluate the effect of dewatering on the surrounding environment pumping test was implemented before excavation 3 pumping test as shown in fig 1 25 pumping wells were arranged inside the excavation and 7 observation wells were installed on the north side of the excavation fig 3 shows the structures of pumping and observation wells and their relative positions to the soil layers and enclosure wall of the excavation the pumping wells were 23 25 m long inserting into aqii thus the water level in aqii can be reduced during the dewatering because the enclosure wall of the excavation did not totally cut off aqii the dewatering would bring about groundwater level decline and ground settlement outside the excavation there were two types of observation wells 18 m long to monitor water level in aq0 and aqi and 31 m long for aqii additionally ground surface settlements were monitored at 8 sections on the north side in each monitoring section 5 settlement points were installed with a spacing of 2 m for adjacent points the ground settlement was observed by electronic level model trimble dini12 the precision for each monitoring point was smaller than 0 1 mm after the installation of enclosure wall of the excavation a series of pumping tests were conducted inside the excavation for 21 days in this study only a typical test is introduced during which 22 pumping wells were simultaneously opened for 3 2 days i e 77 h to withdraw groundwater note the results of this test are shown in section 4 as comparisons with the computed data water pumps in 22 wells were buried at 19 m below the ground level and further 3 pumping wells j6 j12 and j22 were served as observation wells to record the groundwater level drawdown inside the excavation water level decline in different aquifers outside the excavation and surrounding ground surface settlement were also monitored during the test 4 numerical analysis 4 1 calculation method and influence range the aforementioned pumping test was simulated through a numerical model developed in the commonly used package abaqus which considers the fluid solid coupling based on the biot consolidation theory biot 1941 the groundwater transport obeys the fluid mass balance equation and darcy s law and the soil mass deformation is governed by a specified constitutive law pore water pressure is involved in constitutive law and is able to affect the volumetric strains of the soil mass in accordance with the biot consolidation theory biot 1941 the detailed descriptions e g the theory the coupling procedures and the governing differential equations about the fluid solid coupling method can be seen in li et al 2020 and wu et al 2020b the sichardt s formula i e r 10 s w k h bear 1979 was used to compute the influence radius of dewatering r where s w is the groundwater level drawdown of pumped aquifer inside the excavation i e aqii k h is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of aqii assuming an ultimate drawdown of 35 5 m in aqii the sichardt s formula gives r 615 m k h 3 m d is employed the lateral soil boundaries should be set beyond the influence range of dewatering to eliminate the boundary effect on the computed results the lateral boundaries were specified at 800 m away from the excavation fig 4 shows the dimension and mesh of the numerical model only half of the foundation pit i e 77 5 m by 40 0 m in plane was modelled considering the symmetry the model depth was set as 50 m with 12 different soil layers reflecting the site condition shown in fig 2 the structure of pumping well was simulated by 4 node doubly curved shell element the diameter of the well structure was set as 400 mm according with that employed in the pumping test the stress strain relation of pumping well was assumed to obey the linear elastic model and the young s moduli of the pumping well was set as 210 gpa the enclosure wall was simulated by 8 node linear solid incompatible elements the geometry of the enclosure wall in the model was generally in accord with that in the pumping test the stress strain relation of the enclosure wall was assumed to obey the linear elastic model and the young s moduli of the enclosure wall was set as 30 gpa 4 2 initial boundary conditions soils at the symmetrical plane were not allowed to move in the normal direction to this plane but can move freely in the other directions soils in the model surface were free to move in all the directions on the asymmetric lateral planes and the bottom of the model soil movements were restricted in all the directions because the main focus of this study is to reveal the deformation behaviour of soils subject to groundwater drawdown during foundation pit dewatering the enclosure wall movements were restricted in all directions to eliminate the effect of enclosure wall movement on the ground settlement for the hydraulic boundary the symmetrical plane and the model bottom were set to be impermeable while the asymmetric lateral planes were specified a constant head equal to the initial water head of each layer which was set at the model surface for simplicity 4 3 pumping simulation during the pumping test water level inside the pumping well declined rapidly causing a difference of water head between the inside and outside of the pumping well groundwater then flowed into the well and was withdrawn by a submersible pump zeng et al 2018 and li et al 2020 applied a prescribed flow rate on the grid points of well screen to simulate a pumping process however flow rate was not measured during the pumping test and the simulation method adopted by the above researchers cannot be applied in this study fortunately the water level drawdowns inside the pumping wells were observed in real time and a fast decline of water level was observed in the end of the pumping test water level dropped by approximately 15 m inside the pumping wells for simplicity a constant head boundary was specified on the soil grids in contact with the well screen with zero water head fixed at the depth range of 0 15 m bgl and a hydrostatic pressure head fixed from 15 m bgl to 24 m bgl i e the bottom of the well screen as schematically shown in fig 5 the detailed contact properties between the soils and wells can be referred to in zeng et al 2018 4 4 input parameters and model validation li et al 2020 stated that a linear elastic perfectly plastic constitutive law with the plasticity plateau described by the mohr coulomb strength criterion is able to well simulate the soil behaviour during the pumping test thus this constitutive model is adopted in this study to model the soil behaviour table 1 shows the input parameters of the model for each soil layer the values of most parameters were extracted from fig 2 except the elastic modulus e and hydraulic conductivity k h and k v which were obtained by an inversion calculation based on the pumping test introduced in section 3 before the inversion calculation some trail simulations of the pumping test were conducted the initial e was calculated based on the shear modulus g and poisson s ratio μ using equation 1 1 e 2 1 μ g according to zeng et al 2018 μ for silty clay and silts or silty sands can be set as 0 33 and 0 3 respectively according to li et al 2020 dong et al 2016 and chen et al 2011 g can be approximated by shear wave velocity νs using equation 2 zheng et al 2014 2 g 0 5 ρ ν s 2 where ρ is the soil density combining the above two equations and putting the field data of νs shown in fig 2 into the equations e can be obtained and was employed in the trail simulations however the computed water level drawdown and ground settlement were not able to match the measured data thus inversion calculation was performed to acquire e k h and k v by fitting the computed results with those measured in the pumping test the inversion procedure is similar with that conducted by wang et al 2019 taking the observation wells on the north side of the excavation as examples fig 6 presents the comparison between the computed and measured groundwater level drawdown inside and outside the excavation generally the computed results are able to fit the measured results especially for the final water level drawdown both results indicate that water level inside the excavation refer to j6 and j12 finally dropped by 14 15 m causing drawdown of 4 5 7 5 m in aqii g2 1 and g2 4 and 2 3 m in aq0 and aqi g1 1 and g1 2 outside the excavation the relatively large discrepancy between the computed and measured results at the beginning of the dewatering is attributed to the simplified pumping simulation which initially produces a significant water level decline inside the excavation taking the settlement points on the north side of the excavation as examples fig 7 compares the computed and measured ground surface settlements in the end of the pumping test the computed settlements are able to roughly fit the measured settlements with deviations of mostly 20 of the measured ones specifically the computed settlements at section 1 are greater than those measured while the computed settlements at sections 3 and 5 are smaller than those measured indicating that the corner effect developed in the numerical model is not as apparent as that formed in the practical construction the reason for the data deviation between the computed and measured ones may be due to the inconsistent thickness of soil layer and the diversity of soil properties in the real geological condition which cannot be reflected by the simplified numerical model also the simplified simulations of diaphragm wall and pumping process should be another possible reason 4 5 evolutions of groundwater drawdown and ground settlement taking a typical vertical section e g 9 m behind the diaphragm wall of deep excavation as an example fig 8 presents the evolutions of groundwater drawdown and ground settlement during the pumping simulation because the watertight diaphragm wall did not totally cut off aqii water level in aqii outside the excavation dropped quickly and significantly in the meantime groundwater in overlying and underlying aquifers i e aqi and aqiii flowed into aqii under a hydraulic gradient formed during the pumping leading to continuous water level declines in these aquifers correspondingly the ground settlements outside the excavation evolved with time with the location of the greatest settlement logs shifting upward by comparing the two figures in fig 8 one can perceive that with the pumping time elapsed logs and the zero drawdown location above aqii move upward simultaneously the two positions are always close this result is understandable because the groundwater drawdown in every stratum would induce ground settlement there and thus the settlement would be accumulated upward until a stratum with zero drawdown was encountered above the zero drawdown location the continuous decrease of ground settlement should be caused by the expansion of soil mass in that range pujades et al 2014a pujades et al 2014b pujades et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 zeng et al 2019a zheng et al 2019b therefore logs could be identified according to the depth position of the adjacent observation well showing zero drawdown during foundation pit dewatering considering the pumping locations e g pumping from phreatic or confined aquifers and the hydraulic connectivity between aquifers would greatly affect the distribution of groundwater drawdown especially the location with zero drawdown detailed discussions are conducted in the following to clarify the effect of these factors on the evolution of logs during pumping 5 discussions 5 1 effect of hydraulic connectivity between aquifers the permeability of aquitard significantly affects the hydraulic connectivity between aquifers in this section the hydraulic conductivity of adii and adiii i e k adii and k adiii were selected as changing parameters with both the horizonal and vertical k adii and k adiii varying from 10 k 0 adii or 10 k 0 adiii to 10 4 k 0 adii or 10 4 k 0 adiii where k 0 adii and k 0 adiii represent the basic values of k adii and k adiii shown in table 1 during each calculation only k adii or k adiii varied and all the other parameters were set the same as those introduced in section 4 considering that a relatively long time is needed for drainage in aquitards especially when a very low hydraulic conductivity was applied the pumping time was uniformly set to 200 days in all the calculations the following descriptions are based on the results in the end of the pumping unless otherwise stated the vertical section of 9 m behind the diaphragm wall of deep excavation is also taken as an example to show the computed results the results at other distances are similar but show some differences in magnitude fig 9 presents the vertical distributions of groundwater drawdown and ground settlement under different k adii with the decrease of k adii drawdowns above adii reduced significantly but showed a slight increase below adii which is attributed to the decrement of groundwater leakage from aquifers above adii in particular when k adii was smaller than 10 2 k 0 adii i e smaller than k h 6 10 5 m d and k v 1 10 5 m d zero drawdown basically appeared above the top surface of adii accordingly the greatest settlement appeared at the top of adii however as k adii increased and was larger than 10 1 k 0 adii i e larger than k h 6 10 4 m d and k v 1 10 4 m d the location of the greatest settlement logs shifted upward and eventually stayed at approximately the ground surface where the corresponding drawdown was close to 0 fig 10 presents the vertical distributions of groundwater drawdown and ground settlement under different k adiii with the decrease of k adiii drawdowns below adiii reduced dramatically while showed a slight increase above adiii which is attributed to the decrement of groundwater leakage from aquifers below adiii as to ground settlement the case with a smaller k adiii showed a smaller settlement in any depths the location of the greatest settlement logs always stayed at approximately the ground surface where the corresponding drawdown was close to 0 by comparing the figs 9 and 10 one can summarize that the variation of k adiii i e the hydraulic conductivity of an aquitard below the pumped aquifer would neither greatly change the settlement profile along depth nor greatly affect the settlement magnitude however the variation of k adii i e the hydraulic conductivity of an aquitard above the pumped aquifer would both significantly affect the settlement profile and settlement magnitude fig 11 presents the variations of the greatest settlement s m and its locations with the vertical permeability of adii and adiii i e k v adii and k v adiii which in a better way illustrates the great influence of the permeability of adii i e the aquitard above the pumped aquifer on the pumping induced settlement property in practical engineering engineers should lay more emphasis on the determination of the hydraulic connection between the pumped aquifer and the overlying aquifer especially when the deformation sensitive buildings or facilities exist outside the excavation otherwise the measured responses of them may be far beyond expectation additionally from fig 11 b one can perceive that a good agreement is always presented between the location of the greatest settlement logs and the zero drawdown location l 0d above the pumped aquifer no matter whether the hydraulic connectivity between aquifers is good or not therefore logs can be preliminarily determined by the depth position of the adjacent observation well showing zero drawdown during foundation pit dewatering 5 2 effect of pumping location in the above simulations groundwater pumping was modelled by applying a constant head boundary on the grid points of well screen in the depth range of 0 24 m below the ground level bgl in this section the pumping of confined aquifers aqii and aqiii was simulated as to pumping of aqii a hydrostatic pressure head was applied at the depth range of aqii i e from 22 m bgl to 35 5 m bgl with 120 kpa at 22 m bgl and 255 kpa at 35 5 m bgl i e groundwater drawdown of 10 m inside the pumping well was assumed likewise as to pumping of aqiii the hydrostatic pressure head was applied at the depth range of aqiii also assuming a 10 m drawdown inside the pumping well two types of hydrogeology conditions were considered one was identical to that defined in table 1 representing a site with relatively strong hydraulic connectivity between aquifers labelled as site i the other one was just the reverse corresponding to a site labelled as site ii with relatively poor hydraulic connectivity between aquifers i e k adii and k adiii were both reduced by 104 times the pumping time was uniformly set to 200 days in all the calculations the following descriptions are based on the results in the end of the pumping unless otherwise stated the vertical section of 15 m behind the diaphragm wall of deep excavation is taken as an example to show the computed results the results at other distances are similar but show some differences in magnitude fig 12 presents the vertical distributions of groundwater drawdown and ground settlement during pumping of aqii and aqiii in site i i e the site with relatively strong hydraulic connectivity between aquifers the results at three typical moments i e 1 h 2 days and 200 days from the start of pumping were extracted to show the settlement profile and drawdown profile in the initial stage of pumping in aqii and aqiii zero drawdown basically appeared above the top of aqii accordingly the greatest settlements for both conditions appeared at the top of aqii although the pumped aquifers were different with the pumping time elapsed drawdowns above aqii gradually increased leading to the upward shift of the location of the greatest settlements which eventually stayed at the ground surface where the corresponding drawdown was 0 fig 13 shows the vertical distributions of groundwater drawdown and ground settlement during pumping of aqii and aqiii in site ii i e the site with relatively poor hydraulic connectivity between aquifers for both conditions the groundwater drawdowns in the pumped aquifers gradually increased however above the pumped aquifers the groundwater levels were basically unchanged throughout the pumping simulations accordingly the greatest settlements always stayed at the top surfaces of the pumped aquifers only the settlement magnitude enlarged continuously with the pumping time elapsed in practical engineering if the pumped aquifer is of poor hydraulic connectivity with the overlying and underlying aquifer more attention should be paid to the soil settlement close to the top of the pumped aquifer instead of the ground surface settlement especially when the deformation sensitive underground structures e g pile and deep tunnel exist outside the excavation one should avoid the simple thought that the ground surface settlement is the largest all the time although the current design code about settlement calculation suggests that otherwise the deep soil settlements would be underestimated posing potential threat to the deep underground structure in addition the computed ground settlements during pumping of aqii were mostly greater than those during pumping of aqiii although the prescribed groundwater drawdown inside the excavation were the same in both cases this result should be attributed to the larger thickness but smaller stiffness of aqii 6 conclusions in this study a fluid solid coupling numerical model was developed to simulate a practical pumping test the measured and computed ground settlement and groundwater drawdown were compared to validate the calculation model then extensive numerical simulations were conducted to clarify the evolution of the greatest settlement location under different pumping conditions based on this study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 if the pumped aquifer is of strong hydraulic connectivity with the overlying aquifers the pumping induced maximum settlement would initially appear at the top of the pumped aquifer but quickly shift upward to the ground surface however if a poor hydraulic connectivity exists between them the maximum settlement would always stay at the top of the pumped aquifer at this moment engineers should pay more attention to the monitoring of soil settlement close to the top of the pumped aquifer except the ground surface settlement otherwise the underground structures resting at the deep soil would be at risk of great settlement during pumping of groundwater 2 the permeability of the aquitard below the pumped aquifer has little impact on the settlement distribution along depth and settlement magnitude during pumping however the permeability of aquitard above the pumped aquifer would both significantly affect the settlement distribution and magnitude engineers should lay more emphasis on the determination of the permeability of aquitard above the pumped aquifer i e the hydraulic connection between the pumped aquifer and the overlying aquifer otherwise the measured settlement responses may be far beyond expectation 3 the location of the greatest settlement logs during pumping differs as the pumping condition changes however a good agreement always exists between logs and the zero drawdown location above the pumped aquifer no matter whether the hydraulic connectivity between aquifers is good or not and whether the pumping location is phreatic aquifer or confined aquifers credit
