12285,south sudan the world s newest nation is bestowed with huge fresh water resources however water resources management in south sudan is lacking in water quality monitoring data and comprehensive plans of action for sustainable water resources development groundwater resources in particular have been exploited for domestic and irrigation use versus surface water however this groundwater withdrawal has not been monitored for its level and quality to overcome this deficit groundwater major ion chemistry in the south sudan s eastern equatoria state was evaluated to determine its suitability for drinking domestic and irrigation purposes a total of 176 groundwater samples were collected during wet october 2014 and dry april 2014 seasons sampling points were spread around the eight counties of eastern equatoria twenty two water samples were collected from each county the samples were analysed for various physicochemical parameters including alkalinity calcium hardness conductivity ph salinity tds total hardness na k ca2 mg2 ba2 crt cd2 cu2 fet ni2 zn2 pb2 no3 cl f so4 2 po4 3 and sio2 groundwater irrigation quality indices including chlorinity index kelli index magnesium ratio percentage of sodium must be replaced by sodium percentage na permeability index pi residual sodium carbonate rsc salinity index sodicity index and sodium absorption ratio sar were calculated to determine the groundwater suitability for agricultural uses the results were compared with south sudan water quality guidelines sswqgs and the who standards most of the water quality parameters met the who standards and sswqgs prescribed for drinking and domestic purposes the calculated irrigation water quality indices indicated the water suitability for irrigation graphical abstract fx1 keywords south sudan groundwater water quality assessment major ion chemistry sustainable development goals 1 introduction south sudan became an independent country from sudan on 9th july 2011 after five decades of civil war that had devastated not only the lives and livelihoods of the south sudanese people but also their access to basic needs including safe water afdb 2013a south sudan is now facing tremendous challenges to meet the 2030 sustainable development goals sdgs formulated in 2015 as the 2030 agenda through water as key to sustainable development to overcome poverty hunger gender inequity and other adverse impacts wb 2011 as the corresponding data from south sudan show http southsudan opendataforafrica org apps gallery each of the 17 formulated goals will be a big challenge to achieve wb 2011 to begin with safe water provision is the fundamental key the water topic is not only covered by goal 6 clean water and sanitation but also included in goal 3 good health and well being goal 10 fight injustice and inequality and goals 14 and 15 protecting life in aquatic systems and on land respectively provision of chemically safe water enhances food security contributing to goals 1 and 2 eradicating or reducing hunger and poverty and to goal 5 gender equality reducing the discrimination of girls and women obliged to walk long distances for collecting water furthermore access to safe water and sanitation enhances job creation contributing to achieve goal 8 economic growth and decent work and goal 9 innovation infrastructure and industry including water and sanitation infrastructure in view of the above sustained development in the country will very much depend on secure access to its substantial water resources wb 2011 thus in the first part of the paper water availability and supply situation in south sudan is reviewed in the second part groundwater suitability in the south sudan s eastern equatoria state for drinking and irrigation purposes is discussed to the best of our knowledge for the first time groundwater chemical composition and variability in space and time are studied to establish a reliable database this will assist the decision and policy makers in providing safe drinking water and basic sanitation at household level this study will contribute in establishing a reliable water quality database for a proper development management and protection of ground and surface water resources for sustainable development on the country s way to meet the sdgs wrc 2008 2 key water issues and challenges in south sudan 2 1 water availability and supply situation in south sudan south sudan s renewable surface and groundwater resources stand at 49 5 km3 year afdb 2013a rainfall in the country is high with highland parts of eastern equatoria in the southern part and western equatoria receiving an annual rainfall between 1200 and 2200 mm fig 1 the lowland areas of bahr el ghazal eastern equatoria jonglei and upper nile receive annual rainfall between 700 and 1300 mm wb 2011 2 2 surface water resources the white nile river which has its three main tributaries of bahr el ghazal the three sub basins of jur kiir and loll the bahr el jebel tributaries aswa kiit and yei and the river sobat sub basins of pibor and akobo run from the south to north through the country in addition the country has the second world s largest swamp the sudd which covers 30 000 km2 which has many lakes and which is located on the bahr el jebel river this swamp area has been declared a ramsar site there are other wetland systems along the bahr el ghazal and the river sobat tributaries afdb 2013a all the wetlands comprise 7 of the total area of south sudan south sudan comprises 20 of the total nile river basin area afdb 2013a respectively despite these huge freshwater resources surface water is scarce during the dry season in areas that are not located on the river banks or where some of the tributaries dry up during the dry season 2 3 groundwater resources south sudan possesses large areas of land underlain by rich aquifers five main geological and respective hydrogeological units can be distinguished in south sudan fig 2 persits et al 2002 wb 2011 tertiary quaternary umm ruwaba formation found in most of the greater upper nile region and part of the eastern equatoria state its unconsolidated sediments seasonal rainfall and river floods predominantly recharge its aquifers and in some parts extend across international boundaries constitute aquifers with low to moderate water productivity quaternary unconsolidated sediments in the western and eastern flood plains of rivers in jonglei lakes and unity states with low to high water productivity of aquifers tertiary igneous volcanic rocks in eastern equatoria state and the adjacent part of jonglei state with a very variable water productivity ranging from very low to high cretaceous nubian sandstone formation in northern bahr el gazal state and part of gokrial state with intergranular sedimentary aquifers of low to high productivity precambrian basement in part of the central equatoria whole of western equatoria and western bahr el gazal states with low water productivity in this zone search for groundwater focuses on fractured and weathered zones however little is known regarding recharge aquifer connectivity and the relation between surface water bodies and groundwater which would be particularly important in the case of the umm ruwaba formation and the overlying surface water bodies particularly in the swamps zones demanding more information to establish water balances as base for a sustainable groundwater resources management further there is a need to explore 1 the distribution and potential of groundwater and springs and 2 trans boundary aquifers goss 2007 currently groundwater is the main drinking water source in south sudan but almost no work has been done to determine its distribution extraction and quality afdb 2013a salinity fluoride nitrate and sulphate in excess of the permissible limits have been reported in groundwater in some parts of jonglei and unity states making groundwater unsafe for consumption rutten et al 2014 wb 2011 other issues which warrant this research are groundwater quality problems in the oil producing areas including unity and upper nile states as well as around the waste stabilization and oxidation pond in juba city 2 4 access to water despite the sufficient surface and groundwater resources availability millions of people of south sudan do not have access to clean water and sanitation services wb 2011 about half of the population does not have access to an improved water source within a distance of 1 km from their living place in the dry season goss 2007 it has been widely reported that in juba the national capital of south sudan and few other towns only 50 of people have access to clean water and 10 have access to sanitation christiansen and sullivan 2012 in the rural areas 47 have access to clean water and 7 to sanitation 2 5 water infrastructure south sudan was the most deprived and marginalized region of the old sudan the long neglect from the central government coupled with the consequences of the two consecutive civil wars fought during the last five decades caused the region to be devastated and left virtually with either few obsolete or no water infrastructure afdb 2013a goss 2007 rss 2011 after independence many wells and boreholes were constructed as a shortcut to provide safe water for domestic use to its urban and rural population the wells and boreholes constructed after south sudan independence with their depths are reported in the range from 14 to 150 m in lomelto and lofiri villages of magwi and torit counties in eastern equatoria state respectively 14 100 min daplual and nyandong villages of mayendit and panyijiar counties in unity state respectively 12 84 m in abienyi and banken villages of nasir and maban counties of the upper nile state respectively mwri 2011 groundwater from these wells and boreholes has been considered to be safe by the government authorities without any prior water quality assessment thus groundwater quality analysis is urgently needed to determine its suitability for drinking domestic and irrigation purposes anku et al 2009 moreover withdrawal of water from the wells must be linked not only to its quality but also to its level and quantity to allow a better and optimised water resources management without overexploiting the resources wb 2011 the average availability of water per person is estimated at 15 litres capita day in urban areas which is alarmingly lower compared to most urban towns in africa a minimum average of 50 litres capita day rutten et al 2014 insufficient water supply lack of access to improved sanitation services coupled with poor awareness to hygiene mean occurrence of waterborne diseases such as cholera diarrhoea and guinea worm is high rutten et al 2014 guinea worm is transmitted through drinking contaminated and stagnant water afdb 2013a cholera and diarrhoea diseases kill thousands of people in the country every year due to unavailability of safe potable water there were 6421 suspected cases including 167 deaths due to may 2014 cholera outbreak unicef 2015 the frequent diarrhoeal disease incidences occur in south sudnan often associated with lack of access to sanitation and safe water rss 2011 in 2010 a household survey estimated that more than one child in 10 died before completing five years unicef 2015 2 6 recent water policy cognizant of the importance of the safe water for human consumption and irrigation the south sudanese government has gone one step ahead to produce a water policy to provide access to clean water supply and sanitation afdb 2013a in the policy water is considered to be a human right issue and therefore given the highest priority afdb 2013a the policy also stresses the need for investments in urban and rural water supply and sanitation infrastructure rss 2007 the recent development in the water sector in south sudan is outlined in table sm1 however till today a groundwater quality assessment in relation to its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes is missing in south sudan whereas it is considered to be a routine practice in other countries abdellah et al 2013 belkhiri et al 2012 bhoopathi et al 2014 bikundia and mohan 2014 douagui et al 2012 ekwere et al 2012 grimason et al 2013 hagras 2013 hussain et al 2012 jamshidzadeh and mirbagheri 2011 jimmy et

hydrogeological units described for south sudan section 2 3 are found in equatoria state fig 3a the umm ruwaba formation with low to moderate water productivity covers about half of the state where it is found in the northern and south eastern part precambrian basement covers about a third of the state in its southern and western part igneous tertiary volcanic rocks with very low to high aquifer productivity occur in the eastern part of the state and along the rivers quaternary unconsolidated sediments low to high water productivity the main aquifer types in eastern equatoria state are unconsolidated sedimentary rocks of tertiary quaternary umm ruwaba formations and basement rock type aquifer both these aquifers are rain fed and depends on seasonal rainfalls for recharging bgs 2018 the region is also rich in carbonate containing deposits dolomite and marble mpm 2013 2 8 geography livelihoods and ethnicities eastern equatoria is part of the hills and mountains livelihood zone afdb 2013a the state is characterized by different agro ecological zones with a relatively complex mosaic of ecosystems varying in altitude between 440 to 3100 m above mean sea level m a m s l on both the northwest as well as on the southeast axis the corresponding annual rain fall occurs between 800 and 2200 mm on northwest axis and between 600 and 200 mm going to the extreme eastern part of the state kapoeta east county respectively prowas ssn ees 2013 the counties situated on the northwest side of the state e g lopa lafon have large flood plains with seasonal streams flowing in north west direction which mainly dry up during the dry season prowas ssn ees 2013 eastern equatoria state is a home to many ethnic groups such as acholi otuho and toposa most of these ethnicities live on subsistence farming and raising cattle and goats the didinga hills of budi county in particular have a fertile soil which is suitable for maize potatoes tobacco and sclerochloadura a common hard grass cultivation geohive 2014 in the recent past anthropogenic activities have been increased in eastern african countries including south sudan agricultural practices and forest cutting have increased tremendously guzha et al 2018 eastern equatoria is an agricultural intensive state of south sudan with 86 population depending on agriculture afdb 2013b these activities along with increasing groundwater usage by increasing population have put immense pressure on the aquifers guzha et al 2018 approximately 85 population in south sudan defecates openly afdb 2013c unhygienic livelihood and contamination of surface and groundwater sources with human wastes faeces and urine along with other anthropogenic contaminants are also rising every day engström et al 2015 3 material and methods 3 1 study area administratively eastern equatoria state is one of the ten states in south sudan located within the greater equatoria region in the southeast of the country fig 3a it extends from latitudes 3 29 16 to 6 0 2 n and longitudes 31 45 18 to 35 57 44 e the state is surrounded by the jonglei state to the north and the central equatoria state to the west and internationally by ethiopia to the northeast kenya to the southeast uganda to the south the state has a population of 906 161 distributed over an area of 73 472 km2 census 2008 torit is the state capital 3 2 sampling methodology a total of 176 groundwater samples covering both dry and wet seasons were collected from the wells scattered around the eight counties of the eastern equatoria state fig 3b from each county a total of 16 water samples were collected for physicochemical parameter analysis in addition 6 water samples were collected from each county during dry and wet seasons for heavy metal determination the dry season water samples were collected in the month of april and those for wet season in the month of october 2014 all water samples were collected in 1 l pre deionized water washed polyethylene bottles the water samples for heavy metal analyses were collected in pre acid washed ldpe bottles and were preserved by adding few drops of 0 1 n hno3 at the sampling site ph 2 a calibrated gps model garmin 12 was used to record the geographic coordinates latitudes and longitudes of the wells fig 3b table sm2 local state or county authorities were also consulted in the selection of the wells all water

collected from the study area during dry april 2014 and wet october 2014 seasons are presented in table 1 a and b the results are summarized in a form of descriptive statistics including maximum minimum range mean median and standard deviation the percentage of samples exceeding the permissible limits of the south sudan water quality guidelines sswqgs and the who are also included 4 2 physicochemical characteristics of groundwater and its suitability for drinking water quality the ph of the water samples during the dry season ranges between 7 2 and 8 5 mean 7 9 while in the wet season it varies from 6 78 to 8 2 mean 7 5 table 1 a b all the ph values are within the permissible limit of 6 5 8 5 who 1993 and 6 0 8 5 sswqgs 2008 the ec values of the water samples range from 247 6 to 2982 µs cm mean 914 µs cm and 247 7 3910 µs cm mean 1015 3 µs cm during the dry and wet seasons respectively during dry season only 11 and 16 exceeded the who 1400 µs cm and sswqgs 1500 µs cm permissible limits respectively table 1 a b during wet season 19 samples exceeded the who and sswqgs permissible limits table 1 a b the tds values varied from 121 to 1467 mg l mean 449 mg l and 121 1923 mg l mean 515 mg l during dry and wet seasons respectively table 1 a b about 3 and 19 of dry season samples exceeded the sswqgs 1000 mg l and who 600 mg l limits similarly 6 and 23 of wet season samples exceed the sswqgs and who desirable limits table 1 a b water alkalinity varies from 30 to 760 mg l as caco3 mean 321 mg l during dry season and 140 3990 mg l as caco3 mean 1706 3 mg l in wet

98 samples and who 94 samples standards fig 4 a b shows the spatial distribution of alkalinity during dry and wet seasons in eastern equatoria the central western and north eastern regions of the state show an increase in alkalinity in wet season samples fig 4 b since majority of groundwater is controlled by rock water interaction during dry and wet seasons high groundwater alkalinity may be due to groundwater interactions with caco3 mgco3 and ca hco3 2 mg hco3 2 type rocks these carbonate rocks may initiate geochemical transformations resulting into an increase in groundwater alkalinity krainov et al 2001 these results suggest that groundwater in the study area is characterized by high buffering capacity during the wet season table 1 a b since the aquifers in study area are rich in dolomite and other carbonate rich rock deposits and are rainfed mpm 2013 the stormwater during wet season may enrich groundwater with carbonate and enhance its alkalinity bicarbonate varies from 68 3 to 224 5 mg l mean 122 8 mg l and negligible to 866 2 mg l mean 321 4 mg l during dry and wet seasons respectively table 1 a b groundwater bicarbonate suggests release from biogenic and mineral sources bikundia and mohan 2014 younger 2007 bicarbonate biogenic formation takes place due to co2 released by plant roots into the soil is used by the soil microbes thus it is degraded into an organic matter and bicarbonate is formed as a by product bicarbonate could also be formed by co2 dissolution directly into the soil water younger 2007 carbonate varies from 25 3 to 178 mg l mean 47 2 mg l and negligible to 320 4 mg l mean 118 9 mg l during dry and wet season periods respectively table 1 a b nitrate sulphate phosphate and silicates were all within the who and sswqgs permissible

the groundwater samples are hard 200 300 mg l as caco3 to very hard 300 mg l as caco3 in both the seasons table 1 a b very hard to hard water develops scale in water heaters distribution pipes and also consumes more soap table 1 a b thus from an aesthetic and practical view point these samples are unsuitable for drinking 4 2 1 anion chemistry anion concentrations of the groundwater samples are summarized in table 1 a b chloride concentration varies from 450 to 4848 mg l mean 1018 6 mg l and 130 7378 mg l mean 784 mg l during dry and wet seasons respectively table 1 a b almost 100 of dry

indicates groundwater contamination due to both anthropogenic and natural sources bikundia and mohan 2014 release of chloride into the groundwater may also be through ion exchange processes bikundia and mohan 2014 drever 1997 previously high anthropogenic contamination in the region was reported engström et al 2015 thus increased contamination could be due to high anthropogenic activities about 9 and 22 of dry season samples exceed the who and sswqgs permissible fluoride limits of 1 5 and 1 mg l respectively about 69 of wet season samples exceed the sswqgs permissible limit of 1 0 mg l table 1 a b as there are no fluoride emitting industries in the study area fluoride contamination is due to geogenic origin as e g the volcanic rocks present in parts of the study area the high fluoride concentrations exceeding the regulatory limits in drinking water may cause dental and skeletal fluorosis bundschuh et al 2017 singh et al 2012 for a tropical country such as south sudan excess fluoride in the water can economically be remediated at household scale using pottery water containers made of tropical soil rich in calcium and aluminium oxides fawell et al 2006 other locally available biosorbents can also be considered for fluoride remediation 4 2 2 cation chemistry calcium magnesium sodium and potassium were determined in groundwater samples groundwater calcium

surpass the sswqgs 25 50 mg l and who 12 mg l limits respectively table 1 a b application of potash fertilizer and potash silicate weathering may be considered as source for high potassium in groundwater jain et al 2010 magnesium varies from 19 1 to 2286 2 mg l mean 393 mg l and from 15 2 to 114 3 mg l mean 47 9 mg l during dry and wet seasons respectively table 1 a b about 96 of dry season samples exceed the permissible limits of who 30 mg l and sswqgs 30 70 mg l during wet season period 13 86 violated the who 30 mg l and sswqgs 30 70 mg l limits respectively table 1 a b heavy metals in an aquatic environment in general and groundwater in particular are progressively becoming a health concern due to their toxicity and bioaccumulation bikundia and mohan 2014 heavy metals are introduced into the environment by both anthropogenic and geogenic activities geogenic sources include rock weathering and artificially by sewage discharge industrial effluent and unplanned waste disposal cpcb 2008 iron cadmium copper lead chromium nickel and zinc concentrations determined in the groundwater samples are given in table 1 a b ni2 crt zn2 and cu2 were within the permissible

samples and 92 of wet season samples surpassed who and sswqgs permissible limit of 0 01 mg l table 1 a b 4 2 3 hydrochemical characteristics and hydrogeological processes 4 2 3 1 piper diagram the concentrations of major cations and anions were plotted into the piper diagram fig 5 the piper diagram shows that strong acidic anions cl so4 2 dominate over weak acid anions hco3 in dry and wet seasons samples water chemistry is significantly different in dry and wet seasons in dry season the water chemistry was uniform in the piper diagram almost all groundwater samples were of magnesium chloride type 80 chloride and magnesium respectively in all samples permanent hardness exceeds temporary hardness however in the wet season water samples show a much larger scattering in the piper diagram the important hydrochemical facies include ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 followed by ca2 mg2 hco3 and na k cl so4 2 this wider scattering in the wet season may be due to the rainfall including infiltration via surface bodies influences the groundwater chemistry in various ways depending on aquifer type unconfined or confined unconsolidated hard rock and fracturing grade depth to groundwater table which is highly variable in the project area 14 150 m material composition and permeability of the unsaturated zone rainfall variability and presence of anthropogenic contaminants the individual importance of different influences cannot be determined due to lack of data 4 2 3 2 gibbs plot the gibbs diagrams total dissolved solids versus relative cation abundances i e tds versus na na ca2 and total dissolved solids versus relative anion abundance i e tds versus cl cl hco3 obtained in dry and wet seasons are shown in fig 6a and b respectively the gibbs diagrams clearly show that groundwater chemistry of majority of samples is mainly controlled by evaporation during dry season whereas rock water interaction governs the chemistry during wet season fig 6 a b however chemistry of few samples is governed by evaporation process in both the seasons fig 6 a b thus weathering and mineralization may be considered as major factors in the groundwater chemical composition evolution furthermore an increase in tds due to increase in cl and na concentrations indicate that anthropogenic activities are also contributing to the chemical evolution in the selected study area 4 2 3 3 base exchange indices groundwater classification using base exchange index r1 are summarized in table 2 about 95 and 5 of the collected groundwater samples are classified as na so4 2 type r1 1 and na hco3 type r1 1 in both dry and wet seasons respectively table 2 4 2 3 4 meteoric genesis indices meteoric genesis indices values are recorded in table 2 about 95 water samples in the study area correspond to deep meteoric water percolation r2 1 while 5 samples belong to shallow meteoric water percolation r2 1 in dry and wet seasons respectively table 2 4 3 groundwater quality evaluation for irrigation purposes groundwater suitability for irrigation was determined using degree of its acidity or alkalinity sodium percentage na sodium adsorption ratio sar and its relation to ec residual sodium carbonate rsc kelli index magnesium ratio and permeability index pi groundwater samples rating based on electrical conductivity ec and na are shown in fig 7 4 3 1 salinity index groundwater samples were classified based on their ec values within a six class ranking system according to their suitability for irrigation table sm3 only 2 water samples dry and wet seasons are characterized as class i which can be used for irrigation to all plants without any problem about 52 samples in dry season and 47 samples in wet season are characterized as class ii which can additionally be used for very low salt tolerant crops about 5 in dry season and 4 in wet season samples are characterized as high class iii and very high class 4 salinity thus these water samples can only be used on high salt tolerant crops and may not be used for long term irrigation purposes due to salinization hazard for soils 4 3 2 chlorinity index groundwater samples were classified based on their chloride concentrations within a five class ranking system according to their suitability for irrigation table sm5 figure sm1 no dry season sample and 54 wet season samples are categorized as class i and fit for all types of crops about 69 of dry season and 23 of wet season samples are categorized as class ii water fit for high medium low salt tolerant crops about 3 13 and 15 in dry season and 3 9 and 11 during wet season samples are categorized as class iii fit for high medium low salt tolerant crops class iv only fit for high salt tolerant crops and class v not fit for any plant respectively majority of the groundwater samples are categorized as class i during dry season and class ii during wet season and therefore suitable for irrigation in the study area 4 3 3 sodicity index or alkalinity hazards the sodicity indices were also calculated to classify water samples regarding their plant toxicity and hazard for deteriorating soil characteristic table sm6 figure sm2 most of groundwater samples in both the seasons fall in class i i e no sodium problem and only a few samples 5 fall in class ii i e few problems except with sodium sensitive crops 4 3 4 residual sodium carbonate rsc groundwater values during the dry and wet seasons are given in figure sm3 during dry season all water samples having rsc 1 25 meq l fall under the safe category and can be considered for irrigation figure sm3 table 3 on the other hand only 38 17 and 45 of wet season samples are considered to be safe marginally safe and unsuitable for irrigation purposes respectively figure sm3 4 3 5 the us salinity laboratory s diagram groundwater sample data were also plotted into the us salinity laboratory ussl diagram characterizing the combined effects of sodium i e undesirable ion exchange effects in the soil classes s1 s4 and salinity hazards classes c1 c4 for irrigation purposes fig 7 a b table 4 in the dry and wet season 98 and 92 or the samples are categorized as low alkali hazard s1 falling in the fields of medium c2s1and high salinity c3s1 only a few samples have very high salinity and low medium and high very high sodium hazard c4s1 c4s2 c4s3 c4s4 in dry season water samples collected from hai el shaggal torit county hiyala hiyala payam and mawanga boma chorokol payam during dry and wet seasons have very high salinity hazard fig 8 a b in addition few samples show high salinity and medium sodium hazards c3s2 high salinity and high sodium hazards c3s3 high salinity and very high sodium hazards c3s4 and very high salinity and very high sodium hazards c4s4 these include water samples collected from torit county 3 5 kudo payam 6 and 7 nimule payam 25 and 26 kapoeta south county 28 30 paringa payam 36 riwoto town 39 42 nadapal payam 43 narus town 44 46 budi county 51 nakuwa chukudum town 55 ikwotos county ikwotos town 57 64 during dry season fig 8 a in addition water samples collected from hai metaar torit county 2 lafon school 13 lafon mission lafon 15 malekia east nimule payam 27 katiko payam 35 chumakori 38 and lopodopod payam 48 fall under high salinity hazard fig 8 b thus the groundwater salinity is widely distributed in ten counties of eastern equatoria the predominance of water samples falling in c2s1and c3s1 indicates low sodium hazard and medium to high salinity hazards being suitable for irrigation 4 3 6 wilcox diagram according to the wilcox diagrams fig 9 a b table 5 about 75 and 11 of the groundwater samples are categorized as excellent 20 and 53 as good to permissible 5 and 23 as permissible to doubtful negligible and 11 as doubtful to unsuitable for irrigation during dry and wet seasons respectively fig 9 a b water samples collected from hai el sheggal torit county 1 hiyalla hiyala payam 8 ikwotos idwele ikwotos county 61 and mawanga boma chorokul payam were doubtful to unsuitable during dry season fig 10 a in addition water quality of atabpakori rowoto town 41 was unsuitable for irrigation fig 10 b majority of groundwater samples fall under categories of excellent to good and good to permissible in dry and wet seasons respectively these results clearly demonstartae that the majority of the water samples are suitable for irrigation from percent sodium view point 4 3 7 kelly index in both the seasons majority large number of the water samples in the study area fall within the ki 1 class making 100 of the waters suitable for irrigation in the dry and wet seasons respectively 4 3 8 magnesium ratio about 87 of dry season samples and 77 of wet season samples have a magnesium ratio of 50 and hence are not suitable for irrigation purposes since its use adversely affects crop yields through increasing soil structure 4 3 9 permeability index the majority of the water samples fall in the pi category iii of 25 during dry and wet seasons based on permeability index greater number of water samples are unsuitable for irrigation use of these samples will further reduce soil permeability due to dominance of na mg2 and ca2 versus na hco3 4 3 10 chloro alkaline index 5 of dry and wet season samples show negative values thereby indicating base exchange reactions rest of the dry and wet season samples 95 of show positive values thereby categorized as cation anion reaction type 5 conclusions the groundwater quality in the south sudan s eastern equatoria state was assessed for its suitability for drinking domestic and irrigation purposes a total of 176 groundwater samples were collected during the dry and wet seasons of 2014 from the eight counties of the state and analysed for 27 physicochemical water quality parameters the ph values of the water samples in both the dry and wet seasons were within the permissible limits a number of samples exceeded the who permissible limits set for ec tds talk th cl during dry and wet seasons concentrations of so4 2 sio2 and po4 3 were within the permissible limits of who and sswqgs only 5 in dry and 6 in wet seasons crossed the no3 permissible limit furthermore 9 and 22 dry season samples violated the fluoride permissible limits of 1 5 who and 1 0 mg l sswqgs during wet season 69 samples were unsafe as per sswqgs fluoride desirable limit calcium and sodium concentrations were within the limit as set by who and sswqgs hai el shaggal torit county hiyala hiyala payam and mawanga boma chorokol payam regions had high salinity problem hai el sheggal torit county hiyalla hiyala payam ikwotos idwele ikwotos county mawanga boma chorokul payam atabpakori rowoto town water quality was unsuitable for irrigation the central western and north eastern regions of the state showed high alkalinity in wet season samples since majority of groundwater is controlled by rock water interaction during dry and wet season high alkalinity in groundwater could be attributed to interactions of caco3 mgco3 and ca hco3 2 mg hco3 2 type rocks with groundwater based on the above observations it is highly recommended that sustainable development of the groundwater is necessary in and around study area as well as in the entire south sudan it is necessary to identify wells where groundwater sources are sufficient in quantity and able to meet the demands macdonald et al 2009 wells must be protected from anthropogenic sources which may lead to contamination institutional capacity building in the area and the whole nation capable of assessing chemical and microbiological water quality is provided low cost treatment technologies including biochar geological materials etc may be considered depending on specific local conditions

12285,south sudan the world s newest nation is bestowed with huge fresh water resources however water resources management in south sudan is lacking in water quality monitoring data and comprehensive plans of action for sustainable water resources development groundwater resources in particular have been exploited for domestic and irrigation use versus surface water however this groundwater withdrawal has not been monitored for its level and quality to overcome this deficit groundwater major ion chemistry in the south sudan s eastern equatoria state was evaluated to determine its suitability for drinking domestic and irrigation purposes a total of 176 groundwater samples were collected during wet october 2014 and dry april 2014 seasons sampling points were spread around the eight counties of eastern equatoria twenty two water samples were collected from each county the samples were analysed for various physicochemical parameters including alkalinity calcium hardness conductivity ph salinity tds total hardness na k ca2 mg2 ba2 crt cd2 cu2 fet ni2 zn2 pb2 no3 cl f so4 2 po4 3 and sio2 groundwater irrigation quality indices including chlorinity index kelli index magnesium ratio percentage of sodium must be replaced by sodium percentage na permeability index pi residual sodium carbonate rsc salinity index sodicity index and sodium absorption ratio sar were calculated to determine the groundwater suitability for agricultural uses the results were compared with south sudan water quality guidelines sswqgs and the who standards most of the water quality parameters met the who standards and sswqgs prescribed for drinking and domestic purposes the calculated irrigation water quality indices indicated the water suitability for irrigation graphical abstract fx1 keywords south sudan groundwater water quality assessment major ion chemistry sustainable development goals 1 introduction south sudan became an independent country from sudan on 9th july 2011 after five decades of civil war that had devastated not only the lives and livelihoods of the south sudanese people but also their access to basic needs including safe water afdb 2013a south sudan is now facing tremendous challenges to meet the 2030 sustainable development goals sdgs formulated in 2015 as the 2030 agenda through water as key to sustainable development to overcome poverty hunger gender inequity and other adverse impacts wb 2011 as the corresponding data from south sudan show http southsudan opendataforafrica org apps gallery each of the 17 formulated goals will be a big challenge to achieve wb 2011 to begin with safe water provision is the fundamental key the water topic is not only covered by goal 6 clean water and sanitation but also included in goal 3 good health and well being goal 10 fight injustice and inequality and goals 14 and 15 protecting life in aquatic systems and on land respectively provision of chemically safe water enhances food security contributing to goals 1 and 2 eradicating or reducing hunger and poverty and to goal 5 gender equality reducing the discrimination of girls and women obliged to walk long distances for collecting water furthermore access to safe water and sanitation enhances job creation contributing to achieve goal 8 economic growth and decent work and goal 9 innovation infrastructure and industry including water and sanitation infrastructure in view of the above sustained development in the country will very much depend on secure access to its substantial water resources wb 2011 thus in the first part of the paper water availability and supply situation in south sudan is reviewed in the second part groundwater suitability in the south sudan s eastern equatoria state for drinking and irrigation purposes is discussed to the best of our knowledge for the first time groundwater chemical composition and variability in space and time are studied to establish a reliable database this will assist the decision and policy makers in providing safe drinking water and basic sanitation at household level this study will contribute in establishing a reliable water quality database for a proper development management and protection of ground and surface water resources for sustainable development on the country s way to meet the sdgs wrc 2008 2 key water issues and challenges in south sudan 2 1 water availability and supply situation in south sudan south sudan s renewable surface and groundwater resources stand at 49 5 km3 year afdb 2013a rainfall in the country is high with highland parts of eastern equatoria in the southern part and western equatoria receiving an annual rainfall between 1200 and 2200 mm fig 1 the lowland areas of bahr el ghazal eastern equatoria jonglei and upper nile receive annual rainfall between 700 and 1300 mm wb 2011 2 2 surface water resources the white nile river which has its three main tributaries of bahr el ghazal the three sub basins of jur kiir and loll the bahr el jebel tributaries aswa kiit and yei and the river sobat sub basins of pibor and akobo run from the south to north through the country in addition the country has the second world s largest swamp the sudd which covers 30 000 km2 which has many lakes and which is located on the bahr el jebel river this swamp area has been declared a ramsar site there are other wetland systems along the bahr el ghazal and the river sobat tributaries afdb 2013a all the wetlands comprise 7 of the total area of south sudan south sudan comprises 20 of the total nile river basin area afdb 2013a respectively despite these huge freshwater resources surface water is scarce during the dry season in areas that are not located on the river banks or where some of the tributaries dry up during the dry season 2 3 groundwater resources south sudan possesses large areas of land underlain by rich aquifers five main geological and respective hydrogeological units can be distinguished in south sudan fig 2 persits et al 2002 wb 2011 tertiary quaternary umm ruwaba formation found in most of the greater upper nile region and part of the eastern equatoria state its unconsolidated sediments seasonal rainfall and river floods predominantly recharge its aquifers and in some parts extend across international boundaries constitute aquifers with low to moderate water productivity quaternary unconsolidated sediments in the western and eastern flood plains of rivers in jonglei lakes and unity states with low to high water productivity of aquifers tertiary igneous volcanic rocks in eastern equatoria state and the adjacent part of jonglei state with a very variable water productivity ranging from very low to high cretaceous nubian sandstone formation in northern bahr el gazal state and part of gokrial state with intergranular sedimentary aquifers of low to high productivity precambrian basement in part of the central equatoria whole of western equatoria and western bahr el gazal states with low water productivity in this zone search for groundwater focuses on fractured and weathered zones however little is known regarding recharge aquifer connectivity and the relation between surface water bodies and groundwater which would be particularly important in the case of the umm ruwaba formation and the overlying surface water bodies particularly in the swamps zones demanding more information to establish water balances as base for a sustainable groundwater resources management further there is a need to explore 1 the distribution and potential of groundwater and springs and 2 trans boundary aquifers goss 2007 currently groundwater is the main drinking water source in south sudan but almost no work has been done to determine its distribution extraction and quality afdb 2013a salinity fluoride nitrate and sulphate in excess of the permissible limits have been reported in groundwater in some parts of jonglei and unity states making groundwater unsafe for consumption rutten et al 2014 wb 2011 other issues which warrant this research are groundwater quality problems in the oil producing areas including unity and upper nile states as well as around the waste stabilization and oxidation pond in juba city 2 4 access to water despite the sufficient surface and groundwater resources availability millions of people of south sudan do not have access to clean water and sanitation services wb 2011 about half of the population does not have access to an improved water source within a distance of 1 km from their living place in the dry season goss 2007 it has been widely reported that in juba the national capital of south sudan and few other towns only 50 of people have access to clean water and 10 have access to sanitation christiansen and sullivan 2012 in the rural areas 47 have access to clean water and 7 to sanitation 2 5 water infrastructure south sudan was the most deprived and marginalized region of the old sudan the long neglect from the central government coupled with the consequences of the two consecutive civil wars fought during the last five decades caused the region to be devastated and left virtually with either few obsolete or no water infrastructure afdb 2013a goss 2007 rss 2011 after independence many wells and boreholes were constructed as a shortcut to provide safe water for domestic use to its urban and rural population the wells and boreholes constructed after south sudan independence with their depths are reported in the range from 14 to 150 m in lomelto and lofiri villages of magwi and torit counties in eastern equatoria state respectively 14 100 min daplual and nyandong villages of mayendit and panyijiar counties in unity state respectively 12 84 m in abienyi and banken villages of nasir and maban counties of the upper nile state respectively mwri 2011 groundwater from these wells and boreholes has been considered to be safe by the government authorities without any prior water quality assessment thus groundwater quality analysis is urgently needed to determine its suitability for drinking domestic and irrigation purposes anku et al 2009 moreover withdrawal of water from the wells must be linked not only to its quality but also to its level and quantity to allow a better and optimised water resources management without overexploiting the resources wb 2011 the average availability of water per person is estimated at 15 litres capita day in urban areas which is alarmingly lower compared to most urban towns in africa a minimum average of 50 litres capita day rutten et al 2014 insufficient water supply lack of access to improved sanitation services coupled with poor awareness to hygiene mean occurrence of waterborne diseases such as cholera diarrhoea and guinea worm is high rutten et al 2014 guinea worm is transmitted through drinking contaminated and stagnant water afdb 2013a cholera and diarrhoea diseases kill thousands of people in the country every year due to unavailability of safe potable water there were 6421 suspected cases including 167 deaths due to may 2014 cholera outbreak unicef 2015 the frequent diarrhoeal disease incidences occur in south sudnan often associated with lack of access to sanitation and safe water rss 2011 in 2010 a household survey estimated that more than one child in 10 died before completing five years unicef 2015 2 6 recent water policy cognizant of the importance of the safe water for human consumption and irrigation the south sudanese government has gone one step ahead to produce a water policy to provide access to clean water supply and sanitation afdb 2013a in the policy water is considered to be a human right issue and therefore given the highest priority afdb 2013a the policy also stresses the need for investments in urban and rural water supply and sanitation infrastructure rss 2007 the recent development in the water sector in south sudan is outlined in table sm1 however till today a groundwater quality assessment in relation to its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes is missing in south sudan whereas it is considered to be a routine practice in other countries abdellah et al 2013 belkhiri et al 2012 bhoopathi et al 2014 bikundia and mohan 2014 douagui et al 2012 ekwere et al 2012 grimason et al 2013 hagras 2013 hussain et al 2012 jamshidzadeh and mirbagheri 2011 jimmy et

hydrogeological units described for south sudan section 2 3 are found in equatoria state fig 3a the umm ruwaba formation with low to moderate water productivity covers about half of the state where it is found in the northern and south eastern part precambrian basement covers about a third of the state in its southern and western part igneous tertiary volcanic rocks with very low to high aquifer productivity occur in the eastern part of the state and along the rivers quaternary unconsolidated sediments low to high water productivity the main aquifer types in eastern equatoria state are unconsolidated sedimentary rocks of tertiary quaternary umm ruwaba formations and basement rock type aquifer both these aquifers are rain fed and depends on seasonal rainfalls for recharging bgs 2018 the region is also rich in carbonate containing deposits dolomite and marble mpm 2013 2 8 geography livelihoods and ethnicities eastern equatoria is part of the hills and mountains livelihood zone afdb 2013a the state is characterized by different agro ecological zones with a relatively complex mosaic of ecosystems varying in altitude between 440 to 3100 m above mean sea level m a m s l on both the northwest as well as on the southeast axis the corresponding annual rain fall occurs between 800 and 2200 mm on northwest axis and between 600 and 200 mm going to the extreme eastern part of the state kapoeta east county respectively prowas ssn ees 2013 the counties situated on the northwest side of the state e g lopa lafon have large flood plains with seasonal streams flowing in north west direction which mainly dry up during the dry season prowas ssn ees 2013 eastern equatoria state is a home to many ethnic groups such as acholi otuho and toposa most of these ethnicities live on subsistence farming and raising cattle and goats the didinga hills of budi county in particular have a fertile soil which is suitable for maize potatoes tobacco and sclerochloadura a common hard grass cultivation geohive 2014 in the recent past anthropogenic activities have been increased in eastern african countries including south sudan agricultural practices and forest cutting have increased tremendously guzha et al 2018 eastern equatoria is an agricultural intensive state of south sudan with 86 population depending on agriculture afdb 2013b these activities along with increasing groundwater usage by increasing population have put immense pressure on the aquifers guzha et al 2018 approximately 85 population in south sudan defecates openly afdb 2013c unhygienic livelihood and contamination of surface and groundwater sources with human wastes faeces and urine along with other anthropogenic contaminants are also rising every day engström et al 2015 3 material and methods 3 1 study area administratively eastern equatoria state is one of the ten states in south sudan located within the greater equatoria region in the southeast of the country fig 3a it extends from latitudes 3 29 16 to 6 0 2 n and longitudes 31 45 18 to 35 57 44 e the state is surrounded by the jonglei state to the north and the central equatoria state to the west and internationally by ethiopia to the northeast kenya to the southeast uganda to the south the state has a population of 906 161 distributed over an area of 73 472 km2 census 2008 torit is the state capital 3 2 sampling methodology a total of 176 groundwater samples covering both dry and wet seasons were collected from the wells scattered around the eight counties of the eastern equatoria state fig 3b from each county a total of 16 water samples were collected for physicochemical parameter analysis in addition 6 water samples were collected from each county during dry and wet seasons for heavy metal determination the dry season water samples were collected in the month of april and those for wet season in the month of october 2014 all water samples were collected in 1 l pre deionized water washed polyethylene bottles the water samples for heavy metal analyses were collected in pre acid washed ldpe bottles and were preserved by adding few drops of 0 1 n hno3 at the sampling site ph 2 a calibrated gps model garmin 12 was used to record the geographic coordinates latitudes and longitudes of the wells fig 3b table sm2 local state or county authorities were also consulted in the selection of the wells all water samples were labelled and stored in ice boxes these samples were then transported to the laboratory school of environmental sciences jawaharlal nehru university new delhi india for further analysis 3

collected from the study area during dry april 2014 and wet october 2014 seasons are presented in table 1 a and b the results are summarized in a form of descriptive statistics including maximum minimum range mean median and standard deviation the percentage of samples exceeding the permissible limits of the south sudan water quality guidelines sswqgs and the who are also included 4 2 physicochemical characteristics of groundwater and its suitability for drinking water quality the ph of the water samples during the dry season ranges between 7 2 and 8 5 mean 7 9 while in the wet season it varies from 6 78 to 8 2 mean 7 5 table 1 a b all the ph values are within the permissible limit of 6 5 8 5 who 1993 and 6 0 8 5 sswqgs 2008 the ec values of the water samples range from 247

98 samples and who 94 samples standards fig 4 a b shows the spatial distribution of alkalinity during dry and wet seasons in eastern equatoria the central western and north eastern regions of the state show an increase in alkalinity in wet season samples fig 4 b since majority of groundwater is controlled by rock water interaction during dry and wet seasons high groundwater alkalinity may be due to groundwater interactions with caco3 mgco3 and ca hco3 2 mg hco3 2 type rocks these carbonate rocks may initiate geochemical transformations resulting into an increase in groundwater alkalinity krainov et al 2001 these results suggest that groundwater in the study area is characterized by high buffering capacity during the wet season table 1 a b since the aquifers in study area are rich in dolomite and other carbonate rich rock deposits and are rainfed mpm 2013 the stormwater during wet season may enrich groundwater with carbonate and enhance its alkalinity bicarbonate varies from 68 3

sources bikundia and mohan 2014 younger 2007 bicarbonate biogenic formation takes place due to co2 released by plant roots into the soil is used by the soil microbes thus it is degraded into an organic matter and bicarbonate is formed as a by product bicarbonate could also be formed by co2 dissolution directly into the soil water younger 2007 carbonate varies from 25 3 to 178 mg l mean 47 2

and mohan 2014 drever 1997 previously high anthropogenic contamination in the region was reported engström et al 2015 thus increased contamination could be due to high anthropogenic activities about 9 and 22 of dry season samples exceed the who and sswqgs permissible fluoride limits of 1 5 and 1 mg l respectively about 69 of wet season samples exceed the sswqgs permissible limit of 1 0 mg l table 1 a b as there are no fluoride emitting industries in the study area fluoride contamination is due to geogenic origin as e g the volcanic rocks present in parts of the study area the high fluoride concentrations exceeding the regulatory limits in drinking water may cause dental and skeletal fluorosis bundschuh et al 2017 singh et al 2012 for a tropical country such as south sudan excess fluoride in the water can economically be remediated at household scale using pottery water containers made of tropical soil rich in calcium and aluminium oxides fawell et al 2006 other locally available biosorbents can also be considered for fluoride remediation 4 2 2 cation chemistry calcium magnesium sodium and potassium were determined in groundwater samples groundwater calcium

a b potassium varies from negligible to 34 6 mg l mean 10 mg l and 3 3 151 mg l mean 9 2 mg l during dry and wet season periods respectively table 1 a b about 20 of dry and 2 5 of wet seasons samples surpass the sswqgs 25 50 mg l and who 12 mg l limits respectively table 1 a b application of potash fertilizer and potash silicate weathering may be considered as source for high potassium in groundwater jain et al 2010 magnesium varies from 19 1 to 2286 2 mg l mean 393 mg l and from 15 2 to 114 3 mg l mean 47 9 mg l during dry and wet seasons respectively table 1 a b about 96 of dry season samples exceed the permissible limits of who 30 mg l and sswqgs 30 70 mg l during wet season period 13 86 violated the who 30 mg l and sswqgs 30 70 mg l limits respectively table 1 a b heavy metals in an aquatic environment in general and groundwater in particular are progressively becoming a health concern due to their toxicity and bioaccumulation bikundia and mohan 2014 heavy metals are introduced into the environment by both anthropogenic and geogenic activities geogenic sources include rock weathering and artificially by sewage discharge industrial effluent and unplanned waste disposal cpcb 2008 iron cadmium copper lead chromium nickel and zinc concentrations determined in the groundwater samples are given in table 1 a b ni2 crt zn2 and cu2 were within the permissible limits set by both the sswqgs and who table 1 a b however fet pb2 and cd2 concentrations exceed the permissible limits in dry and wet season periods iron concentrations vary from 0 02 to 3 6 mg l mean

fu and wang 2011 in the study area the iron presence in water is mainly due to dissolution from minerals and rocks locally landfill leachate and sewage may be also considered as additional

concentrations of major cations and anions were plotted into the piper diagram fig 5 the piper diagram shows that strong acidic anions cl so4 2 dominate over weak acid anions hco3 in dry and wet seasons samples water chemistry is significantly different in dry and wet seasons in dry season the water chemistry was uniform in the piper diagram almost all groundwater samples were of magnesium chloride type 80 chloride and magnesium respectively in all samples permanent hardness exceeds temporary hardness however in the wet season water samples show a much larger scattering in the piper diagram the important hydrochemical facies include ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 followed by ca2 mg2 hco3 and na k cl so4 2 this wider scattering in the wet season may be due to the rainfall including infiltration via surface bodies influences the groundwater chemistry in various ways depending on aquifer type unconfined or confined unconsolidated hard rock and fracturing grade depth to groundwater table which is highly variable in the project area 14 150 m material composition and permeability of the unsaturated zone rainfall variability and presence of anthropogenic contaminants the individual importance of different influences cannot be determined due to lack of data 4 2 3 2 gibbs plot the gibbs diagrams total dissolved solids versus relative cation abundances i e tds versus na na ca2 and total dissolved solids versus relative anion abundance i e tds versus cl cl hco3 obtained in dry and wet seasons are shown in fig 6a and b respectively the gibbs diagrams clearly show that groundwater chemistry of majority of samples is mainly controlled by evaporation during dry season whereas rock water interaction governs the chemistry during wet season fig 6 a b however chemistry of few samples is governed by evaporation process in both the seasons fig 6 a b thus weathering and mineralization may be considered as major factors in the groundwater chemical composition evolution furthermore an increase in tds due to increase in cl and na concentrations indicate that anthropogenic activities are also contributing to the chemical evolution in the selected study area 4 2 3 3 base exchange indices groundwater classification using base exchange index r1 are summarized in table 2 about 95 and 5 of the collected groundwater samples are classified as na so4 2 type r1 1 and na hco3 type r1 1 in both dry and wet seasons respectively table 2 4 2 3 4 meteoric genesis indices meteoric genesis indices values are recorded in table 2 about 95 water samples in the study area correspond to deep

kelli index magnesium ratio and permeability index pi groundwater samples rating based on electrical conductivity ec and na are shown in fig 7 4 3 1 salinity index groundwater samples were classified based on their ec values within a six class ranking system according to their suitability for irrigation table sm3 only 2 water samples dry and wet seasons are characterized as class i which can be used for irrigation to all plants without any problem about 52 samples in dry season and 47 samples in wet season are characterized as class ii which can additionally be used for very low salt tolerant crops about 5 in dry season and 4 in wet season samples are characterized as high class iii and very high class 4 salinity thus these water samples can only be used on high salt tolerant crops and may not be used for long term irrigation purposes due to salinization hazard for soils 4 3 2 chlorinity index groundwater samples were classified based on their chloride concentrations within a five class ranking system according to their suitability for irrigation table sm5 figure sm1 no dry season sample and 54 wet season samples are categorized as class i and fit for all types of crops about 69 of dry season and 23 of wet season samples are categorized as class ii water fit for high medium low salt tolerant crops about 3 13 and 15 in dry season and 3 9 and 11 during wet season samples are categorized as class iii fit for high medium low salt tolerant crops class iv only fit for high salt tolerant crops and class v not fit for any plant respectively majority of the groundwater samples are categorized as class i during dry season and class ii during wet season and therefore suitable for irrigation in the study area 4 3 3 sodicity index or alkalinity hazards the sodicity indices were also calculated to classify water samples regarding their plant toxicity and hazard for deteriorating soil characteristic table sm6 figure sm2 most of groundwater samples in both the seasons fall in class i i e no sodium problem and only a few samples 5 fall in class ii i e few problems except with sodium sensitive crops 4 3 4 residual sodium carbonate rsc groundwater values during the dry and wet seasons are given in figure sm3 during dry season all water samples having rsc 1 25 meq l fall under the safe category and can be considered for irrigation figure sm3 table 3 on the other hand only 38 17 and 45 of wet season samples are considered to be safe marginally safe and unsuitable for irrigation purposes respectively figure sm3 4 3 5 the us salinity laboratory s

shaggal torit county hiyala hiyala payam and mawanga boma chorokol payam during dry and wet seasons have very high salinity hazard fig 8 a b in addition few samples show high salinity and medium sodium hazards c3s2 high salinity and high sodium hazards c3s3 high salinity and very high sodium hazards c3s4 and very high salinity and very high sodium hazards c4s4 these include water samples collected from torit county 3 5 kudo payam 6 and 7 nimule payam 25 and 26 kapoeta south county 28 30 paringa payam 36 riwoto town 39 42 nadapal payam 43 narus town 44 46 budi county 51 nakuwa chukudum

27 katiko payam 35 chumakori 38 and lopodopod payam 48 fall under high salinity hazard fig 8 b thus the groundwater salinity is widely distributed in ten counties of eastern equatoria the predominance of water samples falling in c2s1and c3s1 indicates low sodium hazard and medium to high salinity hazards being suitable for irrigation 4 3 6 wilcox diagram according to the wilcox diagrams fig 9 a b table 5 about 75 and 11 of the groundwater samples are categorized as excellent 20 and 53 as good to permissible 5 and 23 as permissible to doubtful negligible and 11 as doubtful to unsuitable for irrigation during dry and wet seasons respectively fig 9 a b water samples collected from hai el sheggal torit county 1 hiyalla hiyala payam 8 ikwotos idwele ikwotos county 61 and mawanga boma chorokul payam were doubtful to unsuitable during dry season fig 10 a in addition water quality of atabpakori rowoto town 41 was unsuitable for irrigation fig 10 b majority of groundwater samples fall under categories of excellent to good and good to permissible in dry and wet seasons respectively these results clearly demonstartae that the majority of the water samples are suitable for irrigation from percent sodium view point 4 3 7 kelly index in both the seasons majority large number of the water samples in the study area fall within the ki 1 class making 100 of the waters suitable for irrigation in the dry and wet seasons respectively 4 3 8 magnesium ratio about 87 of dry season samples and 77 of wet season samples have a magnesium ratio of 50 and hence are not suitable for irrigation purposes since its use adversely affects crop yields through increasing soil structure 4 3 9 permeability index the majority of the water samples fall in the pi category iii of 25 during dry and wet seasons based on permeability index greater number of water samples are unsuitable for irrigation use of these samples will further reduce soil permeability due to dominance of na mg2 and ca2 versus na hco3 4 3 10 chloro alkaline index 5 of dry and wet season samples show negative values thereby indicating base exchange reactions rest of the dry and wet season samples 95 of show positive values thereby categorized as cation anion reaction type 5 conclusions the groundwater quality in the south sudan s eastern equatoria state was assessed for its suitability for drinking domestic and irrigation purposes a total of 176 groundwater samples were collected during the dry and wet seasons of 2014 from the eight counties of the state and analysed for 27 physicochemical water quality parameters the ph values of the water samples in both the dry and wet seasons were within the permissible limits a number of samples exceeded the who permissible limits set for ec tds talk th cl during dry and wet seasons concentrations of so4 2 sio2 and po4 3 were within the permissible limits of who and sswqgs only 5 in dry and 6 in wet seasons crossed the no3 permissible limit furthermore 9 and 22 dry season samples violated the fluoride permissible limits of 1 5 who and 1 0 mg l sswqgs during wet season 69 samples were unsafe as per sswqgs fluoride desirable limit calcium and sodium concentrations were within the limit as set by who and sswqgs hai el shaggal torit county hiyala hiyala payam and mawanga boma chorokol payam regions had high salinity problem hai el sheggal torit county hiyalla hiyala payam ikwotos idwele ikwotos county mawanga boma chorokul payam atabpakori rowoto town water quality was unsuitable for irrigation the central western and north eastern regions of the state showed high alkalinity in wet season samples since majority of groundwater is controlled by rock water interaction during dry and wet season high alkalinity in groundwater could be attributed to interactions of caco3 mgco3 and ca hco3 2 mg hco3 2 type rocks with groundwater based on the above observations it is highly recommended that sustainable development of the groundwater is necessary in and around study area as well as in the entire south sudan it is necessary to identify wells where groundwater sources are sufficient in quantity and able to meet the demands macdonald et al 2009 wells must be protected from anthropogenic sources which may lead to contamination institutional capacity building in the area and the whole nation capable of assessing chemical and microbiological water quality is provided low cost treatment technologies including biochar geological materials etc may be considered depending on specific local conditions

12286,the groundwater that represents 30 1 of the global freshwater supplies is at risk of being contaminated by saltwater intrusion saltwater intrusion is the induced flow of seawater into freshwater aquifers saltwater intrusion can occur due to natural processes as well as over extraction of groundwater from coastal aquifers growing urban populations in the coastal regions and thus a higher demand for freshwater emphasise the importance of proper management of these aquifers and prevention of saltwater intrusion by over extraction numerical modelling is a useful tool in helping hydrologists to understand and predict how saltwater intrusion occurs in coastal aquifers there are various numerical models that can predict groundwater flow and contaminant transport such as sutra seawat feflow and modflow these numerical models are based on the governing equations of groundwater flow and contaminant transport in this paper the extension of saltwater intrusion into the coastal aquifers of the nagapattinam coastal region tamil nadu has been investigated by modelling the region using seawat engine in visual modflow graphical abstract fx1 1 introduction nagapattinam is a coastal district located on the south east coast of india in the province of tamil nadu population of nagapattinam was reported as 1 488 839 people in the 2001 census and that was recorded as 1 616 450 in 2011 census of india 2011 saltwater intrusion occurs in coastal freshwater aquifers when the different densities of both the freshwater and saltwater allow the ocean water to intrude into the freshwater aquifers the higher pressure and density of saltwater causes it to move into coastal aquifers in a wedge shape under the freshwater it is often caused by the ground water pumping from coastal wells or construction of navigation channels or oil field canals it can also occur as the result of a natural process like a storm surge from a hurricane a severe storm with a strong wind the seawater intrusion usually takes place on coastal aquifer where they are in hydraulic continuity with sea water or in fresh water aquifer adjoin saline water of connate or meteoric origin the seawater that is encroaching will encounter an area known as the zone of dispersion where the freshwater and saltwater mix and form an interface which is ghyben herzberg relationship theory that does move back and forth naturally because of fluctuations in the recharge rate of freshwater back into these coastal aquifers al farrah et al 2011 dhinagaran 2008 proper management of these aquifers is required to control the rate of saltwater intrusion and aid in the emplacement of remediation of contaminated aquifers one strategy to mitigate saltwater intrusion is to inject more freshwater into barrier wells along the coastline this creates a hydraulic barrier preventing further intrusion another management strategy is to inject freshwater into the aquifers directly artificially recharging the aquifers and restoring the hydraulic head thus halting saltwater intrusion dhinagaran 2008 saleh 2007 this could possibly be accomplished using treated wastewater instead dhinagaran 2008 before a management strategy can be set up for a given region it is important to understand how saltwater intrusion occurs in coastal aquifers and extent to which saltwater is intruding into the aquifer the studies that evaluate saltwater intrusion can be separated into two general categories field studies with laboratory analysis of the samples taken and modelling of coastal aquifers using software packages the former category involves a wide variety of on and off site investigative techniques numerical modelling is a powerful tool in helping hydrologeolists to understand occurrence of saltwater intrusion and also to predict saltwater contamination in coastal aquifers there are various numerical models that can predict groundwater flow and contaminant transport sutra 2d groundwater saturated unsaturated transport model feeflow a finite element ground water flow and transport modelling tool modflow 3 dimensional finite difference groundwater flow modelling program seawat a three dimensional variable density groundwater flow and transport model on modflow and mt3dms modular transport 3 dimensional multi species model etc sappa and coviello 2012a ekhmaj et al 2014 these models solve groundwater phenomena either the groundwater flow equation or the contaminant transport equation the strategy of improving the existing monitoring network is iterative the new monitoring boreholes have been developed using the numerical models and accurate predictions of saltwater intrusion have been made schreiber and raoui 2018 suzana et al studied the impact of high pumping rates and the reduction in recharge rate on saltwater intrusion using modflow seawat montenegro et al 2010 the impact of sea level rise and changing recharge and well pumping conditions were simulated using 3d density driven flow model lee and song 2007 the objective of this paper is to evaluate saltwater intrusion in the coastal aquifers of the nagapattinam region and to provide an accurate model of the aquifer for assessment numerical model has been developed using the modpath and seawat engines in visual modflow in the study region fig 1 2 saltwater intrusion studies the studies that evaluate saltwater intrusion can be separated into two general categories field studies with laboratory analysis of the samples taken and modelling of coastal aquifers using software packages the first category involves a wide variety of on and off site investigative techniques for instance the study of a multi strata coastal aquifer in italy involved the analysis of stratigraphic reports vertical electric soundings creation of temperature and conductibility profiles analysis of crop distribution and chemical and isotopic analysis to identify chemical indicators of salinisation schneider et al 2018 in another field study farrah et al have used hydrochemical analysis to analyse groundwater samples from libya this study discusses the chemical compounds that are most commonly found in salinised water cl na mg2 and so4 2 al farrah et al 2011 further to this cl is a good indicator of saltwater intrusion generally it does not occur naturally in freshwater aquifers without saltwater intrusion three other field studies involving the use of ionic ratios for assessment of saltwater intrusion were considered ekhmaj et al focus on saltwater intrusion in tripoli he used both the simpson s and jones s ratio to help identify saltwater intrusion along with tds total dissolved solids through spatial distribution of the ratios and examination of tds values relative to distance to the shoreline the study found evidence of injurious and high contamination of the groundwater roughly between 9 km and 12 km distance from the shoreline ekhmaj et al 2014 jin yong lee and song ho song examined the groundwater chemistry of the western coastal aquifer of buan to assess whether saltwater intrusion is occurring and whether ionic ratios would be useful in the making of this assessment the paper compares the ionic ratios and the tds for a correlation between them lee and song 2007 if the ionic ratio shows a strong correlation then it suggests the ionic ratio has increasing significance with the rise of salinization and groundwater pollution in general based on the case study examining the ionic abundance and distribution in a groundwater system located in port harcourt city in nigeria there was a evidence of saltwater intrusion as chloride concentrations of up to 710 mg l are observed in some of the 36 water samples in relation to ionic ratios it was observed that an increase in tds of water sample towards that of tds of seawater indicating a strong influence of saltwater intrusion in the region if a positive correlation was found the numerator of the ratio is seen to have increasing effect in the region as the groundwater becomes more saline montenegro et al 2010 the second category includes a number of different mathematical and numerical models which can assess the extent of saltwater intrusion however most models can be split into two categories those that simulate a sharp interface and variable density flow models the difference between the two categories is the treatment of the freshwater to saltwater transition zone the sharp interface models can only be applied where the width of the transition zone is relatively small when compared to the thickness of the aquifer the variable density flow models are used to model aquifers with a wide transition zone nwankwoala 2013 this is the most common approach as sharp interface models can only be applied when the aforementioned condition is satisfied both modflow and seawat are examples of numerical models based on this approach the investigation of saltwater intrusion using seawat engine by priyanka and mahesha was carried out with respect to rising sea levels caused by climate change priyanka and mahesha 2015 in this the author has modelled a conceptual unconfined coastal aquifer undergoing saltwater intrusion as sea level rise of 0 88 m occurs over 100 years it was observed that sea level rise will likely increase the rate of saltwater intrusion due to the increasing hydraulic head on the coastal boundary a study has been carried out using modflow to assess the feasibility of using treated wastewater in lieu of freshwater to recharge the coastal aquifers thus helping to prevent saltwater intrusion ding et al 2014 it is reported that using 35 of treated wastewater resources available in the model region saltwater intrusion could be stopped in the region further to using deterministic numerical models modflow can be coupled with stochastic approaches to give a more probabilistic approach the reason for this is to reduce model result inaccuracy caused by lack of data and the inconsistency of hydrological properties in the model region pramada et al created a model coupling seawat and a monte carlo simulation to assess the effect of heterogeneity on seawater intrusion and assess the error in model results pramada and mohan 2015 the paper concludes that even small changes in the hydraulic conductivity resulted in a significant error in the results 3 indicators of saltwater intrusion to assess and predict saltwater intrusion it is important to understand the chemical indicators of saltwater intrusion as well as other pollution sources an indicator of groundwater pollution by saltwater intrusion is salinization referring to the content of tds in a given water sample if an observation well is showing signs of increased salinization it generally indicates that there is some form of groundwater pollution occurring typical tds of freshwater drinking supplies and that of domestic purpose has a typical value is 1200 mg l and below 3000 mg l respectively priyanka and mahesha 2015 sana et al 2013 several indicators which can distinguish salt water intrusion from other sources of salinity has been outlined in the literature wastewater seepage is the seepage of any form of untreated or improperly disposed of effluent into the freshwater aquifer it is typically characterised by having a high na cl and so4 cl and a low br cl ratio these ratios will likely change depending on local wastewater treatment and water usage saleh 2007 agricultural return flow by groundwater used for agricultural purposes is the recharge of the aquifer these flows have distinctive ionic ratios when compared to other sources of salinisation so4 cl 0 05 b cl 0 005 br cl 0 02 the b cl ratio is caused by the enrichment of boron in gypsum fertilizers so4 cl is also due to the application of gypsum fertilizers the br cl content can be attributed to the hydrolysis of methyl bromide which releases inorganic bromine into shallow groundwater aquifers two ionic ratios which are particularly useful in identifying saltwater intrusion are the simpson s ratio sr and jones s ratio jr ionic ratios can also be used to indicate underlying groundwater reactions and the presence of freshwater or saltwater recharge klassen et al 2014 for these purpose other useful indicators include hco3 cl and na ca hco3 cl can be used to indicate whether the freshwater recharge or saltwater recharge is occurring in the aquifer in addition to that na ca can be used to indicate the dominance of the cat ion exchange sappa and coviello 2012 hunt et al 2012 4 study area nagapattinam is a coastal district of tamil nadu covering an area of 2175 83 km2 nagapattinam has a population of 1 616 450 people in2011 census the area is largely used for agricultural purposes net area 148 542 ha in the year 2005 2006 other land uses include forests cultivable waste fallow and non agricultural land usage the region forms a section of the composite east flowing river basin with cauvery and vennar sub basins nagapattinam has a humid 70 77 relative humidity and tropical climate with temperatures ranging from 19 3 to 40 6 c this has resulted in a medium to heavy rainfall across the region the normal annual rainfall in nagapattinam is 1230 mm yr with a maximum and minimum of 1500 mm yr and 1100 mm yr respectively in localised areas dhinagaran 2008 the region s soils largely consist of sands silts and clays there are also some minor deposits of sandstone shale and gravel these soils are deposited through both fluvial and marine processes the region s aquifers largely consist of semi confined and confined aquifers two important aquifer regimes are the lower miocene deeper aquifers and the pliocene quaternary aquifers the lower miocene deeper aquifers consist of two hydraulically connected aquifers lower orathanadu aquifer zone and the upper flowing aquifer zone the former is present throughout the cauvery basin and have depths ranging from 30 to 70 m these aquifers are confined the aquifers of the upper flowing aquifers zone coarse sand and fine grained sand with clay the aquifers are again confined flow from the orathanadu aquifer flows upward into and through this aquifer to a shallow aquifer system recharging the shallow aquifer system the pliocene quaternary aquifer consists of two shallow aquifer systems pliocene shallow aquifers and the quaternary shallow aquifers pliocene shallow aquifers consist of sands gravels sandy clays and variegated clays the brochure notes that there the lithology of these aquifers is largely heterogeneous the thickness of these aquifers range from 10 to 35 m these aquifers can be considered confined with thickness ranging between 10 and 35 m the quaternary aquifer is located within the cauvery sub basin and starts 2 3 m depth from the ground surface level the aquifer is considered semi confined confined the lithology varies often and so there is a large variation in permeability of the aquifer resulting in yield for wells varying at different locations and depths within the aquifer it has been reported that the groundwater from samples taken in the region is largely drinkable suitable for domestic use except in 17 of groundwater which have total hardness excessing that of the bis drinking water standard nitrate pollution was also present and is likely caused by the agricultural activities of the region furthermore the ground water in the phreatic zone poses a high to very high salinity hazard 5 model creation the model was created in visual modflow 2011 1 and used the seawat solver in various stages initial model set up layer creation permeability k assignation importing of observation well data for head concentration and discharge and assigning of boundary conditions once model creation was completed the model was run through the seawat engine and calibrated as necessary the model was set to run for a 30 year period from 1981 ending in 2011 5 1 initial model set up the model domain was created as the rectangular area covering the entirety of the nagapattinam district the model map in visual modflow is shown in fig 2 around 30 years of secondary data both concentration and head values of the observation wells since 1981 were used for simulation and 20 years of data for prediction upon initiating a new model in modflow a dialog window was generated and seawat was assigned as the numerical engine via selection of saturated variable density for the flow type of the simulation the units for the model parameters were set as m for length day for time m day for conductivity m3 s for discharge mm yr for recharge kg for mass and mg l for concentration the next dialog page assigned the default parameters for the model which were left unchanged as these would later be assigned within the model itself after assigning the default parameters the transport parameters such as the diffusion coefficient and longitudinal dispersity were set to 0 308 m2 day and 10 m respectively the concentration of chloride was selected as the chemical indicator of saltwater intrusion the model was created with a grid of 50 rows 50 columns and 7 layers with a maximum depth of 200 m the rows and column value were assigned to give a good mesh density and quality as seen in figure 4 2 the model depth was restricted to 200 m due to insufficient data regarding the lithology at greater depths the model origin was set as x 337 230 901 m and y 1 135 563 6 m using the global utm coordinate system wgs 84 for zone 44 n 5 2 layer creation following initial setup data from 72 boreholes near to or within the vicinity of the nagapattinam region was sorted and analysed to create the 7 different layers the data for each borehole included the upper and lower depths for the sample and lithology of the soil sample taken the borehole depths ranged from 8 to 711 m with most borehole data taken between 0 and 60 m depth the data was sorted using matlab into x z soil profiles at each borehole the code marched these profiles in the y direction to give a full 3d visualisation of the data the data was marched with respect to a y step which was taken as the next value for y at which a borehole or boreholes were located the data was then exported into an excel sheet where each worksheet presented the x z soil profile data at each y step an example x z soil profile generated by the code is presented in fig 3 once x z soil profile generated the excel sheet along with the x z soil profiles was used to create a conceptual model of the model domain to a depth of around 200 m from the ground elevation the lithology was found to consist largely of clay and sand layers or a mix thereof with some sandstone and limestone deposits at greater depths in between using all available information the layers were specified according to lithology eight text txt files were created for import into visual modflow specifying the top and bottom of each layer these files contained the x and y coordinates and the elevation m all elevation values were calculated with respect to msl these eight msl txt files were imported into visual modflow and then interpolated using the inverse distance engine to cover the whole model domain the layers created are presented in fig 4 5 3 aquifer parameters the permeability data was collected sorted and then selected to create suitable txt files for import into visual modflow three sets of data were considered in the creation of these files observed permeability from 21 boreholes within nagapattinam lithology data from the layer creation and theoretical permeability values for soil types observed in the layer creation section observed values for permeability were prioritised as these would likely reflect the permeability for similar soil deposits in the region seven txt files were created one for each layer consisting of 21 data points for interpolation over the whole layer the files contained the location of the borehole as an x and y coordinate the permeability in the x direction kx permeability in the y direction ky and the permeability in the z direction kz for import into the model these values were interpolated using the kringing engine with a gaussian distribution for 250 rows x 250 columns grid after interpolation visual modflow outputs a contour map of the permeability across the model domain 5 4 observation wells data data from 14 observation wells were imported into the model the data from these wells included locations of the well water level in the well concentration of chloride the main indicator of saltwater intrusion in this study and time of the sample taken for head observation wells 20 years of data from 1981 and 14 years of data from 1981 to 1995 had been gathered for the observed concentration in the wells the data was sorted using matlab and then imported into visual modflow using txt files the import file contained the xy coordinates screen id screen elevation observation time and observed head for the head observation wells the data required for importing the concentration wells was the same as the head observation wells except concentration of chloride in the well was imported instead of head as there was no field data for discharge discharge was estimated using the head data in the wells by arcgis 10 the discharge was calculated using the following approximation q a i s h t where q is the discharge ai is the area of influence of the well s is the storativity δh is the change in head in the well and δt is the time period over which the change in head was observed ai were approximated using the thiessen polygon module in arcgis 10 to do this a new map was created where the shape shap file for the nagapattinam region was imported the well locations were then imported into the model as an xy event layer lastly the thiessen polygon toolbox was initiated and the ai was exported to a text file for all the wells fig 5 presents the theissen polygons used to determine the ai once the ai was exported a txt file for input of the discharge wells was created this included the xy coordinates of the well well name screen elevation screen id top and bottom of screen stop time and the pumping rate of the well 5 5 boundary conditions three boundaries were outlined for the model a river boundary an inland boundary and a coastal boundary the coastal boundary was specified as a constant head boundary equal to that of msl observed from the nearest station in chennai 1 63 m and a constant concentration boundary for chloride concentration of 19 000 mg l following this an average recharge for the region was calculated using the observed head data the recharge was approximated using r d r l t where d is the maximum draw down level during the time period rl is the recharge level and t is the period of time over which the data was recorded this was calculated for the data values that showed an increase in water level in consecutive years once calculated the average recharge for each well was calculated as 840 mm yr the inland boundary was assigned as a constant head boundary and constant concentration boundary over the first 5 and 4 years of the simulation respectively as there was no field data on which to base the constant head and concentration boundary the observed head and concentration values at the observation wells were interpolated for the first 5 and 4 years of the simulation period respectively as shown in fig 6 a total of 92 points were then selected along the boundary and imported into arcgis using matlab code the xy coordinates of the points were imported to form the constant head and concentration boundary respectively finally the northern boundary of the nagapattinam region was assigned as a river boundary this river boundary represents the various distributaries of the cauvery river entering the northern region of the model domain the data required for a river boundary is end time river stage river bottom concentration of chloride permeability of bed and river width to create this boundary water gauge level with respect to msl at two river stations near the northern border of the model domain were taken from the online water resources information system of india wris daily water gauge data with respect to msl was taken from wris for two suitable river stations the data was taken for the month of august for five years 2006 2011 this the gauge data was then averaged for each year and the ground surface level at the stations location were subtracted from the average to give the river bottom elevation the river stage value for each year was taken as the water gauge level the concentration was taken from 5 different locations from arcgis s interpolated concentrations along the river boundary and then averaged to give the concentration once done the gauge river bottom and concentration data for each year was averaged to give the final value the river width was measured using google earth at both the stations and then average to give the final value the permeability of the river bed was set as the interpolated value from the permeability stage the end time was taken as the end of the simulation time 18 250 days 5 6 solver settings a brief explanation of the solver setup is presented in this section the pcg preconditioned conjugate gradient solver was used and set to run for 50 outer and inner iterations with an hclose head change criterion for convergence 0 0001 rewetting was activated and allowed to rewet dry cells every 10 iterations the gcg generalized conjugate gradient solver was solved implicitly again with 50 iterations for both outer and inner iterations with the advection solved by the upstream finite difference method the simulations were run for a total time of 50 years with the start date 01 08 1981 and end date 01 08 2031 the first 30 years from 1981 to 2011 are used for calibration and validation and the last 20 years until 2031 used for prediction of the future extent of saltwater intrusion in the region all layers were considered as confined aquifers with constant s t except the 1st layer which was considered an unconfined aquifer with constant s t the simulation was set to output data at yearly intervals 6 results and discussion 6 1 time series analysis and ionic ratios based on the preliminary assessment of the aquifer and the time series plots for the parameters cl and tds at each observation well it was observed that there was fluctuation in tds concentrations which was indicated by often a rise in tds followed by a sharp drop as given in fig 7 only 0 008 of the water samples have a tds value greater than 3000 mg l meaning that even with an increase in tds at most times the wells might still be able to be used for domestic purposes in a similar way the erratic behaviour was observed in the case of chloride samples as shown in fig 8 with 20 of samples failing and sharp rises in concentration of cl indicate the process of saltwater intrusion the calculated simpson s and jones ratios jr for all salinity sources were then compared with typical ratio vales for each contaminant these typical values were taken from works reported by ekhmaj et al 2014 and tripoli libya and the following salinity sources were considered saltwater intrusion deep brines wastewater seepage and flow from eocene rocks after applying the simpson s ratio it was found that 27 30 wells showed signs of saltwater intrusion the majority of these indications report slight contamination 72 of indications with a significant proportion showing moderate signs 21 5 with few injurious 5 and high concentrations 1 5 however on examination of simpson s ratio vs time for each well erratic profiles are observed where a previous value may show signs of slight contamination proceeded by a ratio value indicating good quality water as shown in fig 9 the red line represents the minimum value indicating the presence of saltwater intrusion this erratic behaviour seen in all the time series could be explained by the ratio hco3 cl indicating that freshwater recharge is the dominant recharge across all wells in the region restoring the head to above msl in one year over exploitation of groundwater might have led to saltwater intrusion resulting in a sharp rise in tds and cl level as well as the sr indicating contamination the jones ratio indicated the presence of all four sources of salinization in the following order of most dominant to least upconing of deep brines flow from eocene rocks saltwater intrusion and wastewater seepage this is reasonably concurrent with the observed simpson s ratio due to up coning of deep brines leading to a higher cl concentration in the aquifer in summary the preliminary results are showing signs of salinization in all the wells jr indicates the largest cause of salinization to be upconing of deep brines with the third major cause being saltwater intrusion the sr indicates the slight intrusion of saltwater to all the wells moderate to high contamination in some wells during a specified interval over the 30 year calibration period the erratic behaviour observed in tds cl simpson ratio with respect to time could be due to freshwater recharge diluting the saltwater intrusion from previous years 6 2 calibration of the model the calibration of the model was done by observing the correlation between the observed values and the calculated values from the model for both head and concentration the models had roughly 30 years of observed concentration values and 20 years of head values for modelcalibration after running the models for the first time both observed and model calculated values displayed good correlation coefficients for the head approximately 0 8 on first run however the concentration correlation failed approximately 0 5 on first run to achieve a higher correlation coefficient the model was run by altering hydraulic properties till the calibration for both head and concentration were acceptable based on the well locations and the lithology the estimated soil type was obtained then the suitable k values were selected for the areas around the well based on the hydraulic conductivity values of the soil types and the interpolated k values obtained for layer 1 and the model was rerun to obtain new calibration coefficients if the concentration coefficient was less than 0 65 the value was adjusted systematically until the calibration coefficient approached 0 65 i e if reducing the k value improved the correlation k was reduced further until a calibration value of 0 65 was obtained for the model the failing well s soil was observed as fine sand an initial estimate of kx 12 m d was used the final kx for this well was assigned as kx ky 2 5 m d and kz 0 25 m d the dispersion was then systematically adjusted until further improvement of the correlation was obtained if a 0 7 calibration was not obtained after this then the dispersion coefficient was adjusted till a value approaching 0 7 or above was obtained after these steps both models were fully calibrated using the values shown in table 1 and table 2 further to this the zone budget was considered to ensure that conservation of mass of the fluid in and out of the aquifer was satisfied 6 3 model spatial results the conductivity map for layer 1 showing the three areas around the wells where the hydraulic conductivity was changed is depicted in fig 10 from the model results it was observed that the saltwater intrusion occurred in the topmost layer of the model as isolated pockets which are moving landward as time moves on two plausible explanations for this are presented in this paper it might be due to the low value of hydraulic conductivity in the first layer which causes the intrusion to occur in the lower layers first the second explanation is due to different pumping rates in the region at different times with the following scenario if two pumping wells namely a and b that are perpendicular to the coastline are considered so that one is at some distance directly behind the other away from the shoreline both pumps are over extracting water from the coastal aquifer at the same rate if the saltwater intrusion at well a which is nearer to coastal line is sufficient in rising the water table level in the aquifer greater than msl and if well a s pumping rate is reduced saltwater intrusion would slow down in the region closest to the shoreline and might halt the intrusion altogether if the intrusion is reduced further but the well b is still pumping at the same rate as before and begins to draw away the saltwater intrusion in well a this results in a pocket of high saltwater intrusion at well b and lowers the saltwater intrusion at well a it was observed from the model results that the saltwater water intruded into the lower layers at the coastal region and then moved inwards it was also noted down that the concentration of the intrusion decreased with increase in the depth increases 7 conclusion general pollution of groundwater can be indicated by an increase of salinization in which the chloride was identified as a good indicator of saltwater intrusion as chloride will largely not increase above 100 mg l in freshwater unless groundwater intrusion is present ionic ratios were determined to be useful indicators of groundwater quality preliminary examination of the jones ratio in the observation well indicated the presence of groundwater salinisation due to upconing of deep brines saltwater intrusion and flow from eocene rocks simpson s ratio indicates saltwater intrusion occurring in many of the wells with the majority of failing samples showing slight contamination however moderate to high contamination is present in some of the samples further to this the time series for simpson s ratio behaved erratically which might be due to freshwater recharge in the region indicated by high hco3 cl ratios occurring in the majority of observation well throughout the 30 years of calibration data a model for saltwater intrusion in the nagapattinam region was successfully created and calibrated in visual modflow 2011 using 30 years of calibration data through comparison of the initial and end concentration contours for layer 1 across the whole region it was concluded that saltwater intrusion is likely to be occurring in the region in isolated pockets two reasonable explanations are proposed for this behaviour either saltwater intrusion is intruding into the lower layers first and then being extracted upwards by the wells or it could be caused by differences in pumping rates for different wells in different regions also saltwater is intruding in all 7 layers of the model this intrusion occurs firstly from layer 1 s coastal region and intrudes downwards through the layers until it reaches the deepest layer of the model level 7 future work could also involve creation and calibration of a tds model to identify areas where deep brines may be contributing to higher cl level in the model 
12286,the groundwater that represents 30 1 of the global freshwater supplies is at risk of being contaminated by saltwater intrusion saltwater intrusion is the induced flow of seawater into freshwater aquifers saltwater intrusion can occur due to natural processes as well as over extraction of groundwater from coastal aquifers growing urban populations in the coastal regions and thus a higher demand for freshwater emphasise the importance of proper management of these aquifers and prevention of saltwater intrusion by over extraction numerical modelling is a useful tool in helping hydrologists to understand and predict how saltwater intrusion occurs in coastal aquifers there are various numerical models that can predict groundwater flow and contaminant transport such as sutra seawat feflow and modflow these numerical models are based on the governing equations of groundwater flow and contaminant transport in this paper the extension of saltwater intrusion into the coastal aquifers of the nagapattinam coastal region tamil nadu has been investigated by modelling the region using seawat engine in visual modflow graphical abstract fx1 1 introduction nagapattinam is a coastal district located on the south east coast of india in the province of tamil nadu population of nagapattinam was reported as 1 488 839 people in the 2001 census and that was recorded as 1 616 450 in 2011 census of india 2011 saltwater intrusion occurs in coastal freshwater aquifers when the different densities of both the freshwater and saltwater allow the ocean water to intrude into the freshwater aquifers the higher pressure and density of saltwater causes it to move into coastal aquifers in a wedge shape under the freshwater it is often caused by the ground water pumping from coastal wells or construction of navigation channels or oil field canals it can also occur as the result of a natural process like a storm surge from a hurricane a severe storm with a strong wind the seawater intrusion usually takes place on coastal aquifer where they are in hydraulic continuity with sea water or in fresh water aquifer adjoin saline water of connate or meteoric origin the seawater that is encroaching will encounter an area known as the zone of dispersion where the freshwater and saltwater mix and form an interface which is ghyben herzberg relationship theory that does move back and forth naturally because of fluctuations in the recharge rate of freshwater back into these coastal aquifers al farrah et al 2011 dhinagaran 2008 proper management of these aquifers is required to control the rate of saltwater intrusion and aid in the emplacement of remediation of contaminated aquifers one strategy to mitigate saltwater intrusion is to inject more freshwater into barrier wells along the coastline this creates a hydraulic barrier preventing further intrusion another management strategy is to inject freshwater into the aquifers directly artificially recharging the aquifers and restoring the hydraulic head thus halting saltwater intrusion dhinagaran 2008 saleh 2007 this could possibly be accomplished using treated wastewater instead dhinagaran 2008 before a management strategy can be set up for a given region it is important to understand how saltwater intrusion occurs in coastal aquifers and extent to which saltwater is intruding into the aquifer the studies that evaluate saltwater intrusion can be separated into two general categories field studies with laboratory analysis of the samples taken and modelling of coastal aquifers using software packages the former category involves a wide variety of on and off site investigative techniques numerical modelling is a powerful tool in helping hydrologeolists to understand occurrence of saltwater intrusion and also to predict saltwater contamination in coastal aquifers there are various numerical models that can predict groundwater flow and contaminant transport sutra 2d groundwater saturated unsaturated transport model feeflow a finite element ground water flow and transport modelling tool modflow 3 dimensional finite difference groundwater flow modelling program seawat a three dimensional variable density groundwater flow and transport model on modflow and mt3dms modular transport 3 dimensional multi species model etc sappa and coviello 2012a ekhmaj et al 2014 these models solve groundwater phenomena either the groundwater flow equation or the contaminant transport equation the strategy of improving the existing monitoring network is iterative the new monitoring boreholes have been developed using the numerical models and accurate predictions of saltwater intrusion have been made schreiber and raoui 2018 suzana et al studied the impact of high pumping rates and the reduction in recharge rate on saltwater intrusion using modflow seawat montenegro et al 2010 the impact of sea level rise and changing recharge and well pumping conditions were simulated using 3d density driven flow model lee and song 2007 the objective of this paper is to evaluate saltwater intrusion in the coastal aquifers of the nagapattinam region and to provide an accurate model of the aquifer for assessment numerical model has been developed using the modpath and seawat engines in visual modflow in the study region fig 1 2 saltwater intrusion studies the studies that evaluate saltwater intrusion can be separated into two general categories field studies with laboratory analysis of the samples taken and modelling of coastal aquifers using software packages the first category involves a wide variety of on and off site investigative techniques for instance the study of a multi strata coastal aquifer in italy involved the analysis of stratigraphic reports vertical electric soundings creation of temperature and conductibility profiles analysis of crop distribution and chemical and isotopic analysis to identify chemical indicators of salinisation schneider et al 2018 in another field study farrah et al have used hydrochemical analysis to analyse groundwater samples from libya this study discusses the chemical compounds that are most commonly found in salinised water cl na mg2 and so4 2 al farrah et al 2011 further to this cl is a good indicator of saltwater intrusion generally it does not occur naturally in freshwater aquifers without saltwater intrusion three other field studies involving the use of ionic ratios for assessment of saltwater intrusion were considered ekhmaj et al focus on saltwater intrusion in tripoli he used both the simpson s and jones s ratio to help identify saltwater intrusion along with tds total dissolved solids through spatial distribution of the ratios and examination of tds values relative to distance to the shoreline the study found evidence of injurious and high contamination of the groundwater roughly between 9 km and 12 km distance from the shoreline ekhmaj et al 2014 jin yong lee and song ho song examined the groundwater chemistry of the western coastal aquifer of buan to assess whether saltwater intrusion is occurring and whether ionic ratios would be useful in the making of this assessment the paper compares the ionic ratios and the tds for a correlation between them lee and song 2007 if the ionic ratio shows a strong correlation then it suggests the ionic ratio has increasing significance with the rise of salinization and groundwater pollution in general based on the case study examining the ionic abundance and distribution in a groundwater system located in port harcourt city in nigeria there was a evidence of saltwater intrusion as chloride concentrations of up to 710 mg l are observed in some of the 36 water samples in relation to ionic ratios it was observed that an increase in tds of water sample towards that of tds of seawater indicating a strong influence of saltwater intrusion in the region if a positive correlation was found the numerator of the ratio is seen to have increasing effect in the region as the groundwater becomes more saline montenegro et al 2010 the second category includes a number of different mathematical and numerical models which can assess the extent of saltwater intrusion however most models can be split into two categories those that simulate a sharp interface and variable density flow models the difference between the two categories is the treatment of the freshwater to saltwater transition zone the sharp interface models can only be applied where the width of the transition zone is relatively small when compared to the thickness of the aquifer the variable density flow models are used to model aquifers with a wide transition zone nwankwoala 2013 this is the most common approach as sharp interface models can only be applied when the aforementioned condition is satisfied both modflow and seawat are examples of numerical models based on this approach the investigation of saltwater intrusion using seawat engine by priyanka and mahesha was carried out with respect to rising sea levels caused by climate change priyanka and mahesha 2015 in this the author has modelled a conceptual unconfined coastal aquifer undergoing saltwater intrusion as sea level rise of 0 88 m occurs over 100 years it was observed that sea level rise will likely increase the rate of saltwater intrusion due to the increasing hydraulic head on the coastal boundary a study has been carried out using modflow to assess the feasibility of using treated wastewater in lieu of freshwater to recharge the coastal aquifers thus helping to prevent saltwater intrusion ding et al 2014 it is reported that using 35 of treated wastewater resources available in the model region saltwater intrusion could be stopped in the region further to using deterministic numerical models modflow can be coupled with stochastic approaches to give a more probabilistic approach the reason for this is to reduce model result inaccuracy caused by lack of data and the inconsistency of hydrological properties in the model region pramada et al created a model coupling seawat and a monte carlo simulation to assess the effect of heterogeneity on seawater intrusion and assess the error in model results pramada and mohan 2015 the paper concludes that even small changes in the hydraulic conductivity resulted in a significant error in the results 3 indicators of saltwater intrusion to assess and predict saltwater intrusion it is important to understand the chemical indicators of saltwater intrusion as well as other pollution sources an indicator of groundwater pollution by saltwater intrusion is salinization referring to the content of tds in a given water sample if an observation well is showing signs of increased salinization it generally indicates that there is some form of groundwater pollution occurring typical tds of freshwater drinking supplies and that of domestic purpose has a typical value is 1200 mg l and below 3000 mg l respectively priyanka and mahesha 2015 sana et al 2013 several indicators which can distinguish salt water intrusion from other sources of salinity has been outlined in the literature wastewater seepage is the seepage of any form of untreated or improperly disposed of effluent into the freshwater aquifer it is typically characterised by having a high na cl and so4 cl and a low br cl ratio these ratios will likely change depending on local wastewater treatment and water usage saleh 2007 agricultural return flow by groundwater used for agricultural purposes is the recharge of the aquifer these flows have distinctive ionic ratios when compared to other sources of salinisation so4 cl 0 05 b cl 0 005 br cl 0 02 the b cl ratio is caused by the enrichment of boron in gypsum fertilizers so4 cl is also due to the application of gypsum fertilizers the br cl content can be attributed to the hydrolysis of methyl bromide which releases inorganic bromine into shallow groundwater aquifers two ionic ratios which are particularly useful in identifying saltwater intrusion are the simpson s ratio sr and jones s ratio jr ionic ratios can also be used to indicate underlying groundwater reactions and the presence of freshwater or saltwater recharge klassen et al 2014 for these purpose other useful indicators include hco3 cl and na ca hco3 cl can be used to indicate whether the freshwater recharge or saltwater recharge is occurring in the aquifer in addition to that na ca can be used to indicate the dominance of the cat ion exchange sappa and coviello 2012 hunt et al 2012 4 study area nagapattinam is a coastal district of tamil nadu covering an area of 2175 83 km2 nagapattinam has a population of 1 616 450 people in2011 census the area is largely used for agricultural purposes net area 148 542 ha in the year 2005 2006 other land uses include forests cultivable waste fallow and non agricultural land usage the region forms a section of the composite east flowing river basin with cauvery and vennar sub basins nagapattinam has a humid 70 77 relative humidity and tropical climate with temperatures ranging from 19 3 to 40 6 c this has resulted in a medium to heavy rainfall across the region the normal annual rainfall in nagapattinam is 1230 mm yr with a maximum and minimum of 1500 mm yr and 1100 mm yr respectively in localised areas dhinagaran 2008 the region s soils largely consist of sands silts and clays there are also some minor deposits of sandstone shale and gravel these soils are deposited through both fluvial and marine processes the region s aquifers largely consist of semi confined and confined aquifers two important aquifer regimes are the lower miocene deeper aquifers and the pliocene quaternary aquifers the lower miocene deeper aquifers consist of two hydraulically connected aquifers lower orathanadu aquifer zone and the upper flowing aquifer zone the former is present throughout the cauvery basin and have depths ranging from 30 to 70 m these aquifers are confined the aquifers of the upper flowing aquifers zone coarse sand and fine grained sand with clay the aquifers are again confined flow from the orathanadu aquifer flows upward into and through this aquifer to a shallow aquifer system recharging the shallow aquifer system the pliocene quaternary aquifer consists of two shallow aquifer systems pliocene shallow aquifers and the quaternary shallow aquifers pliocene shallow aquifers consist of sands gravels sandy clays and variegated clays the brochure notes that there the lithology of these aquifers is largely heterogeneous the thickness of these aquifers range from 10 to 35 m these aquifers can be considered confined with thickness ranging between 10 and 35 m the quaternary aquifer is located within the cauvery sub basin and starts 2 3 m depth from the ground surface level the aquifer is considered semi confined confined the lithology varies often and so there is a large variation in permeability of the aquifer resulting in yield for wells varying at different locations and depths within the aquifer it has been reported that the groundwater from samples taken in the region is largely drinkable suitable for domestic use except in 17 of groundwater which have total hardness excessing that of the bis drinking water standard nitrate pollution was also present and is likely caused by the agricultural activities of the region furthermore the ground water in the phreatic zone poses a high to very high salinity hazard 5 model creation the model was created in visual modflow 2011 1 and used the seawat solver in various stages initial model set up layer creation permeability k assignation importing of observation well data for head concentration and discharge and assigning of boundary conditions once model creation was completed the model was run through the seawat engine and calibrated as necessary the model was set to run for a 30 year period from 1981 ending in 2011 5 1 initial model set up the model domain was created as the rectangular area covering the entirety of the nagapattinam district the model map in visual modflow is shown in fig 2 around 30 years of secondary data both concentration and head values of the observation wells since 1981 were used for simulation and 20 years of data for prediction upon initiating a new model in modflow a dialog window was generated and seawat was assigned as the numerical engine via selection of saturated variable density for the flow type of the simulation the units for the model parameters were set as m for length day for time m day for conductivity m3 s for discharge mm yr for recharge kg for mass and mg l for concentration the next dialog page assigned the default parameters for the model which were left unchanged as these would later be assigned within the model itself after assigning the default parameters the transport parameters such as the diffusion coefficient and longitudinal dispersity were set to 0 308 m2 day and 10 m respectively the concentration of chloride was selected as the chemical indicator of saltwater intrusion the model was created with a grid of 50 rows 50 columns and 7 layers with a maximum depth of 200 m the rows and column value were assigned to give a good mesh density and quality as seen in figure 4 2 the model depth was restricted to 200 m due to insufficient data regarding the lithology at greater depths the model origin was set as x 337 230 901 m and y 1 135 563 6 m using the global utm coordinate system wgs 84 for zone 44 n 5 2 layer creation following initial setup data from 72 boreholes near to or within the vicinity of the nagapattinam region was sorted and analysed to create the 7 different layers the data for each borehole included the upper and lower depths for the sample and lithology of the soil sample taken the borehole depths ranged from 8 to 711 m with most borehole data taken between 0 and 60 m depth the data was sorted using matlab into x z soil profiles at each borehole the code marched these profiles in the y direction to give a full 3d visualisation of the data the data was marched with respect to a y step which was taken as the next value for y at which a borehole or boreholes were located the data was then exported into an excel sheet where each worksheet presented the x z soil profile data at each y step an example x z soil profile generated by the code is presented in fig 3 once x z soil profile generated the excel sheet along with the x z soil profiles was used to create a conceptual model of the model domain to a depth of around 200 m from the ground elevation the lithology was found to consist largely of clay and sand layers or a mix thereof with some sandstone and limestone deposits at greater depths in between using all available information the layers were specified according to lithology eight text txt files were created for import into visual modflow specifying the top and bottom of each layer these files contained the x and y coordinates and the elevation m all elevation values were calculated with respect to msl these eight msl txt files were imported into visual modflow and then interpolated using the inverse distance engine to cover the whole model domain the layers created are presented in fig 4 5 3 aquifer parameters the permeability data was collected sorted and then selected to create suitable txt files for import into visual modflow three sets of data were considered in the creation of these files observed permeability from 21 boreholes within nagapattinam lithology data from the layer creation and theoretical permeability values for soil types observed in the layer creation section observed values for permeability were prioritised as these would likely reflect the permeability for similar soil deposits in the region seven txt files were created one for each layer consisting of 21 data points for interpolation over the whole layer the files contained the location of the borehole as an x and y coordinate the permeability in the x direction kx permeability in the y direction ky and the permeability in the z direction kz for import into the model these values were interpolated using the kringing engine with a gaussian distribution for 250 rows x 250 columns grid after interpolation visual modflow outputs a contour map of the permeability across the model domain 5 4 observation wells data data from 14 observation wells were imported into the model the data from these wells included locations of the well water level in the well concentration of chloride the main indicator of saltwater intrusion in this study and time of the sample taken for head observation wells 20 years of data from 1981 and 14 years of data from 1981 to 1995 had been gathered for the observed concentration in the wells the data was sorted using matlab and then imported into visual modflow using txt files the import file contained the xy coordinates screen id screen elevation observation time and observed head for the head observation wells the data required for importing the concentration wells was the same as the head observation wells except concentration of chloride in the well was imported instead of head as there was no field data for discharge discharge was estimated using the head data in the wells by arcgis 10 the discharge was calculated using the following approximation q a i s h t where q is the discharge ai is the area of influence of the well s is the storativity δh is the change in head in the well and δt is the time period over which the change in head was observed ai were approximated using the thiessen polygon module in arcgis 10 to do this a new map was created where the shape shap file for the nagapattinam region was imported the well locations were then imported into the model as an xy event layer lastly the thiessen polygon toolbox was initiated and the ai was exported to a text file for all the wells fig 5 presents the theissen polygons used to determine the ai once the ai was exported a txt file for input of the discharge wells was created this included the xy coordinates of the well well name screen elevation screen id top and bottom of screen stop time and the pumping rate of the well 5 5 boundary conditions three boundaries were outlined for the model a river boundary an inland boundary and a coastal boundary the coastal boundary was specified as a constant head boundary equal to that of msl observed from the nearest station in chennai 1 63 m and a constant concentration boundary for chloride concentration of 19 000 mg l following this an average recharge for the region was calculated using the observed head data the recharge was approximated using r d r l t where d is the maximum draw down level during the time period rl is the recharge level and t is the period of time over which the data was recorded this was calculated for the data values that showed an increase in water level in consecutive years once calculated the average recharge for each well was calculated as 840 mm yr the inland boundary was assigned as a constant head boundary and constant concentration boundary over the first 5 and 4 years of the simulation respectively as there was no field data on which to base the constant head and concentration boundary the observed head and concentration values at the observation wells were interpolated for the first 5 and 4 years of the simulation period respectively as shown in fig 6 a total of 92 points were then selected along the boundary and imported into arcgis using matlab code the xy coordinates of the points were imported to form the constant head and concentration boundary respectively finally the northern boundary of the nagapattinam region was assigned as a river boundary this river boundary represents the various distributaries of the cauvery river entering the northern region of the model domain the data required for a river boundary is end time river stage river bottom concentration of chloride permeability of bed and river width to create this boundary water gauge level with respect to msl at two river stations near the northern border of the model domain were taken from the online water resources information system of india wris daily water gauge data with respect to msl was taken from wris for two suitable river stations the data was taken for the month of august for five years 2006 2011 this the gauge data was then averaged for each year and the ground surface level at the stations location were subtracted from the average to give the river bottom elevation the river stage value for each year was taken as the water gauge level the concentration was taken from 5 different locations from arcgis s interpolated concentrations along the river boundary and then averaged to give the concentration once done the gauge river bottom and concentration data for each year was averaged to give the final value the river width was measured using google earth at both the stations and then average to give the final value the permeability of the river bed was set as the interpolated value from the permeability stage the end time was taken as the end of the simulation time 18 250 days 5 6 solver settings a brief explanation of the solver setup is presented in this section the pcg preconditioned conjugate gradient solver was used and set to run for 50 outer and inner iterations with an hclose head change criterion for convergence 0 0001 rewetting was activated and allowed to rewet dry cells every 10 iterations the gcg generalized conjugate gradient solver was solved implicitly again with 50 iterations for both outer and inner iterations with the advection solved by the upstream finite difference method the simulations were run for a total time of 50 years with the start date 01 08 1981 and end date 01 08 2031 the first 30 years from 1981 to 2011 are used for calibration and validation and the last 20 years until 2031 used for prediction of the future extent of saltwater intrusion in the region all layers were considered as confined aquifers with constant s t except the 1st layer which was considered an unconfined aquifer with constant s t the simulation was set to output data at yearly intervals 6 results and discussion 6 1 time series analysis and ionic ratios based on the preliminary assessment of the aquifer and the time series plots for the parameters cl and tds at each observation well it was observed that there was fluctuation in tds concentrations which was indicated by often a rise in tds followed by a sharp drop as given in fig 7 only 0 008 of the water samples have a tds value greater than 3000 mg l meaning that even with an increase in tds at most times the wells might still be able to be used for domestic purposes in a similar way the erratic behaviour was observed in the case of chloride samples as shown in fig 8 with 20 of samples failing and sharp rises in concentration of cl indicate the process of saltwater intrusion the calculated simpson s and jones ratios jr for all salinity sources were then compared with typical ratio vales for each contaminant these typical values were taken from works reported by ekhmaj et al 2014 and tripoli libya and the following salinity sources were considered saltwater intrusion deep brines wastewater seepage and flow from eocene rocks after applying the simpson s ratio it was found that 27 30 wells showed signs of saltwater intrusion the majority of these indications report slight contamination 72 of indications with a significant proportion showing moderate signs 21 5 with few injurious 5 and high concentrations 1 5 however on examination of simpson s ratio vs time for each well erratic profiles are observed where a previous value may show signs of slight contamination proceeded by a ratio value indicating good quality water as shown in fig 9 the red line represents the minimum value indicating the presence of saltwater intrusion this erratic behaviour seen in all the time series could be explained by the ratio hco3 cl indicating that freshwater recharge is the dominant recharge across all wells in the region restoring the head to above msl in one year over exploitation of groundwater might have led to saltwater intrusion resulting in a sharp rise in tds and cl level as well as the sr indicating contamination the jones ratio indicated the presence of all four sources of salinization in the following order of most dominant to least upconing of deep brines flow from eocene rocks saltwater intrusion and wastewater seepage this is reasonably concurrent with the observed simpson s ratio due to up coning of deep brines leading to a higher cl concentration in the aquifer in summary the preliminary results are showing signs of salinization in all the wells jr indicates the largest cause of salinization to be upconing of deep brines with the third major cause being saltwater intrusion the sr indicates the slight intrusion of saltwater to all the wells moderate to high contamination in some wells during a specified interval over the 30 year calibration period the erratic behaviour observed in tds cl simpson ratio with respect to time could be due to freshwater recharge diluting the saltwater intrusion from previous years 6 2 calibration of the model the calibration of the model was done by observing the correlation between the observed values and the calculated values from the model for both head and concentration the models had roughly 30 years of observed concentration values and 20 years of head values for modelcalibration after running the models for the first time both observed and model calculated values displayed good correlation coefficients for the head approximately 0 8 on first run however the concentration correlation failed approximately 0 5 on first run to achieve a higher correlation coefficient the model was run by altering hydraulic properties till the calibration for both head and concentration were acceptable based on the well locations and the lithology the estimated soil type was obtained then the suitable k values were selected for the areas around the well based on the hydraulic conductivity values of the soil types and the interpolated k values obtained for layer 1 and the model was rerun to obtain new calibration coefficients if the concentration coefficient was less than 0 65 the value was adjusted systematically until the calibration coefficient approached 0 65 i e if reducing the k value improved the correlation k was reduced further until a calibration value of 0 65 was obtained for the model the failing well s soil was observed as fine sand an initial estimate of kx 12 m d was used the final kx for this well was assigned as kx ky 2 5 m d and kz 0 25 m d the dispersion was then systematically adjusted until further improvement of the correlation was obtained if a 0 7 calibration was not obtained after this then the dispersion coefficient was adjusted till a value approaching 0 7 or above was obtained after these steps both models were fully calibrated using the values shown in table 1 and table 2 further to this the zone budget was considered to ensure that conservation of mass of the fluid in and out of the aquifer was satisfied 6 3 model spatial results the conductivity map for layer 1 showing the three areas around the wells where the hydraulic conductivity was changed is depicted in fig 10 from the model results it was observed that the saltwater intrusion occurred in the topmost layer of the model as isolated pockets which are moving landward as time moves on two plausible explanations for this are presented in this paper it might be due to the low value of hydraulic conductivity in the first layer which causes the intrusion to occur in the lower layers first the second explanation is due to different pumping rates in the region at different times with the following scenario if two pumping wells namely a and b that are perpendicular to the coastline are considered so that one is at some distance directly behind the other away from the shoreline both pumps are over extracting water from the coastal aquifer at the same rate if the saltwater intrusion at well a which is nearer to coastal line is sufficient in rising the water table level in the aquifer greater than msl and if well a s pumping rate is reduced saltwater intrusion would slow down in the region closest to the shoreline and might halt the intrusion altogether if the intrusion is reduced further but the well b is still pumping at the same rate as before and begins to draw away the saltwater intrusion in well a this results in a pocket of high saltwater intrusion at well b and lowers the saltwater intrusion at well a it was observed from the model results that the saltwater water intruded into the lower layers at the coastal region and then moved inwards it was also noted down that the concentration of the intrusion decreased with increase in the depth increases 7 conclusion general pollution of groundwater can be indicated by an increase of salinization in which the chloride was identified as a good indicator of saltwater intrusion as chloride will largely not increase above 100 mg l in freshwater unless groundwater intrusion is present ionic ratios were determined to be useful indicators of groundwater quality preliminary examination of the jones ratio in the observation well indicated the presence of groundwater salinisation due to upconing of deep brines saltwater intrusion and flow from eocene rocks simpson s ratio indicates saltwater intrusion occurring in many of the wells with the majority of failing samples showing slight contamination however moderate to high contamination is present in some of the samples further to this the time series for simpson s ratio behaved erratically which might be due to freshwater recharge in the region indicated by high hco3 cl ratios occurring in the majority of observation well throughout the 30 years of calibration data a model for saltwater intrusion in the nagapattinam region was successfully created and calibrated in visual modflow 2011 using 30 years of calibration data through comparison of the initial and end concentration contours for layer 1 across the whole region it was concluded that saltwater intrusion is likely to be occurring in the region in isolated pockets two reasonable explanations are proposed for this behaviour either saltwater intrusion is intruding into the lower layers first and then being extracted upwards by the wells or it could be caused by differences in pumping rates for different wells in different regions also saltwater is intruding in all 7 layers of the model this intrusion occurs firstly from layer 1 s coastal region and intrudes downwards through the layers until it reaches the deepest layer of the model level 7 future work could also involve creation and calibration of a tds model to identify areas where deep brines may be contributing to higher cl level in the model 
12287,the expansion of groundwater use has not only resulted in a speedy decline in the groundwater table but also added to the problem of carbon emissions c emissions in punjab estimates of c emissions from groundwater pumping for irrigation in central punjab indicated that during the last 15 years 1998 2013 the groundwater levels had fallen by 8 89 m pump set density per 1000 ha increased by 45 groundwater use increased by 140 mm3 energy requirements increased by 4845 1 mkwh 90 all this resulted into an increase in c emissions by 984 1 kiloton 30 the relationship between carbon emissions and groundwater depth showed that for each meter fall of groundwater level in central punjab c emissions will increase by 2 67 g m³ the present level of groundwater exploitation in bhawanigarh dharmkot dhuri malerkotla i malerkotla ii nabha nakodar sangrur samana sherpur and sunam is considered as threat to the environment and should be targeted to reduce c emissions keywords groundwater levels groundwater pumping groundwater use c emissions pumpset density energy requirement 1 introduction punjab is considered as food bowl of india with more than 85 of its land under agriculture gupta 2011 during the period 1971 2017 the average productivity of rice has increased from 1 8 to 6 2 t ha and that of wheat from 2 2 to 5 0 t ha irrigated area has increased from 71 to 99 9 and the cropping intensity has increased from 104 to 204 because the climate of punjab is classified as semi arid groundwater has been the primary source of water for agriculture scott and shah 2004 the groundwater exploitation is sustained by the existence of thick alluvial aquifers formed by mighty rivers the ravi the beas and the sutlej comprising of dominant sand rich deposits dijk et al 2016 however the spectacular increase in agricultural production has come at the cost of deterioration of natural resources especially groundwater the state has witnessed a water table decline of 48 cm year brar et al 2016 on long term basis 1998 2015 the area with a water table depth of more than 10 m has increased from a mere 3 in 1973 to 53 in 2000 and further to 90 in 2012 kaur et al 2012 one of the main reasons for decline in groundwater levels in punjab is due to the rapid increase in the number of pumping units and increase in area under rice cultivation the decline rate is maximum in districts sangrur 1 08 m year barnala 1 02 m year moga 0 88 m year patiala 0 79 m year fatehgarh sahib 0 76 m year jalandhar 0 64 m year mansa 0 56 m year ludhiana 0 50 m year and kapurthala 0 37 m year which are the major rice growing areas the number of tubewells in the state has increased from 192 000 in 1970 1405 000 in 2016 anon 2017 the electricity for irrigation is freely available to farmers and they thus tend to over irrigate the fields consequently the state is now facing water crisis which has disturbed the socio economic conditions of the farmers the problem of declining groundwater levels is not isolated to punjab but in other parts of india shekhar 2006 chatterjee et al 2009 sarkar et al 2016 saha et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 and is a global problem shah et al 2000 khair et al 2010 brena naranjo et al 2014 chen et al 2016 another aspect of groundwater irrigation which has often been neglected is its contribution to carbon emissions qureshi 2012 wang et al 2012 in united states which is the world s third largest irrigator where irrigation accounts for 34 of the water use an estimate of energy use and greenhouse gas ghg emissions from pumping water for irrigation was 15 8 mt of co2e in 2005 sattenspiel and wilson 2009 in china groundwater pumping accounts upto 61 of the total co2 emissions zou et al 2013 groundwater irrigation in pakistan reported 3 8 mt c emissions karimi et al 2012 the carbon emissions also depend upon the depth of pumpsets an average 5 m deeper pump lift would increase total ghg emissions by almost 10 wang et al 2012 for the indian subcontinent limited studies have been conducted to estimate c emissions from agricultural pumping shah 2009 nelson et al 2009 kaur et al 2016 however most of these studies have estimated c emissions on a macro scale and the variation of emissions with respect to time and spatial scale is neglected therefore this study was planned to estimate the spatial and temporal variability in c emissions with an aim to understand relationship of c emissions with groundwater levels and identify most critical regions in central punjab 2 methods 2 1 study area description punjab state is broadly divided into six agro climatic zones which can be grouped into sub mountain region central plain region and southern western region since the declining trend of groundwater level is severest in central punjab the region selected for this study was central plain region the region of central punjab covers 18 000 sq km which represents about 36 per cent of the total area of state the region 70 80 km in width cuts through the state from north west to south west fig 1 the altitude ranges from 104 m in the west to 307 m in the south west and the slope varies as we move north to south further the study area of central punjab was divided into four sub zones upper bari ub bari doab bd sirhind canal sc and bakhra main bm based on the significant canal network and rainfall distribution fig 1 ub region of central punjab falls in between ravi and beas river and upper bari doab canal is the main canal passing through central part of this zone bd zone is part of bist doab tract which is inter alluvial plain between beas and sutlej sc zone is an alluvial plain with the sutlej river flowing from north east to north west of the region the zone is named after sirhind canal which is a large irrigation canal that carries water from the sutlej river and splits into many other branches to fulfil the irrigation demands of the region bm zone is occupied by indo gangetic alluvium plain and consists of three types of region viz the upland plain the choes torrential stream infested foothill plain and the floodplains of the ghaggar river fig 1 the average annual precipitation of the ub bd sc and bm zones is 1113 mm 701 mm 680 mm and 547 mm respectively which is unevenly distributed over the area 2 2 estimates of c emissions the flowchart outlines the methodology for estimation of c emission fig 2 initially the water table for different blocks was obtained using kriging technique using the methodology described by kaur et al 2011 the groundwater extraction for different blocks was estimated from the unit draft and number of pumping units anon 2013 the energy required to pump water depends on numerous factors including the source of pumping total dynamic head based on water lift pipe friction and system pressure the water flow rate and the pumping system efficiency whiffen 1991 and was calculated using eq 1 this calculated energy is validated with the energy consumption data provided by statistical abstracts of punjab from 1998 to 2013 1 energy kwh m g h 3 6 10 6 ŋ eff 1 t d losses where h is the total dynamic head as calculated above m m is the mass of groundwater lifted per annum kg g is acceleration due to gravity m s2 t d is the transmission and distribution losses ŋ eff is the efficiency of pumpsets a basic theoretical physical relationship was used to calculate energy for abstraction of water which prescribed that the energy required to lift 1 m3 of water with a density 1000 kg m³ up 1 m at 100 efficiency was 0 0027 kwh rothausen and conway 2011 further given a lack of detailed knowledge of the efficiency of the individual pumps the efficiency values were selected according to available studies of energy use for irrigation pumping in india where the pumping efficiencies are around 30 nelson et al 2009 shah 2009 the t d losses is an another grey area which affected energy requirement in irrigation year wise t d losses were taken from planning commission annual report punjab fig 3 further the c emissions depend on the source of electricity generation initially the state had a reasonably high relative share of hydro capacity however over time the relative share of thermal power has increased rapidly fig 4 the relative share of thermal power in the total owned capacity has increased from 54 in 1998 99 69 in 2010 11 cea 2011 accordingly the electrical energy share from thermal plants was computed year wise in case of diesel pumpsets overall efficiencies in diesel powered pumping systems resulted from the compounded efficiencies of the diesel engine which were 15 40 transmission was 60 100 pump as 40 80 giving an overall efficiency of 0 5 27 fraenkel 1986 in the present study overall efficiency in diesel operated pump sets was taken as 12 per cent nelson et al 2009 the amount of carbon released to lift 1000 m3 of water by one meter depended on the source of energy the rate of coal consumption in production of electricity overall for india was of the order of 0 77 0 85 kg kwh anon 1995 the co2 emissions per unit of electricity from power plants ranged between 0 82 and 1 0 kg kwh mittal 2013 co2 emissions per unit of electricity generation kg kwh for the northern region was considered as 0 93 kg kwh for the present study based on the average values from 2001 to 2010 anon 2010 2 3 relationship between c emissions and groundwater depth to develop a relationship between c emission and groundwater depth per unit quantity of groundwater extracted for irrigation the c emissions were divided by the annual groundwater draft using eq 2 a regression model was then fitted between c emissions per groundwater extracted and groundwater depth 2 c r mg m³ c e 10 6 10 3 g w 10 4 where c r is the c emission per unit of groundwater extracted g m³ c e is the mass c emission kiloton g w is the groundwater extracted ha m 3 results and discussions 3 1 estimates of c emissions based on the block wise data of number of pumpsets the overall pumpset density per 1000 ha in central punjab was 254 in 1998 and this increased to 369 in 2013 indicating 45 of increase table 1 zones sc bm bd and ub see fig 1 for these zones witnessed 76 39 38 and 20 increase in pumpset density respectively this increased population of tube wells maximized the draft of groundwater which resulted in continuous decline of water table over the years the groundwater draft of central punjab increased from 848 mm in 1998 1231 mm 45 in 2013 table 1 the percent increase in groundwater draft was highest in sc followed by bm bd and ub zones witnessing 73 58 26 and 17 respectively table 1 along with that the average water table depth of central punjab was 9 15 m in 1998 and 18 04 m in 2013 indicating the annual fall rate was 59 2 cm year table 1 amongst the four zones bm experienced the maximum decline whereas bd showed the minimum decline rate during the study period the rate of decline in ub and bd follows similar trend similarly sc and bm follows similar trend fig 5 accordingly the energy required for groundwater pumping increased from 3074 2 mkwh in 1998 7919 5 mkwh an increase of 158 in 2013 table 1 of this energy requirement during monsoon season varied from 2098 5 to 5379 7 mkwh and non monsoon energy requirement varied from 976 0 to 2540 0 mkwh during the study period it was observed that there was a linear increase in energy requirement of sc zone blocks namely malerkotla i malerkotla ii sangrur bhawanigarh sunam and sherpur of sc and samana and nabha of bm as shown in fig 1 were the most energy consuming blocks with an increase of more than 150 mkwh during the study period also the estimated energy use showed a close agreement with the data of state electricity department as published in the statistical abstracts indicating that the above methodology is apt for estimation of c emissions fig 6 for better revelation the spatial change maps of tube well density groundwater draft groundwater depth and energy requirement in central punjab from 1998 to 2013 are also shown in fig 7 based on the energy required in groundwater pumping the contribution to c emissions from different blocks was examined the overall c emissions of central punjab had increased from 365 5 kiloton to 1349 6 kiloton from 1998 to 2013 table 1 the increase in carbon emissions for zones ub bd sc and bm mentioned in table 1 is further shown as map fig 8 for better visual appreciation of the spatial variations due to the rise in c emissions bhawanigarh dharmkot dhuri malerkotla i malerkotla ii nabha nakoder sangrur samana sherpur and sunam were identified as the most critical blocks with c emissions recorded more than 30 kiloton in 2013 fig 8 3 2 relationship between groundwater level decline and carbon emissions based on the graphical method it was computed that with each meter decline in groundwater table the rate of c emissions would be different in different zones the rate was found to be 1 92 2 26 2 78 and 3 29 g m3 in ub bd bm and sc respectively fig 9 a linear relationship was observed between the groundwater depth and c emissions for whole central punjab fig 10 if the water table drops by another meter in central punjab the region will be emitting 2 67 g m3 of more carbon per unit of groundwater extracted for irrigation 4 discussion groundwater has been the primary source of water for agriculture in arid and semi arid regions of the world scott and shah 2004 india pakistan bangladesh and nepal are the biggest groundwater users in the world these countries pump around 210 km³ of groundwater every year by using 21 23 million pumpsets shah et al 2007 in punjab agricultural growth during last 35 years has resulted in declining of the water level the annual water available in the state from surface and groundwater is 3 13 million ha m mha m against the annual demand of 4 4 mha m causing a deficit of 1 27 mha m of water overexploitation of groundwater resources had been resorted to meet this deficit prihar et al 1993 johl 2002 this was evident from the fact that the population of tube wells had increased four folds since the seventies the number rose from 0 3 million in 1975 1 405 million in 2014 anon 1975 2015 the increased number of tube wells increased the draft of groundwater which resulted in continuous decline of water table and increase in carbon emissions worldover several studies show the rise of carbon emissions from groundwater pumping it is focused mainly in countries like usa china india pakistan and so on lal 2004 vlek et al 2004 sattenspiel and wilson 2009 karimi et al 2012 and wang et al 2012 shah 2009 reported that roughly 6 of india s total ghg emissions come from groundwater pumping for irrigation one of the earlier studies indicates that the c emissions from groundwater pumping would increase by 0 019 t ha for each meter fall in groundwater levels in punjab kaur et al 2016 the present study has focussed on the most affected central region of punjab and has divided the region into four zones to identify the critical sub regions and blocks it also discovers the spatial temporal relation of all the above mentioned factors such as increase in pumpset density decline in groundwater levels and upsurge in groundwater draft from 1998 to 2013 and their relation with c emissions under current agricultural practices the present study also priorities the sub zones for adopting suitable interventions that can significantly reduce the irrigation water applied to different crops karimi et al 2012 these measures should not be only limited to the identified critical regions but also to the safe regions with less c emissions at present because if they are safe today they might get this problem in future 5 conclusions groundwater pumping is one of the major sources of ghgs emissions in irrigated agriculture considering the case of punjab tube well growth during last 35 years had resulted in sharp decline of groundwater resources along with increased energy requirements the present study provides quantitative estimates of carbon emissions due to groundwater pumping in central punjab and its spatial temporal variation this study also compares all the contributing factors of c emissions from 1998 to 2013 and delineated the critical regions with high c emission rates in 2013 the relationship between groundwater depth and c emissions shows that a fall of groundwater level by one meter would increase c emission rate by 2 67 g m³ based on different factors considered for the study the sub zone sc should be targeted to reduce c emissions conclusively this study has proved that an integrated approach incorporating all possible variables of the system on gis platform is better suited for identification of the critical areas so that these areas should be more stressed and managed better for remediation of the problem

groundwater levels groundwater pumping groundwater use c emissions pumpset density energy requirement 1 introduction punjab is considered as food bowl of india with more than 85 of its land under agriculture gupta 2011 during the period 1971 2017 the average productivity of rice has increased from 1 8 to 6 2 t ha and that of wheat from 2 2 to 5 0 t ha irrigated area has increased from 71 to 99 9 and the cropping intensity has increased from 104 to 204 because the climate of punjab is classified as semi arid groundwater has been the primary source of water for agriculture scott and shah 2004 the groundwater exploitation is sustained by the existence of thick alluvial aquifers formed by mighty rivers the ravi the beas and the sutlej comprising of dominant sand rich deposits dijk et al 2016 however the spectacular increase in agricultural production has come at the cost of deterioration of natural resources especially groundwater the state has witnessed a water table decline of 48 cm year brar et al 2016 on long term basis 1998 2015 the area with a water table depth of more than 10 m has increased from a mere 3 in 1973 to 53 in 2000 and further to 90 in 2012 kaur et al 2012 one of the main reasons for decline in groundwater levels in punjab is due to the rapid increase in the number of pumping units and increase in area under rice cultivation the decline rate is maximum in districts sangrur 1 08 m year barnala 1 02 m year moga 0 88 m year patiala 0 79 m year fatehgarh sahib 0 76 m year jalandhar 0 64 m year mansa 0 56 m year ludhiana 0 50 m year and kapurthala 0 37 m year which are the major rice growing areas the number of tubewells in the state has increased from 192 000 in 1970 1405 000 in 2016 anon 2017 the electricity for irrigation is freely available to farmers and they thus tend to over irrigate the fields consequently the state is now facing water crisis which has disturbed the socio economic conditions of the farmers the problem of declining groundwater levels is not isolated to punjab but in other parts of india shekhar 2006 chatterjee et al 2009 sarkar et al 2016 saha et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 and is a global problem shah et al 2000 khair et al 2010 brena naranjo et al 2014 chen et al 2016 another aspect of groundwater irrigation which has often been neglected is its contribution to carbon emissions qureshi 2012 wang et al 2012 in united states which is the world s third largest irrigator where irrigation accounts for 34 of the water use an estimate of energy use and greenhouse gas ghg emissions from pumping water for irrigation was 15 8 mt of co2e in 2005 sattenspiel and wilson 2009 in china groundwater pumping accounts upto 61 of the total co2 emissions zou et al 2013 groundwater irrigation in pakistan reported 3 8 mt c emissions karimi et al 2012 the carbon emissions also depend upon the depth of pumpsets an average 5 m deeper pump lift would increase total ghg emissions by almost 10 wang et al 2012 for the indian subcontinent limited studies have been conducted to estimate c emissions from agricultural pumping shah 2009 nelson et al 2009 kaur et al 2016 however most of these studies have estimated c emissions on a macro scale and the variation of emissions with respect to time and spatial scale is neglected therefore this study was planned to estimate the spatial and temporal variability in c emissions with an aim to understand relationship of c emissions with groundwater levels and identify most critical regions in central punjab 2 methods 2 1 study area description punjab state is broadly divided into six agro climatic zones which can be grouped into sub mountain region central plain region and southern western region since the declining trend of groundwater level is severest in central punjab the region selected for this study was central plain region the region of central punjab covers 18 000 sq km which represents about 36 per cent of the total area of state the region 70 80 km in width cuts through the state from north west to south west fig 1 the altitude ranges from 104 m in the west to 307 m in the south west and the slope varies as we move north to south further the study area of central punjab was divided into four sub zones upper bari ub bari doab bd sirhind canal sc and bakhra main bm based on the significant canal network and rainfall distribution fig 1 ub region of central punjab falls in between ravi and beas river and upper bari doab canal is the main canal passing through central part of this zone bd zone is part of bist doab tract which is inter alluvial plain between beas and sutlej sc zone is an alluvial plain with the sutlej river flowing from north east to north west of the region the zone is named after sirhind canal which is a large irrigation canal that carries water from the sutlej river and splits into many other branches to fulfil the irrigation demands of the region bm zone is occupied by indo gangetic alluvium plain and consists of three types of region viz the upland plain the choes torrential stream infested foothill plain and the floodplains of the ghaggar river fig 1 the average annual precipitation of the ub bd sc and bm zones is 1113 mm 701 mm 680 mm and 547 mm respectively which is unevenly distributed over the area 2 2 estimates of c emissions the flowchart outlines the methodology for estimation of c emission fig 2 initially the water table for different blocks was obtained using kriging technique using the methodology described by kaur et al 2011 the groundwater extraction for different blocks was estimated from the unit draft and number of pumping units anon 2013 the energy required to pump water depends on numerous factors including the source of pumping total dynamic head based on water lift pipe friction and system pressure the water flow rate and the pumping system efficiency whiffen 1991 and was calculated using eq 1 this calculated energy is validated with the energy consumption data provided by statistical abstracts of punjab from 1998 to 2013 1 energy kwh m g h 3 6 10 6 ŋ eff 1 t d losses where h is the total dynamic head as calculated above m m is the mass of groundwater lifted per annum kg g is acceleration due to gravity m s2 t d is the transmission and distribution losses ŋ eff is the efficiency of pumpsets a basic theoretical physical relationship was used to calculate energy for abstraction of water which prescribed that the energy required to lift 1 m3 of water with a density 1000 kg m³ up 1 m at 100 efficiency was 0 0027 kwh rothausen and conway 2011 further given a lack of detailed knowledge of the efficiency of the individual pumps the efficiency values were selected according to available studies of energy use for irrigation pumping in india where the pumping efficiencies are around 30 nelson et al 2009 shah 2009 the t d losses is an another grey area which affected energy requirement in irrigation year wise t d losses were taken from planning commission annual report punjab fig 3 further the c emissions depend on the source of electricity generation initially the state had a reasonably high relative share of hydro capacity however over time the relative share of thermal power has increased rapidly fig 4 the relative share of thermal power in the total owned capacity has increased from 54 in 1998 99 69 in 2010 11 cea 2011 accordingly the electrical energy share from thermal plants was computed year wise in case of diesel pumpsets overall efficiencies in diesel powered pumping systems resulted from the compounded efficiencies of the diesel engine which were 15 40 transmission was 60 100 pump as 40 80 giving an overall efficiency of 0 5 27 fraenkel 1986 in the present study overall efficiency in diesel operated pump sets was taken as 12 per cent nelson et al 2009 the amount of carbon released to lift 1000 m3 of water by one meter depended on the source of energy the rate of coal consumption in production of electricity overall for india was of the order of 0 77 0 85 kg kwh anon 1995 the co2 emissions per unit of electricity from power plants ranged between 0 82 and 1 0 kg kwh mittal 2013 co2 emissions per unit of electricity generation kg kwh for the northern region was considered as 0 93 kg kwh for the present study based on the average values from 2001 to 2010 anon 2010 2 3 relationship between c emissions and groundwater depth to develop a relationship between c emission and groundwater depth per unit quantity of groundwater extracted for irrigation the c emissions were divided by the annual groundwater draft using eq 2 a regression model was then fitted between c emissions per groundwater extracted and groundwater depth 2 c r mg m³ c e 10 6 10 3 g w 10 4 where c r is the c emission per unit of groundwater extracted g m³ c e is the mass c emission kiloton g w is the groundwater extracted ha m 3 results and discussions 3 1 estimates of c emissions based on the block wise data of number of pumpsets the overall pumpset density per 1000 ha in central punjab was 254 in 1998 and this increased to 369 in 2013 indicating 45 of increase table 1 zones sc bm bd and ub see fig 1 for these zones witnessed 76 39 38 and 20 increase in pumpset density respectively this increased population of tube wells maximized the draft of groundwater which resulted in continuous decline of water table over the years the groundwater draft of central punjab increased from 848 mm in 1998 1231 mm 45 in 2013 table 1 the percent increase in groundwater draft was highest in sc followed by bm bd and ub zones witnessing 73 58 26 and 17 respectively table 1 along with that the average water table depth of central punjab was 9 15 m in 1998 and 18 04 m in 2013 indicating the annual fall rate was 59 2 cm year table 1 amongst the four zones bm experienced the maximum decline whereas bd showed the minimum decline rate during the study period the rate of decline in ub and bd follows similar trend similarly sc and bm follows similar trend fig 5 accordingly the energy required for groundwater pumping increased from 3074 2 mkwh in 1998 7919 5 mkwh an increase of 158 in 2013 table 1 of this energy requirement during monsoon season varied from 2098 5 to 5379 7 mkwh and non monsoon energy requirement varied from 976 0 to 2540 0 mkwh during the study period it was observed that there was a linear increase in energy requirement of sc zone blocks namely malerkotla i malerkotla ii sangrur bhawanigarh sunam and sherpur of sc and samana and nabha of bm as shown in fig 1 were the most energy consuming blocks with an increase of more than 150 mkwh during the study period also the estimated energy use showed a close agreement with the data of state electricity department as published in the statistical abstracts indicating that the above methodology is apt for estimation of c emissions fig 6 for better revelation the spatial change maps of tube well density groundwater draft groundwater depth and energy requirement in central punjab from 1998 to 2013 are also shown in fig 7 based on the energy required in groundwater pumping the contribution to c emissions from different blocks was examined the overall c emissions of central punjab had increased from 365 5 kiloton to 1349 6 kiloton from 1998 to 2013 table 1 the increase in carbon emissions for zones ub bd sc and bm mentioned in table 1 is further shown as map fig 8 for better visual appreciation of the spatial variations due to the rise in c emissions bhawanigarh dharmkot dhuri malerkotla i malerkotla ii nabha nakoder sangrur samana sherpur and sunam were identified as the most critical blocks with c emissions recorded more than 30 kiloton in 2013 fig 8 3 2 relationship between groundwater level decline and carbon emissions based on the graphical method it was computed that with each meter decline in groundwater table the rate of c emissions would be different in different zones the rate was found to be 1 92 2 26 2 78 and 3 29 g m3 in ub bd bm and sc respectively fig 9 a linear relationship was observed between the groundwater depth and c emissions for whole central punjab fig 10 if the water table drops by another meter in central punjab the region will be emitting 2 67 g m3 of more carbon per unit of groundwater extracted for irrigation 4 discussion groundwater has been the primary source of water for agriculture in arid and semi arid regions of the world scott and shah 2004 india pakistan bangladesh and nepal are the biggest groundwater users in the world these countries pump around 210 km³ of groundwater every year by using 21 23 million pumpsets shah et al 2007 in punjab agricultural growth during last 35 years has resulted in declining of the water level the annual water available in the state from surface and groundwater is 3 13 million ha m mha m against the annual demand of 4 4 mha m causing a deficit of 1 27 mha m of water overexploitation of groundwater resources had been resorted to meet this deficit prihar et al 1993 johl 2002 this was evident from the fact that the population of tube wells had increased four folds since the seventies the number rose from 0 3 million in 1975 1 405 million in 2014 anon 1975 2015 the increased number of tube wells increased the draft of groundwater which resulted in continuous decline of water table and increase in carbon emissions worldover several studies show the rise of carbon emissions from groundwater pumping it is focused mainly in countries like usa china india pakistan and so on lal 2004 vlek et al 2004 sattenspiel and wilson 2009 karimi et al 2012 and wang et al 2012 shah 2009 reported that roughly 6 of india s total ghg emissions come from groundwater pumping for irrigation one of the earlier studies indicates that the c emissions from groundwater pumping would increase by 0 019 t ha for each meter fall in groundwater levels in punjab kaur et al 2016 the present study has focussed on the most affected central region of punjab and has divided the region into four zones to identify the critical sub regions and blocks it also discovers the spatial temporal relation of all the above mentioned factors such as increase in pumpset density decline in groundwater levels and upsurge in groundwater draft from 1998 to 2013 and their relation with c emissions under current agricultural practices the present study also priorities the sub zones for adopting suitable interventions that can significantly reduce the irrigation water applied to different crops karimi et al 2012 these measures should not be only limited to the identified critical regions but also to the safe regions with less c emissions at present because if they are safe today they might get this problem in future 5 conclusions groundwater pumping is one of the major sources of ghgs emissions in irrigated agriculture considering the case of punjab tube well growth during last 35 years had resulted in sharp decline of groundwater resources along with increased energy requirements the present study provides quantitative estimates of carbon emissions due to groundwater pumping in central punjab and its spatial temporal variation this study also compares all the contributing factors of c emissions from 1998 to 2013 and delineated the critical regions with high c emission rates in 2013 the relationship between groundwater depth and c emissions shows that a fall of groundwater level by one meter would increase c emission rate by 2 67 g m³ based on different factors considered for the study the sub zone sc should be targeted to reduce c emissions conclusively this study has proved that an integrated approach incorporating all possible variables of the system on gis platform is better suited for identification of the critical areas so that these areas should be more stressed and managed better for remediation of the problem

regarding colour intensity furthermost dyestuffs have intricate aromatic structures which are extremely resilient to microorganisms and obstinate to conventional biological wastewater treatment processes manu and chaudhari 2003 pagga and brown 1986 shu et al 1994 unfortunately the textile industries wastewater treatment that combines chemical coagulation and activated sludge methods cannot fulfil the more restrictive standards for colour kao et al 2001 consequently more effectual pre treatments are required to decolourize the extremely coloured wastewater some chemical treatment technologies for dye wastewater have effectively served to remove colour by advanced oxidation processes such as uv h2o2 uv o3 or the fenton reaction malik and saha 2003 pirkarami and olya 2017 shu et al 2006 shu et al 2005 shu et al 2004 shu and chang 2005a 2005b 2005c 2005d shu and chang 2006 low cost iron nanoparticles fenps is a known reducing agent for various organic halogenated compounds lowry and johnson 2004 nam and tratnyek 2000 wang and zhang 1997 the efficacy of fenps in treating pollutants is greatly reliant on the metal surface properties since the reduction reaction of pollutants mostly takes place on the iron metal surface fenps have been recommended to increase degradation reaction rate because of its vast precise surface area however current investigations have suggested that fenps have certain limitations when employed to reduce some organic compounds the formation of iron oxide or hydroxide over the surface of fenps li et al 2006 usually decreases their reactivity in order to solve these issues a second catalytic metal such as nickel copper or palladium has been incorporated with fenps to form nano bimetallic particles cai et al 2014 kale and kane 2018 qiu and fang 2010 in this system iron acts as an electron donor in aqueous solution inducing atomic hydrogen and then molecular hydrogen at the metal surface metal hydride the hydride creation and transfer on the metal is efficiently governed by the adsorption of h ions from the water the existence of metal on iron surface serves both donor and acceptor of electrons in addition to the electron relay promotes the extent of reaction in a redox reaction for transferring the surface hydride ions to dye hence reductive dye degradation was observed due to the breaking of the dye chromophore group thus the presence of a second metal on the iron surface serves as a catalyst to improve decolourization rate by taking part in electron transfer process and also averts oxidation when the particles are air exposed bokare et al 2010 li et al 2006 nascimento et al 2016 applying a stabilizer averts accumulation of fenps and results in improved overall degradation efficiency due to the superior surface area of finer nps he et al 2007 he and zhao 2007 he and zhao 2005 it was confirmed that the stabilizers like pvp sakulchaicharoen et al 2010 toshima 2008 can be applied to control the iron nucleation and growth of particles throughout the nps synthesis and also effectually avert agglomeration of the resultant fenps he and zhao 2007 thus providing a convenient means for manipulating the size and reactivity of fenps generally particle stabilization prohibited particle accumulation and resulted in better particle reactivity blue and green colour shades produced with phthalocyanine dyes are metallic complexes phthalocyanine reactive dyes are water soluble not easily dischargeable moreover have resistance to oxidative and bacterial degradation that makes their decolourization a challenging job matthews et al 2009 rb21 a dye based on phthalocyanine chromophore is utilized extensively in various textile dyeing industries aspland 1997 green 1991 among the few

reducing agent kale et al 2014 in a three necked round bottomed flask the precursor 0 1 m feso4 7h2o was dissolved in 100 ml deionized water as the pvp addition causes a foaming problem and the reactor gets overflowed so pvp optimization was necessary 2 5 of feso4 7h2o w w of pvp was added in solution the 0 3 m nabh4 solution was added into the flask drop wise and stirred vigorously till the solution colour turned dark black followed by vacuum filtration to avoid air oxidation of particles the whole synthesis experiment was performed in a nitrogen atmosphere particles were washed thrice with deionized water and ethanol to remove the excess amount of nabh4 the reaction can be described by the following eq 1 1 2fe2 2h2o bh4 2fe0 s bo2 4h 2h2 g bimetallic nps were formed by dispersing newly formed fe pvp nps in 50 ml ethanol to this dispersion nicl2 6h2o nanoparticles w w 50 dissolved in 50 ml ethanol was added and the mixture was kept stirring for 45 min finally the bimetallic nps were vacuum filtered and washed similarly to fe pvp nps before being dried in vacuum overnight for sequential use similarly fe ninps without pvp was synthesized except that the pvp addition step in the above procedure was eliminated fang et al 2011 the experimental setup is shown in fig s 1 2 3 characterization of nanoparticles transmission electron microscope tem images were obtained with a

without further purification batch trials were executed to study colour removal of rb21 by fe ninps the various concentrations of dye stock solutions were made in deionized water and decolourization experiments were conducted in an open batch system at room temperature 28 2 c using a shaker bath machine at 70 rpm rossarilabtech mumbai samples were withdrawn from the suspended decolourized solution at constant time intervals and subsequently centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min and the remaining dye content in the supernatant was measured at a maximum wavelength of 622 4 nm using uv vis spectrophotometer uv 1800 eng 240 v shimadzu japan the decolourization efficiency was expressed by the following eq 2 2 d i 0 f i 0 100 where d represented dye decolourization i0 and f mg l stood for the initial and final concentration of rb21 dye in the solution design expert software version7 0 0 was used and face centred ccd model was utilized to design experiments for three independent factors such as dye concentration from 50 to 200 mg l nps concentration from 0 5 to 1 g l and ph from 5 to 9 the studied response was decolourization a total of 20 experiments with 6 central point experiments

concentration after centrifugation on uv vis spectrophotometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural properties of nps figs 1 and 2 show the tem images and the result of particle size analysis the fe ninps without pvp were spherical in shape having size 36 59 nm and connected in chains fig 1 a the smaller sized nps formation is mostly a result of the low molarity of ions and a surplus amount of borohydride which results in rapid reduction of metal ions consequently more nuclei are formed with controlled particle growth throughout the synthesis reaction bokare et al 2008 however fe ni pvp nps are linked in chains of spheres dispersed and enclosed in pvp with a particle size of 57 98 nm as presented in fig 1 b the fe ni pvp nps prepared 29 nm have a narrow size distribution and stable colloidal dispersion fig 2 fig 3 shows the diffraction pattern obtained for the fe ni pvp nps having the intensity of the diffraction peak at the 2θ of 44 96 xiang et al 2011 the edx pattern for nanoparticles is shown in fig s 2 indicating the presence of 56 iron and 44 nickel hence the decolourization study was done using fe ni pvp nps 3 2 experimental design ccd data analysis and optimization by rsm ccd data was scrutinized and results of anova for dye decolourization are given in table 1 the independent parameters were initial dye concentration a nps concentration b and ph c whose values were selected based on outcomes from preliminary experiments for the decolourization as a response function from table 1 dye and nps concentration were significant with very small p values p 0 05 compared to other not significant p 0 05 coefficients lack of fit test compared the residual error to the pure error calculated from replicated design points the lack of fit f value of 1 79 was not significant as p value 0 05 indicating that for the current work the model was valid eq 3 gives the resulting rsm model equation from which only the concentration of nps shows a positive influence on dye decolourization as compared to other coefficients like the concentration of dye and ph here a positive value signified an effect that benefits the optimization where as a negative value showed an opposite relationship between the independent parameters and the response 3 decolourization 92 69 6 43 a 6 35 b 0 76 c 1 16 a 2 2 77 b 2 1 45 c 2 3 62 ab 0 11 ac 1 24 bc fig s 3 shows a good fit between the predicted and experimental dye decolourization values the model coefficient of determination r2 was 0 9669 i e 96 69 of the variations for decolourization could be explained by this model hence it was applied for further investigation mourabet et al 2017 3 3 effect of independent variables the response surface 3d plots for decolourization of rb21 dye are depicted in fig 4 it shows that decolourization increased with decreasing the initial concentration of dye and increasing concentration of nps however it is more near neutral ph conditions kang et al 2012 in their nitrate reduction studies using fe ni nps had similar observations regarding reaction ph while in aqueous solution decolourization by nps is hindered under alkaline circumstances due to hydroxide coating formation on its surface alowitz and scherer 2002a eary and rai 1988a also decolourization increased with increase in the concentration of nps this observation may be because of increase in availability of the number of active positions and the reactive surface area for decolourization onto the surface of nps fang et al 2011 predicted optimized conditions by the model were dye concentration of 125 mg l nps concentration of 0 75 g l and ph of 8 27 the experimental outcome gave percentage decolourization of 93 22 under optimum parameters compared to 92 79 predicted by the model indicating the precision and fitness of the model 3 4 uv vis absorption spectra in 390 800 nm of the visible region light absorbance of decolourized dye solution measured by uv vis spectrophotometer is shown in fig 5 a maximum absorbance of the rb21 dye before decolourization was 5 859 and after decolourization 120 min was 0 39 at λmax 622 nm thus 93 34 decolourization of rb21 dye was achieved in 120 min under optimal conditions of 125 mg l dye concentration 0 75 g l nps concentration and ph 7 after decolourization it was observed that the absorbance peak in the visible region vanished whereas the in the uv range absorption peak got weakened el bouraie and el din 2016 further investigation was done using these optimized reaction conditions 3 5 influence of salt and alkali the reactive dyeing was done in the presence of salt and alkali for good exhaustion of dye onto fabric decolourization efficiency was reduced from 93 46 to 86 44 for 20 g l of soda ash addition and to 73 60 in the presence of 20 g l of soda ash and 40 g l glaubers salt addition as given in fig 6 a and b respectively thus the decolourization percentage reduced because of the oxide coating formed onto the surface resulting in a decrease in accessibility of the number of active sites of metal nps causing decrease in its decolourization efficiency alowitz and scherer 2002b eary and rai 1988b mu et al 2004 here before decolourization ph of the solution was adjusted to neutral ph with the help of acetic acid 3 6 decolourization kinetics in the current work the kinetic data achieved from the batch investigation was scrutinized by using linearized equations of first order eq 4 and second order eq 5 kinetic models mekewi et al 2016 4 ln c t c 0 kt 5 1 c t 1 c 0 kt where c0 and ct mg l are concentrations of dye initially and at time t minutes respectively analysing fig 7 a and b the decolourization reaction kinetics followed the first order model r2 0 9378 as it has a higher value for the coefficient of determination than the second order model r2 0 9224 the influence of dye concentration on decolourization kinetics was studied fig 8 the rate constant for first order kinetic k decreased as percent decolourization was found to decrease with increased dye concentration this is because of the lack of accessible active positions required for the high concentration of dye nadaf 2016 kannan and sundaram 2001 3 7 analysis the existence of dye degradation products from the clear solution obtained after centrifugation of decolourized supernatant solution was recorded by gc ms gchrms gc agilent technologies 7890a system ms accutof gcv jms t100 cv mass jeol usa the dye degraded products were extracted using the liquid liquid extraction lle technique with ethyl

2016 vanaamudan et al 2014 ftir spectra give a reasonable hint of the modifications happening in a dye molecule because of decolourization as a result of the vanishing of existing peaks or appearance

new peak was also formed at 1774 cm 1 c o stretch thus the degradation of dye by nps occurred due to the catalytic reduction on nps dizge et al 2008 su et al 2011 vanaamudan et al 2014 3 9 cod and bod of decolourized solutions cod values before and after dye decolourization were 153 and 12 mg l respectively suggesting 92 16 of cod reduction hence it can be inferred that nps not only destroyed colour but also reduced cod of the solution suggesting complete dye degradation golder et al 2005 kale and kane 2017 similarly the bod was reduced from 8 4 to 4 7 mg l sludge generation of the order

kinetics mathematical modelling phthalocyanine reactive blue 21 1 introduction residual dye content from discharges of the textile dyeing and finishing industry result in major environmental issues regarding colour intensity furthermost dyestuffs have intricate aromatic structures which are extremely resilient to microorganisms and obstinate to conventional biological wastewater treatment processes manu and chaudhari 2003 pagga and brown 1986 shu et al 1994 unfortunately the textile industries wastewater treatment that combines chemical coagulation and activated sludge methods cannot fulfil the more restrictive standards for colour kao et al 2001 consequently more effectual pre treatments are required to decolourize the extremely coloured wastewater some chemical treatment technologies for dye wastewater have effectively served to remove colour by advanced oxidation processes such as uv h2o2 uv o3 or the fenton reaction malik and saha 2003 pirkarami and olya 2017 shu et al 2006 shu et al 2005 shu et al 2004 shu and chang 2005a 2005b 2005c 2005d shu and chang 2006 low cost iron nanoparticles fenps is a known reducing agent for various organic halogenated compounds lowry and johnson 2004 nam and tratnyek 2000 wang and zhang 1997 the efficacy of fenps in treating pollutants is greatly reliant on the metal surface properties since the reduction reaction of pollutants mostly takes place on the iron metal surface fenps have been recommended to increase degradation reaction rate because of its vast precise surface area however current investigations have suggested that fenps have certain limitations when employed to reduce some organic compounds the formation of iron oxide or hydroxide over the surface of fenps li et al 2006 usually decreases their reactivity in order to solve these issues a second catalytic metal such as nickel copper or palladium has been incorporated with fenps to form nano bimetallic particles cai et al 2014 kale and kane 2018 qiu and fang 2010 in this system iron acts as an electron donor in aqueous solution inducing atomic hydrogen and then molecular hydrogen at the metal surface metal hydride the hydride creation and transfer on the metal is efficiently governed by the adsorption of h ions from the water the existence of metal on iron surface serves both donor and acceptor of electrons in addition to the electron relay promotes the extent of reaction in a redox reaction for transferring the surface hydride ions to dye hence reductive dye degradation was observed due to the breaking of the dye chromophore group thus the presence of a second metal on the iron surface serves as a catalyst to improve decolourization rate by taking part in electron transfer process and also averts oxidation when the particles are air exposed bokare et al 2010 li et al 2006 nascimento et al 2016 applying a stabilizer averts accumulation of fenps and results in improved overall degradation efficiency due to the superior surface area of finer nps he et al 2007 he and zhao 2007 he and zhao 2005 it was confirmed that the stabilizers like pvp sakulchaicharoen et al 2010 toshima 2008 can be applied to control the iron nucleation and growth of particles throughout the nps synthesis and also effectually avert agglomeration of the resultant fenps he and zhao 2007 thus providing a convenient means for manipulating the size and reactivity of fenps generally particle stabilization prohibited particle accumulation and resulted in better particle reactivity blue and green colour shades produced with phthalocyanine dyes are metallic complexes phthalocyanine reactive dyes are water soluble not easily dischargeable moreover have resistance to oxidative and bacterial degradation that makes their decolourization a challenging job matthews et al 2009 rb21 a dye based on phthalocyanine chromophore is utilized extensively in various textile dyeing industries aspland 1997 green 1991 among the few studies reported on the colour removal of this dye using peroxidase enzyme as an oxidizer marchis et al 2011 ulson de souza et al 2007 m c silva et al have achieved 57 dye decolourization using turnip peroxidase silva et al 2012 kunz et al 2002 used ozone for degradation of rb21 dye adsorption of dye was also investigated on fly ash fa demirbas and nas 2009 and clay vanaamudan et al 2014 similarly

of the rb21 dye is studied in this condition the influence of the reaction parameters like reaction time nps concentration dye concentration and ph has been optimized by mathematical modelling along with the chemical kinetic study also the influence of the presence of salt and alkali in solution with a reduction in cod and bod was investigated synthesized nps characterization was done by using

reducing agent kale et al 2014 in a three necked round bottomed flask the precursor 0 1 m feso4 7h2o was dissolved in 100 ml deionized water as the pvp addition causes a foaming problem and the reactor gets overflowed so pvp optimization was necessary 2 5 of feso4 7h2o w w of pvp was added in solution the 0 3 m nabh4 solution was added into the flask drop wise and stirred vigorously till the solution colour turned dark black followed by vacuum filtration to avoid air oxidation of particles the whole synthesis experiment was performed in a nitrogen atmosphere particles were washed thrice with deionized water and ethanol to remove the excess amount of nabh4 the reaction can be described by the following eq 1 1 2fe2 2h2o bh4 2fe0 s bo2 4h 2h2 g bimetallic nps were formed by dispersing newly formed fe pvp nps in 50 ml ethanol to this dispersion nicl2 6h2o nanoparticles w w 50 dissolved in 50 ml ethanol was added and the mixture was kept stirring for 45 min finally the bimetallic nps were vacuum filtered and washed similarly to fe pvp nps before being dried in vacuum overnight for sequential use similarly fe ninps without pvp was synthesized except that the pvp addition step in the above procedure was eliminated fang et al 2011 the experimental setup is shown in fig s 1 2 3 characterization of nanoparticles transmission electron microscope tem images were obtained with a

analysisstation jeol ltd japan 2 4 batch decolourization studies rb21 dye was selected for this experiment because of its intricate dye structure and less percentage exhaustion the dye was used without further purification batch trials were executed to study colour removal of rb21 by fe ninps the various concentrations of dye stock solutions were made in deionized water and decolourization experiments were conducted in an open batch system at room temperature 28 2 c using a shaker bath machine at 70 rpm rossarilabtech mumbai samples were withdrawn from the suspended decolourized solution at constant time intervals and subsequently centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min and the remaining dye content in the supernatant was measured at a maximum wavelength of 622 4 nm using uv vis spectrophotometer uv 1800 eng 240 v shimadzu japan the decolourization efficiency was expressed by the following eq 2 2 d i 0 f i 0 100 where d represented dye decolourization i0 and f mg l stood for the initial and final concentration of rb21 dye in the solution design expert software version7 0 0 was used and face centred ccd model was utilized to design experiments for three independent factors such as dye concentration from 50 to 200 mg l nps concentration from 0 5 to 1 g l and ph from 5 to 9 the studied response was decolourization a total of 20 experiments with 6 central point experiments

decolourization reaction kinetics was studied using optimum fe ninps concentration 0 75 g l at neutral ph at constant time intervals samples were taken from the supernatant solution to measure dye concentration after centrifugation on uv vis spectrophotometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural properties of nps figs 1 and 2 show the tem images and the result of particle size analysis the fe ninps without pvp were spherical in shape having size 36 59 nm and connected in chains fig 1 a the smaller sized nps formation is mostly a result of the low molarity of ions and a surplus amount of borohydride which results in rapid reduction of metal ions consequently more nuclei are formed with controlled particle growth throughout the synthesis reaction bokare et al 2008 however fe ni pvp nps are linked in chains of spheres dispersed and enclosed in pvp with a particle size of 57 98 nm as presented in fig 1 b the fe ni pvp nps prepared 29 nm have a narrow size distribution and stable colloidal dispersion fig 2 fig 3 shows the diffraction pattern obtained for the fe ni pvp nps having the intensity of the diffraction peak at the 2θ of 44 96 xiang et al 2011 the edx pattern for nanoparticles is shown in fig s 2 indicating the presence of 56 iron and 44 nickel hence the decolourization study was done using fe ni pvp nps 3 2 experimental design ccd data analysis and optimization by rsm ccd data was scrutinized and results of anova for dye decolourization are given in table 1 the independent parameters were initial dye concentration a nps concentration b and ph c whose values were selected based on outcomes from preliminary experiments for the decolourization as a response function from table 1 dye and nps concentration were significant with very small p values p 0 05 compared to other not significant p 0 05 coefficients lack of fit test compared the residual error to the pure error calculated from replicated design points the lack of fit f value of 1 79 was not significant as p value 0 05 indicating that for the current work the model was valid eq 3 gives the resulting rsm model equation from which only the concentration of nps shows a positive influence on dye decolourization as compared to other coefficients like the concentration of dye and ph here a positive value signified an effect that benefits the optimization where as a negative value showed an opposite relationship between the independent parameters and the response 3 decolourization 92 69 6 43 a 6 35 b 0 76 c 1 16 a 2 2 77 b 2 1 45 c 2 3 62 ab 0 11 ac 1 24 bc fig s 3 shows a good fit between the predicted and experimental dye decolourization values the model coefficient of determination r2 was 0 9669 i e 96 69 of the variations for decolourization could be explained by this model hence it was applied for further investigation mourabet et al 2017 3 3 effect of independent variables the response surface 3d plots for decolourization of rb21 dye are depicted in fig 4 it shows that decolourization increased with decreasing the initial concentration of dye and increasing concentration of nps however it is more near neutral ph conditions kang et al 2012 in their nitrate reduction studies using fe ni nps had similar observations regarding reaction ph while in aqueous solution decolourization by nps is hindered under alkaline circumstances due to hydroxide coating formation on its surface alowitz and scherer 2002a eary and rai 1988a also decolourization increased with increase in the concentration of nps this observation may be because of increase in availability of the number of active positions and the reactive surface area for decolourization onto the surface of nps fang et al 2011 predicted optimized conditions by the model were dye concentration of 125 mg l nps concentration of 0 75 g l and ph of 8 27 the experimental outcome gave percentage decolourization of 93 22 under optimum parameters compared to 92 79 predicted by the model indicating the precision and fitness of the model 3 4 uv vis absorption spectra in 390 800 nm of the visible region light absorbance of decolourized dye solution measured by uv vis spectrophotometer is shown in fig 5 a maximum absorbance of the rb21 dye before decolourization was 5 859 and after decolourization 120 min was 0 39 at λmax 622 nm thus 93 34 decolourization of rb21 dye was achieved in 120 min under optimal conditions of 125 mg l dye concentration 0 75 g l nps concentration and ph 7 after decolourization it was observed that the absorbance peak in the visible region vanished whereas the in the uv range absorption peak got weakened el bouraie and el din 2016 further investigation was done using these optimized reaction conditions 3 5 influence of salt and alkali the reactive dyeing was done in the presence of salt and alkali for good exhaustion of dye onto fabric decolourization efficiency was reduced from 93 46 to 86 44 for 20 g l of soda ash addition and to 73 60 in the presence of 20 g l of soda ash and 40 g l glaubers salt addition as given in fig 6 a and b respectively thus the decolourization percentage reduced because of the oxide coating formed onto the surface resulting in a decrease in accessibility of the number of active sites of metal nps causing decrease in its decolourization efficiency alowitz and scherer 2002b eary and rai 1988b mu et al 2004 here before decolourization ph of the solution was adjusted to neutral ph with the help of acetic acid 3 6 decolourization kinetics in the current work the kinetic data achieved from the batch investigation was scrutinized by using linearized equations of first order eq 4 and second order eq 5 kinetic models mekewi et al 2016 4 ln c t c 0 kt 5 1 c t 1 c 0 kt where c0 and ct mg l are concentrations of dye initially and at time t minutes respectively analysing fig 7 a and b the decolourization reaction kinetics followed the first order model r2 0 9378 as it has a higher value for the coefficient of determination than the second order model r2 0 9224 the influence of dye concentration on decolourization kinetics was studied fig 8 the rate constant for first order kinetic k decreased as percent decolourization was found to decrease with increased dye concentration this is because of the lack of accessible active positions required for the high concentration of dye nadaf 2016 kannan and sundaram 2001 3 7 analysis the existence of dye degradation products from the clear solution obtained after centrifugation of decolourized supernatant solution was recorded

on the removal of cr vi by batch experiments at laboratory scale scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray analysis edx analysis showed that the gjs has a porous structure and rough surface also the pores of gjs after cr vi adsorption were completely covered by cr vi oxoanions the obtained results indicated that the cr vi removal efficiency increased by increasing of adsorbent

order kinetics model according to the results gjs is able to adsorb the cr vi oxoanion from aqueous solutions and can be used as an effective and appropriate adsorbent to remove cr vi from wastewater graphical abstract fx1 keywords adsorption chromium vi jujube stems isotherm kinetics 1 introduction the toxicity of some heavy metals on environmental and human health is one of the most important problems for the chemistry and environmental health researchers eslami et al 2018 miri et al 2017 heavy metals are extremely toxic that accumulate well into the food chain and animal tissues li et al 2014 water pollution is a major worldwide concern due to the discharge of heavy metals from industrial municipal and agricultural effluents to the environment khosravi et al 2017 salam et al 2011 heavy metals such as cr ni pb cd are not biodegradable and their presence in aquatic environment has led to bio accumulation in living organisms that cause health problems in animals plants and humans dubey and gopal 2007 eslami et al 2017 wongsasuluk et al 2014 chromium is the earth s 21st most abundant element and exists in the trivalent form cr iii h3cro3 and the hexavalent form cr vi h2cr2o7 in the aquatic environment rafati et al 2010 the cr vi oxoanion is more toxic than cr iii due to high water solubility and mobility tahar et al 2018 cr vi species are very toxic and have a serious

dialysis electrodialysis mohammadi et al 2005 and adsorption by nanomaterials fu et al 2017 rafati et al 2016 have been developed for the removal of cr vi from the contaminated water and wastewater the process efficiency capital and operational costs are the main limitations for application of these methods especially in real scales ebrahimi et al 2018 mohan et al 2014 adsorption process is a simple low cost and high efficiency method especially for the removal of heavy metals from the aqueous environments inyang et al 2016 rafati et al 2018 in this technique the material are accumulated in the interface between the liquid and solid phases gupta 2009 recently low cost and effective adsorbent such as sawdust rice polish waste tea clays and fly ash have been modified by researchers for removal of heavy metals from the aqueous environments gupta et al 2015 kamranifar et al 2018 the present study granular jujube stems gjs as a natural and low cost adsorbent was used for the removal

granular jujube stems adsorbent jujube stems were collected from birjand city in the east of iran jujube stems were washed with the distilled water three times and were then dried in oven 105 c for 12 h for preparation of granular adsorbent jujube stems crushed by an electrical mill and then sieved through standard sieves of 40 60 mesh 2 3 adsorption experiment the adsorption experiments were done by adding the appropriate amount of adsorbent to a series of 100 ml various initial cr vi concentration into the erlenmeyer the erlenmeyers were sealed and then placed into the orbital shaker gfl 3005

seen the gjs before cr vi adsorption has a porous structure and rough surface the pores and surfaces of gjs were completely covered after cr vi adsorption and filled by cr vi oxoanions also edx analysis of gjs befor and after cr vi adsorption fig 1c d confirm that the cr vi element was adsorbed on the surface of gjs 3 2 effect of solution ph the solution ph is an important parameter that controlled the adsorption process cho et al 2005 solution ph has a significant impact on the uptake of the metal ions due to the effect on the surface charge and the degree of the adsorbent ionization vaghetti et al 2008 the effect of solution ph on the cr vi removal by the gjs is presented in the fig 2 as can be seen the cr vi removal decreased remarkably with increasing of ph so that with increasing of ph from 3 to 7 removal efficiency decreased from 99 8 to 88 5 in our study the most cr vi removal efficiency by gjs occurred at acidic condition ph 3 that was agreement with the study of hamadi et al 2001 entitled the adsorption kinetics for the removal of cr vi from aqueous solution by adsorbents derived from tyres and sawdust hamadi et al 2001 3 3 effect of adsorbent dose the adsorbent dose is another important parameters that must be optimized in adsorption process fig 3 represents the effect of adsorbent dose on the cr vi removal efficiency by increasing of adsorbent dose the removal efficiency increased so that by increasing of adsorbent dose from 4 to 10 g l cr vi removal efficiency increased from 90 8 to 99 8 at 2 mg l cr vi concentration and 180 min contact time it is due to this fact that the availability of adsorbent sites is limited to the ions in the batch adsorption chen et al 2015 as a result the optimal adsorbent dose for cr vi removal was 6 g l dubey and gopal studied on the cr vi removal by two low cost adsorbents which were prepared using agricultural wastes they investigated the cr vi removal by different amounts of adsorbents in range of 0 625 7 5 g l they observed that removal efficiency of the adsorbents generally increased with increasing of the amount of adsorbents both of the used adsorbents showed no further increase in adsorption capacity after a certain amount of adsorbent that was added from 0 625 to 5 g l dubey and gopal 2007 dakiky et al examined the selective adsorption of cr vi from industrial wastewater by low cost adsorbents such as wool pine needles olive cake almond shells sawdust cactus leaves and coal the adsorbent doses were used from 2 to 24 g l and their results showed that increasing the adsorbent dose increased the cr vi removal percentage dakiky et al 2002 3 4 effects of initial cr vi concentration and contact time the results of initial cr vi concentration on the removal efficiency at ph 3 and 6 g l adsorbent dose are shown in fig 4 according to the results the removal efficiency decreased by increasing the initial cr vi concentration the cr vi removal efficiency at contact time of 180 min for initial cr vi concentration of 0 5 and 2 mg l were higher than 99 while it was 92 1 for 10 mg l that indicates the removal efficiency decreased with increasing the initial cr vi concentration the contact time is one of the parameters that affects the design and operation of the adsorption process as is shown in fig 3 the removal efficiency increased by increasing of contact time so by increasing the contact time from 15 to 240 min at initial cr vi concentration of 2 mg l the cr vi removal efficiency increased from 71 7 to 99 8 the effect of contact time on the adsorption process showed that the cr vi adsorption at 180 min reached to equilibrium and then with increasing the contact time the adsorption removal efficiency had no significant change according to fig 4 by increasing initial cr vi concentration and the contact time the cr vi removal efficiency decreased in fact adsorbent has the definite active sites which saturated by pollutant in high concentration of pollutant so the removal efficiency of pollutant decreased in the high amount of adsorbents shao feng et al 2005 by increasing the contact time the contact between pollutant and adsorbent surface increased and so the removal efficiency increased argun and dursun 2008 also the initial adsorption rate increased rapidly and the equilibrium was attained at 60 min with cr vi removal efficiency of

respectively determination coefficient r2 of the fitted experimental data with langmuir freundlich and temkin linear adsorption isotherm models were 0 6460 0 9343 and 0 6954 respectively therefore the adsorption process of cr vi by gjs were well fitted to the freundlich isotherm model fig 6 kf and n in freundlich model for the adsorption of cr vi by gjs were 4 76 mg g and 0 65 respectively that indicate the adsorption of cr vi was favorable at optimum condition 4 conclusion the main purpose of this study was the application of granular jujube stems gjs as a natural and porous adsorbent for improving the removal efficiency of cr vi oxoanion from the aqueous solution sem images before and after cr vi adsorption showed that the gjs had a porous structure and rough surface also the pores
