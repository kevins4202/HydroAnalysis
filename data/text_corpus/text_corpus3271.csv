16355,biofilms are ubiquitous in natural and engineered environments and of great importance in drinking water distribution and biological wastewater treatment systems simultaneously acquiring the chemical and structural information of the hydrated biofilm matrix is essential for the cognition and regulation of biofilms in the environmental field however the complexity of samples and the limited approaches prevent a holistic understanding of the biofilm matrix in this work an approach based on the confocal raman mapping technique integrated with non negative matrix factorization nmf analysis was developed to probe the hydrated biofilm matrix in situ the flexibility of the nmf analysis was utilized to subtract the undesired water background signal and resolve the meaningful biological components from raman spectra of the hydrated biofilms diverse chemical components such as proteins bacterial cells glycolipids and polyhydroxyalkanoates pha were unraveled within the distinct pseudomonas spp biofilm matrices and the corresponding 3 dimensional spatial organization was visualized and quantified of these components glycolipids and pha were unique to the p aeruginosa and p putida biofilm matrix respectively furthermore their high abundances in the lower region of the biofilm matrix were found to be related to the specific physiological functions and surrounding microenvironments overall the results demonstrate that our nmf raman mapping method could serve as a powerful tool complementary to the conventional approaches for identifying and visualizing the chemical components in the biofilm matrix this work may facilitate the online characterization of the biofilm matrix widely present in the environment and advance the fundamental understanding of biofilm graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofilm raman mapping non negative matrix factorization pseudomonas putida pseudomonas aeruginosa 1 introduction biofilms are the microbial aggregates embedded in the self produced extracellular polymeric substances eps flemming 2020 they are ubiquitous in natural and engineered environments and are of great importance in a diverse range of disciplines and applications in the fields of environment biotechnology and medicine flemming 2020 rittmann 2018 on the one hand biofilms are widely used in wastewater treatment for nutrient and contaminant removal microbial fuel cells for electricity generation and biocatalysis for chemical production rittmann 2018 on the other hand biofilms are the root causes of a variety of intractable chronic infections and industrial biofouling flemming 2020 therefore we need to advance knowledge of the biofilm matrix to control and make use of them nevertheless the heterogeneity of the chemical composition and spatial structure highly increases the difficulty in investigating the biofilm matrix specifically the chemical constituents vary significantly depending on the microbial species within the biofilm matrix except for the widely known macromolecules such as polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and lipids there are still many organic or inorganic substances within the biofilm matrix that could not be conveniently characterized namely the dark matter seviour et al 2019 moreover the spatial distribution of the various constituents is heterogeneous and intimately related to the microenvironment or physiological functions the structural heterogeneity provides a protective barrier and facilitates the adsorption and storage of the nutrients for biofilm growth flemming and wingender 2010 therefore it is of particular interest to get more information about both the chemical composition and corresponding spatial organization of the biofilm matrix various microscopic methods have been applied to characterize the chemical compositions as well as the three dimensional 3d structure of biofilms simultaneously among them confocal raman microscopy crm has stood out as a potential bioimaging tool to meet these requirements with nondestructive label free and in situ characteristics krafft et al 2017 liu et al 2020 since raman spectroscopy is based on the inelastic light scattering of molecules a wide variety of biomolecules within the biofilm matrix could be detected kusic et al 2015 for example the polyphosphate polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and glycogen involved in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal process were probed by their characteristic raman signals majed and gu 2010 the nucleic acids carotenoids proteins and lipids in the rhodococcus sp sd 74 biofilms were observed by using crm zheng et al 2013 unfortunately most of the existing crm studies on biofilms have focused on the univariate analysis with several specific raman bands which could result in erroneous interpretations of the underlying biochemistry due to the great spectral superposition of the broad molecular constituent classes huang et al 2012 masyuko et al 2014 zheng et al 2013 besides the high information content available in hyperspectral data is not fully exploited to visualize the spatial distributions of all major chemical components yasuda et al 2019 to overcome the shortcomings of the univariate analysis we have very recently developed a methodology integrating crm with non negative matrix factorization nmf analysis to decrypt the development process of the escherichia coli biofilms and successfully elucidated the spatiotemporal changes of the chemical components in the biofilm matrix liu et al 2020 nmf analysis which assumes that the hyperspectral data could be approximated by a linear combination of several spectral components could readily provide physically interpretable spectral components without any a priori information szymanska chargot et al 2016 thanks to the relatively thin and uniform structure the air dried biofilms were successfully probed in the previous work however in most cases the biofilm matrix can be very thick varying in the degree of porosity and having a mushroom like structure or consisting of water channels flemming and wingender 2010 in this case the air drying process probably brings polymer sites closer together and leads to the distortion of the spatial structure zhang et al 2018 therefore the ability to probe the hydrated biofilm matrix would offer a more realistic spatial structure and contribute to the online characterization in the future which is particularly relevant to water treatment and medical studies the major drawback that needs to be overcome to fully exploit raman spectroscopy for the characterization of the hydrated biofilm is the undesired background signals such as the water up to 95 of the biofilm matrix and substrate signal e g coverslip quartz etc sutherland 2001 these interfering signals might reduce the ability to perform stable and robust statistical modeling and thus are desirable to be removed from the original spectral data beier and berger 2009 marro et al 2018 in this work we generalized the method integrating crm with nmf analysis to the hydrated biofilm matrix the chemical and structural information of the distinct hydrated biofilm matrices was captured by crm with the help of a water immersion objective the flexibility of the nmf algorithm was utilized to remove the undesired background signal from water and extract meaningful molecular components from the raman spectra since pseudomonas spp are widespread in natural and engineered water systems and exhibit many unique characteristics e g pathogenicity antibiotic resistance and the capabilities to form biofilms biodegrade pollutants and adapt to a wide range of habitats they have received much attention from researchers in the environmental field mena and gerba 2009 douterelo et al 2013 falkinham et al 2015 lv et al 2017 kurzbaum et al 2017 qi et al 2019 jeanvoine et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 herein two commonly used model species for biofilm formation in the environmental field i e pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida were selected to validate the approach integrating crm and nmf analysis xue et al 2014 lee et al 2017 with nmf analysis the various chemical constituents and their corresponding spatial distribution could be fully resolved in this way the hydrated biofilm matrix could be visualized qualified and quantified which can be useful to understand the biofilm matrix in the environment at the molecular level 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation p aeruginosa pao1 dsm 22644 and p putida dsm 291 were utilized to construct biofilms the stored bacteria cells were cultivated on nutrient agar plates and incubated overnight a single colony was then transferred from the plate into the sterilized luria bertani lb broth and grown overnight in a shaker incubator at 120 rpm the cells were diluted to an optical density od of 0 4 at 600 nm as an inoculum for biofilm growth the inoculum was pipetted into a petri dish with a caf2 substrate and the cells were allowed to settle for 1 h subsequently the p aeruginosa and p putida biofilms were cultivated in 0 02 strength lb broth to create nutrient limited growth conditions xue et al 2014 the biofilms were grown statically and aerobically with the growth medium changed gently every day the incubation temperatures of p aeruginosa and p putida cells at each step were 37 c and 30 c respectively after 4 weeks the biofilms reached maturity with the 3d structure the extra medium was removed from the petri dish and the biofilms were washed twice with sterile water to remove the unattached cells considering that p aeruginosa bacterial cells could possibly produce polysaccharides and polysaccharides usually exhibit raman features in the range from 400 to 600 cm 1 caf2 substrates were used herein to grow biofilms wagner et al 2009 in comparison fused silica exhibits strong and broad bands in this spectral range when immersed in water which could be hardly removed by data processing methods kerr et al 2015 ramoji et al 2016 2 2 3d raman mapping z stack raman images of p aeruginosa and p putida biofilms grown on the caf2 substrates were captured by crm witec gmbh ulm germany the crm was equipped with a 600 lines mm 1 grating and a thermoelectrically cooled ccd detector and the spectral resolution was ca 5 cm 1 since the p aeruginosa and p putida biofilm samples did not exhibit fluorescence activity a wavelength of 514 nm was used for excitation otherwise photobleaching or a longer wavelength laser was recommended to be taken advantage of to eliminate the fluorescence signal macdonald and wyeth 2006 davin et al 2010 meyer et al 2011 in the latter case more integration time stronger laser power and larger confocal aperture could be used to improve the spectral quality trebolazabala et al 2013 kerr et al 2015 in this work the raman spectra were collected through a 60 nikon water immersion objective na 1 0 with the laser power of 8 mw silge et al 2016 the biofilm samples were scanned over an area of 20 μm 20 μm in the center of the microcolonies with x y direction steps of 0 5 μm and an integration time of 2 s per spectrum to avoid the escape of bacterial cells from the biofilm matrix and ensure the integrity of the biofilm matrices a mapping time of less than 16 h should be used considering that the thicknesses of the p aeruginosa and p putida biofilm matrices were around 96 μm and 22 μm respectively the z direction step was 8 μm for p aeruginosa and 2 μm for p putida figs s1 and s2 show the bright field images of the biofilm matrices and the results of hierarchical clustering analysis hca of the average spectra from different layers respectively the spatial distribution and the chemical information of the adjacent layers separated by a distance of 8 μm were quite similar indicating that the adequate chemical and spatial information could be provided with a z direction step of 8 μm for the calibration procedure the raman spectra of a wavenumber standard e g 4 acetamidophenol were captured daily before the mapping measurement dörfer et al 2011 2 3 data analysis and chemometric methods data analysis was performed with an in house written script based on gnu r and the nnlm package was utilized for the nmf analysis lin and boutros 2020 team 2013 the process is summarized in fig 1 firstly the hyperspectral images of the biofilm samples captured at various depths were unfolded and assembled into a matrix a υ m eq 1 herein υ represents the number of data points per spectrum along with the wavenumber axis and m is the number of spectra in the dataset which is equal to x y z a i i 1 2 z is the spectral submatrix of the it h layer consisting of υ rows and x y columns for instance the z stack images of the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix consisted of 13 layers and each layer contained x y 40 40 points then there were m x y z 40 40 13 20 800 spectra in the hyperspectral dataset of the p aeruginosa biofilm 1 a a 1 a 2 a z the obtained hyperspectral matrix was then preprocessed including removal of cosmic spikes by comparing the raman spectra that were measured successively baseline correction with the snip algorithm and wavenumber calibration based on the spectrum of the standard material 4 acetaminophenol bocklitz et al 2011 dörfer et al 2011 liu et al 2020 since almost all the chemical components of interest exhibit unique features in the fingerprint region and the water signal is also relatively weak in this region the preprocessed spectral matrix was truncated to the spectral region from 500 to 1850 cm 1 morais et al 2020 the nmf analysis was then performed on the preprocessed hyperspectral dataset to remove the background signal from water and it could be expressed as 2 a wh w 0 h 1 e where a is the preprocessed hyperspectral matrix w 0 is the known water signal profiles which only exhibited the oh related peaks i e oh bending vibration mode at 1643 cm 1 owing to the large amount of water in the hydrated biofilms the water spectral profiles could be originated from the matrix a or directly measured w is the raman spectral profiles of the other chemical components in the biofilm matrix and its column number is the number of the other chemical components k duraipandian et al 2018 tsubaki et al 2019 lin and boutros 2020 an approximate estimation of k could be obtained using the singular value decomposition svd analysis h and h 1 are the corresponding concentration profiles of w and w 0 e is the error matrix reflecting the residual of the dataset that was not related to any chemical contributions given a w 0 and the number of other components k w h and h 1 could be estimated by minimizing the term 1 2 e f 2 with the constraint of w 0 and h 0 the minimization problem can be quickly solved using the alternating non negative least squares anls approach incorporated with the sequential coordinate wise descent scd algorithm liu et al 2020 lin and boutros 2020 indeed one can treat the known spectral profiles w 0 as a form of hard regularization in this step and the corresponding concentration profile h 1 could be calculated by nmf analysis in order to remove the water signals and obtain the chemical composition of biofilm matrix the spectral contribution of w 0 h 1 was directly subtracted from the preprocessed hyperspectral matrix a eq 3 the reconstructed hyperspectral dataset was noted as a which would provide greater visibility of some subtle spectral changes inherent to the macromolecules in the biofilm matrix and may also contribute to building a statistical model with chemically meaningful output kuligowski et al 2011 marro et al 2018 3 a a w 0 h 1 the reconstructed matrix a was vector normalized and smoothed by the 9 point savitzky golay algorithm the spectral features remained almost unchanged after smoothing fig s3 then the spectra from the same z layer were averaged and the average spectra of different layers were compared to provide a preliminary understanding of the vertical changes of the chemical composition in the biofilm matrix the average spectra of different layers of the p aeruginosa biofilm were additionally subjected to the hca analysis and the results indicates that the chemical information of the adjacent layers was quite similar fig s2 the nmf analysis was performed again on the reconstructed hyperspectral matrix a to resolve the pure spectral profiles of chemical components involved in the biofilm matrix w and their corresponding concentration matrix h eq 4 4 a w e the optimal number of the chemical component k in matrix a was estimated by svd analysis the evaluation parameters lack of fit lof and variance explained r 2 and the residual spectra liu et al 2020 finally to identify the chemical meanings of the extracted spectra they were compared with the reference spectra of the common biological molecules the spectral similarity was evaluated by the spectral angle metric which is based on the cosine of the angle between the calculated spectra and the reference spectra schollee et al 2017 the similarity score r ranges from 0 to 1 and 1 represents a perfect match eq 5 5 r s a s b s a s b i 1 υ s a i s b i i 1 υ s a i 2 i 1 υ s b i 2 herein sa and sb are the raman signals of compound a pure spectra resolved by nmf analysis and b reference spectra respectively the term υ represents the number of data points per spectrum along with the wavenumber axis and s a i and s b i are the raman intensities of compounds a and b at the i th wavenumber respectively the calculated concentration profile h was used to reconstruct the 3d spatial distribution of the chemical components via amira a threshold was selected automatically by the isodata algorithm for image segmentation heydorn et al 2000 the pixels with the abundance above the threshold were deemed to be related to biomass and thus were counted to obtain the area coverage 3 results and discussion 3 1 raman spectra of the reference samples polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and lipids are the major components of the biofilm matrix thus various nucleic acids dna and rna from different species of bacteria polysaccharides starch na alginate dextran and cellulose proteins ovalbumin bovine serum albumin and lysozyme and lipids phosphatidylethanolamine mycolic acid trimyristin and triolein were measured as reference substances to interpret the raman spectra of the biofilm matrix fig s4 the band assignment of the reference substances is summarized in table s1 raman spectra of the nucleic acids from various microorganisms were quite similar and exhibited features at 1665 t 1585 1570 a g 1484 a g 1416 ch2 deformation 1371 a g t 1340 1330 a 1100 1090 po2 785 780 c u 730 720 a and 675 cm 1 t g benevides et al 2005 kuhar et al 2018 the phosphate mode at 1100 1090 cm 1 is typical for the nucleic acids and has been utilized to quantify the nucleic acids in the cell nucleus kuhar et al 2018 for the tested polysaccharides their raman spectra varied significantly owing to the different structures the fingerprint bands of polysaccharides were mainly located in 3 regions ch ch2 deformational motions at 1500 1200 cm 1 cc stretch coc glucosidic link and ring breathing modes at 1200 950 cm 1 and side group e g coh cch och deformations at 950 700 cm 1 moreover coo stretching modes 1650 1540 1450 1360 cm 1 were characteristic for polyanionic polysaccharides such as na alginate wagner et al 2009 the 1200 700 cm 1 region of polysaccharides exhibited signals of moderate to high intensity and was particularly suited to discriminate polysaccharides from other important classes of biomolecules such as proteins or lipids wagner et al 2009 wiercigroch et al 2017 raman spectra of proteins showed characteristic bands in the regions of 1700 1580 cm 1 amide i 1620 1605 cm 1 tyr trp phe and 1300 1200 cm 1 amide iii rygula et al 2013 the sharp band at 1004 cm 1 was assigned to phe for the tested lipids the most characteristic features were located at 1500 1400 cm 1 1300 1250 cm 1 and 1200 1050 cm 1 which were related to the presence of the hydrocarbon chain c o ester stretching vibrations 1750 1700 cm 1 and c c stretching vibrations 1660 1650 cm 1 were likely present in the spectra of some unsaturated lipids additionally the po2 symmetric stretching vibration of phospholipid was located at 1085 cm 1 czamara et al 2015 3 2 water background subtraction by nmf analysis with 4 week incubation the biofilms of p aeruginosa and p putida became heterogeneous and had a 3d structure indicating that the biofilms reached the mature stage the 3d raman images of the two types of hydrated biofilms were captured by crm since water is the dominant component of the biofilm matrix up to 95 the subtraction of the water signal could lead to a larger visibility of the subtle spectral changes inherent to the biofilm spectra making it easier to resolve the other chemical meaningful components and quantify their spatial distribution beier and berger 2009 marro et al 2018 sutherland 2001 the hyperspectral dataset of the biofilm matrix a was fed into the nmf analysis with the water signals as w 0 given a and w 0 h w and h 1 could be calculated using the anls approach incorporated with the scd algorithm lin and boutros 2020 subsequently direct subtraction of the water signals nmf loadings w 0 multiplied by the corresponding concentration matrix nmf scores h 1 was performed to remove the water signals from the hyperspectral dataset the averaged spectra of the optical slices before and after the subtraction of the water signals are presented in fig 2 suggesting that the spectral contribution of water was successfully removed the ability of nmf analysis to remove the undesired background signals was also reported by several previous studies kunc et al 2013 marro et al 2018 tan et al 2019 lobanova and lobanov 2019 for instance lobanova and lobanov 2019 reported that the nmf method was particularly useful to eliminate the contribution of wax residues to the spectral basis for paraffin embedded samples 3 3 raman spectra of the biofilms formed by p aeruginosa and p putida after the subtraction of the water signal the spectra of each optical slice were vector normalized and averaged to give a preliminary impression of the biofilm matrix as shown in fig 3 the layer close to the substrate surface was deemed as 0 μm bottom layer according to the previous studies and table s1 the raman features of the biofilm matrix are related to the macromolecules e g proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids and lipids kusic et al 2015 wagner et al 2009 in the raman spectra of the p aeruginosa biofilm fig 3a the protein related peaks are at 1664 amide i 1249 amide iii and 1006 cm 1 phe nucleic acids associated bands are at 1582 a g 1339 a 1094 po2 and 785 cm 1 c u and the signal at 1126 cm 1 cc stretching coc glycosidic link symmetric ring breathing arises from the polysaccharides due to the existence of ch2 and ch3 groups in all macromolecules the raman spectra also contain the ch2 deformation vibrations at 1455 cm 1 kusic et al 2015 the average spectra of different sampling depth in the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix were similar and exhibited only minor variations indicating that the mature biofilm formed by p aeruginosa was relatively homogenous compared to the raman spectra of the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix the spectra of the p putida biofilm matrix consisted of several additional peaks at 1737 1062 and 837 cm 1 which might be associated with the emergence of pha fig 3b moreover the spectra of the p putida biofilm matrix varied significantly with depth suggesting the heterogeneous distribution of the chemical constituents for example the nucleic acid related features at 785 cm 1 exhibited strong signals in the upper region while the pha associated peaks were intense in the lower region close to the caf2 substrate 3 4 nmf analysis on the hyperspectral images of the p aeruginosa biofilm considering the great spectral superposition of various macromolecules it is difficult to unambiguously assign the specific raman bands of the biofilms to the known biomolecules and quantify the content of each chemical species hence the nmf analysis was conducted to extract the chemical information within the biofilm matrix based on the clean hyperspectral dataset without water contribution the svd analysis and the nmf analysis with 1 2 3 4 and 5 components were performed and the corresponding singular value and the evaluation parameters lof and r 2 are presented in fig s5 according to the singular value there could be 2 3 or 4 chemical components in the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix the lof and r 2 varied significantly from 2 to 3 components and less from 3 to 4 components moreover the pure spectral profiles and the residual spectral matrix calculated by the nmf analysis with 2 3 and 4 component models are displayed in fig s6 to give a direct impression of the fitting performance with different component numbers the typical raman spectra of the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix and the corresponding residual spectra of nmf analysis with 1 2 3 4 and 5 component models are presented in fig s7 based on the residual spectra shown in figs s6 and s7 the addition of the 3rd component showed a notable improvement of the fitting performance especially in the spectral region of 1800 1200 cm 1 while the addition of the 4th component did not the almost identical residual spectra of nmf analysis with 3 4 and 5 compoent models indicate the possible presence of overfitting with the addition of the 4th and 5th components in addition there seems to be some self contradicts in the pure spectra extracted by 4 component nmf analysis for instance the spectrum of component 2 extracted by the 4 component nmf analysis exhibited the strong peaks at around 1642 and 1582 cm 1 indicating that the component should be related to proteins and nucleic acids however the other peaks related to proteins and nucleic acids e g 1006 phe 1094 po2 and 785 cm 1 c u were absent in this spectrum therefore from the perspectives of fitting performance and the biological meanings of the extracted spectra there should be 3 main components in the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix the results of the 3 component nmf analysis of the p aeruginosa hyperspectral images are summarized in fig 4 including the pure spectral profiles spatial organization and the distribution of area coverage with distinct sampling depths to explicitly assign the nmf resolved spectra we compared the pure spectrum of each component with the reference spectra of proteins polysaccharides dna and glycolipids fig s8 component 1 represented a typical raman spectrum of bacteria the characteristic bands related to the proteins are located at 1664 amide i 1249 amide iii and 1006 cm 1 phe and those related to the nucleic acids are located at 1582 a g 1094 po2 and 785 cm 1 c u component 2 should be associated with proteins according to the peaks at 1664 1249 and 1006 cm 1 the nucleic acids relevant features at 1582 1094 and 785 cm 1 were not apparent compared to the reference spectra of lipids polysaccharides and glycolipids component 3 was tentatively assigned to glycolipids the signals at 1163 cc coc glycosidic link asymmetric ring breathing 1126 cc coc glycosidic link symmetric ring breathing 894 cc coc 1 4 glycosidic link and 861 cm 1 cc cocc 1 4 glycosidic link were related to the polysaccharides the peak at 1308 ch2 ch3 seemed to be the overlap of the broad vibrational band of polysaccharides and a sharp band of lipids and quite similar to the peak of glycolipids leu et al 2020 the features at 1737 c o 1660 c o c c and 1076 cm 1 coh ch were possibly assigned to polysaccharides or lipids wagner et al 2009 in the context of pseudomonas derived biofilms the features at 1163 and 1126 cm 1 were consistent in the presence of rhamnolipids a major class of glycolipids produced by pseudomonas spp and regulated by quorum sensing khademolhosseini et al 2019 masyuko et al 2014 singh and tiwary 2016 additionally the similarity scores between the resolved pure spectra of the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix and the reference spectra are presented in table s2 component 1 matched well with the nucleic acid and proteins and component 2 matched well with proteins as for component 3 it showed a good match with the glycolipid and lipids therefore there were three main components i e bacterial cells proteins and glycolipids in the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix and the glycolipid signal might be assigned to rhamnolipids masyuko et al 2014 investigated the p aeruginosa biofilm by crm and found out that there were a large number of proteins and glycolipids in the mature biofilm and the glycolipids signal was further confirmed to possibly originate from the rhamnolipids by the matrix assisted laser desorption mass spectroscopy in addition lanni et al 2014 have also detected a huge variety of rhamnolipids in the p aeruginosa biofilm as a secondary metabolic product rhamnolipids were reported to abound in the mature p aeruginosa biofilm matrix especially in the interior region facilitating the immigration of bacterial cells the formation of mushroom like structure the maintenance of the water channel as well as the biofilm dispersion heacock kang et al 2017 pamp and tolker nielsen 2007 the 3d spatial distribution of the three components derived from the nmf analysis is shown in fig 4b it is worth noting that in view of the changes of the focal plane the acquired raman spectra were vector normalized thus fig 4b reflects the relative concentration distribution of the three components the isodata method was used to automatically segment the abundance distribution image into the biomass and voids and the number of pixels associated with biomass was counted to obtain the area coverage which is shown in fig 4c component 1 i e the bacterial cells showed relatively higher area coverages within the top and bottom biofilm layers components 2 proteins and 3 glycolipids were mainly distributed in the top and bottom layers of the biofilm matrix respectively this observation may suggest that proteins were closely related to the oxygen and nutrition availability and might play an important role in the cell cell interaction lee and yoon 2017 wei and ma 2013 xu et al 1998 recent studies have shown that a large number of proteins were present in the p aeruginosa biofilm providing the structural scaffolds and active functional networks reichhardt and parsek 2019 the existence of glycolipids in the bottom region of the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix was in good agreement with the localization of the rhamnolipid synthesis gene expression reported by lequette and greenberg 2005 and reis et al 2011 and may result from quorum sensing or the stress conditions such as nutrient deprivation in this region according to the previous studies a main component of the p aeruginosa pao1 biofilm matrix is the polysaccharide psl however this component was not resolved by the nmf analysis this might result from the low content of psl in the mapped area colvin et al 2012 specifically psl was reported to mainly accumulate on the periphery rather than the center of the microcolonies where the raman measurement was performed herein ma et al 2009 3 5 nmf analysis on the hyperspectral images of the p putida biofilm a similar workflow was performed on the hyperspectral raman images of the p putida biofilm matrix the singular value and the evaluation parameters lof and r 2 suggest that there could be 2 3 or 4 components in the p putida biofilm fig s9 according to the residual spectra and the resolved pure spectra calculated by the nmf analysis with different component numbers the 3 component model resulted in the best resolution with the biologically reasonable features figs s10 and s11 the results of the nmf analysis performed on the p putida biofilm matrix are summarized in fig 5 by comparing the pure spectra profiles calculated by nmf with the reference spectra the three components could be identified fig s12 in fig 5a component 1 showed a typical bacterial raman spectrum the raman bands at 1573 a g 1094 po2 and 785 cm 1 c u arose from the nucleic acids in addition the bands at 1664 1258 and 1006 cm 1 were characteristic of the proteins the raman spectrum of component 2 mainly contained the features of proteins including the amide i band at 1651 cm 1 the amide iii band at 1258 cm 1 and the amino acid related bands at 1590 phe trp and tyr 1357 trp and 1006 cm 1 phe andrews et al 2010 meisel et al 2012 the characteristic peaks of nucleic acids such as 1573 1094 and 785 cm 1 were absent component 3 could be undoubtedly assigned to amorphous pha according to the reference spectrum the prominent peaks in the fingerprint region were located at 1737 1062 and 837 cm 1 which were assigned to the stretching vibrations of c o cch3 and ccoo respectively izumi and temperini 2010 the similarity scores between the calculated pure spectra of the p putida biofilm matrix and the reference spectra are shown in table s3 the spectrum of component 1 showed a good match with the spectra of proteins and nucleic acids and the spectrum of component 2 matched well with the spectra of proteins the spectrum of component 3 showed the best match with the raman spectrum of pha and the similarity scores exceeded 0 9 which was much higher than the other similarity scores therefore there were three components present in the p putida biofilm matrix and they could be attributed to bacterial cells protein and pha pha is an intracellular storage material synthesized by various microorganisms and pseudomonas spp are the predominant producer of the medium chain length pha koller and rodriguez contreras 2015 previous studies also reported that p putida dsm 291 atcc 12633 which is exactly the strain we used could produce medium chain length pha under the n limited condition and pha content reached as much as 33 5 and 40 3 of the cell dry matter when using sodium gluconate and sodium octanoate as the carbon source respectively timm and steinbuchel 1990 kroumova et al 2002 wu et al 2003 shahid et al 2013 the 3d organization of the three components in the p putida biofilm matrix was reconstructed and quantitatively analyzed by the corresponding abundance profiles calculated by nmf analysis fig 5b and c in fig 5b the distribution of the biofilm matrix was markedly heterogeneous along the z axis a cavity was present in the region close to the substrate which could be a part of the water channel or the void that prepared the biofilms for further dispersion events ma et al 2009 the bacterial cells component 1 exhibited a relatively high abundance around the upper edge of the cavity as for the proteins component 2 they exhibited the maximum area coverage at the top layers of the biofilm and had a wider distribution in the lower region if compared to the bacterial cells this result suggests that the proteins played an important role in the cell cell interaction the pha component 3 was mainly located in the middle and lower parts of the biofilm matrix and their high abundance might be related to the imbalance of nutrients e g c n in the surrounding environment prieto et al 2016 although pha is supposed to be an intercellular storage material it was not completely co localized with the bacterial cells suggesting that some pha could be released from the lysed bacterial cells and immobilized by the proteins the released pha can be degraded and utilized as a carbon source by the bacterial cells prieto et al 2016 3 6 validation of the nmf analysis results to further validate the nmf analysis results we characterized the biofilm matrix by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm in addition the pseudomonas biofilms were treated with enzymes for various time and the difference raman spectra between the control and the enzyme treated biofilms were calculated and compared with the extracted spectra by nmf analysis fig s13 shows the clsm images of the pseudomonas biofilms stained with toto 1 and syto 63 syto 63 purple color is membrane permeable and could stain both viable and dead cells while toto 1 is membrane impermeable for viable cells and could only stain edna weak and diffuse green color and dead cells bright concentrated green color allesen holm et al 2006 mann et al 2009 okshevsky et al 2014 previous studies reported that edna appeared as a mesh or fuzzy cloud around the bacterial cells mulcahy et al 2008 ma et al 2009 mann et al 2009 tang et al 2013 therefore most of the toto 1 signals in fig s13 seemed to be originated from the dead cells instead of edna in the biofilm matrix the small amount of edna could hardly be resolved by nmf analysis the result was consistent with many previous studies showing that edna was abundant in the early biofilm matrix instead of the mature biofilm matrix allesen holm et al 2006 tang et al 2013 blakeman et al 2019 whitchurch et al 2002 reported that dnase treatment quickly dispersed newly formed biofilms but had little effect on mature biofilms fig s14 shows the distribution of bacterial cells proteins and pha or rhamnolipids in the pseudomonas biofilms syto 63 and fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc could stain the bacterial cells and proteins respectively nile red stained rhamnolipids in p aeruginosa biofilms and pha granules in p putida biofilms in fig s14a while some colocation of red with the purple cell occurs the red fluorescence from rhamnolipids was abundant over most of the field of view morris et al 2011 in fig s14b pha granules can be seen in the p putida biofilm as the red globular structures with strong fluorescence intensity which is consistent with previous studies and our raman results bresan et al 2016 jayakody et al 2018 considering that the amount of edna was relatively low fig s13 and the lipases did not show activity against pha and rhamnolipids the biofilms were treated with proteinase k damasceno et al 2012 tarazona et al 2020 the difference spectra between the control and proteinase treated samples which could be mainly attributed to protein or protein involved complexes in the biofilm matrix were calculated and presented in fig s15a and s15b the protein related spectra calculated by nmf analysis component 2 are also presented in fig s15c and s15d for comparison obviously most of the peak positions in the difference spectra and the nmf extracted spectra were matched however some peak intensities were different which may result from the different experimental instruments we used in addition there might be a correlated change in several molecular component concentration with sampling location and in this case nmf analysis could not guarantee complete separation of these components which possibly result in distorted band intensities yakimov et al 2021 4 conclusions in this work we develop a powerful approach integrating the 3d raman mapping technique with the nmf analysis to in situ characterize the hydrated biofilm matrix the undesired background signal from water can be successfully removed from the raman spectra and the 3d spatial distributions and chemical details of diverse biomolecular components such as proteins bacterial cells glycolipids and pha are unraveled concurrently within the distinct pseudomonas spp biofilm matrix for the hydrated biofilm such information could be hardly obtained simultaneously by other commonly used microscopic techniques without labels therefore we propose to exploit the flexibility of the nmf algorithm to enhance and expand the strengths of raman spectroscopy to probe the biofilm behaviors in the future its ability to remove the background interferences and resolve useful information from raman spectra would significantly contribute to the non targeted and online studies of the hydrated biofilms in more complicated systems such as the membrane biofouling and biological wastewater treatment systems in which water and substrate signals are unavoidable future work will include applying the method described here to investigate the spatially adaptive response of biofilms under a wide variety of experimental conditions which may accelerate the development of targeted antimicrobial strategies additionally considering that many environmental biofilms exhibit fluorescence activity we would also like to develop an approach integrating the surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers and the nmf analysis to investigate the biofilm matrix in the future taking advantage of the in situ nanoparticle synthesis method and the normalization with the surface enhanced elastic scattering as an internal standard various environmental biofilm samples could be

16355,biofilms are ubiquitous in natural and engineered environments and of great importance in drinking water distribution and biological wastewater treatment systems simultaneously acquiring the chemical and structural information of the hydrated biofilm matrix is essential for the cognition and regulation of biofilms in the environmental field however the complexity of samples and the limited approaches prevent a holistic understanding of the biofilm matrix in this work an approach based on the confocal raman mapping technique integrated with non negative matrix factorization nmf analysis was developed to probe the hydrated biofilm matrix in situ the flexibility of the nmf analysis was utilized to subtract the undesired water background signal and resolve the meaningful biological components from raman spectra of the hydrated biofilms diverse chemical components such as proteins bacterial cells glycolipids and polyhydroxyalkanoates pha were unraveled within the distinct pseudomonas spp biofilm matrices and the corresponding 3 dimensional spatial organization was visualized and quantified of these components glycolipids and pha were unique to the p aeruginosa and p putida biofilm matrix respectively furthermore their high abundances in the lower region of the biofilm matrix were found to be related to the specific physiological functions and surrounding microenvironments overall the results demonstrate that our nmf raman mapping method could serve as a powerful tool complementary to the conventional approaches for identifying and visualizing the chemical components in the biofilm matrix this work may facilitate the online characterization of the biofilm matrix widely present in the environment and advance the fundamental understanding of biofilm graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofilm raman mapping non negative matrix factorization pseudomonas putida pseudomonas aeruginosa 1 introduction biofilms are the microbial aggregates embedded in the self produced extracellular polymeric substances eps flemming 2020 they are ubiquitous in natural and engineered environments and are of great importance in a diverse range of disciplines and applications in the fields of environment biotechnology and medicine flemming 2020 rittmann 2018 on the one hand biofilms are widely used in wastewater treatment for nutrient and contaminant removal microbial fuel cells for electricity generation and biocatalysis for chemical production rittmann 2018 on the other hand biofilms are the root causes of a variety of intractable chronic infections and industrial biofouling flemming 2020 therefore we need to advance knowledge of the biofilm matrix to control and make use of them nevertheless the heterogeneity of the chemical composition and spatial structure highly increases the difficulty in investigating the biofilm matrix specifically the chemical constituents vary significantly depending on the microbial species within the biofilm matrix except for the widely known macromolecules such as polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and lipids there are still many organic or inorganic substances within the biofilm matrix that could not be conveniently characterized namely the dark matter seviour et al 2019 moreover the spatial distribution of the various constituents is heterogeneous and intimately related to the microenvironment or physiological functions the structural heterogeneity provides a protective barrier and facilitates the adsorption and storage of the nutrients for biofilm growth flemming and wingender 2010 therefore it is of particular interest to get more information about both the chemical composition and corresponding spatial organization of the biofilm matrix various microscopic methods have been applied to characterize the chemical compositions as well as the three dimensional 3d structure of biofilms simultaneously among them confocal raman microscopy crm has stood out as a potential bioimaging tool to meet these requirements with nondestructive label free and in situ characteristics krafft et al 2017 liu et al 2020 since raman spectroscopy is based on the inelastic light scattering of molecules a wide variety of biomolecules within the biofilm matrix could be detected kusic et al 2015 for example the polyphosphate polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and glycogen involved in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal process were probed by their characteristic raman signals majed and gu 2010 the nucleic acids carotenoids proteins and lipids in the rhodococcus sp sd 74 biofilms were observed by using crm zheng et al 2013 unfortunately most of the existing crm studies on biofilms have focused on the univariate analysis with several specific raman bands which could result in erroneous interpretations of the underlying biochemistry due to the great spectral superposition of the broad molecular constituent classes huang et al 2012 masyuko et al 2014 zheng et al 2013 besides the high information content available in hyperspectral data is not fully exploited to visualize the spatial distributions of all major chemical components yasuda et al 2019 to overcome the shortcomings of the univariate analysis we have very recently developed a methodology integrating crm with non negative matrix factorization nmf analysis to decrypt the development process of the escherichia coli biofilms and successfully elucidated the spatiotemporal changes of the chemical components in the biofilm matrix liu et al 2020 nmf analysis which assumes that the hyperspectral data could be approximated by a linear combination of several spectral components could readily provide physically interpretable spectral components without any a priori information szymanska chargot et al 2016 thanks to the relatively thin and uniform structure the air dried biofilms were successfully probed in the previous work however in most cases the biofilm matrix can be very thick varying in the degree of porosity and having a mushroom like structure or consisting of water channels flemming and wingender 2010 in this case the air drying process probably brings polymer sites closer together and leads to the distortion of the spatial structure zhang et al 2018 therefore the ability to probe the hydrated biofilm matrix would offer a more realistic spatial structure and contribute to the online characterization in the future which is particularly relevant to water treatment and medical studies the major drawback that needs to be overcome to fully exploit raman spectroscopy for the characterization of the hydrated biofilm is the undesired background signals such as the water up to 95 of the biofilm matrix and substrate signal e g coverslip quartz etc sutherland 2001 these interfering signals might reduce the ability to perform stable and robust statistical modeling and thus are desirable to be removed from the original spectral data beier and berger 2009 marro et al 2018 in this work we generalized the method integrating crm with nmf analysis to the hydrated biofilm matrix the chemical and structural information of the distinct hydrated biofilm matrices was captured by crm with the help of a water immersion objective the flexibility of the nmf algorithm was utilized to remove the undesired background signal from water and extract meaningful molecular components from the raman spectra since pseudomonas spp are widespread in natural and engineered water systems and exhibit many unique characteristics e g pathogenicity antibiotic resistance and the capabilities to form biofilms biodegrade pollutants and adapt to a wide range of habitats they have received much attention from researchers in the environmental field mena and gerba 2009 douterelo et al 2013 falkinham et al 2015 lv et al 2017 kurzbaum et al 2017 qi et al 2019 jeanvoine et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 herein two commonly used model species for biofilm formation in the environmental field i e pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida were selected to validate the approach integrating crm and nmf analysis xue et al 2014 lee et al 2017 with nmf analysis the various chemical constituents and their corresponding spatial distribution could be fully resolved in this way the hydrated biofilm matrix could be visualized qualified and quantified which can be useful to understand the biofilm matrix in the environment at the molecular level 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation p aeruginosa pao1 dsm 22644 and p putida dsm 291 were utilized to construct biofilms the stored bacteria cells were cultivated on nutrient agar plates and incubated overnight a single colony was then transferred from the plate into the sterilized luria bertani lb broth and grown overnight in a shaker incubator at 120 rpm the cells were diluted to an optical density od of 0 4 at 600 nm as an inoculum for biofilm growth the inoculum was pipetted into a petri dish with a caf2 substrate and the cells were allowed to settle for 1 h subsequently the p aeruginosa and p putida biofilms were cultivated in 0 02 strength lb broth to create nutrient limited growth conditions xue et al 2014 the biofilms were grown statically and aerobically with the growth medium changed gently every day the incubation temperatures of p aeruginosa and p putida cells at each step were 37 c and 30 c respectively after 4 weeks the biofilms reached maturity with the 3d structure the extra medium was removed from the petri dish and the biofilms were washed twice with sterile water to remove the unattached cells considering that p aeruginosa bacterial cells could possibly produce polysaccharides and polysaccharides usually exhibit raman features in the range from 400 to 600 cm 1 caf2 substrates were used herein to grow biofilms wagner et al 2009 in comparison fused silica exhibits strong and broad bands in this spectral range when immersed in water which could be hardly removed by data processing methods kerr et al 2015 ramoji et al 2016 2 2 3d raman mapping z stack raman images of p aeruginosa and p putida biofilms grown on the caf2 substrates were captured by crm witec gmbh ulm germany the crm was equipped with a 600 lines mm 1 grating and a thermoelectrically cooled ccd detector and the spectral resolution was ca 5 cm 1 since the p aeruginosa and p putida biofilm samples did not exhibit fluorescence activity a wavelength of 514 nm was used for excitation otherwise photobleaching or a longer wavelength laser was recommended to be taken advantage of to eliminate the fluorescence signal macdonald and wyeth 2006 davin et al 2010 meyer et al 2011 in the latter case more integration time stronger laser power and larger confocal aperture could be used to improve the spectral quality trebolazabala et al 2013 kerr et al 2015 in this work the raman spectra were collected through a 60 nikon water immersion objective na 1 0 with the laser power of 8 mw silge et al 2016 the biofilm samples were scanned over an area of 20 μm 20 μm in the center of the microcolonies with x y direction steps of 0 5 μm and an integration time of 2 s per spectrum to avoid the escape of bacterial cells from the biofilm matrix and ensure the integrity of the biofilm matrices a mapping time of less than 16 h should be used considering that the thicknesses of the p aeruginosa and p putida biofilm matrices were around 96 μm and 22 μm respectively the z direction step was 8 μm for p aeruginosa and 2 μm for p putida figs s1 and s2 show the bright field images of the biofilm matrices and the results of hierarchical clustering analysis hca of the average spectra from different layers respectively the spatial distribution and the chemical information of the adjacent layers separated by a distance of 8 μm were quite similar indicating that the adequate chemical and spatial information could be provided with a z direction step of 8 μm for the calibration procedure the raman spectra of a wavenumber standard e g 4 acetamidophenol were captured daily before the mapping measurement dörfer et al 2011 2 3 data analysis and chemometric methods data analysis was performed with an in house written script based on gnu r and the nnlm package was utilized for the nmf analysis lin and boutros 2020 team 2013 the process is summarized in fig 1 firstly the hyperspectral images of the biofilm samples captured at various depths were unfolded and assembled into a matrix a υ m eq 1 herein υ represents the number of data points per spectrum along with the wavenumber axis and m is the number of spectra in the dataset which is equal to x y z a i i 1 2 z is the spectral submatrix of the it h layer consisting of υ rows and x y columns for instance the z stack images of the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix consisted of 13 layers and each layer contained x y 40 40 points then there were m x y z 40 40 13 20 800 spectra in the hyperspectral dataset of the p aeruginosa biofilm 1 a a 1 a 2 a z the obtained hyperspectral matrix was then preprocessed including removal of cosmic spikes by comparing the raman spectra that were measured successively baseline correction with the snip algorithm and wavenumber calibration based on the spectrum of the standard material 4 acetaminophenol bocklitz et al 2011 dörfer et al 2011 liu et al 2020 since almost all the chemical components of interest exhibit unique features in the fingerprint region and the water signal is also relatively weak in this region the preprocessed spectral matrix was truncated to the spectral region from 500 to 1850 cm 1 morais et al 2020 the nmf analysis was then performed on the preprocessed hyperspectral dataset to remove the background signal from water and it could be expressed as 2 a wh w 0 h 1 e where a is the preprocessed hyperspectral matrix w 0 is the known water signal profiles which only exhibited the oh related peaks i e oh bending vibration mode at 1643 cm 1 owing to the large amount of water in the hydrated biofilms the water spectral profiles could be originated from the matrix a or directly measured w is the raman spectral profiles of the other chemical components in the biofilm matrix and its column number is the number of the other chemical components k duraipandian et al 2018 tsubaki et al 2019 lin and boutros 2020 an approximate estimation of k could be obtained using the singular value decomposition svd analysis h and h 1 are the corresponding concentration profiles of w and w 0 e is the error matrix reflecting the residual of the dataset that was not related to any chemical contributions given a w 0 and the number of other components k w h and h 1 could be estimated by minimizing the term 1 2 e f 2 with the constraint of w 0 and h 0 the minimization problem can be quickly solved using the alternating non negative least squares anls approach incorporated with the sequential coordinate wise descent scd algorithm liu et al 2020 lin and boutros 2020 indeed one can treat the known spectral profiles w 0 as a form of hard regularization in this step and the corresponding concentration profile h 1 could be calculated by nmf analysis in order to remove the water signals and obtain the chemical composition of biofilm matrix the spectral contribution of w 0 h 1 was directly subtracted from the preprocessed hyperspectral matrix a eq 3 the reconstructed hyperspectral dataset was noted as a which would provide greater visibility of some subtle spectral changes inherent to the macromolecules in the biofilm matrix and may also contribute to building a statistical model with chemically meaningful output kuligowski et al 2011 marro et al 2018 3 a a w 0 h 1 the reconstructed matrix a was vector normalized and smoothed by the 9 point savitzky golay algorithm the spectral features remained almost unchanged after smoothing fig s3 then the spectra from the same z layer were averaged and the average spectra of different layers were compared to provide a preliminary understanding of the vertical changes of the chemical composition in the biofilm matrix the average spectra of different layers of the p aeruginosa biofilm were additionally subjected to the hca analysis and the results indicates that the chemical information of the adjacent layers was quite similar fig s2 the nmf analysis was performed again on the reconstructed hyperspectral matrix a to resolve the pure spectral profiles of chemical components involved in the biofilm matrix w and their corresponding concentration matrix h eq 4 4 a w e the optimal number of the chemical component k in matrix a was estimated by svd analysis the evaluation parameters lack of fit lof and variance explained r 2 and the residual spectra liu et al 2020 finally to identify the chemical meanings of the extracted spectra they were compared with the reference spectra of the common biological molecules the spectral similarity was evaluated by the spectral angle metric which is based on the cosine of the angle between the calculated spectra and the reference spectra schollee et al 2017 the similarity score r ranges from 0 to 1 and 1 represents a perfect match eq 5 5 r s a s b s a s b i 1 υ s a i s b i i 1 υ s a i 2 i 1 υ s b i 2 herein sa and sb are the raman signals of compound a pure spectra resolved by nmf analysis and b reference spectra respectively the term υ represents the number of data points per spectrum along with the wavenumber axis and s a i and s b i are the raman intensities of compounds a and b at the i th wavenumber respectively the calculated concentration profile h was used to reconstruct the 3d spatial distribution of the chemical components via amira a threshold was selected automatically by the isodata algorithm for image segmentation heydorn et al 2000 the pixels with the abundance above the threshold were deemed to be related to biomass and thus were counted to obtain the area coverage 3 results and discussion 3 1 raman spectra of the reference samples polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and lipids are the major components of the biofilm matrix thus various nucleic acids dna and rna from different species of bacteria polysaccharides starch na alginate dextran and cellulose proteins ovalbumin bovine serum albumin and lysozyme and lipids phosphatidylethanolamine mycolic acid trimyristin and triolein were measured as reference substances to interpret the raman spectra of the biofilm matrix fig s4 the band assignment of the reference substances is summarized in table s1 raman spectra of the nucleic acids from various microorganisms were quite similar and exhibited features at 1665 t 1585 1570 a g 1484 a g 1416 ch2 deformation 1371 a g t 1340 1330 a 1100 1090 po2 785 780 c u 730 720 a and 675 cm 1 t g benevides et al 2005 kuhar et al 2018 the phosphate mode at 1100 1090 cm 1 is typical for the nucleic acids and has been utilized to quantify the nucleic acids in the cell nucleus kuhar et al 2018 for the tested polysaccharides their raman spectra varied significantly owing to the different structures the fingerprint bands of polysaccharides were mainly located in 3 regions ch ch2 deformational motions at 1500 1200 cm 1 cc stretch coc glucosidic link and ring breathing modes at 1200 950 cm 1 and side group e g coh cch och deformations at 950 700 cm 1 moreover coo stretching modes 1650 1540 1450 1360 cm 1 were characteristic for polyanionic polysaccharides such as na alginate wagner et al 2009 the 1200 700 cm 1 region of polysaccharides exhibited signals of moderate to high intensity and was particularly suited to discriminate polysaccharides from other important classes of biomolecules such as proteins or lipids wagner et al 2009 wiercigroch et al 2017 raman spectra of proteins showed characteristic bands in the regions of 1700 1580 cm 1 amide i 1620 1605 cm 1 tyr trp phe and 1300 1200 cm 1 amide iii rygula et al 2013 the sharp band at 1004 cm 1 was assigned to phe for the tested lipids the most characteristic features were located at 1500 1400 cm 1 1300 1250 cm 1 and 1200 1050 cm 1 which were related to the presence of the hydrocarbon chain c o ester stretching vibrations 1750 1700 cm 1 and c c stretching vibrations 1660 1650 cm 1 were likely present in the spectra of some unsaturated lipids additionally the po2 symmetric stretching vibration of phospholipid was located at 1085 cm 1 czamara et al 2015 3 2 water background subtraction by nmf analysis with 4 week incubation the biofilms of p aeruginosa and p putida became heterogeneous and had a 3d structure indicating that the biofilms reached the mature stage the 3d raman images of the two types of hydrated biofilms were captured by crm since water is the dominant component of the biofilm matrix up to 95 the subtraction of the water signal could lead to a larger visibility of the subtle spectral changes inherent to the biofilm spectra making it easier to resolve the other chemical meaningful components and quantify their spatial distribution beier and berger 2009 marro et al 2018 sutherland 2001 the hyperspectral dataset of the biofilm matrix a was fed into the nmf analysis with the water signals as w 0 given a and w 0 h w and h 1 could be calculated using the anls approach incorporated with the scd algorithm lin and boutros 2020 subsequently direct subtraction of the water signals nmf loadings w 0 multiplied by the corresponding concentration matrix nmf scores h 1 was performed to remove the water signals from the hyperspectral dataset the averaged spectra of the optical slices before and after the subtraction of the water signals are presented in fig 2 suggesting that the spectral contribution of water was successfully removed the ability of nmf analysis to remove the undesired background signals was also reported by several previous studies kunc et al 2013 marro et al 2018 tan et al 2019 lobanova and lobanov 2019 for instance lobanova and lobanov 2019 reported that the nmf method was particularly useful to eliminate the contribution of wax residues to the spectral basis for paraffin embedded samples 3 3 raman spectra of the biofilms formed by p aeruginosa and p putida after the subtraction of the water signal the spectra of each optical slice were vector normalized and averaged to give a preliminary impression of the biofilm matrix as shown in fig 3 the layer close to the substrate surface was deemed as 0 μm bottom layer according to the previous studies and table s1 the raman features of the biofilm matrix are related to the macromolecules e g proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids and lipids kusic et al 2015 wagner et al 2009 in the raman spectra of the p aeruginosa biofilm fig 3a the protein related peaks are at 1664 amide i 1249 amide iii and 1006 cm 1 phe nucleic acids associated bands are at 1582 a g 1339 a 1094 po2 and 785 cm 1 c u and the signal at 1126 cm 1 cc stretching coc glycosidic link symmetric ring breathing arises from the polysaccharides due to the existence of ch2 and ch3 groups in all macromolecules the raman spectra also contain the ch2 deformation vibrations at 1455 cm 1 kusic et al 2015 the average spectra of different sampling depth in the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix were similar and exhibited only minor variations indicating that the mature biofilm formed by p aeruginosa was relatively homogenous compared to the raman spectra of the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix the spectra of the p putida biofilm matrix consisted of several additional peaks at 1737 1062 and 837 cm 1 which might be associated with the emergence of pha fig 3b moreover the spectra of the p putida biofilm matrix varied significantly with depth suggesting the heterogeneous distribution of the chemical constituents for example the nucleic acid related features at 785 cm 1 exhibited strong signals in the upper region while the pha associated peaks were intense in the lower region close to the caf2 substrate 3 4 nmf analysis on the hyperspectral images of the p aeruginosa biofilm considering the great spectral superposition of various macromolecules it is difficult to unambiguously assign the specific raman bands of the biofilms to the known biomolecules and quantify the content of each chemical species hence the nmf analysis was conducted to extract the chemical information within the biofilm matrix based on the clean hyperspectral dataset without water contribution the svd analysis and the nmf analysis with 1 2 3 4 and 5 components were performed and the corresponding singular value and the evaluation parameters lof and r 2 are presented in fig s5 according to the singular value there could be 2 3 or 4 chemical components in the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix the lof and r 2 varied significantly from 2 to 3 components and less from 3 to 4 components moreover the pure spectral profiles and the residual spectral matrix calculated by the nmf analysis with 2 3 and 4 component models are displayed in fig s6 to give a direct impression of the fitting performance with different component numbers the typical raman spectra of the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix and the corresponding residual spectra of nmf analysis with 1 2 3 4 and 5 component models are presented in fig s7 based on the residual spectra shown in figs s6 and s7 the addition of the 3rd component showed a notable improvement of the fitting performance especially in the spectral region of 1800 1200 cm 1 while the addition of the 4th component did not the almost identical residual spectra of nmf analysis with 3 4 and 5 compoent models indicate the possible presence of overfitting with the addition of the 4th and 5th components in addition there seems to be some self contradicts in the pure spectra extracted by 4 component nmf analysis for instance the spectrum of component 2 extracted by the 4 component nmf analysis exhibited the strong peaks at around 1642 and 1582 cm 1 indicating that the component should be related to proteins and nucleic acids however the other peaks related to proteins and nucleic acids e g 1006 phe 1094 po2 and 785 cm 1 c u were absent in this spectrum therefore from the perspectives of fitting performance and the biological meanings of the extracted spectra there should be 3 main components in the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix the results of the 3 component nmf analysis of the p aeruginosa hyperspectral images are summarized in fig 4 including the pure spectral profiles spatial organization and the distribution of area coverage with distinct sampling depths to explicitly assign the nmf resolved spectra we compared the pure spectrum of each component with the reference spectra of proteins polysaccharides dna and glycolipids fig s8 component 1 represented a typical raman spectrum of bacteria the characteristic bands related to the proteins are located at 1664 amide i 1249 amide iii and 1006 cm 1 phe and those related to the nucleic acids are located at 1582 a g 1094 po2 and 785 cm 1 c u component 2 should be associated with proteins according to the peaks at 1664 1249 and 1006 cm 1 the nucleic acids relevant features at 1582 1094 and 785 cm 1 were not apparent compared to the reference spectra of lipids polysaccharides and glycolipids component 3 was tentatively assigned to glycolipids the signals at 1163 cc coc glycosidic link asymmetric ring breathing 1126 cc coc glycosidic link symmetric ring breathing 894 cc coc 1 4 glycosidic link and 861 cm 1 cc cocc 1 4 glycosidic link were related to the polysaccharides the peak at 1308 ch2 ch3 seemed to be the overlap of the broad vibrational band of polysaccharides and a sharp band of lipids and quite similar to the peak of glycolipids leu et al 2020 the features at 1737 c o 1660 c o c c and 1076 cm 1 coh ch were possibly assigned to polysaccharides or lipids wagner et al 2009 in the context of pseudomonas derived biofilms the features at 1163 and 1126 cm 1 were consistent in the presence of rhamnolipids a major class of glycolipids produced by pseudomonas spp and regulated by quorum sensing khademolhosseini et al 2019 masyuko et al 2014 singh and tiwary 2016 additionally the similarity scores between the resolved pure spectra of the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix and the reference spectra are presented in table s2 component 1 matched well with the nucleic acid and proteins and component 2 matched well with proteins as for component 3 it showed a good match with the glycolipid and lipids therefore there were three main components i e bacterial cells proteins and glycolipids in the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix and the glycolipid signal might be assigned to rhamnolipids masyuko et al 2014 investigated the p aeruginosa biofilm by crm and found out that there were a large number of proteins and glycolipids in the mature biofilm and the glycolipids signal was further confirmed to possibly originate from the rhamnolipids by the matrix assisted laser desorption mass spectroscopy in addition lanni et al 2014 have also detected a huge variety of rhamnolipids in the p aeruginosa biofilm as a secondary metabolic product rhamnolipids were reported to abound in the mature p aeruginosa biofilm matrix especially in the interior region facilitating the immigration of bacterial cells the formation of mushroom like structure the maintenance of the water channel as well as the biofilm dispersion heacock kang et al 2017 pamp and tolker nielsen 2007 the 3d spatial distribution of the three components derived from the nmf analysis is shown in fig 4b it is worth noting that in view of the changes of the focal plane the acquired raman spectra were vector normalized thus fig 4b reflects the relative concentration distribution of the three components the isodata method was used to automatically segment the abundance distribution image into the biomass and voids and the number of pixels associated with biomass was counted to obtain the area coverage which is shown in fig 4c component 1 i e the bacterial cells showed relatively higher area coverages within the top and bottom biofilm layers components 2 proteins and 3 glycolipids were mainly distributed in the top and bottom layers of the biofilm matrix respectively this observation may suggest that proteins were closely related to the oxygen and nutrition availability and might play an important role in the cell cell interaction lee and yoon 2017 wei and ma 2013 xu et al 1998 recent studies have shown that a large number of proteins were present in the p aeruginosa biofilm providing the structural scaffolds and active functional networks reichhardt and parsek 2019 the existence of glycolipids in the bottom region of the p aeruginosa biofilm matrix was in good agreement with the localization of the rhamnolipid synthesis gene expression reported by lequette and greenberg 2005 and reis et al 2011 and may result from quorum sensing or the stress conditions such as nutrient deprivation in this region according to the previous studies a main component of the p aeruginosa pao1 biofilm matrix is the polysaccharide psl however this component was not resolved by the nmf analysis this might result from the low content of psl in the mapped area colvin et al 2012 specifically psl was reported to mainly accumulate on the periphery rather than the center of the microcolonies where the raman measurement was performed herein ma et al 2009 3 5 nmf analysis on the hyperspectral images of the p putida biofilm a similar workflow was performed on the hyperspectral raman images of the p putida biofilm matrix the singular value and the evaluation parameters lof and r 2 suggest that there could be 2 3 or 4 components in the p putida biofilm fig s9 according to the residual spectra and the resolved pure spectra calculated by the nmf analysis with different component numbers the 3 component model resulted in the best resolution with the biologically reasonable features figs s10 and s11 the results of the nmf analysis performed on the p putida biofilm matrix are summarized in fig 5 by comparing the pure spectra profiles calculated by nmf with the reference spectra the three components could be identified fig s12 in fig 5a component 1 showed a typical bacterial raman spectrum the raman bands at 1573 a g 1094 po2 and 785 cm 1 c u arose from the nucleic acids in addition the bands at 1664 1258 and 1006 cm 1 were characteristic of the proteins the raman spectrum of component 2 mainly contained the features of proteins including the amide i band at 1651 cm 1 the amide iii band at 1258 cm 1 and the amino acid related bands at 1590 phe trp and tyr 1357 trp and 1006 cm 1 phe andrews et al 2010 meisel et al 2012 the characteristic peaks of nucleic acids such as 1573 1094 and 785 cm 1 were absent component 3 could be undoubtedly assigned to amorphous pha according to the reference spectrum the prominent peaks in the fingerprint region were located at 1737 1062 and 837 cm 1 which were assigned to the stretching vibrations of c o cch3 and ccoo respectively izumi and temperini 2010 the similarity scores between the calculated pure spectra of the p putida biofilm matrix and the reference spectra are shown in table s3 the spectrum of component 1 showed a good match with the spectra of proteins and nucleic acids and the spectrum of component 2 matched well with the spectra of proteins the spectrum of component 3 showed the best match with the raman spectrum of pha and the similarity scores exceeded 0 9 which was much higher than the other similarity scores therefore there were three components present in the p putida biofilm matrix and they could be attributed to bacterial cells protein and pha pha is an intracellular storage material synthesized by various microorganisms and pseudomonas spp are the predominant producer of the medium chain length pha koller and rodriguez contreras 2015 previous studies also reported that p putida dsm 291 atcc 12633 which is exactly the strain we used could produce medium chain length pha under the n limited condition and pha content reached as much as 33 5 and 40 3 of the cell dry matter when using sodium gluconate and sodium octanoate as the carbon source respectively timm and steinbuchel 1990 kroumova et al 2002 wu et al 2003 shahid et al 2013 the 3d organization of the three components in the p putida biofilm matrix was reconstructed and quantitatively analyzed by the corresponding abundance profiles calculated by nmf analysis fig 5b and c in fig 5b the distribution of the biofilm matrix was markedly heterogeneous along the z axis a cavity was present in the region close to the substrate which could be a part of the water channel or the void that prepared the biofilms for further dispersion events ma et al 2009 the bacterial cells component 1 exhibited a relatively high abundance around the upper edge of the cavity as for the proteins component 2 they exhibited the maximum area coverage at the top layers of the biofilm and had a wider distribution in the lower region if compared to the bacterial cells this result suggests that the proteins played an important role in the cell cell interaction the pha component 3 was mainly located in the middle and lower parts of the biofilm matrix and their high abundance might be related to the imbalance of nutrients e g c n in the surrounding environment prieto et al 2016 although pha is supposed to be an intercellular storage material it was not completely co localized with the bacterial cells suggesting that some pha could be released from the lysed bacterial cells and immobilized by the proteins the released pha can be degraded and utilized as a carbon source by the bacterial cells prieto et al 2016 3 6 validation of the nmf analysis results to further validate the nmf analysis results we characterized the biofilm matrix by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm in addition the pseudomonas biofilms were treated with enzymes for various time and the difference raman spectra between the control and the enzyme treated biofilms were calculated and compared with the extracted spectra by nmf analysis fig s13 shows the clsm images of the pseudomonas biofilms stained with toto 1 and syto 63 syto 63 purple color is membrane permeable and could stain both viable and dead cells while toto 1 is membrane impermeable for viable cells and could only stain edna weak and diffuse green color and dead cells bright concentrated green color allesen holm et al 2006 mann et al 2009 okshevsky et al 2014 previous studies reported that edna appeared as a mesh or fuzzy cloud around the bacterial cells mulcahy et al 2008 ma et al 2009 mann et al 2009 tang et al 2013 therefore most of the toto 1 signals in fig s13 seemed to be originated from the dead cells instead of edna in the biofilm matrix the small amount of edna could hardly be resolved by nmf analysis the result was consistent with many previous studies showing that edna was abundant in the early biofilm matrix instead of the mature biofilm matrix allesen holm et al 2006 tang et al 2013 blakeman et al 2019 whitchurch et al 2002 reported that dnase treatment quickly dispersed newly formed biofilms but had little effect on mature biofilms fig s14 shows the distribution of bacterial cells proteins and pha or rhamnolipids in the pseudomonas biofilms syto 63 and fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc could stain the bacterial cells and proteins respectively nile red stained rhamnolipids in p aeruginosa biofilms and pha granules in p putida biofilms in fig s14a while some colocation of red with the purple cell occurs the red fluorescence from rhamnolipids was abundant over most of the field of view morris et al 2011 in fig s14b pha granules can be seen in the p putida biofilm as the red globular structures with strong fluorescence intensity which is consistent with previous studies and our raman results bresan et al 2016 jayakody et al 2018 considering that the amount of edna was relatively low fig s13 and the lipases did not show activity against pha and rhamnolipids the biofilms were treated with proteinase k damasceno et al 2012 tarazona et al 2020 the difference spectra between the control and proteinase treated samples which could be mainly attributed to protein or protein involved complexes in the biofilm matrix were calculated and presented in fig s15a and s15b the protein related spectra calculated by nmf analysis component 2 are also presented in fig s15c and s15d for comparison obviously most of the peak positions in the difference spectra and the nmf extracted spectra were matched however some peak intensities were different which may result from the different experimental instruments we used in addition there might be a correlated change in several molecular component concentration with sampling location and in this case nmf analysis could not guarantee complete separation of these components which possibly result in distorted band intensities yakimov et al 2021 4 conclusions in this work we develop a powerful approach integrating the 3d raman mapping technique with the nmf analysis to in situ characterize the hydrated biofilm matrix the undesired background signal from water can be successfully removed from the raman spectra and the 3d spatial distributions and chemical details of diverse biomolecular components such as proteins bacterial cells glycolipids and pha are unraveled concurrently within the distinct pseudomonas spp biofilm matrix for the hydrated biofilm such information could be hardly obtained simultaneously by other commonly used microscopic techniques without labels therefore we propose to exploit the flexibility of the nmf algorithm to enhance and expand the strengths of raman spectroscopy to probe the biofilm behaviors in the future its ability to remove the background interferences and resolve useful information from raman spectra would significantly contribute to the non targeted and online studies of the hydrated biofilms in more complicated systems such as the membrane biofouling and biological wastewater treatment systems in which water and substrate signals are unavoidable future work will include applying the method described here to investigate the spatially adaptive response of biofilms under a wide variety of experimental conditions which may accelerate the development of targeted antimicrobial strategies additionally considering that many environmental biofilms exhibit fluorescence activity we would also like to develop an approach integrating the surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers and the nmf analysis to investigate the biofilm matrix in the future taking advantage of the in situ nanoparticle synthesis method and the normalization with the surface enhanced elastic scattering as an internal standard various environmental biofilm samples could be

16356,in recent months wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been shown to be an important tool for early detection of sars cov 2 circulation in the population in this study a detection methodology for sars cov 2 rna wildtype and variants of concern in wastewater was developed based on the detection of different target genes e and orf1ab by polyethylene glycol peg precipitation and digital droplet pcr this methodology was used to determine the sars cov 2 concentration and the proportion of n501y mutation in raw sewage of the wastewater treatment plant of the city of karlsruhe in south western germany over a period of 1 year june 2020 to july 2021 comparison of sars cov 2 concentrations with reported covid 19 cases in the catchment area showed a significant correlation as the clinical sars cov 2 official case report chain takes time viral rna titre trends appeared more than 12 days earlier than clinical data demonstrating the potential of wastewater based epidemiology as an early warning system parallel pcr analysis using seven primer and probe systems revealed similar gene copy numbers with e orf rdrp2 and nsp9 assays rdpp1 and nsp3 generally resulted in lower copy numbers and in particular for n1 there was low correlation with the other assays the occurrence of the n501y mutation in the wastewater of karlsruhe was consistent with the occurrence of the alpha variant b 1 1 7 in the corresponding individual clinical tests in batch experiments sars cov 2 rna was stable for several days under anaerobic conditions but the copy numbers decreased rapidly in the presence of dissolved oxygen overall this study shows that wastewater based epidemiology is a sensitive and robust approach to detect trends in the spread of sars cov 2 at an early stage contributing

capacity and without a functioning reporting system such as developing countries kitajima et al 2020 in addition wastewater surveillance can help detect variations in circulating strains allowing

wastewater using pcr based methods multiple sets of pcr primers and probes have been published targeting different locations of the genome such as the s n and e gene chu et al 2020 corman et al 2020 us cdc 2020 for diagnostic testing evaluations of primer and probe sets used in sars cov 2 rt qpcr detection assays were already performed vogels et al 2020 while one of these clinical studies showed a high similarity in the analytical sensitivities for the different assays vogels et al 2020 other studies identified primer probe sets that showed higher sensitivity than others jung et al 2020 nalla

wastewater monitoring cervantes avilés et al 2021 which is a quantitative pcr method allowing an absolute quantification of dna or rna by using ddpcr a higher sensitivity can be achieved compared to qpcr since pcr inhibitors and the competition of background dna and target molecules play a negligible role rački et al 2014 the genome of the sars cov 2 virus is subject to a high mutation rate mutations are distributed across the genome and either have no effect on the phenotype silent mutation or can lead to altered infectivity and pathogenicity mercatelli and giorgi 2020 at the end of

patients bogler et al 2020 this viral rna reaches the wastewater treatment plant wwtp via the sewer system where composite samples for wastewater monitoring are usually taken from the influent however relatively little is known about the stability of sars cov 2 rna in sewer systems hart and halden 2020 in general stability is strongly influenced by various environmental factors such as temperature ph biological activity or solid content foladori et al 2020 in laboratory experiments significantly higher reductions were determined at higher temperatures ahmed et al 2020b gundy et al 2009 coronaviruses are enveloped viruses and an intact envelope is important for virus pathogenicity mandala et al 2020 overall there are indications that enveloped viruses are less resistant to

conditions e g ph lipid solvents disinfectants mohan et al 2021 scheller et al 2020 in contrast the capsid protein is probably less subjected to lipid solvents temperature and ph changes although so far little information is available on its stability in this context the aims of this study were i to establish a robust wastewater monitoring procedure including the evaluation of different target genes and the use of digital droplet pcr ii to apply the wbe approach in southern germany iii to determine the distribution of sars cov 2 variants and iv to investigate the stability of its genome in wastewater samples this study was designed to contribute to the assessment of the sensitivity and robustness of sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance and therefore to pandemic and post pandemic management 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites sample collection and storage long term monitoring was performed between june 2020 and july 2021 at the wwtp of the city of karlsruhe karlsruhe is the second largest city of the german federal state baden württemberg and located in south western germany the wwtp of karlsruhe has a capacity of 850 000 population equivalents and treats the sewage of about 370 000 people we collected 24 h composite samples from 0 to 12 pm twice a week using a flow proportional auto sampler the collected samples were homogenised using the dispersing and homogenizing tool minibatch d 9 miccra gmbh and transported to the laboratory at 4 c upon arrival the samples were concentrated and analysed according to the method described below in total 89 samples were taken in the study area as duplicates wastewater samples from other sites in southern germany leonberg baden wuerttemberg and berchtesgadener land bavaria were also used for the evaluation of different target genes 802 samples in total table 1 2 2 sample processing 2 2 1 concentration for sample concentration a volume of 45 ml of wastewater sample was centrifuged 30 min 5000 g to settle larger particles the supernatant was than concentrated using peg nacl precipitation as described by wu et al 2020 with slight modifications briefly 10 w v peg 8000 carl roth and 2 25 nacl w v carl roth were added to the sample and mixed the mixture was agitated on a shaking incubator at 120 rpm for 2 h on ice and subsequently samples were centrifuged at 20 000 g for 2 h at 4 c the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 600 μl pcr grade water thermofisher scientific for all samples two independent replicates were analysed recovery of viruses by the peg precipitation was determined using phi6 bacteriophage as a surrogate for enveloped viruses using spiked samples the phi6 recoveries were approx 26 using peg precipitation in the first phase of the study sars cov 2 rna in particle bound and the dissolved portion were processed in parallel for the solid phase the pellet of 45 ml wastewater was resuspended in 600 µl of pcr grade water and nucleic acid extraction was performed according to section 2 2 2 however since the measured sars cov 2 concentration in the solid phase was at least 0 7 log levels lower than in the liquid phase the solid phase was not taken into account for trend analysis 2 2 2 nucleic acid extraction nucleic acids were extracted directly after concentration using the innuprep virus dna rna kit ipc16 analytik jena gmbh as described by the manufacturer protocol for isolation from 600 µl cell free body fluid extracted nucleic acids were eluted in a final volume of 100 µl and analysed immediately or stored at 80 c in case of the four main assays n1 e orf rdrp1 all ddpcr reactions were performed within a week analysis using further primer and probes set were performed later with a maximum storage time of six month parallel to these analyses the e and orf assays were repeated a comparison of the results for e and orf analysed at the two different time points showed variations within the standard deviation of the ddpcr and no degradation of the rna over the storage period 2 2 3 reverse transcription and pcr detection the sars cov 2 specific sequences were quantified using one step reverse transcription rt ddpcr for the pcr analyses seven primers probe sets were compared table 2 all wastewater samples were analysed using two duplex pcr assays with the primers and probe sets 1 4 additional investigations of selected samples for the evaluation of alternative primers and probes set 5 7 and the detection of the n501y mutation and wildtype sets 8 and 9 were carried out all primers and probes were obtained from thermofisher scientific the ddpcr was performed on the qx200 droplet digital pcr system biorad using the one step rt ddpcr advanced kit for probes biorad reactions were set up in a final volume of 20 µl following the manufacturer s instructions using 3 µl of nucleic acid extract the reaction mixture consisted of one step rt ddpcr supermix biorad 20 units µl reverse transcriptase biorad 15 mm dtt biorad 900 nm primer forward and reverse 250 nm probe and rnase free water the mixture was combined with 70 μl droplet generation oil in the droplet generator biorad and the resulting droplets were transferred to a 96 well plate for pcr cycling cycling conditions were as follows 60 min reverse transcription at 42 c 1 cycle 10 min enzyme activation at 95 c 1 cycle 30 s denaturation at 95 c 1 min annealing extension cycle at 55 c 40 cycles 10 min enzyme deactivation at 98 c 1 cycle and a hold step at 4 c until reading on the qx100 droplet reader biorad data analysis was performed with the quantasoft software biorad no template control and a positive control synthetic rna 4blqsars cov 2 rna 4base lab ag were included in each ddpcr assay quantasoft and quantasoft analysis pro biorad were used to manually threshold and export the data the number of accepted droplets was 13 000 on average and similar for all gene targets analyses with a droplet number below 8000 were repeated with an additional tenfold dilution in accordance with the digital miqe guidelines dmiqe group and huggett 2020 due to this procedure more than 8000 droplets could always be generated in the repetition tests for possible inhibition in ddpcr were performed with ten and hundredfold diluted samples in pcr grade water showing no inhibitory effects diluted samples had an average of 5 deviation from the undiluted samples concentrations per reaction were converted to copies per ml of wastewater all detections were performed in the same lab and with the same methods previous reports showed an actual detection limit of 3 copies per reaction for the ddpcr alteri et al 2020 in this case the detection limit also represents the limit of quantification based on the initial volume of wastewater and the volume of rna extract used in our study a detection limit of 2 5 gene copies per ml of wastewater without taking into account the losses during concentration and extraction was calculated 2 3 covid 19 cases in the model area epidemiological data on covid 19 cases in the studied area were retrieved from the daily report on covid 19 infections in the city and districts of karlsruhe https corona karlsruhe de aktuelle fallzahlen which is based on official data of the federal robert koch institute in charge of public health surveillance in addition the association of accredited laboratories in medicine alm e v submit the number of variant specific pcr examinations for baden württemberg on a weekly basis reports containing this data are published regularly by the state health office of baden württemberg 2 4 statistical analysis basic mathematical calculations mean median sliding average regression and p tests were performed in microsoft excel 14 0 7212 5 to compare trends for the results of different gene targets e g n1 and e a linear regression statistic was performed with and without regression models forced through zero 2 5 biomarker stability tests batch experiments were established in 1 l glass bottles using untreated wastewater from the wwtp of karlsruhe the 24 hr composite sample of the previous day 4 l was transported to the laboratory and directly used for the experiment overall six test bottles containing 600 ml of wastewater were set up three bottles with wastewater were purged with ambient air using aquarium pumps and the other three bottles were purged with nitrogen gas for ten minutes and then sealed immediately the bottles were incubated at room temperature samples were taken to determine dissolved oxygen do and ph using a wtw meter 36 020 ids with optical sensor fdo 925 and ph electrode sentrix from xylem analytics after each sampling the wastewater was purged again with ambient air or nitrogen for five minutes the pcr samples 40 ml were processed using the vac man laboratory vacuum manifold promega and the maxwell rsc enviro wastewater tna kit promega 3 results and discussion 3 1 suitability of four different primer and probe systems the ddpcr data for a total of 802 field samples including results for four primer and probe sets targeting n e orf and rdrp genes 2019 ncov n1 e sarbeco hku orf1b nsp14 rdrp sars hereinafter referred to as n1 e orf and rdrp1 were compared fig 1 the coefficient of variation of independent replicates was 26 using n1 94 of the samples gave a positive result for other primer and probe combinations the proportion of positive detections were considerably lower 62 for e 54 for orf and 20 for rdrp1 a similar trend was observed for average gene copy numbers with highest values for n1 and lowest one for rdrp1 median over all values were 27 5 11 8 11 5 and 8 5 gene copies per ml for n1 e orf and rdrp1 respectively in particular for n1 we observed several results much higher than those measured in samples days before and after these peaks did not appear in the e orf and rdrp assays in some cases the n1 values were more than 2 log10 levels higher than the values obtained by the other assays linear regression between the data fig 1 did show low correlation coefficients or no significance p 0 05 for all combinations with the n1 primer probe set the e and orf correlated well with orf giving slightly lower values as compared to e slope 1 24 at r² 0 96 p 0 001 and n 399 both e and orf gave higher slope values of 2 83 and 2 29 compared to rdrp1 indicating a noticeable difference to exclude internal errors for the n1 assay these extreme values were confirmed by additional replicates the copy numbers of the four tested assays differed showing the following order n1 e orf rdrp1 it was hypothesized that the differences in the gene copy numbers may be caused by variations in assay sensitivity or the localization and stability of the target genes on the sars cov 2 genome the second hypothesis was supported by the preliminary observation that the gene copy numbers decreased towards the 5 end indicating a preferential degradation of the sars cov 2 genome from the 5 end this hypothesis was tested with additional primers on the same sample set see section 3 3 for the same primers differences between gene copy numbers or ct values have also been reported previously for example vogels et al 2020 observed similar ct values for n1 e and orf but higher ct values for rdrp1 in clinical samples similar findings with n1 e and rdrp1 have been reported by muenchhoff et al 2020 for stool samples and for e and rdrp1 in wastewater samples bertrand et al 2021 higher copy numbers corresponding to lower ct values for the n1 primers in wastewater have been reported by gerrity et al 2021 in comparison to n2 e and orf by pérez cataluña et al 2021 in comparison to n2 and e by randazzo et al 2020 for n2 and n3 as well as by fernandez cassi et al 2021 and peccia et al 2020 for n2 due to low values using rdrp1 and the high outliers using n1 wbe data reporting in our study was performed using only e and orf similar decisions have been made by gonzalez et al 2020 and westhaus et al 2021 both studies excluded n1 for wastewater monitoring considering the observed effects in our study initial comparison of detection methods and the parallel detection of at least two sars cov 2 specific genes is recommended to assure reliable wbe 3 2 results of the wbe for the city of karlsruhe for the investigated wwtp 89 samples were taken during the 1 year survey from june 2020 to july 2021 this period included both the second and third waves of covid 19 infections in germany for each sample two independent replicates were analysed using e and orf assays an average sars cov 2 rna concentration was calculated from the results of the two replicates and the gene copy numbers for e and orf fig 2 displays infection numbers and sars cov 2 rna concentrations sliding average of three over time both data curves show a similar but time delayed trend fig 2 a by shifting the individual diagnostic testing data set forward the correlation coefficient increased to a maximum of 0 89 p 0 001 at 16 days fig 3 and fig s1 and s2 in supplementary information with this time shift case numbers and ddpcr data matched at increasing and decreasing phases of the 2nd and 3rd waves the observed time gain of 16 days for wbe in our study is higher than the values reported in previous studies time shifts in wbe of 2 4 days hillary et al 2021 nemudryi et al 2020 6 8 days peccia et al 2020 7 days medema et al 2020 8 days hamouda et al 2021 wurtzer et al 2020 11 days róka et al 2021 and 10 14 days agrawal et al 2021a have been reported in some studies no correlation could be found due to pcr noise or low case numbers d aoust et al 2021 westhaus et al 2021 these varying findings can be explained with the high number of variables in diagnostic individual testing availability of rapid antigen tests the speed of clinical tests availability workload of labs testing strategy positive testing rate and the speed of reporting these factors might change over time and differ among sars cov 2 waves e g lockdowns or applied testing strategies wastewater monitoring has the advantage that the data for the catchment area can be available with a single measurement within 48 h in summary good correlation of case numbers and sars cov 2 gene copy numbers could be achieved with the detection of the e and orf genes the shapes of the e and orf curves reflect the observed development of covid 19 cases based on the correlation and a methodological detection limit of 2 5 genomic copies per ml sewage by ddpcr the theoretical limit of detection for the wastewater monitoring is approx 20 infections per 100 000 inhabitants the results of another german study indicated that rt qpcr can detect 50 acute infected persons per 100 000 inhabitants in dry weather periods westhaus et al 2021 in our study one genomic copy per ml is equivalent to 7 active cases per 100 000 inhabitants however the case gene copy number factor is hard to compare with literature as parameters often differ e g cumulative cases medema et al 2020 or gene copies per day agrawal et al 2021a furthermore these values are highly specific for a sewer system and depend on numerous boundary conditions such as characteristics of the sewer system therefore sars cov 2 copy number number of infections factors cannot be transferred directly to other catchment areas 3 3 extended evaluation of primer and probe systems the results for the primers probes n1 e orf and rdrp1 exhibited the highest gene copy numbers for n1 and the lowest one for rdrp1 based on these results it could be hypothesised that the sars cov 2 genome degradation might preferably start from the 5 end in general viral rna can be degraded enzymatically via endonucleases 3 to 5 exonucleases and 5 to 3 exonucleases houseley and tollervey 2009 however viruses have developed specific mechanisms to counteract this degradation these include various 5 end modifications as well as processes of mimicking cellular rnas via cap snatching or even direct blocking of receptor proteins thus preventing recognition dickson and wilusz 2011 markiewicz et al 2021 the genome of coronaviruses has a 5 terminal cap structure and a poly a sequence at the 3 end kim et al 2020 to our knowledge information about the specific enzymatic degradation processes of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater is not available yet to test the hypothesis of the preferential 5 end degradation two additional genes located more closely to the 5 end namely nsp3 and nsp9 and an alternative primer for the rdrp gene hereinafter referred to as rdrp2 were investigated with a set of 64 samples fig 4 for this set samples with high medium and low copy numbers were selected high n1 outliers were excluded generally the observed median gene copy numbers differed between 17 5 rdrp1 and 84 6 copies per ml n1 the medians followed the order n1 rdrp2 nsp9 e orf nsp3 rdrp1 the e orf rdrp1 rdrp2 nsp3 and nsp9 primer probe sets showed a good correlation with coefficients up to 1 00 p 0 05 fig s3 in supplementary information all correlation coefficients with the n1 assay were generally lower and ranged from 0 24 rdrp2 to 0 74 orf comparing the slopes of the linear regression nearly all significant correlations except those with rdrp1 ranged from 0 5x to 2 0x n 46 58 p 0 05 generally rdrp1 provided considerably lower values than the other genes 0 23x 0 46x n 50 47 p 0 05 based on this analysis we can conclude the following i due to the high gene copy numbers outliers observed with n1 and the low gene copy numbers using rdrp1 and nsp3 these primer probe sets are not recommended for wastewater surveillance ii e orf rdrp2 and nsp9 worked well for monitoring using ddpcr and provided comparable gene copy numbers average of deviations 14 and iii the hypothesis of the 5 directed degradation of the sars cov 2 genome was rejected the observed effects of deviation between the different pcr assays might be explained with variations in pcr efficiency as well as general primer design or secondary structures of target regions in the viruses primers and probes did not show any mismatches in comparison with the corresponding target sequences e g sars cov 2 reference sequence nc 045512 2 except for the rdrp1 reverse primer with a single nucleotide mismatch in the middle this mismatch could lead to lower copy numbers vogels et al 2020 however single mismatches not in close 3 proximity are not that critical lefever et al 2013 overall we strongly recommend the application of different primers and probes such an approach will assure reliable and robust results and prevent underestimation of results due to newly occurring primer binding site mutations additionally multiple targets will ensure comparability with earlier results in the case a primer has to be exchanged a good example for this is the n3 forward primer published by the cdc with a mutated nucleotide position in about 4 of observed sequences vogels et al 2020 3 4 spread of voc in the model area we also quantified voc of sewage samples in the sewershed of the city of karlsruhe the proportion of n501y to wildtype sequences was compared with publicly available data from the diagnostic tests of infected persons the proportion of the n501y mutation in wastewater follows the same course as the trend seen for infected persons fig 5 the earliest detection of n501y was made in the wastewater sample of december 28 2020 the proportion of n501y gradually increased to 97 on march 11 2021 and then settled at around 86 in december 2020 the state of baden württemberg reported the detection of the alpha variant b 1 1 7 for the first time corresponding to the first detection of n501y in wastewater influent from karlsruhe after the first detections of variants containing the n501y mutation the increase followed a trend that is comparable with the increase of n501y containing variants in patients in baden wuerttemberg analogous to a dutch study heijnen et al 2021 the results of this study show the applicability of rt ddpcr to detect the spread of relevant mutations of sars cov 2 in the population effluent monitoring of mutations by rt ddpcr is a rapid and efficient method to detect the occurrence of voc on a community level and could also be used as an early warning system for sars cov 2 variants in some studies next generation sequencing ngs techniques from the clinical sector have also been used to detect sars cov 2 mutations agrawal et al 2021b crits christoph et al 2021 izquierdo lara et al 2021 however these techniques require deep sequencing and extensive knowledge on bioinformatics supported interpretation of the results to determine the presence of mutations associated with voc heijnen et al 2021 furthermore ngs results are less quantitative than rt ddpcr results and usually cannot be generated in a timely manner this temporal aspect is of particular relevance with regard to an early warning function of wastewater monitoring the advantage of ngs is the generation of comprehensive information on the existing spectrum of mutations in a sample overall rt ddpcr and ngs are complementary methods that provide important information on the distribution of n501y and other relevant mutations at the community level through the analysis of rna extracts from wastewater samples 3 5 oxygen dependent decay of sars cov 2 rna in order to obtain more information on the stability of sars cov 2 rna in sewer systems studies into the effect of oxygen were conducted depending on flow velocity temperature dissolved organic carbon and other boundary conditions the do concentration in the wastewater of the sewer system can vary for this reason the decay of sars cov 2 rna was investigated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at the beginning of the experiment do contents of 2 8 mg l and sars cov 2 rna concentrations between 95 and 112 gene copies per ml were determined fig 6 in the bottles aerated with atmospheric oxygen the do increased up to 8 5 mg l while the concentration of sars cov 2 rna decreased by 1 log10 level within 24 h after 4 days the copy numbers were below the detection limit in the nitrogen treated bottle the do concentration decreased below 0 1 mg l and viral rna decreased by about 0 3 log10 levels 52 within one day subsequently the concentrations of sars cov 2 biomarkers remained stable the different target sequences orf e and rdrp2 nsp3 provided comparable gene copy numbers maximum standard deviation 26 9 gene copies per ml fig s4 overall the results indicate that the do concentration can affect the fate of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater in addition the batch experiments demonstrated similar degradation rates of four genes localised at different positions throughout the sars cov 2 genome and thus also did not indicate any directional degradation of the genome section 3 3 the virus stability studies published so far have mostly used other human or animal pathogenic coronaviruses showing an influence of temperature ph and matrix on the decay of coronaviruses in several water types foladori et al 2020 at room temperature coronaviruses suspended in tap water primary wwtp effluent or untreated and autoclaved wastewater showed 99 9 reduction within 2 5 days ahmed et al 2020b gundy et al 2009 in contrast animal coronaviruses such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and mouse hepatitis virus mhv showed a higher persistence in pasteurized settled sewage at room temperature casanova et al 2009 times for a 99 reduction were 7 days for mhv and 9 days for tgev casanova et al 2009 however oxygen concentration has not been measured in these studies it has been known for a long time that the oxygen concentration can be an important factor influencing virus survival scheuerman et al 1991 have studied the effects of temperature and do on the persistence of enteric viruses in sludge polio 1 coxsackie b3 and echo 1 and rotavirus sa 11 under laboratory conditions the inactivation rates under aerobic conditions were significantly higher than those under anaerobic conditions 0 77 log10 day vss 0 33 log10 day scheuerman et al 1991 also in groundwater studies the presence of oxygen accelerated enteric viruses decay gordon and toze 2003 sidhu and toze 2012 4 conclusions within this study a robust method for the detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater was established this detection methodology is based on peg precipitation followed by automated nucleic acid extraction and the detection of different target genes by rt ddpcr the following findings were obtained comparison of ddpcr results for seven different primer and probe assays showed that e orf rdrp2 and nsp9 were suitable for wastewater monitoring and yielded similar results the n1 rdrp1 and nsp3 assays clearly deviated from the average of the other primer and probe combinations based on these results and the high mutation potential of coronaviruses we recommend the parallel detection of at least two preferably three or more target sequences to increase the robustness of the method comparison of the wastewater monitoring results for the city of karlsruhe with reported covid 19 infection numbers confirmed the potential of wbe for the early detection of trends in the incidence of infection within a catchment area with pcr based wastewater monitoring also the spread of vocs in a catchment area can be monitored making it a fast and cost effective alternative to ngs based approaches sars cov 2 rna in wastewater showed low decay under anaerobic conditions and fast decay under aerobic conditions these findings are relevant for a better understanding of biomarker stability in sewer systems and storage of wastewater samples the data obtained from the wastewater monitoring were made available to the covid 19 task force of the city of karlsruhe and used as an additional tool for pandemic management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16356,in recent months wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been shown to be an important tool for early detection of sars cov 2 circulation in the population in this study a detection methodology for sars cov 2 rna wildtype and variants of concern in wastewater was developed based on the detection of different target genes e and orf1ab by polyethylene glycol peg precipitation and digital droplet pcr this methodology was used to determine the sars cov 2 concentration and the proportion of n501y mutation in raw sewage of the wastewater treatment plant of the city of karlsruhe in south western germany over a period of 1 year june 2020 to july 2021 comparison of sars cov 2 concentrations with reported covid 19 cases in the catchment area showed a significant correlation as the clinical sars cov 2 official case report chain takes time viral rna titre trends appeared more than 12 days earlier than clinical data demonstrating the potential of wastewater based epidemiology as an early warning system parallel pcr analysis using seven primer and probe systems revealed similar gene copy numbers with e orf rdrp2 and nsp9 assays rdpp1 and nsp3 generally resulted in lower copy numbers and in particular for n1 there was low correlation with the other assays the occurrence of the n501y mutation in the wastewater of karlsruhe was consistent with the occurrence of the alpha variant b 1 1 7 in the corresponding individual clinical tests in batch experiments sars cov 2 rna was stable for several days under anaerobic conditions but the copy numbers decreased rapidly in the presence of dissolved oxygen overall this study shows that wastewater based epidemiology is a sensitive and robust approach to detect trends in the spread of sars cov 2 at an early stage contributing

courses of infection occur qi et al 2018 and at low frequency of clinical diagnostic testing lodder and de roda husman 2020 therefore wastewater surveillance can provide an alternative method to

capacity and without a functioning reporting system such as developing countries kitajima et al 2020 in addition wastewater surveillance can help detect variations in circulating strains allowing

sars cov 2 infections have occurred in a community or whether the number of infected people decreases after measures in the affected population have been taken e g lockdown or social distancing recent

wastewater using pcr based methods multiple sets of pcr primers and probes have been published targeting different locations of the genome such as the s n and e gene chu et al 2020 corman et al 2020 us cdc 2020 for diagnostic testing evaluations of primer and probe sets used in sars cov 2 rt qpcr detection assays were already performed vogels et al 2020 while one of these clinical studies showed a high similarity in the analytical sensitivities for the different assays vogels et al 2020 other studies identified primer probe sets that showed higher sensitivity than others jung et al 2020 nalla et al 2020 however there is a lack of data with respect to the reliability of primers probes and genes at different positions of the genome thus hampering the quantitative comparison of results in particular for wastewater surveillance recently predominantly rt qpcr methods have been published however as an alternative to quantitative real time pcr digital droplet pcr ddpcr can be used for wastewater monitoring cervantes avilés et al 2021 which is a quantitative pcr method allowing an absolute quantification of dna or rna by using ddpcr a higher sensitivity can be achieved compared to qpcr since pcr inhibitors and the competition of background dna and target molecules play a negligible role rački et al 2014 the genome of the sars cov 2 virus is subject to a high mutation rate mutations are distributed across the genome and either have no effect on the phenotype silent mutation or can lead to altered infectivity and pathogenicity mercatelli and giorgi 2020 at the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 variants b 1 1 7 alpha b 1 351 beta and p 1 gamma with increased transmission and clinical importance appeared sandoval torrientes et al 2021 these sars cov 2 variants were classified as variants of concern voc all three vocs have the mutation a23063t also named n501y in common which is involved in the receptor binding mechanism and may have clinical impacts makowski et al 2021 for the single base mutation a primer probe set that allows the specific detection of the mutation has been described heijnen et al 2021 korukluoglu et al 2021 the detection of mutations of sars cov 2 in wastewater additionally reveals a more detailed view of the infection process and the local spread of virus strains the sars cov 2 rna is excreted with the feces of infected patients bogler et al 2020 this viral rna reaches the wastewater treatment plant wwtp via the sewer system where composite samples for wastewater monitoring are usually taken from the influent however relatively little is known about the stability of sars cov 2 rna in sewer systems hart and halden 2020 in general stability is strongly influenced by various environmental factors such as temperature ph biological activity or solid content foladori et al 2020 in laboratory experiments significantly higher reductions were determined at higher temperatures ahmed et al 2020b gundy et al 2009 coronaviruses are enveloped viruses and an intact envelope is important for virus pathogenicity mandala et al 2020 overall there are indications that enveloped viruses are less resistant to environmental conditions and inactivation compared to non enveloped viruses such as adeno or noroviruses gundy et al 2009 ye et al 2016 the virus envelope is highly sensitive to chemical and physical conditions e g ph lipid solvents disinfectants mohan et al 2021 scheller et al 2020 in contrast the capsid protein is probably less subjected to lipid solvents temperature and ph changes although so far little information is available on its stability in this context the aims of this study were i to establish a robust wastewater monitoring procedure including the evaluation of different target genes and the use of digital droplet pcr ii to apply the wbe approach in southern germany iii to determine the distribution of sars cov 2 variants and iv to investigate the stability of its genome in wastewater samples this study was designed to contribute to the assessment of the sensitivity and robustness of sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance and therefore to pandemic and post pandemic management 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites sample collection and storage long term monitoring was performed between june 2020 and july 2021 at the wwtp of the city of karlsruhe karlsruhe is the second largest city of the german federal state baden württemberg and located in south western germany the wwtp of karlsruhe has a capacity of 850 000 population equivalents and treats the sewage of about 370 000 people we collected 24 h composite samples from 0 to 12 pm twice a week using a flow proportional auto sampler the collected samples were homogenised using the dispersing and homogenizing tool minibatch d 9 miccra gmbh and transported to the laboratory at 4 c upon arrival the samples were concentrated and analysed according to the method described below in total 89 samples were taken in the study area as duplicates wastewater samples from other sites in southern germany leonberg baden wuerttemberg and berchtesgadener land bavaria were also used for the evaluation of different target genes 802 samples in total table 1 2 2 sample processing 2 2 1 concentration for sample concentration a volume of 45 ml of wastewater sample was centrifuged 30 min 5000 g to settle larger particles the supernatant was than concentrated using peg nacl precipitation as described by wu et al 2020 with slight modifications briefly 10 w v peg 8000 carl roth and 2 25 nacl w v carl roth were added to the sample and mixed the mixture was agitated on a shaking incubator at 120 rpm for 2 h on ice and subsequently samples were centrifuged at 20 000 g for 2 h at 4 c the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 600 μl pcr grade water thermofisher scientific for all samples two independent replicates were analysed recovery of viruses by the peg precipitation was determined using phi6 bacteriophage as a surrogate for enveloped viruses using spiked samples the phi6 recoveries were approx 26 using peg precipitation in the first phase of the study sars cov 2 rna in particle bound and the dissolved portion were processed in parallel for the solid phase the pellet of 45 ml wastewater was resuspended in 600 µl of pcr grade water and nucleic acid extraction was performed according to section 2 2 2 however since the measured sars cov 2 concentration in the solid phase was at least 0 7 log levels lower than in the liquid phase the solid phase was not taken into account for trend analysis 2 2 2 nucleic acid extraction nucleic acids were extracted directly after concentration using the innuprep virus dna rna kit ipc16 analytik jena gmbh as described by the manufacturer protocol for isolation from 600 µl cell free body fluid extracted nucleic acids were eluted in a final volume of 100 µl and analysed immediately or stored at 80 c in case of the four main assays n1 e orf rdrp1 all ddpcr reactions were performed within a week analysis using further primer and probes set were performed later with a maximum storage time of six month parallel to these analyses the e and orf assays were repeated a comparison of the results for e and orf analysed at the two different time points showed variations within the standard deviation of the ddpcr and no degradation of the rna over the storage period 2 2 3 reverse transcription and pcr detection the sars cov 2 specific sequences were quantified using one step reverse transcription rt ddpcr for the pcr analyses seven primers probe sets were compared table 2 all wastewater samples were analysed using two duplex pcr assays with the primers and probe sets 1 4 additional investigations of selected samples for the evaluation of alternative primers and probes set 5 7 and the detection of the n501y mutation and wildtype sets 8 and 9 were carried out all primers and probes were obtained from thermofisher scientific the ddpcr was performed on the qx200 droplet digital pcr system biorad using the one step rt ddpcr advanced kit for probes biorad reactions were set up in a final volume of 20 µl following the manufacturer s instructions using 3 µl of nucleic acid extract the reaction mixture consisted of one step rt ddpcr supermix biorad 20 units µl reverse transcriptase biorad 15 mm dtt biorad 900 nm primer forward and reverse 250 nm probe and rnase free water the mixture was combined with 70 μl droplet generation oil in the droplet generator biorad and the resulting droplets were transferred to a 96 well plate for pcr cycling cycling conditions were as follows 60 min reverse transcription at 42 c 1 cycle 10 min enzyme activation at 95 c 1 cycle 30 s denaturation at 95 c 1 min annealing extension cycle at 55 c 40 cycles 10 min enzyme deactivation at 98 c 1 cycle and a hold step at 4 c until reading on the qx100 droplet reader biorad data analysis was performed with the quantasoft software biorad no template control and a positive control synthetic rna 4blqsars cov 2 rna 4base lab ag were included in each ddpcr assay quantasoft and quantasoft analysis pro biorad were used to manually threshold and export the data the number of accepted droplets was 13 000 on average and similar for all gene targets analyses with a droplet number below 8000 were repeated with an additional tenfold dilution in accordance with the digital miqe guidelines dmiqe group and huggett 2020 due to this procedure more than 8000 droplets could always be generated in the repetition tests for possible inhibition in ddpcr were performed with ten and hundredfold diluted samples in pcr grade water showing no inhibitory effects diluted samples had an average of 5 deviation from the undiluted samples concentrations per reaction were converted to copies per ml of wastewater all detections were performed in the same lab and with the same methods previous reports showed an actual detection limit of 3 copies per reaction for the ddpcr alteri et al 2020 in this case the detection limit also represents the limit of quantification based on the initial volume of wastewater and the volume of rna extract used in our study a detection limit of 2 5 gene copies per ml of wastewater without taking into account the losses during concentration and extraction was calculated 2 3 covid 19 cases in the model area epidemiological data on covid 19 cases in the studied area were retrieved from the daily report on covid 19 infections in the city and districts of karlsruhe https corona karlsruhe de aktuelle fallzahlen which is based on official data of the federal robert koch institute in charge of public health surveillance in addition the association of accredited laboratories in

württemberg 2 4 statistical analysis basic mathematical calculations mean median sliding average regression and p tests were performed in microsoft excel 14 0 7212 5 to compare trends for the results of different gene targets e g n1 and e a linear regression statistic was performed with and without regression models forced through zero 2 5 biomarker stability tests batch experiments were established in 1 l glass bottles using untreated wastewater from the wwtp of karlsruhe the 24 hr composite sample of the previous day 4 l was transported to the laboratory and directly used for the experiment overall six test bottles containing 600 ml of wastewater were set up three bottles with wastewater were purged with ambient air using aquarium pumps and the other three bottles were purged with nitrogen gas for ten minutes and then sealed immediately the bottles were incubated at room temperature samples were taken to determine dissolved oxygen do and ph using a wtw meter 36 020 ids with optical sensor fdo 925 and ph electrode sentrix from xylem analytics after each sampling the wastewater was purged again with ambient air or nitrogen for five minutes the pcr samples 40 ml were processed using the vac man laboratory vacuum manifold promega and the maxwell rsc enviro wastewater tna kit promega 3 results and discussion 3 1 suitability of four different primer and probe systems the ddpcr data for a total of 802 field samples including results for four primer and probe sets targeting n e orf and rdrp genes 2019 ncov n1 e sarbeco hku orf1b nsp14 rdrp sars hereinafter referred to as n1 e orf and rdrp1 were compared fig 1 the coefficient of variation of independent replicates was 26 using n1 94 of the samples gave a positive result for other primer and probe combinations the proportion of positive detections were considerably lower 62 for e 54 for orf and 20 for rdrp1 a similar trend was observed for average gene copy numbers with highest values for n1 and lowest one for rdrp1 median over all values were 27 5 11 8 11 5 and 8 5 gene copies per ml for n1 e orf and rdrp1 respectively in particular for n1 we observed several results much higher than those measured in samples days before and after these peaks did not appear in the e orf and rdrp assays in some cases the n1 values were more than 2 log10 levels higher than the values obtained by the other assays linear regression between the data fig 1 did show low correlation coefficients or no significance p 0 05 for all combinations with the n1 primer probe set the e and orf correlated well with orf giving slightly lower values as compared to e slope 1 24 at r² 0 96 p 0 001 and n 399 both e and orf gave higher slope values of 2 83 and 2 29 compared to rdrp1 indicating a noticeable difference to exclude internal errors for the n1 assay these extreme values were confirmed by additional replicates the copy numbers of the four tested assays differed showing the following order n1 e orf rdrp1 it was hypothesized that the differences in the gene copy numbers may be caused by variations in assay sensitivity or the localization and stability of the target genes on the sars cov 2 genome the second hypothesis was supported by the preliminary observation that the gene copy numbers decreased towards the 5 end indicating a preferential degradation of the sars cov 2 genome from the 5 end this hypothesis was tested with additional primers on the same sample set see section 3 3 for the same primers differences between gene copy numbers or ct values have also been reported previously for example vogels et al 2020 observed similar ct values for n1 e and orf but higher ct values for rdrp1 in clinical samples similar findings with n1 e and rdrp1 have been reported by muenchhoff et al 2020 for stool samples and for e and rdrp1 in wastewater samples bertrand et al 2021 higher copy numbers corresponding to lower ct values for the n1 primers in wastewater have been reported by gerrity et al 2021 in comparison to n2 e and orf by pérez cataluña et al 2021 in comparison to n2 and e by randazzo et al 2020 for n2 and n3 as well as by fernandez cassi et al 2021 and peccia et al 2020 for n2 due to low values using rdrp1 and the high outliers using n1 wbe data reporting in our study was performed using only e and orf similar decisions have been made by gonzalez et al 2020 and westhaus et al 2021 both studies excluded n1 for wastewater monitoring considering the observed effects in our study initial comparison of detection methods and the parallel detection of at least two sars cov 2 specific genes is recommended to assure reliable wbe 3 2 results of the wbe for the city of karlsruhe for the investigated wwtp 89 samples were taken during the 1 year survey from june 2020 to july 2021 this period included both the second and third waves of covid 19 infections in germany for each sample two independent replicates were analysed using e and orf assays an average sars cov 2 rna concentration was calculated from the results of the two replicates and the gene copy numbers for e and orf fig 2 displays infection numbers and sars cov 2 rna concentrations sliding average of three over time both data curves show a similar but time delayed trend fig 2 a by shifting the individual diagnostic testing data set forward the correlation coefficient increased to a maximum of 0 89 p 0 001 at 16 days fig 3 and fig s1 and s2 in supplementary information with this time shift case numbers and ddpcr data matched at increasing and decreasing phases of the 2nd and 3rd waves the observed time gain of 16 days for wbe in our study is higher than the values reported in previous studies time shifts in wbe of 2 4 days hillary et al 2021 nemudryi et al 2020 6 8 days peccia et al 2020 7 days medema et al 2020 8 days hamouda et al 2021 wurtzer et al 2020 11 days róka et al 2021 and 10 14 days agrawal et al 2021a have been reported in some studies no correlation could be found due to pcr noise or low case numbers d aoust et al 2021 westhaus et al 2021 these varying findings can be explained with the high number of variables in diagnostic individual testing availability of rapid antigen tests the speed of clinical tests availability workload of labs testing strategy positive testing rate and the speed of reporting these factors might change over time and differ among sars cov 2 waves e g lockdowns or applied testing strategies wastewater monitoring has the advantage that the data for the catchment area can be available with a single measurement within 48 h in summary good correlation of case numbers and sars cov 2 gene copy numbers could be achieved with the detection of the e and orf genes the shapes of the e and orf curves reflect the observed development of covid 19 cases based on the correlation and a methodological detection limit of 2 5 genomic copies per ml sewage by ddpcr the theoretical limit of detection for the wastewater monitoring is approx 20 infections per 100 000 inhabitants the results of another german study indicated that rt qpcr can detect 50 acute infected persons per 100 000 inhabitants in dry weather periods westhaus et al 2021 in our study one genomic copy per ml is equivalent to 7 active cases per 100 000 inhabitants however the case gene copy number factor is hard to compare with literature as parameters often differ e g cumulative cases medema et al 2020 or gene copies per day agrawal et al 2021a furthermore these values are highly specific for a sewer system and depend on numerous boundary conditions such as characteristics of the sewer system therefore sars cov 2 copy number number of infections factors cannot be transferred directly to other catchment areas 3 3 extended evaluation of primer and probe systems the results for the primers probes n1 e orf and rdrp1 exhibited the highest gene copy numbers for n1 and the lowest one for rdrp1 based on these results it could be hypothesised that the sars cov 2 genome degradation might preferably start from the 5 end in general viral rna can be degraded enzymatically via endonucleases 3 to 5 exonucleases and 5 to 3 exonucleases houseley and tollervey 2009 however viruses have developed specific mechanisms to counteract this degradation these include various 5 end modifications as well as processes of mimicking cellular rnas via cap snatching or even direct blocking of receptor proteins thus preventing recognition dickson and wilusz 2011 markiewicz et al 2021 the genome of coronaviruses has a 5 terminal cap structure and a poly a sequence at the 3 end kim et al 2020 to our knowledge information about the specific enzymatic degradation processes of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater is not available yet to test the hypothesis of the preferential 5 end degradation two additional genes located more closely to the 5 end namely nsp3 and nsp9 and an alternative primer for the rdrp gene hereinafter referred to as rdrp2 were investigated with a set of 64 samples fig 4 for this set samples with high medium and low copy numbers were selected high n1 outliers were excluded generally the observed median gene copy numbers differed between 17 5 rdrp1 and 84 6 copies per ml n1 the medians followed the order n1 rdrp2 nsp9 e orf nsp3 rdrp1 the e orf rdrp1 rdrp2 nsp3 and nsp9 primer probe sets showed a good correlation with coefficients up to 1 00 p 0 05 fig s3 in supplementary information all correlation coefficients with the n1 assay were generally lower and ranged from 0 24 rdrp2 to 0 74 orf comparing the slopes of the linear regression nearly all significant correlations except those with rdrp1 ranged from 0 5x to 2 0x n 46 58 p 0 05 generally rdrp1 provided considerably lower values than the other genes 0 23x 0 46x n 50 47 p 0 05 based on this analysis we can conclude the following i due to the high gene copy numbers outliers observed with n1 and the low gene copy numbers using rdrp1 and nsp3 these primer probe sets are not recommended for wastewater surveillance ii e orf rdrp2 and nsp9 worked well for monitoring using ddpcr and provided comparable gene copy numbers average of deviations 14 and iii the hypothesis of the 5 directed degradation of the sars cov 2 genome was rejected the observed effects of deviation between the different pcr assays might be explained with variations in pcr efficiency as well as general primer design or secondary structures of target regions in the viruses primers and probes did not show any mismatches in comparison with the corresponding target sequences e g sars cov 2 reference sequence nc 045512 2 except for the rdrp1 reverse primer with a single nucleotide mismatch in the middle this mismatch could lead to lower copy numbers vogels et al 2020 however single mismatches not in close 3 proximity are not that critical lefever et al 2013 overall we strongly recommend the application of different primers and probes such an approach will assure reliable and robust results and prevent underestimation of results due to newly occurring primer binding site mutations additionally multiple targets will ensure comparability with earlier results in the case a primer has to be exchanged a good example for this is the n3 forward primer published by the cdc with a mutated nucleotide position in about 4 of observed sequences vogels et al 2020 3 4 spread of voc in the model area we also quantified voc of sewage samples in the sewershed of the city of karlsruhe the proportion of n501y to wildtype sequences was compared with publicly available data from the diagnostic tests of infected persons the proportion of the n501y mutation in wastewater follows the same course as the trend seen for infected persons fig 5 the earliest detection of n501y was made in the wastewater sample of december 28 2020 the proportion of n501y gradually increased to 97 on march 11 2021 and then settled at around 86 in december 2020 the state of baden württemberg reported the detection of the alpha variant b 1 1 7 for the first time corresponding to the first detection of n501y in wastewater influent from karlsruhe after the first detections of variants containing the n501y mutation the increase followed a trend that is comparable with the increase of n501y containing variants in patients in baden wuerttemberg analogous to a dutch study heijnen et al 2021 the results of this study show the applicability of rt ddpcr to detect the spread of relevant mutations of sars cov 2 in the population effluent monitoring of mutations by rt ddpcr is a rapid and efficient method to detect the occurrence of voc on a community level and could also be used as an early warning system for sars cov 2 variants in some studies next generation sequencing ngs techniques from the clinical sector have also been used to detect sars cov 2 mutations agrawal et al 2021b crits christoph et al 2021 izquierdo lara et al 2021 however these techniques require deep sequencing and extensive knowledge on bioinformatics supported interpretation of the results to determine the presence of mutations associated with voc heijnen et al 2021 furthermore ngs results are less quantitative than rt ddpcr results and usually cannot be generated in a timely manner this temporal aspect is of particular relevance with regard to an early warning function of wastewater monitoring the advantage of ngs is the generation of comprehensive information on the existing spectrum of mutations in a sample overall rt ddpcr and ngs are complementary methods that provide important information on the distribution of n501y and other relevant mutations at the community level through the analysis of rna extracts from wastewater samples 3 5 oxygen dependent decay of sars cov 2 rna in order to obtain more information on the stability of sars cov 2 rna in sewer systems studies into the effect of oxygen were conducted depending on flow velocity temperature dissolved organic carbon and other boundary conditions the do concentration in the wastewater of the sewer system can vary for this reason the decay of sars cov 2 rna was investigated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at the beginning of the experiment do contents of 2 8 mg l and sars cov 2 rna concentrations between 95 and 112 gene copies per ml were determined fig 6 in the bottles aerated with atmospheric oxygen the do increased up to 8 5 mg l while the concentration of sars cov 2 rna decreased by 1 log10 level within 24 h after 4 days the copy numbers were below the detection limit in the nitrogen treated bottle the do concentration decreased below 0 1 mg l and viral rna decreased by about 0 3 log10 levels 52 within one day subsequently the concentrations of sars cov 2 biomarkers remained stable the different target sequences orf e and rdrp2 nsp3 provided comparable gene copy numbers maximum standard deviation 26 9 gene copies per ml fig s4 overall the results indicate that the do concentration can affect the fate of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater in addition the batch experiments demonstrated similar degradation rates of four genes localised at different positions throughout the sars cov 2 genome and thus also did not indicate any directional degradation of the genome section 3 3 the virus stability studies published so far have mostly used other human or animal pathogenic coronaviruses showing an influence of temperature ph and matrix on the decay of coronaviruses in several water types foladori et al 2020 at room temperature coronaviruses suspended in tap water primary wwtp effluent or untreated and autoclaved wastewater showed 99 9 reduction within 2 5 days ahmed et al 2020b gundy et al 2009 in contrast animal coronaviruses such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and mouse hepatitis virus mhv showed a higher persistence in pasteurized settled sewage at room temperature casanova et al 2009 times for a 99 reduction were 7 days for mhv and 9 days for tgev casanova et al 2009 however oxygen concentration has not been measured in these studies it has been known for a long time that the oxygen concentration can be an important factor influencing virus survival scheuerman et al 1991 have studied the effects of temperature and do on the persistence of enteric viruses in sludge polio 1 coxsackie b3 and echo 1 and rotavirus sa 11 under laboratory conditions the inactivation rates under aerobic conditions were significantly higher than those under anaerobic conditions 0 77 log10 day vss 0 33 log10 day scheuerman et al 1991 also in groundwater studies the presence of oxygen accelerated enteric viruses decay gordon and toze 2003 sidhu and toze 2012 4 conclusions within this study a robust method for the detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater was established this detection methodology is based on peg precipitation followed by automated nucleic acid extraction and the detection of different target genes by rt ddpcr the following findings were obtained comparison of ddpcr results for seven different primer and probe assays showed that e orf rdrp2 and nsp9 were suitable for wastewater monitoring and yielded similar results the n1 rdrp1 and nsp3 assays clearly deviated from the average of the other primer and probe combinations based on these results and the high mutation potential of coronaviruses we recommend the parallel detection of at least two preferably three or more target sequences to increase the robustness of the method comparison of the wastewater monitoring results for the city of karlsruhe with reported covid 19 infection numbers confirmed the potential of wbe for the early detection of trends in the incidence of infection within a catchment area with pcr based wastewater monitoring also the spread of vocs in a catchment area can be monitored making it a fast and cost effective alternative to ngs based approaches sars cov 2 rna in wastewater showed low decay under anaerobic conditions and fast decay under aerobic conditions these findings are relevant for a better understanding of biomarker stability in sewer systems and storage of wastewater samples the data obtained from the wastewater monitoring

16357,iron is a recognized physiological requirement for microorganisms but for anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria its role extends well beyond that of a nutritional necessity in this study the function of two typical fe iii minerals ferrihydrite and magnetite in anammox processes was evaluated in the absence presence of fe ii by integrated network and metagenomics analyses results showed that fe iii minerals addition increased the activity of cellular processes and pathways associated with granule formation enabling the peak values of particle size to increase by 144 and 115 respectively notably ferrihydrite 5 mm enhanced nitrogen removal by 4 8 and 4 1 respectively in the short term and long term absence of fe ii ferrihydrite also promoted the retention of anammox bacteria affiliated with phylum planctomycetes in the reactor contributing to an 11 higher abundance with ferrihydrite amendment when compared with the control without iron additions in the short term absence of fe ii network based analyses revealed that ferrihydrite facilitated the microbial community to form densely clustered and complex topologies to improve resistance to environmental disturbance i e fe ii deficiency and effectively increased the underlying cooperation and facilitation in the community metagenomic analysis revealed that there was limited promotion of anammox central metabolism by the extra addition of fe iii minerals in the presence of fe ii highlighting the poor utilization of fe iii minerals by anammox bacteria under fe ii sufficiency this study deepens our understanding of the function of fe iii minerals in anammox systems at the community and functional level and provides a fundamental basis for developing fe based anammox enhancement technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox fe mineral molecular ecological network metagenomic analysis 1 introduction iron is an essential element for microbial growth iron plays many roles within the cell including being incorporated into proteins for essential cellular metabolism e g ribonucleotide reductase acting as oxidative stress sensors e g superoxide dismutases and being incorporated as heme or iron sulfur cluster cofactors for various energy generating and regulatory proteins braun and hantke 2011 lau et al 2016 anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is accepted as a promising environmental friendly technology for biological nitrogen removal from wastewater since anammox reaction was discovered in 1996 van de graaf et al 1996 iron has been considered as an indispensable element in the cultivation medium of anammox bacteria anammox bacteria possess iron rich particles inside the anammoxosome and rely heavily on three classes of iron containing cofactors i e heme c iron sulfur cluster and iron nickel protein for their energy metabolism ferousi et al 2017 van niftrik et al 2008 the activities of three key enzymes required for three steps of the anammox reaction nitrite reductase nir nitrite reduction to nitric oxide no hydrazine synthase hzs synthesis of hydrazine from ammonium and no and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh oxidation of hydrazine to n2 van niftrik et al 2008 are all involved in fe ii regulation iron plays an important role in the growth and activity of anammox bacteria with approximately 1 2 orders of magnitude higher iron required by anammox bacteria than by e coli ferousi et al 2017 iron occurs in two main redox states in the environment ferric iron fe iii which is poorly soluble at circumneutral ph and ferrous iron fe ii which is typically more soluble in general salts with high solubility have higher bioavailability than those with low solubility and thus the bioavailability of fe ii is higher than that of fe iii kappler et al 2021 however at circumneutral ph fe ii is prone to oxidation to fe iii because of its strong reducing property therefore fe iii has been selected to enhance anammox performance numerous efforts have been devoted to evaluation of the influence of iron on anammox based processes with a particular focus on nitrogen removal performance shifts in microbial community composition and the regulatory methods chen et al 2014 bi et al 2014 shu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 2021a different iron species showed varied effects on anammox performance table 1 for instance the start up time of an anammox process was shortened from 70 to 50 days with 0 09 mm fe ii bi et al 2014 and fe ii addition 1 5 mg l effectively improved nitrogen removal zhang et al 2018 fe iii was continuously added into anammox systems and was found to improve the nitrogen removal loading rate 94 increase with fe iii at 0 14 mmol l wang et al 2021a as well as the specific anaerobic ammonium oxidation activity saa 5 fold increase with fe iii at 3 68 mg l chen et al 2014 however most existing studies that have applied fe iii in anammox systems were conducted in the presence of fe ii additionally changes in the iron state are scarcely monitored in current studies because of the complexity of the biochemical iron cycle that occurs in anammox bioreactors this situation makes it challenging to elucidate the individual contributions of fe iii and fe ii as well as their mechanisms of action owing to the important physiological role of iron for most microorganisms weber et al 2006 iron changes in biosystems are bound to interfere with microorganisms resulting in iron perturbation handley et al 2015 ševců et al 2009 therefore it is believed that the addition of iron to anammox systems would inevitably alter the interaction and functional profiles of the system s microbial community to date studies have analyzed changes in the diversity and composition of the anammox bacterial community but few have focused on the iron induced changes in the underlying microbial community such as the microbe microbe interactions functional profiles and their response to iron perturbation understanding these changes is important to elucidate the interactions between taxa across communities and construct linkages between the reactor ecosystem and performance this is because the accomplishment of the system level function e g nitrogen removal of anammox bioreactors depends greatly on the cooperation of individual species within the complex network lawson et al 2017 wang et al 2020a at present fe iii minerals are commonly used in environmental remediation because of their numerous advantages including low cost single dosage no excessive iron accumulation and good stability elreedy et al 2019 ferrihydrite as a poorly crystalline fe iii mineral is highly reactive binding with many contaminants and important nutrients macdonald et al 2011 it also has the potential to trigger a novel microbial fe iii reduction coupled to ammonium oxidation feammox table 1 huang et al 2016 yang et al 2012 thus providing an additional nitrogen removal pathway magnetite fe3o4 another typical fe iii mineral is a mixed valent iron oxide and has been widely applied in environmental remediation because of its super paramagnetism high biocompatibility and ability to promote syntrophic metabolism liu et al 2009 on the basis of the excellent properties of ferrihydrite and magnetite these two fe iii minerals hold promise for enhancing anammox performance however their effectiveness and stability have rarely been reported in this study two fe iii minerals ferrihydrite and magnetite were selected to improve the robustness stability of anammox systems in particular molecular ecological networks were constructed to provide novel insights into the biological interactions and keystone species in anammox systems with the application of fe iii minerals the main objectives were as follows i to explore the responses of anammox performance to ferrihydrite and magnetite amendment in the absence presence of fe ii and understand the mechanism of fe iii minerals on the anammox system to further elucidate the potential regulatory mechanisms of the anammox process and ii to examine the bacterial community dynamics species interaction and functional characteristics in the fe iii mineral amended anammox system the findings will deepen our understanding of the function of fe iii minerals in anammox systems on the community and functional level and facilitate the development of iron based anammox regulation technologies 2 material and methods 2 1 synthetic wastewater and reactor operational strategies the synthetic wastewater contained nh4cl nano2 300 mg l mgso4 7h2o 25 mg l cacl2 1 2

and 250 mg l and 60 120 180 240 and 300 mg l respectively table 2 the influent ph was kept in the range of 7 0 7 5 by adding 3 mol l hcl the seed sludge mixed liquor suspended solids 2000 mg l was taken from an anammox biomass enriched in an expanded granular sludge bed reactor which had been stably operated for more than 300 days with a total nitrogen removal rate of 0 86 kg n m3 d three identical sequencing batch reactors were operated for synthetic wastewater treatment with a working volume of 1 l the reactors were operated for 125 days which was divided into three phases based on the iron supplementation pattern table 2 in the initial phase phases i and ii ferrihydrite 5 mmol l fe iii and magnetite 5 mmol l fe iii were added into two reactors defined as rfer and rmag respectively and the other reactor was operated without iron addition defined as rcon in phase iii 5 mg l fe ii edta fe ii was added into each reactor the other operational parameters such as the operational strategy of each cycle were summarized in text s1 2 2 sample collection and analysis during operation of the anammox reactors effluent samples were collected every day and filtered through disposable millipore filters 0 45 μm the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured using ion chromatography thermo scientific dionex ics5000 ca usa on days 0 12 60 and 125 sludge samples 0

acids ha in the extracted extracellular polymeric substances eps were analyzed using the procedures described by wang et al 2020b c pn and ha were measured using a modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin bsa and ha as standards respectively ps were analyzed using the anthrone method with glucose as a standard granule size was determined using a malvern laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern uk the concentrations of fe ii and fe iii were determined using 1 10 phenanthroline method tamura et al 1974 without hydroxylamine hydrochloride only fe ii in samples can react with 1 10 phenanthroline and the total concentration of fe was quantified after adding hydroxylamine hydrochloride the concentration of fe iii was calculated as the difference between the concentrations of total fe and fe ii 2 3 bacterial community composition analysis and molecular ecological network construction total dna of the sludge samples was extracted using the fastdna soil kit mp biomedicals ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions the concentrations of dna were determined with a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop nd 1000 usa the hypervariable v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified by pcr using total dna as template and 338f and 806r as primers herlemann et al 2011 the amplicons were subjected to high throughput sequencing on an illumina miseq platform paired end 250 bp mode shanghai majorbio biotechnology co ltd the pcr parameters consisted of the following steps 2 min hot start protocol at 98 c followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 30 s annealing at 55 c for 30 s extension at 72 c for 30 s and a final extension for 10 min at 72 c the pyrosequencing data were analyzed using a modified method coupling mothur and qiime as previously reported caporaso et al 2010 including all data processing operational taxonomic unit otu classification alpha diversity e g chao1 abundance based coverage estimator ace simpson and shannon indexes and beta diversity analyses bray curtis distances of microbial community composition were calculated based on otu tables the r program http www rproject org was used for statistical analyses and principal coordinate analysis pcoa to clarify the potential intracommunity interactions and better understand the microbial community of the fe iii amended anammox system co occurrence

networks 2 4 metagenomic sequencing and functional analysis metagenomic dna of the seed sludge and the sludge samples in rcon rfer and rmag day 125 were sequenced on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform majorbio biotechnology shanghai the samples were first ultrasonically fragmented to obtain approximately 300 bp insert sizes metagene was used to predict the open reading frames of samples and the predicted open reading frames with a length 100 bp were translated to amino acid sequences noguchi et al 2006 then cd hit software was used to cluster all the predicted genes to form the non redundant

annotations of each sample by comparing the non redundant gene catalogs with the nr e value 1e 5 and kegg databases ogata et al 1999 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of fe iii minerals on nitrogen removal performance of the anammox reactors the anammox reactors were continuously operated for 125 days and were divided into three phases based on the iron addition patterns and the nitrogen removal performance fig 1 in phase i days 1 12 during the short term absence of fe ii the addition of ferrihydrite effectively increased the total nitrogen removal efficiency nre by approximately 4 8 in phase ii days 13 60 during the long term absence of fe ii although the nres of all three reactors decreased below 50 the presence of ferrihydrite facilitated nitrogen removal performance with nre of 4 1 higher than the control in phase iii days 61 125 the addition of 5 mg l fe ii effectively improved the nre by 6 9 11 5 p 0 05 in all three reactors while no significant difference was observed between the groups with and without fe iii mineral addition fe ii and fe iii were not detected in the effluent of the studied anammox bioreactors which may due to the adsorption of sludge and minerals during the initial period without fe ii addition phase i the anammox performance was relatively stable and rfer showed the highest nre and total nitrogen removal rate nrr among all reactors fig 1 specifically the nres were ranked as rfer 81 3 4 1 rcon 76 5 2 5 rmag 75 1 4 7 suggesting that ferrihydrite could effectively promote anammox performance during short term shortage of fe ii in phase ii when fe ii was still absent the influent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n were increased to 100 and 120 mg l respectively in this phase the tn removal of all reactors significantly deteriorated in the first 10 days during which the nre of both rcon and rmag decreased below 50 as the experiment continued nitrogen removal continuously recovered and the mean nrr reached 71 8 3 2 rcon 75 9 1 0 rfer and 71 3 2 8 rmag in the later period of phase ii days 50 60 this phenomenon may be attributed to the microbial adaptation and adjustment to adverse environmental conditions fe ii deficiency collectively the mean nrrs in phase ii were 0 245 0 03 0 259 0 03 and 0 245 0 03 kg n m3 d in rcon rfer and rmag respectively fig 1c which were lower than those in phase i indicating that fe iii minerals could not maintain satisfactory performance of the anammox system during long term fe ii deficiency e g 60 days in this study in phase iii to avoid collapse of the three anammox reactors 5 mg l edta fe ii was added into reactors to recover the anammox performance zhang et al 2019 tang et al 2020 the mean nres were stable for the three reactors after fe ii addition days 61 86 fig 1 with nre values of 74 75 achieved among the three reactors then the influent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n gradually increased to 250 and 300 mg l days 87 125 respectively fig 1a and b when compared with phases i and ii a much higher tn removal was achieved in phase iii for all reactors with mean nres of 82 7 2 6 82 8 2 70 and 82 8 2 50 and mean nrr of 0 722 0 03 0 721 0 04 and 0 722 0 03 kg n m3 d in rcon rfer and rmag respectively fig 1c these results confirmed that the bioavailability of ferrihydrite to anammox bacteria was higher than that of magnetite and the addition of ferrihydrite stabilized anammox system performance in the short term absence of fe ii the result is inconsistent with previous studies on the effect of magnetite on anammox system chen et al 2021 li et al 2018 possibly because the different operational conditions such as the short term or long term operational time the microbial composition of seed sludge and mineral dosage had been adopted in previous studies and present study besides from a long term perspective addition of fe iii minerals was no better than that of edta fe ii in terms of maintaining enhancing the anammox performance although edta chelated fe ii would be rapidly oxidized to fe iii in the studied anammox systems table s1 we doubt that the transportation of extracellular fe iii into cells is the limiting step for iron utilization by anammox bacteria moreover the dissimilatory iron reduction was not directly detected in our study indicating that the biological feammox reaction might be difficult to be induced in an anammox dominant system as the ideal reaction conditions of anammox and feammox differ greatly for example the optimal ph range for the anammox reaction is 7 8 8 0 while it is 3 92 6 21 for the typical feammox reaction huang et al 2016 jetten et al 2009 there are two main pathways for fe iii uptake by bacteria including reductive mediated uptake and siderophore mediated uptake lis et al 2015 because genes encoding for siderophore synthesis have not been detected in the draft genome of anammox species strous et al 2006 van de vossenberg et al 2013 oshiki et al 2015 the reductive mediated uptake of fe iii is the likely pathway of fe iii uptake in anammox bacteria i e fe iii is reduced to fe ii via extracellular reductases before they are taken up by feo mediated systems zhao et al 2014 therefore the extracellular iron reduction capacity determines the bioavailability of fe iii by anammox bacteria but to date little is known about the mechanism of extracellular reduction of fe iii to fe ii in anammox systems in contrast fe ii can diffuse freely into the periplasm through outer membrane porins feoabc system of anammox cells and the gene encoding the iron transporter feob has been detected in candidatus kuenenia strous et al 2006 in phase iii although part of added edta fe ii had been rapidly oxidized to fe iii table s1 continuous fe ii addition stimulated a fraction of fe ii ions to diffuse into the periplasm of anammox cells via the feoabc system contributing to the increased nitrogen removal performance in all three reactors fig 1c in phases i and ii under fe ii deficiency fe iii was required to be reduced to fe ii via extracellular reductases before they are taken up by feo mediated systems of anammox bacteria it is speculated that such extracellular fe iii uptake capacity of anammox bacteria may be limited so the anammox bacteria could not sustain a high activity over the long term fe ii deficiency which led to a decreased nre in phase ii when edta fe ii were not available for a long term fig 1c the extracellular fe iii uptake capacity of anammox bacteria is an important factor determining the function of fe to enhance anammox performance iron addition also induced changes in microbial community structure and interaction of the anammox systems which may regulate anammox performance see sections 3 3 and 3 4 3 2 characteristics of the fe iii mineral amended anammox granules variations in the particle size and eps composition of the anammox sludge were examined for the three reactors fe iii especially fe iii ferrihydrite significantly promoted flocculant aggregation to form anammox granules the anammox sludge in rfer and rmag formed larger and redder granules than those in rcon at the end of phase iii fig 2 a the peak values of particle size in rcon rfer and rmag were 516 1260 and 1110 μm respectively and the proportion of large particles 2 mm increased by 11 and 7 respectively in rfer and rmag when compared with rcon fig 2b eps plays an essential role in the formation of multilevel porous structures on the cell surface for self protection and to promote microbial aggregation han et al 2017 joshi et al 2012 wang et al 2020c in this study there was no obvious difference in the amount of eps among the three reactors fig 2c indicating that the addition of 5 mm l fe iii did not affect the anammox granules morphology in contrast the percentage of pn in the eps was relatively higher for sludges in both rfer 71 3 and rmag 64 8 than that of rcon 53 6 at the end of phase iii the increased pn percentage in the sludge eps for rfer and rmag may have contributed to a high proportion of hydrophobic groups in their eps which then improved the adhesion of hydrophobic bacteria and thereby favored a remarkable aggregation of anammox bacteria wang et al 2020b humic acids which is an important component of the sludge eps wang et al 2018 was decreased by 85 and 52 in rfer and rmag respectively considering the constant influent composition it is hypothesized that the change in the humic acid contents was caused by the variation in the bacterial metabolism in the anammox system frølund et al 1996 3 3 succession dynamics of the bacterial community in fe mineral amended anammox systems illumina sequencing was performed to explore the succession dynamics of the bacterial community at each operation phase among the three reactors detailed information on the sequenced reads is shown in table s2 and the diversity of bacterial communities was presented in fig 3 a and b significant differences were observed in α indices including ace chao1 shannon and simpson across the three anammox reactors rcon rfer and rmag in phase i when compared with those in phases ii and iii fig 3a pcoa analysis based on bray curtis distance further revealed that the difference in microbial community structure was more distinct among the three anammox reactors in phase i than that in phases ii and iii fig 3b these results suggest that fe iii amendment led to a remarkable succession and differentiation of the bacterial community in the short term absence of fe ii e g in phase i changes in the microbial community further caused a significant difference in the anammox performance of the three reactors in phase i section 3 1 3 3 1 succession of community structure at the phylum level for all sludge samples the dominant phyla were chloroflexi proteobacteria and planctomycetes anammox bacteria comprise a distinct phylogenetically deep branching group within the planctomycetes van teeseling et al 2015 the relative abundance of planctomycetes in all three reactors significantly decreased in phase ii 9 in the long term absence of fe ii and increased in phase iii 30 in the presence of fe ii confirming the crucial role of fe ii in regulating planctomycetes growth in phase i rfer had a significantly higher relative abundance of planctomycetes 31 4 than that of rcon 20 6 and rmag 24 6 which may have contributed to its higher nre in the short term absence of fe ii fig 1 in phase ii the relative abundance of planctomycetes decreased to 8 6 6 1 and 4 7 and increased to 22 7 30 7 and 28 1 in rcon rfer and rmag respectively after the resupply of fe ii in phase iii the variations in the relative abundance of planctomycetes were consistent with the anammox performance that decreased in all reactors in phase ii and increased in phase iii fig 1c section 3 1 the relative abundance of planctomycetes in rfer and rmag was higher than that of rcon in phase iii suggesting that fe iii minerals may be beneficial for the recovery of phylum planctomycetes anammox bacteria thus it can be speculated that anammox bacteria can use ferrihydrite and magnetite as exogenous iron sources which was previously confirmed in a candidatus kuenenia dominated system with iron oxyhydroxide feooh amendment strous et al 2006 members of phylum chloroflexi can be important symbiotic organisms with anammox bacteria functioning as the backbone of the anammox granular structure cao et al 2016 wang et al 2020c chloroflexi gradually became dominant in phases i and ii in all anammox reactors in the absence of fe ii after fe ii was added in phase iii the relative abundance of chloroflexi was approximately 9 lower in the fe iii amended groups rfer and rmag than in rcon fig 3c these results indicate that the chloroflexi facilitated granulation may have been reduced after the addition of combined fe iii minerals and fe ii 3 3 2 successional dynamics of functional bacterial communities at the genus level the relative abundance of 20 most abundant genera in anammox reactors during the three phases was expressed as heat map with horizontal scaling fig 4 a collectively the dominant anammox bacteria of sludges shifted from unclassified f brocadiaceae and ca kuenenia to ca jettenia in the absence of fe ii at the end of phase ii after resupply of fe ii phase iii ca jettenia and ca brocadia became the dominant anammox bacteria in rfer and rmag respectively specifically unclassified f brocadiaceae was the dominant anammox bacteria in the seed sludge with relative abundance of 20 2 in phase i its relative abundance increased to 24 2 in rfer but decreased to 8 6 and 16 7 respectively in rmag and rcon indicating that ferrihydrite stimulated the proliferation of unclassified f brocadiaceae under short term fe ii deficiency the relative abundance of unclassified f brocadiaceae accounted for a tiny fraction 1 in all three reactors in phase ii and exhibited a remarkable recovery to 14 only in rmag at the end of phase iii this result shows that fe ii played an essential role in the long term growth of unclassified f brocadiaceae and the addition of ferrihydrite or magnetite could only facilitate its growth in certain conditions ca kuenenia was the second most dominant anammox bacteria in the seed sludge with relative abundance of 15 6 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia continued to decline among all reactors 5 over time and showed a slight upward trend only in rfer 6 4 in phase iii the relative abundance of both ca jettenia and ca brocadia accounted for a tiny fraction 0 01 of the seed sludge but increased to 18 4 in rfer and 8 9 in rmag respectively in phase iii this indicates that unclassified f brocadiaceae and ca kuenenia were heavily dependent on fe ii which in turn reflected their sensitivity and lower resilience to adverse factors that is fe ii deficiency in contrast ca jettenia and ca brocadia may be better at using the fe iii minerals than other anammox bacterial genera and can survive under fe ii deficiency 3 4 roles of fe iii minerals on microbial interactions in an anammox system bacterial interaction is regarded as a driver for the assembly and functioning of microbial communities liu et al 2020 and network analysis is an advanced method to investigate interactions between microorganisms deng et al 2012 therefore molecular ecological networks were constructed for rcon rfer and rmag to identify the potential microbe microbe interactions in fe iii mineral amended anammox systems fig 4b and table s3 the rfer network had more densely clustered and more complex topologies than that of rcon and rmag with a higher average connectivity avgk and clustering coefficient avgcc deng et al 2012 table s3 specifically rfer contained a higher number of otus 39 nodes than that of rcon 35 nodes and rmag 35 nodes fig 4b indicating an increased network size with ferrihydrite amendment the higher network size and greater network complexity contributed to a greater resilience to disturbances for rfer than that of rcon and rmag zhou et al 2010 overall nodes tended to be positively correlated red lines rather than negatively correlated green lines and positive correlations accounted for 60 66 and 57 of the total nodes in rcon rfer and rmag networks respectively fig 4b the high number of positive correlations in the rfer network reflected the strengthened cooperation and facilitation among species in rfer after the addition of ferrihydrite which could be related to direct cell cell interactions e g co aggregation or co colonization or indirect facilitation e g co metabolism or cross feeding deng et al 2016 in the rfer network 11 otus were positively correlated with anammox bacteria which mainly belonged to the genus norank f anaerolineaceae 45 4 in contrast in the rmag network there were more negative correlations which could arise from competition within the microbial community because predation and amensalism were rarely detected in anammox microbial communities lawson et al 2017 ya et al 2021 in an ecological network the hubs and connectors are commonly defined as keystone species because they play disproportionately crucial roles in the maintenance of community stability deng et al 2012 zhou et al 2010 for the rcon network three nodes were identified as connectors pi 0 62 affiliating with genera norank f anaerolineaceae chloroflexi norank o jg30 kf cm45 and norank f opb56 for the rmag network one node affiliating with genus norank f anaerolineaceae was identified as a connector no keystone was identified in the rfer network fig s1 the keystone species were mainly affiliated with phylum chloroflexi and members of genus norank f anaerolineaceae served as a keystone species for multiple networks norank f anaerolineaceae were also positively correlated with anammox bacteria in the rfer network accordingly anaerolineaceae play an important role in maintaining the functional stability of the anammox reactor anaerolineaceae can oxidize organic macromolecules and are always present at relatively high proportions in anammox reactors miao et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 it is speculated that anaerolineaceae survived by using the soluble microbial products or the eps produced by anammox bacteria possibly acting as a scavenger for the autotrophic requirements of anammox bacteria unlike soil and freshwater microbial communities where keystone nodes tend to be low in abundance the putative keystone species were highly abundant in the microbial community of the studied reactors suggesting that high abundance species govern the anammox reactor community yang et al 2017 wang et al 2021c in the rfer network although keystone species were not identified densely clustered complex topologies with high positive correlations were formed which may have contributed to its reduced dependence on certain keystone taxa like chloroflexi the overall co occurrence patterns of microbial communities showed that ferrihydrite addition improved the resistance of the anammox system to environmental disturbance and improved the cooperation and facilitation among bacterial species endowing relatively stable anammox performance in rfer in the absence of fe ii phases i and ii the network based analyses provide a valuable ecological insight into the microbial population interactions beyond species richness and abundance which deepens our understanding of fe iii regulated anammox systems 3 5 metagenomic analysis reveals functional potential in fe iii mineral affected anammox system 3 5 1 the overall functional profiles of the microbial community to identify the functional potential of the fe iii mineral amended microbial community samples from all reactors in phase iii were selected for metagenomic sequencing approximately 50 gb of high quality reads were obtained after reads quality control and a total of 6054 926 unique genes were generated from samples the relative abundance of the kegg pathways associated with metabolism processes significantly decreased in both rfer and rmag p 0 05 when compared with the control group whereas there was a significant increase in relative abundance of cellular processes that control cell size growth proliferation and survival p 0 05 fig 5 a twenty four dominant metabolic pathways were significantly different among rcon rfer and rmag at kegg level 3 fig 5b among the pathways involved in metabolism the abundance of biosynthesis of secondary metabolites fatty acid metabolism peptidoglycan biosynthesis and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways were significantly decreased p 0 05 in rfer and rmag when compared with rcon in contrast for cellular processes the flagellar assembly pathway increased by 36 and 52 in rfer and rmag respectively p 0 01 and the bacterial chemotaxis pathway increased by 26 and 35 in rfer and rmag respectively p 0 01 when compared with rcon flagellar assembly is required for microbial movement and self aggregation and has implications for granule formation yan et al 2020 bacterial chemotaxis is the biasing of movement towards environments that contain higher concentrations of beneficial chemicals or lower concentrations of toxic chemicals wadhams and armitage 2004 which was reported to regulate eps production and could facilitate anammox bacteria to form granules the increasing trend of these two pathways after fe iii mineral additions may have facilitated the enhanced granulation of anammox bacteria that occurred in rfer and rmag section 3 1 fig 2 3 5 2 the variation in genes encoding key enzymes for nitrogen metabolism the functional genes encoding key enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism were identified and classified according to kegg orthology databases genes involved in the anammox pathway nir hzs and hdh dissimilatory nitrate reduction nar nap and nrf and denitrification nar nap and nir were significantly affected by fe iii minerals fig 6 anammox bacteria rely on a specific set of cytochrome c type proteins especially the unique hdh synthetization of hydrazine from ammonium and nitric oxide no and hzs hydrazine dehydrogenase enzymes for their central energy metabolism dietl et al 2015 jetten et al 2009 fe iii minerals addition led to an increase in the relative abundance of the gene encoding hzs and a decrease in the relative abundance of the gene encoding hdh fig 6 specifically the genes hzsa b c showed a significant upward trend in rfer and rmag when compared with rcon with increases of 30 and 49 respectively p 0 01 in contrast the abundance of hdh decreased by 43 and 65 respectively in rfer and rmag p 0 05 fig 6 theoretically adding iron minerals a conductive material can facilitate the electron transfer and increase the bacterial intracellular iron concentration which in turn promote the activities of fe involved enzymes akram et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 in the present study the failure of fe iii minerals to enhance hdh abundance may imply the limited bioavailability of fe iii by anammox bacteria we also speculated that the increase in the abundance of genes hzsa b c in rfer and rmag may have compensated for the decrease in the abundance of hdh ultimately leading to the nitrogen removal performance in rfer and rmag being similar to rcon in phase iii fig 1 the hzs and hdh genes detected were mostly related to ca jettenia fig 5c for example 83 70 and 74 of identified hdh genes were linked to ca jettenia in rcon rfer and rmag respectively indicating the crucial role of ca jettenia in the studied anammox process denitrification involves multiple nitrogen forms that may ultimately produce n2 through a series of gaseous nitrogen oxide products the reactions in this process are carried out by nitrate reductase nitrite reductase no reductase and nitrous oxide n2o reductase kuypers et al 2018 two non homologous nitrite reductases encoded by nirk and nirs are involved in the first step of the anammox reaction that is reduction of no2 to no when compared with rcon the abundance of nirk was lower in rfer and rmag but the abundance of nirs increased by 42 and 18 in rfer and rmag respectively fig 6 nirs is a nitrite reductase containing both c and d1 type hemes and nirk is a copper containing nitrite reductase zheng et al 2020 the highly increased abundance of nirs induced by ferrihydrite and magnetite addition in the anammox system indicated that fe iii minerals may have a positive effect on nirs type denitrifiers which has the potential to enhance denitrification process furthermore the genes associated with nitrate reductase narg narh nara narb were significantly down regulated in rfer and rmag when compared with rcon p 0 05 as with hzs and hdh most genes encoding nitrate reductase narg narh nara narb were also related to ca jettenia fig 5c highlighting the important role of ca jettenia in nitrate reduction that is ca jettenia may greatly contribute to nitrite availability for other anammox bacterial species collectively ca jettenia may have had a higher resistance to iron deficient stress than other anammox species present in this system and ultimately became the dominant anammox species fig 4a indeed ca jettenia were the predominant anammox species under adverse conditions such as low temperature and low nitrogen concentration li et al 2017 wu et al 2018 the addition of fe iii minerals increased the abundance of nirs hzsa b c but decreased the abundance of hdh resulting in a negligible overall effect on anammox performance when combined with the findings of long term fe ii deficiency phase ii and sufficiency tests phase iii it was deduced that anammox bacteria may have limited ability to directly transport extracellular fe iii minerals into cells the mechanism of extracellular reductive mediated fe iii to fe ii by anammox consortia or other microorganisms in anammox systems is still unclear although many bacteria mainly aerobes and fungi are capable of secreting siderophores to form fe iii siderophores which can then be bound to the membrane receptors and transported into the cell the genes responsible for siderophore synthesis have not been detected in anammox bacteria ferousi et al 2017 therefore it is recommended that addition of fe iii siderophore complexes that function to bind fe iii and transport it into the cell or maintenance of the fe ii valency by addition of appropriate amounts of reduced materials such as zero iron could be suitable strategies to improve the bioavailability of fe iii for anammox bacteria our findings showed that the limitations occurred in the iron acquisition capability of microorganisms in anammox system which highlights that the iron properties e g structure morphology crystallinity and valency should be considered not just in anammox systems but in all biological wastewater treatment processes 4 conclusions in this study fe iii minerals ferrihydrite and magnetite were added into anammox systems and the iron induced structure and functional interaction of the microbial community were systematically studied using integrated network and metagenomic analysis fe iii mineral additions increased the cellular processes and pathways associated with granule formation in the anammox system greatly increasing the peak values of particle size significantly ferrihydrite addition increased nitrogen removal of the anammox system by 4 8 and 4 1 respectively in the short term and long term absence of fe ii and promoted the retention of anammox bacteria affiliated phylum planctomycetes under fe ii deficiency ferrihydrite amendment facilitated the microbial community to form more densely clustered and complex topologies which contributed to the improved stability of anammox systems however limited promotion of anammox central metabolism was evident from the addition of fe iii minerals in the presence of fe ii possibly because of the limited fe iii utilization capacity of microorganisms with sufficient fe ii to our knowledge this is the first report to describe the co occurrence networks and functional profiles of microbial communities in a fe iii amended anammox system in the future methods to improve fe iii bioavailability are urgently needed to further enhance anammox metabolic activity one possible solution is the addition of fe iii siderophore complexes which will improve the bioavailability of fe iii for these iron rich bacteria supporting information fig s1

16357,iron is a recognized physiological requirement for microorganisms but for anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria its role extends well beyond that of a nutritional necessity in this study the function of two typical fe iii minerals ferrihydrite and magnetite in anammox processes was evaluated in the absence presence of fe ii by integrated network and metagenomics analyses results showed that fe iii minerals addition increased the activity of cellular processes and pathways associated with granule formation enabling the peak values of particle size to increase by 144 and 115 respectively notably ferrihydrite 5 mm enhanced nitrogen removal by 4 8 and 4 1 respectively in the short term and long term absence of fe ii ferrihydrite also promoted the retention of anammox bacteria affiliated with phylum planctomycetes in the reactor contributing to an 11 higher abundance with ferrihydrite amendment when compared with the control without iron additions in the short term absence of fe ii network based analyses revealed that ferrihydrite facilitated the microbial community to form densely clustered and complex topologies to improve resistance to environmental disturbance i e fe ii deficiency and effectively increased the underlying cooperation and facilitation in the community metagenomic analysis revealed that there was limited promotion of anammox central metabolism by the extra addition of fe iii minerals in the presence of fe ii highlighting the poor utilization of fe iii minerals by anammox bacteria under fe ii sufficiency this study deepens our understanding of the function of fe iii minerals in anammox systems at the community and functional level and provides a fundamental basis for developing fe based anammox enhancement technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox fe mineral molecular ecological network metagenomic analysis 1 introduction iron is an essential element for microbial growth iron plays many roles within the cell including being incorporated into proteins for essential cellular metabolism e g ribonucleotide reductase acting as oxidative stress sensors e g superoxide dismutases and being incorporated as heme or iron sulfur cluster cofactors for various energy generating and regulatory proteins braun and hantke 2011 lau et al 2016 anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is accepted as a promising environmental friendly technology for biological nitrogen removal from wastewater since anammox reaction was discovered in 1996 van de graaf et al 1996 iron has been considered as an indispensable element in the cultivation medium of anammox bacteria anammox bacteria possess iron rich particles inside the anammoxosome and rely heavily on three classes of iron containing cofactors i e heme c iron sulfur cluster and iron nickel protein for their energy metabolism ferousi et al 2017 van niftrik et al 2008 the activities of three key enzymes required for three steps of the anammox reaction nitrite reductase nir nitrite reduction to nitric oxide no hydrazine synthase hzs synthesis of hydrazine from ammonium and no and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh oxidation of hydrazine to n2 van niftrik et al 2008 are all involved in fe ii regulation iron plays an important role in the growth and activity of anammox bacteria with approximately 1 2 orders of magnitude higher iron required by anammox bacteria than by e coli ferousi et al 2017 iron occurs in two main redox states in the environment ferric iron fe iii which is poorly soluble at circumneutral ph and ferrous iron fe ii which is typically more soluble in general salts with high solubility have higher bioavailability than those with low solubility and thus the bioavailability of fe ii is higher than that of fe iii kappler et al 2021 however at circumneutral ph fe ii is prone to oxidation to fe iii because of its strong reducing property therefore fe iii has been selected to enhance anammox performance numerous efforts have been devoted to evaluation of the influence of iron on anammox based processes with a particular focus on nitrogen removal performance shifts in microbial community composition and the regulatory methods chen et al 2014 bi et al 2014 shu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 2021a different iron species showed varied effects on anammox performance table 1 for instance the start up time of an anammox process was shortened from 70 to 50 days with 0 09 mm fe ii bi et al 2014 and fe ii addition 1 5 mg l effectively improved nitrogen removal zhang et al 2018 fe iii was continuously added into anammox systems and was found to improve the nitrogen removal loading rate 94 increase with fe iii at 0 14 mmol l wang et al 2021a as well as the specific anaerobic ammonium oxidation activity saa 5 fold increase with fe iii at 3 68 mg l chen et al 2014 however most existing studies that have applied fe iii in anammox systems were conducted in the presence of fe ii additionally changes in the iron state are scarcely monitored in current studies because of the complexity of the biochemical iron cycle that occurs in anammox bioreactors this situation makes it challenging to elucidate the individual contributions of fe iii and fe ii as well as their mechanisms of action owing to the important physiological role of iron for most microorganisms weber et al 2006 iron changes in biosystems are bound to interfere with microorganisms resulting in iron perturbation handley et al 2015 ševců et al 2009 therefore it is believed that the addition of iron to anammox systems would inevitably alter the interaction and functional profiles of the system s microbial community to date studies have analyzed changes in the diversity and composition of the anammox bacterial community but few have focused on the iron induced changes in the underlying microbial community such as the microbe microbe interactions functional profiles and their response to iron perturbation understanding these changes is important to elucidate the interactions between taxa across communities and construct linkages between the reactor ecosystem and performance this is because the accomplishment of the system level function e g nitrogen removal of anammox bioreactors depends greatly on the cooperation of individual species within the complex network lawson et al 2017 wang et al 2020a at present fe iii minerals are commonly used in environmental remediation because of their numerous advantages including low cost single dosage no excessive iron accumulation and good stability elreedy et al 2019 ferrihydrite as a poorly crystalline fe iii mineral is highly reactive binding with many contaminants and important nutrients macdonald et al 2011 it also has the potential to trigger a novel microbial fe iii reduction coupled to ammonium oxidation feammox table 1 huang et al 2016 yang et al 2012 thus providing an additional nitrogen removal pathway magnetite fe3o4 another typical fe iii mineral is a mixed valent iron oxide and has been widely applied in environmental remediation because of its super paramagnetism high biocompatibility and ability to promote syntrophic metabolism liu et al 2009 on the basis of the excellent properties of ferrihydrite and magnetite these two fe iii minerals hold promise for enhancing anammox performance however their effectiveness and stability have rarely been reported in this study two fe iii minerals ferrihydrite and magnetite were selected to improve the robustness stability of anammox systems in particular molecular ecological networks were constructed to provide novel insights into the biological interactions and keystone species in anammox systems with the application of fe iii minerals the main objectives were as follows i to explore the responses of anammox performance to ferrihydrite and magnetite amendment in the absence presence of fe ii and understand the mechanism of fe iii minerals on the anammox system to further elucidate the potential regulatory mechanisms of the anammox process and ii to examine the bacterial community dynamics species interaction and functional characteristics in the fe iii mineral amended anammox system the findings will deepen our understanding of the function of fe iii minerals in anammox systems on the community and functional level and facilitate the development of iron based anammox regulation technologies 2 material and methods 2 1 synthetic wastewater and reactor operational strategies the synthetic wastewater contained nh4cl nano2 300 mg l mgso4 7h2o 25 mg l cacl2 1 2

taken from an anammox biomass enriched in an expanded granular sludge bed reactor which had been stably operated for more than 300 days with a total nitrogen removal rate of 0 86 kg n m3 d three identical sequencing batch reactors were operated for synthetic wastewater treatment with a working volume of 1 l the reactors were operated for 125 days which was divided into three phases based on the iron supplementation pattern table 2 in the initial phase phases i and ii ferrihydrite 5 mmol l fe iii and magnetite 5 mmol l fe iii were added into two reactors defined as rfer and rmag respectively and the other reactor was operated without iron addition defined as rcon in phase iii 5 mg l fe ii edta fe ii was added into each reactor the other operational parameters such as the operational strategy of each cycle were summarized in text s1 2 2 sample collection and analysis during operation of the anammox reactors effluent samples were collected every day and filtered through

mastersizer 3000 malvern uk the concentrations of fe ii and fe iii were determined using 1 10 phenanthroline method tamura et al 1974 without hydroxylamine hydrochloride only fe ii in samples can react with 1 10 phenanthroline and the total concentration of fe was quantified after adding hydroxylamine hydrochloride the concentration of fe iii was calculated as the difference between the concentrations of total fe and fe ii 2 3 bacterial community composition analysis and molecular ecological network construction total dna of the sludge samples was extracted using the fastdna soil kit

annotations of each sample by comparing the non redundant gene catalogs with the nr e value 1e 5 and kegg databases ogata et al 1999 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of fe iii minerals on nitrogen removal performance of the anammox reactors the anammox reactors were continuously operated for 125 days and were divided into three phases based on the iron addition patterns and the nitrogen removal performance fig 1 in phase i days 1 12 during the short term absence of fe ii the addition of ferrihydrite effectively increased the total nitrogen removal efficiency nre by approximately 4 8 in phase ii days 13 60 during the long term absence of fe ii although the nres of all three reactors decreased below 50 the presence of ferrihydrite facilitated nitrogen removal performance with nre of 4 1 higher than the control in phase iii days 61 125 the addition of 5 mg l fe ii effectively improved the nre by 6 9 11 5 p 0 05 in all three reactors while no significant difference was observed between the groups with and without fe iii mineral addition fe ii and fe iii were not detected in the effluent of the studied anammox bioreactors which may due to the adsorption of sludge and minerals during the initial period without fe ii addition phase i the anammox performance was relatively stable and rfer showed the highest nre and total nitrogen removal rate nrr among all reactors fig 1 specifically the nres were ranked as rfer 81 3 4 1 rcon 76 5 2 5 rmag 75 1 4 7 suggesting that ferrihydrite could effectively promote anammox performance during short term shortage of fe ii in phase ii when fe ii was still absent the influent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n were increased to 100 and 120 mg l respectively in this phase the tn removal of all reactors significantly deteriorated in the first 10 days during which the nre of both rcon and rmag decreased below 50 as the experiment continued nitrogen removal continuously recovered and the mean nrr reached 71 8 3 2 rcon 75 9 1 0 rfer and 71 3 2 8 rmag in the later period of phase ii days 50 60 this phenomenon may be attributed to the microbial adaptation and adjustment to adverse environmental conditions fe ii deficiency collectively the mean nrrs in phase ii were 0 245 0 03 0 259 0 03 and 0 245 0 03 kg n m3 d in rcon rfer and rmag respectively fig 1c which were lower than those in phase i indicating that fe iii minerals could not maintain satisfactory performance of the anammox system during long term fe ii deficiency e g 60 days in this study in phase iii to avoid collapse of the three anammox reactors 5 mg l edta fe ii was added into reactors to recover the anammox performance zhang et al 2019 tang et al 2020 the mean nres were stable for the three reactors after fe ii addition days 61 86 fig 1 with nre values of 74 75 achieved among the three reactors then the influent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n gradually increased to 250 and 300 mg l days 87 125 respectively fig 1a and b when compared with phases i and ii a much higher tn removal was achieved in phase iii for all reactors with mean nres of 82 7 2 6 82 8 2 70 and 82 8 2 50 and mean nrr of 0 722 0 03 0 721 0 04 and 0 722 0 03 kg n m3 d in rcon rfer and rmag respectively fig 1c these results confirmed that the bioavailability of ferrihydrite to anammox bacteria was higher than that of magnetite and the addition of ferrihydrite stabilized anammox system performance in the short term absence of fe ii the result is inconsistent with previous studies on the effect of magnetite on anammox system chen et al 2021 li et al 2018 possibly because the different operational conditions such as the short term or long term operational time the microbial composition of seed sludge and mineral dosage had been adopted in previous studies and present study besides from a long term perspective addition of fe iii minerals was no better than that of edta fe ii in terms of maintaining enhancing the anammox performance although edta chelated fe ii would be rapidly oxidized to fe iii in the studied anammox systems table s1 we doubt that the transportation of extracellular fe iii into cells is the limiting step for iron utilization by anammox bacteria moreover the dissimilatory iron reduction was not directly detected in our study indicating that the biological feammox reaction might be difficult to be induced in an anammox dominant system as the ideal reaction conditions of anammox and feammox differ greatly for example the optimal ph range for the anammox reaction is 7 8 8 0 while it is 3 92 6 21 for the typical feammox reaction huang et al 2016 jetten et al 2009 there are two main pathways for fe iii uptake by bacteria including reductive mediated uptake and siderophore mediated uptake lis et al 2015 because genes encoding for siderophore synthesis have not been detected in the draft genome of anammox species strous et al 2006 van de vossenberg et al 2013 oshiki et al 2015 the reductive mediated uptake of fe iii is the likely pathway of fe iii uptake in anammox bacteria i e fe iii is reduced to fe ii via extracellular reductases before they are taken up by feo mediated systems zhao et al 2014 therefore the extracellular iron reduction capacity determines the bioavailability of fe iii by anammox bacteria but to date little is known about the mechanism of extracellular reduction of fe iii to fe ii in anammox systems in contrast fe ii can diffuse freely into the periplasm through outer membrane porins feoabc system of anammox cells and the gene encoding the iron transporter feob has been detected in candidatus kuenenia strous et al 2006 in phase iii although part of added edta fe ii had been rapidly oxidized to fe iii table s1 continuous fe ii addition stimulated a fraction of fe ii ions to diffuse into the periplasm of anammox cells via the feoabc system contributing to the increased nitrogen removal performance in all three reactors fig 1c in phases i and ii under fe ii deficiency fe iii was required to be reduced to fe ii via extracellular reductases before they are taken up by feo mediated systems of anammox bacteria it is speculated that such extracellular fe iii uptake capacity of anammox bacteria may be limited so the anammox bacteria could not sustain a high activity over the long term fe ii deficiency which led to a decreased nre in phase ii when edta fe ii were not available for a long term fig 1c the extracellular fe iii uptake capacity of anammox bacteria is an important factor determining the function of fe to enhance anammox performance iron addition also induced changes in microbial community structure and interaction of the anammox systems which may regulate anammox performance see sections 3 3 and 3 4 3 2 characteristics of the fe iii mineral amended anammox granules variations in the particle size and eps composition of the anammox sludge were examined for the three reactors fe iii especially fe iii ferrihydrite significantly promoted flocculant aggregation to form anammox granules the anammox sludge in rfer and rmag formed larger and redder granules than those in rcon at the end of phase iii fig 2 a the peak values of particle size in rcon rfer and rmag were 516 1260 and 1110 μm respectively and the proportion of large particles 2 mm increased by 11 and 7 respectively in rfer and rmag when compared with rcon fig 2b eps plays an essential role in the formation of multilevel porous structures on the cell surface for self protection and to promote microbial aggregation han et al 2017 joshi et al 2012 wang et al 2020c in this study there was no obvious difference in the amount of eps among the three reactors fig 2c indicating that the addition of 5 mm l fe iii did not affect the anammox granules morphology in contrast the percentage of pn in the eps was relatively higher for sludges in both rfer 71 3 and rmag 64 8 than that of rcon 53 6 at the end of phase iii the increased pn percentage in the sludge eps for rfer and rmag may have contributed to a high proportion of hydrophobic groups in their eps which then improved the adhesion of hydrophobic bacteria and thereby favored a remarkable aggregation of anammox bacteria wang et al 2020b humic acids which is an important component of the sludge eps wang et al 2018 was decreased by 85 and 52 in rfer and rmag respectively considering the constant influent composition it is hypothesized that the change in the humic acid contents was caused by the variation in the bacterial metabolism in the anammox system frølund et al 1996 3 3 succession dynamics of the bacterial community in fe mineral amended anammox systems illumina sequencing was performed to explore the succession dynamics of the bacterial community at each operation phase among the three reactors detailed information on the sequenced reads is shown in table s2 and the diversity of bacterial communities was presented in fig 3 a and b significant differences were observed in α indices including ace chao1 shannon and simpson across the three anammox reactors rcon rfer and rmag in phase i when compared with those in phases ii and iii fig 3a pcoa analysis based on bray curtis distance further revealed that the difference in microbial community structure was more distinct among the three anammox reactors in phase i than that in phases ii and iii fig 3b these results suggest that fe iii amendment led to a remarkable succession and differentiation of the bacterial community in the short term absence of fe ii e g in phase i changes in the microbial community further caused a significant difference in the anammox performance of the three reactors in phase i section 3 1 3 3 1 succession of community structure at the phylum level for all sludge samples the dominant phyla were chloroflexi proteobacteria and planctomycetes anammox bacteria comprise a distinct phylogenetically deep branching group within the planctomycetes van teeseling et al 2015 the relative abundance of planctomycetes in all three reactors significantly decreased in phase ii 9 in the long term absence of fe ii and increased in phase iii 30 in the presence of fe ii confirming the crucial role of fe ii in regulating planctomycetes growth in phase i rfer had a significantly higher relative abundance of planctomycetes 31 4 than that of rcon 20 6 and rmag 24 6 which may have contributed to its higher nre in the short term absence of fe ii fig 1 in phase ii the relative abundance of planctomycetes decreased to 8 6 6 1 and 4 7 and increased to 22 7 30 7 and 28 1 in rcon rfer and rmag respectively after the resupply of fe ii in phase iii the variations in the relative abundance of planctomycetes were consistent with the anammox performance that decreased in all reactors in phase ii and increased in phase iii fig 1c section 3 1 the relative abundance of planctomycetes in rfer and rmag was higher than that of rcon in phase iii suggesting that fe iii minerals may be beneficial for the recovery of phylum planctomycetes anammox bacteria thus it can be speculated that anammox bacteria can use ferrihydrite and magnetite as exogenous iron sources which was previously confirmed in a candidatus kuenenia dominated system with iron oxyhydroxide feooh amendment strous et al 2006 members of phylum chloroflexi can be important symbiotic organisms with anammox bacteria functioning as the backbone of the anammox granular structure cao et al 2016 wang et al 2020c chloroflexi gradually became dominant in phases i and ii in all anammox reactors in the absence of fe ii after fe ii was added in phase iii the relative abundance of chloroflexi was approximately 9 lower in the fe iii amended groups rfer and rmag than in rcon fig 3c these results indicate that the chloroflexi facilitated granulation may have been reduced after the addition of combined fe iii minerals and fe ii 3 3 2 successional dynamics of functional bacterial communities at the genus level the relative abundance of 20 most abundant genera in anammox reactors during the three phases was expressed as heat map with horizontal scaling fig 4 a collectively the dominant anammox bacteria of sludges shifted from unclassified f brocadiaceae and ca kuenenia to ca jettenia in the absence of fe ii at the end of phase ii after resupply of fe ii phase iii ca jettenia and ca brocadia became the dominant anammox bacteria in rfer and rmag respectively specifically unclassified f brocadiaceae was the dominant anammox bacteria in the seed sludge with relative abundance of 20 2 in phase i its relative abundance increased to 24 2 in rfer but decreased to 8 6 and 16 7 respectively in rmag and rcon indicating that ferrihydrite stimulated the proliferation of unclassified f brocadiaceae under short term fe ii deficiency the relative abundance of unclassified f brocadiaceae accounted for a tiny fraction 1 in all three reactors in phase ii and exhibited a remarkable recovery to 14 only in rmag at the end of phase iii this result shows that fe ii played an essential role in the long term growth of unclassified f brocadiaceae and the addition of ferrihydrite or magnetite could only facilitate its growth in certain conditions ca kuenenia was the second most dominant anammox bacteria in the seed sludge with relative abundance of 15 6 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia continued to decline among all reactors 5 over time and showed a slight upward trend only in rfer 6 4 in phase iii the relative abundance of both ca jettenia and ca brocadia accounted for a tiny fraction 0 01 of the seed sludge but increased to 18 4 in rfer and 8 9 in rmag respectively in phase iii this indicates that unclassified f brocadiaceae and ca kuenenia were heavily dependent on fe ii which in turn reflected their sensitivity and lower resilience to adverse factors that is fe ii deficiency in contrast ca jettenia and ca brocadia may be better at using the fe iii minerals than other anammox bacterial genera and can survive under fe ii deficiency 3 4 roles of fe iii minerals on microbial interactions in an anammox system bacterial interaction is regarded as a driver for the assembly and functioning of microbial communities liu et al 2020 and network analysis is an advanced method to investigate interactions between microorganisms deng et al 2012 therefore molecular ecological networks were constructed for rcon rfer and rmag to identify the potential microbe microbe interactions in fe iii mineral amended anammox systems fig 4b and table s3 the rfer network had more densely clustered and more complex topologies than that of rcon and rmag with a higher average connectivity avgk and clustering coefficient avgcc deng et al 2012 table s3 specifically rfer contained a higher number of otus 39 nodes than that of rcon 35 nodes and rmag 35 nodes fig 4b indicating an increased network size with ferrihydrite amendment the higher network size and greater network complexity contributed to a greater resilience to disturbances for rfer than that of rcon and rmag zhou et al 2010 overall nodes tended to be positively correlated red lines rather than negatively correlated green lines and positive correlations accounted for 60 66 and 57 of the total nodes in rcon rfer and rmag networks respectively fig 4b the high number of positive correlations in the rfer network reflected the strengthened cooperation and facilitation among species in rfer after the addition of ferrihydrite which could be related to direct cell cell interactions e g co aggregation or co colonization or indirect facilitation e g co metabolism or cross feeding deng et al 2016 in the rfer network 11 otus were positively correlated with anammox bacteria which mainly belonged to the genus norank f anaerolineaceae 45 4 in contrast in the rmag network there were more negative correlations which could arise from competition within the microbial community because predation and amensalism were rarely detected in anammox microbial communities lawson et al 2017 ya et al 2021 in an ecological network the hubs and connectors are commonly defined as keystone species because they play disproportionately crucial roles in the maintenance of community stability deng et al 2012 zhou et al 2010 for the rcon network three nodes were identified as connectors pi 0 62 affiliating with genera norank f anaerolineaceae chloroflexi norank o jg30 kf cm45 and norank f opb56 for the rmag network one node affiliating with genus norank f anaerolineaceae was identified as a connector no keystone was identified in the rfer network fig s1 the keystone species were mainly affiliated with phylum chloroflexi and members of genus norank f anaerolineaceae served as a keystone species for multiple networks norank f anaerolineaceae were also positively correlated with anammox bacteria in the rfer network accordingly anaerolineaceae play an important role in maintaining the functional stability of the anammox reactor anaerolineaceae can oxidize organic macromolecules and are always present at relatively high proportions in anammox reactors miao et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 it is speculated that anaerolineaceae survived by using the soluble microbial products or the eps produced by anammox bacteria possibly acting as a scavenger for the autotrophic requirements of anammox bacteria unlike soil and freshwater microbial communities where keystone nodes tend to be low in abundance the putative keystone species were highly abundant in the microbial community of the studied reactors suggesting that high abundance species govern the anammox reactor community yang et al 2017 wang et al 2021c in the rfer network although keystone species were not identified densely clustered complex topologies with high positive correlations were formed which may have contributed to its reduced dependence on certain keystone taxa like chloroflexi the overall co occurrence patterns of microbial communities showed that ferrihydrite addition improved the resistance of the anammox system to environmental disturbance and improved the cooperation and facilitation among bacterial species endowing relatively stable anammox performance in rfer in the absence of fe ii phases i and ii the network based analyses provide a valuable ecological insight into the microbial population interactions beyond species richness and abundance which deepens our understanding of fe iii regulated anammox systems 3 5 metagenomic analysis reveals functional potential in fe iii mineral affected anammox system 3 5 1 the overall functional profiles of the microbial community to identify the functional potential of the fe iii mineral amended microbial community samples from all reactors in phase iii were selected for metagenomic sequencing approximately 50 gb of high quality reads were obtained after reads quality control and a total of 6054 926 unique genes were generated from samples the relative abundance of the kegg pathways associated with metabolism processes significantly decreased in both rfer and rmag p 0 05 when compared with the control group whereas there was a significant increase in relative abundance of cellular processes that control cell size growth proliferation and survival p 0 05 fig 5 a twenty four dominant metabolic pathways were significantly different among rcon rfer and rmag at kegg level 3 fig 5b among the pathways involved in metabolism the abundance of biosynthesis of secondary metabolites fatty acid metabolism peptidoglycan biosynthesis and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways were significantly decreased p 0 05 in rfer and rmag when compared with rcon in contrast for cellular processes the flagellar assembly pathway increased by 36 and 52 in rfer and rmag respectively p 0 01 and the bacterial chemotaxis pathway increased by 26 and 35 in rfer and rmag respectively p 0 01 when compared with rcon flagellar assembly is required for microbial movement and self aggregation and has implications for granule formation yan et al 2020 bacterial chemotaxis is the biasing of movement towards environments that contain higher concentrations of beneficial chemicals or lower concentrations of toxic chemicals wadhams and armitage 2004 which was reported to regulate eps production and could facilitate anammox bacteria to form granules the increasing trend of these two pathways after fe iii mineral additions may have facilitated the enhanced granulation of anammox bacteria that occurred in rfer and rmag section 3 1 fig 2 3 5 2 the variation in genes encoding key enzymes for nitrogen metabolism the functional genes encoding key enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism were identified and classified according to kegg orthology databases genes involved in the anammox pathway nir hzs and hdh dissimilatory nitrate reduction nar nap and nrf and denitrification nar nap and nir were significantly affected by fe iii minerals fig 6 anammox bacteria rely on a specific set of cytochrome c type proteins especially the unique hdh synthetization of hydrazine from ammonium and nitric oxide no and hzs hydrazine dehydrogenase enzymes for their central energy metabolism dietl et al 2015 jetten et al 2009 fe iii minerals addition led to an increase in the relative abundance of the gene encoding hzs and a decrease in the relative abundance of the gene encoding hdh fig 6 specifically the genes hzsa b c showed a significant upward trend in rfer and rmag when compared with rcon with increases of 30 and 49 respectively p 0 01 in contrast the abundance of hdh decreased by 43 and 65 respectively in rfer and rmag p 0 05 fig 6 theoretically adding iron minerals a conductive material can facilitate the electron transfer and increase the bacterial intracellular iron concentration which in turn promote the activities of fe involved enzymes akram et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 in the present study the failure of fe iii minerals to enhance hdh abundance may imply the limited bioavailability of fe iii by anammox bacteria we also speculated that the increase in the abundance of genes hzsa b c in rfer and rmag may have compensated for the decrease in the abundance of hdh ultimately leading to the nitrogen removal performance in rfer and rmag being similar to rcon in phase iii fig 1 the hzs and hdh genes detected were mostly related to ca jettenia fig 5c for example 83 70 and 74 of identified hdh genes were linked to ca jettenia in rcon rfer and rmag respectively indicating the crucial role of ca jettenia in the studied anammox process denitrification involves multiple nitrogen forms that may ultimately produce n2 through a series of gaseous nitrogen oxide products the reactions in this process are carried out by nitrate reductase nitrite reductase no reductase and nitrous oxide n2o reductase kuypers et al 2018 two non homologous nitrite reductases encoded by nirk and nirs are involved in the first step of the anammox reaction that is reduction of no2 to no when compared with rcon the abundance of nirk was lower in rfer and rmag but the abundance of nirs increased by 42 and 18 in rfer and rmag respectively fig 6 nirs is a nitrite reductase containing both c and d1 type hemes and nirk is a copper containing nitrite reductase zheng et al 2020 the highly increased abundance of nirs induced by ferrihydrite and magnetite addition in the anammox system indicated that fe iii minerals may have a positive effect on nirs type denitrifiers which has the potential to enhance denitrification process furthermore the genes associated with nitrate reductase narg narh nara narb were significantly down regulated in rfer and rmag when compared with rcon p 0 05 as with hzs and hdh most genes encoding nitrate reductase narg narh nara narb were also related to ca jettenia fig 5c highlighting the important role of ca jettenia in nitrate reduction that is ca jettenia may greatly contribute to nitrite availability for other anammox bacterial species collectively ca jettenia may have had a higher resistance to iron deficient stress than other anammox species present in this system and ultimately became the dominant anammox species fig 4a indeed ca jettenia were the predominant anammox species under adverse conditions such as low temperature and low nitrogen concentration li et al 2017 wu et al 2018 the addition of fe iii minerals increased the abundance of nirs hzsa b c but decreased the abundance of hdh resulting in a negligible overall effect on anammox performance when combined with the findings of long term fe ii deficiency phase ii and sufficiency tests phase iii it was deduced that anammox bacteria may have limited ability to directly transport extracellular fe iii minerals into cells the mechanism of extracellular reductive mediated fe iii to fe ii by anammox consortia or other microorganisms in anammox systems is still unclear although many bacteria mainly aerobes and fungi are capable of secreting siderophores to form fe iii siderophores which can then be bound to the membrane receptors and transported into the cell the genes responsible for siderophore synthesis have not been detected in anammox bacteria ferousi et al 2017 therefore it is recommended that addition of fe iii siderophore complexes that function to bind fe iii and transport it into the cell or maintenance of the fe ii valency by addition of appropriate amounts of reduced materials such as zero iron could be suitable strategies to improve the bioavailability of fe iii for anammox bacteria our findings showed that the limitations occurred in the iron acquisition capability of microorganisms in anammox system which highlights that the iron properties e g structure morphology crystallinity and valency should be considered not just in anammox systems but in all biological wastewater treatment processes 4 conclusions in this study fe iii minerals ferrihydrite and magnetite were added into anammox systems and the iron induced structure and functional interaction of the microbial community were systematically studied using integrated network and metagenomic analysis fe iii mineral additions increased the cellular processes and pathways associated with granule formation in the anammox system greatly increasing the peak values of particle size significantly ferrihydrite addition increased nitrogen removal of the anammox system by 4 8 and 4 1 respectively in the short term and long term absence of fe ii and promoted the retention of anammox bacteria affiliated phylum planctomycetes under fe ii deficiency ferrihydrite amendment facilitated the microbial community to form more densely clustered and complex topologies which contributed to the improved stability of anammox systems however limited promotion of anammox central metabolism was evident from the addition of fe iii minerals in the presence of fe ii possibly because of the limited fe iii utilization capacity of microorganisms with sufficient fe ii to our knowledge this is the first report to describe the co occurrence networks and functional profiles of microbial communities in a fe iii amended anammox system in the future methods to improve fe iii bioavailability are urgently needed to further enhance anammox metabolic activity one possible solution is the addition of fe iii siderophore complexes which will improve the bioavailability of fe iii for these iron rich bacteria supporting information fig s1

16358,real time monitoring of non point source nps pollution is challenging owing to the minute scale change in runoff flow and concentration under rainfall condition in this study we proposed a real time measurement method for total nitrogen tn by combining the timeliness of sensor detection and the accuracy of intelligent algorithms based on the physical and chemical relationships between tn and sensor measured indexes extra tree regression was selected as the tn inversion algorithm which has high precision high computational efficiency and better ability in over fitting control the results show that 1 the real time inversion algorithm of tn can achieve the monitoring frequency at the minute scale 5 min 2 the method performs well r2 0 9 when the training and testing datasets are from similar environmental backgrounds fields or ditches 3 in the case of partial variable missing this method can still realize tn inversion and the prediction accuracy is acceptable r2 0 7 under the number of missing variables n 2 which makes up for the flaws of missing or abnormal data caused by sensor malfunctions overall the proposed real time measurement method of tn has stable data acquisition high precision and high monitoring frequency in addition the method is not limited by cloudy rainy or nighttime conditions compared with methods such as laboratory test remote sensing inversion and water quality automatic monitoring station our method has obvious advantages in runoff monitoring of nps pollution which mainly occurs in small and micro water bodies the new real time

is a severe global threat to the water environment cheng et al 2019 ongley et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 causing water eutrophication or other forms of pollution by picking up pollutants and depositing them into receiving water bodies including rivers lakes and reservoirs by runoff under rainfall or snowmelt conditions usepa 2003 monitoring is the basis for the effective control and supervision of agricultural nps pollution unlike rivers and lakes with relatively stable water quantity and quality the spatiotemporal heterogeneous nature of nps makes it difficult to achieve effective monitoring wang et al 2019 when nps pollution occurs the water quantity and quality of surface runoff change rapidly over a short period especially in the first 30 min of the initial rainfall phase delpla et al 2011 characteristics such as this put forward higher requirements for nps pollution monitoring frequency and effectiveness among the common pollutants total nitrogen tn is an important indicator of eutrophication caused by nps pollution li et al 2021 zhuang et al 2019 in field experiments manual measurement is the conventional monitoring method for surface runoff tn concentration which is mainly processed through laboratory experiments after manual sampling using runoff collection devices runoff collection ponds tanks or buckets such methods are notoriously laborious and time consuming bah et al 2020 chen et al 2017 kang et al 2006 wang et al 2015 recently water quality automatic monitoring station has been increasingly applied to online monitoring chen et al 2016 hillel et al 2015 however the related monitoring frequency is approximately 45 min per sample based on the chemical method which is insufficient to reveal the dynamic change of pollutants in the runoff process within hypo rainfall events as another method water environment remote sensing technology has also been widely used especially in large scale monitoring of surface water quality but such technology is generally limited by the nature of its temporal spatial resolution and susceptibility to influence by weather conditions cloudy or rainy alexakis et al 2019 goetz et al 2008 oki and yasuoka 2008 wang et al 2020a in addition the occurrence and transport of nps pollutants mainly occur in small or micro water bodies such as field outlets ditches and ponds yet both water quality automatic monitoring station and remote sensing inversion are only suitable for large and medium sized water bodies or relatively stable water bodies therefore in general current tn monitoring methods are not suitable for real time monitoring of nps pollution sensor method can carry out rapid and continuous monitoring of water quality dybko et al 1998 mendez barroso et al 2020 wang et al 2020b using this method the most common monitoring indicators include ph electrical conductivity ec oxidation reduction potential orp water temperature t dissolved oxygen do ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and chlorophyll a yet there is a lack of mature sensors that can be directly used for the rapid monitoring of tn concentration on the one hand the chemical and physical correlations between tn and these sensor measured indicators have been proved to be significant kim and furumai 2013 ma et al 2021 on the other hand intelligent algorithms such as decision tree models are a powerful means of modeling data without much prior preparation hammann and drewe 2012 both the chemical and physical correlations and the intelligent algorithms provide possibilities for indirect tn inversion which are an important theoretical basis and technological support respectively given the current insufficient intelligence of nps pollution monitoring technologies and difficulties of high frequency monitoring this study aims to 1 propose a real time measurement method of tn by combining the timeliness of sensor detection and the accuracy of intelligent algorithms and 2 clarify the applicable conditions the sampling environmental backgrounds and the tolerance for missing values of the proposed method 2 methods and data the framework and application scenario of the real time measurement method of tn for runoff are shown in fig 1 in the proposed method real time conventional water quality data were collected by stable multiparameter sensors installed in field outlets and ditches and were transferred to a master computer then all of the monitoring data were merged and transferred to a cloud server where the tn concentrations were predicted based on the intelligent algorithm finally real time tn concentrations were received at the user terminals 2 1 data set and sources the selected study region was a typical paddy irrigation and drainage unit in the yangtze river basin located in anlu city hubei province china fig 2 a at the base fertilizer stage and tillering stage of rice in may july 2018 we set up five field sites 1 5 and one ditch site 6 to monitor the outflow water quality using water quality parameter sensors fig 2b table 1 runoff samples were collected every 10 min in the first hour and every 20 min in the second hour after the runoff generation over the following two hours when water levels stabilized runoff samples were collected once every hour until the end of runoff generation according to the regional runoff characteristics seven variables including ph ec μs cm orp mv t do mg l nh4 n mg l and no3 n mg l were selected as input indicators for tn inversion the tn concentration was tested by the national standard method synchronously ph ec orp t nh4 n and no3 n were acquired using electrochemical sensors and do was acquired using a fluorescence sensor in total 8 variables and 192 groups of data were obtained 2 2 algorithms for tn inversion intelligent algorithm has been proven to be effective and efficient solutions to nonlinear regression problems with a high predictive ability and the advantages of automated statistical modeling processes chen et al 2018 hanoon et al 2021 in this study the tn concentration was predicted by intelligent algorithm given the seven sensor measured variables to obtain the optimal multiparameter fitting seven algorithms were examined to evaluate their predictive ability linear support vector regression svr brereton and lloyd 2010 were et al 2015 yu et al 2006 k nearest neighbors knn goodfellow et al 2016 lee and ouarda

are contained in the scikit learn library based on the python programming language http scikit learn org preliminary assessment and screening of the seven algorithms were conducted based on the tn prediction accuracy their applicability and tolerance to missing values were further tested fig 3 the same training and testing data were used in all algorithms 2 3 applicability analysis considering the impact of environmental backgrounds it can be expected that the models established based on datasets from certain monitoring sites may not perform well at others thus we conducted an applicability analysis with six scenarios scenarios 1 6 to evaluate the impact of training site heterogeneity on the stability and adaptability of the models table 2 the tn inversion accuracy was analyzed and compared based on the monitoring source types of runoff samples field or ditch the scenarios were divided into the following categories training and testing data from all sample sources scenario 1 training and testing data from the same sample sources scenarios 2 and 3 and training and testing data from different sample sources scenarios 4 5 and 6 for scenarios 1 3 with the same data sources the proportion of training data and testing data was 75 and 25 respectively for scenarios 4 6 the training and testing data were composed of all data from the different sample sources 2 4 tolerance test to missing values missing values which are generally common in environmental monitoring data tend to affect the data quality or even the immediate assessment of the water environment however the tolerance to missing values varies among each algorithm which greatly affects the prediction accuracy of tn inversion in this study to test the tolerance of the algorithms to missing values we set n the number of missing input variables and p the proportion of data groups containing missing values to assess the missing condition of monitoring data four levels were set for n 0 1 2 and 3 and p 0 25 50 and 100 respectively considering that the missing condition of the data impacts the statistical analyses the missing values were completely random little 1988 further the mean imputation was used to fill in the missing values with the mean value of training data luengo et al 2010 norazian et al 2008 son and kim 2020 2 5 accuracy assessment the prediction accuracy of the models for tn concentration was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 relative error re mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and accuracy acc which were calculated using the follow equations 1 r 2 1 i 1 n y i f i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 2 r e f i y i y i 100 3 m r e i 1 n r e n 4 r m s e i 1 n f i y i 2 n 5 a c c n a n 100 where yi is the actual value fi is the prediction value y is the actual mean value n is the sample capacity and na is the number of predicted values of re within 20 li et al 2017 moriasi et al 2015 the best possible score for r2 is 1 0 a negative r2 indicated that a model was arbitrarily worse and an r2 score of 0 indicated that a model consistently predicted the expected value of yi disregarding the input features 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal algorithm selection the prediction accuracy of the seven algorithms was summarized for when the proportion of data groups containing missing values was 0 25 50 75 and 100 respectively fig 4 the results showed that etr gbr rfr and dtr all showed a good fit based on all data with no missing values n 0 p 0 with r2 greater than 0 92 acc greater than 70 rmse less than 2 1 mg l and mre less than 16 2 in general ensemble algorithm modules which construct a strong ensemble learner by incorporating several weak learners based on ensemble system approaches bagging boosting or stacking enhance the performance of the model by reducing the over fitting concerns thus resulting in higher prediction reliability farooq et al 2021 the knn method showed the worst prediction with r2 0 47 and rmse 5 5 mg l which can be explained by the discrepancy when determining k the number of nearest neighbors leading to a low accuracy with error or high dimensional data lee and ouarda 2011 further it was required to have an algorithm that could maintain good fitting accuracy when some data were missing therefore the fitting accuracy after randomly removing one variable in each sample n 1 was evaluated with the increase in the proportion of missing value samples p differences in the fitting accuracy emerged the fitting accuracy of the etr decreased more slowly despite the slightly lower fitting accuracy for the overall data compared with gbr when p increased from 25 to 100 the r2 of the gbr decreased by 5 5 while that of the etr decreased by only 1 5 this result indicates that etr has a better inversion effect on tn concentration under the condition of missing data in addition etr was found to enhance randomness based on the rfr this can be explained in that on the one hand instead of using a subset of the training dataset for bootstrap sampling etr uses all training datasets for decision tree construction on the other hand instead of looking for the most discriminative threshold for splitting thresholds are drawn at random for each candidate feature and the best of these randomly generated thresholds is selected as the splitting rule these characteristics improve precision computational efficiency and the ability to over fitting control of etr asadollah et al 2021 geurts et al 2006 john et al 2015 overall it was determined that etr has a better performance than the other six algorithms with regard to r2 0 95 acc 70 rmse 1 6 mg l and mre 15 in addition as a tree model etr has a significant advantage for small scale data processing which requires that the minimum number of input data is only greater than that of characteristic factors hammann and drewe 2012 therefore etr was selected as the optimal algorithm for tn inversion 3 2 prediction accuracy analysis for tn based on etr 3 2 1 applicability analysis for tn prediction based on etr in terms of applicability it is known that training data sources may affect the reliability of models thus the applicability of the etr in all scenarios was analyzed and the results are shown in fig 5 the results showed that when all data were used for training and testing scenario 1 the model performed well with r2 0 97 and the missing data of the randomly mixed dataset from one irrigation drainage unit could be well predicted r2 0 8 when the training and testing datasets were from the same sampling source types for example if the training and testing data were all from fields or ditch scenarios 2 and 3 the model performed well r2 0 9 when the training and testing data were from the same sampling source type but different sampling site positions scenario 4 r2 decreased slightly but the prediction accuracy is still acceptable r2 0 73 in contrast the prediction performed poorly r2 0 when the training and testing datasets were from different sample sources scenarios 5 and 6 in irrigation and drainage units during the rice growing season fields are commonly the source of nitrogen due to fertilizer application while ditches mitigate nitrogen loss because of their important functions in nitrogen retention herzon and helenius 2008 li et al 2020 ye et al 2013 such conditions lead to different physical and chemical relationships between tn and other indexes in fields and ditches thus explaining the poor prediction in scenario 5 and 6 in general these findings indicate that this measurement method is not strict in the selection of sampling sites as long as the environmental backgrounds of the samples are similar moreover data from different sites can be accumulated for use as training data and to increase the sample size 3 2 2 tolerance of missing values for tn prediction based on etr the impact trends of the number of missing variables n and proportion of missing value samples p on the prediction accuracy of the model were consistent fig 5 the prediction accuracy decreased with an increase in n and p but the impact of n was greater the average prediction accuracy decreased by 3 23 when p increased from 25 to 50 4 05 25 to 75 and 8 66 25 to 100 whereas it decreased by 7 82 when n increased from 1 to 2 and 13 29 1 to 3 the impact of p on prediction accuracy was more obvious with a larger n when p increased from 25 to 100 the prediction accuracy decreased by 1 89 n 1 10 97 n 2 and 13 11 n 3 respectively overall the prediction results were acceptable under p 75 with r2 0 82 figs 6 8 show the prediction under different missing variable conditions n 0 1 2 3 p 100 for scenario 1 3 respectively according to the analysis the prediction accuracy of the tn concentration worsened with the increase in missing variables n for scenario 1 when n increased from 0 to 3 the r2 decreased from 0 97 to 0 83 and the acc decreased from 85 42 to 43 75 in addition the mre increased from 10 97 to 38 50 and the rmse increased from 1 25 mg l to 3 09 mg l fig 6 for scenario 2 when n 2 the mre and acc reduced to 36 92 and 53 13 respectively fig 7 d for scenario 3 the accuracy is well for all conditions containing missing value on only one sample site fig 8 b e overall the model accuracy was acceptable when n 2 under all scenarios and the tn concentration could be well predicted 3 3 advantages of the real time measurement method of tn in runoff the contrastive analysis of various monitoring methods for tn in runoff or water bodies is listed in table 3 it should be noted that several challenges exist in high precision and real time monitoring of nps pollution first the minute scale change in surface runoff flow and concentration caused by rainfall increases the requirement for monitoring frequency and duration under stable operation and maintenance water quality automatic monitoring station has a higher accuracy r2 0 90 compared with laboratory test but both require more than 45 min per sample based on the same chemical monitoring method moreover the test frequency of proximal unmanned aerial vehicle and satellite remote sensing inversion is day or month dörnhöfer and oppelt 2016 huangfu et al 2020 such low frequency monitoring methods cannot quickly capture the peak concentration and the change process of pollutants second the monitoring equipment must be able to operate stably under rainy cloudy and nighttime conditions in recent years land based hyperspectral remote sensing rapid inversion technology has emerged with higher accuracy r2 0 8 and monitoring frequency minute scale but is still not suitable for use in rainy or cloudy conditions sun et al 2021 third recall that the monitoring object of nps pollution are small and micro water bodies which increases the requirements for the portability and miniaturization of monitoring equipment yet water quality automatic monitoring stations require relatively large occupied areas and satellite remote sensing inversion is more typically used to monitor larger water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs fourth inherent uncertainties exist in the field monitoring environment which may lead to instrument failure and data loss even losing the monitoring of critical periods of nps pollution and affecting the overall accuracy of water quality monitoring as a new alternative the real time measurement method of tn proposed in this study combines the timeliness of sensor detection and the accuracy of the intelligent algorithm to meet all of the above requirements of nps pollution monitoring first the method can achieve the monitoring frequency at the minute scale with an accuracy of above 0 9 and can be used for rapidly changing runoff monitoring second the sensors used in this method can operate stably under rainy cloudy and nighttime conditions third the sensors can be used in small and micro water bodies such as surface runoff and ditches fourth the prediction accuracy of this method is still acceptable in the case of missing values or variables therefore this method shows great promise for potential applications in monitoring nps pollution 4 conclusions a real time measurement method of tn was proposed for nps monitoring by combining the timeliness of sensor detection and the accuracy of intelligent algorithms based on the physical and chemical relationships between tn and sensor measured indexes the method was found to achieve the monitoring frequency at the minute scale 5 min with an accuracy of above 0 9 the proposed method has good applicability under similar environmental backgrounds fields or ditches in addition the method accuracy is acceptable when the number of missing variables n 2 which makes up for the flaws of missing or abnormal data caused by typical sensor malfunctions compared with methods such as laboratory test remote sensing inversion and water quality automatic monitoring station the proposed method has high precision and real time performance and can operate stably in small and micro water bodies under rainy cloudy and nighttime conditions in future studies more runoff monitoring data will be collected to improve the availability of the model in various regions and a real time measurement method for tp and other nps pollutants will be proposed the new method has potential applications in high frequency monitoring of nps pollution and may be able to provide important technological support for pre warning and emergency control of nps pollution hubei provincial engineering research

16358,real time monitoring of non point source nps pollution is challenging owing to the minute scale change in runoff flow and concentration under rainfall condition in this study we proposed a real time measurement method for total nitrogen tn by combining the timeliness of sensor detection and the accuracy of intelligent algorithms based on the physical and chemical relationships between tn and sensor measured indexes extra tree regression was selected as the tn inversion algorithm which has high precision high computational efficiency and better ability in over fitting control the results show that 1 the real time inversion algorithm of tn can achieve the monitoring frequency at the minute scale 5 min 2 the method performs well r2 0 9 when the training and testing datasets are from similar environmental backgrounds fields or ditches 3 in the case of partial variable missing this method can still realize tn inversion and the prediction accuracy is acceptable r2 0 7 under the number of missing variables n 2 which makes up for the flaws of missing or abnormal data caused by sensor malfunctions overall the proposed real time measurement method of tn has stable data acquisition high precision and high monitoring frequency in addition the method is not limited by cloudy rainy or nighttime conditions compared with methods such as laboratory test remote sensing inversion and water quality automatic monitoring station our method has obvious advantages in runoff monitoring of nps pollution which mainly occurs in small and micro water bodies the new real time

is a severe global threat to the water environment cheng et al 2019 ongley et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 causing water eutrophication or other forms of pollution by picking up pollutants and depositing them into receiving water bodies including rivers lakes and reservoirs by runoff under rainfall or snowmelt conditions usepa 2003 monitoring is the basis for the effective control and supervision of agricultural nps pollution unlike rivers and lakes with relatively stable water quantity and quality the spatiotemporal heterogeneous nature of nps makes it difficult to achieve effective monitoring wang et al 2019 when nps pollution occurs the water quantity and quality of surface runoff change rapidly over a short period especially in the first 30 min of the initial rainfall phase delpla et al 2011 characteristics such as this put forward higher requirements for nps pollution monitoring frequency and effectiveness among the common pollutants total nitrogen tn is an important indicator of eutrophication caused by nps pollution li et al 2021 zhuang et al 2019 in field experiments manual measurement is the conventional monitoring method for surface runoff tn concentration which is mainly processed through laboratory experiments after manual sampling using runoff collection devices runoff collection ponds tanks or buckets such methods are notoriously laborious and time consuming bah et al 2020 chen et al 2017 kang et al 2006 wang et al 2015 recently water quality automatic monitoring station has been increasingly applied to online monitoring chen et al 2016 hillel et al 2015 however the related monitoring frequency is approximately 45 min per sample based on the chemical method which is insufficient to reveal the dynamic change of pollutants in the runoff process within hypo rainfall events as another method water environment remote sensing technology has also been widely used especially in large scale monitoring of surface water quality but such technology is generally limited by the nature of its temporal spatial resolution and susceptibility to influence by weather conditions cloudy or rainy alexakis et al 2019 goetz et al 2008 oki and yasuoka 2008 wang et al 2020a in addition the occurrence and transport of nps pollutants mainly occur in small or micro water bodies such as field outlets ditches and ponds yet both water quality automatic monitoring station and remote sensing inversion are only suitable for large and medium sized water bodies or relatively stable water bodies therefore in general current tn monitoring methods are not suitable for real time monitoring of nps pollution sensor method can carry out rapid and continuous monitoring of water quality dybko et al 1998 mendez barroso et al 2020 wang et al 2020b using this method the most common monitoring indicators include ph electrical conductivity ec oxidation reduction potential orp water temperature t dissolved oxygen do ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and chlorophyll a yet there is a lack of mature sensors that can be directly used for the rapid monitoring of tn concentration on the one hand the chemical and physical correlations between tn and these sensor measured indicators have been proved to be significant kim and furumai 2013 ma et al 2021 on the other hand intelligent algorithms such as decision tree models are a powerful means of modeling data without much prior preparation hammann and drewe 2012 both the chemical and physical correlations and the intelligent algorithms provide possibilities for indirect tn inversion which are an important theoretical basis and technological support respectively given the current insufficient intelligence of nps pollution monitoring technologies and difficulties of high frequency monitoring this study aims to 1 propose a real time measurement method of tn by combining the timeliness of sensor detection and the accuracy of intelligent algorithms and 2 clarify the applicable conditions the sampling environmental backgrounds and the tolerance for missing values of the proposed method 2 methods and data the framework and application scenario of the real time measurement method of tn for runoff are shown in fig 1 in the proposed method real time conventional water quality data were collected by stable multiparameter sensors installed in field outlets and ditches and were transferred to a master computer then all of the monitoring data were merged and transferred to a cloud server where the tn concentrations were predicted based on the intelligent algorithm finally real time tn concentrations were received at the user terminals 2 1 data set and sources the selected study region was a typical paddy irrigation and drainage unit in the yangtze river basin located in anlu city hubei province china fig 2 a at the base fertilizer stage and tillering stage of rice in may july 2018 we set up five field sites 1 5 and one ditch site 6 to monitor the outflow water quality using water quality parameter sensors fig 2b table 1 runoff samples were collected every 10 min in the first hour and every 20 min in the second hour after the runoff generation over the following two hours when water levels stabilized runoff samples were collected once every hour until the end of runoff generation according to the regional runoff characteristics seven variables including ph ec μs cm orp mv t do mg l nh4 n mg l and no3 n mg l were selected as input indicators for tn inversion the tn concentration was tested by the national standard method synchronously ph ec orp t nh4 n and no3 n were acquired using electrochemical sensors and do was acquired using a fluorescence sensor in total 8 variables and 192 groups of data were obtained 2 2 algorithms for tn inversion intelligent algorithm has been proven to be effective and efficient solutions to nonlinear regression problems with a high predictive ability and the advantages of automated statistical modeling processes chen et al 2018 hanoon et al 2021 in this study the tn concentration was predicted by intelligent algorithm given the seven sensor measured variables to obtain the optimal multiparameter fitting seven algorithms were examined to evaluate their predictive ability linear support vector regression svr brereton and lloyd 2010 were et al 2015 yu et al 2006 k nearest neighbors knn goodfellow et al 2016 lee and ouarda

2015 gradient boosting regression gbr friedman 2001 tao et al 2021 and extra tree regression etr geurts et al 2006 among them rfr gbr and etr are common ensemble algorithm modules based on trees and are contained in the scikit learn library based on the python programming language http scikit learn org preliminary assessment and screening of the seven algorithms were conducted based on the tn prediction accuracy their applicability and tolerance to missing values were further tested fig 3 the same training and testing data were used in all algorithms 2 3 applicability analysis considering the impact of environmental backgrounds it can be expected that the models established based on datasets from certain monitoring sites may not perform well at others thus we conducted an applicability analysis with six scenarios scenarios 1 6 to evaluate the impact of training site heterogeneity on the stability and adaptability of the models table 2 the tn inversion accuracy was analyzed and compared based on the monitoring source types of runoff samples field or ditch the scenarios were divided into the following categories training and testing data from all sample sources scenario 1 training and testing data from the same sample sources scenarios 2 and 3 and training and testing data from different sample sources scenarios 4 5 and 6 for scenarios 1 3 with the same data sources the proportion of training data and testing data was 75 and 25 respectively for scenarios 4 6 the training and testing data were composed of all data from the different sample sources 2 4 tolerance test to missing values missing values which are generally common in environmental monitoring data tend to affect the data quality or even the immediate assessment of the water environment however the tolerance to missing values varies among each algorithm which greatly affects the prediction accuracy of tn inversion in this study to test the tolerance of the algorithms to missing values we set n the number of missing input variables and p the proportion of data groups containing missing values to assess the missing condition of monitoring data four levels were set for n 0 1 2 and 3 and p 0 25 50 and 100 respectively considering that the missing condition of the data impacts the statistical analyses the missing values were completely random little 1988 further the mean imputation was used to fill in the missing values with the mean value of training data luengo et al 2010 norazian et al 2008 son and kim 2020 2 5 accuracy assessment the prediction accuracy of the models for tn concentration was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 relative error re mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and accuracy acc which were calculated using the follow equations 1 r 2 1 i 1 n y i f i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 2 r e f i y i y i 100 3 m r e i 1 n r e n 4 r m s e i 1 n f i y i 2 n 5 a c c n a n 100 where yi is the actual value fi is the prediction value y is the actual mean value n is the sample capacity and na is the number of predicted values of re within 20 li et al 2017 moriasi et al 2015 the best possible score for r2 is 1 0 a negative r2 indicated that a model was arbitrarily worse and an r2 score of 0 indicated that a model consistently predicted the expected value of yi disregarding the input features 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal algorithm selection the prediction accuracy of the seven algorithms was summarized for when the proportion of data groups containing missing values was 0 25 50 75 and 100 respectively fig 4 the results showed that etr gbr rfr and dtr all showed a good fit based on all data with no missing values n 0 p 0 with r2 greater than 0 92 acc greater than 70 rmse less than 2 1 mg l and mre less than 16 2 in general ensemble algorithm modules which construct a strong ensemble learner by incorporating several weak learners based on ensemble system approaches bagging boosting or stacking enhance the performance of the model by reducing the over fitting concerns thus resulting in higher prediction reliability farooq et al 2021 the knn method showed the worst prediction with r2 0 47 and rmse 5 5 mg l which can be explained by the discrepancy when determining k the number of nearest neighbors leading to a low accuracy with error or high dimensional data lee and ouarda 2011 further it was required to have an algorithm that could maintain good fitting accuracy when some data were missing therefore the fitting accuracy after randomly removing one variable in each sample n 1 was evaluated with the increase in the proportion of missing value samples p differences in the fitting accuracy emerged the fitting accuracy of the etr decreased more slowly despite the slightly lower fitting accuracy for the overall data compared with gbr when p increased from 25 to 100 the r2 of the gbr decreased by 5 5 while that of the etr decreased by only 1 5 this result indicates that etr has a better inversion effect on tn concentration under the condition of missing data in addition etr was found to enhance randomness based on the rfr this can be explained in that on the one hand instead of using a subset of the training dataset for bootstrap sampling etr uses all training datasets for decision tree construction on the other hand instead of looking for the most discriminative threshold for splitting thresholds are drawn at random for each candidate feature and the best of these randomly generated thresholds is selected as the splitting rule these characteristics improve precision computational efficiency and the ability to over fitting control of etr asadollah et al 2021 geurts et al 2006 john et al 2015 overall it was determined that etr has a better performance than the other six algorithms with regard to r2 0 95 acc 70 rmse 1 6 mg l and mre 15 in addition as a tree model etr has a significant advantage for small scale data processing which requires that the minimum number of input data is only greater than that of characteristic factors hammann and drewe 2012 therefore etr was selected as the optimal algorithm for tn inversion 3 2 prediction accuracy analysis for tn based on etr 3 2 1 applicability analysis for tn prediction based on etr in terms of applicability it is known that training data sources may affect the reliability of models thus the applicability of the etr in all scenarios was analyzed and the results are shown in fig 5 the results showed that when all data were used for training and testing scenario 1 the model performed well with r2 0 97 and the missing data of the randomly mixed dataset from one irrigation drainage unit could be well predicted r2 0 8 when the training and testing datasets were from the same sampling source types for example if the training and testing data were all from fields or ditch scenarios 2 and 3 the model performed well r2 0 9 when the training and testing data were from the same sampling source type but different sampling site positions scenario 4 r2 decreased slightly but the prediction accuracy is still acceptable r2 0 73 in contrast the prediction performed poorly r2 0 when the training and testing datasets were from different sample sources scenarios 5 and 6 in irrigation and drainage units during the rice growing season fields are commonly the source of nitrogen due to fertilizer application while ditches mitigate nitrogen loss because of their important functions in nitrogen retention herzon and helenius 2008 li et al 2020 ye et al 2013 such conditions lead to different physical and chemical relationships between tn and other indexes in fields and ditches thus explaining the poor prediction in scenario 5 and 6 in general these findings indicate that this measurement method is not strict in the selection of sampling sites as long as the environmental backgrounds of the samples are similar moreover data from different sites can be accumulated for use as training data and to increase the sample size 3 2 2 tolerance of missing values for tn prediction based on etr the impact trends of the number of missing variables n and proportion of missing value samples p on the prediction accuracy of the model were consistent fig 5 the prediction accuracy decreased with an increase in n and p but the impact of n was greater the average prediction accuracy decreased by 3 23 when p increased from 25 to 50 4 05 25 to 75 and 8 66 25 to 100 whereas it decreased by 7 82 when n increased from 1 to 2 and 13 29 1 to 3 the impact of p on prediction accuracy was more obvious with a larger n when p increased from 25 to 100 the prediction accuracy decreased by 1 89 n 1 10 97 n 2 and 13 11 n 3 respectively overall the prediction results were acceptable under p 75 with r2 0 82 figs 6 8 show the prediction under different missing variable conditions n 0 1 2 3 p 100 for scenario 1 3 respectively according to the analysis the prediction accuracy of the tn concentration worsened with the increase in missing variables n for scenario 1 when n increased from 0 to 3 the r2 decreased from 0 97 to 0 83 and the acc decreased from 85 42 to 43 75 in addition the mre increased from 10 97 to 38 50 and the rmse increased from 1 25 mg l to 3 09 mg l fig 6 for scenario 2 when n 2 the mre and acc reduced to 36 92 and 53 13 respectively fig 7 d for scenario 3 the accuracy is well for all conditions containing missing value on only one sample site fig 8 b e overall the model accuracy was acceptable when n 2 under all scenarios and the tn concentration could be well predicted 3 3 advantages of the real time measurement method of tn in runoff the contrastive analysis of various monitoring methods for tn in runoff or water bodies is listed in table 3 it should be noted that several challenges exist in high precision and real time monitoring of nps pollution first the minute scale change in surface runoff flow and concentration caused by rainfall increases the requirement for monitoring frequency and duration under stable operation and maintenance water quality automatic monitoring station has a higher accuracy r2 0 90 compared with laboratory test but both require more than 45 min per sample based on the same chemical monitoring method moreover the test frequency of proximal unmanned aerial vehicle and satellite remote sensing inversion is day or month dörnhöfer and oppelt 2016 huangfu et al 2020 such low frequency monitoring methods cannot quickly capture the peak concentration and the change process of pollutants second the monitoring equipment must be able to operate stably under rainy cloudy and nighttime conditions in recent years land based hyperspectral remote sensing rapid inversion technology has emerged with higher accuracy r2 0 8 and monitoring frequency minute scale but is still not suitable for use in rainy or cloudy conditions sun et al 2021 third recall that the monitoring object of nps pollution are small and micro water bodies which increases the requirements for the portability and miniaturization of monitoring equipment yet water quality automatic monitoring stations require relatively large occupied areas and satellite remote sensing inversion is more typically used to monitor larger water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs fourth inherent uncertainties exist in the field monitoring environment which may lead to instrument failure and data loss even losing the monitoring of critical periods of nps pollution and affecting the overall accuracy of water quality monitoring as a new alternative the real time measurement method of tn proposed in this study combines the timeliness of sensor detection and the accuracy of the intelligent algorithm to meet all of the above requirements of nps pollution monitoring first the method can achieve the monitoring frequency at the minute scale with an accuracy of above 0 9 and can be used for rapidly changing runoff monitoring second the sensors used in this method can operate stably under rainy cloudy and nighttime conditions third the sensors can be used in small and micro water bodies such as surface runoff and ditches fourth the prediction accuracy of this method is still acceptable in the case of missing values or variables therefore this method shows great promise for potential applications in monitoring nps pollution 4 conclusions a real time measurement method of tn was proposed for nps monitoring by combining the timeliness of sensor detection and the accuracy of intelligent algorithms based on the physical and chemical relationships between tn and sensor measured indexes the method was found to achieve the monitoring frequency at the minute scale 5 min with an accuracy of above 0 9 the proposed method has good applicability under similar environmental backgrounds fields or ditches in addition the method accuracy is acceptable when the number of missing variables n 2 which makes up for the flaws of missing or abnormal data caused by typical sensor malfunctions compared with methods such as laboratory test remote sensing inversion and water quality automatic monitoring station the proposed method has high precision and real time performance and can operate stably in small and micro water bodies under rainy cloudy and nighttime conditions in future studies more runoff monitoring data will be collected to improve the availability of the model in various regions and a real time measurement method for tp and other nps pollutants will be proposed the new method has potential applications in high frequency monitoring of nps pollution and may be able to provide important technological support for pre warning and emergency control of nps pollution hubei provincial engineering research

16359,the james r dolorio water reclamation facility in pueblo colorado uses avn aeration controls to lower aeration energy while promoting carbon efficient nutrient removal and hydrocyclone based wasting to achieve svi improvements and process intensification the results from the full scale installation showed that hydrocyclone based wasting helped improve settling characteristics by reducing the svi from 200 52 ml g to 83 22 ml g within weeks of operation pao and nitrifiers were preferentially retained in dense flocs and granules while lighter heterotrophic and filamentous organisms were preferentially wasted thus uncoupling the srt of these two fractions relative to the overall srt the srt was estimated at 14 4 3 4 days for dense aggregates and 7 1 2 3 days for lighter flocs the use of avn control with continuous low do conditions resulted in low do conditions 0 3 mgo2 l reducing air demand by 50 while providing excellent nitrogen effluent tin 11 mgn l and tp removal effluent tp

attributed to the energy and carbon efficient biological nutrient removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aerobic granular sludge avn control denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms densification low dissolved oxygen 1 introduction to meet the competing demands of rapid population growth finite resources and climate change water resource recovery facilities wrrfs are looking to simultaneously increase treatment capacity meet more stringent effluent discharge standards and reduce their energy and carbon footprint typically addressing these needs requires the expensive construction of additional infrastructures such as additional aeration basins and secondary clarifiers less expensive alternatives are a wave of more compact and efficient treatment technologies such as integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas membrane bioreactors mbrs moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr and membrane aerated biofilm reactors mabr these approaches offer intensification within existing processes but often have much higher energy demands aerobic granular sludge ags is defined as a self immobilized or self agglutinated biofilm granules may be interpreted as dense flocs or part of a continuum of the activated sludge process that has been in practice for over 100 years ags is gaining popularity over conventional activated sludge systems due to excellent settling characteristics which allow greater treatment i e tanks can be operated at higher biomass concentrations within the same volume de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 batch wise operation with well defined feast famine and short settling times have been proven to be highly effective in promoting sludge granulation resulting in many full scale applications however granulation in continuous flow systems which represents the majority of conventional activated sludge systems worldwide is not well understood to form granules within a continuous flow system the critical selective pressures to promote good settling sludge must be applied efficiently these include anaerobic anoxic feeding gray et al 2007 plug flow conditions kolle 1966 bhatla 1967 chudoba et al 1973a 1973b heide et al 1974 tomlinson et al 1976 1978a 1978b wu et al 1984 and substrate loading sezgin et al 1978 further an external selector device such as hydrocyclone based wasting can enhance the settleability and densification of sludge leading to granulation bott et al 2018 the large aggregate size of ags makes simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal possible in one reactor due to large diffusion gradients of electron donors and acceptors creating different redox conditions within the granule this enables the growth of different guilds of microorganisms in different layers of the granule de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2005 szabó et al 2017a to complement densification there is a desire to promote energy and carbon efficient nutrient removal which could be facilitated by the low dissolved oxygen do conditions allowing simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd however there is a concern that granulation results in higher diffusion limitation resulting in reduced biological activity undermining the capacity improvements of good settling sludge strubbe et al 2022 consequently the low do conditions needed for snd might result in lower nitrification capacity for example the apparent oxygen half saturation ko2 higher diffusion limitation causes higher ko2 of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob drive the required do levels at a given solids retention time srt and temperature thus the higher the ko2 the higher the required do levels needed which limits the much desired snd nitrifiers have been shown to adapt to low do park and noguera 2004 liu and wang 2013 keene et al 2017 which translates to lower ko2 based on the literature ko2 varies as it may be affected by advection diffusion and guilds of different aob and nob manser et al 2005 arnaldos et al 2015 in granular sludge systems the interplay of ko2 and redox conditions within the granule can lead to the selection of microorganisms that are capable of nitrogen and phosphorus removal moreover denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dpaos can reduce carbon and oxygen requirements kuba et al 1996 since polyhydroxyalkanoates pha are stored by paos in anaerobic conditions and used as an internal reservoir for snd under aerobic conditions in this study we show for the first time that the implementation of hydrocyclone based wasting and continuous low do ammonia vs nox avn control at a full scale bnr facility furthermore the results show that densification is compatible with efficient low do nutrient removal without compromising nitrification capacity or the overall intensification of the process selective retention of slower growing nitrifiers and paos in the granules seems to hold the key for such performance 2 materials

skid mounted units each comprising four 10 m3 per hour m3 h hydrocyclones total of eight hydrocyclones were used for wasting each hydrocyclone is 126 mm in diameter and 850 mm in height the nozzle tip of the hydrocylone is 18 mm in diameter at the jd wrf the hydrocyclones are fed a portion on average around 6 of the ras the feed to the hydrocyclone splits into overflow waste fraction which is around 80 and underflow retained fraction which is around 20 the hydrocyclone is operated continuously and no other wasting strategy was practiced the waste activated sludge was exits the overflow stream and the underflow is returned to the activated sludge process advanced aeration control avn control was applied as described in regmi et al 2016 this study was the first ever full scale implementation of continuous avn control based on fluctuating do levels which is different than the intermittent avn as described by regmi et al 2014 based on fluctuating aerobic and anoxic times with continuous avn aeration control real time ammonia measurement is compared to the nox concentration in the effluent channel of the aerobic tank to maintain equal ammonia and nox concentrations in the

nitrogen and phosphorus species using hach tnt kits do ph and temperature values were recorded directly in the biological basins settling particle characterization and solids retention time to study the impact of the hydrocyclones on the mixed liquor characteristics settling and sieve analysis were performed sieve analysis was performed according to van loosdrecht et al 2016 to determine the impact of the hydrocyclones on the floc size distribution of the mixed liquor for this study the particles and aggregates that were retained in the sieve with size larger than 200 μm were defined as granules and those that passed the sieve 200 µm were considered flocs sludge volume index svi 30 min settling time for the overflow underflow and mixed liquor samples were performed according to methods outlined in standard method 2710d apha 2017 solids retention time srt in days is equal to the mass of mlss in the bnr reactors kg divided by the mass of solids wasted each day kg day the floc

granule srt is calculated as the biomass inventory greater than 200 µm in the mlss numerator divided by the mass of solids wasted greater than 200 µm in the overflow denominator as the presence of granules in the effluent was assumed to be insignificant batch activity assays to measure maximum aob and nob activity rates 4 l mixed liquor samples were collected from the ras and aerated for 30 min to oxidize excess cod dispensed into 4 l vessels and spiked with 20 30 mgn l nh4 n as ammonium chloride and 2 4 mgn l no2 n as sodium nitrite respectively and sampled continuously for 1 h at 15 min

c1000 cfx96 real time pcr system bio rad hercules ca usa extracellular polymeric substances a heat extraction method li and yang 2007 was used to extract the loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps from the mixed liquor samples a sludge suspension was first dewatered by centrifugation in a 50 ml tube at 4000 g for 5 min the centrate liquor was recovered for water quality analysis the sludge pellet in the tube was then resuspended into 15 ml of 0 05 nacl solution that had a similar salinity to the solution in the as reactor the sludge mixture was then diluted with the nacl solution to its original volume of 50 ml the nacl solution for dilution was pre heated to 70 c to ensure that the sludge suspension reached an immediate warm temperature of 50 c without any delay the sludge suspension was then sheared by a vortex mixer for 1 min followed by centrifugation at 4000 g for 10 min the organic matter in the supernatant was readily extractable eps and was cataloged as the lb eps of the biomass for the extraction of the tb eps the sludge pellets left in the centrifuge tubes were resuspended in 0 05 nacl solution to its original volume of 50 ml the sludge suspension was heated to 60 c in a water bath for 30 min and the sludge mixture was then centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 min the supernatant that was collected was cataloged as the tb eps both the lb eps and tb eps extractions were analyzed for total cod 3 results and discussion key results are presented for three time periods 1 before hydrocylones were installed from january 1 2019 to may 31 2019 2 during implementation of the hydrocyclones and avn control from june 1 2019 to july 1 2019 and 3 after operation of hydrocylones and avn control from july 1 2019 to march 20 2020 data are presented to demonstrate improvements in sludge quality and densification achieved using the external selector hydrocyclone based wasting and low do for carbon and energy efficient nutrient removal avn control finally srt uncoupling was estimated to understand process stability and resilience improvements by recovering slow growing desired organisms like phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and nitrifiers 3 1 sludge densification sludge volume index historical svi data for the jr wrf is summarized in table 1 the data represents different periods and conditions experienced over the past four years of operation at the plant historically the mixed liquor svi has been variable with common bulking episodes that have increased the svi to values as high as 400 ml g during the start up of the bnr plant 2016 2017 the svi averaged 150 ml g during this period the average f m in the anaerobic selector averaged 2 0 0 9 gcod gvss the high svis were caused primarily by the prevalence of microthrix parvicella during cold conditions to improve the svi poly aluminum chloride pacl was added in 2018 which resulted in a reduction of svi to 114 35 ml g to reduce the pacl addition and the costs associated with the chemical addition for svi control technologies were explored to densify the mixed liquor as a result the hydrocyclone technology was implemented and started up in june 2019 the approach for using the hydrocyclone was to waste and lower the srt of the less dense organisms including filaments through a process of deselection and to retain denser and granular organisms at a higher operating srt the svi values from january 2019 to may 2019 prior to use of the hydrocyclone were typical of bulking sludges with significant variability with values ranging between 128 and 316 ml g and an overall average value of approximately 200 ml g fig 1 after the implementation of the hydrocyclones there was a drastic improvement in svi as the 50th percentile svi dropped to 90 ml g the f m ratio before and after the implementation of hydrocyclones were the same data not shown indicating there were no changes to the overall substrate selection pressures svi improvement was immediately observed within two weeks of hydrocyclone operation as svi values decreased from 160 ml g to 85 ml g historically jd wrf suffered from poor settling in the winter months the average svi from january 2019 to march 2019 was 230 ml g in contrast the svi values for the same period in 2020 with the hydrocyclone averaged 104 ml g as more granules are formed the svi5 svi obtained after 5 min settling gets closer to the svi svi obtained after 30 min of settling the presence of bigger granules can be seen in the underflow in fig s3 therefore the ratio of svi svi5 is an intermediate indicator to examine the initial granulation in a combined granule floc system the rapid improvement in svi was marked by the initial more rapid decrease of svi5 relative to svi thus increasing the ratio of svi svi5 as it got as high as 0 8 after the operation of hydrocyclones fig 1 after that the svi improved and the svi svi5 ratio stabilized at 0 6 for combined granule floc systems moreover the hydrocyclone provides uncoupling of srt such that the granular fraction of the densified biomass had 2 times the srt of the flocculent fraction table 1 this uncoupling of srt provided by the hydrocyclone eventually led to better settling characteristics of the overall biomass as flocculent particles were wasted more aggressively fig 2 a shows the svi values increased steadily from november 2019 to january 2020 and then decreased to an average of 95 ml g from february to april 2020 considering there were no major process changes the increased srt as a response to lower wastewater temperature seemed to be the main factor that impacted svi fig 2a as the srt was increased the mass wasting from the system was reduced hence less biomass was exposed to the deselection offered by the hydrocyclones and more of the lighter less dense particles were retained in the system which negatively impacted the settling characteristics fig 2b shows the impact of srt on svi the longer srt means less exposure of the biomass to the deselection associated with the hydrocyclone reducing the overall deselection pressure consequently the increase in srt during the onset of fall resulted in higher svi sieve analysis the results were aggregated into tss greater than 200 μm to demonstrate the selection of particle sizes with hydrocyclone operation the trends of tss greater than 200 μm for hydrocyclone fractions are shown in fig 3 a as expected the greater the fraction of 200 μm particles the lower the svi and better settleability during january 2020 the svi of the underflow was as high as 97 ml g however the tss fraction greater than 200 μm remained above 57 which indicated there was not a significant loss of denser particles during this time subsequently it also suggested that as the lighter particles are wasted gradually and the sludge inventory decreases the svi improves which was seen by the improvements in svi after february fig 3a the data shows that with hydrocyclone operation 52 of the particles in mlss were greater than 200 μm while 40 and 70 of the overflow and underflow respectively were greater than 200 μm fig 3b this clearly demonstrates that larger particles are retained in the underflow of the hydrocyclone extracellular polymeric substance with the use of hydrocyclones densified biological flocs and aerobic granules accumulate in the system key differences between ordinary biological flocs densified biological flocs and aerobic granules are their size and the content of eps mcswain et al 2005 in this study a rapid increase in tb eps was observed after the hydrocyclones were commissioned it increased from 200 to 500 mgcod gvss within one month of operation fig 4 a during this time there was a significant improvement in settling characteristics svi decreased by 100 ml g while tss 200 µm increased the eps content remained relatively constant around 500 mg cod gvss over a ten month period shown in fig 4a which also spans winter operation the stability of the particles greater than 200 µm can be attributed to the high tb eps content lb eps on the other hand decreased as the particle size distribution increased lower ranges of lb eps coincided with higher tss 200 µm and vice versa fig 4b the total eps tb plus lb eps production has been shown to be a function of the substrate utilization rate jimenez et al 2015 in this study the average f m in the anaerobic selector averaged 2 0 0 9 gcod gvss before and after implementation of the hydrocyclones which is above the design guidance for anaerobic selectors of 1 5 kg total cod kgmlss d water environment federation 2018 the substrate profile was already present to create a selector zone of high substrate uptake and the implementation of the hydrocyclone selectively recycled dense particles to this zone the data indicates that the anaerobic selector and the hydocyclone together resulted in a rapid increase in tb eps production and sludge densification these observations are consistent with the observed increase of eps content up to 300 mg cod gvss in a full scale installation with anaerobic selectors which also reported low svis of 80 ml g jimenez et al 2020 3 2 nutrient removal phosphorus removal the primary mechanism of phosphorus p removal at jd wrf is enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr to overcome the carbon limitation especially vfa of the primary effluent acetic acid was historically added to the anaerobic zone to promote the growth of pao despite this addition of acetic acid the ebpr performance at jd wrf was inconsistent and did not meet the effluent tp limit of 1 mgp l reliably the ebpr performance with hydrocyclone is seen for the effluent trends in fig 5 a starting in june of 2019 after three months of hydrocyclone operation the variability of effluent tp was significantly reduced and the concentration remained below 1 0 mg p l consistently historically ebpr has been more inconsistent during the winter months december march and in addition to supplemental carbon acetic acid chemical p removal was needed using pacl the combination of hydrocyclone and avn control proved effective in maintaining stable ebpr performance during winter months without the addition of pacl and acetic acid compared to the previous year fig 5b the denser more desirable fraction in the underflow is returned to the activated sludge process by the hydrocyclone and operates at a higher solids residence time since pao containing storage products such as polyphosphate and counterions are likely denser compared to other floc forming organisms schuler et al 2002 they are retained in the system and are typically used to form the core of denser granules resulting in selection pressure that highly is favorable for ebpr to gain further insights into factors affecting ebpr stability and reliability several ex situ phosphate release and uptake batch tests pru were conducted besides to assess pao activity anoxic phosphorus uptake tests were conducted these tests were performed without the addition of external carbon carbon source was provided in the form of primary effluent the trend of pru test results reveals the pao maintained a high degree of activity which was crucial for the observed ebpr performance fig 6 a the average specific p release rate was 5 2 mgp gvss hr while the average p uptake rate was 9 4 mgp gvss hr this resulted in a ratio of p release p uptake of 0 55 which is much lower than 1 6 to 5 0 reported by onnis hayden et al 2020 the retention and enrichment of paos and lower influent p 5 mgp l resulting in lower intracellular p may have attributed to lower p release rates compared to the uptake rates in this study to test the impact of low do on the p uptake two pru tests were conducted at 0 2 mgo2 l the average specific p uptake rate for these two tests was 9 6 mgp gvss hr demonstrating that lower operating do did not impact p uptake for the entire experimental period the in basin do was below 0 4 mgo2 l therefore aeration savings associated with low do operation did not carry the penalty of reducing ebpr performance the ex situ anoxic p uptake test suggested the presence of dpao activity contributing to combined n and p removal within the bnr configuration fig 6b the anoxic p uptake was on average 36 of the aerobic p uptake the carbon utilized by dpao has two fold benefits nitrogen is removed in the anoxic zone as well as decreases the carbon entering the aerated zone thus reducing oxygen energy consumption associated with aerobic oxidation of carbon the more stable ebpr performance after hydrocyclone implementation could be attributed to dpao activity at jd wrf it is also important note that acetic acid addition discontinued prior to the study a much lower anoxic p uptake around 19 of the aerobic p uptake has been reported in a similar process configuration without the hydrocyclones and a higher 49 with a process configuration also with hydrocyclones wrf 2019 although dpao activity was not evaluated in underflow relative to overflow the relationship of higher density with pao presence by schuler et al 2002 suggests that anoxic srt limited dpao could increase with srt uncoupling nitrogen removal the 50th percentile effluent tin was 11 mgn l which is well below the effluent limit of 15 mgn l on an annual average basis before the avn control was implemented the effluent tin was 15 20 mgn l data not shown despite the variability the 90th percentile effluent tin was 15 2 mgn l which indicates that the process optimized with hydrocyclone and avn control was fully capable of meeting effluent nitrogen requirements at jd wrf this is even more significant considering that both ebpr and nitrogen removal were being sustained despite the limited carbon availability in the primary effluent c n ratio 6 0 1 6 thus the tin removal efficiency is a good indicator of nitrogen removal performance by the bnr process at jd wrf the tin removal has seen some variability due to seasonal and process changes some were related to the fine tuning of avn control as seen in fig 7 a the 50th percentile tin removal performance was 76 which is slightly lower than 78 which was observed in the early part of 2019 before hydrocyclone and avn control implementation the average effluent ammonia concentration was 2 6 mgn l while the effluent nox n nitrate nitrite concentration was 9 1 mgn l after the implementation of avn control starting at the first week of july in 2019 the reason for this deviation was due to the limitation of the aeration system lower limit of aeration blower turndown which did not allow the biological process to operate below the do of 0 2 mgo2 l consequently optimal levels of denitrification were not realized during low ammonia loading conditions which contributed to higher effluent tin levels to gain further insights into factors affecting nitrification performance several ex situ specific nitrification rate snr batch tests were conducted the test involved aerating the mixed liquor sample 4 mg o2 l while providing a high starting ammonia concentration 25 mgnh4 n l and addition of alkalinity to maintain neutral ph the main objective was to assess the activity of aob to convert ammonia to nitrite first step and nob to convert nitrite to nitrate second step of nitrification the batch test involves aeration over time 2 h where the production of nitrite and nitrate as well as ammonia is monitored the trends of a specific activity in mgn gvss hr of aob and nob are presented in fig 7b the specific activity of aob averaged 4 1 mgn gvss hr while the average specific activity of nob was also 4 14 mgn gvss hr this suggests a healthy population of nitrifiers and there was no inhibition of nitrification at jd wrf in fact the specific nitrification rates are comparable to srt uncoupled hybrid biofilm based processes using flocs and mbbr regmi et al 2011 aobmedia 4 97 mgn gmlss hr aobsuspended 1 72 mgn gmlss hr and were supported by the 1 2 srtfloc srtgranule uncoupling also seen here in a floc and granule process table 1 since the specific activity of aob and nob were essentially very close fig 7b it can be concluded that there was no nob out selection therefore nitrogen removal via nitrite nitrite shunt did not occur and the carbon savings associated with this shortcut pathway was not realized the aeration basin do levels were being managed by the avn control system starting july 1 2019 the avn control drove do to very low levels and avoided over aeration while maintaining required nitrification the distribution of do levels clearly indicates that at jd wrf nitrification is occurring at low oxygen conditions as a result avn control the plant can maintain consistently low do levels the 50th percentile do is 0 26 mg o2 l fig 8 a suggesting that the nitrifier population or the adapted morphology is well adapted in these low do conditions the trends of do is presented in figure s3 the major advantage of low do operation translated into significant aeration savings at jd wrf under the normal operation of maintaining do 2 mg o2 l jd wrf needed to use two aeration blowers 8374 nm3 h each however with reduced aeration demand under the avn control only one aeration blower was sufficient and oversized during low loading periods the 90th percentile total airflow was 7728 nm3 h which is less than the capacity of the single blower therefore by not operating one extra blower the plant has accrued significant aeration energy savings 50 the low do adaptation of the nitrifiers is further substantiated by the molecular results suggesting the dominant presence of nitropsira species of nob functioning as complete ammonia oxidizers comammox roots et al 2019 as shown in fig 8b relative to conventional aob population temporal variation of comammox amoa nxrb and pao during the study is provided in fig s4 further the adaptation of nitrifier or morphology to low do conditions was clearly demonstrated by the fact that at do of 0 2 mg o2 l and 0 8 mg o2 l the specific nitrification rates were 50 and 93 respectively compared to the test conducted at 4 mg o2 l fig 9 a besides there was also evidence that the hydrocyclone could be retaining nitrifiers in the underflow compared to what is wasted in the overflow fig 9b shows that the specific nitrification rate in the underflow was 30 higher than in the overflow therefore the slower growing nitrifiers were being retained in the granules and experiencing longer srt 2 times more srt than the flocculent biomass compared to less desirable organisms that were selectively wasted in the overflow this srt uncoupling confers extra process capacity safety factor and thereby provides process stability and resilience the low do adaptation coupled with selective retention of nitrifiers by the hydrocyclone leveraged avn control to drive the do levels low and help realize significant aeration savings 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrated energy and carbon efficient nutrient removal with the following conclusions intensification settling improved dramatically within weeks of the hydrocyclone start up svi values decreased from approximately 200 ml g to 90 ml g on average after start up historical filament problems improved and the plant has eliminated the usage of chemical settling aids previously required especially during winter months improved svi allows for an increase in process capacity by supporting higher mlss or lower first order do concentration process resilience the srt of granules and flocs were uncoupled with a 2 granule to 1 floc ratio supporting an uncoupled srt ratio of also 2 1 as calculated with the srt formula batch activity test results suggest excellent ebpr supporting that the hydrocyclone helped uncouple to preferentially select dense paos and anoxic srt limited dpaos thus increasing process resilience similarly slower growing nitrifiers were retained in the underflow of the hydrocyclone in excess of wasted overflow low average do 0 3 mgo2 l maintained by the avn control suggested no nitrification capacity limitation with granulation carbon and energy efficiency efficient n removal with tn 11 mgn l and tp 1 mgp l was maintained at cod n ratio of 6 1 without adding external chemicals batch activity tests shown an enrichment of low do adapted nitrifiers presence of comammox yielding high nitrification rates consequently avn control has maintained low do conditions resulting in significant aeration savings for

16359,the james r dolorio water reclamation facility in pueblo colorado uses avn aeration controls to lower aeration energy while promoting carbon efficient nutrient removal and hydrocyclone based wasting to achieve svi improvements and process intensification the results from the full scale installation showed that hydrocyclone based wasting helped improve settling characteristics by reducing the svi from 200 52 ml g to 83 22 ml g within weeks of operation pao and nitrifiers were preferentially retained in dense flocs and granules while lighter heterotrophic and filamentous organisms were preferentially wasted thus uncoupling the srt of these two fractions relative to the overall srt the srt was estimated at 14 4 3 4 days for dense aggregates and 7 1 2 3 days for lighter flocs the use of avn control with continuous low do conditions resulted in low do conditions 0 3 mgo2 l reducing air demand by 50 while providing excellent nitrogen effluent tin 11 mgn l and tp removal effluent tp 1 mgp l at low primary effluent cod n ratio of 6 0 the presence of comammox was demonstrated through molecular analysis while ex situ batch tests revealed the presence of dpao which could have attributed to the energy and carbon efficient biological nutrient removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aerobic granular sludge avn control denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms densification low dissolved oxygen 1 introduction to meet the competing demands of rapid population growth finite resources and climate change water resource recovery facilities wrrfs are looking to simultaneously increase treatment capacity meet more stringent effluent discharge standards and reduce their energy and carbon footprint typically addressing these needs requires the expensive construction of additional infrastructures such as additional aeration basins and secondary clarifiers less expensive alternatives are a wave of more compact and efficient treatment technologies such as integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas membrane bioreactors mbrs moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr and membrane aerated biofilm reactors mabr these approaches offer intensification within existing processes but often have much higher energy demands aerobic granular sludge ags is defined as a self immobilized or self agglutinated biofilm granules may be interpreted as dense flocs or part of a continuum of the activated sludge process that has been in practice for over 100 years ags is gaining popularity over conventional activated sludge systems due to excellent settling characteristics which allow greater treatment i e tanks can be operated at higher biomass concentrations within the same volume de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 batch wise operation with well defined feast famine and short settling times have been proven to be highly effective in promoting sludge granulation resulting in many full scale applications however granulation in continuous flow systems which represents the majority of conventional activated sludge systems worldwide is not well understood to form granules within a continuous flow system the critical selective pressures to promote good settling sludge must be applied efficiently these include anaerobic anoxic feeding gray et al 2007 plug flow conditions kolle 1966 bhatla 1967 chudoba et al 1973a 1973b heide et al 1974 tomlinson et al 1976 1978a 1978b wu et al 1984 and substrate loading sezgin et al 1978 further an external selector device such as hydrocyclone based wasting can enhance the settleability and densification of sludge leading to granulation bott et al 2018 the large aggregate size of ags makes simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal possible in one reactor due to large diffusion gradients of electron donors and acceptors creating different redox conditions within the granule this enables the growth of different guilds of microorganisms in different layers of the granule de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2005 szabó et al 2017a to complement densification there is a desire to promote energy and carbon efficient nutrient removal which could be facilitated by the low dissolved oxygen do conditions allowing simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd however there is a concern that granulation results in higher diffusion limitation resulting in reduced biological activity undermining the capacity improvements of good settling sludge strubbe et al 2022 consequently the low do conditions needed for snd might result in lower nitrification capacity for example the apparent oxygen half saturation ko2 higher diffusion limitation causes higher ko2 of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob drive the required do levels at a given solids retention time srt and temperature thus the higher the ko2 the higher the required do levels needed which limits the much desired snd nitrifiers have been shown to adapt to low do park and noguera 2004 liu and wang 2013 keene et al 2017 which translates to lower ko2 based on the literature ko2 varies as it may be affected by advection diffusion and guilds of different aob and nob manser et al 2005 arnaldos et al 2015 in granular sludge systems the interplay of ko2 and redox conditions within the granule can lead to the selection of microorganisms that are capable of nitrogen and phosphorus removal moreover denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dpaos can reduce carbon and oxygen requirements kuba et al 1996 since polyhydroxyalkanoates pha are stored by paos in anaerobic conditions and used as an internal reservoir for snd under aerobic conditions in this study we show for the first time that the implementation of hydrocyclone based wasting and continuous low do ammonia vs nox avn control at a full scale bnr facility furthermore the results show that densification is compatible with efficient low do nutrient removal without compromising nitrification capacity or the overall intensification of the process selective retention of slower growing nitrifiers and paos in the granules seems to hold the key for such performance 2 materials

stream and the underflow is returned to the activated sludge process advanced aeration control avn control was applied as described in regmi et al 2016 this study was the first ever full scale implementation of continuous avn control based on fluctuating do levels which is different than the intermittent avn as described by regmi et al 2014 based on fluctuating aerobic and anoxic times with

nitrogen and phosphorus species using hach tnt kits do ph and temperature values were recorded directly in the biological basins settling particle characterization and solids retention time to study the impact of the hydrocyclones on the mixed liquor characteristics settling and sieve analysis were performed sieve analysis was performed according to van loosdrecht et al 2016 to determine the impact of the hydrocyclones on the floc size distribution of the mixed liquor for this study the particles and aggregates that were retained in the sieve with size larger than 200 μm were defined as granules and those that passed the sieve 200 µm were considered flocs sludge volume index svi 30 min settling time for the overflow underflow and mixed liquor samples were performed according to methods outlined in standard method 2710d apha 2017 solids retention time srt in days is equal to the mass of mlss in the bnr reactors kg divided by the mass of solids wasted each day kg day the floc srt is calculated as the biomass inventory less than 200 µm in the mlss numerator divided by the mass of solids wasted less than 200 µm in the overflow plus the mass of effluent tss denominator the granule srt is calculated as the biomass inventory greater than 200 µm in the mlss numerator divided by the mass of solids wasted greater than 200 µm in the overflow denominator as the presence of granules in the effluent was assumed to be insignificant batch activity assays to measure maximum aob and nob activity rates 4 l mixed liquor samples were collected from the ras and aerated for 30 min

p release test 4 l ras sample was gently stirred and aerated for 30 min to maintain enough alkalinity 1 g of bicarbonate was added at the beginning of the test then 4 l of primary effluent sample was

c1000 cfx96 real time pcr system bio rad hercules ca usa extracellular polymeric substances a heat extraction method li and yang 2007 was used to extract the loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps from the mixed liquor samples a sludge suspension was first dewatered by centrifugation in a 50 ml tube at 4000 g for 5 min the centrate liquor was recovered for water quality analysis the sludge pellet in the tube was then resuspended into 15 ml of 0 05 nacl solution that had a similar salinity to the solution in the as reactor the sludge mixture was then diluted with the nacl solution to its original volume of 50 ml the nacl solution for dilution was pre heated to 70 c to ensure that the sludge suspension reached an immediate warm temperature of 50 c without any delay the sludge suspension was then sheared by a vortex mixer for 1 min followed by centrifugation at 4000 g for 10 min the organic matter in the supernatant was readily extractable eps and was cataloged as the lb eps of the biomass for the extraction of the tb eps the sludge pellets left in the centrifuge tubes were resuspended in 0 05 nacl solution to its original volume of 50 ml the sludge suspension was heated to 60 c in a water bath for 30 min and the sludge mixture was then centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 min the supernatant that was collected was cataloged as the tb eps both the lb eps and tb eps extractions were analyzed for total cod 3 results and discussion key results are presented for three time periods 1 before hydrocylones were installed from january 1 2019 to may 31 2019 2 during implementation of the hydrocyclones and avn control from june 1 2019 to july 1 2019 and 3 after operation of hydrocylones and avn control from july 1 2019 to march 20 2020 data are presented to demonstrate improvements in sludge quality and densification achieved using the external selector hydrocyclone based wasting and low do for carbon and energy efficient nutrient removal avn control finally srt uncoupling was estimated to understand process stability and resilience improvements by recovering slow growing desired organisms like phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and nitrifiers 3 1 sludge densification sludge volume index historical svi data for the jr wrf is summarized in table 1 the data represents different periods and conditions experienced over the past four years of operation at the plant historically the mixed liquor svi has been variable with common bulking episodes that have increased the svi to values as high as 400 ml g during the start up of the bnr plant 2016 2017 the svi averaged 150 ml g during this period the average f m in the anaerobic selector averaged 2 0 0 9 gcod gvss the high svis were caused primarily by the prevalence of microthrix parvicella during cold conditions to improve the svi poly aluminum chloride pacl was added in 2018 which resulted in a reduction of svi to 114 35 ml g to reduce the pacl addition and the costs associated with the chemical addition for svi control technologies were explored to densify the mixed liquor as a result the hydrocyclone technology was implemented and started up in june 2019 the approach for using the hydrocyclone was to waste and lower the srt of the less dense organisms including filaments through a process of deselection and to retain denser and granular organisms at a higher operating srt the svi values from january 2019 to may 2019 prior to use of the hydrocyclone were typical of bulking sludges with significant variability with values ranging between 128 and 316 ml g and an overall average value of approximately 200 ml g fig 1 after the implementation of the hydrocyclones there was a drastic improvement in svi as the 50th percentile svi dropped to 90 ml g the f m ratio before and after the implementation of hydrocyclones were the same data not shown indicating there were no changes to the overall substrate selection pressures svi improvement was immediately observed within two weeks of hydrocyclone operation as svi values decreased from 160 ml g to 85 ml g historically jd wrf suffered from poor settling in the winter months the average svi from january 2019 to march 2019 was 230 ml g in contrast the svi values for the same period in 2020 with the hydrocyclone averaged 104 ml g as more granules are formed the svi5 svi obtained after 5 min settling gets closer to the svi svi obtained after 30 min of settling the presence of bigger granules can be seen in the underflow in fig s3 therefore the ratio of svi svi5 is an intermediate indicator to examine the initial granulation in a combined granule floc system the rapid improvement in svi was marked by the initial more rapid decrease of svi5 relative to svi thus increasing the ratio of svi svi5 as it got as high as 0 8 after the operation of hydrocyclones fig 1 after that the svi improved and the svi svi5 ratio stabilized at 0 6 for combined granule floc systems moreover the hydrocyclone provides uncoupling of srt such that the granular fraction of the densified biomass had 2 times the srt of the flocculent fraction table 1 this uncoupling of srt provided by the hydrocyclone eventually led to better settling characteristics of the overall biomass as flocculent particles were wasted more aggressively fig 2 a shows the svi values increased steadily from november 2019 to january 2020 and then decreased to an average of 95 ml g from february to april 2020 considering there were no major process changes the increased srt as a response to lower wastewater temperature seemed to be the main factor that impacted svi fig 2a as the srt was increased the mass wasting from the system was reduced hence less biomass was exposed to the deselection offered by the hydrocyclones and more of the lighter less dense particles were retained in the system which negatively impacted the settling characteristics fig 2b shows the impact of srt on svi the longer srt means less exposure of the biomass to the deselection associated with the hydrocyclone reducing the overall deselection pressure consequently the increase in srt during the onset of fall resulted in higher svi sieve analysis the results were aggregated into tss greater than 200 μm to demonstrate the selection of particle sizes with hydrocyclone operation the trends of tss greater than 200 μm for hydrocyclone fractions are shown in fig 3 a as expected the greater the fraction of 200 μm particles the lower the svi and better settleability during january 2020 the svi of the underflow was as high as 97 ml g however the tss fraction greater than 200 μm remained above 57 which indicated there was not a significant loss of denser particles during this time subsequently it also suggested that as the lighter particles are wasted gradually and the sludge inventory decreases the svi improves which was seen by the improvements in svi after february fig 3a the data shows that with hydrocyclone operation 52 of the particles in mlss were greater than 200 μm while 40 and 70 of the overflow and underflow respectively were greater than 200 μm fig 3b this clearly demonstrates that larger particles are retained in the underflow of the hydrocyclone extracellular polymeric substance with the use of hydrocyclones densified biological flocs and aerobic granules accumulate in the system key differences between ordinary biological flocs densified biological flocs and aerobic granules are their size and the content of eps mcswain et al 2005 in this study a rapid increase in tb eps was observed after the hydrocyclones were commissioned it increased from 200 to 500 mgcod gvss within one month of operation fig 4 a during this time there was a significant improvement in settling characteristics svi decreased by 100 ml g while tss 200 µm increased the eps content remained relatively constant around 500 mg cod gvss over a ten month period shown in fig 4a which also spans winter operation the stability of the particles greater than 200 µm can be attributed to the high tb eps content lb eps on the other hand decreased as the particle size distribution increased lower ranges of lb eps coincided with higher tss 200 µm and vice versa fig 4b the total eps tb plus lb eps production has been shown to be a function of the substrate utilization rate jimenez et al 2015 in this study the average f m in the anaerobic selector averaged 2 0 0 9 gcod gvss before and after implementation of the hydrocyclones which is above the design guidance for anaerobic selectors of 1 5 kg total cod kgmlss d water environment federation 2018 the substrate profile was already present to create a selector zone of high substrate uptake and the implementation of the hydrocyclone selectively recycled dense particles to this zone the data indicates that the anaerobic selector and the hydocyclone together resulted in a rapid increase in tb eps production and sludge densification these observations are consistent with the observed increase of eps content up to 300 mg cod gvss in a full scale installation with anaerobic selectors which also reported low svis of 80 ml g jimenez et al 2020 3 2 nutrient removal phosphorus removal the primary mechanism of phosphorus p removal at jd wrf is enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr to overcome the carbon limitation especially vfa of the primary effluent acetic acid was historically added to the anaerobic zone to promote the growth of pao despite this addition of acetic acid the ebpr performance at jd wrf was inconsistent and did not meet the effluent tp limit of 1 mgp l reliably the ebpr performance with hydrocyclone is seen for the effluent trends in fig 5 a starting in june of 2019 after three months of hydrocyclone operation the variability of effluent tp was significantly reduced and the concentration remained below 1 0 mg p l consistently historically ebpr has been more inconsistent during the winter months december march and in addition to supplemental carbon acetic acid chemical p removal was needed using pacl the combination of hydrocyclone and avn control proved effective in maintaining stable ebpr performance during winter months without the addition of pacl and acetic acid compared to the previous year fig 5b the denser more desirable fraction in the underflow is returned to the activated sludge process by the hydrocyclone and operates at a higher solids residence time since pao containing storage products such as polyphosphate and counterions are likely denser compared to other floc forming organisms schuler et al 2002 they are retained in the system and are typically used to form the core of denser granules resulting in selection pressure that highly is favorable for ebpr to gain further insights into factors affecting ebpr stability and reliability several ex situ phosphate release and uptake batch tests pru were conducted besides to assess pao activity anoxic phosphorus uptake tests were conducted these tests were performed without the addition of external carbon carbon source was provided in the form of primary effluent the trend of pru test results reveals the pao maintained a high degree of activity which was crucial for the observed ebpr performance fig 6 a the average specific p release rate was 5 2 mgp gvss hr while the average p uptake rate was 9 4 mgp gvss hr this resulted in a ratio of p release p uptake of 0 55 which is much lower than 1 6 to 5 0 reported by onnis hayden et al 2020 the retention and enrichment of paos and lower influent p 5 mgp l resulting in lower intracellular p may have attributed to lower p release rates compared to the uptake rates in this study to test the impact of low do on the p uptake two pru tests were conducted at 0 2 mgo2 l the average specific p uptake rate for these two tests was 9 6 mgp gvss hr demonstrating that lower operating do did not impact p uptake for the entire experimental period the in basin do was below 0 4 mgo2 l therefore aeration savings associated with low do operation did not carry the penalty of reducing ebpr performance the ex situ anoxic p uptake test suggested the presence of dpao activity contributing to combined n and p removal within the bnr configuration fig 6b the anoxic p uptake was on average 36 of the aerobic p uptake the carbon utilized by dpao has two fold benefits nitrogen is removed in the anoxic zone as well as decreases the carbon entering the aerated zone thus reducing oxygen energy consumption associated with aerobic oxidation of carbon the more stable ebpr performance after hydrocyclone implementation could be attributed to dpao activity at jd wrf it is also important note that acetic acid addition discontinued prior to the study a much lower anoxic p uptake around 19 of the aerobic p uptake has been reported in a similar process configuration without the hydrocyclones and a higher 49 with a process configuration also with hydrocyclones wrf 2019 although dpao activity was not evaluated in underflow relative to overflow the relationship of higher density with pao presence by schuler et al 2002 suggests that anoxic srt limited dpao could increase with srt uncoupling nitrogen removal the 50th percentile effluent tin was 11 mgn l which is well below the effluent limit of 15 mgn l on an annual average basis before the avn control was implemented the effluent tin was 15 20 mgn l data not shown despite the variability the 90th percentile effluent tin was 15 2 mgn l which indicates that the process optimized with hydrocyclone and avn control was fully capable of meeting effluent nitrogen requirements at jd wrf this is even more significant considering that both ebpr and nitrogen removal were being sustained despite the limited carbon availability in the primary effluent c n ratio 6 0 1 6 thus the tin removal efficiency is a good indicator of nitrogen removal performance by the bnr process at jd wrf the tin removal has seen some variability due to seasonal and process changes some were related to the fine tuning of avn control as seen in fig 7 a the 50th percentile tin removal performance was 76 which is slightly lower than 78 which was observed in the early part of 2019 before hydrocyclone and avn control implementation the average effluent ammonia concentration was 2 6 mgn l while the effluent nox n nitrate nitrite concentration was 9 1 mgn l after the implementation of avn control starting at the first week of july in 2019 the reason for this deviation was due to the limitation of the aeration system lower limit of aeration blower turndown which did not allow the biological process to operate below the do of 0 2 mgo2 l consequently optimal levels of denitrification were not realized during low ammonia loading conditions which contributed to higher effluent tin levels to gain further insights into factors affecting nitrification performance several ex situ specific nitrification rate snr batch tests were conducted the test involved aerating the mixed liquor sample 4 mg o2 l while providing a high starting ammonia concentration 25 mgnh4 n l and addition of alkalinity to maintain neutral ph the main objective was to assess the activity of aob to convert ammonia to nitrite first step and nob to convert nitrite to nitrate second step of nitrification the batch test involves aeration over time 2 h where the production of nitrite and nitrate as well as ammonia is monitored the trends of a specific activity in mgn gvss hr of aob and nob are presented in fig 7b the specific activity of aob averaged 4 1 mgn gvss hr while the average specific activity of nob was also 4 14 mgn gvss hr this suggests a healthy population of nitrifiers and there was no inhibition of nitrification at jd wrf in fact the specific nitrification rates are comparable to srt uncoupled hybrid biofilm based processes using flocs and mbbr regmi et al 2011 aobmedia 4 97 mgn gmlss hr aobsuspended 1 72 mgn gmlss hr and were supported by the 1 2 srtfloc srtgranule uncoupling also seen here in a floc and granule process table 1 since the specific activity of aob and nob were essentially very close fig 7b it can be concluded that there was no nob out selection therefore nitrogen removal via nitrite nitrite shunt did not occur and the carbon savings associated with this shortcut pathway was not realized the aeration basin do levels were being managed by the avn control system starting july 1 2019 the avn control drove do to very low levels and avoided over aeration while maintaining required nitrification the distribution of do levels clearly indicates that at jd wrf nitrification is occurring at low oxygen conditions as a result avn control the plant can maintain consistently low do levels the 50th percentile do is 0 26 mg o2 l fig 8 a suggesting that the nitrifier population or the adapted morphology is well adapted in these low do conditions the trends of do is presented in figure s3 the major advantage of low do operation translated into significant aeration savings at jd wrf under the normal operation of maintaining do 2 mg o2 l jd wrf needed to use two aeration blowers 8374 nm3 h each however with reduced aeration demand under the avn control only one aeration blower was sufficient and oversized during low loading periods the 90th percentile total airflow was 7728 nm3 h which is less than the capacity of the single blower therefore by not operating one extra blower the plant has accrued significant aeration energy savings 50 the low do adaptation of the nitrifiers is further substantiated by the molecular results suggesting the dominant presence of nitropsira species of nob functioning as complete ammonia oxidizers comammox roots et al 2019 as shown in fig 8b relative to conventional aob population temporal variation of comammox amoa nxrb and pao during the study is provided in fig s4 further the adaptation of nitrifier or morphology to low do conditions was clearly demonstrated by the fact that at do of 0 2 mg o2 l and 0 8 mg o2 l the specific nitrification rates were 50 and 93 respectively compared to the test conducted at 4 mg o2 l fig 9 a besides there was also evidence that the hydrocyclone could be retaining nitrifiers in the underflow compared to what is wasted in the overflow fig 9b shows that the specific nitrification rate in the underflow was 30 higher than in the overflow therefore the slower growing nitrifiers were being retained in the granules and experiencing longer srt 2 times more srt than the flocculent biomass compared to less desirable organisms that were selectively wasted in the overflow this srt uncoupling confers extra process capacity safety factor and thereby provides process stability and resilience the low do adaptation coupled with selective retention of nitrifiers by the hydrocyclone leveraged avn control to drive the do levels low and help realize significant aeration savings 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrated energy and carbon efficient nutrient removal with the following conclusions intensification settling improved dramatically within weeks of the hydrocyclone start up svi values decreased from approximately 200 ml g to 90 ml g on average after start up historical filament problems improved and the plant has eliminated the usage of chemical settling aids previously required especially during winter months improved svi allows for an increase in process capacity by supporting higher mlss or lower first order do concentration process resilience the srt of granules and flocs were uncoupled with a 2 granule to 1 floc ratio supporting an uncoupled srt ratio of also 2 1 as calculated with the srt formula batch activity test results suggest excellent ebpr supporting that the hydrocyclone helped uncouple to preferentially select dense paos and anoxic srt limited dpaos thus increasing process resilience similarly slower growing nitrifiers were retained in the underflow of the hydrocyclone in excess of wasted overflow low average do 0 3 mgo2 l maintained by the avn control suggested no nitrification capacity limitation with granulation carbon and energy efficiency efficient n removal with tn 11 mgn l and tp 1 mgp l was maintained at cod n ratio of 6 1 without adding external chemicals batch activity tests shown an enrichment of low do adapted nitrifiers presence of comammox yielding high nitrification rates consequently avn control has maintained low do conditions resulting in significant aeration savings for
