16985,methane is a type of renewable fuel that can generate many types of high value added chemicals however besides heat and power production there is little methane utilization in most of the wastewater treatment plants wwtps all round the world currently in this review the status of methane production performance from wwtps was firstly investigated subsequently based on the identification and classification of methane oxidizing bacteria mob the key enzymes and metabolic pathway of mob were presented in depth then the production extraction and purification process of high value added chemicals including methanol ectoine biofuel bioplastic methane protein and extracellular polysaccharides were introduced in detail which was conducive to understand the bioconversion process of methane finally the use of methane in wastewater treatment process including nitrogen removal emerging contaminants removal as well as resource recovery was extensively explored these findings could provide guidance in the development of sustainable economy and environment and facilitate biological methane conversion by using mob in further attempts graphical abstract image graphical abstract

structure and high degree of tetrahedral symmetry methane is the final product from the anaerobic treatment of contaminants methane is the colorless and odorless greenhouse gas and accounts for 22 of total persistent greenhouse gases lelieveld et al 1998 in the atmosphere which becomes a major concern to global climate change due to the methane emission from biological activities atmospheric concentration of methane tellingly increased at a rate of 1 per year cicerone and oremland 1988 research shows that the amount of methane that contributed by microorganisms in the atmosphere is more than 350 tg every year conrad 2009 therefore developing techniques for upgrading the value of methane is highly urgent however besides heat and power generation by combustion methane is extraordinarily difficult to be utilized under mild conditions the methane conversion ratio ranged from 3 50 was achieved by chemical catalysis at relatively higher temperature and pressure circumstance while more operation cost was required as mo hg or even au were used as the catalysts lee et al 2016 in recent 15 years methane oxidizing bacteria mob was discovered as a type of microorganism that was able to reduce atmospheric methane and mitigate global warming gupta et al 2013 reeburgh 2007 more than 60 of methane bioconversion ratio by methylosinus trichosporium ob3b facilitates the utilization of methane resources lee et al 2016 and the high production of value added chemicals and high bioconversion of methane can be further desired especially when micro bubble and nano bubble aeration techniques was employed the present review summarizes the current status and potential risks on methane in wwtps with an emphasis on the identification classification and performance of methane monooxygenase mmo and mob and the bioconversion of methane for high value added chemicals production by mob was highlighted in addition the use of mob in nitrogen removal resource recovery and emerging contaminants removal was investigated to provide extensive applications of methane in wastewater treatment process based on carbon neutral 2 methane and wastewater treatment plants wwtps 2 1 production of methane in wwtps wwtps have been considered as the relatively strong yet poorly constrained sources of atmospheric greenhouse gas where methane carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide were the principal components mannina et al 2018 however the contribution of methane emissions to the greenhouse gas footprint were slightly higher than the carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions the methane emissions daelman et al 2012 for wastewater treatment increased to 2892 thousand tons in 2012 and also took a larger share 5 17 of total methane emissions zhao et al 2019 methane is the final product in anaerobic wastewater and sludge treatment processes approximately 86 4 of methane emissions were derived from anaerobic treatment tanks in wwtps masuda et al 2015 which could be subsequently released to the atmosphere by intensive mechanical aeration and surface diffusion in addition methane formation in sewer systems was found to be a new pathway of methane emission in wastewater treatment processes and the production of methane is positively correlated with the hydraulic retention time of wastewater guisasola et al 2008 anaerobic organics decomposition processes in sewer systems led to substantial methane release from liquid phase in pump station by water turbulence and in aerated grit chambers by intensive mechanical aeration wang et al wang et al 2011 studied that large quantities of methane could be generated and emit under both anaerobic and aerobic steps in full scale anaerobic anoxic aerobic aao wastewater treatment process due to the low dissolved oxygen do concentration and the most significant factors influencing ch4 methane emissions were do content in aerated grit chamber and oxic tank and wastewater temperature in high density settler tanks additionally the presence of nitrite and nitrate were discovered that could effectively inhibit methane formation in anaerobic wastewater treatment process and the inhibition threshold of nitrite and nitrate were 8 0 and 0 07 mg l respectively banihani et al 2009 jiang et al 2010 the specific methane production rate from sludge buffer tank and sludge storage tank were 3 5 g ch4 kgtss digested sludge d and 1 0 ch4 kgtss dewatered sludge d respectively while the specific methane production rate was at the peak value of 9 0 g ch4 kgtss digested sludge d in anaerobic digestion ad tank daelman et al 2012 therefore 75 of methane emission originated from ad process which the establishment of ad facilities should be taken into consideration when determining the methane footprint of wwtps conversely 80 of the methane diffusing to the activated sludge process was gradually oxidized daelman et al 2012 due to the good handling of ventilation air consequently the installation of ventilation could be adopted as a strategy to further reduce methane emissions from wastewater treatment process in addition an interesting investigation presented that the maximum methane flux occurred at the export of sludge screw conveyor wang et al 2011 after sludge centrifugal dewatering process which was 823 g m2 d the possible reason could be attributed to the formation condition and diffusion of methane because large amounts of methane is produced owing to the relatively high ambient temperature and anoxic conditions within the centrifugal equipment then methane diffuses along with the transport of dewatered sludge and finally emits to atmosphere from the export of sludge screw conveyor daelman et al 2012 filho 2005 2 2 dissolved methane the influent of wwtp contains dissolved methane is primarily formed in the sewer system daelman et al 2012 50 of methane produced from anaerobic processes remains dissolved within the effluent that discharged from the anaerobic treatment reactor and further resulted in large dissolved methane emission rates and export rates from effluents liu et al 2014 it was found that the methane flux from oxic tanks was relatively high yet the dissolved methane content was the lowest the possible reason could be attributed to the sufficient aeration which was able to strip most of the dissolved methane from the wastewater daelman et al 2012 in addition the content of dissolved methane in the influent pump station and aerated grit chambers were discovered much higher than that in other wastewater treatment facilities effluent methane concentration was linearly related to the organic loading rate of the wastewater regnier et al 2013 and the production of methane mainly depends on the amount of degradable organic components in the wastewater zhao et al 2019 however there was no significant correlation between effluent dissolved methane and influent chemical oxygen demand cod and the linear equation of effluent dissolved methane μmol l and influent cod μmol l can be briefly described as zhao et al 2019 deff ch4 2 37 10 5cod 0 09 dissolved methane that leaves the anaerobic treatment tanks including digester the gravitational thickener for the primary sludge the sludge thickeners as well as centrifuge for sludge dewatering will be either introduced to the downstream processing facilities or to the influent pump station and aeration tanks and most of the dissolved methane can be effectively oxidized by the activated sludge daelman et al 2012 the average methane emission was estimated to be 266 227 mg ch4 yr and 0 02 of the total estimated methane emission was exported in dissolved form within the effluent alshboul et al 2016 however alshboul et al alshboul et al 2016 demonstrated that the content of dissolved methane and carbon dioxide were enhanced and the atmospheric fluxes of both gases increased by factors of 1 2 and 8 6 when effluent was discharged to the receiving streamwater thus the likely environmental risks to the surrounding aquatic ecosystems should not be avoided 2 3 emission of methane in wwtps there is potential for mitigating methane emissions from wwtps and good regulation of do was conducive to prevent methane production wang et al 2011 however the determination of methane emission principally depend on socioeconomic factors including economic development government and technology selection zhao et al 2019 according to the investigation in 229 chinese cities the total methane emissions from wwtps amounted to 1169 8 thousand tons 2014 which took a share 83 8 of the national total methane emissions from wwtps zhao et al 2019 cities with bigger populations produce more methane from wwtps since more wastewater tend to be generated and most of these cities also demonstrated greater per capita methane emissions emission factor ef and the influent degradable organic components zhao et al 2019 mainly determined the considerable discrepancies in methane emissions in different cities and gross domestic product gdp population as well as higher water quality stress were strongly correlated with biodegradable organic components in wastewater which could further influence methane emissions 3 methane oxidizing bacteria mob and methane monooxygenase mmo methane oxidizing bacteria is a branch of methylotrophic bacteria with methane as the principal carbon and energy source kalyuzhnaya et al 2015 which can convert methane into carbon dioxide and mitigate the greenhouse effect shindell et al 2012 and thus attracted more attention mob the first strain söhngen et al 1906 that isolated in 1906 are widely distributed in ecosystems and many studies demonstrates the characteristics of aerobic mob because the generation time is short and the pure culture is easy to obtain this type of mob can be divided into methane assimilating bacteria mab and autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aaob the mab possesses a complete pathway of methane oxidation and cellular carbon was synthesized during the methane oxidization process nunoura et al 2008 orphan et al 2002a while aaob oxidizes ammonia nitrogen to sustain the autotrophic growth and assimilates carbon dioxide to cellular carbon through calvin benson bassham cbb cycle another type of mob is a branch of methyl oxidizing bacteria which can only use methane as the carbon and energy source methanol can be produced through mmo in mob and subsequently being oxidized to formaldehyde then formaldehyde is assimilated into cell carbon or biomass and finally becomes the terminal product carbon dioxide after experiences a series of dehydrogenation reactions fig 1 conrad 1996 with the function of methane consumption mob plays an important role in mitigating global warming and further positively influence carbon oxygen and nitrogen cycles in the aquatic ecosystem hanson and hanson 1996 besides owing to the synthesis of cell carbon or biomass mob may possess great potential for the production of high value added chemicals including biofuel bioplastics methane protein as well as extracellular polysaccharides mandernack et al 2000 3 1 identification and classification of mob 3 1 1 aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria aerobic mob is gram negative bacteria that have performed commercial use potential in production practice and played a significant role in the global carbon cycle aerobic mob has been divided into three groups which the basic information was summarized in table 1 kalyuzhnaya 2016 in addition aerobic mob can be characterized into three categories based on the cell structure morphology function microbial physiology and the evolutionary relationship of the systems table 2 the first category includes type i and type x mob with a total of 10 genera which all belonging to γ proteobacteria methylococcus methylomonas methylosoma methylothermus methylobacter methylosarcina methylohalobius methylosphaera methylomicrobium and methylocaldum of which methylocaldum and methylococcus type x are able to utilize three classical carbon assimilation pathways fig 2 namely ribulose monophosphate cycle rump cycle serine cycle serine cycle and calvin cycle calvin benson bassham cbb cycle conversely the rest of the eight genera can only metabolize the rump cycle to assimilate c1 component equipped with intracellular cytoplasmic membranes icm particulate methane monooxygenase pmmo can be attached which is conducive for type i mob to utilize rump cycle supplementary figure 1 and further achieve to methane oxidation the second category is consisted of type ii mob with a total of five genera which all belonging to α proteobacteria methylosinus methylocystis methylocella methylocapsa and methyloferula these genera utilize serine cycle supplementary figure 2 for c1 component assimilation and except for methylocella the other genera do not possess intact icm structure and contain soluble methane monooxygenase smmo dedysh and dunfield 2011 hanson and hanson 1996 the third category of aerobic mob is mainly the thermophilic acidophilic bacteria belonging to verrucomicrobia the genus methylacidiphilum can firstly converts methane into carbon dioxide and subsequently utilize cbb cycle to assimilate carbon dioxide and form carboxylase vorobev et al 2013 in addition with the marked development of phospholipid compounds analysis the mob can be effectively identified and classified c16 fatty acids were dominated in type i and type x mob while type ii mob is predominantly c18 fatty acids especially 18 1ω8c and 18 1ω7c fatty acids bowman et al 1991 scheller et al 2016 3 1 2 anaerobic methane oxidizing bacteria owing to relatively long cell generation time and slow growth rate of anaerobic mob only three principal kinds of anaerobic methane oxidation processes were discovered 1 sulphate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation samo the process is completed by a symbiotic relationship which is composed of srb and anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme caldwell et al 2008 so4 2 was used as the final electron acceptor and hs and hco3 were generated along with the reduction of sulfate anme can be divided into three groups based on the phylogenetic analysis anme 1 genus methanosarcinales and methanomicrobiales anme 2 genus methanosarcinales and anme 3 genus methanococcoides niemann et al 2006 candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens belonging to the anme sub class is the only archaea that utilizes methane as the electron donor and nitrate as the electron acceptor for both methane oxidation and denitrification haroon et al 2013 and the candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera that is capable of anaerobic methane oxidation affiliated with nc10 family table 2 2 denitrification dependent anaerobic methane oxidation damo anme haroon et al 2013 and typical m oxyfera an uncultivated bacteria belonging to the nc10 family ettwig et al 2008 both metabolize methane as the electron donor and nitrite or nitrate were reduced to n2 3 fe3 dependent and mn4 dependent anaerobic methane oxidation the major microorganisms that worked in this process are ambiguous yet methane was found that could be used as the electron donor and ferric or manganese were adopted as the electron acceptors for reduction reactions norði et al 2013 3 2 methane monooxygenases mmo derived from mob mmo is a complicated macromolecular protein complex that catalyzes methane to produce methanol by the oxidation of methane c h bond methanol chan et al 2013 the movement in mmo subunits or between amino acid side chains is beneficial to the catalytic process when external driving force chemical energy is provided soluble mmo principally distributed in the cytoplasm and particulate mmo mainly distributed on the cell membrane only a small amount of mob contain both smmo and pmmo hanson and hanson 1996 murrell et al 2000 and except for methylocella all currently known aerobic mob contain pmmo dedysh et al 2000 3 2 1 soluble methane monooxygenase smmo the smmo is complex in composition and possesses a wide range of substrates including methane short chain alkanes alkenes as well as aromatics trotsenko and murrell 2008 the smmo consists of three typical proteins namely hydroxylase mmoh molecular weight of 251 kda protein b mmob molecular weight of 16 kda and reductase mmor molecular weight of 39 kda mmoh presents the dimer αβγ 2 form and equipped with three subunits α β and γ protein b is able to regulate the catalytic reaction of smmo by coupling electrons when the hydroxylation of the substrate was catalyzed in the active center of mmoh mmor contains a coenzyme fad and a double iron disulfide 2fe 2s cluster and the reducing power of the reaction is generally supplied with nad p h dalton 2005 lee et al 2013 the gene cluster size of smmo is 5 5 kb and its order is mmoxybzdc which encodes the α subunit of hydroxylase the β subunit of hydroxylase the regulatory protein b the γ subunit of hydroxylase mmod protein and reduction enzyme c hua et al 2011 trotsenko and murrell 2008 the expression of smmo gene is required at low concentrations of copper ions which acts as activator and promoter of the mmox gene supplementary figure 3 up to now there are three methane oxidation hypotheses about the mechanism of c h bond cleavage 1 c h bond homolysis formation of free radicals 2 c h bond heterolysis formation of carbanion intermediates to maintain the stability and 3 c h bond cleavage synergistic reaction of methane and fe o dalton 2005 3 2 2 particulate methane monooxygenase pmmo the pmmo is a copper containing membrane bound protein tavormina et al 2013 other than smmo pmmo possesses a relatively narrow substrate range which can only oxidize alkanes or alkenes with a carbon chain length of less than c5 due to the low enzymatic activity under air exposure dalton 2005 murrell et al 2000 when oxidizing the c h bond at the c2 position of c2 c5 from alcohol or olefin the corresponding product ethylene oxide was generated chen et al 2014 the coding gene of pmmo is transcribed at high copper ion concentrations pmmo consists of hydroxylase pmmoh and reductase pmmor the pmmoh contains three subunits α pmob β pmoa and γ pmoc with the respective molecular weight of 45 27 and 23 kda while the pmmor consists of a protein with a molecular weight of 63 and 8 kda dispirito et al 1991 murrell et al 2000 the active center of pmmo contains two metal sites 1 the double copper center at the pmob subunit and 2 the center of the variable metal site at the pmoc subunit liew et al 2014 according to the crystal structure of pmmo the metal elements in the active center may present in the three copper clusters of the pmoa subunit or the double iron clusters exist in the pmoc subunit or the triple copper cluster located in the pmob subunit bollinger 2010 affected by the content of copper ions the expression levels of different types of mmo showed that pmmo requires comparably higher copper ion content relative to smmo ho et al 2013 the oxygen binding site of pmmo is located at the double copper ion center of the soluble portion in pmob and the active site of pmmo is located in the soluble n terminal region of the pmob subunit wang and lippard 2014 therefore the c h bond was considered as the rate limiting step in hydroxylation reaction li et al 2012 however it was discovered that the threonine residue near the center of the double copper ion supplied a hydrogen atom to coordinate copper peroxide to form hydroxylated copper and oxidized copper thereby the hydroxylation of methane occurred li et al 2012 shiota et al 2013 and resulted in the controversial of methanol production from methane in the catalytic process 3 3 metabolic pathways of mob understanding the metabolic pathways of mob including cell compositions bioprocess molecular function and enzyme systems is conducive to reduce greenhouse gas emission control climate change as well as enhance contaminants removal 3 3 1 metabolic pathways of aerobic mob 3 3 1 1 methane and methanol oxidation by oxidizing methane to carbon dioxide mob can produce a series of intermediate metabolites fig 2 which is inclusive of methanol formaldehyde and formic acid the oxidation of methane is carried out by the mmo in which the alkanes cyclic hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds with up to 8 carbons can be oxidized by smmo and alkanes up to 5 carbons are able to be oxidized by pmmo burrows et al 1984 methanol is the first product of methane oxidation subsequently methanol is oxidized by methanol dehydrogenase mdh that distributed in the periplasmic space to form formaldehyde figs 1 and 3 the molecular structure and reaction mechanism of mdh have been extensively investigated in gram negative mob fig 3 anthony and williams 2003 as methanol is a high value added chemicals the gene encoding the large subunit of mdh mxaf in mob is highly conserved bastien et al 1989 mcdonald and murrell 1997 thereby the gene mxaf can be used as the functional gene for identification of mob 3 3 1 2 formaldehyde assimilation c1 component assimilation in aerobic mob can be presented not only at the formaldehyde level through the rump cycle but also at the methylene tetrahydrofolate and carbon dioxide levels through the serine cycle in addition c1 component assimilation occurs at carbon dioxide level through the cbb cycle rump cycle and serine cycle are regarded as the important pathway for type i type ii and type x mob conversely the cbb cycle is present in nc10 bacterium rasigraf et al 2014 1 rump cycle type i mob principally use the rump cycle supplementary figure 1 to assimilate formaldehyde hanson and hanson 1996 fructose 6 phosphate can be converted to pyruvate through entner doudoroff edd and embden meyerhof parnas emp pathways according to the enzyme activity pyruvate was produced from edd pathway in most of the mob however the production of pyruvate in methylomicrobium is the emp pathway based on the 13c stable isotope labeling experiments kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 in addition it has been shown that phosphohexulose synthase hps and hexoseose isomerase hpi were required to maintain the rump cycle and relatively high active hps and hpi are outstanding markers of carbon fixation through the rump cycle anthony 1975 2 serine cycle the pathway for the formaldehyde assimilation by type ii mob is the serine cycle supplementary figure 2 hanson and hanson 1996 formaldehyde produces formate by means of the tetrahydromethane pterin h4mtp pathway which is then converted to methylene tetrahydrofolate ch2 h4f by the tetrahydrofolate h4f pathway and finally enters the serine cycle fig 2 via demethyltransferase c1 component assimilation through the serine cycle requires the regeneration of glyoxylate from acetyl coa and the glyoxylate can be supplemented by emc pathway supplementary figure 2 chistoserdova et al 2009 genes are often clustered and coordinated in serine cycle kalyuzhnaya and lidstrom 2005 and the structure and function of the gene cluster are surprisingly complex the genome of m oxysporum is inclusive of many genes encoding the serine cycle but they are rarely clustered ward et al 2004 3 cbb cycle a fairly large number of mob are able to assimilate c1 component through cbb cycle and two major categories of mob were discovered namely verrucomicrobia m infernorum op den camp et al 2009 and n10 anaerobic mob m oxyfera ettwig et al 2010 the cbb cycle uses carbon dioxide as the carbon source to synthesize cellular components and subsequently generate energy for the growth of cells khadem et al 2011 in addition it is conspicuous that the transformation of carbon dioxide by the cbb cycle can not only metabolize the carbon dioxide produced by the mob genera itself but also utilize the carbon dioxide from the environment which demonstrates an important application to further reduce greenhouse effect 3 3 2 metabolic pathways of anaerobic mob 3 3 2 1 samo samo is the first methane anaerobic oxidation pathway which can be divided into three groups namely anme 1 anme 2 and anme 3 anme 1 shows relatively further relationship with m mazei while anme 2 belongs to the methanosarcina thermophila and anme 3 is a newly identified archaea group which is close to methanococcoides knittel et al 2005 lösekann et al 2007 niemann et al 2006 the symbiotic growth between anme 1 and srb is relatively loose knittel et al 2005 however a close symbiont with srb can be formed from anme 2 and anme 3 orphan et al 2002b besides methane oxidation anme 1 can grow with acetic acid propionic acid or butyric acid as well knittel et al 2005 yet the subtype of anme 2 namely anme 2d has further homology with other members of anme 2 which is not capable of oxidizing methane and cannot form a symbionts with srb orphan et al 2001 at present the methane oxidation mechanism of anme is not clear and three possible theoretical models were successively proposed namely reverse methanogenesis theory acetic acid theory and methylation theory lloyd et al 2011 found that anme 1 could use the reverse methanogenic pathway for methane oxidation under certain conditions lloyd et al 2011 3 3 2 2 damo damo has long been discovered that the methane oxidation can be coupled with denitrification in wastewater treatment process sollo et al 1976 which nitrite nitrate can be used as the final electron acceptor islas lima et al 2004 islas lima et al 2004 introduced methane into the wastewater with relatively high nitrite nitrate concentration under anoxic conditions and discovered that both nitrite nitrate and methane can be effectively removed the results from hu et al hu et al 2009 hu et al 2011 showed that relatively high temperature was conducive to the growth of archaea but low temperature led to the elimination of archaea candidatus m oxyfera is in favor of growing with nitrite as the substrate while when nitrate is used as the substrate the dominant genus was archaea associated with anme other than candidatus m oxyfera in addition the microbial activity of candidatus m oxyfera will be significantly inhibited when the concentration of nitrite exceeds 1 mmol l the latest research on candidatus m oxyfera demonstrates that the methane oxidation pathway by candidatus m oxyfera is completely different from the mob that have been discovered a new pathway named intra aerobic denitrification for the oxidation of methane the shape of the cell was polygonal wu et al 2012 and presented no endomembrane structure hanson and hanson 1996 but possessed an outer sheath proteins luesken et al 2011 luesken et al 2011 found that the presence of nc10 bacteria similar to candidatus m oxyfera was detected in 9 wastewater treatment plants in netherlands and effective nitrogen removal and methane anaerobic oxidation can be both obtained the growth rate of candidatus m oxyfera becomes slow when excess oxygen existed in the biological tank of wwtps and the bioactivity will be further inhibited and can not be recovered even oxygen is consumed luesken et al 2012 3 3 2 3 ferric manganese as the final electron acceptor fe3 and mn4 can also be the final electron acceptor associated with methane oxidation under anaerobic conditions beal et al 2009 and anme 1 and anme 3 involved in the process it can be speculated that due to the huge flux of ferric and manganese discharged from wwtps to the river each year the contribution of the above process to anaerobic methane oxidation may be noteworthy additionally since the research on the process was recently discovered consequently the identification of strains the conditions of the process and the microbiological mechanism of its effects need to be further investigated 4 bioconversion of methane for high value added chemicals production by the use of methane as the raw material to produce chemicals via microbial fermentation or refining can not only obtain the aims of methane emission reduction greenhouse effect mitigation but also can synthesize high value added products which is significant to alleviate energy crises and achieve resource recovery the high value added chemicals produced by mob can be used as the renewable substitutes including methanol ectoine biofuel bioplastics methane proteins and extracellular polysaccharides table 3 4 1 methanol methanol is generally utilized as the external carbon source to enhance nitrogen and phosphorus removal or in the synthesis of industrial compounds including acetic acid ethanol olefins formaldehyde methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and dimethyl ether dme if no mdh inhibition method was employed ethylene and propylene can be produced from the methanol to olefin mto process which can be further used as the hydrocarbon and organic polymeric materials fig 4 bjorck et al 2018 4 1 1 methanol production by mdh inhibition the basic information of mob that carried out bioconversion from methane to methanol was listed in table 4 the presence of mmo in mob can catalyze the production of methanol from methane and the mdh can oxidize methanol to formaldehyde and finally form carbon dioxide and produce a large amount of nadh fig 3 metal chelating agents benzoquinone high concentration phosphates iodoacetic acid dithiothreitol and glycidol all perform the inhibition effect of mdh thus improving methanol yield carver et al 1984 furuto et al 1999 furuto et al 1999 adopted methanol propanol to inhibit the bioactivity of mtrichos porium ob3b for enhancing methanol production and resulting in a methanol concentration of 6 mmol l thereafter although the accumulation of methanol was achieved by the inhibition of mdh the highest accumulation of methanol concentration was lower than 12 mmol l due to the poor harvesting technique when mob are used to catalyze methane oxidation to methanol the exogenous electron donor must be provided to proceed the methanol production process therefore it can be predicted that the selection of exogenous electron donors will become a hot spot to enhance methanol bioconversion strong et al 2015 4 1 2 methanol production by operation optimization except for the dosage of exogenous electron the operation optimization for good methanol production were extensively studied and the methanol content can reach 2 mmol l based on the optimization of the culture conditions by optimizing the culture conditions the methanol concentration of methylosinustrichosporium ob3b reached the peak value of 152 mmol mg dcw after 100 h of culture with the methanol conversion rate of 61 takeguchi et al 1997 when applied the high density cell culture method in a membrane ventilated bioreactor the concentration of methanol was up to 1 1 g l after 50 h duan et al 2011 in addition the methane and cu 2 concentration cell culture time immobilization of cells as well as exogenous electron donor play important roles in the accumulation of methanol and the existence of carbon dioxide in the culture medium can effectively inhibit the methanol metabolism xin et al 2004 4 2 ectoine 4 2 1 structure and characteristics of ectoine 1 4 5 6 tetrahydro 2 methyl 4 pyrimidinecarboxylic acid ectoine was first identified in ectothiorhodospira halochloris at 1985 with the molecular formula of c6h10n2o2 molecular weight of 142 2 g mol supplementary figure 4 galinski et al 1985 ectoine is an osmotic compensatory solute synthesized by certain microorganisms in response to high osmotic stress with high water soluble no electrostatic charge in the physiological ph range and active groups ectoine can be highly accumulated in cells for further extraction ectoine possesses important commercial use value in the fields of cell protectants biological stabilizers cosmetics and pharmaceutical preparations additionally the presence of ectoine is conducive to the biofilms or cells including protein and nucleic acids to withstand adverse conditions galinski and trüper 1994 pastor et al 2010 4 2 2 synthetic pathway of ectoine halomonas elongate which belonged to the genus methylomicrobium methylobacter and methylohalobius is able to produce ectoine both in batch and continuous bioreactors the biosynthesis of ectoine is a branching pathway of the aspartic acid family in the microbial metabolic network the intermediate metabolite oxaloacetate from the tca cycle produces l aspartic acid under the action of aspartate aminotransferase ast then l aspartic acid is converted to l aspartic acid phosphate by the action of aspartokinase ask and further converted into l aspartic acid phosphate semialdehyde by the action of l aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase asd according to the bioconversion process mentioned above three enzymes l 2 4 diaminobutyric acid acetyltransferase diaminobutyrate 2 oxoglutarate transaminase and ectoine dioxygenase encoded by three genes ecta ectb ectc regulate the synthesis of ectoine fig 5 cánovas et al 1998 it was discovered that the halophilic methanotrophs and methylotrophs both isolated and identified from genus methylomicrobium were able to accumulate ectoine at a level of 0 2 g g dcw and the flora may be reused for nine times which the final average yield of ectoine is as high as 0 155 g g dcw sauer and galinski 1998 strong et al 2015 4 2 3 extraction and purification of ectoine ectoine is a small and hydrophilic biomolecule and is also soluble in organic solvents according to the hypotonic impact method the intracellular ectoine can be extracted and further purified by ion exchange concentration and crystallization onraedt et al 2005 adopted organic solvent extraction method to recover ectoine from cells in ethanol the ethanol enriched in ectoine was finally dosed to the viscous residue in the mass ratio of 3 1 and obtained 66 of the ectoine after four times crystallization onraedt et al 2005 in addition ectoine can also be collected by aqueous phase extraction since ectoine is able to be released into the water phase and 75 99 of high purity of ectoine can be obtained after ion exchange and crystallization ono et al 1999 4 3 biofuel 4 3 1 short chain fatty acids scfas production the shortage of crude oil can be forecasted in the near future therefore methane with vast reserve and extensive source attracts more attention through the microbial conversion process scfas including acetate propionate butyrate valerate as well as caproate are the principal terminal products in the methane bioconversion process anaerobic mob methanoperedens nitroreducens is able to effectively produce the common substrate acetate when nitrite nitrate is given as the electron acceptor cai et al 2018 scfas production rate reach the peak value of 120 g l d due to the high flux of methane was introduced through the hollow fiber membrane chen et al 2018 and relatively low oxygen supply rate was in favor of scfas production and carbon utilization chen et al 2019 4 3 2 lipid production and extraction from mob the production of biofuel directly from methane is a promising approach fig 6 by the use of mob the pmmo in mob will highly expressed when mob grow in the presence of cu2 and subsequently the lipid containing intracellular membrane is highly synthesized and becomes the main component of biomass peltola et al 1993 in order to increase the lipid yield and further convert them to biofuel the fast growing and lipid rich methylomicrobium buryatense 5gb1 and its glycogen knockout mutant ap18 were studied to increase the lipid content of the cell inner membrane and the biofuel yield the highest cell weight was up to 21 4 g l and the maximum lipid productivity was 45 4 mg l h when high cell density cultures with continuous feeds of methane and oxygen were employed in addition the lipid content increased by 90 through limiting the biosynthesis of glycogen in strain ap18 fei et al 2018 although phospholipids are not broadly considered as a good feedstock for the upgradation of hydrocarbon fuels combined with advanced catalyst designs and novel lipid extraction methods two stage pretreatment is adopted and the product can recover as high as 95 of total fatty acids from membrane bound phospholipids the lipid conversion efficiency is over 99 and the final hydrocarbon mixture is on the basis of 88 of pentadecane c15h32 from decarbonylation decarboxylation and hydrogenation of c16 fatty acids indicating that the bioconversion of methane to liquid fuel process is technically feasible and practical 4 3 3 mass transfer improvement to improve the mass transfer efficiency of the substrate the mob m trichosporium ob3b was used and the paraffin oil was added as the methane transporter to enhance the mass transfer of methane to mob cells the cell density was the largest and the cell growth rate was the fastest when the concentration of paraffin oil ranged from 4 to 6 han et al 2009 after the mob fermentation is terminated the dry weight of the cells is higher than 9 89 g l which is 4 5 times higher than the control group the possible reason may be attributed to the addition of paraffin oil leads to the emulsification of the cell culture and change the hydrodynamic properties of the fluids and in turn increase the solution viscosity and enhance the mass transfer of methane additionally the mob cells tend to accumulate at the interface between water and paraffin oil due to the interaction between mob cells and paraffin oil therefore the presence of paraffin oil is conducive to transfer methane to the cells and further accelerate the methane oxidation rate of mob 4 4 bioplastics mob metabolize methane to form formaldehyde and formaldehyde in turn enters the anabolic pathway and synthesize it into acetyl coa fig 7 which is further converted into the polymer substance polyhydroxybutyrate phb and finally conserved in microbial cells phb is a type of polyhydroxyalkanoate pha at present with different monomer structures more than 100 types of phas polymer linear polyester have been studied and identified of which the phb is the earliest and most explored type 4 4 1 structure and characteristics of pha based on the chain length of the constituent monomers pha is divided into three types namely short chain length pha the monomer contains 3 to 5 carbon atoms medium chain length pha the monomer contains 6 to 16 carbon atoms and short and medium chain length copolymerized pha formed by copolymerization of short chain and medium chain monomers hazer and steinbüchel 2007 nomura et al 2008 pha with a variety of monomer types is a kind of biodegradable polymer that possesses similar physical and mechanical properties and good processing properties as traditional plastics due to the differences of chain length and side chain groups pha possesses a diverse material science property in addition being capable of degrading pha to monomer methane carbon dioxide and water pha degrading enzymes can be synthesized in many microorganisms 4 4 2 synthesis of phb in mob it is discovered that only 12 types of mob from 6 genus possess phb accumulation function the dominant type ii strain producing phb can be screened by limiting nitrogen source and methane in the culture medium pieja et al 2012 mob synthesize pha generally through the acetyl coa pathway in which acetyl coa enters the tca cycle and synthesizes various intermediate metabolites to maintain the bioactivity of mob cells under nutrient equilibrium growth conditions however under nutrient limiting condition two acetyl coa molecules are condensed to form acetyl coa by the catalysis of enzyme phaa and then reduced to the precursor substance of phb r 3 hydroxybutyryl coa via the activation of enzyme phab nadph dependent acetyl coa reductase finally enzyme phac pha polymerase promotes the polymerization of phb to pha peoples and sinskey 1989a b likewise under the nutrient limiting condition the rump pathway and the serine pathway supplementary figures 1 and 2 cannot proceed smoothly and the intermediate metabolites enter the phb synthetic pathway pieja et al 2011 the relationship between phb synthesis and serine metabolism is shown in fig 7 fitzgerald and lidstrom 2003 korotkova and lidstrom 2001 in general the intracellular tca cycle activity is inhibited by limiting the nutrient supply and the addition of malic acid to the culture medium enhances the activity of the phb synthetase by which the phb accumulation accounts for 55 in the cells xin et al 2004 by means of continuous culture the density of the strain methaneocystissp gb 25 dsmz 7674 significantly improved and in turn the cells were transferred to a nitrogen deficient medium after 300 minutes the phb synthesis yield in the cells and the bioconversion efficiency from methane to phb were 51 and 55 respectively wendlandt et al 2005 wendlandt et al 2001 except for the production of phb in mob cells relatively high molecular weight of phb is also expected to promote the commercial use of phb by adding the tca cycle inhibitor citric acid in the culture medium the phb yield increases by 40 and the molecular weight is up to 1 5 mda doronina et al 2008 the presence of cation can inhibit phb production and decrease the molecular weight of phb helm et al 2008 however the nutrients in the culture medium is beneficial to increase the molecular weight of phb due to the influence of the key enzyme activities xin et al 2011 in addition based on the theory of metrology the methane bioconversion efficiency to phb synthesis is approximately 67 ueda et al 1992 yet the actual bioconversion efficiency was only 54 during the culture of methylocystis spp gb250sm wendlandt et al 2001 4 4 3 extraction and purification of pha pha is soluble in organic solvents thereby the pha extraction process can be initiated by the lysis of mob cells and then dissolving pha in organic solvents pha can be simply extracted by the separation properties of the organic solvent which mainly contains cyclic carbonates chlorinated hydrocarbons tetrahydrofuran and azeotropes of chlorinated hydrocarbons ramsay et al 1994 although the obtained pha has large molecular weight and high purity the extraction solution becomes viscous and subsequently decreases the extraction efficiency due to the low solubility of pha choi and lee 1997 in addition the production cost of pha will be reduced when the extraction methods based on pure aqueous medium and hypotonic shock osmotic shock were applied the intracellular phb can be released into the aqueous medium and in turn the high purity of phb is gained by washing the cell lysis suspension and collecting the sedimentation after low speed centrifugation fernandez castillo et al 1986 4 5 methane proteins single cell protein produced by methanotrophs can also be defined as the methane protein which the nitrogen source was directly derived from ammonia nitrogen methane protein can be effectively achieved through rump cycle serine cycle and cbb cycle from type i methanotrophs type ii methanotrophs and verrucomicrobia fig 8 4 5 1 raw materials and strains the raw materials for methane protein production can be generally divided into three categories 1 agricultural wastes and wastewater including rice straw fruit nucleus syrup and bagasse 2 industrial wastes and wastewater including brewhouse paper mills soy oil plants and monosodium glutamate plants and 3 petroleum natural gas and their coproducts including methanol ethanol acetic acid citric acid and poly alkanes the methane protein is stable and difficult to deteriorate and presents notable performances in mob fermentation process with high bioconversion rate low production cost and little toxic to products strong et al 2015 fast growing and high protein production should be the primary characteristics of mob for methane protein production the methane protein can be produced by the mob when methane is introduced as the carbon source and the protein concentration is up to 50 70 after the drying process strong et al 2015 in addition relatively mild ph and temperature range as well as safety to human health ought to be comprehensively considered once methane protein is provided for commercial use 4 5 2 characteristics and safety of methane protein 4 5 2 1 characteristics of methane protein studies have shown that methylococcus capsulatus and mefhyzomonas albm both contain nutrient rich amino acid components and the content of arginine and tryptophan is relatively higher d mello 1973 by providing 91 methane 5 ethane 1 7 propane 1 butane and higher alkanes methanobacteria capsulatm became the dominant strain for methane production in the fermentation process although the associated genus aneurinibacinus brevibacillus agri and ralstonia were identified subsequently the terminal products methane protein was not inclusive of heritable endotoxin which demonstrated that the use of methane for the synthesis of bacterial protein is desirable feasible and with high safety bothe et al 2002 compared with fishmeal methane protein possesses lower lysine content and higher tryptophan content moreover methane protein contains more tryptophan and methionine than soy flour schøyen et al 2007 distributed on the cell membrane and cell wall the phosphonolipid ratio in methane protein is high and the 16 0 and 16 1 fatty acids account for 85 of the total fatty acids makula 1978 müller et al 2005 müller et al 2004 there is no indication that methane protein has adverse effect on the growth and health of pig and trout and the enzyme activity involved in fat metabolism protein synthesis and plasma metabolites were not influenced by the addition of methane protein to the original fodders hanson and hanson 1996 murrell et al 2000 the abdominal fat of broilers will be well maintained and the ratio of lean to fat in broilers will increase along with the partial replacement of fishmeal by methane protein schøyen et al 2007 in addition the quality of pork is improved and the rate of lipid oxidation in frozen storage and the oxidation of fatty substances during broiler storage are both reduced schøyen et al 2007 schøyen et al 2007 skrede et al 2009 implied that the use of methane protein is safe and promising 4 5 2 2 safety of methane protein almost 60 70 of the total nitrogen content in methane protein presents in the form of amino acids while the residual nitrogen content is in the form of nucleic acids the nucleic acid content accounts for about 0 1 g g dcw in mob skrede et al 1998 which is higher than other traditional edible proteins long term consumption of proteins containing high nucleic acid content can result in gout for human beings thereby the safety issue must be proposed when methane protein adopted furthermore high protein content excellent amino acids components and low nucleic acid content should be the development of methane protein industry which also shows the great practical significance in greenhouse gas reduction and protein resource supplement 4 6 extracellular polysaccharides eps due to the good colloid and adhesive performances eps has been widely applied in oil textile and pharmaceutical industries the biosynthesis rate of eps production by methanotrophs in chemostats was as high as 0 43 g eps g dcw malashenko et al 2001 and the viscosity of eps produced by mesophilic methanotrophs was up to 2 2 to 4 0 mm2 s comparable to the viscosity of eps solutions synthesized by other known microorganisms therefore providing a promising pathway for eps production from mob fig 9 extreme salinity condition can facilitate the eps production and the accumulation of eps reach 1 8 g eps g dcw by the use of m alcaliphilum cantera et al 2018 cantera et al 2018 also discovered that the stringent and stressful conditions and high microbial diversity is conducive to increase eps production than those under mild environmental conditions the eps content reach the peak value of 2 6 g eps l by the symbionts that consisted of methanotrophic halomonas marinobacter methylophaga and methylomicrobium cantera et al 2018 in addition the microbial community shift from type i to type ii mob according to the phospholipid fatty acid analysis was discovered when low concentration of oxygen was introduced to the culture medium wilshusen et al 2004 and the final eps production increased by a factor 2 5 owing to the more stable methane oxidation process 5 bioconversion of methane for wastewater treatment the presence of methane oxidizing bacteria mob is beneficial to achieve methane reduction therefore the bioconversion process is significant to environmental protection and global warming for the sake of energy saving and emission reduction the existence of methane is widely applied in nitrogen removal resource recovery and emerging contaminants removal processes 5 1 nitrogen removal relatively high nitrogen content in effluent may lead to downstream eutrophication and the release of toxic substances from dead aquatic organisms thus a cost effective and sustainable nitrogen removal has become a significant topic in wastewater treatment process organic matters are generally required for the growth of denitrifying bacteria in low strength wastewater and methanol acetate and glucose are the main carbon source wang et al 2019 however the operational cost and secondary pollution to downstream proves that the addition of carbon source is not sustainable and feasible wang et al 2020 methane and its secondary high value added product methanol can promote denitrification under microaerobic condition sollo et al 1976 fuhs 1978 as described and elucidated by rhee et al fuhs 1978 methane was acted as the electron donor and the intermediates methanol was subsequently used for denitrification by the synergistic effect of mob and denitrifying bacteria in addition denitrification dependent anaerobic methane oxidation damo process is a newly discovered and important nitrogen cycling pathway the process is mainly completed by candidatus m oxyfera which microorganisms directly use ammonia nitrogen as electrons donor and nitrite nitrate as the electron acceptors hu et al 2015 the deep study for damo process is remarkably important for wwtps because ammonia nitrogen and methane are the final products in ad process methane mass balances indicate that dissolved methane corresponded to 20 60 of the overall methane generated in ad process silva teira et al 2017 and damo generally has a removal rate of more than 95 for dissolved methane lim et al 2021 integrating damo with anammox provides alternative solutions to simultaneously remove nitrogen and mitigate methane emission from wastewater treatment process at present the co existence of anammox and damo bacteria has been detected in many wwtps meng et al 2021 however the practical application of damo has been greatly limited by slow growing damo microorganisms living on low solubility gaseous methane therefore a novel membrane aerated membrane bioreactor mambr was developed to fast enrich damo and anammox co cultures from mixed sludge and the stable and efficient denitrification capacity was well maintained by increasing the frequency of methane flushing nie et al 2019 although the damo process possesses crucial application and commercial use value for nitrogen removal the knowledge about the characteristics and cost of stable operation and the potential environmental risks is still scant 5 2 resource recovery industrial wastewater contains a large amount of sulfate and metal ions such as fe3 cu2 ni2 cd2 ni2 cr2 mo2 pb2 and zn2 although the industrial wastewaters are generally treated before being discharged to wwtps the removal efficiencies of sulfate and metal ions are still limited therefore sulfate reducing bacteria srb was used to recover the metal elements in wwtps mulchandani and westerhoff 2016 electron donor for desulfurization is required for srb however there are large discrepancies in both the cost and the effect to the growth of srb of electron donors the efficiency of desulfurization the cost the availability and feasibility as well as environmental friendliness are the criteria to the selection of srb electron donors in practical applications the electron donors that can be used by srb including methanol ethanol formic acid pyruvic acid zero valent iron zacarías estrada et al 2020 zhou and xing 2015 methane cannot be directly adopted as the electron donor by srb however it was discovered that methane anaerobic oxidation could provide a new source of electron donors to achieve sulfate reduction for srb metcalfe et al 2020 and subsequently enhance the sulfur and metal elements recovery in addition the added value of recovered sulfur and metal elements is relatively low therefore the production of high value added chemicals should be further studied through the elucidation of symbiotic mechanism between srb and mob and the construction of srb mob symbionts 5 3 emerging contaminants removal methane can be oxidized by mob for growth and this type of bacteria can also utilize hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and trichloroethylene tce to reduce ecological risks scheutz and kjeldsen 2003 the recovery of tce by mob had been well studied and the growth rate of mob was found accelerated when methane was highly oxidized alvarez cohen and speitel 2001 additionally the biodegradation of hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons was also obtained by the mechanism of co metabolism pant and pant 2010 semrau 2011 however semrau et al semrau et al 2010 shows that the degradation of tce is not beneficial to the growth of mob due to the decline of cell reducing power and the formation of toxic substances epoxy compounds current investigations have shown that the methane oxidization rate gradually decreases along with the increase of trichloroethane tce and methylene chloride concentrations which the methane oxidation rate decreased from 35 0 to 19 1 ugch4 h g albanna et al 2010 lee et al lee et al 2010 have shown that the methane oxidation performance of mob can not be inhibited when exposed to benzene and toluene but this type of mob was screened and identified from the constructed wetland the tertiary treatment of wwtps mob bacteria also performs good removal efficiency on some other emerging contaminants 3 nitro 1 2 4 triazol 5 one nto and 2 4 dinitroanisole dnan are generally used to make explosive compounds and munition items studies have shown that nto and dnan can be completely degraded by mob under aerobic conditions fuller et al 2021 in addition natural organic micropollutants omps hormones e1 and e2 were able to be effectively removed by mob and the removal efficiency of antibiotics including erythromycin ery fluoxetine flx roxithromycin rox and sulfamethoxazole smx could be up to 50 in the bioreactor martínez quintela et al 2021 selenium se pollution from water is mainly caused by mining metal refining and flue gas desulfurization industries however rapid methane dependent selenate reduction can be achieved by the methanotrophic mixture of methanotrophic archaea methanosarcina and bacteria methylocystis shi et al 2020 6 conclusions and future prospects wwtp has been considered as the source of atmospheric methane yet methane can also be utilized to achieve nitrogen removal emerging contaminants removal and resource recovery and further produce high value added chemicals from mob the reality is that the production of methane is limited therefore co digestion of excess sludge with organic wastes sludge pretreatment and optimization of wastewater and sludge treatment process in wwtp should be focused on to increase the production of methane in the future up to now the bioconversion process of methane by mob still confronts many bottlenecks including the high density culture of mob and the extraction and purification of the terminal products four basic ways should be investigated in detail to overcome the application concerns 1 mass transfer 2 design of bioreactor and culture medium 3 regulation of cultivation conditions and 4 selection of cultivation methods additionally in order to achieve sustainable economy and environment development the current cognition on the practical application of mob is still unsubstantial future efforts ought to be carried out on following three aspects 1 construct recombinant strains with rapid growth and high production of value added chemicals through genetic engineering and metabolic engineering 2 develop new methods to enhance methane transfer and products yield in mob fermentation tanks 3 extraction and purification techniques should be developed for mob to produce new products declaration

16985,methane is a type of renewable fuel that can generate many types of high value added chemicals however besides heat and power production there is little methane utilization in most of the wastewater treatment plants wwtps all round the world currently in this review the status of methane production performance from wwtps was firstly investigated subsequently based on the identification and classification of methane oxidizing bacteria mob the key enzymes and metabolic pathway of mob were presented in depth then the production extraction and purification process of high value added chemicals including methanol ectoine biofuel bioplastic methane protein and extracellular polysaccharides were introduced in detail which was conducive to understand the bioconversion process of methane finally the use of methane in wastewater treatment process including nitrogen removal emerging contaminants removal as well as resource recovery was extensively explored these findings could provide guidance in the development of sustainable economy and environment and facilitate biological methane conversion by using mob in further attempts graphical abstract image graphical abstract

structure and high degree of tetrahedral symmetry methane is the final product from the anaerobic treatment of contaminants methane is the colorless and odorless greenhouse gas and accounts for 22 of total persistent greenhouse gases lelieveld et al 1998 in the atmosphere which becomes a major concern to global climate change due to the methane emission from biological activities atmospheric concentration of methane tellingly increased at a rate of 1 per year cicerone and oremland 1988 research shows that the amount of methane that contributed by microorganisms in the atmosphere is more than 350 tg every year conrad 2009 therefore developing techniques for upgrading the value of methane is highly urgent however besides heat and power generation by combustion methane is extraordinarily difficult to be utilized under mild conditions the methane conversion ratio ranged from 3 50 was achieved by chemical catalysis at relatively higher temperature and pressure circumstance while more operation cost was required as mo hg or even au were used as the catalysts lee et al 2016 in recent 15 years methane oxidizing bacteria mob was discovered as a type of microorganism that was able to reduce atmospheric methane and mitigate global warming gupta et al 2013 reeburgh 2007 more than 60 of methane bioconversion ratio by methylosinus trichosporium ob3b facilitates the utilization of methane resources lee et al 2016 and the high production of value added chemicals and high bioconversion of methane can be further desired especially when micro bubble and nano bubble aeration techniques was employed the present review summarizes the current status and potential risks on methane in wwtps with an emphasis on the identification classification and performance of methane monooxygenase mmo and mob and the bioconversion of methane for high value added chemicals production by mob was highlighted in addition the use of mob in nitrogen removal resource recovery and emerging contaminants removal was investigated to provide extensive applications of methane in wastewater treatment process based on carbon neutral 2 methane and wastewater treatment plants wwtps 2 1 production of methane in wwtps wwtps have been considered as the relatively strong yet poorly constrained sources of atmospheric greenhouse gas where methane carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide were the principal components mannina et al 2018 however the contribution of methane emissions to the greenhouse gas footprint were slightly higher than the carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions the methane emissions daelman et al 2012 for wastewater treatment increased to 2892 thousand tons in 2012 and also took a larger share 5 17 of total methane emissions zhao et al 2019 methane is the final product in anaerobic wastewater and sludge treatment processes approximately 86 4 of methane emissions were derived from anaerobic treatment tanks in wwtps masuda et al 2015 which could be subsequently released to the atmosphere by intensive mechanical aeration and surface diffusion in addition methane formation in sewer systems was found to be a new pathway of methane emission in wastewater treatment processes and the production of methane is positively correlated with the hydraulic retention time of wastewater guisasola et al 2008 anaerobic organics decomposition processes in sewer systems led to substantial methane release from liquid phase in pump station by water turbulence and in aerated grit chambers by intensive mechanical aeration wang et al wang et al 2011 studied that large quantities of methane could be generated and emit under both anaerobic and aerobic steps in full scale anaerobic anoxic aerobic aao wastewater treatment process due to the low dissolved oxygen do concentration and the most significant factors influencing ch4 methane emissions were do content in aerated grit chamber and oxic tank and wastewater temperature in high density settler tanks additionally the presence of nitrite and nitrate were discovered that could effectively inhibit methane formation in anaerobic wastewater treatment process and the inhibition threshold of nitrite and nitrate were 8 0 and 0 07 mg l respectively banihani et al 2009 jiang et al 2010 the specific methane production rate from sludge buffer tank and sludge storage tank were 3 5 g ch4 kgtss digested sludge d and 1 0 ch4 kgtss dewatered sludge d respectively while the specific methane production rate was at the peak value of 9 0 g ch4 kgtss digested sludge d in anaerobic digestion ad tank daelman et al 2012 therefore 75 of methane emission originated from ad process which the establishment of ad facilities should be taken into consideration when determining the methane footprint of wwtps conversely 80 of the methane diffusing to the activated sludge process was gradually oxidized daelman et al 2012 due to the good handling of ventilation air consequently the installation of ventilation could be adopted as a strategy to further reduce methane emissions from wastewater treatment process in addition an interesting investigation presented that the maximum methane flux occurred at the export of sludge screw conveyor wang et al 2011 after sludge centrifugal dewatering process which was 823 g m2 d the possible reason could be attributed to the formation condition and diffusion of methane because large amounts of methane is produced owing to the relatively high ambient temperature and anoxic conditions within the centrifugal equipment then methane diffuses along with the transport of dewatered sludge and finally emits to atmosphere from the export of sludge screw conveyor daelman et al 2012 filho 2005 2 2 dissolved methane the influent of wwtp contains dissolved methane is primarily formed in the sewer system daelman et al 2012 50 of methane produced from anaerobic processes remains dissolved within the effluent that discharged from the anaerobic treatment reactor and further resulted in large dissolved methane emission rates and export rates from effluents liu et al 2014 it was found that the methane flux from oxic tanks was relatively high yet the dissolved methane content was the lowest the possible reason could be attributed to the sufficient aeration which was able to strip most of the dissolved methane from the wastewater daelman et al 2012 in addition the content of dissolved methane in the influent pump station and aerated grit chambers were discovered much higher than that in other wastewater treatment facilities effluent methane concentration was linearly related to the organic loading rate of the wastewater regnier et al 2013 and the production of methane mainly depends on the amount of degradable organic components in the wastewater zhao et al 2019 however there was no significant correlation between effluent dissolved methane and influent chemical oxygen demand cod and the linear equation of effluent dissolved methane μmol l and influent cod μmol l can be briefly described as zhao et al 2019 deff ch4 2 37 10 5cod 0 09 dissolved methane that leaves the anaerobic treatment tanks including digester the gravitational thickener for the primary sludge the sludge thickeners as well as centrifuge for sludge dewatering will be either introduced to the downstream processing facilities or to the influent pump station and aeration tanks and most of the dissolved methane can be effectively oxidized by the activated sludge daelman et al 2012 the average methane emission was estimated to be 266 227 mg ch4 yr and 0 02 of the total estimated methane emission was exported in dissolved form within the effluent alshboul et al 2016 however alshboul et al alshboul et al 2016 demonstrated that the content of dissolved methane and carbon dioxide were enhanced and the atmospheric fluxes of both gases increased by factors of 1 2 and 8 6 when effluent was discharged to the receiving streamwater thus the likely environmental risks to the surrounding aquatic ecosystems should not be avoided 2 3 emission of methane in wwtps there is potential for mitigating methane emissions from wwtps and good regulation of do was conducive to prevent methane production wang et al 2011 however the determination of methane emission principally depend on socioeconomic factors including economic development government and technology selection zhao et al 2019 according to the investigation in 229 chinese cities the total methane emissions from wwtps amounted to 1169 8 thousand tons 2014 which took a share 83 8 of the national total methane emissions from wwtps zhao et al 2019 cities with bigger populations produce more methane from wwtps since more wastewater tend to be generated and most of these cities also demonstrated greater per capita methane emissions emission factor ef and the influent degradable organic components zhao et al 2019 mainly determined the considerable discrepancies in methane emissions in different cities and gross domestic product gdp population as well as higher water quality stress were strongly correlated with biodegradable organic components in wastewater which could further influence methane emissions 3 methane oxidizing bacteria mob and methane monooxygenase mmo methane oxidizing bacteria is a branch of methylotrophic bacteria with methane as the principal carbon and energy source kalyuzhnaya et al 2015 which can convert methane into carbon dioxide and mitigate the greenhouse effect shindell et al 2012 and thus attracted more attention mob the first strain söhngen et al 1906 that isolated in 1906 are widely distributed in ecosystems and many studies demonstrates the characteristics of aerobic mob because the generation time is short and the pure culture is easy to obtain this type of mob can be divided into methane assimilating bacteria mab and autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aaob the mab possesses a complete pathway of methane oxidation and cellular carbon was synthesized during the methane oxidization process nunoura et al 2008 orphan et al 2002a while aaob oxidizes ammonia nitrogen to sustain the autotrophic growth and assimilates carbon dioxide to cellular carbon through calvin benson bassham cbb cycle another type of mob is a branch of methyl oxidizing bacteria which can only use methane as the carbon and energy source methanol can be produced through mmo in mob and subsequently being oxidized to formaldehyde then formaldehyde is assimilated into cell carbon or biomass and finally becomes the terminal product carbon dioxide after experiences a series of dehydrogenation reactions fig 1 conrad 1996 with the function of methane consumption mob plays an important role in mitigating global warming and further positively influence carbon oxygen and nitrogen cycles in the aquatic ecosystem hanson and hanson 1996 besides owing to the synthesis of cell carbon or biomass mob may possess great potential for the production of high value added chemicals including biofuel bioplastics methane protein as well as extracellular polysaccharides mandernack et al 2000 3 1 identification and classification of mob 3 1 1 aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria aerobic mob is gram negative bacteria that have performed commercial use potential in production practice and played a significant role in the global carbon cycle aerobic mob has been divided into three groups which the basic information was summarized in table 1 kalyuzhnaya 2016 in addition aerobic mob can be characterized into three categories based on the cell structure morphology function microbial physiology and the evolutionary relationship of the systems table 2 the first category includes type i and type x mob with a total of 10 genera which all belonging to γ proteobacteria methylococcus methylomonas methylosoma methylothermus methylobacter methylosarcina methylohalobius methylosphaera methylomicrobium and methylocaldum of which methylocaldum and methylococcus type x are able to utilize three classical carbon assimilation pathways fig 2 namely ribulose monophosphate cycle rump cycle serine cycle serine cycle and calvin cycle calvin benson bassham cbb cycle conversely the rest of the eight genera can only metabolize the rump cycle to assimilate c1 component equipped with intracellular cytoplasmic membranes icm particulate methane monooxygenase pmmo can be attached which is conducive for type i mob to utilize rump cycle supplementary figure 1 and further achieve to methane oxidation the second category is consisted of type ii mob with a total of five genera which all belonging to α proteobacteria methylosinus methylocystis methylocella methylocapsa and methyloferula these genera utilize serine cycle supplementary figure 2 for c1 component assimilation and except for methylocella the other genera do not possess intact icm structure and contain soluble methane monooxygenase smmo dedysh and dunfield 2011 hanson and hanson 1996 the third category of aerobic mob is mainly the thermophilic acidophilic bacteria belonging to verrucomicrobia the genus methylacidiphilum can firstly converts methane into carbon dioxide and subsequently utilize cbb cycle to assimilate carbon dioxide and form carboxylase vorobev et al 2013 in addition with the marked development of phospholipid compounds analysis the mob can be effectively identified and classified c16 fatty acids were dominated in type i and type x mob while type ii mob is predominantly c18 fatty acids especially 18 1ω8c and 18 1ω7c fatty acids bowman et al 1991 scheller et al 2016 3 1 2 anaerobic methane oxidizing bacteria owing to relatively long cell generation time and slow growth rate of anaerobic mob only three principal kinds of anaerobic methane oxidation processes were discovered 1 sulphate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation samo the process is completed by a symbiotic relationship which is composed of srb and anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme caldwell et al 2008 so4 2 was used as the final electron acceptor and hs and hco3 were generated along with the reduction of sulfate anme can be divided into three groups based on the phylogenetic analysis anme 1 genus methanosarcinales and methanomicrobiales anme 2 genus methanosarcinales and anme 3 genus methanococcoides niemann et al 2006 candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens belonging to the anme sub class is the only archaea that utilizes methane as the electron donor and nitrate as the electron acceptor for both methane oxidation and denitrification haroon et al 2013 and the candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera that is capable of anaerobic methane oxidation affiliated with nc10 family table 2 2 denitrification dependent anaerobic methane oxidation damo anme haroon et al 2013 and typical m oxyfera an uncultivated bacteria belonging to the nc10 family ettwig et al 2008 both metabolize methane as the electron donor and nitrite or nitrate were reduced to n2 3 fe3 dependent and mn4 dependent anaerobic methane oxidation the major microorganisms that worked in this process are ambiguous yet methane was found that could be used as the electron donor and ferric or manganese were adopted as the electron acceptors for reduction reactions norði et al 2013 3 2 methane monooxygenases mmo derived from mob mmo is a complicated macromolecular protein complex that catalyzes methane to produce methanol by the oxidation of methane c h bond methanol chan et al 2013 the movement in mmo subunits or between amino acid side chains is beneficial to the catalytic process when external driving force chemical energy is provided soluble mmo principally distributed in the cytoplasm and particulate mmo mainly distributed on the cell membrane only a small amount of mob contain both smmo and pmmo hanson and hanson 1996 murrell et al 2000 and except for methylocella all currently known aerobic mob contain pmmo dedysh et al 2000 3 2 1 soluble methane monooxygenase smmo the smmo is complex in composition and possesses a wide range of substrates including methane short chain alkanes alkenes as well as aromatics trotsenko and murrell 2008 the smmo consists of three typical proteins namely hydroxylase mmoh molecular weight of 251 kda protein b mmob molecular weight of 16 kda and reductase mmor molecular weight of 39 kda mmoh presents the dimer αβγ 2 form and equipped with three subunits α β and γ protein b is able to regulate the catalytic reaction of smmo by coupling electrons when the hydroxylation of the substrate was catalyzed in the active center of mmoh mmor contains a coenzyme fad and a double iron disulfide 2fe 2s cluster and the reducing power of the reaction is generally supplied with nad p h dalton 2005 lee et al 2013 the gene cluster size of smmo is 5 5 kb and its order is mmoxybzdc which encodes the α subunit of hydroxylase the β subunit of hydroxylase the regulatory protein b the γ subunit of hydroxylase mmod protein and reduction enzyme c hua et al 2011 trotsenko and murrell 2008 the expression of smmo gene is required at low concentrations of copper ions which acts as activator and promoter of the mmox gene supplementary figure 3 up to now there are three methane oxidation hypotheses about the mechanism of c h bond cleavage 1 c h bond homolysis formation of free radicals 2 c h bond heterolysis formation of carbanion intermediates to maintain the stability and 3 c h bond cleavage synergistic reaction of methane and fe o dalton 2005 3 2 2 particulate methane monooxygenase pmmo the pmmo is a copper containing membrane bound protein tavormina et al 2013 other than smmo pmmo possesses a relatively narrow substrate range which can only oxidize alkanes or alkenes with a carbon chain length of less than c5 due to the low enzymatic activity under air exposure dalton 2005 murrell et al 2000 when oxidizing the c h bond at the c2 position of c2 c5 from alcohol or olefin the corresponding product ethylene oxide was generated chen et al 2014 the coding gene of pmmo is transcribed at high copper ion concentrations pmmo consists of hydroxylase pmmoh and reductase pmmor the pmmoh contains three subunits α pmob β pmoa and γ pmoc with the respective molecular weight of 45 27 and 23 kda while the pmmor consists of a protein with a molecular weight of 63 and 8 kda dispirito et al 1991 murrell et al 2000 the active center of pmmo contains two metal sites 1 the double copper center at the pmob subunit and 2 the center of the variable metal site at the pmoc subunit liew et al 2014 according to the crystal structure of pmmo the metal elements in the active center may present in the three copper clusters of the pmoa subunit or the double iron clusters exist in the pmoc subunit or the triple copper cluster located in the pmob subunit bollinger 2010 affected by the content of copper ions the expression levels of different types of mmo showed that pmmo requires comparably higher copper ion content relative to smmo ho et al 2013 the oxygen binding site of pmmo is located at the double copper ion center of the soluble portion in pmob and the active site of pmmo is located in the soluble n terminal region of the pmob subunit wang and lippard 2014 therefore the c h bond was considered as the rate limiting step in hydroxylation reaction li et al 2012 however it was discovered that the threonine residue near the center of the double copper ion supplied a hydrogen atom to coordinate copper peroxide to form hydroxylated copper and oxidized copper thereby the hydroxylation of methane occurred li et al 2012 shiota et al 2013 and resulted in the controversial of methanol production from methane in the catalytic process 3 3 metabolic pathways of mob understanding the metabolic pathways of mob including cell compositions bioprocess molecular function and enzyme systems is conducive to reduce greenhouse gas emission control climate change as well as enhance contaminants removal 3 3 1 metabolic pathways of aerobic mob 3 3 1 1 methane and methanol oxidation by oxidizing methane to carbon dioxide mob can produce a series of intermediate metabolites fig 2 which is inclusive of methanol formaldehyde and formic acid the oxidation of methane is carried out by the mmo in which the alkanes cyclic hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds with up to 8 carbons can be oxidized by smmo and alkanes up to 5 carbons are able to be oxidized by pmmo burrows et al 1984 methanol is the first product of methane oxidation subsequently methanol is oxidized by methanol dehydrogenase mdh that distributed in the periplasmic space to form formaldehyde figs 1 and 3 the molecular structure and reaction mechanism of mdh have been extensively investigated in gram negative mob fig 3 anthony and williams 2003 as methanol is a high value added chemicals the gene encoding the large subunit of mdh mxaf in mob is highly conserved bastien et al 1989 mcdonald and murrell 1997 thereby the gene mxaf can be used as the functional gene for identification of mob 3 3 1 2 formaldehyde assimilation c1 component assimilation in aerobic mob can be presented not only at the formaldehyde level through the rump cycle but also at the methylene tetrahydrofolate and carbon dioxide levels through the serine cycle in addition c1 component assimilation occurs at carbon dioxide level through the cbb cycle rump cycle and serine cycle are regarded as the important pathway for type i type ii and type x mob conversely the cbb cycle is present in nc10 bacterium rasigraf et al 2014 1 rump cycle type i mob principally use the rump cycle supplementary figure 1 to assimilate formaldehyde hanson and hanson 1996 fructose 6 phosphate can be converted to pyruvate through entner doudoroff edd and embden meyerhof parnas emp pathways according to the enzyme activity pyruvate was produced from edd pathway in most of the mob however the production of pyruvate in methylomicrobium is the emp pathway based on the 13c stable isotope labeling experiments kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 in addition it has been shown that phosphohexulose synthase hps and hexoseose isomerase hpi were required to maintain the rump cycle and relatively high active hps and hpi are outstanding markers of carbon fixation through the rump cycle anthony 1975 2 serine cycle the pathway for the formaldehyde assimilation by type ii mob is the serine cycle supplementary figure 2 hanson and hanson 1996 formaldehyde produces formate by means of the tetrahydromethane pterin h4mtp pathway which is then converted to methylene tetrahydrofolate ch2 h4f by the tetrahydrofolate h4f pathway and finally enters the serine cycle fig 2 via demethyltransferase c1 component assimilation through the serine cycle requires the regeneration of glyoxylate from acetyl coa and the glyoxylate can be supplemented by emc pathway supplementary figure 2 chistoserdova et al 2009 genes are often clustered and coordinated in serine cycle kalyuzhnaya and lidstrom 2005 and the structure and function of the gene cluster are surprisingly complex the genome of m oxysporum is inclusive of many genes encoding the serine cycle but they are rarely clustered ward et al 2004 3 cbb cycle a fairly large number of mob are able to assimilate c1 component through cbb cycle and two major categories of mob were discovered namely verrucomicrobia m infernorum op den camp et al 2009 and n10 anaerobic mob m oxyfera ettwig et al 2010 the cbb cycle uses carbon dioxide as the carbon source to synthesize cellular components and subsequently generate energy for the growth of cells khadem et al 2011 in addition it is conspicuous that the transformation of carbon dioxide by the cbb cycle can not only metabolize the carbon dioxide produced by the mob genera itself but also utilize the carbon dioxide from the environment which demonstrates an important application to further reduce greenhouse effect 3 3 2 metabolic pathways of anaerobic mob 3 3 2 1 samo samo is the first methane anaerobic oxidation pathway which can be divided into three groups namely anme 1 anme 2 and anme 3 anme 1 shows relatively further relationship with m mazei while anme 2 belongs to the methanosarcina thermophila and anme 3 is a newly identified archaea group which is close to methanococcoides knittel et al 2005 lösekann et al 2007 niemann et al 2006 the symbiotic growth between anme 1 and srb is relatively loose knittel et al 2005 however a close symbiont with srb can be formed from anme 2 and anme 3 orphan et al 2002b besides methane oxidation anme 1 can grow with acetic acid propionic acid or butyric acid as well knittel et al 2005 yet the subtype of anme 2 namely anme 2d has further homology with other members of anme 2 which is not capable of oxidizing methane and cannot form a symbionts with srb orphan et al 2001 at present the methane oxidation mechanism of anme is not clear and three possible theoretical models were successively proposed namely reverse methanogenesis theory acetic acid theory and methylation theory lloyd et al 2011 found that anme 1 could use the reverse methanogenic pathway for methane oxidation under certain conditions lloyd et al 2011 3 3 2 2 damo damo has long been discovered that the methane oxidation can be coupled with denitrification in wastewater treatment process sollo et al 1976 which nitrite nitrate can be used as the final electron acceptor islas lima et al 2004 islas lima et al 2004 introduced methane into the wastewater with relatively high nitrite nitrate concentration under anoxic conditions and discovered that both nitrite nitrate and methane can be effectively removed the results from hu et al hu et al 2009 hu et al 2011 showed that relatively high temperature was conducive to the growth of archaea but low temperature led to the elimination of archaea candidatus m oxyfera is in favor of growing with nitrite as the substrate while when nitrate is used as the substrate the dominant genus was archaea associated with anme other than candidatus m oxyfera in addition the microbial activity of candidatus m oxyfera will be significantly inhibited when the concentration of nitrite exceeds 1 mmol l the latest research on candidatus m oxyfera demonstrates that the methane oxidation pathway by candidatus m oxyfera is completely different from the mob that have been discovered a new pathway named intra aerobic denitrification for the oxidation of methane the shape of the cell was polygonal wu et al 2012 and presented no endomembrane structure hanson and hanson 1996 but possessed an outer sheath proteins luesken et al 2011 luesken et al 2011 found that the presence of nc10 bacteria similar to candidatus m oxyfera was detected in 9 wastewater treatment plants in netherlands and effective nitrogen removal and methane anaerobic oxidation can be both obtained the growth rate of candidatus m oxyfera becomes slow when excess oxygen existed in the biological tank of wwtps and the bioactivity will be further inhibited and can not be recovered even oxygen is consumed luesken et al 2012 3 3 2 3 ferric manganese as the final electron acceptor fe3 and mn4 can also be the final electron acceptor associated with methane oxidation under anaerobic conditions beal et al 2009 and anme 1 and anme 3 involved in the process it can be speculated that due to the huge flux of ferric and manganese discharged from wwtps to the river each year the contribution of the above process to anaerobic methane oxidation may be noteworthy additionally since the research on the process was recently discovered consequently the identification of strains the conditions of the process and the microbiological mechanism of its effects need to be further investigated 4 bioconversion of methane for high value added chemicals production by the use of methane as the raw material to produce chemicals via microbial fermentation or refining can not only obtain the aims of methane emission reduction greenhouse effect mitigation but also can synthesize high value added products which is significant to alleviate energy crises and achieve resource recovery the high value added chemicals produced by mob can be used as the renewable substitutes including methanol ectoine biofuel bioplastics methane proteins and extracellular polysaccharides table 3 4 1 methanol methanol is generally utilized as the external carbon source to enhance nitrogen and phosphorus removal or in the synthesis of industrial compounds including acetic acid ethanol olefins formaldehyde methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and dimethyl ether dme if no mdh inhibition method was employed ethylene and propylene can be produced from the methanol to olefin mto process which can be further used as the hydrocarbon and organic polymeric materials fig 4 bjorck et al 2018 4 1 1 methanol production by mdh inhibition the basic information of mob that carried out bioconversion from methane to methanol was listed in table 4 the presence of mmo in mob can catalyze the production of methanol from methane and the mdh can oxidize methanol to formaldehyde and finally form carbon dioxide and produce a large amount of nadh fig 3 metal chelating agents benzoquinone high concentration phosphates iodoacetic acid dithiothreitol and glycidol all perform the inhibition effect of mdh thus improving methanol yield carver et al 1984 furuto et al 1999 furuto et al 1999 adopted methanol propanol to inhibit the bioactivity of mtrichos porium ob3b for enhancing methanol production and resulting in a methanol concentration of 6 mmol l thereafter although the accumulation of methanol was achieved by the inhibition of mdh the highest accumulation of methanol concentration was lower than 12 mmol l due to the poor harvesting technique when mob are used to catalyze methane oxidation to methanol the exogenous electron donor must be provided to proceed the methanol production process therefore it can be predicted that the selection of exogenous electron donors will become a hot spot to enhance methanol bioconversion strong et al 2015 4 1 2 methanol production by operation optimization except for the dosage of exogenous electron the operation optimization for good methanol production were extensively studied and the methanol content can reach 2 mmol l based on the optimization of the culture conditions by optimizing the culture conditions the methanol concentration of methylosinustrichosporium ob3b reached the peak value of 152 mmol mg dcw after 100 h of culture with the methanol conversion rate of 61 takeguchi et al 1997 when applied the high density cell culture method in a membrane ventilated bioreactor the concentration of methanol was up to 1 1 g l after 50 h duan et al 2011 in addition the methane and cu 2 concentration cell culture time immobilization of cells as well as exogenous electron donor play important roles in the accumulation of methanol and the existence of carbon dioxide in the culture medium can effectively inhibit the methanol metabolism xin et al 2004 4 2 ectoine 4 2 1 structure and characteristics of ectoine 1 4 5 6 tetrahydro 2 methyl 4 pyrimidinecarboxylic acid ectoine was first identified in ectothiorhodospira halochloris at 1985 with the molecular formula of c6h10n2o2 molecular weight of 142 2 g mol supplementary figure 4 galinski et al 1985 ectoine is an osmotic compensatory solute synthesized by certain microorganisms in response to high osmotic stress with high water soluble no electrostatic charge in the physiological ph range and active groups ectoine can be highly accumulated in cells for further extraction ectoine possesses important commercial use value in the fields of cell protectants biological stabilizers cosmetics and pharmaceutical preparations additionally the presence of ectoine is conducive to the biofilms or cells including protein and nucleic acids to withstand adverse conditions galinski and trüper 1994 pastor et al 2010 4 2 2 synthetic pathway of ectoine halomonas elongate which belonged to the genus methylomicrobium methylobacter and methylohalobius is able to produce ectoine both in batch and continuous bioreactors the biosynthesis of ectoine is a branching pathway of the aspartic acid family in the microbial metabolic network the intermediate metabolite oxaloacetate from the tca cycle produces l aspartic acid under the action of aspartate aminotransferase ast then l aspartic acid is converted to l aspartic acid phosphate by the action of aspartokinase ask and further converted into l aspartic acid phosphate semialdehyde by the action of l aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase asd according to the bioconversion process mentioned above three enzymes l 2 4 diaminobutyric acid acetyltransferase diaminobutyrate 2 oxoglutarate transaminase and ectoine dioxygenase encoded by three genes ecta ectb ectc regulate the synthesis of ectoine fig 5 cánovas et al 1998 it was discovered that the halophilic methanotrophs and methylotrophs both isolated and identified from genus methylomicrobium were able to accumulate ectoine at a level of 0 2 g g dcw and the flora may be reused for nine times which the final average yield of ectoine is as high as 0 155 g g dcw sauer and galinski 1998 strong et al 2015 4 2 3 extraction and purification of ectoine ectoine is a small and hydrophilic biomolecule and is also soluble in organic solvents according to the hypotonic impact method the intracellular ectoine can be extracted and further purified by ion exchange concentration and crystallization onraedt et al 2005 adopted organic solvent extraction method to recover ectoine from cells in ethanol the ethanol enriched in ectoine was finally dosed to the viscous residue in the mass ratio of 3 1 and obtained 66 of the ectoine after four times crystallization onraedt et al 2005 in addition ectoine can also be collected by aqueous phase extraction since ectoine is able to be released into the water phase and 75 99 of high purity of ectoine can be obtained after ion exchange and crystallization ono et al 1999 4 3 biofuel 4 3 1 short chain fatty acids scfas production the shortage of crude oil can be forecasted in the near future therefore methane with vast reserve and extensive source attracts more attention through the microbial conversion process scfas including acetate propionate butyrate valerate as well as caproate are the principal terminal products in the methane bioconversion process anaerobic mob methanoperedens nitroreducens is able to effectively produce the common substrate acetate when nitrite nitrate is given as the electron acceptor cai et al 2018 scfas production rate reach the peak value of 120 g l d due to the high flux of methane was introduced through the hollow fiber membrane chen et al 2018 and relatively low oxygen supply rate was in favor of scfas production and carbon utilization chen et al 2019 4 3 2 lipid production and extraction from mob the production of biofuel directly from methane is a promising approach fig 6 by the use of mob the pmmo in mob will highly expressed when mob grow in the presence of cu2 and subsequently the lipid containing intracellular membrane is highly synthesized and becomes the main component of biomass peltola et al 1993 in order to increase the lipid yield and further convert them to biofuel the fast growing and lipid rich methylomicrobium buryatense 5gb1 and its glycogen knockout mutant ap18 were studied to increase the lipid content of the cell inner membrane and the biofuel yield the highest cell weight was up to 21 4 g l and the maximum lipid productivity was 45 4 mg l h when high cell density cultures with continuous feeds of methane and oxygen were employed in addition the lipid content increased by 90 through limiting the biosynthesis of glycogen in strain ap18 fei et al 2018 although phospholipids are not broadly considered as a good feedstock for the upgradation of hydrocarbon fuels combined with advanced catalyst designs and novel lipid extraction methods two stage pretreatment is adopted and the product can recover as high as 95 of total fatty acids from membrane bound phospholipids the lipid conversion efficiency is over 99 and the final hydrocarbon mixture is on the basis of 88 of pentadecane c15h32 from decarbonylation decarboxylation and hydrogenation of c16 fatty acids indicating that the bioconversion of methane to liquid fuel process is technically feasible and practical 4 3 3 mass transfer improvement to improve the mass transfer efficiency of the substrate the mob m trichosporium ob3b was used and the paraffin oil was added as the methane transporter to enhance the mass transfer of methane to mob cells the cell density was the largest and the cell growth rate was the fastest when the concentration of paraffin oil ranged from 4 to 6 han et al 2009 after the mob fermentation is terminated the dry weight of the cells is higher than 9 89 g l which is 4 5 times higher than the control group the possible reason may be attributed to the addition of paraffin oil leads to the emulsification of the cell culture and change the hydrodynamic properties of the fluids and in turn increase the solution viscosity and enhance the mass transfer of methane additionally the mob cells tend to accumulate at the interface between water and paraffin oil due to the interaction between mob cells and paraffin oil therefore the presence of paraffin oil is conducive to transfer methane to the cells and further accelerate the methane oxidation rate of mob 4 4 bioplastics mob metabolize methane to form formaldehyde and formaldehyde in turn enters the anabolic pathway and synthesize it into acetyl coa fig 7 which is further converted into the polymer substance polyhydroxybutyrate phb and finally conserved in microbial cells phb is a type of polyhydroxyalkanoate pha at present with different monomer structures more than 100 types of phas polymer linear polyester have been studied and identified of which the phb is the earliest and most explored type 4 4 1 structure and characteristics of pha based on the chain length of the constituent monomers pha is divided into three types namely short chain length pha the monomer contains 3 to 5 carbon atoms medium chain length pha the monomer contains 6 to 16 carbon atoms and short and medium chain length copolymerized pha formed by copolymerization of short chain and medium chain monomers hazer and steinbüchel 2007 nomura et al 2008 pha with a variety of monomer types is a kind of biodegradable polymer that possesses similar physical and mechanical properties and good processing properties as traditional plastics due to the differences of chain length and side chain groups pha possesses a diverse material science property in addition being capable of degrading pha to monomer methane carbon dioxide and water pha degrading enzymes can be synthesized in many microorganisms 4 4 2 synthesis of phb in mob it is discovered that only 12 types of mob from 6 genus possess phb accumulation function the dominant type ii strain producing phb can be screened by limiting nitrogen source and methane in the culture medium pieja et al 2012 mob synthesize pha generally through the acetyl coa pathway in which acetyl coa enters the tca cycle and synthesizes various intermediate metabolites to maintain the bioactivity of mob cells under nutrient equilibrium growth conditions however under nutrient limiting condition two acetyl coa molecules are condensed to form acetyl coa by the catalysis of enzyme phaa and then reduced to the precursor substance of phb r 3 hydroxybutyryl coa via the activation of enzyme phab nadph dependent acetyl coa reductase finally enzyme phac pha polymerase promotes the polymerization of phb to pha peoples and sinskey 1989a b likewise under the nutrient limiting condition the rump pathway and the serine pathway supplementary figures 1 and 2 cannot proceed smoothly and the intermediate metabolites enter the phb synthetic pathway pieja et al 2011 the relationship between phb synthesis and serine metabolism is shown in fig 7 fitzgerald and lidstrom 2003 korotkova and lidstrom 2001 in general the intracellular tca cycle activity is inhibited by limiting the nutrient supply and the addition of malic acid to the culture medium enhances the activity of the phb synthetase by which the phb accumulation accounts for 55 in the cells xin et al 2004 by means of continuous culture the density of the strain methaneocystissp gb 25 dsmz 7674 significantly improved and in turn the cells were transferred to a nitrogen deficient medium after 300 minutes the phb synthesis yield in the cells and the bioconversion efficiency from methane to phb were 51 and 55 respectively wendlandt et al 2005 wendlandt et al 2001 except for the production of phb in mob cells relatively high molecular weight of phb is also expected to promote the commercial use of phb by adding the tca cycle inhibitor citric acid in the culture medium the phb yield increases by 40 and the molecular weight is up to 1 5 mda doronina et al 2008 the presence of cation can inhibit phb production and decrease the molecular weight of phb helm et al 2008 however the nutrients in the culture medium is beneficial to increase the molecular weight of phb due to the influence of the key enzyme activities xin et al 2011 in addition based on the theory of metrology the methane bioconversion efficiency to phb synthesis is approximately 67 ueda et al 1992 yet the actual bioconversion efficiency was only 54 during the culture of methylocystis spp gb250sm wendlandt et al 2001 4 4 3 extraction and purification of pha pha is soluble in organic solvents thereby the pha extraction process can be initiated by the lysis of mob cells and then dissolving pha in organic solvents pha can be simply extracted by the separation properties of the organic solvent which mainly contains cyclic carbonates chlorinated hydrocarbons tetrahydrofuran and azeotropes of chlorinated hydrocarbons ramsay et al 1994 although the obtained pha has large molecular weight and high purity the extraction solution becomes viscous and subsequently decreases the extraction efficiency due to the low solubility of pha choi and lee 1997 in addition the production cost of pha will be reduced when the extraction methods based on pure aqueous medium and hypotonic shock osmotic shock were applied the intracellular phb can be released into the aqueous medium and in turn the high purity of phb is gained by washing the cell lysis suspension and collecting the sedimentation after low speed centrifugation fernandez castillo et al 1986 4 5 methane proteins single cell protein produced by methanotrophs can also be defined as the methane protein which the nitrogen source was directly derived from ammonia nitrogen methane protein can be effectively achieved through rump cycle serine cycle and cbb cycle from type i methanotrophs type ii methanotrophs and verrucomicrobia fig 8 4 5 1 raw materials and strains the raw materials for methane protein production can be generally divided into three categories 1 agricultural wastes and wastewater including rice straw fruit nucleus syrup and bagasse 2 industrial wastes and wastewater including brewhouse paper mills soy oil plants and monosodium glutamate plants and 3 petroleum natural gas and their coproducts including methanol ethanol acetic acid citric acid and poly alkanes the methane protein is stable and difficult to deteriorate and presents notable performances in mob fermentation process with high bioconversion rate low production cost and little toxic to products strong et al 2015 fast growing and high protein production should be the primary characteristics of mob for methane protein production the methane protein can be produced by the mob when methane is introduced as the carbon source and the protein concentration is up to 50 70 after the drying process strong et al 2015 in addition relatively mild ph and temperature range as well as safety to human health ought to be comprehensively considered once methane protein is provided for commercial use 4 5 2 characteristics and safety of methane protein 4 5 2 1 characteristics of methane protein studies have shown that methylococcus capsulatus and mefhyzomonas albm both contain nutrient rich amino acid components and the content of arginine and tryptophan is relatively higher d mello 1973 by providing 91 methane 5 ethane 1 7 propane 1 butane and higher alkanes methanobacteria capsulatm became the dominant strain for methane production in the fermentation process although the associated genus aneurinibacinus brevibacillus agri and ralstonia were identified subsequently the terminal products methane protein was not inclusive of heritable endotoxin which demonstrated that the use of methane for the synthesis of bacterial protein is desirable feasible and with high safety bothe et al 2002 compared with fishmeal methane protein possesses lower lysine content and higher tryptophan content moreover methane protein contains more tryptophan and methionine than soy flour schøyen et al 2007 distributed on the cell membrane and cell wall the phosphonolipid ratio in methane protein is high and the 16 0 and 16 1 fatty acids account for 85 of the total fatty acids makula 1978 müller et al 2005 müller et al 2004 there is no indication that methane protein has adverse effect on the growth and health of pig and trout and the enzyme activity involved in fat metabolism protein synthesis and plasma metabolites were not influenced by the addition of methane protein to the original fodders hanson and hanson 1996 murrell et al 2000 the abdominal fat of broilers will be well maintained and the ratio of lean to fat in broilers will increase along with the partial replacement of fishmeal by methane protein schøyen et al 2007 in addition the quality of pork is improved and the rate of lipid oxidation in frozen storage and the oxidation of fatty substances during broiler storage are both reduced schøyen et al 2007 schøyen et al 2007 skrede et al 2009 implied that the use of methane protein is safe and promising 4 5 2 2 safety of methane protein almost 60 70 of the total nitrogen content in methane protein presents in the form of amino acids while the residual nitrogen content is in the form of nucleic acids the nucleic acid content accounts for about 0 1 g g dcw in mob skrede et al 1998 which is higher than other traditional edible proteins long term consumption of proteins containing high nucleic acid content can result in gout for human beings thereby the safety issue must be proposed when methane protein adopted furthermore high protein content excellent amino acids components and low nucleic acid content should be the development of methane protein industry which also shows the great practical significance in greenhouse gas reduction and protein resource supplement 4 6 extracellular polysaccharides eps due to the good colloid and adhesive performances eps has been widely applied in oil textile and pharmaceutical industries the biosynthesis rate of eps production by methanotrophs in chemostats was as high as 0 43 g eps g dcw malashenko et al 2001 and the viscosity of eps produced by mesophilic methanotrophs was up to 2 2 to 4 0 mm2 s comparable to the viscosity of eps solutions synthesized by other known microorganisms therefore providing a promising pathway for eps production from mob fig 9 extreme salinity condition can facilitate the eps production and the accumulation of eps reach 1 8 g eps g dcw by the use of m alcaliphilum cantera et al 2018 cantera et al 2018 also discovered that the stringent and stressful conditions and high microbial diversity is conducive to increase eps production than those under mild environmental conditions the eps content reach the peak value of 2 6 g eps l by the symbionts that consisted of methanotrophic halomonas marinobacter methylophaga and methylomicrobium cantera et al 2018 in addition the microbial community shift from type i to type ii mob according to the phospholipid fatty acid analysis was discovered when low concentration of oxygen was introduced to the culture medium wilshusen et al 2004 and the final eps production increased by a factor 2 5 owing to the more stable methane oxidation process 5 bioconversion of methane for wastewater treatment the presence of methane oxidizing bacteria mob is beneficial to achieve methane reduction therefore the bioconversion process is significant to environmental protection and global warming for the sake of energy saving and emission reduction the existence of methane is widely applied in nitrogen removal resource recovery and emerging contaminants removal processes 5 1 nitrogen removal relatively high nitrogen content in effluent may lead to downstream eutrophication and the release of toxic substances from dead aquatic organisms thus a cost effective and sustainable nitrogen removal has become a significant topic in wastewater treatment process organic matters are generally required for the growth of denitrifying bacteria in low strength wastewater and methanol acetate and glucose are the main carbon source wang et al 2019 however the operational cost and secondary pollution to downstream proves that the addition of carbon source is not sustainable and feasible wang et al 2020 methane and its secondary high value added product methanol can promote denitrification under microaerobic condition sollo et al 1976 fuhs 1978 as described and elucidated by rhee et al fuhs 1978 methane was acted as the electron donor and the intermediates methanol was subsequently used for denitrification by the synergistic effect of mob and denitrifying bacteria in addition denitrification dependent anaerobic methane oxidation damo process is a newly discovered and important nitrogen cycling pathway the process is mainly completed by candidatus m oxyfera which microorganisms directly use ammonia nitrogen as electrons donor and nitrite nitrate as the electron acceptors hu et al 2015 the deep study for damo process is remarkably important for wwtps because ammonia nitrogen and methane are the final products in ad process methane mass balances indicate that dissolved methane corresponded to 20 60 of the overall methane generated in ad process silva teira et al 2017 and damo generally has a removal rate of more than 95 for dissolved methane lim et al 2021 integrating damo with anammox provides alternative solutions to simultaneously remove nitrogen and mitigate methane emission from wastewater treatment process at present the co existence of anammox and damo bacteria has been detected in many wwtps meng et al 2021 however the practical application of damo has been greatly limited by slow growing damo microorganisms living on low solubility gaseous methane therefore a novel membrane aerated membrane bioreactor mambr was developed to fast enrich damo and anammox co cultures from mixed sludge and the stable and efficient denitrification capacity was well maintained by increasing the frequency of methane flushing nie et al 2019 although the damo process possesses crucial application and commercial use value for nitrogen removal the knowledge about the characteristics and cost of stable operation and the potential environmental risks is still scant 5 2 resource recovery industrial wastewater contains a large amount of sulfate and metal ions such as fe3 cu2 ni2 cd2 ni2 cr2 mo2 pb2 and zn2 although the industrial wastewaters are generally treated before being discharged to wwtps the removal efficiencies of sulfate and metal ions are still limited therefore sulfate reducing bacteria srb was used to recover the metal elements in wwtps mulchandani and westerhoff 2016 electron donor for desulfurization is required for srb however there are large discrepancies in both the cost and the effect to the growth of srb of electron donors the efficiency of desulfurization the cost the availability and feasibility as well as environmental friendliness are the criteria to the selection of srb electron donors in practical applications the electron donors that can be used by srb including methanol ethanol formic acid pyruvic acid zero valent iron zacarías estrada et al 2020 zhou and xing 2015 methane cannot be directly adopted as the electron donor by srb however it was discovered that methane anaerobic oxidation could provide a new source of electron donors to achieve sulfate reduction for srb metcalfe et al 2020 and subsequently enhance the sulfur and metal elements recovery in addition the added value of recovered sulfur and metal elements is relatively low therefore the production of high value added chemicals should be further studied through the elucidation of symbiotic mechanism between srb and mob and the construction of srb mob symbionts 5 3 emerging contaminants removal methane can be oxidized by mob for growth and this type of bacteria can also utilize hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and trichloroethylene tce to reduce ecological risks scheutz and kjeldsen 2003 the recovery of tce by mob had been well studied and the growth rate of mob was found accelerated when methane was highly oxidized alvarez cohen and speitel 2001 additionally the biodegradation of hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons was also obtained by the mechanism of co metabolism pant and pant 2010 semrau 2011 however semrau et al semrau et al 2010 shows that the degradation of tce is not beneficial to the growth of mob due to the decline of cell reducing power and the formation of toxic substances epoxy compounds current investigations have shown that the methane oxidization rate gradually decreases along with the increase of trichloroethane tce and methylene chloride concentrations which the methane oxidation rate decreased from 35 0 to 19 1 ugch4 h g albanna et al 2010 lee et al lee et al 2010 have shown that the methane oxidation performance of mob can not be inhibited when exposed to benzene and toluene but this type of mob was screened and identified from the constructed wetland the tertiary treatment of wwtps mob bacteria also performs good removal efficiency on some other emerging contaminants 3 nitro 1 2 4 triazol 5 one nto and 2 4 dinitroanisole dnan are generally used to make explosive compounds and munition items studies have shown that nto and dnan can be completely degraded by mob under aerobic conditions fuller et al 2021 in addition natural organic micropollutants omps hormones e1 and e2 were able to be effectively removed by mob and the removal efficiency of antibiotics including erythromycin ery fluoxetine flx roxithromycin rox and sulfamethoxazole smx could be up to 50 in the bioreactor martínez quintela et al 2021 selenium se pollution from water is mainly caused by mining metal refining and flue gas desulfurization industries however rapid methane dependent selenate reduction can be achieved by the methanotrophic mixture of methanotrophic archaea methanosarcina and bacteria methylocystis shi et al 2020 6 conclusions and future prospects wwtp has been considered as the source of atmospheric methane yet methane can also be utilized to achieve nitrogen removal emerging contaminants removal and resource recovery and further produce high value added chemicals from mob the reality is that the production of methane is limited therefore co digestion of excess sludge with organic wastes sludge pretreatment and optimization of wastewater and sludge treatment process in wwtp should be focused on to increase the production of methane in the future up to now the bioconversion process of methane by mob still confronts many bottlenecks including the high density culture of mob and the extraction and purification of the terminal products four basic ways should be investigated in detail to overcome the application concerns 1 mass transfer 2 design of bioreactor and culture medium 3 regulation of cultivation conditions and 4 selection of cultivation methods additionally in order to achieve sustainable economy and environment development the current cognition on the practical application of mob is still unsubstantial future efforts ought to be carried out on following three aspects 1 construct recombinant strains with rapid growth and high production of value added chemicals through genetic engineering and metabolic engineering 2 develop new methods to enhance methane transfer and products yield in mob fermentation tanks 3 extraction and purification techniques should be developed for mob to produce new products declaration

16986,biodegradable polymers have been regarded as a promising solution to tackle the pollutions caused by the wide use of conventional polymers however during the biodegradation process the material fragmentation leads to microplastics in this work the formation of microplastics from biodegradable poly butylene adipate co terephthalate pbat in different aquatic environments was investigated and compared with the common non biodegradable low density polyethylene ldpe the results showed that a much larger quantity of plastic fragments particles were formed in all aquatic environments from pbat than from ldpe in addition uv a pretreatment simulating the exposure to sunlight increased the rate of pbat microplastic formation significantly the size distribution and shapes of the formed microplastics were systematically studied along with changes in the polymer physicochemical properties such as molecular weight thermal stability crystallinity and mechanical properties to reveal the formation process of microplastics this study shows that the microplastic risk from biodegradable polymers is high and needs to be further evaluated with regards to longer timeframes the biological fate of intermediate products and final products in freshwater estuarine and seawater natural habitats especially considering that these microplastics may have good biodegradability in warmer 20 25 water but will most likely be highly persistent in the world s cold deep seas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics biodegradable polymer water pollution poly butylene adipate co terephthalate hydrolysis 1 introduction the wide use of plastics and the lack of proper plastic waste handling has raised many concerns regarding environmental pollution and the accumulation of plastic debris in the world s oceans ateia et al 2020 klingelhofer et al 2020 law 2017 lebreton et al 2017 ó briain et al 2020 ostle et al 2019 degradation rates and half lives of several plastics in natural environments have been estimated recently and for example low density polyethylene ldpe plastic bags 100 µm thick and high density polyethylene plastic bottles 500 µm thick demonstrate half lives of 3 4 and 58 years respectively in marine environments chamas et al 2020 one of the main concerns of plastic pollution is microplastics particle size lower than 5 mm originating from manufacturing plastics primary sources and the degradation of plastic wastes secondary sources cole et al 2011 microplastics are prone to accumulate in the environment and pose a significant risk to ecosystems all over the world andrady 2017 blettler et al 2018 jang et al 2020 lee et al 2020 wagner et al 2018 wang et al 2018 recently the presence of microplastics in even drinking water and bottled water has been recognized koelmans et al 2019 the replacement of conventional non biodegradable polymers with biodegradable polymers has been regarded as a promising solution to tackle the pollution biodegradable polymers often converted from renewable raw materials can break down into low molecular weight compounds such as water methane and carbon dioxide by microorganisms such as bacteria fungi and algae leja and lewandowicz 2010 lucas et al 2008 biodegradable polymers also undergo fragmentation into small particles during the biodegradation break down process and a large number of small plastic particles microplastics are thus formed agarwal 2020 kubowicz and booth 2017 microplastics formed from biodegradable plastic products pose a risk to the environment before being completely degraded besides apart fromapart from biodegradation biodegradable polymers undergo traditional degradation such as oxidation photodegradation weathering aging etc which could accelerate the formation of microplastics kijchavengkul et al 2008 kijchavengkul et al 2010b 2011 sait et al 2020 sørensen et al 2020 wang et al 2020a zhu et al 2020 despite the potential for biodegradation the microplastics formed from biodegradable polymers may have a very long lifetime there are several reasons one is that the biodegradation itself is a time consuming process biodegradability is affected by both biotic and abiotic factors of the environment such as temperature moisture ph bio surfactants and enzymes agarwal 2020 pischedda et al 2019 the ideal conditions are easy to achieve in labs and industrial composting sites but will not be the normal conditions in nature for instance poly lactide acid pla one of the most common biodegradable polymers wei et al 2014 can be rapidly degraded in industrial composting conditions three weeks for pla thin films and six weeks for pla rope weng et al 2013 but undergoes a much slower biodegradation process under natural soil burial conditions rudnik and briassoulis 2011 as a result depending on the type of polymers and their surrounding conditions the microplastics formed from biodegradable polymers can thus be persistent and remain for decades in natural environments kubowicz and booth 2017 when the possible migration from an optimal condition for biodegradation to sub optimal conditions scarce nutrients insufficient water activity low temperature etc caused by environmental factors such as rain wind and tide are considered the lifetime of the formed microplastic may even be much longer furthermore biodegradability is also influenced by polymer characteristics such as crystallinity functional groups and molecular weight pantani et al 2013 tokiwa et al 2009 for semi crystalline polymers the amorphous region is more easily degraded than the crystal region since the crystal structure is less accessible for the aging media such as water oxygen or enzymes alexis 2005 gorrasi et al 2013 mochizuki et al 1995 white et al 2021 consequently the residual microplastic particles will mainly consist of crystallites which will have a much lower biodegradation rate and can thus exist for a long time despite the importance of limiting microplastics from all types of polymers and products very few reports exist on the formation of microplastics from biodegradable plastics agarwal 2020 bagheri et al 2017 kubowicz and booth 2017 weinstein et al 2020 the article aimed to reveal the potential formation of microplastics from biodegradable poly butylene adipate co terephthalate pbat in different aquatic environments at room temperature and to understand the underlying mechanisms pbat having similar mechanical properties as ldpe has been regarded as a promising biodegradable alternative to ldpe especially in disposable products such as mulch films and plastic shopping bags kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 kijchavengkul et al 2010a kijchavengkul et al 2008 kijchavengkul et al 2010b hence the conventional non biodegradable ldpe was selected as a comparison to pbat in this investigation also a uv pretreatment was applied to the plastics to mimic the aging of the plastic products in sunlight before they end up in an aquatic environment the effects of uv in the formation of microplastics in aquatic environments were demonstrated and the morphology of the formed microplastics was studied 2 experimental 2 1 materials and sample preparation pbat having a trademark of ecoflex f blend c1200 and a density of 1260 kg m3 was purchased from basf germany no additives in the pbat were listed in the product datasheet from basf ldpe without additives with a trademark of lupolen 2420 k and a density of 924 kg m3 was purchased from albis sweden the film with a thickness of 20 μm was made with a twin screw extruder brabender 20 40 ls germany using an extrusion temperature profile of 150 250 c from the feeding zone to the film die the film strips 100 20 mm were cut from the extruded film by using a metal template and scalpel one third of the prepared film strips were exposed to uv light at 50 c for 79 h in a quv accelerated weathering tester qpanel lab products cleveland usa to mimic the aging condition of plastic under sunlight the irradiance of the uv light used was 0 76 w m2 at a wavelength of 340 nm representing the long wavelength uva that is barely filtered by the atmosphere approximately 90 of uva from the sun reaching the earth s surface 2 2 biodegradation experiment the biodegradation condition of the plastic in the aquatic medium was simulated in cell culture flasks with ventilated caps as presented in fig 1 in particular the film strips with or without uv treatment were exposed to four different aquatic mediums milli q water mqw artificial seawater asw artificial seawater with sediment on the bottom asw s and real seawater with sediment sw s three strips and 100 ml of each aquatic medium were placed in one culture flask with a growth area cross section of 75 cm2 real seawater and the sediment were collected from the sea beach at näset gothenburg the west coast of south sweden asw was prepared according to iso19679 2017

the aquatic medium e g for the growth of microorganisms sampling was performed after 3 5 8 and 10 weeks of exposure for the samples without uv treatment and after 5 and 10 weeks for the uv treated samples the exposed film strips were taken from the test vessels and rinsed in deionized water after drying at room temperature the films were collected and stored in a conditioning room 23 c and 50 rh before evaluation and the remaining flasks filled with water were collected and stored in a refrigerator with a temperature of 4 c before further tests the ph of the aquatic environment in the flask during the exposure was measured by a sevencompact ph ion mettler ph meter 2 3 microscopy and morphology characterizations the formed microplastics in the water were directly investigated by placing the flasks under the optical microscope olympus szx16 stereomicroscope equipped with a uc90 camera to quantitatively analyze the formed microplastics 25 ul droplets taken from the flasks were pipetted in wells designed for volumes up to 30 µl and dried in a cleanroom at room temperature for 1 day the evaporated droplet samples were investigated with the optical microscope an upright olympus bx 63 with a cooled color camera olympus dp72 further the morphology of the formed microplastics and the surfaces of the films was also examined in a field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem hitachi s 4800 before sem analysis the samples were coated with palladium using an agar high resolution sputter coater model 208rh 2 4 size exclusion chromatography sec a verotech pl gpc 50 plus system equipped with two plgel 5 μm mixed d 300 7 5 mm2 columns from varian and a pl ri detector was used to analyze the molecular weight of samples chloroform was used as the solvent and pbat solutions with a concentration of ca 1 mg ml were prepared the solutions were filtered through a ptfe filter pore size of 45 μm before the measurement polystyrene standards 160 371 000 g mol with narrow molecular weight distributions were used for the calibration curve 2 5 thermogravimetry tg specimens weighing ca 7 mg were placed in 70 µl alumina crucibles and were tested in a tg dsc 1 instrument mettler toledo switzerland tg curves of the unexposed and exposed samples were obtained at 25 600 c with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 and a nitrogen gas flow rate of 50 ml min 1 2 6 differential scanning calorimetry dsc the glass transition and melting behavior of the unexposed and exposed samples were studied with a mettler toledo dsc 1 calorimeter switzerland samples weighing ca 5 mg were placed in 40 µl aluminum cups the samples were heated from 50 to 180 c at a rate of 10 c min 1 with a nitrogen gas flow rate of 50 ml min 1 the degree of crystallinity was calculated by dividing the melting enthalpy by the melting enthalpy of 100 crystalline pbat i e 114 j g 1 al itry et al 2015 2 7 attenuated total reflectance infrared atr ir spectroscopy the ir spectra of the films were recorded on a thermo nicolet 6700 equipped with a single atr accessory all spectra were recorded between 4000 and 600 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 using 16 scans per sample 2 8 mechanical tests tensile tests on film strips were carried out at 23 1 c and 50 2 5 rh in a zwick model z1 tensile testing machine with a 50 n load cell according to iso 527 the specimens were strained at a crosshead speed of 50 mm min 1 and a gage length of 30 mm specially designed grips with a clamping surface composed of soft elastomer were employed to avoid the fracture of films at the clamping area the strain was calculated as the relative increase in the grip to grip distance young s modulus was determined from the slope in the linear region with the strain range of 1 3 and the tensile strength was reported as the maximum value of the tensile stress 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of microplastic fig 2 and fig s1 show that milli q water had initially a ph of 5 5 while the seawaters showed a higher ph of 8 in the flasks containing pristine pbat or ldpe films the ph of the water in all four cases showed a small extent of fluctuation during the 10 weeks of exposure for all cases of the uv treated pbat films the ph showed a lower value than the corresponding ones without uv pretreatment the ph of the mqw containing the uv treated pbat films showed the greatest decrease from 5 5 unexposed to 4 9 after 5 weeks of exposure approaching 4 5 after 10 weeks of exposure in contrast the water ph of the cases with uv treated ldpe films was essentially similar to the pristine cases figs 3 and 4 show images of the formed microplastics in mqw and asw with pristine and uv treated pbat films after the longest exposure 10 weeks for the cases of pristine pbat films very few particles were observed in the mqw but many fragments appeared in asw this result indicates that the formation of microplastics was faster in asw than in mqw as a polyester pbat undergoes hydrolysis in aquatic environments and the hydrolysis of polyester is faster in basic solutions than in acidic solutions min et al 2020 the asw is weakly basic and the mqw is weakly acidic see fig 2 this suggests that a faster ph dependent hydrolysis process occurred in asw leading to a faster formation of microplastics in asw than in mqw a larger number of fragments were observed in both mqw and asw with the uv treated films than those with pristine pbat films indicating that uv pretreatment promoted the formation process of pbat microplastics in both freshwater and seawater interestingly the fragments had a flocculent shape in mqw compared to a fiber like structure in asw figs 4b 1 and d1 show that the fragments were made up of the aggregates of many small fibers a large number of fibers entangled together and formed large fragments in asw with a length as long as 20 mm figs 4c and d whereas in mqw the fragments were shorter ca 0 7 mm figs 4a and b the microplastic fragments were also observed for the asw s and sw s cases fig s2 they were primarily attached to the sediments on the bottom of the flasks also the water in these two cases became slightly green after 3 weeks of exposure due to the growth of algae which were introduced by the sediment and or the sw the algae were not observed in the mqw and asw cases it was very difficult to further study the formed microplastics in the cases with sediment due to the coexistence of microplastics with salts algae and sediment so the study on the microplastic structure was performed on solely the mqw and asw cases to further reveal the morphology of the formed microplastics during the biodegradation process of pbat the large microplastic fragments observed in fig 3 were taken from the water and dried on glass slides and then observed in sem to avoid the formation of salt crystals during the drying the fragments in asw were placed on a glass slide and rinsed with mqw to remove the salts fiber shaped microplastics were clearly observed in fig 5 the fibers were long above 1 mm and it was even difficult to find both ends of one fiber the fiber shaped microplastics formed in mqw had a diameter in a range of 0 8 to 2 5 μm inset in fig 5a with an average value of 1 8 μm while the fibers in asw showed a smaller average diameter 1 0 μm fig 5d in addition to the fiber shaped microplastics plenty of spherical and rod like shaped microplastics were also observed in fig 5 the spherical microplastics had a diameter of about 3 μm in both mqw figs 5a and b and asw figs 5d and e while the rod like microplastics had a diameter of ca 0 8 μm in both mqw fig 5c and asw fig 5f the microplastics with the fiber spherical and rod like shapes were also observed for the cases without uv pretreatment fig s3 no fragments were observed visually in the waters with ldpe films fig s4 indicating that the formation of microplastics from biodegradable pbat was significantly faster than that from ldpe in aquatic environments however small microplastics formed from ldpe were observed in om fig s5 to compare the microplastics formed from pbat with those from ldpe quantitatively optical microscopy images of residual material after the evaporation of the 25 µl samples were analyzed for particle size size distribution and particle surface coverage percentage in software imagej after the water was evaporated it was difficult to distinguish between plastic fragments and salt crystals in asw samples figs s2 and s5 for this reason the initial evaluation of microplastic content particle sizes and distributions was only performed on the mqw samples figs 6 s6 and s7 show all mqw samples for the plastic films leached for 5 8 and 10 weeks respectively fig 7 a shows that the microplastics formed had an average diameter of 1 3 μm for both ldpe and pbat with and without uv pretreatment fig 7b shows that the relative particle amount was around 4 2 as indicated by the percentage of the area coverage by the particles for ldpe samples after 10 weeks of exposure whereas the corresponding relative particle amount for the pbat sample was much higher reaching 11 this value was 3 4 for the uv aged pbat sample after 10 weeks of aging which was the lowest among the 10 weeks exposed samples what needs to be pointed out is that most of the fiber microplastics aggregating in the large fragments observed in fig 4 were not counted in this analysis because of their uneven dispersion in the water and their large size which could not be pipetted with the small pipette used as mentioned earlier above the uv treated pbat tended to form long fiber shaped fragments while fragments with a flocculent shape with a much smaller size dominated for the non uv treated pbat cases that is why a smaller coverage was observed for the uv treated pbat sample than the non uv treated pbat since there were no visible large fragments formed in ldpe samples it could be concluded that the number of microplastics formed was much greater for pbat samples than ldpe samples 3 2 changes in plastic films to understand the formation of the microplastics in different environments the changes in physicochemical properties of the pbat films during the exposure were systematically studied 3 2 1 sec sec was employed to reveal the changes in the molecular weight of the pbat films during the exposure table 1 fig 8 the weight averaged molecular weight m w was 134 kda for pristine pbat and it fluctuated within the testing error range of sec ca 10 after 10 weeks of exposure to mqw or asw in addition small peaks at the lower molecular weight range ca 600 da were observed for pristine pbat film which was assigned to residual oligomers i e low molecular esters the intensity of the peak at low molecular weight increased after the exposure to mqw significantly indicating the formation of low molecular esters in the film due to hydrolysis the intensity increased only slightly for the asw case the difference in mqw and asw cases was caused by not only their different hydrolysis rate but also the possible different solubility or diffusion rate of low molecular esters the uv treated films could not be fully dissolved in chloroform which was a good solvent for pbat indicating the occurrence of crosslinking of pbat chains during the uv pretreatment under uv exposure pbat undergoes photooxidation which induces both crosslinking and chain scission kijchavengkul et al 2011 the oxidation of pbat films under uv exposure was revealed by the ftir results below therefore only the molecular weight of the soluble parts was measured for all the uv treated samples as shown in table 1 the soluble parts had a much lower m w 17 kda than the pristine film indicating the occurrence of chain scission during the photodegradation also a strong peak around m 600 da was observed suggesting the formation of the lower molecular weight molecules during the uv treatment the molecules which were probably carboxyl terminated esters after the exposure to asw and mqw the peak intensity of the lower molecular weight molecules decreased indicating the migration of these molecules into the water during the exposure 3 2 2 ftir the pbat films displayed only negligible changes in their ir spectra after the exposure in the four different environments for 10 weeks fig s8 however the spectrum of the uv treated film showed a broader carbonyl peak at 1708 cm 1 with one extra shoulder at 1810 1755 cm 1 and another extra shoulder at 1650 1600 cm 1 compared to that of the pristine film fig 9 a during the uv exposure pbat films underwent photooxidation whose products contained carbonyl groups these two shoulders were also observed in the works of kijchavengkul et al 2010a wang et al 2020b and the shoulder at 1650 1600 cm 1 is ascribed to the formation of low molecular weight molecules during the photooxidation the uv treated pbat film also showed a wide shoulder at 3600 3000 cm 1 ascribed to the hydroxyl group indicating the formation of carboxylic acids and alcohol groups during the uv exposure the carbonyl peak of the pristine and uv treated pbat samples was deconvoluted figs 9b and c and the carbonyl groups from the oxidative products in the uv treated pbat film were included in one broad peak peak 4 in fig 9c its integrated area accounted for 28 6 of the entire carbonyl peak this large proportion suggests that the pbat film underwent a large degree of oxidation during the uv exposure after 10 weeks of exposure to mqw these two carbonyl shoulders and the shoulder of the hydroxyl group disappeared indicating that most of the oxidative products migrated from the film into the water this finding agreed well with the sec result the migration of the carbonyl acids accounted for the decrease in the ph of the waters containing uv treated pbat films fig 2a whereas the shoulder at 1810 1755 cm 1 did not disappear for the uv treated pbat films exposed to asw for 10 weeks this was probably due to the formation of the low molecular weight molecules from the hydrolysis of pbat in asw ldpe films showed as expected unchanged ir spectra after 10 weeks of exposure in the four different aquatic environments fig s9 a carbonyl peak at 1722 cm 1 appeared after the uv pretreatment indicating the occurrence of oxidation fig s10 in contrast to the pbat films this carbonyl peak of the uv treated films showed unnoticeable changes after 10 weeks of exposure to both freshwater and seawater fig s10 3 2 3 surface morphology of the films many particles and fibers formed during the film cast extrusion were observed on the pristine pbat film fig 10 a one end of the fiber was bonded to the film the particles were also observed on the surface of the pristine ldpe film fig s11 these particles and fibers could be one of the sources of the formed microplastics in water especially at the very early stage of exposure the particles and fibers were also observed on the surface of the exposed films fig 10b the presence of a long fiber shaped microplastic from the film is observed in figs 10b and c the fiber seemed to be about to debond from the film leaving a ditch on the film surface as known polymer chains are oriented along the extrusion direction after the extrusion which leads to the formation of an oriented structures such as oriented lamellae in the extruded plastic products and a weaker interaction between chains in the direction perpendicular to the extrusion direction in particular these oriented crystal structures are more slowly hydrolyzed than the amorphous structure since the crystals are impenetrable to the aging media water the oriented structures in the pbat film were believed to account for the formation of the long fiber shaped microplastics during the hydrolysis the uv treated film showed more primary particles on the surface than the pristine film which was due to the degradation during the uv treatment a special groove structure was observed on the surface of the uv treated film exposed to mqw for 5 weeks these grooves had a width of 1 20 μm and were parallel to the extrusion direction note that photodegradation is a surface dominated process where the surface undergoes a much higher degree of degradation than the core part kijchavengkul et al 2010a shlyapintokh 1984 the grooves were formed due to the partial loss detachment of a highly degraded surface layer off from the film during the exposure to mqw fig 10f shows that the unfallen part had a corroded surface and had the potential to form the observed spherical microplastics ca 3 μm in diameter figs 5a and b with further exposure to mqw this groove structure was not observed on the surfaces of the uv treated film exposed to asw see fig s12 this was probably due to the faster hydrolysis rate of pbat in asw than in mqw which facilitated the detachment of the highly degraded layer 3 2 4 thermal stability tga was employed to reveal the changes in the thermal stability of pbat films during the exposure here the temperature at 10 mass loss in the tga curves was taken as the initial decomposition temperature t d of the sample table 2 shows that the pristine pbat sample started to decompose at 384 c and the t d of the pbat samples remained unchanged after 10 weeks of exposure to the four different aquatic environments this finding suggests the unchanged thermal stability of pbat during the exposure the t d decreased by 9 c from 384 to 375 c after the uv pretreatment due to photodegradation upon further exposure in the aquatic environments the t d of uv treated film decreased further to 364 c in mqw and to ca 355 c in the three seawater environments as a result the uv treated pbat films exposed to seawater showed a more severe loss in thermal stability than those exposed to mqw 3 2 5 melting behavior crystallinity and glass transition temperature fig 11 shows that the pristine pbat had a glass transition temperature t g of 28 c and two melting peaks at 50 and 113 c respectively the t g two melting peak temperatures t m and crystallinity of the film remained unchanged after 10 weeks of exposure in all aquatic environments see table 3 this result suggests that the exposure conditions i e room temperature in water barely affected the crystallization properties of pbat after 10 weeks of exposure after the uv pretreatment the two melting peaks merged into one melting peak at 98 c this peak merger was due to the shift of the melting peak at the lower temperature towards higher temperatures during the uv treatment noting that the uv treatment was performed at 50 c which was exactly at the lower melting temperature of pbat the crystals were partially melted and re arranged to form crystals with greater thickness and or perfection at this temperature this annealing effect led to an increase in melting temperature leading to the peak merger in addition the crystallinity increased slightly from 22 6 to 23 8 due to the annealing effect furthermore t g increased by 3 c from 28 4 to 25 c after the uv treatment due to crosslinking after 10 weeks of exposure to water the t m of the uv treated pbat increased slightly and the crystallinity remained unchanged for the samples exposed to mqw or sw s however the crystallinity increased significantly from 23 8 to 30 for the samples exposed to asw or asw s this large increase in crystallinity was probably caused by the faster hydrolysis of pbat in asw since the hydrolysis occurred mainly in the amorphous region 3 2 6 mechanical properties tensile tests were performed to reveal the changes in the mechanical properties of pbat and ldpe films during exposure fig 12 shows the tensile stress strain curves of representative samples the young s modulus of the pbat films remained almost constant during the exposure to all four aquatic environments fig s13 the tensile strength and the strain at break also remained unchanged during the exposure except for those exposed to asw which experienced a decreasing trend after exposure fig s13 a tearing type of tensile fracture behavior was observed for most of pbat samples exposed to asw which is discussed in the supporting information the 10 weeks of aging in the different aquatic environments also barely altered the mechanical properties of ldpe as indicated by the unchanged stiffness strength and extensibility fig s14 fig 12 and table 4 show that the uv treatment deteriorated the mechanical properties of pbat significantly as indicated by the 30 70 and 60 reduction in stiffness strength and extensibility respectively kijchavengkul et al kijchavengkul et al 2011 report that the uv exposure reduces the molecular weight of pbat remarkably which in turn deteriorates its mechanical properties the tearing type of fracture behavior was also observed for the uv treated pbat films after 10 weeks of aging fig 12 and the strain at break further decreased from 137 to ca 50 after the exposure in contrast young s modulus of the uv treated pbat films increased after the 10 weeks of exposure particularly young s modulus doubled for the films exposed to asw and asw with sand which was due to the increase in crystallinity after the exposure table 3 compared to the pristine ldpe film the uv treated ldpe film showed a slight increase in stiffness but ca 40 reduction in strength and 30 reduction in extensibility table s1 this result indicates that the effects of the uv exposure on the mechanical properties of the films were less significant on ldpe than on pbat table s1 also shows that the stiffness strength and extensibility of the uv treated ldpe film remained unchanged after further exposure in all aquatic environments for 10 weeks 3 3 toxicity pbat and ldpe have been reported as safe and nontoxic plastics anon 2007 palsikowski et al 2018 palsikowski et al palsikowski et al 2018 report that pbat films do not show any cytotoxic genotoxic and mutagenic effects on meristematic cells of allium cepa however after exposure to uv radiation the small organic low molecular weight molecules including carboxylic acids are formed due to the photooxidation of pbat and these molecules are toxic besides in aquatic environments pbat is hydrolyzed which leads to the formation of monomers adipic acid 1 4 butanediol and terephthalic acid and oligomers low molecular weight esters of pbat before the low molecular weight products from the hydrolysis are metabolized to be mineralized into co2 and h2o they are toxic and pollutants to the environment kim et al 2001 the results above showed the migration of these small molecules into the surrounding water thus polluting it also the formed microplastics are potential pollutants in the same way as other microplastics i e being capable of adsorbing and concentrating polluting substances present in the environment cole et al 2011 ng et al 2018 zuo et al zuo et al 2019 reveal that the sorption capacity of pbat microplastics for phenanthrene an organic pollutant is 3 times that of pe microplastics schöpfer et al schöpfer et al 2020 report that ldpe microplastics and microplastics of pbat pla blend show similar negative effects on the reproduction of nematodes and they conclude that the toxicity risk for conventional and biodegradable microplastic particles is likely to be the same as microplastic toxicity is rather attributable to physical and indirect nutritional effects rather than to chemical effects moreover studies show that microplastics can be ingested by a range of aquatic organisms beiras et al 2018 and can even be incorporated into their circulatory system and accumulate in different tissues fernández and albentosa 2019 for example mak et al mak et al 2019 show the acute toxic effects of pe microplastics on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway disruption of the oogenesis process and neurotoxicity of adult zebrafish and malafaia et al malafaia et al 2020 reveal the sublethal effect of pe microplastics on the larvae of zebrafish nevertheless beiras et al beiras et al 2018 demonstrate that the ingestion and contact with pe microplastics do not cause acute toxicity on marine zooplankton 4 conclusions taking pbat as an example of biodegradable polymers this work demonstrated that large quantities of microplastics can form from biodegradable polymers in aquatic environments under uv or sunlight pbat underwent oxidation leading to both crosslinking and chain scission which in turn promoted the formation of microplastics from the biodegradable polymers the microplastic formation was faster in a seawater environment than in milli q water due to the faster hydrolysis of pbat in basic environments than in acidic ones the formation of microplastics occurred more readily from pbat than conventional non biodegradable ldpe in the aquatic environments before being completely degraded the microplastic would enter the ecosystem and pose the risk to the environment to summarize the results here showed a case where a biodegradable polymer among the most used biodegradable plastics generated more microplastics than a conventional non biodegradable polymer polyethylene is the most

16986,biodegradable polymers have been regarded as a promising solution to tackle the pollutions caused by the wide use of conventional polymers however during the biodegradation process the material fragmentation leads to microplastics in this work the formation of microplastics from biodegradable poly butylene adipate co terephthalate pbat in different aquatic environments was investigated and compared with the common non biodegradable low density polyethylene ldpe the results showed that a much larger quantity of plastic fragments particles were formed in all aquatic environments from pbat than from ldpe in addition uv a pretreatment simulating the exposure to sunlight increased the rate of pbat microplastic formation significantly the size distribution and shapes of the formed microplastics were systematically studied along with changes in the polymer physicochemical properties such as molecular weight thermal stability crystallinity and mechanical properties to reveal the formation process of microplastics this study shows that the microplastic risk from biodegradable polymers is high and needs to be further evaluated with regards to longer timeframes the biological fate of intermediate products and final products in freshwater estuarine and seawater natural habitats especially considering that these microplastics may have good biodegradability in warmer 20 25 water but will most likely be highly persistent in the world s cold deep seas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics biodegradable polymer water pollution poly butylene adipate co terephthalate hydrolysis 1 introduction the wide use of plastics and the lack of proper plastic waste handling has raised many concerns regarding environmental pollution and the accumulation of plastic debris in the world s oceans ateia et al 2020 klingelhofer et al 2020 law 2017 lebreton et al 2017 ó briain et al 2020 ostle et al 2019 degradation rates and half lives of several plastics in natural environments have been estimated recently and for example low density polyethylene ldpe plastic bags 100 µm thick and high density polyethylene plastic bottles 500 µm thick demonstrate half lives of 3 4 and 58 years respectively in marine environments chamas et al 2020 one of the main concerns of plastic pollution is microplastics particle size lower than 5 mm originating from manufacturing plastics primary sources and the degradation of plastic wastes secondary sources cole et al 2011 microplastics are prone to accumulate in the environment and pose a significant risk to ecosystems all over the world andrady 2017 blettler et al 2018 jang et al 2020 lee et al 2020 wagner et al 2018 wang et al 2018 recently the presence of microplastics in even drinking water and bottled water has been recognized koelmans et al 2019 the replacement of conventional non biodegradable polymers with biodegradable polymers has been regarded as a promising solution to tackle the pollution biodegradable polymers often converted from renewable raw materials can break down into low molecular weight compounds such as water methane and carbon dioxide by microorganisms such as bacteria fungi and algae leja and lewandowicz 2010 lucas et al 2008 biodegradable polymers also undergo fragmentation into small particles during the biodegradation break down process and a large number of small plastic particles microplastics are thus formed agarwal 2020 kubowicz and booth 2017 microplastics formed from biodegradable plastic products pose a risk to the environment before being completely degraded besides apart fromapart from biodegradation biodegradable polymers undergo traditional degradation such as oxidation photodegradation weathering aging etc which could accelerate the formation of microplastics kijchavengkul et al 2008 kijchavengkul et al 2010b 2011 sait et al 2020 sørensen et al 2020 wang et al 2020a zhu et al 2020 despite the potential for biodegradation the microplastics formed from biodegradable polymers may have a very long lifetime there are several reasons one is that the biodegradation itself is a time consuming process biodegradability is affected by both biotic and abiotic factors of the environment such as temperature moisture ph bio surfactants and enzymes agarwal 2020 pischedda et al 2019 the ideal conditions are easy to achieve in labs and industrial composting sites but will not be the normal conditions in nature for instance poly lactide acid pla one of the most common biodegradable polymers wei et al 2014 can be rapidly degraded in industrial composting conditions three weeks for pla thin films and six weeks for pla rope weng et al 2013 but undergoes a much slower biodegradation process under natural soil burial conditions rudnik and briassoulis 2011 as a result depending on the type of polymers and their surrounding conditions the microplastics formed from biodegradable polymers can thus be persistent and remain for decades in natural environments kubowicz and booth 2017 when the possible migration from an optimal condition for biodegradation to sub optimal conditions scarce nutrients insufficient water activity low temperature etc caused by environmental factors such as rain wind and tide are considered the lifetime of the formed microplastic may even be much longer furthermore biodegradability is also influenced by polymer characteristics such as crystallinity functional groups and molecular weight pantani et al 2013 tokiwa et al 2009 for semi crystalline polymers the amorphous region is more easily degraded than the crystal region since the crystal structure is less accessible for the aging media such as water oxygen or enzymes alexis 2005 gorrasi et al 2013 mochizuki et al 1995 white et al 2021 consequently the residual microplastic particles will mainly consist of crystallites which will have a much lower biodegradation rate and can thus exist for a long time despite the importance of limiting microplastics from all types of polymers and products very few reports exist on the formation of microplastics from biodegradable plastics agarwal 2020 bagheri et al 2017 kubowicz and booth 2017 weinstein et al 2020 the article aimed to reveal the potential formation of microplastics from biodegradable poly butylene adipate co terephthalate pbat in different aquatic environments at room temperature and to understand the underlying mechanisms pbat having similar mechanical properties as ldpe has been regarded as a promising biodegradable alternative to ldpe especially in disposable products such as mulch films and plastic shopping bags kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 kijchavengkul et al 2010a kijchavengkul et al 2008 kijchavengkul et al 2010b hence the conventional non biodegradable ldpe was selected as a comparison to pbat in this investigation also a uv pretreatment was applied to the plastics to mimic the aging of the plastic products in sunlight before they end up in an aquatic environment the effects of uv in the formation of microplastics in aquatic environments were demonstrated and the morphology of the formed microplastics was studied 2 experimental 2 1 materials and sample preparation pbat having a trademark of ecoflex f blend c1200 and a density of 1260 kg m3 was purchased from basf germany no additives in the pbat were listed in the product datasheet from basf ldpe without additives with a trademark of lupolen 2420 k and a density of 924 kg m3 was purchased from albis sweden the film with a thickness of 20 μm was made with a twin screw extruder brabender 20 40 ls germany using an extrusion temperature profile of 150 250 c from the feeding zone to the film die the film strips 100 20 mm were cut from the extruded film by using a metal template and scalpel one third of the prepared film strips were exposed to uv light at 50 c for 79 h in a quv accelerated weathering tester qpanel lab products cleveland usa to mimic the aging condition of plastic under sunlight the irradiance of the uv light used was 0 76 w m2 at a wavelength of 340 nm representing the long wavelength uva that is barely filtered by the atmosphere approximately 90 of uva from the sun reaching the earth s surface 2 2 biodegradation experiment the biodegradation condition of the plastic in the aquatic medium was simulated in cell culture flasks with ventilated caps as presented in fig 1 in particular the film strips with or without uv treatment were exposed to four different aquatic mediums milli q water mqw artificial seawater asw artificial seawater with sediment on the bottom asw s and real seawater with sediment sw s three strips and 100 ml of each aquatic medium were placed in one culture flask with a growth area cross section of 75 cm2 real seawater and the sediment were collected from the sea beach at näset gothenburg the west coast of south sweden asw was prepared according to iso19679 2017

the aquatic medium e g for the growth of microorganisms sampling was performed after 3 5 8 and 10 weeks of exposure for the samples without uv treatment and after 5 and 10 weeks for the uv treated samples the exposed film strips were taken from the test vessels and rinsed in deionized water after drying at room temperature the films were collected and stored in a conditioning room 23 c and 50 rh before evaluation and the remaining flasks filled with water were collected and stored in a refrigerator with a temperature of 4 c before further tests the ph of the aquatic environment in the flask during the exposure was measured by a sevencompact ph ion mettler ph meter 2 3 microscopy and morphology characterizations the formed microplastics in the water were directly investigated by placing the flasks under the optical microscope olympus szx16 stereomicroscope equipped with a uc90 camera to quantitatively analyze the formed microplastics 25 ul droplets taken from the flasks were pipetted in wells designed for volumes up to 30 µl and dried in a cleanroom at room temperature for 1 day the evaporated droplet samples were investigated with the optical microscope an upright olympus bx 63 with a cooled color camera olympus dp72 further the morphology of the formed microplastics and the surfaces of the films was also examined in a field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem hitachi s 4800 before sem analysis the samples were coated with palladium using an agar high resolution sputter coater model 208rh 2 4 size exclusion chromatography sec a verotech pl gpc 50 plus system equipped with two plgel 5 μm mixed d 300 7 5 mm2 columns from varian and a pl ri detector was used to analyze the molecular weight of samples chloroform was used as the solvent and pbat solutions with a concentration of ca 1 mg ml were prepared the solutions were filtered through a ptfe filter pore size of 45 μm before the measurement polystyrene standards 160 371 000 g mol with narrow molecular weight distributions were used for the calibration curve 2 5 thermogravimetry tg specimens weighing ca 7 mg were placed in 70 µl alumina crucibles and were tested in a tg dsc 1 instrument mettler toledo switzerland tg curves of the unexposed and exposed samples were obtained at 25 600 c with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 and a nitrogen gas flow rate of 50 ml min 1 2 6 differential scanning calorimetry dsc the glass transition and melting behavior of the unexposed and exposed samples were studied with a mettler toledo dsc 1 calorimeter switzerland samples weighing ca 5 mg were placed in 40 µl aluminum cups the samples were heated from 50 to 180 c at a rate of 10 c min 1 with a nitrogen gas flow rate of 50 ml min 1 the degree of crystallinity was calculated by dividing the melting enthalpy by the melting enthalpy of 100 crystalline pbat i e 114 j g 1 al itry et al 2015 2 7 attenuated total reflectance infrared atr ir spectroscopy the ir spectra of the films were recorded on a thermo nicolet 6700 equipped with a single atr accessory all spectra were recorded between 4000 and 600 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 using 16 scans per sample 2 8 mechanical tests tensile tests on film strips were carried out at 23 1 c and 50 2 5 rh in a zwick model z1 tensile testing machine with a 50 n load cell according to iso 527 the specimens were strained at a crosshead speed of 50 mm min 1 and a gage length of 30 mm specially designed grips with a clamping surface composed of soft elastomer were employed to avoid the fracture of films at the clamping area the strain was calculated as the relative increase in the grip to grip distance young s modulus was determined from the slope in the linear region with the strain range of 1 3 and the tensile strength was reported as the maximum value of the tensile stress 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of microplastic fig 2 and fig s1 show that milli q water had initially a ph of 5 5 while the seawaters showed a higher ph of 8 in the flasks containing pristine pbat or ldpe films the ph of the water in all four cases showed a small extent of fluctuation during the 10 weeks of exposure for all cases of the uv treated pbat films the ph showed a lower value than the corresponding ones without uv pretreatment the ph of the mqw containing the uv treated pbat films showed the greatest decrease from 5 5 unexposed to 4 9 after 5 weeks of exposure approaching 4 5 after 10 weeks of exposure in contrast the water ph of the cases with uv treated ldpe films was essentially similar to the pristine cases figs 3 and 4 show images of the formed microplastics in mqw and asw with pristine and uv treated pbat films after the longest exposure 10 weeks for the cases of pristine pbat films very few particles were observed in the mqw but many fragments appeared in asw this result indicates that the formation of microplastics was faster in asw than in mqw as a polyester pbat undergoes hydrolysis in aquatic environments and the hydrolysis of polyester is faster in basic solutions than in acidic solutions min et al 2020 the asw is weakly basic and the mqw is weakly acidic see fig 2 this suggests that a faster ph dependent hydrolysis process occurred in asw leading to a faster formation of microplastics in asw than in mqw a larger number of fragments were observed in both mqw and asw with the uv treated films than those with pristine pbat films indicating that uv pretreatment promoted the formation process of pbat microplastics in both freshwater and seawater interestingly the fragments had a flocculent shape in mqw compared to a fiber like structure in asw figs 4b 1 and d1 show that the fragments were made up of the aggregates of many small fibers a large number of fibers entangled together and formed large fragments in asw with a length as long as 20 mm figs 4c and d whereas in mqw the fragments were shorter ca 0 7 mm figs 4a and b the microplastic fragments were also observed for the asw s and sw s cases fig s2 they were primarily attached to the sediments on the bottom of the flasks also the water in these two cases became slightly green after 3 weeks of exposure due to the growth of algae which were introduced by the sediment and or the sw the algae were not observed in the mqw and asw cases it was very difficult to further study the formed microplastics in the cases with sediment due to the coexistence of microplastics with salts algae and sediment so the study on the microplastic structure was performed on solely the mqw and asw cases to further reveal the morphology of the formed microplastics during the biodegradation process of pbat the large microplastic fragments observed in fig 3 were taken from the water and dried on glass slides and then observed in sem to avoid the formation of salt crystals during the drying the fragments in asw were placed on a glass slide and rinsed with mqw to remove the salts fiber shaped microplastics were clearly observed in fig 5 the fibers were long above 1 mm and it was even difficult to find both ends of one fiber the fiber shaped microplastics formed in mqw had a diameter in a range of 0 8 to 2 5 μm inset in fig 5a with an average value of 1 8 μm while the fibers in asw showed a smaller average diameter 1 0 μm fig 5d in addition to the fiber shaped microplastics plenty of spherical and rod like shaped microplastics were also observed in fig 5 the spherical microplastics had a diameter of about 3 μm in both mqw figs 5a and b and asw figs 5d and e while the rod like microplastics had a diameter of ca 0 8 μm in both mqw fig 5c and asw fig 5f the microplastics with the fiber spherical and rod like shapes were also observed for the cases without uv pretreatment fig s3 no fragments were observed visually in the waters with ldpe films fig s4 indicating that the formation of microplastics from biodegradable pbat was significantly faster than that from ldpe in aquatic environments however small microplastics formed from ldpe were observed in om fig s5 to compare the microplastics formed from pbat with those from ldpe quantitatively optical microscopy images of residual material after the evaporation of the 25 µl samples were analyzed for particle size size distribution and particle surface coverage percentage in software imagej after the water was evaporated it was difficult to distinguish between plastic fragments and salt crystals in asw samples figs s2 and s5 for this reason the initial evaluation of microplastic content particle sizes and distributions was only performed on the mqw samples figs 6 s6 and s7 show all mqw samples for the plastic films leached for 5 8 and 10 weeks respectively fig 7 a shows that the microplastics formed had an average diameter of 1 3 μm for both ldpe and pbat with and without uv pretreatment fig 7b shows that the relative particle amount was around 4 2 as indicated by the percentage of the area coverage by the particles for ldpe samples after 10 weeks of exposure whereas the corresponding relative particle amount for the pbat sample was much higher reaching 11 this value was 3 4 for the uv aged pbat sample after 10 weeks of aging which was the lowest among the 10 weeks exposed samples what needs to be pointed out is that most of the fiber microplastics aggregating in the large fragments observed in fig 4 were not counted in this analysis because of their uneven dispersion in the water and their large size which could not be pipetted with the small pipette used as mentioned earlier above the uv treated pbat tended to form long fiber shaped fragments while fragments with a flocculent shape with a much smaller size dominated for the non uv treated pbat cases that is why a smaller coverage was observed for the uv treated pbat sample than the non uv treated pbat since there were no visible large fragments formed in ldpe samples it could be concluded that the number of microplastics formed was much greater for pbat samples than ldpe samples 3 2 changes in plastic films to understand the formation of the microplastics in different environments the changes in physicochemical properties of the pbat films during the exposure were systematically studied 3 2 1 sec sec was employed to reveal the changes in the molecular weight of the pbat films during the exposure table 1 fig 8 the weight averaged molecular weight m w was 134 kda for pristine pbat and it fluctuated within the testing error range of sec ca 10 after 10 weeks of exposure to mqw or asw in addition small peaks at the lower molecular weight range ca 600 da were observed for pristine pbat film which was assigned to residual oligomers i e low molecular esters the intensity of the peak at low molecular weight increased after the exposure to mqw significantly indicating the formation of low molecular esters in the film due to hydrolysis the intensity increased only slightly for the asw case the difference in mqw and asw cases was caused by not only their different hydrolysis rate but also the possible different solubility or diffusion rate of low molecular esters the uv treated films could not be fully dissolved in chloroform which was a good solvent for pbat indicating the occurrence of crosslinking of pbat chains during the uv pretreatment under uv exposure pbat undergoes photooxidation which induces both crosslinking and chain scission kijchavengkul et al 2011 the oxidation of pbat films under uv exposure was revealed by the ftir results below therefore only the molecular weight of the soluble parts was measured for all the uv treated samples as shown in table 1 the soluble parts had a much lower m w 17 kda than the pristine film indicating the occurrence of chain scission during the photodegradation also a strong peak around m 600 da was observed suggesting the formation of the lower molecular weight molecules during the uv treatment the molecules which were probably carboxyl terminated esters after the exposure to asw and mqw the peak intensity of the lower molecular weight molecules decreased indicating the migration of these molecules into the water during the exposure 3 2 2 ftir the pbat films displayed only negligible changes in their ir spectra after the exposure in the four different environments for 10 weeks fig s8 however the spectrum of the uv treated film showed a broader carbonyl peak at 1708 cm 1 with one extra shoulder at 1810 1755 cm 1 and another extra shoulder at 1650 1600 cm 1 compared to that of the pristine film fig 9 a during the uv exposure pbat films underwent photooxidation whose products contained carbonyl groups these two shoulders were also observed in the works of kijchavengkul et al 2010a wang et al 2020b and the shoulder at 1650 1600 cm 1 is ascribed to the formation of low molecular weight molecules during the photooxidation the uv treated pbat film also showed a wide shoulder at 3600 3000 cm 1 ascribed to the hydroxyl group indicating the formation of carboxylic acids and alcohol groups during the uv exposure the carbonyl peak of the pristine and uv treated pbat samples was deconvoluted figs 9b and c and the carbonyl groups from the oxidative products in the uv treated pbat film were included in one broad peak peak 4 in fig 9c its integrated area accounted for 28 6 of the entire carbonyl peak this large proportion suggests that the pbat film underwent a large degree of oxidation during the uv exposure after 10 weeks of exposure to mqw these two carbonyl shoulders and the shoulder of the hydroxyl group disappeared indicating that most of the oxidative products migrated from the film into the water this finding agreed well with the sec result the migration of the carbonyl acids accounted for the decrease in the ph of the waters containing uv treated pbat films fig 2a whereas the shoulder at 1810 1755 cm 1 did not disappear for the uv treated pbat films exposed to asw for 10 weeks this was probably due to the formation of the low molecular weight molecules from the hydrolysis of pbat in asw ldpe films showed as expected unchanged ir spectra after 10 weeks of exposure in the four different aquatic environments fig s9 a carbonyl peak at 1722 cm 1 appeared after the uv pretreatment indicating the occurrence of oxidation fig s10 in contrast to the pbat films this carbonyl peak of the uv treated films showed unnoticeable changes after 10 weeks of exposure to both freshwater and seawater fig s10 3 2 3 surface morphology of the films many particles and fibers formed during the film cast extrusion were observed on the pristine pbat film fig 10 a one end of the fiber was bonded to the film the particles were also observed on the surface of the pristine ldpe film fig s11 these particles and fibers could be one of the sources of the formed microplastics in water especially at the very early stage of exposure the particles and fibers were also observed on the surface of the exposed films fig 10b the presence of a long fiber shaped microplastic from the film is observed in figs 10b and c the fiber seemed to be about to debond from the film leaving a ditch on the film surface as known polymer chains are oriented along the extrusion direction after the extrusion which leads to the formation of an oriented structures such as oriented lamellae in the extruded plastic products and a weaker interaction between chains in the direction perpendicular to the extrusion direction in particular these oriented crystal structures are more slowly hydrolyzed than the amorphous structure since the crystals are impenetrable to the aging media water the oriented structures in the pbat film were believed to account for the formation of the long fiber shaped microplastics during the hydrolysis the uv treated film showed more primary particles on the surface than the pristine film which was due to the degradation during the uv treatment a special groove structure was observed on the surface of the uv treated film exposed to mqw for 5 weeks these grooves had a width of 1 20 μm and were parallel to the extrusion direction note that photodegradation is a surface dominated process where the surface undergoes a much higher degree of degradation than the core part kijchavengkul et al 2010a shlyapintokh 1984 the grooves were formed due to the partial loss detachment of a highly degraded surface layer off from the film during the exposure to mqw fig 10f shows that the unfallen part had a corroded surface and had the potential to form the observed spherical microplastics ca 3 μm in diameter figs 5a and b with further exposure to mqw this groove structure was not observed on the surfaces of the uv treated film exposed to asw see fig s12 this was probably due to the faster hydrolysis rate of pbat in asw than in mqw which facilitated the detachment of the highly degraded layer 3 2 4 thermal stability tga was employed to reveal the changes in the thermal stability of pbat films during the exposure here the temperature at 10 mass loss in the tga curves was taken as the initial decomposition temperature t d of the sample table 2 shows that the pristine pbat sample started to decompose at 384 c and the t d of the pbat samples remained unchanged after 10 weeks of exposure to the four different aquatic environments this finding suggests the unchanged thermal stability of pbat during the exposure the t d decreased by 9 c from 384 to 375 c after the uv pretreatment due to photodegradation upon further exposure in the aquatic environments the t d of uv treated film decreased further to 364 c in mqw and to ca 355 c in the three seawater environments as a result the uv treated pbat films exposed to seawater showed a more severe loss in thermal stability than those exposed to mqw 3 2 5 melting behavior crystallinity and glass transition temperature fig 11 shows that the pristine pbat had a glass transition temperature t g of 28 c and two melting peaks at 50 and 113 c respectively the t g two melting peak temperatures t m and crystallinity of the film remained unchanged after 10 weeks of exposure in all aquatic environments see table 3 this result suggests that the exposure conditions i e room temperature in water barely affected the crystallization properties of pbat after 10 weeks of exposure after the uv pretreatment the two melting peaks merged into one melting peak at 98 c this peak merger was due to the shift of the melting peak at the lower temperature towards higher temperatures during the uv treatment noting that the uv treatment was performed at 50 c which was exactly at the lower melting temperature of pbat the crystals were partially melted and re arranged to form crystals with greater thickness and or perfection at this temperature this annealing effect led to an increase in melting temperature leading to the peak merger in addition the crystallinity increased slightly from 22 6 to 23 8 due to the annealing effect furthermore t g increased by 3 c from 28 4 to 25 c after the uv treatment due to crosslinking after 10 weeks of exposure to water the t m of the uv treated pbat increased slightly and the crystallinity remained unchanged for the samples exposed to mqw or sw s however the crystallinity increased significantly from 23 8 to 30 for the samples exposed to asw or asw s this large increase in crystallinity was probably caused by the faster hydrolysis of pbat in asw since the hydrolysis occurred mainly in the amorphous region 3 2 6 mechanical properties tensile tests were performed to reveal the changes in the mechanical properties of pbat and ldpe films during exposure fig 12 shows the tensile stress strain curves of representative samples the young s modulus of the pbat films remained almost constant during the exposure to all four aquatic environments fig s13 the tensile strength and the strain at break also remained unchanged during the exposure except for those exposed to asw which experienced a decreasing trend after exposure fig s13 a tearing type of tensile fracture behavior was observed for most of pbat samples exposed to asw which is discussed in the supporting information the 10 weeks of aging in the different aquatic environments also barely altered the mechanical properties of ldpe as indicated by the unchanged stiffness strength and extensibility fig s14 fig 12 and table 4 show that the uv treatment deteriorated the mechanical properties of pbat significantly as indicated by the 30 70 and 60 reduction in stiffness strength and extensibility respectively kijchavengkul et al kijchavengkul et al 2011 report that the uv exposure reduces the molecular weight of pbat remarkably which in turn deteriorates its mechanical properties the tearing type of fracture behavior was also observed for the uv treated pbat films after 10 weeks of aging fig 12 and the strain at break further decreased from 137 to ca 50 after the exposure in contrast young s modulus of the uv treated pbat films increased after the 10 weeks of exposure particularly young s modulus doubled for the films exposed to asw and asw with sand which was due to the increase in crystallinity after the exposure table 3 compared to the pristine ldpe film the uv treated ldpe film showed a slight increase in stiffness but ca 40 reduction in strength and 30 reduction in extensibility table s1 this result indicates that the effects of the uv exposure on the mechanical properties of the films were less significant on ldpe than on pbat table s1 also shows that the stiffness strength and extensibility of the uv treated ldpe film remained unchanged after further exposure in all aquatic environments for 10 weeks 3 3 toxicity pbat and ldpe have been reported as safe and nontoxic plastics anon 2007 palsikowski et al 2018 palsikowski et al palsikowski et al 2018 report that pbat films do not show any cytotoxic genotoxic and mutagenic effects on meristematic cells of allium cepa however after exposure to uv radiation the small organic low molecular weight molecules including carboxylic acids are formed due to the photooxidation of pbat and these molecules are toxic besides in aquatic environments pbat is hydrolyzed which leads to the formation of monomers adipic acid 1 4 butanediol and terephthalic acid and oligomers low molecular weight esters of pbat before the low molecular weight products from the hydrolysis are metabolized to be mineralized into co2 and h2o they are toxic and pollutants to the environment kim et al 2001 the results above showed the migration of these small molecules into the surrounding water thus polluting it also the formed microplastics are potential pollutants in the same way as other microplastics i e being capable of adsorbing and concentrating polluting substances present in the environment cole et al 2011 ng et al 2018 zuo et al zuo et al 2019 reveal that the sorption capacity of pbat microplastics for phenanthrene an organic pollutant is 3 times that of pe microplastics schöpfer et al schöpfer et al 2020 report that ldpe microplastics and microplastics of pbat pla blend show similar negative effects on the reproduction of nematodes and they conclude that the toxicity risk for conventional and biodegradable microplastic particles is likely to be the same as microplastic toxicity is rather attributable to physical and indirect nutritional effects rather than to chemical effects moreover studies show that microplastics can be ingested by a range of aquatic organisms beiras et al 2018 and can even be incorporated into their circulatory system and accumulate in different tissues fernández and albentosa 2019 for example mak et al mak et al 2019 show the acute toxic effects of pe microplastics on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway disruption of the oogenesis process and neurotoxicity of adult zebrafish and malafaia et al malafaia et al 2020 reveal the sublethal effect of pe microplastics on the larvae of zebrafish nevertheless beiras et al beiras et al 2018 demonstrate that the ingestion and contact with pe microplastics do not cause acute toxicity on marine zooplankton 4 conclusions taking pbat as an example of biodegradable polymers this work demonstrated that large quantities of microplastics can form from biodegradable polymers in aquatic environments under uv or sunlight pbat underwent oxidation leading to both crosslinking and chain scission which in turn promoted the formation of microplastics from the biodegradable polymers the microplastic formation was faster in a seawater environment than in milli q water due to the faster hydrolysis of pbat in basic environments than in acidic ones the formation of microplastics occurred more readily from pbat than conventional non biodegradable ldpe in the aquatic environments before being completely degraded the microplastic would enter the ecosystem and pose the risk to the environment to summarize the results here showed a case where a biodegradable polymer among the most used biodegradable plastics generated more microplastics than a conventional non biodegradable polymer polyethylene is the most

16987,low efficiency in energy conversion has long been the bottleneck in sonochemistry based water treatment technologies in this work we reported a simple and efficient strategy by introducing mechanical agitation into a low powered ultrasonic system to facilitate the production of cavitation bubbles the coupled system remarkably intensifies the evolution of reactive oxygen species ros for degradation of refractory organic pollutants we in situ monitored the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh by selective scavenging tests and chemical trapping experiments the operational factors such as rotation speed gas atmosphere solution temperature and ph were carefully evaluated for their impacts on the degradation of a plastic microcontaminant diethyl phthalate dep it was found that the degradation efficiency is closely related to the population of cavitation bubbles in the solution which was collaboratively governed by the aforementioned factors a high mechanical agitation speed 600 rpm great solubility of inert gas atmosphere argon and low reaction temperature 15 ºc are beneficial to the generation of cavitation bubbles and the associated production of ros this work shows a facile strategy to intensify the mechanical energy to chemical conversion and provides new mechanistic insights into the ultrasound based advanced oxidation without external chemical inputs graphical

loomis richards and loomis 1927 first used ultrasound to create cavitation phenomenon for solution degassing and acceleration of chemical reactions in recent decades sonication has been used for direct mineralization of aqueous organic pollutants owing to the advantages of operational simplicity safety and environmental friendliness balachandran et al 2016 hua and hoffmann 1996 serna galvis et al 2015 it is well accepted that sonochemistry originates from the acoustic cavitation in ultrasonically irradiated liquids briggs 1990 suslick 1986 in a sparse half cycle negative pressures are established inside the liquid when the ultrasonic intensity is high enough the average distances between molecules will change and exceed the critical value of the liquid molecular distance and then the gravity between the liquid molecules is demolished and cavitation bubbles are formed the acoustic cavitation processes include the nucleation growth and rapid collapse of microbubbles leading to the emission of sonoluminescence sl and the creation of a hot spot suslick et al 1986 in the hot spot theory when the cavitation bubble collapses the hot spot with ultrahigh temperature up to 5000 k inside the bubble and 1900 k at the interface and pressure up to 1000 atm is instantaneously generated in extremely short time as a result the surrounding water molecules are directly dissociated into highly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals oh 2 7 v which can be utilized to in situ degrade the organic pollutants in the solution due to the physical properties of hot spot and the generation of oh sonication has certain advantages over other advanced oxidation processes aops boczkaj and fernandes 2017 chen and huang 2015 liu et al 2013 wols and hofman caris 2012 in a homogeneous sonication reaction the nucleation process starts from the microscaled gas voids generated from the thermal fluctuations in the bulk solution however the degradation efficiency of the homogeneous sonication is typically very slow because of the inefficient conversion of sono energy in producing ultrasonic cavitation and difficulties in upscaling the achievement of a high degradation rate by ultrasound alone normally requires a significantly high input of electrical energy owing to the massive energy loss during thermal dissipation mahamuni and adewuyi 2010 to this end researchers are circumventing these difficulties using hybrid techniques for wastewater treatment assisted with ultrasound chen and smirniotis 2002 entezari and petrier 2005 fedorov et al 2020 gogate 2008 lesko et al 2006 namkung et al 2008 the use of heterogeneous sonocatalysts is one of the most promising strategies the presence of a heterogeneous sonocatalyst can reduce the energy barrier during the formation of cavitation bubbles doktycz and suslick 1990 shchukin et al 2011 however the heterogeneous nucleation is still challenging in the complexity of material fabrication which requires a porous architecture with optimal pore sizes qiu et al 2018 ultrasonic irradiation will cause continuous micro pitting on the solid surface of the catalyst which severely affects the lifetime and subsequent recovery of the material for multiple uses all these factors limit the application of ultrasonication in environmental remediation apart from the way of generating cavitation bubbles hydrodynamic cavitation hc and hc based aops have also been developed rapidly in recent years cako et al 2020 gagol et al 2020 2018 in hc gas bubbles are generated by special design of reactors or flow systems forcing a liquid to flow under reduced pressure this involves the creation of a local drop in static pressure of a liquid below the critical value by a local increase in flow rate or change in external conditions such as flow line curvature detachment of liquid stream from the side of the container or channel constrictions vortex based hc reactors are an important part of hc reactors sun et al 2021 wang and zhang 2009 this type of reactors does not require much operating and maintenance cost zhang et al 2019 reported the degradation of rhodamine b by vortex scattering ultrasound in aqueous solution however the key issues are not addressed including the identification of reactive oxygen species ros the existence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the factors influencing the population of cavitation bubbles as well as the underlining mechanisms in this work mechanical agitation was innovatively applied to intensify the efficiency of ultrasonic irradiation for the degradation of aqueous organic pollutants without the presences of oxidants or catalysts showing excellent efficiencies in removal of different structured organics this strategy is simple and easy to implement which not only greatly improved the efficiency of homogeneous ultrasound system but also overcame many issues of heterogeneous sonocatalysts such as poor mechanical stability and low separation efficiency we monitored the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 by tert butanol tba quenching and p phthalic acid ta capturing experiments respectively moreover we comprehensively investigated the effects of mechanical agitation speed gas atmosphere solution temperature and initial solution ph on the oxidation efficiency of the integrated system an emerging plastic mediated micropollutant diethyl phthalate dep was used as the model contaminant a low power and low frequency ultrasonic cleaner was used to reduce energy consumption which is different from the previous studies conducted under the probe of cell crusher with a high energy power and operated discontinuously in short time therefore this study proposed a facile and efficient ultrasonication system coupled with mechanical agitation

which was monitored by the absorption of the solution at 551 nm and determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of dep dmp ibp ba bpa rhb nb smx and cv were

identification of the active radicals of the ultrasonic degradation process 10 20 and 40 mm tba was added to the reaction solution as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals oh furthermore 20 μm terephthalic acid ta was used as a probe molecule to detect oh ta has been extensively used for the detection of hydroxyl radicals generated in water producing 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid taoh 3 results and discussion 3 1 mechanical agitation accelerated ultrasonic degradation process ultrasonic irradiation with a fixed low frequency 40 khz and low power 100 w was used to trigger the ultrasonic degradation of pollutants in this investigation fig 1 a shows that sole ultrasonication or mechanical agitation cannot remove dep however in the coupled system ultrasonication with mechanical agitation dep can be effectively degraded within 90 min with a high removal efficiency of 95 additionally the combined system is capable of degrading a diversity of organic pollutants such as organic dyes rhodamine b rhb and crystal violet cv pharmaceutical and personal care products ibuprofen ibp sulfamethoxazole smx and benzoic acid ba and endocrine disrupting chemicals bisphenol a bpa dimethyl phthalate dmp and nitrobenzene nb in figure s2 as displayed in the inset figure in fig 1 a dep degradation followed the pseudo first order kinetics the rate constant k of the combined system is 0 036 0 002 min 1 which is 156 times greater than the single ultrasound system k 0 023 0 017 10 2 min 1 we also compared the degradation efficiencies and rate constant values with some aops for the degradation of dep table s2 further confirming the advantages of the combined system theoretically when ultrasonic waves are applied to the aqueous solution the induced cavitation will simultaneously generate hot spots to produce oh via water pyrolysis or direct high temperature pyrolysis of the volatile organic pollutants in the interior of the hot bubbles however as we mentioned above the energy barrier of cavitation bubbles generated by sole ultrasound is relatively high especially using a low power ultrasonic source therefore the organic cannot be decomposed under sole ultrasonic irradiation in this system the standard theory balibar and caupin 2003 assumes that in the liquid solution under a negative pressure p the cavitation results from the nucleation of a spherical bubble with a radius r and a thin wall the energy of the bubble equals to the macroscopic surface tension σ the free energy f r of this bubble is 1 f r 4 π r 2 σ 4 3 π r 3 p where the first term 4πr2σ is a surface cost and the second item 4πr3p 3 is a gain in volume energy f r reaches a maximum value e for a critical radius r c 2σ p and the e is defined as the energy barrier against nucleation given by 2 e 16 π σ 3 3 p 2 according to the experimental results the energy generated by the ultrasound wave in a single ultrasonic system cannot reach the threshold for generating cavitation bubbles thus the mechanical agitation remarkably lowers the threshold to initiate the bubble nucleation in the combined system as discussed below the performances of ultrasonic degradation of dep were further shown in fig 1 b with different agitation speeds from 100 to 700 rpm at an increasing step of 100 rpm the removal of dep was greatly promoted at an increased agitation speed from 100 to 500 rpm indicating a great increase of cavitation bubbles in the system when the agitation speed reached 600 rpm the increase of the removal efficiency and rate constant for the degradation of dep was less significant we calculated the reynolds number of the system during agitation table s3 when the agitation speed is 100 rpm the reynolds number of the system is 2666 which is in the transitional period of a laminar flow and turbulent flow and no vortex can be formed when the agitation speed is 200 rpm the reynolds number of the system has reached 5333 which is a turbulent flow to form stable vortex theoretically for a stirred vessel the system is fully turbulent for values of re above 10 000 jarman 1959 this may be why the removal efficiency of dep by the system does not increase obviously when the agitation speed exceeds 500 rpm re 10 000 as shown in fig 2 the first contribution of mechanical agitation is the generation of vortex cavitation normally occurs in flowing liquids because the hydrodynamics will result in regions where the pressure falls below the vapor pressure brennen 2014 reynolds 1873 was the pioneer to investigate the unusual behavior of ship propellers at high rotation speeds when the impeller rotates the liquid around the impeller flows at a high speed then vortex will appear locally and the air pressure in the vortex region is simultaneously decreased when the pressure of the vortex area drops to the saturated vapor pressure at the local temperature water begins to vaporize meanwhile the dissolved gas and vapor in water will escape and then cavitation bubbles can be formed in the vortex region we believe that the mechanical agitation will play the similar role to the propeller in creating regional vortex in the system to facilitate the formation of cavitation bubbles in addition mechanical agitation contributes to the heterogeneous nucleation by the impeller the heterogeneous nucleation originates from the presence of sub microscopic air pockets at the solid liquid interface on the solid surface heterogeneous nucleation at a wettable surface occurs if the surface tension of the solid vapor interface σs is smaller than the surface tension of the vapor liquid interface σ at this condition the critical energy will be represented by eq 3 3 e 16 π σ 3 3 p 2 g where 4 g 1 4 2 cos θ 1 cos θ 2 the parameter g is a shape factor of the gas bubble on the surface moreover the teflon coated impeller used in this study can also intensify the heterogeneous nucleation process figure s3 this process is similar to the nucleation of cavitation bubbles on a solid surface in a heterogeneous ultrasonic system the mechanical agitation may also impact the spatial distribution of the field of ultrasound zhang et al 2019 studied the distribution of sound pressure in a transient mode using comsol s pressure acoustic module and found that the sound pressure is higher with the presence of mechanical stirring than the control group with ultrasound only for the formation of a bubble under ultrasound a pressure p has to perform work on the gas with a volume vb the pressure p the difference from the outside hydrostatic pressure of the liquid can be calculated by the following equation shchukin et al 2011 5 p p a p g p v where p g is the partial pressure of possible entrapped gas p v is the partial pressure of vaporized liquid and p a is the largest contribution being the acoustic pressure upon rarefaction obviously an increase of p a will increase p eq 5 and reduce the critical energy of e eqs 2 and 3 herein lowering the energy threshold for generating cavitation bubbles the increase of sound field pressure not only facilitates the cavitation in the vortex region and the impeller region but also reduces the energy threshold of the sole acoustic cavitation to the point where cavitation bubbles can be generated in conclusion due to the strong synergy caused by mechanical agitation a greater population of cavitation bubbles are generated these cavitation bubbles undergo growth and collapse under ultrasound irradiation generating a myriad of hot spots for water dissociation and ultimately producing more ros for pollutant oxidation 3 2 identification of hydroxyl radicals and production of hydrogen peroxide ultrasound will cause the decomposition of water vapor in the generated cavitation bubbles with high temperature and pressure and the reaction can be described as eq 6 makino et al 1983 6 h 2 o sonolysis h oh after the initial cleavage of h2o 80 of oh and h are reported to recombine into water in the cavity fischer et al 1986 the net quantity of oh produced in the gas filled cavity may diffuse to the gas liquid interfacial region to form hydrogen peroxide via eq 7 buxton et al 1988 7 oh oh h 2 o 2 2 k 1 1 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 if oxygen is presented in the vapor phase of the bubble it may react with h to produce ho2 via eq 8 buxton et al 1988 the self reaction of two ho2 at the ambient temperature also produces h2o2 via eq 9 buxton et al 1988 8 o 2 h h o 2 k 2 2 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 9 h o 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 k 3 8 3 10 5 m 1 s 1 in addition to reacting with h to produce ho2 oxygen can also directly participate in supercritical water oxidation reactions wang et al 2019 in sonication process water is in the supercritical state in the transition zone between bubbles and solution and the supercritical water has the same diffusion coefficient as gas 10 100 times higher than the ambient liquid and a lower viscosity meanwhile the water in the supercritical state has the same density as liquid but greater solubility than the adventitious substances aqueous non volatile organic compounds are soluble in supercritical water and can react with the dissolved oxidants such as air and oxygen wang et al 2019 possible reaction processes are shown in eqs 10 13 10 rh o 2 r h o 2 11 rh h o 2 r h 2 o 2 12 r o 2 roo 13 roo rh rooh r in this section we experimentally investigated the formation of oh and assessed the contribution of air or oxygen to dep degradation tba is a specific radical scavenger for oh because of the rapid rate constant 6 0 108 m 1s 1 as shown in fig 3 a the increased concentration of tba resulted in deteriorated dep degradation in the coupled system the pseudo first order kinetic rate constant of dep degradation in the presence of 10 mm tba was 0 006 0 002 min 1 which was 6 times lower than the corresponding value in the control experiment 0 036 0 002 min 1 a higher dose of tba 40 mm almost inhibited dep degradation the removal efficiency decreased to 6 7 with a pseudo first order kinetic rate constant of 0 007 0 001 10 1 min 1 which was 51 4 times lower than that of the control experiment the tba quenching tests indicated that oh is the dominant ros in the coupled system in evaluation of the contribution of dissolved oxygen do high purity argon was continuously bubbled into the system to remove do as shown in fig 3 a dep degradation was not affected by argon purging and the removal efficiency was similar to the original rate therefore the dissolved oxygen did not participate in the evolution of ros or contribute to the degradation of dep a chemical probe p phthalic acid ta 50 μm was used to detect hydroxyl radicals because the hydroxyl radicals can react with ta to generate a characteristic product of 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid taoh which can be detected by hplc yang et al 2020 fig 3 b shows that taoh was gradually generated while ta was degraded nearly 80 of the removed ta 18 μm were converted and 12 μm taoh was generated in 90 min figure s4 which directly proved the existence of hydroxyl radicals in the coupled system the relative low content of taoh could be attributed to its further decomposition by the excessive ros fig 3 c shows the formation of h2o2 in different systems the concentration of h2o2 was calibrated by the linear fitting of the uv vis absorption intensities of h2o2 in the dpd pod solution with different concentrations figure s5 as a result h2o2 was not detected in an ultrasonic only system however in the coupled system h2o2 can be effectively produced the concentration profile of h2o2 was found to be linearly correlated r2 0 9998 with the time of reaction indicating that the reaction to produce h2o2 proceeded at a constant rate 96 μm h 1 the results are consistent with the degradation experiments showing that only the coupled system was able to split water to generate hydroxyl radicals the hydroxyl radicals were further converted to h2o2 in the absence of organic pollutants the relationship between dep degradation and h2o2 production under different conditions are shown in fig 3 d when the concentration of dep was increased to 20 μm or 10 mm tba was added the removal efficiencies of dep decreased from 95 to 88 and 50 respectively however the concentration of h2o2 increased from 145 μm to 184 μm and 299 μm accordingly 14 oh dep products k 4 3 98 0 21 10 9 m 1 s 1 15 oh tba products k 5 6 0 10 8 m 1 s 1 16 oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o h o 2 k 6 2 7 10 7 m 1 s 1 the oxidation rates of the organic eq 14 haag and yao 1992 and tba eq 15 neta et al 1988 by hydroxyl radicals are faster than their reactions with hydrogen peroxide eq 16 buxton et al 1988 provided only water exists in the system the excess hydroxyl radicals will react with h2o2 therefore the production rate of h2o2 will be reduced when adding dep or tba to the pure water system eq 16 will be inhibited by eq 14 or eq 15 resulting in a decrease in h2o2 consumption by hydroxyl radicals and an increase of h2o2 accumulation in the quenching experiment containing 10 mm tba the concentration of tba is 2000 fold of dep thus excessive tba greatly consumes oh in the coupled system resulting in strong inhibition of dep oxidation dropping from 95 to 49 and h2o2 consumption by oh without affecting the self reaction of oh to produce h2o2 therefore the formation rate of h2o2 was significantly increased from 96 to 198 μm h 1 scheme 1 3 3 effect of gas atmosphere on dep degradation the generated high temperature and high pressure during ultrasonic cavitation stem from the collapse of cavitation bubbles thus the physical and thermodynamic properties of the dissolved gasses such as the polytropic index thermal conductivity and solubility may influence the bubble temperature and cavitation efficiency henglein 1987 neppiras 1980 due to the high polytropic index cp cv 1 67 and chemical inertness noble gasses are often used as the dissolved gasses in sonochemical reactions because a high cp cv value will generate a high temperature neppiras 1980 and attain a high reaction yield a previous study proposed that the bubble temperature and the chemical reactions induced by cavitation were greatly affected by the thermal conductivity of the dissolved gas mcnamara et al 1999 the greater the conductivity of the gas the more heat would be dissipated to the surrounding environment to decrease the bubble temperature however okitsu et al okitsu et al 2006 analyzed the kinetics of t butane pyrolysis by sonication and found that the noble gasses he ne ar kr and xe produced a constant bubble temperature but led to different radical production rates the contradictory results may stem from the differences of the gasses in solubility which can determine the total number of effective bubbles in this work we further studied the effects of different saturated dissolved gasses including n2 he and ar with a bubbling rate of 120 ml min 1 on dep degradation the major constituents of dry air and their physical properties are listed in table s4 comparing to the control experiment without gas bubbling helium exhibited the greatest inhibitory effect on dep degradation figure s6 the removal efficiency dropped from 95 to 63 and the pseudo first order kinetic rate constant decreased to 0 013 0 001 min 1 figure s7 which is 2 8 times lower than the control experiment nitrogen atmosphere caused less inhibition with a dep removal efficiency of 79 k 0 019 0 001 min 1 in contrast the effect of ar bubbling is almost negligible table s4 shows that the thermal conductivity of air is much stronger than that of ar however under these two conditions air and ar both the removal efficiencies of dep and the first order kinetic rate constants are very close we suppose that the thermal conductivity theory is not applicable to explain the impacts of the gasses in this work fig 4 a shows the plot of the first order kinetic rate constants as a function of the solubility of he n2 and ar an excellent linear correlation r2 0 9999 was obtained between the gas solubility and the first order kinetic constants k the result is consistent with okitsu s claim that the number of cavitation bubbles is closely related to the solubility of the inert gasses which determines the radical production rate in the solution okitsu et al 2006 3 4 effect of temperature and ph on dep degradation temperature was believed to have a very important influence on the intensity and kinetics of ultrasonic cavitation wang et al 2019 figure s8 depicts that the efficiency of dep degradation decreased as the temperature increased to 35 c the solution temperature will impact vapor pressure consequently the efficiency of cavitation collapse castellanos et al 1998 suslick et al 1984 although a high temperature may facilitate bubble formation by increasing the equilibrium vapor pressure bubbles with more vapors would buffer the implosion process thus the maximum temperature upon bubble collapse will decrease which reduce the cavitation effects and lower the rates of chemical reactions meanwhile the high solution temperature will cause the degassing of the liquid phase thereby reducing the number of gaseous nuclei available for the formation of cavitation bubbles ghodbane and hamdaoui 2009 velegraki et al 2006 this result is justifiable in terms of the cavitation hot spot mechanism in sonochemistry as shown in fig 4 b a good linear correlation between the first order kinetic rate constants and the vapor pressure of water was observed within the temperature range of 15 to 35 c but the point of 45 c deviates from the linearity the result indicates that the degassing effect and excessive water vapor in the bubbles caused by the high temperature seriously affect the cavitation effect in other words this correlation is only effective in a limited range of reaction temperature this result may be related to the effect of temperature on the surface tension of water when temperature increases the surface tension of water decreases according to eqs 2 and 3 the reduction of surface tension will lower the energy barrier for nucleation conducive to generate more cavitation bubbles so when the temperature exceeds 35 c although the point of 45 c deviates from the linearity the removal efficiency of dep does not decrease significantly however it is more inclined to carry out the ultrasonic degradation process at lower temperatures generally ph of the reaction solution is an important factor in affecting the efficiency of the oxidation processes the influence of initial ph on the sonication of dep was studied in the range of 1 9 10 5 figure s9 overall the rate constant was not substantially affected by ph figure s10 we observed a slight decrease of efficiency at ph of 10 5 due to the non dissociative nature of dep the declined degradation efficiency of dep at ph 10 5 is likely due to the quenching of oh hydroxyl radical is reported to exhibit a lower oxidation potential under alkaline conditions villaroel et al 2014 zhao et al 2004 hydroxyl radical can also be scavenged by hydroxide ions via eq 17 buxton et al 1988 giving rise to the decreased degradation rates xu et al 2013 17 oh o h h 2 o o k 7 1 3 10 10 m 1 s 1 at ph of 1 9 the degradation efficiency of dep was slightly increased zhao et al zhao et al 2004 indicated that hydrogen peroxide is stable at low ph and that hydrogen peroxide could capture a proton to form an oxonium ion h3o2 the oxonium ion makes h2o2 electrophilic to enhance its stability improving the stability of h2o2 may be not favorable according to eq 7 oh oh h 2 o 2 and eq 16 oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o h o 2 instead it is beneficial to increasing the steady state concentration of oh leading to improved degradation efficiency of dep in the acidic solution ph 1 9 3 5 reaction site of dep degradation over the past few decades three possible sites have been proposed to coordinate the chemical reactions of a cavitation bubble yasui 2010 1 the interior of a bubble according to the hot spot theory the inside of the bubble is a high temperature and high pressure gas phase where the pyrolysis reaction takes place 2 the interface region at the bubble surface previous studies reported that hydroxyl radicals are most abundant at the gas liquid interface ozen et al 2005 wang et al 2007 where oh reacts with the organics solutes or itself 3 the liquid region bulk solution outside the interface region hydrogen peroxide has a relatively long lifetime to diffuse away from the interface to react with solutes at the ambient temperature considering of the low volatility and hydrophilic nature of dep and tba quenching chemicals dep was degraded by oh at the cavitation bubble interface rather than by pyrolysis inside the bubble or by h2o2 in the aqueous phase the degradation is supposed to be a heterogeneous like reaction experienced on the interface region at the bubble surface to confirm our hypothesis a heterogeneous kinetic model based on the langmuir hinshelwood l h model was applied as eq 18 the l h kinetic model was used to accommodate reactions in the solid liquid interface where the reaction rate depends on the diffusion of the reactants onto the solid pores and the chemical reaction at the solid liquid interface fox and dulay 1993 18 1 k o b s 1 k c k l h 1 k c d e p 0 where dep0 is initial dep concentration μm kobs is the first order rate constant min 1 klh is l h adsorption equilibrium constant l μmol 1 kc is the surface reaction rate constant μmol l 1 min 1 figure s11 shows the degradation kinetics of dep at different initial dep concentrations increasing the initial concentration of dep from 5 to 40 μm led to a decrease in kobs the values of klh and kc constants are displayed in table s5 fig 4 c illustrates that dep degradation perfectly follows the l h model with a high r2 value of 0 9966 the mechanism of dep degradation by ultrasonics combined with mechanical agitation is proposed in scheme 2 the proposed pathways of dep degradation in the coupled system are briefly summarized as follows 1 the formation growth and collapse of cavitation bubbles after introducing mechanical agitation into the ultrasonic system a large number of cavitation bubbles are generated in the solution then the cavitation bubbles collapse and hot spots are generated the water molecules in the bubble are dissociated into oh and h most of oh and h recombine in the cavity and the rest of oh diffuse to the gas liquid interface region where they will combine into h2o2 or react with organics 2 the diffusion of dep because of the low volatility and hydrophilic nature of dep dep diffuses from the liquid region to the gas liquid interface instead of entering the interior region of the cavitation bubbles or reacting with h2o2 in the bulk solution if the micropollutants are non polar and volatile hydrophobic organic matters their solute vapors are easier to enter the cavity where direct high temperature pyrolysis occurs wang et al 2019 3 the oxidation of dep by oh occurs at the gas liquid interface dep reacts with oh and is decomposed into a series of small molecular organics and eventually into co2 and h2o 4 conclusion in summary we performed a comprehensive study to investigate the synergy of mechanical agitation in ultrasonic degradation processes the impacts of several key factors parameters were unveiled on the oxidation efficiency introducing mechanical agitation into the ultrasonic system boosted the production of cavitation bubbles for water pyrolysis hydroxyl radicals were produced and identified as the primary reactive oxygen species dep removal efficiency was improved by increasing the agitation speed and 5 μm dep could be effectively degraded within 90 min with a removal efficiency of 95 under an agitation speed of 600 rpm the solubility of dissolved inert gasses determines the number of cavitation bubbles in the solution the increase of temperature decreased the degradation kinetics while the effect of solution ph was insignificant since the research of ultrasonic cavitation technology is still at the infant stage in a lab scale more efforts are still required to develop it into a mature water treatment technology the current technique is no doubt appealing because no external oxidants o2 h2o2 ozone and persulfates or catalysts are required for efficient production of oh and h2o2 the economic efficiency of the integrated system needs be further evaluated and compared with the commercial fenton technologies in practical applications attention should be paid to controlling the temperature of the system in the long term ultrasonic degradation process the temperature of the ultrasonic equipment and the water solution will gradually increase and the rapid rise in temperature will inhibit the cavitation effect and may also have an adverse effect on the equipment therefore in large scale processing equipment manufacturing and circulating cooling water issues need to be further considered on the other hand the ways of vortex formed in large scale applications and lab scale experimental systems must be quite different in large scale applications the ways of the vortex formed and the number of vortices in the reactor can be designed which also brings more operability for large scale applications overall the outcomes of this study will provide a facile strategy for wastewater treatment with a promising future for practical application declaration of competing interest

16987,low efficiency in energy conversion has long been the bottleneck in sonochemistry based water treatment technologies in this work we reported a simple and efficient strategy by introducing mechanical agitation into a low powered ultrasonic system to facilitate the production of cavitation bubbles the coupled system remarkably intensifies the evolution of reactive oxygen species ros for degradation of refractory organic pollutants we in situ monitored the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh by selective scavenging tests and chemical trapping experiments the operational factors such as rotation speed gas atmosphere solution temperature and ph were carefully evaluated for their impacts on the degradation of a plastic microcontaminant diethyl phthalate dep it was found that the degradation efficiency is closely related to the population of cavitation bubbles in the solution which was collaboratively governed by the aforementioned factors a high mechanical agitation speed 600 rpm great solubility of inert gas atmosphere argon and low reaction temperature 15 ºc are beneficial to the generation of cavitation bubbles and the associated production of ros this work shows a facile strategy to intensify the mechanical energy to chemical conversion and provides new mechanistic insights into the ultrasound based advanced oxidation without external chemical inputs graphical

loomis richards and loomis 1927 first used ultrasound to create cavitation phenomenon for solution degassing and acceleration of chemical reactions in recent decades sonication has been used for direct mineralization of aqueous organic pollutants owing to the advantages of operational simplicity safety and environmental friendliness balachandran et al 2016 hua and hoffmann 1996 serna galvis et al 2015 it is well accepted that sonochemistry originates from the acoustic cavitation in ultrasonically irradiated liquids briggs 1990 suslick 1986 in a sparse half cycle negative pressures are established inside the liquid when the ultrasonic intensity is high enough the average distances between molecules will change and exceed the critical value of the liquid molecular distance and then the gravity between the liquid molecules is demolished and cavitation bubbles are formed the acoustic cavitation processes include the nucleation growth and rapid collapse of microbubbles leading to the emission of sonoluminescence sl and the creation of a hot spot suslick et al 1986 in the hot spot theory when the cavitation bubble collapses the hot spot with ultrahigh temperature up to 5000 k inside the bubble and 1900 k at the interface and pressure up to 1000 atm is instantaneously generated in extremely short time as a result the surrounding water molecules are directly dissociated into highly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals oh 2 7 v which can be utilized to in situ degrade the organic pollutants in the solution due to the physical properties of hot spot and the generation of oh sonication has certain advantages over other advanced oxidation processes aops boczkaj and fernandes 2017 chen and huang 2015 liu et al 2013 wols and hofman caris 2012 in a homogeneous sonication reaction the nucleation process starts from the microscaled gas voids generated from the thermal fluctuations in the bulk solution however the degradation efficiency of the homogeneous sonication is typically very slow because of the inefficient conversion of sono energy in producing ultrasonic cavitation and difficulties in upscaling the achievement of a high degradation rate by ultrasound alone normally requires a significantly high input of electrical energy owing to the massive energy loss during thermal dissipation mahamuni and adewuyi 2010 to this end researchers are circumventing these difficulties using hybrid techniques for wastewater treatment assisted with ultrasound chen and smirniotis 2002 entezari and petrier 2005 fedorov et al 2020 gogate 2008 lesko et al 2006 namkung et al 2008 the use of heterogeneous sonocatalysts is one of the most promising strategies the presence of a heterogeneous sonocatalyst can reduce the energy barrier during the formation of cavitation bubbles doktycz and suslick 1990 shchukin et al 2011 however the heterogeneous nucleation is still challenging in the complexity of material fabrication which requires a porous architecture with optimal pore sizes qiu et al 2018 ultrasonic irradiation will cause continuous micro pitting on the solid surface of the catalyst which severely affects the lifetime and subsequent recovery of the material for multiple uses all these factors limit the application of ultrasonication in environmental remediation apart from the way of generating cavitation bubbles hydrodynamic cavitation hc and hc based aops have also been developed rapidly in recent years cako et al 2020 gagol et al 2020 2018 in hc gas bubbles are generated by special design of reactors or flow systems forcing a liquid to flow under reduced pressure this involves the creation of a local drop in static pressure of a liquid below the critical value by a local increase in flow rate or change in external conditions such as flow line curvature detachment of liquid stream from the side of the container or channel constrictions vortex based hc reactors are an important part of hc reactors sun et al 2021 wang and zhang 2009 this type of reactors does not require much operating and maintenance cost zhang et al 2019 reported the degradation of rhodamine b by vortex scattering ultrasound in aqueous solution however the key issues are not addressed including the identification of reactive oxygen species ros the existence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the factors influencing the population of cavitation bubbles as well as the underlining mechanisms in this work mechanical agitation was innovatively applied to intensify the efficiency of ultrasonic irradiation for the degradation of aqueous organic pollutants without the presences of oxidants or catalysts showing excellent efficiencies in removal of different structured organics this strategy is simple and easy to implement which not only greatly improved the efficiency of homogeneous ultrasound system but also overcame many issues of heterogeneous sonocatalysts such as poor mechanical stability and low separation efficiency we monitored the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 by tert butanol tba quenching and p phthalic acid ta capturing experiments respectively moreover we comprehensively investigated the effects of mechanical agitation speed gas atmosphere solution temperature and initial solution ph on the oxidation efficiency of the integrated system an emerging plastic mediated micropollutant diethyl phthalate dep was used as the model contaminant a low power and low frequency ultrasonic cleaner was used to reduce energy consumption which is different from the previous studies conducted under the probe of cell crusher with a high energy power and operated discontinuously in short time therefore this study proposed a facile and efficient ultrasonication system coupled with mechanical agitation

which was monitored by the absorption of the solution at 551 nm and determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of dep dmp ibp ba bpa rhb nb smx and cv were

identification of the active radicals of the ultrasonic degradation process 10 20 and 40 mm tba was added to the reaction solution as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals oh furthermore 20 μm terephthalic acid ta was used as a probe molecule to detect oh ta has been extensively used for the detection of hydroxyl radicals generated in water producing 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid taoh 3 results and discussion 3 1 mechanical agitation accelerated ultrasonic degradation process ultrasonic irradiation with a fixed low frequency 40 khz and low power 100 w was used to trigger the ultrasonic degradation of pollutants in this investigation fig 1 a shows that sole ultrasonication or mechanical agitation cannot remove dep however in the coupled system ultrasonication with mechanical agitation dep can be effectively degraded within 90 min with a high removal efficiency of 95 additionally the combined system is capable of degrading a diversity of organic pollutants such as organic dyes rhodamine b rhb and crystal violet cv pharmaceutical and personal care products ibuprofen ibp sulfamethoxazole smx and benzoic acid ba and endocrine disrupting chemicals bisphenol a bpa dimethyl phthalate dmp and nitrobenzene nb in figure s2 as displayed in the inset figure in fig 1 a dep degradation followed the pseudo first order kinetics the rate constant k of the combined system is 0 036 0 002 min 1 which is 156 times greater than the single ultrasound system k 0 023 0 017 10 2 min 1 we also compared the degradation efficiencies and rate constant values with some aops for the degradation of dep table s2 further confirming the advantages of the combined system theoretically when ultrasonic waves are applied to the aqueous solution the induced cavitation will simultaneously generate hot spots to produce oh via water pyrolysis or direct high temperature pyrolysis of the volatile organic pollutants in the interior of the hot bubbles however as we mentioned above the energy barrier of cavitation bubbles generated by sole ultrasound is relatively high especially using a low power ultrasonic source therefore the organic cannot be decomposed under sole ultrasonic irradiation in this system the standard theory balibar and caupin 2003 assumes that in the liquid solution under a negative pressure p the cavitation results from the nucleation of a spherical bubble with a radius r and a thin wall the energy of the bubble equals to the macroscopic surface tension σ the free energy f r of this bubble is 1 f r 4 π r 2 σ 4 3 π r 3 p where the first term 4πr2σ is a surface cost and the second item 4πr3p 3 is a gain in volume energy f r reaches a maximum value e for a critical radius r c 2σ p and the e is defined as the energy barrier against nucleation given by 2 e 16 π σ 3 3 p 2 according to the experimental results the energy generated by the ultrasound wave in a single ultrasonic system cannot reach the threshold for generating cavitation bubbles thus the mechanical agitation remarkably lowers the threshold to initiate the bubble nucleation in the combined system as discussed below the performances of ultrasonic degradation of dep were further shown in fig 1 b with different agitation speeds from 100 to 700 rpm at an increasing step of 100 rpm the removal of dep was greatly promoted at an increased agitation speed from 100 to 500 rpm indicating a great increase of cavitation bubbles in the system when the agitation speed reached 600 rpm the increase of the removal efficiency and rate constant for the degradation of dep was less significant we calculated the reynolds number of the system during agitation table s3 when the agitation speed is 100 rpm the reynolds number of the system is 2666 which is in the transitional period of a laminar flow and turbulent flow and no vortex can be formed when the agitation speed is 200 rpm the reynolds number of the system has reached 5333 which is a turbulent flow to form stable vortex theoretically for a stirred vessel the system is fully turbulent for values of re above 10 000 jarman 1959 this may be why the removal efficiency of dep by the system does not increase obviously when the agitation speed exceeds 500 rpm re 10 000 as shown in fig 2 the first contribution of mechanical agitation is the generation of vortex cavitation normally occurs in flowing liquids because the hydrodynamics will result in regions where the pressure falls below the vapor pressure brennen 2014 reynolds 1873 was the pioneer to investigate the unusual behavior of ship propellers at high rotation speeds when the impeller rotates the liquid around the impeller flows at a high speed then vortex will appear locally and the air pressure in the vortex region is simultaneously decreased when the pressure of the vortex area drops to the saturated vapor pressure at the local temperature water begins to vaporize meanwhile the dissolved gas and vapor in water will escape and then cavitation bubbles can be formed in the vortex region we believe that the mechanical agitation will play the similar role to the propeller in creating regional vortex in the system to facilitate the formation of cavitation bubbles in addition mechanical agitation contributes to the heterogeneous nucleation by the impeller the heterogeneous nucleation originates from the presence of sub microscopic air pockets at the solid liquid interface on the solid surface heterogeneous nucleation at a wettable surface occurs if the surface tension of the solid vapor interface σs is smaller than the surface tension of the vapor liquid interface σ at this condition the critical energy will be represented by eq 3 3 e 16 π σ 3 3 p 2 g where 4 g 1 4 2 cos θ 1 cos θ 2 the parameter g is a shape factor of the gas bubble on the surface moreover the teflon coated impeller used in this study can also intensify the heterogeneous nucleation process figure s3 this process is similar to the nucleation of cavitation bubbles on a solid surface in a heterogeneous ultrasonic system the mechanical agitation may also impact the spatial distribution of the field of ultrasound zhang et al 2019 studied the distribution of sound pressure in a transient mode using comsol s pressure acoustic module and found that the sound pressure is higher with the presence of mechanical stirring than the control group with ultrasound only for the formation of a bubble under ultrasound a pressure p has to perform work on the gas with a volume vb the pressure p the difference from the outside hydrostatic pressure of the liquid can be calculated by the following equation shchukin et al 2011 5 p p a p g p v where p g is the partial pressure of possible entrapped gas p v is the partial pressure of vaporized liquid and p a is the largest contribution being the acoustic pressure upon rarefaction obviously an increase of p a will increase p eq 5 and reduce the critical energy of e eqs 2 and 3 herein lowering the energy threshold for generating cavitation bubbles the increase of sound field pressure not only facilitates the cavitation in the vortex region and the impeller region but also reduces the energy threshold of the sole acoustic cavitation to the point where cavitation bubbles can be generated in conclusion due to the strong synergy caused by mechanical agitation a greater population of cavitation bubbles are generated these cavitation bubbles undergo growth and collapse under ultrasound irradiation generating a myriad of hot spots for water dissociation and ultimately producing more ros for pollutant oxidation 3 2 identification of hydroxyl radicals and production of hydrogen peroxide ultrasound will cause the decomposition of water vapor in the generated cavitation bubbles with high temperature and pressure and the reaction can be described as eq 6 makino et al 1983 6 h 2 o sonolysis h oh after the initial cleavage of h2o 80 of oh and h are reported to recombine into water in the cavity fischer et al 1986 the net quantity of oh produced in the gas filled cavity may diffuse to the gas liquid interfacial region to form hydrogen peroxide via eq 7 buxton et al 1988 7 oh oh h 2 o 2 2 k 1 1 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 if oxygen is presented in the vapor phase of the bubble it may react with h to produce ho2 via eq 8 buxton et al 1988 the self reaction of two ho2 at the ambient temperature also produces h2o2 via eq 9 buxton et al 1988 8 o 2 h h o 2 k 2 2 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 9 h o 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 k 3 8 3 10 5 m 1 s 1 in addition to reacting with h to produce ho2 oxygen can also directly participate in supercritical water oxidation reactions wang et al 2019 in sonication process water is in the supercritical state in the transition zone between bubbles and solution and the supercritical water has the same diffusion coefficient as gas 10 100 times higher than the ambient liquid and a lower viscosity meanwhile the water in the supercritical state has the same density as liquid but greater solubility than the adventitious substances aqueous non volatile organic compounds are soluble in supercritical water and can react with the dissolved oxidants such as air and oxygen wang et al 2019 possible reaction processes are shown in eqs 10 13 10 rh o 2 r h o 2 11 rh h o 2 r h 2 o 2 12 r o 2 roo 13 roo rh rooh r in this section we experimentally investigated the formation of oh and assessed the contribution of air or oxygen to dep degradation tba is a specific radical scavenger for oh because of the rapid rate constant 6 0 108 m 1s 1 as shown in fig 3 a the increased concentration of tba resulted in deteriorated dep degradation in the coupled system the pseudo first order kinetic rate constant of dep degradation in the presence of 10 mm tba was 0 006 0 002 min 1 which was 6 times lower than the corresponding value in the control experiment 0 036 0 002 min 1 a higher dose of tba 40 mm almost inhibited dep degradation the removal efficiency decreased to 6 7 with a pseudo first order kinetic rate constant of 0 007 0 001 10 1 min 1 which was 51 4 times lower than that of the control experiment the tba quenching tests indicated that oh is the dominant ros in the coupled system in evaluation of the contribution of dissolved oxygen do high purity argon was continuously bubbled into the system to remove do as shown in fig 3 a dep degradation was not affected by argon purging and the removal efficiency was similar to the original rate therefore the dissolved oxygen did not participate in the evolution of ros or contribute to the degradation of dep a chemical probe p phthalic acid ta 50 μm was used to detect hydroxyl radicals because the hydroxyl radicals can react with ta to generate a characteristic product of 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid taoh which can be detected by hplc yang et al 2020 fig 3 b shows that taoh was gradually generated while ta was degraded nearly 80 of the removed ta 18 μm were converted and 12 μm taoh was generated in 90 min figure s4 which directly proved the existence of hydroxyl radicals in the coupled system the relative low content of taoh could be attributed to its further decomposition by the excessive ros fig 3 c shows the formation of h2o2 in different systems the concentration of h2o2 was calibrated by the linear fitting of the uv vis absorption intensities of h2o2 in the dpd pod solution with different concentrations figure s5 as a result h2o2 was not detected in an ultrasonic only system however in the coupled system h2o2 can be effectively produced the concentration profile of h2o2 was found to be linearly correlated r2 0 9998 with the time of reaction indicating that the reaction to produce h2o2 proceeded at a constant rate 96 μm h 1 the results are consistent with the degradation experiments showing that only the coupled system was able to split water to generate hydroxyl radicals the hydroxyl radicals were further converted to h2o2 in the absence of organic pollutants the relationship between dep degradation and h2o2 production under different conditions are shown in fig 3 d when the concentration of dep was increased to 20 μm or 10 mm tba was added the removal efficiencies of dep decreased from 95 to 88 and 50 respectively however the concentration of h2o2 increased from 145 μm to 184 μm and 299 μm accordingly 14 oh dep products k 4 3 98 0 21 10 9 m 1 s 1 15 oh tba products k 5 6 0 10 8 m 1 s 1 16 oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o h o 2 k 6 2 7 10 7 m 1 s 1 the oxidation rates of the organic eq 14 haag and yao 1992 and tba eq 15 neta et al 1988 by hydroxyl radicals are faster than their reactions with hydrogen peroxide eq 16 buxton et al 1988 provided only water exists in the system the excess hydroxyl radicals will react with h2o2 therefore the production rate of h2o2 will be reduced when adding dep or tba to the pure water system eq 16 will be inhibited by eq 14 or eq 15 resulting in a decrease in h2o2 consumption by hydroxyl radicals and an increase of h2o2 accumulation in the quenching experiment containing 10 mm tba the concentration of tba is 2000 fold of dep thus excessive tba greatly consumes oh in the coupled system resulting in strong inhibition of dep oxidation dropping from 95 to 49 and h2o2 consumption by oh without affecting the self reaction of oh to produce h2o2 therefore the formation rate of h2o2 was significantly increased from 96 to 198 μm h 1 scheme 1 3 3 effect of gas atmosphere on dep degradation the generated high temperature and high pressure during ultrasonic cavitation stem from the collapse of cavitation bubbles thus the physical and thermodynamic properties of the dissolved gasses such as the polytropic index thermal conductivity and solubility may influence the bubble temperature and cavitation efficiency henglein 1987 neppiras 1980 due to the high polytropic index cp cv 1 67 and chemical inertness noble gasses are often used as the dissolved gasses in sonochemical reactions because a high cp cv value will generate a high temperature neppiras 1980 and attain a high reaction yield a previous study proposed that the bubble temperature and the chemical reactions induced by cavitation were greatly affected by the thermal conductivity of the dissolved gas mcnamara et al 1999 the greater the conductivity of the gas the more heat would be dissipated to the surrounding environment to decrease the bubble temperature however okitsu et al okitsu et al 2006 analyzed the kinetics of t butane pyrolysis by sonication and found that the noble gasses he ne ar kr and xe produced a constant bubble temperature but led to different radical production rates the contradictory results may stem from the differences of the gasses in solubility which can determine the total number of effective bubbles in this work we further studied the effects of different saturated dissolved gasses including n2 he and ar with a bubbling rate of 120 ml min 1 on dep degradation the major constituents of dry air and their physical properties are listed in table s4 comparing to the control experiment without gas bubbling helium exhibited the greatest inhibitory effect on dep degradation figure s6 the removal efficiency dropped from 95 to 63 and the pseudo first order kinetic rate constant decreased to 0 013 0 001 min 1 figure s7 which is 2 8 times lower than the control experiment nitrogen atmosphere caused less inhibition with a dep removal efficiency of 79 k 0 019 0 001 min 1 in contrast the effect of ar bubbling is almost negligible table s4 shows that the thermal conductivity of air is much stronger than that of ar however under these two conditions air and ar both the removal efficiencies of dep and the first order kinetic rate constants are very close we suppose that the thermal conductivity theory is not applicable to explain the impacts of the gasses in this work fig 4 a shows the plot of the first order kinetic rate constants as a function of the solubility of he n2 and ar an excellent linear correlation r2 0 9999 was obtained between the gas solubility and the first order kinetic constants k the result is consistent with okitsu s claim that the number of cavitation bubbles is closely related to the solubility of the inert gasses which determines the radical production rate in the solution okitsu et al 2006 3 4 effect of temperature and ph on dep degradation temperature was believed to have a very important influence on the intensity and kinetics of ultrasonic cavitation wang et al 2019 figure s8 depicts that the efficiency of dep degradation decreased as the temperature increased to 35 c the solution temperature will impact vapor pressure consequently the efficiency of cavitation collapse castellanos et al 1998 suslick et al 1984 although a high temperature may facilitate bubble formation by increasing the equilibrium vapor pressure bubbles with more vapors would buffer the implosion process thus the maximum temperature upon bubble collapse will decrease which reduce the cavitation effects and lower the rates of chemical reactions meanwhile the high solution temperature will cause the degassing of the liquid phase thereby reducing the number of gaseous nuclei available for the formation of cavitation bubbles ghodbane and hamdaoui 2009 velegraki et al 2006 this result is justifiable in terms of the cavitation hot spot mechanism in sonochemistry as shown in fig 4 b a good linear correlation between the first order kinetic rate constants and the vapor pressure of water was observed within the temperature range of 15 to 35 c but the point of 45 c deviates from the linearity the result indicates that the degassing effect and excessive water vapor in the bubbles caused by the high temperature seriously affect the cavitation effect in other words this correlation is only effective in a limited range of reaction temperature this result may be related to the effect of temperature on the surface tension of water when temperature increases the surface tension of water decreases according to eqs 2 and 3 the reduction of surface tension will lower the energy barrier for nucleation conducive to generate more cavitation bubbles so when the temperature exceeds 35 c although the point of 45 c deviates from the linearity the removal efficiency of dep does not decrease significantly however it is more inclined to carry out the ultrasonic degradation process at lower temperatures generally ph of the reaction solution is an important factor in affecting the efficiency of the oxidation processes the influence of initial ph on the sonication of dep was studied in the range of 1 9 10 5 figure s9 overall the rate constant was not substantially affected by ph figure s10 we observed a slight decrease of efficiency at ph of 10 5 due to the non dissociative nature of dep the declined degradation efficiency of dep at ph 10 5 is likely due to the quenching of oh hydroxyl radical is reported to exhibit a lower oxidation potential under alkaline conditions villaroel et al 2014 zhao et al 2004 hydroxyl radical can also be scavenged by hydroxide ions via eq 17 buxton et al 1988 giving rise to the decreased degradation rates xu et al 2013 17 oh o h h 2 o o k 7 1 3 10 10 m 1 s 1 at ph of 1 9 the degradation efficiency of dep was slightly increased zhao et al zhao et al 2004 indicated that hydrogen peroxide is stable at low ph and that hydrogen peroxide could capture a proton to form an oxonium ion h3o2 the oxonium ion makes h2o2 electrophilic to enhance its stability improving the stability of h2o2 may be not favorable according to eq 7 oh oh h 2 o 2 and eq 16 oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o h o 2 instead it is beneficial to increasing the steady state concentration of oh leading to improved degradation efficiency of dep in the acidic solution ph 1 9 3 5 reaction site of dep degradation over the past few decades three possible sites have been proposed to coordinate the chemical reactions of a cavitation bubble yasui 2010 1 the interior of a bubble according to the hot spot theory the inside of the bubble is a high temperature and high pressure gas phase where the pyrolysis reaction takes place 2 the interface region at the bubble surface previous studies reported that hydroxyl radicals are most abundant at the gas liquid interface ozen et al 2005 wang et al 2007 where oh reacts with the organics solutes or itself 3 the liquid region bulk solution outside the interface region hydrogen peroxide has a relatively long lifetime to diffuse away from the interface to react with solutes at the ambient temperature considering of the low volatility and hydrophilic nature of dep and tba quenching chemicals dep was degraded by oh at the cavitation bubble interface rather than by pyrolysis inside the bubble or by h2o2 in the aqueous phase the degradation is supposed to be a heterogeneous like reaction experienced on the interface region at the bubble surface to confirm our hypothesis a heterogeneous kinetic model based on the langmuir hinshelwood l h model was applied as eq 18 the l h kinetic model was used to accommodate reactions in the solid liquid interface where the reaction rate depends on the diffusion of the reactants onto the solid pores and the chemical reaction at the solid liquid interface fox and dulay 1993 18 1 k o b s 1 k c k l h 1 k c d e p 0 where dep0 is initial dep concentration μm kobs is the first order rate constant min 1 klh is l h adsorption equilibrium constant l μmol 1 kc is the surface reaction rate constant μmol l 1 min 1 figure s11 shows the degradation kinetics of dep at different initial dep concentrations increasing the initial concentration of dep from 5 to 40 μm led to a decrease in kobs the values of klh and kc constants are displayed in table s5 fig 4 c illustrates that dep degradation perfectly follows the l h model with a high r2 value of 0 9966 the mechanism of dep degradation by ultrasonics combined with mechanical agitation is proposed in scheme 2 the proposed pathways of dep degradation in the coupled system are briefly summarized as follows 1 the formation growth and collapse of cavitation bubbles after introducing mechanical agitation into the ultrasonic system a large number of cavitation bubbles are generated in the solution then the cavitation bubbles collapse and hot spots are generated the water molecules in the bubble are dissociated into oh and h most of oh and h recombine in the cavity and the rest of oh diffuse to the gas liquid interface region where they will combine into h2o2 or react with organics 2 the diffusion of dep because of the low volatility and hydrophilic nature of dep dep diffuses from the liquid region to the gas liquid interface instead of entering the interior region of the cavitation bubbles or reacting with h2o2 in the bulk solution if the micropollutants are non polar and volatile hydrophobic organic matters their solute vapors are easier to enter the cavity where direct high temperature pyrolysis occurs wang et al 2019 3 the oxidation of dep by oh occurs at the gas liquid interface dep reacts with oh and is decomposed into a series of small molecular organics and eventually into co2 and h2o 4 conclusion in summary we performed a comprehensive study to investigate the synergy of mechanical agitation in ultrasonic degradation processes the impacts of several key factors parameters were unveiled on the oxidation efficiency introducing mechanical agitation into the ultrasonic system boosted the production of cavitation bubbles for water pyrolysis hydroxyl radicals were produced and identified as the primary reactive oxygen species dep removal efficiency was improved by increasing the agitation speed and 5 μm dep could be effectively degraded within 90 min with a removal efficiency of 95 under an agitation speed of 600 rpm the solubility of dissolved inert gasses determines the number of cavitation bubbles in the solution the increase of temperature decreased the degradation kinetics while the effect of solution ph was insignificant since the research of ultrasonic cavitation technology is still at the infant stage in a lab scale more efforts are still required to develop it into a mature water treatment technology the current technique is no doubt appealing because no external oxidants o2 h2o2 ozone and persulfates or catalysts are required for efficient production of oh and h2o2 the economic efficiency of the integrated system needs be further evaluated and compared with the commercial fenton technologies in practical applications attention should be paid to controlling the temperature of the system in the long term ultrasonic degradation process the temperature of the ultrasonic equipment and the water solution will gradually increase and the rapid rise in temperature will inhibit the cavitation effect and may also have an adverse effect on the equipment therefore in large scale processing equipment manufacturing and circulating cooling water issues need to be further considered on the other hand the ways of vortex formed in large scale applications and lab scale experimental systems must be quite different in large scale applications the ways of the vortex formed and the number of vortices in the reactor can be designed which also brings more operability for large scale applications overall the outcomes of this study will provide a facile strategy for wastewater treatment with a promising future for practical application declaration of competing interest

16988,metal free polymeric carbon nitride c3n4 photocatalysts offer attractive technological advantages over the conventional transition metal oxides or sulfides based photocatalysts in water disinfection but their antimicrobial activities are limited by their rapid charge carrier recombination and low specific surface areas by controlling photocatalytic pathways we obtained in amino rich holey ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets ahucn a highly efficient inactivation rate against e coli which is the highest among the monolithic g c3n4 and exceeds the antibacterial performance of the most of the previously reported g c3n4 based photocatalysts both the experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the high photocatalytic disinfection performance of ahucn was derived from the synergistic advantages of their unique holey ultrathin structure and the amino rich surface in controlling the charge separation and transfer and most importantly in increasing the photo production of the dominant antibacterial species h2o2 from the analysis of the reactive oxygen species and rotating disk electrode rde measurements it was found that the presence of abundant surface amino groups enabled the switch of the oxygen reduction pathway from the two step single electron indirect reduction on holey ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets hucn to the one step two electron direct reduction on ahucn the switch of the h2o2 production pathway not only facilitated the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs but also promoted the generation of reactive oxygen species greatly enhancing photocatalytic disinfection efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords g c3n4 nanosheets holey ultrathin structure surface functionalization photocatalytic disinfection 1 introduction with significant industrialization and rapid population growth a large number of pathogenic microorganisms associated with industrial wastewater domestic sewage and livestock waste are released into the natural water posing a great threat to human life and health wang et al 2017 kaper et al 2004 daub et al 2020 recently according to the world health organization who human transmissions of microbial pathogens from drinking water and consequent illness are widespread in countries at all levels of economic development who 2019 to disinfect water of pathogenic microorganisms there have been developed various traditional disinfection technologies including chlorination ozone and ultraviolet uv liu et al 2016 wang et al 2012 however their high cost long treatment time and production of harmful disinfection by products have raised serious cost and health concerns recently limiting their future applications in water treatment practice yang et al 2013 sharma et al al 2014 therefore novel approaches are needed for the removal of pathogenic microorganisms from drinking water with high efficiency economic feasibility and environmental friendliness since the first discovery of matsunaga and co workers on photocatalytic inactivation of microbial cells over tio2 matsunaga et al 1985 photocatalytic disinfection technology has attracted great research interest due to its nontoxicity and mild reaction conditions in this process electrons and holes are generated on the surface of photocatalysts when the photocatalytic materials are excited by light they react with the o2 and oh absorbed on near the surface of the photocatalyst to produce various reactive oxygen species ross such as oh o2 and h2o2 which then act to cause the destruction of the microorganisms foster et al 2011 dalrymple et al 2010 maness et al 1999 although a considerable amount of effort has been contributed to the development of photocatalysts for bacterial inactivation in the past decades significant challenges remain pelaez et al 2012 foremost among them is the low photocatalytic efficiency of the current photocatalysts which so far are largely concentrated on transition metal oxides or sulfides photocatalysts m n chong et al 2010 to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency numerous methods have been used such as compositional doping heterojunctions nanostructure design and surface modifications all with limited success habibi yangjeh et al 2020 m n chong et al 2010 moreover most of them would increase the complexity and cost of the operation some photocatalysts specially those with proven strong antiviral activity contain heavy metals e g cu ag the ionic form of which may be released into treated water raising significant health concerns wang et al 2013 hou et al 2010 thus it would be highly desirable to design new photocatalysts with superior performance but free of toxic metals it would be equally important if the catalyst should have distinct structural characteristics to facilitate investigation of its catalytic disinfection mechanism so that mechanistic design of new superior photocatalysts will soon approach a reality owing to its fascinating properties such as tunable structures versatile surface functional groups and low cost processibility organic semiconductor based photocatalysts have attracted much attention in recent years rojas and horcajada 2020 zhang et al 2016 vyas et al 2016 noteworthy among them polymeric carbon nitride c3n4 has emerged as the most promising candidate for metal free photocatalysts in water disinfection by virtue of their appealing electronic structure abundance tunable optical and electronic properties chemical stability and environment benign characteristics zeng et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 since huang et al reported first that g c3n4 could be applied in the photocatalytic disinfection by inactivation of e coli under visible light irradiation huang et al 2014 this metal free semiconductor photocatalyst and its modified forms have gained more attention as potential antimicrobial agents unfortunately two major challenges namely low photocatalytic efficiency and limited surface active sites have greatly hindered their applications in water disinfection one possible route to improving the photocatalytic efficiency of g c3n4 is to obtain porous ultrathin structure as the porous nature can supply a lager surface area and expose more active sites while the ultrathin structure may greatly shorten the migration distance of charge carriers from bulk to surface which will greatly reduce the recombination possibility wen et al 2017 ong et al 2016 for instance zhao et al demonstrated that 2 107 cfu ml 1 of e coli could be killed completely within 4 h in the presence of single layer g c3n4 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation zhao et al 2014 xiao et al found that as prepared porous few layer c3n4 exhibited ultrahigh redox activity and selectivity than bulk counterpart xiao et al 2019 in addition amino functionalized photocatalytic materials are reported to have good catalytic activities very recently liu et al 2015 li et al 2016 it is believed that amino nitrogen components not only can remarkably promote the interfacial electron transfer but also enhance the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules because of their abundant localized electrons fu et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 it is therefore postulated that by combining amino modification with porous ultrathin structure the amino functionalized holey ultrathin g c3n4 ahucn may hold great promise to be a strong metal free photocatalyst for water disinfection accordingly we synthesized amino rich porous ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets ahucn by a sequential polycondensation thermally induced exfoliation and subsequent chemical hydrolysis process the as prepared sample showed a remarkable activity in photocatalytic disinfection on e coli under am1 5g irradiation which was superior to the previously reported monolithic and composite g c3n4 photocatalysts while the photocatalytic activity clearly benefited from the porous ultrathin structure surprisingly the photocatalytic pathway was redirected from the two step single electron indirect oxygen reduction to the one step two electron direct oxygen reduction by the abundant surface amino groups on ahucn the switch of the photocatalytic pathway greatly accelerated the generation of the primary bactericidal species h2o2 reactive oxygen species resulting in greatly enhanced photocatalytic disinfection rate 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals all chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification melamine polyethylene glycol peg mw 10000 and concentrated hydrochloric acid were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent corporation shanghai china deionized di water 18 2 mω was produced by an ultrapure water system 2 2 synthesis of photocatalysts the g c3n4 nanosheets were synthesized by a hydrogen bond assisted approach based on a previous report xing et al 2016 in a typical synthesis process 0 05 g peg mw 10 000 and melamine 5 00 g were dispersed in distilled water 30 ml under continuous stirring until the solution became transparent then the mixture was dried at 80 c in vacuum for 12 h to ensure the water had evaporated completely subsequently the white solid was transferred into a crucible with a cover and calcined at 600 c for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 cmin 1 to obtained ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets the as synthesized ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets were further thermally treated at 520 c in an open system for 4 5 h at a heating rate of 5 cmin 1 the obtained light yellow powder was denoted as the holey ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets hucn finally 100 mg hucn and 10 ml 37 concentrated hydrochloric acid were added into 50 ml flask and the mixture continuously stirred for 4 h at 37 c after the reaction the products were centrifuged washed several times until the liquid supernatant reached neutral ph and dried at 40 c for 12 h in a vacuum oven to obtain the final product of the amino rich holey ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets ahucn photocatalysts for comparison the bulk g c3n4 bcn was prepared by the thermal polycondensation of melamine at 550 c in a semi closed system for 4 h 2 3

analyzing the electronic structures of the as synthesized samples the first principles calculations were performed based on density function theory and calculated at b3lyp 6 31 level 2 4 electrochemical analysis photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted at room temperature on a three electrode system that includes a working electrode a platinum counter electrode and a ag agcl reference electrode sce by using a chi 660d electrochemical workstation the working electrodes were prepared by electroplating as synthesized photocatalysts on the fto sno2 f substrates the electrolyte used was 0 2 m na2so4 solution the rotating disk electrode analysis was performed on gamry instrument potentiostat reference 600 with a three electrode cell system in which ag agcl electrode and a pt foil electrode were used as the reference and counter electrodes respectively the working electrode was prepared as follows first 5 mg of the as prepared sample was dispersed in 1

american type culture collection manassas va usa were used for photocatalytic disinfection experiments the bacterial cells were incubated in nutrient broth at 37 c for 12 h after centrifugation they were washed twice using a buffer solution 0 05 m kh2po4 and 0 05 m k2hpo4 ph 7 0 and diluted to a cell suspension of ca 3 108 cfu ml in buffer solution prior to the use for photocatalytic disinfection experiments in the photocatalytic disinfection of e coli experiment 10 mg photocatalyst and 3 ml buffer solution were first added into 5 ml centrifuge tube and dispersed ultrasonically for 5 min then 3 ml of the photocatalyst mixture and 7 ml e coli suspension were added into the petri dish so that the final cell density and photocatalyst concentration were adjusted to about 3 107 cfu ml and 1 g l respectively the reaction mixture so formed was exposed to the visible light and am1 5 g solar light irradiation for the determination of the photocatalytic disinfection activities of the photocatalyst samples for the photocatalysis experiment the light source was a 300 w xe arc lamp plssxe300 beijing trusttech co ltd beijing china equipped with an air mass 1 5 global filter am 1 5 g or uv cutoff filter λ 400 nm the average visible irradiation intensity was measured to be about 47 mw cm2 before the photocatalytic treatment the suspension was stirred in dark for 15 min during the photocatalysis test the reaction mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer throughout the experiment at different time intervals 100 μl of aliquots of the powder treated cell suspensions were collected and turned to appropriate dilutions in buffer solution then three aliquots of 100 μl suspensions were immediately spread onto three agar medium plates and incubated at 37 c for 24 h finally the number of viable cells in terms of colony forming units was counted for comparison control experiments were also conducted in the dark with the photocatalyst and under light illumination only without photocatalyst while the other experimental conditions were the same 2 6 measurements of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 concentration the in situ photogenerated h2o2 concentration was determined by a colorimetric dpd method in which the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd is oxidized by the horseradish peroxidase pod catalyzed oxidation reaction bader et al 1988 typically 0 1 g dpd and 10 mg pod were firstly dissolved in 10 ml of 0 1 m h2so4 solution and 10 ml di water respectively for the detection of h2o2 concentration aliquots 5 ml of irradiated catalyst solution was pipetted into a 10 ml test tube and then mixed with 0 5 ml phosphate buffer solution 0 5 m kh2po4 and 0 5 m k2hpo4 subsequently 50μl dpd solution and 50μl pod solution were added into the mixture solution in sequence after shaking for 10 s and then settling for 30 s the above solution was subjected to the uv vis spectrum measurement the h2o2 concentration was quantified by the uv 2550 spectrophotometer monitoring the absorption maximum at λmax of 551 nm 3 results 3 1 synthesis of holey ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets the amino rich holey ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets ahucn were synthesized by thermal condensation and chemical etching as depicted schematically in fig 1 briefly layered precursors were first prepared from melamine and polyethylene glycol peg mw 10 000 reagents the layered structure may be due to the easy deposition of melamine along the direction of the uniform and ordered chain structure of peg via the formation of nh o hydrogen bonds the direct calcination of the layered precursors then resulted in ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets as previously reported xing et al 2016 with further thermal oxidation the ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets were thermally etched into the hucn as some cn species in the g c3n4 matrix were selectively removed or etched upon exposing to concentrated hydrochloric acid the abundant c n motifs and c n defects in the hucn framework were further chemically etched resulting in ahucn ong et al 2015 huang et al 2018 3 2 structural and compositional analysis the crystal structures of the as prepared samples were determined by x ray diffraction xrd as indicated in fig 2 a two peaks were observed in the bcn sample at 13 1 and 27 4 corresponding to 100 and 002 planes of g c3n4 jcpds 87 1526 respectively han et al 2017 the same two peaks were also seen in the hucn and ahucn samples but the peak intensities were weakened substantially implying the nanocrystalline and or amorphous nature of g c3n4 after the secondary thermal oxidation both peaks for the ahucn were nearly the same as those for the hucn as the final chemical etching was expected to have very little effect on the crystal structure in all cases the characteristic 002 peak which came from interlayer periodic stacking along the c axis in g c3n4 was quite broad indicating that only a few graphitic atomic layers were formed in the individual g c3n4 moreover the 002 peak of ahucn was shifted from 27 4 to 28 1 reflecting a stronger interaction between the adjacent layers the peak at 13 1 originated from the repeated in planar structural packing was much weaker for the hucn and ahucn suggesting that the secondary thermal oxidation step might have disturbed the intralayer long range atomic order and introduced structural defects the molecular structures of the as prepared samples were examined by the fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy as shown in fig 2b all three samples had almost the same ftir spectra indicating that the ahucn maintained a similar chemical structure as those of the bulk and hucn the absorption peak at around 810 cm 1 could be attributed to the breathing mode of tri s triazine ring the peaks in the region from 900 to 1800 cm 1 were caused by the stretching vibrations of the heptazine heterocyclic ring the broad peaks between 3000 and 3600 cm 1 were from n h stretching han et al 2018 the compositions and chemical states of ahucn were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as observed in xps survey spectra fig 3 a ahucn is mainly composed of c n and o the fairly small o 1 s peaks could be attributed to surface adsorbed oxygen containing species liang et al 2015 for closer examinations of c and n peaks high resolution xps scans over c 1 s and n 1 s of the as prepared hucn and ahucn samples were obtained as shown in fig 3b the high resolution xps scans over c 1 s of both hucn and ahucn contained three components located at 284 6 286 0 and 287 9 ev assigned to the graphitic carbon n c n coordination in the framework of g c3n4 and cnhx x 1 2 on the edges of heptazine units respectively yu et al 2017 the high resolution scans over n 1 s peak are shown in fig 3c where the typical g c3n4 xps n 1 s spectrum could be deconvoluted into four peaks with binding energies of 398 6 399 8 400 9 and 404 0 ev corresponding to the c n c groups n c 3 groups nhx groups and positive charge localization in heptazine framework respectively liang et al 2015 in fig 3c while the hucn sample had a typical g c3n4 n 1 s spectrum for the ahucn sample there was a slight shift of the n c 3 groups toward lower binding energy this shift was apparently induced by the distortion of the g c3n4 lattice after chemical etching by integrating the areas under individual peaks atomic ratios of the chemical species on the sample surfaces were calculated and the calculated results are tablulated in fig 3d fig 3d clearly shows that the surface c n atomic ratio increased drastically from 0 76 in the bcn to 0 83 in the hucn pointing to the preferred loss of nitrogen atoms during the thermal etching process however with further chemical etching the c n atomic ratio in ahucn was not increased but lowered to be close to 3 4 of the stoichiometric g c3n4 this means some extra carbon atoms were lost from the pristine ahucn during the chemical etching process to further investigate the effects of concentrated hydrochloric acid treatment on the surface elemental composition of ahucn the gaussian lorentzian functions were applied to calculate the contents of chemical bonds in as prepared samples as listed in fig 3d the mole percentage of nhx groups in ahucn was about 1 8 times higher than that of hucn suggesting the introduction of surface amidogen in addition compared to hucn the mole percentage of cnhx increases from 0 92 in hucn to 1 4 in ahucn further confirming the formation of amidogen after concentrated hydrochloric acid treatment thus based on the xps results we can infer that some of the c atoms were removed by the concentrated hydrochloric acid treatment leading to the formation of c vacancies the presence of a c vacancy then leaves the two coordinated n atoms with unbonded electrons and in an atmosphere abundant of protons the h could bond with those n atoms to produce amidogen groups based on the above analysis a possible surface structure of ahucn samples is illustrated in figure s1 supporting information 3 3 microscopic morphology to observe the microscopic morphology of as prepared samples field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and transmission electron microscopy tem images were taken and presented in figure s2 supplementary supporting information and fig 4 a b the morphology of the as prepared bcn samples was a typical thick layered stacked structure figure s2 a c for the hucn samples sheet like nanostructures were observed along with a large number of holes throughout the in plane of nanosheets figure s2 b moreover the basic sheet was slightly bent and its edges were ragged as the individual sheet attempted to minimize its surface energy xiao et al 2019 the ultrathin holey structures of hucn can be also confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy tem image as shown in figure s2 d the sem and tem images of ahucn shown in fig 4a b demonstrated that the ahucn also had a ultrathin holey structural features however the surface of ahucn becomes much rougher owing to the chemical etching which is markedly different from the smooth surface morphology of hucn inset in figure s2 b the pore structures and brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface areas of the as synthesized samples were further characterized by n2 adsorption desorption measurements at 77 4 k as shown in fig 4c ahucn exhibits a representative type iv curve with a high adsorption capacity at high relative pressures indicating the highly porous structure of ahucn moreover the bet surface area of ahucn was determined to be 94 35 m2 g 1 which is almost 3 times higher than that of bcn 22 32 m2 g 1 and slightly less than that of hucn 127 22 m2 g 1 the smaller bet of ahucn as compared to that of hucn may be attributed to the agglomeration of the nanosheets enhanced by the amino rich surface insert images in fig 4c show the pore size distributions which revealed the presence of abundant meso and macropores in ahucn in agreement with the tem analysis the thickness of as synthesized ahucn samples was further investigated by atomic force microscopy afm as shown in fig 4d thicknesses of the nanosheet was approximately 3 nm which amounts to about ten atomic layers of c n it should be noted that the highly porous structure of few layer c3n4 and its large surface area can accommodate more active sites which are beneficial for improving photocatalytic performance 3 4 optical properties and electronic structures the optical properties of the as synthesized photocatalysts were examined by measuring the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrum drs fig 5 a shows the light absorbance of the three photocatalysts from the reflectance data optical absorbance could be approximated by the kubelka munk function tauc et al 1966 accordingly their band gap values could be calculated by the construction of tauc plots f r hv n vs hv from the light absorbance data as shown in fig 5b bcn photocatalyst demonstrated the characteristic spectrum with the fundamental absorbance stopping edge at 460 nm and the corresponding band gap was determined at 2 78 ev however both of the hucn and ahucn nanoparticles exhibited a blue shift of the absorption edge compared with bcn and their corresponding band gaps were determined at 3 0 and 2 98 ev respectively the increased bandgap can be attributed to the strong quantum confinement effect caused by the nature of ultrathin holey nanosheets moreover both hucn and ahucn photocatalysts produced clear light absorption tails which could be caused by the presence of defects in the structure finally it is worth noting that the light absorbance of the ahucn exhibited a slight shift towards the long wave which could be ascribed to the abundant amino groups present on the surface of the ahucn xps valence band spectra were used to further quantify the electronic band structure of the as synthesized samples as shown in fig 5c the value of valence band maximum vb max of bcn hucn and ahucn were found to be 1 5 1 3 and 1 6 ev respectively compared to bcn the vb potential of hucn was upshifted by about 0 20 ev which could be attributed to the presence of defects in the structure combined with the results of uv vis drs the valence band spectra allowed the calculations of the band structures of the three photocatalysts as illustrated in fig 5d where the band alignments of as synthesized samples referred to the redox potentials of photocatalytic reduction and oxidation are schematically given from the calculations the conduction band cb bottom of bcn hucn and ahucn samples were found to be 1 28 1 7 and 1 38 ev vs sce respectively it should be noted that the 0 20 ev downshift of the conduction band may be caused by carbon vacancies of ahucn and the formation of amino groups on the surface of ahucn as compared to hucn this is confirmed by ab initio calculations of the conjugated melem models figure s3 based on the time dependent density functional theory td dft performed within the gaussian03 program 3 5 photocatalytic disinfection a common pathogenic microorganism e coli was chosen to evaluate the photocatalytic disinfection activity in terms of the survival ratio of e coli nt n0 where n0 and nt are the numbers of colony forming units at the initial and each following time interval respectively fig 6 a shows the e coli survival ratio under a m 1 5 g light illumination with various treatments without light illumination the bacterial concentration remained unchanged in the dark suggesting that no toxic effect of ahucn to e coli cells control experiments were also conducted with only a m 1 5 g irradiation but no photocatalyst presence after 30 min light illumination the survival ratio of e coli cells was slightly decreased which could be ascribed to the well known bactericidal effect of the ultraviolet radiation in the full spectrum of sunlight notably with light irradiation plus photocatalyst the e coli survival ratio dropped drastically to 10 7 with 3 107 cfu ml 1 of e coli killed completely in just 30 min this represents the highest bacterial killing rate so far reported for g c3n4 based photocatalysts table 1 which clearly demonstrated the high efficiency of ahucn photocatalysts in the photocatalytic disinfection with the uv removed fig 6b shows the e coli survival curves under the visible light illumination without photocatalysts or just with photocatalysts no clear bactericidal effect was observed indicating no photolysis of bacterial cells under visible light irradiation alone and no toxic effect of all the photocatalysts to e coli cells when bcn photocatalyst was used just a moderate photocatalytic disinfection effect on e coli cells was observed under the visible light illumination the survival ratio of e coli cells just fell to 10 2 after 2 h photocatalysis with hucn photocatalyst a stronger bactericidal effect was measured under visible light illumination after 2 h treatment the survival ratio of e coli cells over hucn was decreased to 2 10 4 which was 2 magnitudes lower than bcn counterparts this could be mainly attributed to the high photogenerated carrier separation efficiency caused by the ultrathin holey structure of hucn when the ahucn was irradiated by the visible light the survival ratio of e coli cells dropped sharply and continuously with the increase of the exposure time until complete inactivation of e coli was observed after 2 h treatment the average e coli inactivation rate of the ahucn sample was more than 3 logs and 5 logs faster than the hucn and bcn samples the differences clearly show that the porous ultrathin structure combined with abundant amino groups on the surface of ahucn could largely enhance the photocatalytic disinfection activity of the ahucn sample for comparisons the average rate of photocatalytic disinfection was calculated in terms of the ratio of the log reduction of the bacterial concentration over photocatalytic time and was plotted against the light intensity used in the photocatalytic disinfection experiments in fig 6c and table 1 it is clearly seen that the ahucn photocatalysts exhibited the best comprehensive catalytic bacterial disinfection rate under simulated solar light irradiation and a superior visible light bactericidal activity as compared with the other g c3n4 based photocatalysts reported previously 4 discussions 4 1 working species generally various reactive species rss such as e o2 h2o2 h and oh which are produced in situ during the photocatalytic process could be responsible for the destruction of the microorganisms chen et al 2011 to determine which reactive species play a dominant role in the photocatalytic disinfection process by ahucn different trapping experiments were carried out for various rss as shown in fig 7 a with the addition of tempol o2 scavenger ammonium oxalate h scavenger and isopropanol oh scavenger the survival ratio of e coli cells did not change much compared to the survival curve with no scavenger implying o2 h and oh are not directly involved in the photocatalytic inactivation process when cr vi e scavenger was added the inactivation efficiency was moderately decreased suggesting that e played some or a minor role in the photocatalytic disinfection process more strikingly h2o2 scavenger edta fe ii significantly inhibited the photocatalytic bacterial inactivation indicating in situ h2o2 is the dominant species involved in the photocatalytic inactivation with the ahucn system to further clarify the role of e in the photocatalytic inactivation the photocatalytic disinfection was conducted under anaerobic conditions ar bubbling in which any influence of reactive oxidative species was eliminated leaving only the function of e in the photocatalytic disinfection the results in fig 7b showed that the photocatalytic disinfection was conspicuously inhibited which clearly demonstrated that the e alone did not directly inactivate the bacterial cells based on the above findings it is therefore postulated that the photocatalytic disinfection activity of ahucn was caused mainly by the h2o2 generated when most e reacted with the oxygen species as listed in eqns 3 5 below 3 o 2 e o 2 4 o 2 e 2 h h 2 o 2 5 o 2 2 e 2 h h 2 o 2 to test this postulation the concentration of in situ formed h2o2 in the test solution was further examined by a colorimetric dpd method under visible light illumination fig 8 a shows the in situ formed h2o2 concentrations in the test solution under visible light illumination by the as synthesized bcn hucn and ahucn photocatalysts respectively in all three cases the h2o2 concentration increased with light exposure time at first and then became relatively stable with prolonged illumination time which is consistent with the process where the h2o2 is continuously produced and consumed dynamically after two hours of visible light illumination the h2o2 concentration from the ahucn photocatalysis was about 2 times and 5 times higher than those obtained from the hucn and bcn respectively while these results generally agree with the hypothesis above the much higher concentrations of h2o2 over ahucn may entail a distinctly different molecular o2 activation process than those on bcn and hucn surfaces 4 2 ros production pathway in the aqueous photocatalysis there are two possible pathways for oxygen reduction by photoexcited electrons including a sequential two step single electron transfer process eqs 3 4 and one step two electron direct reduction route eqs 5 to produce h2o2 zhang et al 2015 to further clarify the molecular o2 activation pathways on ahucn surfaces linear sweep voltammetry lsv studies taken by using the rotating disk electrode rde were performed fig 8b shows the rde curves of ahucn at different rotating speeds the average number of electrons n involved in the process of o2 reduction was subsequently analyzed by employing the koutecky levich equation as described above eqn 1 2 from the linearly fitted plots of log ik versus the overpotentials in fig 8c the average electron transfer number n for the o2 reduction was 1 93 for ahucn with the same method the average electron transfer number n for the o2 reduction of bcn and hucn was calculated to be 1 23 and 1 13 respectively as shown in figure s4 fig 8d shows the koutecky levich plots of as synthesized samples obtained at a constant electrode potential 0 8 v which clearly demonstrated that the ahucn photocatalysts indeed selectively promotes two electron reduction of o2 while bcn and hucn followed the single electron reduction of o2 therefore as for ahucn photocatalysts this result further implies a significant change of o2 reduction process on the g c3n4 surface after surface amination this change in the photocatalytic o2 reduction process evidently has resulted in a much accelerated production of the h2o2 as observed in fig 8a 4 3 charge separation and transfer in addition to the increased production rate of the primary bactericidal species surface functionalization has also influenced the separation and transfer of photoexcited charge carriers as evidenced by the results of the photoelectrochemical pec measurements in fig 9 fig 9a shows mott schottky m s plots of the as synthesized samples the m s curves of all three samples exhibited positive slopes characteristic of the n type semiconductors xu et al 2019 the slope of m s plot was the smallest for the ahucn as compared to bcn and hucn suggesting the highest electron donor density for ahucn a higher donor density is very helpful for improving photocatalytic performance because of the greater concentration of charge carriers and higher electrical conductivity from the intercepts of m s plots with the abscissa the flat band potentials of bcn hucn and ahucn were determined to be about 1 2 1 4 and 1 3 v respectively versus ag agcl consistent with the results derived from xps valence spectra fig 5 tests at three different frequencies of 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 khz all pointed to the same flat band potential of 1 3 v of ahucn in fig 9b further attesting to the accuracy of the above experimental results the electrical conductivities of the samples were measured by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis as shown in fig 9c ahucn shows a much smaller arc radius especially under light illumination than those of bcn and ahucn indicating that it has a lower resistance or a faster interfacial charge carrier transfer a similar tendency was also obtained in photoelectric response measurement as displayed in fig 9d all of the electrodes exhibited a sensitive photocurrent response under several on off cycles of intermittent visible light irradiation compared to bcn and hucn the ahucn photoelectrode shows a much higher photocurrent response suggesting the great enhancement of the transfer and separation of photon generated carriers therefore based on the above analysis it is concluded that the introduction of abundant amino groups and the highly porous structure of ahucn can not only provide a large surface area for accommodating active sites but also can greatly enhance the separation of charge carriers as well as the kinetics of charge transfer the greater separation of the photo generated charge carriers means that more photo generated electrons could participate in the production of the h2o2 while faster transfer of the photo electrons would lead directly to higher h2o2 production rate both effects were combined to produce the most h2o2 from the ahucn sample fig 8a 4 4 photocatalytic performance enhancement h2o2 is a widely known biocide against common bacteria especially on e coli linley et al 2012 the biocidal action may follow several pathways direct oxidization of sulfur atoms protein carbonylation and production of highly damaging hydroxyl radicals through the fenton reaction when h2o2 reacts with the ferrous ions in the e coli cell imlay 2003 recent photocatalytic study has also shown that the in situ photo generated h2o2 can directly destroy the cell membrane and dna during the photocatalytic processes shi et al 2015 while the exact pathways by which the photo generated h2o2 on the surface of ahucn may act to destroy e coli cells are yet to be ascertained the rapid bacterial killing kinetics demonstrated by ahucn suggest that the production of the oh radicals by the fenton reaction and direct destruction of the cell membrane and dna may play significant roles in the photocatalytic disinfection it should be noted that the ferrous ions needed for the fenton reaction may reside in the interior of the bacterial cell so that the external oh trapping agent isopropanol applied in the trapping experiments discussed in section 4 1 above may not be effective in offsetting the antimicrobial effect of the fenton reaction moreover since the fenton reaction is known to be highly sensitive to uv radiation some of the accelerated bacterial killing kinetics under am1 5 radiation may have resulted from the faster fenton reaction catalyzed by the uv in am1 5 light source based on the experimental observations above it is clear that the photocatalytic disinfection activity of ahucn was derived from the in situ photo generated h2o2 and that the significantly enhanced photocatalytic disinfection activities of ahucn could be attributed to an excellent combination of their unique holey ultrathin structure and the structural characteristics of amino rich surface as schematically illustrated in fig 10 on the one hand the unique holey ultrathin structure of ahucn can expose more surface active sites and greatly reduce the recombination of the photo induced carriers by shortening their diffusion paths from bulk to surface this explained why hucn showed a superior photocatalytic activity than the bcn as demonstrated in their photocatalytic disinfection of e coli cells furthermore in order to obtain a good photocatalytic activity the photogenerated electron hole pairs which have diffused to the photocatalyst surface must stay separated and react with the target reactants efficiently the abundant amino groups present on the surface of ahucn could greatly improve the charge mobility along the interface between the photocatalyst and the target reactants and then react with oxygen to produce ros such as h2o2 last but not least the amino rich surface of ahucn could switch the oxygen activation from one electron reduction to two electron reduction process by accelerating the rate of two electron transfer process as compared with bcn and hucn photocatalysts which affords the ahucn with the strongest photocatalytic bactericidal activity 5 conclusions in summary we have demonstrated that rapid photocatalytic inactivation of e coli could be achieved in graphitic carbon nitride by controlling the photocatalytic pathway through surface functionalization of porous nanosheets the resulting amino rich porous ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets offered faster charge transfer kinetics and reduced recombination for photo induced carriers rde measurement results have revealed that the presence of numerous surface amino groups could promote the h2o2 generation through a one step two electron direct reduction pathway of o2 instead of the slower two step single electron process in non functionalized g c3n4 based on the experimental analysis result it is concluded that the superior photocatalytic disinfection performance of ahucn is due to the synergistic advantages of their unique holey ultrathin nanosheet structure and the amino rich surface in providing more active reaction sites in separating photogenerated electrons and holes from recombination in accelerating the photoelectron transfer and most importantly in increasing photocatalytic h2o2 production in light of the findings above this work not only provides some new strategies to construct metal free g c3n4 based photocatalysts but also underlines the significance of the surface functionalization in the photocatalytic disinfection process which could help design

16988,metal free polymeric carbon nitride c3n4 photocatalysts offer attractive technological advantages over the conventional transition metal oxides or sulfides based photocatalysts in water disinfection but their antimicrobial activities are limited by their rapid charge carrier recombination and low specific surface areas by controlling photocatalytic pathways we obtained in amino rich holey ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets ahucn a highly efficient inactivation rate against e coli which is the highest among the monolithic g c3n4 and exceeds the antibacterial performance of the most of the previously reported g c3n4 based photocatalysts both the experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the high photocatalytic disinfection performance of ahucn was derived from the synergistic advantages of their unique holey ultrathin structure and the amino rich surface in controlling the charge separation and transfer and most importantly in increasing the photo production of the dominant antibacterial species h2o2 from the analysis of the reactive oxygen species and rotating disk electrode rde measurements it was found that the presence of abundant surface amino groups enabled the switch of the oxygen reduction pathway from the two step single electron indirect reduction on holey ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets hucn to the one step two electron direct reduction on ahucn the switch of the h2o2 production pathway not only facilitated the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs but also promoted the generation of reactive oxygen species greatly enhancing photocatalytic disinfection efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords g c3n4 nanosheets holey ultrathin structure surface functionalization photocatalytic disinfection 1 introduction with significant industrialization and rapid population growth a large number of pathogenic microorganisms associated with industrial wastewater domestic sewage and livestock waste are released into the natural water posing a great threat to human life and health wang et al 2017 kaper et al 2004 daub et al 2020 recently according to the world health organization who human transmissions of microbial pathogens from drinking water and consequent illness are widespread in countries at all levels of economic development who 2019 to disinfect water of pathogenic microorganisms there have been developed various traditional disinfection technologies including chlorination ozone and ultraviolet uv liu et al 2016 wang et al 2012 however their high cost long treatment time and production of harmful disinfection by products have raised serious cost and health concerns recently limiting their future applications in water treatment practice yang et al 2013 sharma et al al 2014 therefore novel approaches are needed for the removal of pathogenic microorganisms from drinking water with high efficiency economic feasibility and environmental friendliness since the first discovery of matsunaga and co workers on photocatalytic inactivation of microbial cells over tio2 matsunaga et al 1985 photocatalytic disinfection technology has attracted great research interest due to its nontoxicity and mild reaction conditions in this process electrons and holes are generated on the surface of photocatalysts when the photocatalytic materials are excited by light they react with the o2 and oh absorbed on near the surface of the photocatalyst to produce various reactive oxygen species ross such as oh o2 and h2o2 which then act to cause the destruction of the microorganisms foster et al 2011 dalrymple et al 2010 maness et al 1999 although a considerable amount of effort has been contributed to the development of photocatalysts for bacterial inactivation in the past decades significant challenges remain pelaez et al 2012 foremost among them is the low photocatalytic efficiency of the current photocatalysts which so far are largely concentrated on transition metal oxides or sulfides photocatalysts m n chong et al 2010 to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency numerous methods have been used such as compositional doping heterojunctions nanostructure design and surface modifications all with limited success habibi yangjeh et al 2020 m n chong et al 2010 moreover most of them would increase the complexity and cost of the operation some photocatalysts specially those with proven strong antiviral activity contain heavy metals e g cu ag the ionic form of which may be released into treated water raising significant health concerns wang et al 2013 hou et al 2010 thus it would be highly desirable to design new photocatalysts with superior performance but free of toxic metals it would be equally important if the catalyst should have distinct structural characteristics to facilitate investigation of its catalytic disinfection mechanism so that mechanistic design of new superior photocatalysts will soon approach a reality owing to its fascinating properties such as tunable structures versatile surface functional groups and low cost processibility organic semiconductor based photocatalysts have attracted much attention in recent years rojas and horcajada 2020 zhang et al 2016 vyas et al 2016 noteworthy among them polymeric carbon nitride c3n4 has emerged as the most promising candidate for metal free photocatalysts in water disinfection by virtue of their appealing electronic structure abundance tunable optical and electronic properties chemical stability and environment benign characteristics zeng et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 since huang et al reported first that g c3n4 could be applied in the photocatalytic disinfection by inactivation of e coli under visible light irradiation huang et al 2014 this metal free semiconductor photocatalyst and its modified forms have gained more attention as potential antimicrobial agents unfortunately two major challenges namely low photocatalytic efficiency and limited surface active sites have greatly hindered their applications in water disinfection one possible route to improving the photocatalytic efficiency of g c3n4 is to obtain porous ultrathin structure as the porous nature can supply a lager surface area and expose more active sites while the ultrathin structure may greatly shorten the migration distance of charge carriers from bulk to surface which will greatly reduce the recombination possibility wen et al 2017 ong et al 2016 for instance zhao et al demonstrated that 2 107 cfu ml 1 of e coli could be killed completely within 4 h in the presence of single layer g c3n4 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation zhao et al 2014 xiao et al found that as prepared porous few layer c3n4 exhibited ultrahigh redox activity and selectivity than bulk counterpart xiao et al 2019 in addition amino functionalized photocatalytic materials are reported to have good catalytic activities very recently liu et al 2015 li et al 2016 it is believed that amino nitrogen components not only can remarkably promote the interfacial electron transfer but also enhance the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules because of their abundant localized electrons fu et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 it is therefore postulated that by combining amino modification with porous ultrathin structure the amino functionalized holey ultrathin g c3n4 ahucn may hold great promise to be a strong metal free photocatalyst for water disinfection accordingly we synthesized amino rich porous ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets ahucn by a sequential polycondensation thermally induced exfoliation and subsequent chemical hydrolysis process the as prepared sample showed a remarkable activity in photocatalytic disinfection on e coli under am1 5g irradiation which was superior to the previously reported monolithic and composite g c3n4 photocatalysts while the photocatalytic activity clearly benefited from the porous ultrathin structure surprisingly the photocatalytic pathway was redirected from the two step single electron indirect oxygen reduction to the one step two electron direct oxygen reduction by the abundant surface amino groups on ahucn the switch of the photocatalytic pathway greatly accelerated the generation of the primary bactericidal species h2o2 reactive oxygen species resulting in greatly enhanced photocatalytic disinfection rate 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals all chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification melamine polyethylene glycol peg mw 10000 and concentrated hydrochloric acid were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent corporation shanghai china deionized di water 18 2 mω was produced by an ultrapure water system 2

and melamine 5 00 g were dispersed in distilled water 30 ml under continuous stirring until the solution became transparent then the mixture was dried at 80 c in vacuum for 12 h to ensure the water

the as synthesized ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets were further thermally treated at 520 c in an open system for 4 5 h at a heating rate of 5 cmin 1 the obtained light yellow powder was denoted as the holey ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets hucn finally 100 mg hucn and 10 ml 37 concentrated hydrochloric acid were added into 50 ml flask and the mixture continuously stirred for 4 h at 37 c after the reaction the products were centrifuged washed several times until the liquid supernatant reached neutral ph and dried at 40 c for 12 h in a vacuum oven to obtain the final product of the amino rich holey ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets ahucn photocatalysts for comparison the bulk g c3n4 bcn was prepared by the thermal polycondensation of melamine at 550 c in a semi closed system for 4 h 2 3

electrochemical analysis photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted at room temperature on a three electrode system that includes a working electrode a platinum counter electrode and a ag agcl reference electrode sce by using a chi 660d electrochemical workstation the working electrodes were prepared by electroplating as synthesized photocatalysts on the fto sno2 f substrates the electrolyte used was 0 2 m na2so4 solution the rotating disk electrode analysis was performed on gamry instrument potentiostat reference 600 with a three electrode cell system in which ag agcl

american type culture collection manassas va usa were used for photocatalytic disinfection experiments the bacterial cells were incubated in nutrient broth at 37 c for 12 h after centrifugation they were washed twice using a buffer solution 0 05 m kh2po4 and 0 05 m k2hpo4 ph 7 0 and diluted to a cell suspension of ca 3 108 cfu ml in buffer solution prior to the use for photocatalytic disinfection experiments in the photocatalytic disinfection of e coli experiment 10 mg photocatalyst and 3 ml buffer solution were first added into 5 ml centrifuge tube and dispersed ultrasonically for 5 min then 3 ml of the photocatalyst mixture and 7 ml e coli suspension were added into the petri dish so that the final cell density and photocatalyst concentration were adjusted to about 3 107 cfu ml and 1 g l respectively the reaction mixture so formed was exposed to the visible light and am1 5 g solar light irradiation for the determination of the photocatalytic disinfection activities of the photocatalyst samples for the photocatalysis experiment the light source was a 300 w xe arc lamp plssxe300 beijing trusttech co ltd beijing china equipped with an air mass 1 5 global filter am 1 5 g or uv cutoff filter λ 400 nm the average visible irradiation intensity was measured to be about 47 mw cm2 before the photocatalytic treatment the suspension was stirred in dark for 15 min during the photocatalysis test the reaction mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer throughout the experiment at different time intervals 100 μl of aliquots of the powder treated cell suspensions were collected and turned to appropriate dilutions in buffer solution then three aliquots of 100 μl suspensions were immediately spread onto three agar medium plates and incubated at 37 c for 24 h finally the number of viable cells in terms of colony forming units was counted for comparison control experiments were also conducted in the dark with the photocatalyst and under light illumination only without photocatalyst while the other experimental conditions were the same 2 6 measurements of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 concentration the in situ photogenerated h2o2 concentration was determined by a colorimetric dpd method in which the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd is oxidized by the horseradish peroxidase pod catalyzed oxidation reaction bader et al 1988 typically 0 1 g dpd and 10 mg pod were firstly dissolved in 10 ml of 0 1 m h2so4 solution and 10 ml di water respectively for the detection of h2o2 concentration aliquots 5 ml of irradiated catalyst solution was pipetted into a 10 ml test tube and then mixed with 0 5 ml phosphate buffer solution 0 5 m kh2po4 and 0 5 m k2hpo4 subsequently 50μl dpd solution and 50μl pod solution were added into the mixture solution in sequence after shaking for 10 s and then settling for 30 s the above solution was subjected to the uv vis spectrum measurement the h2o2 concentration was quantified by the uv 2550 spectrophotometer monitoring the absorption maximum at λmax of 551 nm 3 results 3 1 synthesis of holey ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets the amino rich holey ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets ahucn were synthesized by thermal condensation and chemical etching as depicted schematically in fig 1 briefly layered precursors were first prepared from melamine and polyethylene glycol peg mw 10 000 reagents the layered structure may be due to the easy deposition of melamine along the direction of the uniform and ordered chain structure of peg via the formation of nh o hydrogen bonds the direct calcination of the layered precursors then resulted in ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets as previously reported xing et al 2016 with further thermal oxidation the ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets were thermally etched into the hucn as some cn species in the g c3n4 matrix were selectively removed or etched upon exposing to concentrated hydrochloric acid the abundant c n motifs and c n defects in the hucn framework were further chemically etched resulting in ahucn ong et al 2015 huang et al 2018 3 2 structural and compositional analysis the crystal structures of the as prepared samples were determined by x ray diffraction xrd as indicated in fig 2 a two peaks were observed in the bcn sample at 13 1 and 27 4 corresponding to 100 and 002 planes of g c3n4 jcpds 87 1526 respectively han et al 2017 the same two peaks were also seen in the hucn and ahucn samples but the peak intensities were weakened substantially implying the nanocrystalline and or amorphous nature of g c3n4 after the secondary thermal oxidation both peaks for the ahucn were nearly the same as those for the hucn as the final chemical etching was expected to have very little effect on the crystal structure in all cases the characteristic 002 peak which came from interlayer periodic stacking along the c axis in g c3n4 was quite broad indicating that only a few graphitic atomic layers were formed in the individual g c3n4 moreover the 002 peak of ahucn was shifted from 27 4 to 28 1 reflecting a stronger interaction between the adjacent layers the peak at 13 1 originated from the repeated in planar structural packing was much weaker for the hucn and ahucn suggesting that the secondary thermal oxidation step might have disturbed the intralayer long range atomic order and introduced structural defects the molecular structures of the as prepared samples were examined by the fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy as shown in fig 2b all three samples had almost the same ftir spectra indicating that the ahucn maintained a similar chemical structure as those of the bulk and hucn the absorption peak at around 810 cm 1 could be attributed to the breathing mode of tri s triazine ring the peaks in the region from 900 to 1800 cm 1 were caused by the stretching vibrations of the heptazine heterocyclic ring the broad peaks between 3000 and 3600 cm 1 were from n h stretching han et al 2018 the compositions and chemical states of ahucn were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as observed in xps survey spectra fig 3 a ahucn is mainly composed of c n and o the fairly small o 1 s peaks could be attributed to surface adsorbed oxygen containing species liang et al 2015 for closer examinations of c and n peaks high resolution xps scans over c 1 s and n 1 s of the as prepared hucn and ahucn samples were obtained as shown in fig 3b the high resolution xps scans over c 1 s of both hucn and ahucn contained three components located at 284 6 286 0 and 287 9 ev assigned to the graphitic carbon n c n coordination in the framework of g c3n4 and cnhx x 1 2 on the edges of heptazine units respectively yu et al 2017 the high resolution scans over n 1 s peak are shown in fig 3c where the typical g c3n4 xps n 1 s spectrum could be deconvoluted into four peaks with binding energies of 398 6 399 8 400 9 and 404 0 ev corresponding to the c n c groups n c 3 groups nhx groups and positive charge localization in heptazine framework respectively liang et al 2015 in fig 3c while the hucn sample had a typical g c3n4 n 1 s spectrum for the ahucn sample there was a slight shift of the n c 3 groups toward lower binding energy this shift was apparently induced by the distortion of the g c3n4 lattice after chemical etching by integrating the areas under individual peaks atomic ratios of the chemical species on the sample surfaces were calculated and the calculated results are tablulated in fig 3d fig 3d clearly shows that the surface c n atomic ratio increased drastically from 0 76 in the bcn to 0 83 in the hucn pointing to the preferred loss of nitrogen atoms during the thermal etching process however with further chemical etching the c n atomic ratio in ahucn was not increased but lowered to be close to 3 4 of the stoichiometric g c3n4 this means some extra carbon atoms were lost from the pristine ahucn during the chemical etching process to further investigate the effects of concentrated hydrochloric acid treatment on the surface elemental composition of ahucn the gaussian lorentzian functions were applied to calculate the contents of chemical bonds in as prepared samples as listed in fig 3d the mole percentage of nhx groups in ahucn was about 1 8 times higher than that of hucn suggesting the introduction of surface amidogen in addition compared to hucn the mole percentage of cnhx increases from 0 92 in hucn to 1 4 in ahucn further confirming the formation of amidogen after concentrated hydrochloric acid treatment thus based on the xps results we can infer that some of the c atoms were removed by the concentrated hydrochloric acid treatment leading to the formation of c vacancies the presence of a c vacancy then leaves the two coordinated n atoms with unbonded electrons and in an atmosphere abundant of protons the h could bond with those n atoms to produce amidogen groups based on the above analysis a possible surface structure of ahucn samples is illustrated in figure s1 supporting information 3 3 microscopic morphology to observe the microscopic morphology of as prepared samples field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and transmission electron microscopy tem images were taken and presented in figure s2 supplementary supporting information and fig 4 a b the morphology of the as prepared bcn samples was a typical thick layered stacked structure figure s2 a c for the hucn samples sheet like nanostructures were observed along with a large number of holes throughout the in plane of nanosheets figure s2 b moreover the basic sheet was slightly bent and its edges were ragged as the individual sheet attempted to minimize its surface energy xiao et al 2019 the ultrathin holey structures of hucn can be also confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy tem image as shown in figure s2 d the sem and tem images of ahucn shown in fig 4a b demonstrated that the ahucn also had a ultrathin holey structural features however the surface of ahucn becomes much rougher owing to the chemical etching which is markedly different from the smooth surface morphology of hucn inset in figure s2 b the pore structures and brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface areas of the as synthesized samples were further characterized by n2 adsorption desorption measurements at 77 4 k as shown in fig 4c ahucn exhibits a representative type iv curve with a high adsorption capacity at high relative pressures indicating the highly porous structure of ahucn moreover the bet surface area of ahucn was determined to be 94 35 m2 g 1 which is almost 3 times higher than that of bcn 22 32 m2 g 1 and slightly less than that of hucn 127 22 m2 g 1 the smaller bet of ahucn as compared to that of hucn may be attributed to the agglomeration of the nanosheets enhanced by the amino rich surface insert images in fig 4c show the pore size distributions which revealed the presence of abundant meso and macropores in ahucn in agreement with the tem analysis the thickness of as synthesized ahucn samples was further investigated by atomic force microscopy afm as shown in fig 4d thicknesses of the nanosheet was approximately 3 nm which amounts to about ten atomic layers of c n it should be noted that the highly porous structure of few layer c3n4 and its large surface area can accommodate more active sites which are beneficial for improving photocatalytic performance 3 4 optical properties and electronic structures the optical properties of the as synthesized photocatalysts were examined by measuring the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrum drs fig 5 a shows the light absorbance of the three photocatalysts from the reflectance data optical absorbance could be approximated by the kubelka munk function tauc et al 1966 accordingly their band gap values could be calculated by the construction of tauc plots f r hv n vs hv from the light absorbance data as shown in fig 5b bcn photocatalyst demonstrated the characteristic spectrum with the fundamental absorbance stopping edge at 460 nm and the corresponding band gap was determined at 2 78 ev however both of the hucn and ahucn nanoparticles exhibited a blue shift of the absorption edge compared with bcn and their corresponding band gaps were determined at 3 0 and 2 98 ev respectively the increased bandgap can be attributed to the strong quantum confinement effect caused by the nature of ultrathin holey nanosheets moreover both hucn and ahucn photocatalysts produced clear light absorption tails which could be caused by the presence of defects in the structure finally it is worth noting that the light absorbance of the ahucn exhibited a slight shift towards the long wave which could be ascribed to the abundant amino groups present on the surface of the ahucn xps valence band spectra were used to further quantify the electronic band structure of the as synthesized samples as shown in fig 5c the value of valence band maximum vb max of bcn hucn and ahucn were found to be 1 5 1 3 and 1 6 ev respectively compared to bcn the vb potential of hucn was upshifted by about 0 20 ev which could be attributed to the presence of defects in the structure combined with the results of uv vis drs the valence band spectra allowed the calculations of the band structures of the three photocatalysts as illustrated in fig 5d where the band alignments of as synthesized samples referred to the redox potentials of photocatalytic reduction and oxidation are schematically given from the calculations the conduction band cb bottom of bcn hucn and ahucn samples were found to be 1 28 1 7 and 1 38 ev vs sce respectively it should be noted that the 0 20 ev downshift of the conduction band may be caused by carbon vacancies of ahucn and the formation of amino groups on the surface of ahucn as compared to hucn this is confirmed by ab initio calculations of the conjugated melem models figure s3 based on the time dependent density functional theory td dft performed within the gaussian03 program 3 5 photocatalytic disinfection a common pathogenic microorganism e coli was chosen to evaluate the photocatalytic disinfection activity in terms of the survival ratio of e coli nt n0 where n0 and nt are the numbers of colony forming units at the initial and each following time interval respectively fig 6 a shows the e coli survival ratio under a m 1 5 g light illumination with various treatments without light illumination the bacterial concentration remained unchanged in the dark suggesting that no toxic effect of ahucn to e coli cells control experiments were also conducted with only a m 1 5 g irradiation but no photocatalyst presence after 30 min light illumination the survival ratio of e coli cells was slightly decreased which could be ascribed to the well known bactericidal effect of the ultraviolet radiation in the full spectrum of sunlight notably with light irradiation plus photocatalyst the e coli survival ratio dropped drastically to 10 7 with 3 107 cfu ml 1 of e coli killed completely in just 30 min this represents the highest bacterial killing rate so far reported for g c3n4 based photocatalysts table 1 which clearly demonstrated the high efficiency of ahucn photocatalysts in the photocatalytic disinfection with the uv removed fig 6b shows the e coli survival curves under the visible light illumination without photocatalysts or just with photocatalysts no clear bactericidal effect was observed indicating no photolysis of bacterial cells under visible light irradiation alone and no toxic effect of all the photocatalysts to e coli cells when bcn photocatalyst was used just a moderate photocatalytic disinfection effect on e coli cells was observed under the visible light illumination the survival ratio of e coli cells just fell to 10 2 after 2 h photocatalysis with hucn photocatalyst a stronger bactericidal effect was measured under visible light illumination after 2 h treatment the survival ratio of e coli cells over hucn was decreased to 2 10 4 which was 2 magnitudes lower than bcn counterparts this could be mainly attributed to the high photogenerated carrier separation efficiency caused by the ultrathin holey structure of hucn when the ahucn was irradiated by the visible light the survival ratio of e coli cells dropped sharply and continuously with the increase of the exposure time until complete inactivation of e coli was observed after 2 h treatment the average e coli inactivation rate of the ahucn sample was more than 3 logs and 5 logs faster than the hucn and bcn samples the differences clearly show that the porous ultrathin structure combined with abundant amino groups on the surface of ahucn could largely enhance the photocatalytic disinfection activity of the ahucn sample for comparisons the average rate of photocatalytic disinfection was calculated in terms of the ratio of the log reduction of the bacterial concentration over photocatalytic time and was plotted against the light intensity used in the photocatalytic disinfection experiments in fig 6c and table 1 it is clearly seen that the ahucn photocatalysts exhibited the best comprehensive catalytic bacterial disinfection rate under simulated solar light irradiation and a superior visible light bactericidal activity as compared with the other g c3n4 based photocatalysts reported previously 4 discussions 4 1 working species generally various reactive species rss such as e o2 h2o2 h and oh which are produced in situ during the photocatalytic process could be responsible for the destruction of the microorganisms chen et al 2011 to determine which reactive species play a dominant role in the photocatalytic disinfection process by ahucn different trapping experiments were carried out for various rss as shown in fig 7 a with the addition of tempol o2 scavenger ammonium oxalate h scavenger and isopropanol oh scavenger the survival ratio of e coli cells did not change much compared to the survival curve with no scavenger implying o2 h and oh are not directly involved in the photocatalytic inactivation process when cr vi e scavenger was added the inactivation efficiency was moderately decreased suggesting that e played some or a minor role in the photocatalytic disinfection process more strikingly h2o2 scavenger edta fe ii significantly inhibited the photocatalytic bacterial inactivation indicating in situ h2o2 is the dominant species involved in the photocatalytic inactivation with the ahucn system to further clarify the role of e in the photocatalytic inactivation the photocatalytic disinfection was conducted under anaerobic conditions ar bubbling in which any influence of reactive oxidative species was eliminated leaving only the function of e in the photocatalytic disinfection the results in fig 7b showed that the photocatalytic disinfection was conspicuously inhibited which clearly demonstrated that the e alone did not directly inactivate the bacterial cells based on the above findings it is therefore postulated that the photocatalytic disinfection activity of ahucn was caused mainly by the h2o2 generated when most e reacted with the oxygen species as listed in eqns 3 5 below 3 o 2 e o 2 4 o 2 e 2 h h 2 o 2 5 o 2 2 e 2 h h 2 o 2 to test this postulation the concentration of in situ formed h2o2 in the test solution was further examined by a colorimetric dpd method under visible light illumination fig 8 a shows the in situ formed h2o2 concentrations in the test solution under visible light illumination by the as synthesized bcn hucn and ahucn photocatalysts respectively in all three cases the h2o2 concentration increased with light exposure time at first and then became relatively stable with prolonged illumination time which is consistent with the process where the h2o2 is continuously produced and consumed dynamically after two hours of visible light illumination the h2o2 concentration from the ahucn photocatalysis was about 2 times and 5 times higher than those obtained from the hucn and bcn respectively while these results generally agree with the hypothesis above the much higher concentrations of h2o2 over ahucn may entail a distinctly different molecular o2 activation process than those on bcn and hucn surfaces 4 2 ros production pathway in the aqueous photocatalysis there are two possible pathways for oxygen reduction by photoexcited electrons including a sequential two step single electron transfer process eqs 3 4 and one step two electron direct reduction route eqs 5 to produce h2o2 zhang et al 2015 to further clarify the molecular o2 activation pathways on ahucn surfaces linear sweep voltammetry lsv studies taken by using the rotating disk electrode rde were performed fig 8b shows the rde curves of ahucn at different rotating speeds the average number of electrons n involved in the process of o2 reduction was subsequently analyzed by employing the koutecky levich equation as described above eqn 1 2 from the linearly fitted plots of log ik versus the overpotentials in fig 8c the average electron transfer number n for the o2 reduction was 1 93 for ahucn with the same method the average electron transfer number n for the o2 reduction of bcn and hucn was calculated to be 1 23 and 1 13 respectively as shown in figure s4 fig 8d shows the koutecky levich plots of as synthesized samples obtained at a constant electrode potential 0 8 v which clearly demonstrated that the ahucn photocatalysts indeed selectively promotes two electron reduction of o2 while bcn and hucn followed the single electron reduction of o2 therefore as for ahucn photocatalysts this result further implies a significant change of o2 reduction process on the g c3n4 surface after surface amination this change in the photocatalytic o2 reduction process evidently has resulted in a much accelerated production of the h2o2 as observed in fig 8a 4 3 charge separation and transfer in addition to the increased production rate of the primary bactericidal species surface functionalization has also influenced the separation and transfer of photoexcited charge carriers as evidenced by the results of the photoelectrochemical pec measurements in fig 9 fig 9a shows mott schottky m s plots of the as synthesized samples the m s curves of all three samples exhibited positive slopes characteristic of the n type semiconductors xu et al 2019 the slope of m s plot was the smallest for the ahucn as compared to bcn and hucn suggesting the highest electron donor density for ahucn a higher donor density is very helpful for improving photocatalytic performance because of the greater concentration of charge carriers and higher electrical conductivity from the intercepts of m s plots with the abscissa the flat band potentials of bcn hucn and ahucn were determined to be about 1 2 1 4 and 1 3 v respectively versus ag agcl consistent with the results derived from xps valence spectra fig 5 tests at three different frequencies of 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 khz all pointed to the same flat band potential of 1 3 v of ahucn in fig 9b further attesting to the accuracy of the above experimental results the electrical conductivities of the samples were measured by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis as shown in fig 9c ahucn shows a much smaller arc radius especially under light illumination than those of bcn and ahucn indicating that it has a lower resistance or a faster interfacial charge carrier transfer a similar tendency was also obtained in photoelectric response measurement as displayed in fig 9d all of the electrodes exhibited a sensitive photocurrent response under several on off cycles of intermittent visible light irradiation compared to bcn and hucn the ahucn photoelectrode shows a much higher photocurrent response suggesting the great enhancement of the transfer and separation of photon generated carriers therefore based on the above analysis it is concluded that the introduction of abundant amino groups and the highly porous structure of ahucn can not only provide a large surface area for accommodating active sites but also can greatly enhance the separation of charge carriers as well as the kinetics of charge transfer the greater separation of the photo generated charge carriers means that more photo generated electrons could participate in the production of the h2o2 while faster transfer of the photo electrons would lead directly to higher h2o2 production rate both effects were combined to produce the most h2o2 from the ahucn sample fig 8a 4 4 photocatalytic performance enhancement h2o2 is a widely known biocide against common bacteria especially on e coli linley et al 2012 the biocidal action may follow several pathways direct oxidization of sulfur atoms protein carbonylation and production of highly damaging hydroxyl radicals through the fenton reaction when h2o2 reacts with the ferrous ions in the e coli cell imlay 2003 recent photocatalytic study has also shown that the in situ photo generated h2o2 can directly destroy the cell membrane and dna during the photocatalytic processes shi et al 2015 while the exact pathways by which the photo generated h2o2 on the surface of ahucn may act to destroy e coli cells are yet to be ascertained the rapid bacterial killing kinetics demonstrated by ahucn suggest that the production of the oh radicals by the fenton reaction and direct destruction of the cell membrane and dna may play significant roles in the photocatalytic disinfection it should be noted that the ferrous ions needed for the fenton reaction may reside in the interior of the bacterial cell so that the external oh trapping agent isopropanol applied in the trapping experiments discussed in section 4 1 above may not be effective in offsetting the antimicrobial effect of the fenton reaction moreover since the fenton reaction is known to be highly sensitive to uv radiation some of the accelerated bacterial killing kinetics under am1 5 radiation may have resulted from the faster fenton reaction catalyzed by the uv in am1 5 light source based on the experimental observations above it is clear that the photocatalytic disinfection activity of ahucn was derived from the in situ photo generated h2o2 and that the significantly enhanced photocatalytic disinfection activities of ahucn could be attributed to an excellent combination of their unique holey ultrathin structure and the structural characteristics of amino rich surface as schematically illustrated in fig 10 on the one hand the unique holey ultrathin structure of ahucn can expose more surface active sites and greatly reduce the recombination of the photo induced carriers by shortening their diffusion paths from bulk to surface this explained why hucn showed a superior photocatalytic activity than the bcn as demonstrated in their photocatalytic disinfection of e coli cells furthermore in order to obtain a good photocatalytic activity the photogenerated electron hole pairs which have diffused to the photocatalyst surface must stay separated and react with the target reactants efficiently the abundant amino groups present on the surface of ahucn could greatly improve the charge mobility along the interface between the photocatalyst and the target reactants and then react with oxygen to produce ros such as h2o2 last but not least the amino rich surface of ahucn could switch the oxygen activation from one electron reduction to two electron reduction process by accelerating the rate of two electron transfer process as compared with bcn and hucn photocatalysts which affords the ahucn with the strongest photocatalytic bactericidal activity 5 conclusions in summary we have demonstrated that rapid photocatalytic inactivation of e coli could be achieved in graphitic carbon nitride by controlling the photocatalytic pathway through surface functionalization of porous nanosheets the resulting amino rich porous ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets offered faster charge transfer kinetics and reduced recombination for photo induced carriers rde measurement results have revealed that the presence of numerous surface amino groups could promote the h2o2 generation through a one step two electron direct reduction pathway of o2 instead of the slower two step single electron process in non functionalized g c3n4 based on the experimental analysis result it is concluded that the superior photocatalytic disinfection performance of ahucn is due to the synergistic advantages of their unique holey ultrathin nanosheet structure and the amino rich surface in providing more active reaction sites in separating photogenerated electrons and holes from recombination in accelerating the photoelectron transfer and most importantly in increasing photocatalytic h2o2 production in light of the findings above this work not only provides some new strategies to construct metal free g c3n4 based photocatalysts but also underlines the significance of the surface functionalization in the photocatalytic disinfection process which could help design

16989,the interaction of as iii with micron sized mechanochemically sulfidated zero valent iron s mzvibm has been studied under both anoxic and oxic conditions the as iii removal capacity varied with the increase of s fe molar ratio under anoxic conditions while it continuously decreased under oxic conditions a series of sequential extractions x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy analyses were used to investigate as iii removal mechanisms in the absence of oxygen as iii was removed from solution primarily through the formation of as4s4 with less than half of the removal resulting from the adsorption of as iii as v and feass precipitation under oxic conditions adsorption onto iron oxyhydr oxides was the dominant mechanism of as iii removal increasing sulfidation decreased particle fe 0 content which resulted in less production of iron oxyhydr oxides and therefore lower as iii removal capacities column experiments showed that less than 2 wt of s mzvibm in sand was able to rapidly reduce the as iii concentration in a real groundwater from 300 to 10 µg l the chinese drinking water standard for up to 750 bv with an ebct of 2 54 min this study demonstrates that s mzvibm is an efficient and cost effective material in treating as contaminated water to ensure water safety graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords anoxic conditions oxic conditions arsenic removal sulfidation zero valent iron 1 introduction arsenic is a highly toxic metalloid commonly arsenic exists as as iii and as v in the environment and the toxicity of as iii is higher than as v korte and fernando 1991 although the world health organization who tightened the guideline of as in drinking water to 10 μg l 1 in 2004 the drinking water of 200 million people around the world still contains high levels of arsenic in countries such as the usa china chile and especially in bangladesh and west bengal in india mohan and pittman 2007 rodriguez lado et al 2013 zero valent iron zvi has been extensively studied as a material to remove aqueous arsenic and the mechanisms in play have been given wide berth kanel et al 2005 lackovic et al 2000 manning et al 2002 su and puls 2001 zhang et al 2018 the mechanism of as iii and as v removal by zvi was first researched by lackovic et al 2000 they observed effective as iii and as v removal under anoxic conditions through surface precipitation or adsorption reactions further studies have revealed that iron corrosion plays a lead role in arsenic removal melitas et al 2002 which is due to the excellent binding ability of fe corrosion products for arsenic an and zhao 2012 farquhar et al 2002 manning et al 2002 when as v was the initial added as species the coexistence of solid phase as iii and as v had been observed which was the result of fe0 and fe2 serving as reducing species under oxic conditions su and puls 2001 elsewhere ramos et al 2009 found the reaction of nano zero valent iron nzvi with as iii generated as 0 as iii and as v species under anoxic conditions implying that both reduction and oxidation processes were operational in other studies as iii was observed to be removed from solution by reduction to as 0 under anoxic conditions while under oxic conditions adsorption was a more important process bang et al 2005 sulfidation is an emerging zvi modification method sulfidation refers to the introduction of sulfur into zvi and the added sulfur reacts with fe0 or fe ii in zvi to form another solid phase ferrous sulfides fesx fan et al 2017 the newly generated fesx can be attached to the surface of zvi or iron oxyhydr oxide layer of zvi mixed in zvi or can partially replace the original zvi the sulfidation of zvi facilitates the electron transfer from fe0 to zvi surface gu et al 2017 kim et al 2011 li et al 2018 which greatly improves the reactivity of this material in degrading some of the chlorinated hydrocarbons rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 it also improves the selectivity of electron transfer to target pollutants he et al 2018 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 and reduces the side reaction of hydrogen evolution from zvi by reacting with water fan et al 2016 he et al 2020a xu et al 2020 which means that sulfidation can improve the long term effect of zvi and reduce processing costs the method of sulfidating zvi mainly uses sulfur containing chemical reagents such as sulfide dithionite or thiosulfate etc cai et al 2021 fan et al 2017 to prepare sulfidated nanoscale zero valent iron s nzvi however because the synthesis of s nzvi is carried out in the water phase part of the fe0 is consumed by the hydrogen evolution reaction with water in addition to that is consumed by sulfidation agents themselves e g dithionite in addition as sulfidation occurs in the dissolved phase particle generation may be accompanied by the generation of toxic gasses such as h2s as well as salty wastewater chemical sulfidation methods also often require expensive and dangerous borohydride as a reducing agent these shortcomings complicate large scale production and application of s nzvi to overcome these shortcomings our group have recently prepared s mzvibm through adding microscale zvi mzvi and sulfur powder into a jar and milled by a planetary ball mill gu et al 2017 this preparation enhanced the activity of mzvi to degrade trichloroethylene and does not use toxic and harmful raw materials sulfidated zvi has been widely studied to remove heavy metals from the aqueous phase due to its outstanding performance in pollutant removal fan et al 2013 2019 huang et al 2018 li et al 2018 su et al 2015 wu et al 2018 zou et al 2019 at present there are few studies on how sulfidation affects the performance and mechanism of arsenic removal by zvi limited literature on the removal of as iii by s nzvi under oxic conditions indicates that there is a clear improvement in arsenic removal performance compared with single component zvi or fes wu et al 2018 however the mechanisms responsible for these observations have not been fully explored for example is sulfur enhanced electron transfer the key to enhanced removal of as if not what role does reduction play the interaction between sulfidated zvi and arsenic under different sulfidation conditions s fe molar ratios is possibly the key to identify the mechanisms of arsenic removal by sulfidated zvi in addition the removal of aqueous as is often desired to be performed in different redox environments for example oxic reaction systems often exist in the process of arsenic wastewater treatment anoxic systems often exist in deep groundwater environments and the interface between oxic and anoxic conditions exists widely in shallow groundwater environments winograd and robertson 1982 yuan et al 2018 however differences in the performance and mechanisms of as removal by sulfidated zvi under anoxic and oxic conditions have not been systematically investigated in this study we have examined the performance of s mzvibm materials with different s fe molar ratio to remove aqueous as iii under both anoxic and oxic conditions the reaction mechanisms between the materials and arsenic have been explored and quantified with the role of sulfur being made explicit a column setup was also established to evaluate the feasibility of efficient as iii removal from real groundwater by s mzvibm under ambient conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used were analytical grade or better further details of the chemicals are provided in the supporting information si ultrapure water was used for all solutions a stock solution of 500 mg l 1 as iii was prepared from naaso2 and preserved at 4 c all of the glassware used in experiments were soaked in 20 hno3 for more than 8 h then underwent ultrasonic cleaning for several minutes and rinsed with ultrapure water thrice before use all solutions used for anoxic experiments were deoxygenated before use by bubbling nitrogen gas for at least one hour then stored in a glovebox 2 2 particle preparation the s mzvibm particles were prepared using the method developed in our group gu et al 2017 briefly the grinding process was carried out in a planetary ball mill with stainless steel jars 100 ml and zirconia balls 6 mm in diameter different ratios of mzvi and elemental sulfur powder s fe 0 2 were mixed and sealed in stainless steel jars with an argon atmosphere the milling was performed at 400 rpm with ar headspace and at room temperature after up to 20 h of milling the s mzvibm particles were formed with the elemental s transformed to fes and collected in an n2 filled glovebag and stored in an argon filled glovebox before use 2 3 reaction systems batch experiments were conducted to determine as iii removal by s mzvibm in both anoxic and oxic environments the initial ph value of the suspensions was adjusted to ph 7 with 1 m hcl or naoh to simulate strict anoxic conditions s mzvibm 0 02 g and 100 ml of as iii solution were sequentially added into 125 ml serum bottles in the glovebox and then covered with aluminum caps containing ptfe butyl rubber septa the bottles were finally kept on a shaker table at 180 rpm and 25 5 c to simulate oxic conditions experiments were carried out with 200 ml as iii solution in 250 ml three necked flasks under 500 rpm continuous mechanical agitation at 25 5 c in the open air during the course of reaction an aliquot of 1 ml suspension was withdrawn at preset times and filtered by a 0 22 μm syringe filter before chemical analyses e g total and as v concentrations the residual solid phase after reaction was collected for characterization hydrogen gas generation under anoxic conditions was monitored by sampling and analyzing h2 in the reactor headspace at preset times for oxic conditions h2 production is difficult to be directly measured because of the open atmospheric environment therefore the following experimental approach was taken oxygenated as iii solution 100 ml was added to 125 ml serum bottles in open atmosphere and then the bottles were sealed with aluminum caps containing ptfe butyl rubber septa placed on a shaker table at 180 rpm and 25 5 c gas extraction from headspace was conducted by syringes at preset times for h2 measurements quenching experiments were carried out in the oxic experiments to determine which reactive oxidants are responsible for the oxidation of as iii to as v tert butyl alcohol tba 0 05 m superoxide dismutase sod 3 u ml 1 dimethylsulfoxide dmso 0 05 m and catalase cat 50 u ml 1 were used as the hydroxyl radical superoxide radical fe iv and hydrogen peroxide scavengers respectively anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 atalla et al 1985 pang et al 2011 2 4 arsenic sequential extraction method the method of as sequential extraction employed in this study was adopted from keon et al 2001 briefly five steps were used to differentiate the following operationally defined solid phase arsenic species ionically bound as or weakly adsorbed as strongly adsorbed as as coprecipitated with amorphous iron oxyhydr oxides as coprecipitated with crystalline iron oxyhydr oxides and as sulfides e g as2s3 as4s4 and feass table s1 the fractions of as associated with the above phases were recovered respectively by the following extractants mgcl2 nah2po4 ammonium oxalate oxalic acid ti iii citrate edta bicarbonate and hno3 detailed procedures of the sequential extraction methodology are listed in the si 2 5 analyses total aqueous as astotal concentrations were determined by atomic fluorescence spectrometry afs 230e and as iii v was measured by high performance liquid chromatography atomic fluorescence spectrometry hplc afs total aqueous iron concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy tas 990 and hydrogen was measured by gas chromatography gc 9790 with a tcd detector solid phase materials were collected and then dried in the glovebox after drying the materials were sealed in hermetic bottles and then packed in sealed bags in the glovebox in this way the bottles and bags were filled with argon which protects the samples from oxidation as much as possible during their shipping to characterization facilities the morphology of the material was derived from scanning electron microscope sem analyses x ray diffraction xrd was used to characterize crystalline phases at a scan rate of 0 1 s using cu kα radiation raman spectroscopy was conducted with a labram hr800 france and a 531 95 nm laser which was used for the analysis of iron oxyhydr oxides species that can t be completely distinguished by xrd the results from xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific usa 20 ev for high resolutions scans were fitted by the version 4 0 xpspeak software to determine the chemical oxidation state of as and fe more details regarding the fitting of xps spectra are provided in the si xanes at the as k edge was also used to investigate as speciation in the solid phases analyses in fluorescence mode were undertaken at room temperature in a 100 helium gas environment on the xas beamline of the australian synchrotron the athena software was used to perform linear combination fitting of the sample spectra to determine as speciation in solid phase with the use of the following standards as4s4 feass as 0 as iii and as v 2 6 column experiments the as iii removal studies were carried out in columns packed with a mixture of sand and s mzvibm the sand 40 60 mesh was purchased from donghai yuanyang quartz sand co jiangsu china and treated following the procedures of johnson et al 1996 before use the details are provided in the si the column used was 15 cm long with an internal diameter of 2 5 cm the first 1 cm at the bottom and 3 cm at the top of the columns were filled with sand as supports the middle part of the column was filled with a mixture of sand and iron materials of 70 g in which the s mzvibm had a weight percentage of 2 the influent was real groundwater collected from a drinking water well in hangzhou city with added as iii of 300 μg l 1 ph 7 6 0 5 the influent was continuously fed into the column in open air do concentration 7 9 mg l and in a bottom to top mode at a rate of 21 3 ml min by a peristaltic pump the corresponding empty bed contact time ebct was 2 54 min the effluent samples were collected at a preset time and analyzed for as concentration to determine the removal efficiency 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle characterization according to our previous study gu et al 2017 adding elemental sulfur during mzvi ball milling can not only form relatively homogeneous fe fes composite through solid solid reaction fe0 s0 fes but also accelerate the erosion of the particles to form smaller particles the addition of small amount of elemental s s fe 0 01 reduced the particle size from 38 0 to 6 3 μm after 20 h milling while the ball milled mzvi i e mzvibm without s0 as a control sample had a particle size of 12 3 μm the bet surface area of the formed s mzvibm was 1 5 m2 g while that of mzvibm was 0 21 m2 g interestingly further increase of s fe molar ratio did not cause further reduction of particle size figure s1 or increase of bet surface area this suggests that the following variation of as iii removal by s mzvibm with different s fe is likely not a consequence of particle size or surface area difference 3 2 kinetics of as iii removal by s mzvibm as iii removal by s mzvibm with different s fe molar ratios was studied and the results are shown in fig 1 s mzvibm removed as iii more efficiently under oxic conditions than under anoxic conditions oxygen plays an important role in the as iii removal by s mzvibm to further analyze the effect of s fe molar ratios on as iii removal under both anoxic and oxic conditions pseudo first order solid line and pseudo second order kinetics dotted line were applied to fit as iii removal kinetics the pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations are provided in the si it can be concluded from the coefficient of determination r2 that both pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic equations provide good fit of the as iii removal kinetics r2 0 94 by s mzvibm under anoxic conditions fig 1a table s2 quasi equilibrium short term as iii removal capacities qe were estimated from the fitting and the results are shown in figure s2a the removal of as iii by mzvibm i e s fe 0 was negligible an increase of s fe molar ratio from 0 to 0 05 resulted in the increase of both as iii removal capability 50 mg g 1 and rate although the incorporation of s resulted in 7 fold increase of particle surface area it cannot explain this level of as iii removal capacity increase and the newly formed fesx phase must contribute to the enhanced as iii removal by s mzvibm however when the s fe molar ratio was increased to 0 1 the as iii removal capability and rate remained stable and actually decreased when the s fe molar ratio was further increased to 0 2 nonetheless compared with mzvibm as iii removal capability was higher at all s fe molar ratios fig 1a the decreased as iii removal by s mzvibm at increased s fe molar ratio after 0 1 is presumably caused by the increased hydrophobicity of the particles as fes is more hydrophobic than iron oxyhydr oxides gu et al 2019 kim et al 2011 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 xu et al 2019 which may reduce the interaction of hydrophilic as iii oxyanion with s mzvibm the increased hydrophobicity of s zvi was also deemed to be the key reason for the reduced nitrate reduction by s zvi compared to its corresponding zvi gong et al 2021 pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics were also used to fit as iii removal kinetics under oxic conditions fig 1b since the as iii removal by mzvibm in 24 h is slower than s mzvibm and exhibits an almost linear curve longer term 72 h sorption experiments were performed to approach quasi equilibrium fig 1b inset the r2 for the pseudo first order kinetic model was the highest for mzvibm in this case table s2 first order kinetics have previously been used to fit as iii and as v removal by zero valent iron under oxic conditions su and puls 2001 sun et al 2014 however the pseudo second order kinetic model provided better fits to the as iii uptake data for s mzvibm regardless of the s fe molar ratio table s2 which suggests that there may be different reaction mechanisms occurring when sulfur is present it is interesting that the observed quasi equilibrium short term as iii removal capacity decreased from 350 to 170 mg g 1 as the s fe molar ratio increased from 0 to 0 2 figure s2b which is completely different to that observed under anoxic conditions and indicates different as iii removal mechanisms under oxic and anoxic conditions 3 3 characterization of reaction products it can be seen in the sem image of figure s3a that the surface of pristine s mzvibm was relatively smooth after reactions under both anoxic and oxic conditions the surface of the particles became coated with reaction products figure s3a figure s3a also shows that the size of the reacted particles under oxic conditions is much larger than that reacted with as iii under anoxic conditions maybe due to the corrosion product aggregation the xrd patterns of the pristine s mzvibm and reaction products under both anoxic and oxic conditions are shown in figure s3b iron oxyhydr oxides fes fes2 and fe0 were all detected in both reaction products compared to the pristine s mzvibm the magnitude of the iron oxyhydr oxide peak was similar after reaction with as iii under anoxic conditions a broad diffraction peak at 21 2θ appeared after reaction with as iii under oxic conditions this peak was attributed to amorphous or nano crystalline iron oxyhydr oxides kanel et al 2006 raman spectroscopy was further used to determine these species of iron oxyhydr oxides figure s3c the raman bands for hematite α fe2o3 219 283 1294 cm 1 akaganeite β feooh 396 cm 1 goethite α feooh 488 cm 1 and feo 598 cm 1 all exist in the spectra of both pristine and reacted s mzvibm particles the raman results suggest that there is no significant change in the species of iron oxyhydr oxides before and after reaction but the raman signal of the materials reacted under anoxic conditions is weaker than those reacted under oxic conditions and also the pristine s mzvibm based on sem xrd and raman spectroscopy data surficial iron oxyhydr oxides were consumed possibly due to chemical dissolution caused by zvi self reduction under anoxic conditions while large quantities of iron oxyhydr oxides were produced under oxic conditions the different structure change is determined by the corrosion of the material which is an electrochemical process talbot and talbot 2018 under oxic conditions oxygen serves as an important electron acceptor to accelerate iron corrosion the chemical forms of as and fe on the surface of the reacted s mzvibm particles were investigated by xps figures s4 and s5 in order to identify the speciation of as under either anoxic or oxic conditions etching depths of 0 to 50 nm were examined the xps as 3d measurements fig 2 a demonstrated that feass and or as 0 both have similar binding energies schaufuss et al 2000 yan et al 2010 as iii o as v o and as2s3 as4s4 were present after s mzvibm was reacted with as iii under anoxic conditions indicating the occurrence of adsorption oxidation reduction and asxsy precipitation the presence of as v 6 under anoxic conditions is possibly caused by as iii oxidation to as v by certain iron oxides formed from fe corrosion manning et al 2002 ramos et al 2009 of these processes adsorption of as iii appeared to be the dominant as iii sequestration process on the particle surface due to the presence of 60 as iii o species as can be seen from the as xps results as a function of etching depth figure s4 table s3 the proportion of asxsy under anoxic conditions decreased from 30 0 at the surface to 5 6 at a 50 nm etching depth in contrast the proportion of as 0 feass increased from 11 1 to 28 7 under oxic conditions as in the iii and v oxidation states made up the largest proportion of as species no as2s3 as4s4 peak was detected under oxic conditions and the as 0 feass peak was also weak at deeper etching depths with its percent contribution to as speciation ranging from 0 to 10 at a depth of 50 nm table s3 these results demonstrate that the proportion of as 0 feass increases with etching depth furthermore the reacted material shell consisted of mixed fe 0 fe ii fe iii phases under anoxic and oxic conditions based on the xps data figure s5 table s4 resulting in a mineral phase distribution of increased fe 0 and fe ii but decreased fe iii content from outside to inside of the particle fig 2b 3 4 as reduction and oxidation mechanisms as iii reduction was observed under both anoxic and oxic conditions based on the xps analyses fig 2a under anoxic conditions reduction played a greater role in as iii removal than under oxic conditions in a zvi h2o system the main reducing agents could include fe 0 fe ii s and atomic hydrogen h s jiao et al 2009 mondal et al 2014 among them h s was considered to have an insignificant role in as iii reduction mondal et al 2014 in our experimental system the relative proportion of fe 0 and fe ii increased with etching depth fig 2b which was correlated with the increased proportion of reduced arsenic species as 0 feas 1 s fig 2a this phenomenon suggests that as iii reduction is associated with the presence of fe 0 and or fe ii fes oxygenation can lead to the formation of h2s or hs which has been reported to be responsible for the reduction of as v to as iii in the fes as v system niazi and burton 2016 in our experiment no solution s species were detected through icp oes and no s0 was observed through xps therefore although the role of s ii as a reductant of as iii cannot be completely ignored gallegos et al 2008 2007 it does not appear to be significant under these conditions as v was mainly detected by xps in samples reacted under oxic conditions this oxidation state was also detected in solution fig 3 a oxidants leading to arsenic oxidation under oxic conditions could include hydrogen peroxide hydroxyl radical fe iv superoxide radical liu et al 2015 pang et al 2011 and possibly sulfur radical species he et al 2020b hydrogen peroxide is generated in two major ways the first is the two electron reduction process in which o2 is reduced to h2o2 directly eq 1 and the other is a one electron reduction in which o2 obtains an electron and generates a superoxide radical eq 2 which can react with divalent iron to generate hydrogen peroxide su et al 2018 eq 3 hydroxyl radicals are mainly derived from the fenton reaction between hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron keenan and sedlak 2008 pang et al 2011 su et al 2018 eq 4 another fenton oxidant could be fe iv pang et al 2011 eq 5 in order to explore the importance of these potential oxidants tba hydroxyl radical quencher sod superoxide radical quencher dmso fe iv quencher and cat hydrogen peroxide quencher were added to identify which of these oxidants mainly influence as iii oxidation as can be seen from the change of as iii astotal ratio in solution with the dose of different scavengers in fig 3 the addition of tba sod or dmso up to 0 4 m had almost no effect on the as iii astotal ratio this implies hydroxyl radical superoxide radical and fe iv may not be the major cause of as iii oxidation despite a small amount of hydroxyl radicals being detected during the reaction figure s6 the cumulative production of hydroxyl radicals in 5 h was only 4 μm which is insignificant compared to the initial as iii concentration of 0 13 mm however when cat was added the aqueous as iii astotal ratio was obviously higher which suggests that arsenic may be predominantly oxidized by h2o2 as iii oxidation mechanisms have been shown to vary with ph in oxic zvi as iii systems katsoyiannis et al 2008 under acidic conditions the hydroxyl radical is mainly responsible for as iii oxidation due to the fenton reaction eq 4 hug and leupin 2003 katsoyiannis et al 2008 under neutral conditions it has been observed that as iii was mainly oxidized by fe iv ding et al 2018 shao et al 2016 nonetheless shao et al 2016 also reported that fe iii as iii complex can be oxidized to fe iii as v complex by h2o2 in oxic fes as iii systems however hydroxyl radicals have been found to considerably contribute to the oxidation of as iii cheng et al 2016 since our experiments were performed under neutral ph and both hydroxyl radical and fe iv were not identified as major oxidants for as iii we hypothesize that the generation of as v in our case was mainly through the pathway of fe iii as iii oxidation by h2o2 our results also suggest that the oxidation of as iii in oxygenated s mzvibm system was mediated more by the presence of mzvi rather than iron sulfides 1 fe 0 o 2 2 h f e 2 h 2 o 2 2 f e 2 o 2 f e 3 o 2 3 f e 2 o 2 2 h f e 3 h 2 o 2 4 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 oh 2 o h 5 fe

01 0 05 0 1 0 2 under anoxic and oxic conditions and the results are presented in fig 4 a these results show that ionically bound as strongly adsorbed as as coprecipitated with iron oxyhydr oxides and as sulfides e g as2s3 as4s4 and feass were found to exist under anoxic conditions in contrast no as sulfides were measured under oxic conditions the formation of as sulfides appears to have been the dominant as iii removal process under anoxic conditions and accounts for approximately 60 80 of total arsenic removed as measured by the sequential extractions this contrasts with the xps results in which more than 60 of the arsenic was found in the form of as iii o bonding fig 2a together these results suggest that arsenite is an important species near the surface of s mzvibm but the bulk speciation is dominated by asxsy or as 0 feass in contrast the major fraction of arsenic removed under oxic conditions was through adsorption and accounted for essentially 100 of the total arsenic removed the results obviously reveal different removal mechanisms between anoxic and oxic conditions there was also a tendency for the removal mechanisms to vary based on the s fe molar ratios of s mzvibm under anoxic conditions with an increase in the s fe molar ratio the proportion of asxsy and as 0 feass initially increased to a maximum at a s fe molar ratio of 0 1 fig 4a and then decreased thereafter interestingly this pattern reflected that of as iii removal capability fig 1a the proportion of asxsy and as 0 feass and adsorbed as iii and as v cannot be distinguished by the sequential extraction results as a result further xanes spectroscopic results were obtained for the reacted materials under anoxic and oxic conditions fig 4b and the fractions of arsenic species formed are summarized in fig 4c an evident peak at 11 869 ev can be observed in the xanes spectra in samples collected under anoxic conditions and could be representative of as4s4 as 0 or feass the inclusion of all three minerals in lcf of the sample data fig 4b and table s5 indicated that as4s4 and feass were the most likely candidates contributing to this peak with a contribution from as 0 if present being less than 4 3 table s6 the distribution of arsenic species after 5 days of reaction with different s fe molar ratio s mzvibm particles in anoxic conditions is shown in fig 4c a small amount of as v can be detected in the xanes spectra which is consistent with the xps results arsenic removal as as iii and as v species decreased with an increase in the molar ratio of s fe demonstrating that the formation of as4s4 became a more important process however when the molar ratio of s fe 0 2 as4s4 decreased to 7 4 mg g 1 and no feass was observed figure s7 indicating that the s mzvibm might have been passivated under oxic conditions however only as iii and as v were detected with an increase in s fe molar ratio the percentage of solid phase as as as iii increased from 39 to 60 and the percentage of as v decreased accordingly table s5 the decrease in the proportion of as v with an increase in the s fe molar ratio demonstrates that the production of oxidizing agents decreased or their ability to oxidize as iii was impaired in some way from our experiments described earlier an important oxidant is likely to be hydrogen peroxide which is produced from the oxidation of zero valent iron eq 1 and fe ii eq 3 a decreasing proportion of as v resulting with an increase in the s fe molar ratio of s mzvibm reveals that the concentration of fe0 used to produce hydrogen peroxide decreased it is noteworthy that the arsenic speciation results derived from the xanes analyses and sequential chemical extraction data are consistent figs 4a and 4c this suggests that the obtained as speciation information for the reacted particles from both analyses are representative 3 6 as iii removal pathway under anoxic and oxic conditions s mzvibm has shown favorable properties for removing as iii from the aqueous phase under both anoxic and oxic conditions and the main difference between them is the utilization of s mzvibm and the removal mode of as iii a conceptual model of the reaction between as iii and s mzvibm under anoxic and oxic conditions is shown in fig 5 as iii removal mechanisms under anoxic and oxic conditions include adsorption coprecipitation with iron oxyhydr oxides kanel et al 2005 oxidation reduction sun et al 2011 and as4s4 feass production bostick and fendorf 2003 kim and batchelor 2009 the formation of as4s4 is the dominant pathway leading to arsenic removal under anoxic conditions while adsorption is the main mechanism under oxic conditions under anoxic conditions both as iii reduction and h2 evolution occurred figure s8 however no hydrogen production was observed under oxic conditions i e electrons from zvi are mainly consumed by oxygen eq 1 6 which produces h2o2 for as iii oxidation 6 2 fe 0 2 h 2 o o 2 2 f e 2 4 o h with a change in s mzvibm s fe molar ratios as iii removal capabilities differed between anoxic and oxic conditions this is most likely due to the different removal mechanisms occurring under the different oxygen conditions in the absence of oxygen arsenic is removed mainly through reduction and the precipitation of as4s4 an initial increase in the s fe molar ratio resulted in an increase in arsenic removal however when the s fe molar ratio was equal to 0 2 the reaction between fes and as was prevented the mechanism behind this passivating effect at high s fe is unclear but merits further investigation under oxic conditions adsorption was the most important as iii removal process and a decrease of fe in the particles i e with an increase in the s fe molar ratio resulted in the reduced formation of iron oxyhydr oxides resulting in decreased as iii removal capability 3 7 as removal from real groundwater in column setup s mzvibm has exhibited excellent as iii removal kinetics and capacity in batch experiments under oxic conditions to evaluate the engineering application of s mzvibm in as iii removal from contaminated groundwater column sorption experiments were carried out under ambient conditions and the effluent histories are recorded fig 6 ball milled mzvi i e s fe 0 was also used as a comparison fig 6 illustrates that s mzvibm s fe 0 1 was highly efficient in removing as iii from real groundwater allowing the rapid reduction of the as concentration from 300 μg l 1 to below 10 μg l 1 the drinking water standard in china up to 750 bed volumes with a ebct of 2 54 min the corresponding as removal capacity was 12 2 mg g 1 for s mzvibm which is higher than most of the reported as iii removal capacity in column setup e g 0 95 mg g for nzvi pumice zeolite ranjan et al 2020 2 3 mg g for iron hydroxide granulates daus et al 2004 in comparison the removal of as iii by mzvibm under the same operational conditions was unsatisfactory the initial effluent concentration was high as 130 μg l 1 and it continued to increase after 400 bed volumes the material cost for treating 1 ton as iii wastewater 300 μg l by s mzvibm s fe 0 1 is estimated to be 0 037 if the material cost and as iii removal capacity are assumed to be 1500 ton and 12 2 mg g 1 respectively the favorable column experiment results along with the low treatment cost suggest that s mzvibm is one of the most promising and cost effective materials in capturing as iii from groundwater and ensure drinking water safety for people even from developing countries 4 conclusion this study applied the use of a ball mill to prepare s mzvibm that possesses good properties for as iii remediation under anoxic and oxic conditions arsenic removal is more efficient in the presence of oxygen therefore this material is best suited for the remediation of oxygenated groundwaters column experiments further confirmed that s mzvibm was able to rapidly reduce as iii concentration in a real groundwater from 300 ug l to drinking water standard for up to 750 bed volumes the material cost for treating 1 ton water using s mzvibm was estimated to be as low as 0 037 therefore this material is very promising in addressing

16989,the interaction of as iii with micron sized mechanochemically sulfidated zero valent iron s mzvibm has been studied under both anoxic and oxic conditions the as iii removal capacity varied with the increase of s fe molar ratio under anoxic conditions while it continuously decreased under oxic conditions a series of sequential extractions x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy analyses were used to investigate as iii removal mechanisms in the absence of oxygen as iii was removed from solution primarily through the formation of as4s4 with less than half of the removal resulting from the adsorption of as iii as v and feass precipitation under oxic conditions adsorption onto iron oxyhydr oxides was the dominant mechanism of as iii removal increasing sulfidation decreased particle fe 0 content which resulted in less production of iron oxyhydr oxides and therefore lower as iii removal capacities column experiments showed that less than 2 wt of s mzvibm in sand was able to rapidly reduce the as iii concentration in a real groundwater from 300 to 10 µg l the chinese drinking water standard for up to 750 bv with an ebct of 2 54 min this study demonstrates that s mzvibm is an efficient and cost effective material in treating as contaminated water to ensure water safety graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords anoxic conditions oxic conditions arsenic removal sulfidation zero valent iron 1 introduction arsenic is a highly toxic metalloid commonly arsenic exists as as iii and as v in the environment and the toxicity of as iii is higher than as v korte and fernando 1991 although the world health organization who tightened the guideline of as in drinking water to 10 μg l 1 in 2004 the drinking water of 200 million people around the world still contains high levels of arsenic in countries such as the usa china chile and especially in bangladesh and west bengal in india mohan and pittman 2007 rodriguez lado et al 2013 zero valent iron zvi has been extensively studied as a material to remove aqueous arsenic and the mechanisms in play have been given wide berth kanel et al 2005 lackovic et al 2000 manning et al 2002 su and puls 2001 zhang et al 2018 the mechanism of as iii and as v removal by zvi was first researched by lackovic et al 2000 they observed effective as iii and as v removal under anoxic conditions through surface precipitation or adsorption reactions further studies have revealed that iron corrosion plays a lead role in arsenic removal melitas et al 2002 which is due to the excellent binding ability of fe corrosion products for arsenic an and zhao 2012 farquhar et al 2002 manning et al 2002 when as v was the initial added as species the coexistence of solid phase as iii and as v had been observed which was the result of fe0 and fe2 serving as reducing species under oxic conditions su and puls 2001 elsewhere ramos et al 2009 found the reaction of nano zero valent iron nzvi with as iii generated as 0 as iii and as v species under anoxic conditions implying that both reduction and oxidation processes were operational in other studies as iii was observed to be removed from solution by reduction to as 0 under anoxic conditions while under oxic conditions adsorption was a more important process bang et al 2005 sulfidation is an emerging zvi modification method sulfidation refers to the introduction of sulfur into zvi and the added sulfur reacts with fe0 or fe ii in zvi to form another solid phase ferrous sulfides fesx fan et al 2017 the newly generated fesx can be attached to the surface of zvi or iron oxyhydr oxide layer of zvi mixed in zvi or can partially replace the original zvi the sulfidation of zvi facilitates the electron transfer from fe0 to zvi surface gu et al 2017 kim et al 2011 li et al 2018 which greatly improves the reactivity of this material in degrading some of the chlorinated hydrocarbons rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 it also improves the selectivity of electron transfer to target pollutants he et al 2018 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 and reduces the side reaction of hydrogen evolution from zvi by reacting with water fan et al 2016 he et al 2020a xu et al 2020 which means that sulfidation can improve the long term effect of zvi and reduce processing costs the method of sulfidating zvi mainly uses sulfur containing chemical reagents such as sulfide dithionite or thiosulfate etc cai et al 2021 fan et al 2017 to prepare sulfidated nanoscale zero valent iron s nzvi however because the synthesis of s nzvi is carried out in the water phase part of the fe0 is consumed by the hydrogen evolution reaction with water in addition to that is consumed by sulfidation agents themselves e g dithionite in addition as sulfidation occurs in the dissolved phase particle generation may be accompanied by the generation of toxic gasses such as h2s as well as salty wastewater chemical sulfidation methods also often require expensive and dangerous borohydride as a reducing agent these shortcomings complicate large scale production and application of s nzvi to overcome these shortcomings our group have recently prepared s mzvibm through adding microscale zvi mzvi and sulfur powder into a jar and milled by a planetary ball mill gu et al 2017 this preparation enhanced the activity of mzvi to degrade trichloroethylene and does not use toxic and harmful raw materials sulfidated zvi has been widely studied to remove heavy metals from the aqueous phase due to its outstanding performance in pollutant removal fan et al 2013 2019 huang et al 2018 li et al 2018 su et al 2015 wu et al 2018 zou et al 2019 at present there are few studies on how sulfidation affects the performance and mechanism of arsenic removal by zvi limited literature on the removal of as iii by s nzvi under oxic conditions indicates that there is a clear improvement in arsenic removal performance compared with single component zvi or fes wu et al 2018 however the mechanisms responsible for these observations have not been fully explored for example is sulfur enhanced electron transfer the key to enhanced removal of as if not what role does reduction play the interaction between sulfidated zvi and arsenic under different sulfidation conditions s fe molar ratios is possibly the key to identify the mechanisms of arsenic removal by sulfidated zvi in addition the removal of aqueous as is often desired to be performed in different redox environments for example oxic reaction systems often exist in the process of arsenic wastewater treatment anoxic systems often exist in deep groundwater environments and the interface between oxic and anoxic conditions exists widely in shallow groundwater environments winograd and robertson 1982 yuan et al 2018 however differences in the performance and mechanisms of as removal by sulfidated zvi under anoxic and oxic conditions have not been systematically investigated in this study we have examined the performance of s mzvibm materials with different s fe molar ratio to remove aqueous as iii under both anoxic and oxic conditions the reaction mechanisms between the materials and arsenic have been explored and quantified with the role of sulfur being made explicit a column setup was also established to evaluate the feasibility of efficient as iii removal from real groundwater by s mzvibm under ambient conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used were analytical grade or better further details of the chemicals are provided in the supporting information si ultrapure water was used for all solutions a stock solution of 500 mg l 1 as iii was prepared from naaso2 and preserved at 4 c all of the glassware used in experiments were soaked in 20 hno3 for more than 8 h then underwent ultrasonic cleaning for several minutes and rinsed with ultrapure water thrice before use all solutions used for anoxic experiments were deoxygenated before use by bubbling nitrogen gas for at least one hour then stored in a glovebox 2 2 particle preparation the s mzvibm particles were prepared using the method developed in our group gu et al 2017 briefly the grinding process was carried out in a planetary ball mill with stainless steel jars 100 ml and zirconia balls 6 mm in diameter different ratios of mzvi and elemental sulfur powder s fe 0 2 were mixed and sealed in stainless steel jars with an argon atmosphere the milling was performed at 400 rpm with ar headspace and at room temperature after up to 20 h of milling the s mzvibm particles were formed with the elemental s transformed to fes and collected in an n2 filled glovebag and stored in an argon filled glovebox before use 2 3 reaction systems batch experiments were conducted to determine as iii removal by s mzvibm in both anoxic and oxic environments the initial ph value of the suspensions was adjusted to ph 7 with 1 m hcl or naoh to simulate strict anoxic conditions s mzvibm 0 02 g and 100 ml of as iii solution were sequentially added into 125 ml serum bottles in the glovebox and then covered with aluminum caps containing ptfe butyl rubber septa the bottles were finally kept on a shaker table at 180 rpm and 25 5 c to simulate oxic conditions experiments were carried out with 200 ml as iii solution in 250 ml three necked flasks under 500 rpm continuous mechanical agitation at 25 5 c in the open air during the course of reaction an aliquot of 1 ml suspension was withdrawn at preset times and filtered by a 0 22 μm syringe filter before chemical analyses e g total and as v concentrations the residual solid phase after reaction was collected for characterization hydrogen gas generation under anoxic conditions was monitored by sampling and analyzing h2 in the reactor headspace at preset times for oxic conditions h2 production is difficult to be directly measured because of the open atmospheric environment therefore the following experimental approach was taken oxygenated as iii solution 100 ml was added to 125 ml serum bottles in open atmosphere and then the bottles were sealed with aluminum caps containing ptfe butyl rubber septa placed on a shaker table at 180 rpm and 25 5 c gas extraction from headspace was conducted by syringes at preset times for h2 measurements quenching experiments were carried out in the oxic experiments to determine which reactive oxidants are responsible for the oxidation of as iii to as v tert butyl alcohol tba 0 05 m superoxide dismutase sod 3 u ml 1 dimethylsulfoxide dmso 0 05 m and catalase cat 50 u ml 1 were used as the hydroxyl radical superoxide radical fe iv and hydrogen peroxide scavengers respectively anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 atalla et al 1985 pang et al 2011 2 4 arsenic sequential extraction method the method of as sequential extraction employed in this study was adopted from keon et al 2001 briefly five steps were used to differentiate the following operationally defined solid phase arsenic species ionically bound as or weakly adsorbed as strongly adsorbed as as coprecipitated with amorphous iron oxyhydr oxides as coprecipitated with crystalline iron oxyhydr oxides and as sulfides e g as2s3 as4s4 and feass table s1 the fractions of as associated with the above phases were recovered respectively by the following extractants mgcl2 nah2po4 ammonium oxalate oxalic acid ti iii citrate edta bicarbonate and hno3 detailed procedures of the sequential extraction methodology are listed in the si 2 5 analyses total aqueous as astotal concentrations were determined by atomic fluorescence spectrometry afs 230e and as iii v was measured by high performance liquid chromatography atomic fluorescence spectrometry hplc afs total aqueous iron concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy tas 990 and hydrogen was measured by gas chromatography gc 9790 with a tcd detector solid phase materials were collected and then dried in the glovebox after drying the materials were sealed in hermetic bottles and then packed in sealed bags in the glovebox in this way the bottles and bags were filled with argon which protects the samples from oxidation as much as possible during their shipping to characterization facilities the morphology of the material was derived from scanning electron microscope sem analyses x ray diffraction xrd was used to characterize crystalline phases at a scan rate of 0 1 s using cu kα radiation raman spectroscopy was conducted with a labram hr800 france and a 531 95 nm laser which was used for the analysis of iron oxyhydr oxides species that can t be completely distinguished by xrd the results from xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific usa 20 ev for high resolutions scans were fitted by the version 4 0 xpspeak software to determine the chemical oxidation state of as and fe more details regarding the fitting of xps spectra are provided in the si xanes at the as k edge was also used to investigate as speciation in the solid phases analyses in fluorescence mode were undertaken at room temperature in a 100 helium gas environment on the xas beamline of the australian synchrotron the athena software was used to perform linear combination fitting of the sample spectra to determine as speciation in solid phase with the use of the following standards as4s4 feass as 0 as iii and as v 2 6 column experiments the as iii removal studies were carried out in columns packed with a mixture of sand and s mzvibm the sand 40 60 mesh was purchased from donghai yuanyang quartz sand co jiangsu china and treated following the procedures of johnson et al 1996 before use the details are provided in the si the column used was 15 cm long with an internal diameter of 2 5 cm the first 1 cm at the bottom and 3 cm at the top of the columns were filled with sand as supports the middle part of the column was filled with a mixture of sand and iron materials of 70 g in which the s mzvibm had a weight percentage of 2 the influent was real groundwater collected from a drinking water well in hangzhou city with added as iii of 300 μg l 1 ph 7 6 0 5 the influent was continuously fed into the column in open air do concentration 7 9 mg l and in a bottom to top mode at a rate of 21 3 ml min by a peristaltic pump the corresponding empty bed contact time ebct was 2 54 min the effluent samples were collected at a preset time and analyzed for as concentration to determine the removal efficiency 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle characterization according to our previous study gu et al 2017 adding elemental sulfur during mzvi ball milling can not only form relatively homogeneous fe fes composite through solid solid reaction fe0 s0 fes but also accelerate the erosion of the particles to form smaller particles the addition of small amount of elemental s s fe 0 01 reduced the particle size from 38 0 to 6 3 μm after 20 h milling while the ball milled mzvi i e mzvibm without s0 as a control sample had a particle size of 12 3 μm the bet surface area of the formed s mzvibm was 1 5 m2 g while that of mzvibm was 0 21 m2 g interestingly further increase of s fe molar ratio did not cause further reduction of particle size figure s1 or increase of bet surface area this suggests that the following variation of as iii removal by s mzvibm with different s fe is likely not a consequence of particle size or surface area difference 3 2 kinetics of as iii removal by s mzvibm as iii removal by s mzvibm with different s fe molar ratios was studied and the results are shown in fig 1 s mzvibm removed as iii more efficiently under oxic conditions than under anoxic conditions oxygen plays an important role in the as iii removal by s mzvibm to further analyze the effect of s fe molar ratios on as iii removal under both anoxic and oxic conditions pseudo first order solid line and pseudo second order kinetics dotted line were applied to fit as iii removal kinetics the pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations are provided in the si it can be concluded from the coefficient of determination r2 that both pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic equations provide good fit of the as iii removal kinetics r2 0 94 by s mzvibm under anoxic conditions fig 1a table s2 quasi equilibrium short term as iii removal capacities qe were estimated from the fitting and the results are shown in figure s2a the removal of as iii by mzvibm i e s fe 0 was negligible an increase of s fe molar ratio from 0 to 0 05 resulted in the increase of both as iii removal capability 50 mg g 1 and rate although the incorporation of s resulted in 7 fold increase of particle surface area it cannot explain this level of as iii removal capacity increase and the newly formed fesx phase must contribute to the enhanced as iii removal by s mzvibm however when the s fe molar ratio was increased to 0 1 the as iii removal capability and rate remained stable and actually decreased when the s fe molar ratio was further increased to 0 2 nonetheless compared with mzvibm as iii removal capability was higher at all s fe molar ratios fig 1a the decreased as iii removal by s mzvibm at increased s fe molar ratio after 0 1 is presumably caused by the increased hydrophobicity of the particles as fes is more hydrophobic than iron oxyhydr oxides gu et al 2019 kim et al 2011 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 xu et al 2019 which may reduce the interaction of hydrophilic as iii oxyanion with s mzvibm the increased hydrophobicity of s zvi was also deemed to be the key reason for the reduced nitrate reduction by s zvi compared to its corresponding zvi gong et al 2021 pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics were also used to fit as iii removal kinetics under oxic conditions fig 1b since the as iii removal by mzvibm in 24 h is slower than s mzvibm and exhibits an almost linear curve longer term 72 h sorption experiments were performed to approach quasi equilibrium fig 1b inset the r2 for the pseudo first order kinetic model was the highest for mzvibm in this case table s2 first order kinetics have previously been used to fit as iii and as v removal by zero valent iron under oxic conditions su and puls 2001 sun et al 2014 however the pseudo second order kinetic model provided better fits to the as iii uptake data for s mzvibm regardless of the s fe molar ratio table s2 which suggests that there may be different reaction mechanisms occurring when sulfur is present it is interesting that the observed quasi equilibrium short term as iii removal capacity decreased from 350 to 170 mg g 1 as the s fe molar ratio increased from 0 to 0 2 figure s2b which is completely different to that observed under anoxic conditions and indicates different as iii removal mechanisms under oxic and anoxic conditions 3 3 characterization of reaction products it can be seen in the sem image of figure s3a that the surface of pristine s mzvibm was relatively smooth after reactions under both anoxic and oxic conditions the surface of the particles became coated with reaction products figure s3a figure s3a also shows that the size of the reacted particles under oxic conditions is much larger than that reacted with as iii under anoxic conditions maybe due to the corrosion product aggregation the xrd patterns of the pristine s mzvibm and reaction products under both anoxic and oxic conditions are shown in figure s3b iron oxyhydr oxides fes fes2 and fe0 were all detected in both reaction products compared to the pristine s mzvibm the magnitude of the iron oxyhydr oxide peak was similar after reaction with as iii under anoxic conditions a broad diffraction peak at 21 2θ appeared after reaction with as iii under oxic conditions this peak was attributed to amorphous or nano crystalline iron oxyhydr oxides kanel et al 2006 raman spectroscopy was further used to determine these species of iron oxyhydr oxides figure s3c the raman bands for hematite α fe2o3 219 283 1294 cm 1 akaganeite β feooh 396 cm 1 goethite α feooh 488 cm 1 and feo 598 cm 1 all exist in the spectra of both pristine and reacted s mzvibm particles the raman results suggest that there is no significant change in the species of iron oxyhydr oxides before and after reaction but the raman signal of the materials reacted under anoxic conditions is weaker than those reacted under oxic conditions and also the pristine s mzvibm based on sem xrd and raman spectroscopy data surficial iron oxyhydr oxides were consumed possibly due to chemical dissolution caused by zvi self reduction under anoxic conditions while large quantities of iron oxyhydr oxides were produced under oxic conditions the different structure change is determined by the corrosion of the material which is an electrochemical process talbot and talbot 2018 under oxic conditions oxygen serves as an important electron acceptor to accelerate iron corrosion the chemical forms of as and fe on the surface of the reacted s mzvibm particles were investigated by xps figures s4 and s5 in order to identify the speciation of as under either anoxic or oxic conditions etching depths of 0 to 50 nm were examined the xps as 3d measurements fig 2 a demonstrated that feass and or as 0 both have similar binding energies schaufuss et al 2000 yan et al 2010 as iii o as v o and as2s3 as4s4 were present after s mzvibm was reacted with as iii under anoxic conditions indicating the occurrence of adsorption oxidation reduction and asxsy precipitation the presence of as v 6 under anoxic conditions is possibly caused by as iii oxidation to as v by certain iron oxides formed from fe corrosion manning et al 2002 ramos et al 2009 of these processes adsorption of as iii appeared to be the dominant as iii sequestration process on the particle surface due to the presence of 60 as iii o species as can be seen from the as xps results as a function of etching depth figure s4 table s3 the proportion of asxsy under anoxic conditions decreased from 30 0 at the surface to 5 6 at a 50 nm etching depth in contrast the proportion of as 0 feass increased from 11 1 to 28 7 under oxic conditions as in the iii and v oxidation states made up the largest proportion of as species no as2s3 as4s4 peak was detected under oxic conditions and the as 0 feass peak was also weak at deeper etching depths with its percent contribution to as speciation ranging from 0 to 10 at a depth of 50 nm table s3 these results demonstrate that the proportion of as 0 feass increases with etching depth furthermore the reacted material shell consisted of mixed fe 0 fe ii fe iii phases under anoxic and oxic conditions based on the xps data figure s5 table s4 resulting in a mineral phase distribution of increased fe 0 and fe ii but decreased fe iii content from outside to inside of the particle fig 2b 3 4 as reduction and oxidation mechanisms as iii reduction was observed under both anoxic and oxic conditions based on the xps analyses fig 2a under anoxic conditions reduction played a greater role in as iii removal than under oxic conditions in a zvi h2o system the main reducing agents could include fe 0 fe ii s and atomic hydrogen h s jiao et al 2009 mondal et al 2014 among them h s was considered to have an insignificant role in as iii reduction mondal et al 2014 in our experimental system the relative proportion of fe 0 and fe ii increased with etching depth fig 2b which was correlated with the increased proportion of reduced arsenic species as 0 feas 1 s fig 2a this phenomenon suggests that as iii reduction is associated with the presence of fe 0 and or fe ii fes oxygenation can lead to the formation of h2s or hs which has been reported to be responsible for the reduction of as v to as iii in the fes as v system niazi and burton 2016 in our experiment no solution s species were detected through icp oes and no s0 was observed through xps therefore although the role of s ii as a reductant of as iii cannot be completely ignored gallegos et al 2008 2007 it does not appear to be significant under these conditions as v was mainly detected by xps in samples reacted under oxic conditions this oxidation state was also detected in solution fig 3 a oxidants leading to arsenic oxidation under oxic conditions could include hydrogen peroxide hydroxyl radical fe iv superoxide radical liu et al 2015 pang et al 2011 and possibly sulfur radical species he et al 2020b hydrogen peroxide is generated in two major ways the first is the two electron reduction process in which o2 is reduced to h2o2 directly eq 1 and the other is a one electron reduction in which o2 obtains an electron and generates a superoxide radical eq 2 which can react with divalent iron to generate hydrogen peroxide su et al 2018 eq 3 hydroxyl radicals are mainly derived from the fenton reaction between hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron keenan and sedlak 2008 pang et al 2011 su et al 2018 eq 4 another fenton oxidant could be fe iv pang et al 2011 eq 5 in order to explore the importance of these potential oxidants tba hydroxyl radical quencher sod superoxide radical quencher dmso fe iv quencher and cat hydrogen peroxide quencher were added to identify which of these oxidants mainly influence as iii oxidation as can be seen from the change of as iii astotal ratio in solution with the dose of different scavengers in fig 3 the addition of tba sod or dmso up to 0 4 m had almost no effect on the as iii astotal ratio this implies hydroxyl radical superoxide radical and fe iv may not be the major cause of as iii oxidation despite a small amount of hydroxyl radicals being detected during the reaction figure s6 the cumulative production of hydroxyl radicals in 5 h was only 4 μm which is insignificant compared to the initial as iii concentration of 0 13 mm however when cat was added the aqueous as iii astotal ratio was obviously higher which suggests that arsenic may be predominantly oxidized by h2o2 as iii oxidation mechanisms have been shown to vary with ph in oxic zvi as iii systems katsoyiannis et al 2008 under acidic conditions the hydroxyl radical is mainly responsible for as iii oxidation due to the fenton reaction eq 4 hug and leupin 2003 katsoyiannis et al 2008 under neutral conditions it has been observed that as iii was mainly oxidized by fe iv ding et al 2018 shao et al 2016 nonetheless shao et al 2016 also reported that fe iii as iii complex can be oxidized to fe iii as v complex by h2o2 in oxic fes as iii systems however hydroxyl radicals have been found to considerably contribute to the oxidation of as iii cheng et al 2016 since our experiments were performed under neutral ph and both hydroxyl radical and fe iv were not identified as major oxidants for as iii we hypothesize that the generation of as v in our case was mainly through the pathway of fe iii as iii oxidation by h2o2 our results also suggest that the oxidation of as iii in oxygenated s mzvibm system was mediated more by the presence of mzvi rather than iron sulfides 1 fe 0 o 2 2 h f e 2 h 2 o 2 2 f e 2 o 2 f e 3 o 2 3 f e 2 o 2 2 h f e 3 h 2 o 2 4 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 oh 2 o h 5 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iv h 2 o 3 5 interaction between arsenic and s mzvibm sequential extractions were performed to quantify the operationally defined solid phase associations of arsenic with s mzvibm s fe 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 2 under anoxic and oxic conditions and the results are presented in fig 4 a these results show that ionically bound as strongly adsorbed as as coprecipitated with iron oxyhydr oxides and as sulfides e g as2s3 as4s4 and feass were found to exist under anoxic conditions in contrast no as sulfides were measured under oxic conditions the formation of as sulfides appears to have been the dominant as iii removal process under anoxic conditions and accounts for approximately 60 80 of total arsenic removed as measured by the sequential extractions this contrasts with the xps results in which more than 60 of the arsenic was found in the form of as iii o bonding fig 2a together these results suggest that arsenite is an important species near the surface of s mzvibm but the bulk speciation is dominated by asxsy or as 0 feass in contrast the major fraction of arsenic removed under oxic conditions was through adsorption and accounted for essentially 100 of the total arsenic removed the results obviously reveal different removal mechanisms between anoxic and oxic conditions there was also a tendency for the removal mechanisms to vary based on the s fe molar ratios of s mzvibm under anoxic conditions with an increase in the s fe molar ratio the proportion of asxsy and as 0 feass initially increased to a maximum at a s fe molar ratio of 0 1 fig 4a and then decreased thereafter interestingly this pattern reflected that of as iii removal capability fig 1a the proportion of asxsy and as 0 feass and adsorbed as iii and as v cannot be distinguished by the sequential extraction results as a result further xanes spectroscopic results were obtained for the reacted materials under anoxic and oxic conditions fig 4b and the fractions of arsenic species formed are summarized in fig 4c an evident peak at 11 869 ev can be observed in the xanes spectra in samples collected under anoxic conditions and could be representative of as4s4 as 0 or feass the inclusion of all three minerals in lcf of the sample data fig 4b and table s5 indicated that as4s4 and feass were the most likely candidates contributing to this peak with a contribution from as 0 if present being less than 4 3 table s6 the distribution of arsenic species after 5 days of reaction with different s fe molar ratio s mzvibm particles in anoxic conditions is shown in fig 4c a small amount of as v can be detected in the xanes spectra which is consistent with the xps results arsenic removal as as iii and as v species decreased with an increase in the molar ratio of s fe demonstrating that the formation of as4s4 became a more important process however when the molar ratio of s fe 0 2 as4s4 decreased to 7 4 mg g 1 and no feass was observed figure s7 indicating that the s mzvibm might have been passivated under oxic conditions however only as iii and as v were detected with an increase in s fe molar ratio the percentage of solid phase as as as iii increased from 39 to 60 and the percentage of as v decreased accordingly table s5 the decrease in the proportion of as v with an increase in the s fe molar ratio demonstrates that the production of oxidizing agents decreased or their ability to oxidize as iii was impaired in some way from our experiments described earlier an important oxidant is likely to be hydrogen peroxide which is produced from the oxidation of zero valent iron eq 1 and fe ii eq 3 a decreasing proportion of as v resulting with an increase in the s fe molar ratio of s mzvibm reveals that the concentration of fe0 used to produce hydrogen peroxide decreased it is noteworthy that the arsenic speciation results derived from the xanes analyses and sequential chemical extraction data are consistent figs 4a and 4c this suggests that the obtained as speciation information for the reacted particles from both analyses are representative 3 6 as iii removal pathway under anoxic and oxic conditions s mzvibm has shown favorable properties for removing as iii from the aqueous phase under both anoxic and oxic conditions and the main difference between them is the utilization of s mzvibm and the removal mode of as iii a conceptual model of the reaction between as iii and s mzvibm under anoxic and oxic conditions is shown in fig 5 as iii removal mechanisms under anoxic and oxic conditions include adsorption coprecipitation with iron oxyhydr oxides kanel et al 2005 oxidation reduction sun et al 2011 and as4s4 feass production bostick and fendorf 2003 kim and batchelor 2009 the formation of as4s4 is the dominant pathway leading to arsenic removal under anoxic conditions while adsorption is the main mechanism under oxic conditions under anoxic conditions both as iii reduction and h2 evolution occurred figure s8 however no hydrogen production was observed under oxic conditions i e electrons from zvi are mainly consumed by oxygen eq 1 6 which produces h2o2 for as iii oxidation 6 2 fe 0 2 h 2 o o 2 2 f e 2 4 o h with a change in s mzvibm s fe molar ratios as iii removal capabilities differed between anoxic and oxic conditions this is most likely due to the different removal mechanisms occurring under the different oxygen conditions in the absence of oxygen arsenic is removed mainly through reduction and the precipitation of as4s4 an initial increase in the s fe molar ratio resulted in an increase in arsenic removal however when the s fe molar ratio was equal to 0 2 the reaction between fes and as was prevented the mechanism behind this passivating effect at high s fe is unclear but merits further investigation under oxic conditions adsorption was the most important as iii removal process and a decrease of fe in the particles i e with an increase in the s fe molar ratio resulted in the reduced formation of iron oxyhydr oxides resulting in decreased as iii removal capability 3 7 as removal from real groundwater in column setup s mzvibm has exhibited excellent as iii removal kinetics and capacity in batch experiments under oxic conditions to evaluate the engineering application of s mzvibm in as iii removal from contaminated groundwater column sorption experiments were carried out under ambient conditions and the effluent histories are recorded fig 6 ball milled mzvi i e s fe 0 was also used as a comparison fig 6 illustrates that s mzvibm s fe 0 1 was highly efficient in removing as iii from real groundwater allowing the rapid reduction of the as concentration from 300 μg l 1 to below 10 μg l 1 the drinking water standard in china up to 750 bed volumes with a ebct of 2 54 min the corresponding as removal capacity was 12 2 mg g 1 for s mzvibm which is higher than most of the reported as iii removal capacity in column setup e g 0 95 mg g for nzvi pumice zeolite ranjan et al 2020 2 3 mg g for iron hydroxide granulates daus et al 2004 in comparison the removal of as iii by mzvibm under the same operational conditions was unsatisfactory the initial effluent concentration was high as 130 μg l 1 and it continued to increase after 400 bed volumes the material cost for treating 1 ton as iii wastewater 300 μg l by s mzvibm s fe 0 1 is estimated to be 0 037 if the material cost and as iii removal capacity are assumed to be 1500 ton and 12 2 mg g 1 respectively the favorable column experiment results along with the low treatment cost suggest that s mzvibm is one of the most promising and cost effective materials in capturing as iii from groundwater and ensure drinking water safety for people even from developing countries 4 conclusion this study applied the use of a ball mill to prepare s mzvibm that possesses good properties for as iii remediation under anoxic and oxic conditions arsenic removal is more efficient in the presence of oxygen therefore this material is best suited for the remediation of oxygenated groundwaters column experiments further confirmed that s mzvibm was able to rapidly reduce as iii concentration in a real groundwater from 300 ug l to drinking water standard for up to 750 bed volumes the material cost for treating 1 ton water using s mzvibm was estimated to be as low as 0 037 therefore this material is very promising in addressing
