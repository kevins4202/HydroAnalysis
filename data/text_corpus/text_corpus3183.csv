15915,the widespread distribution of persistent organic pollutants pops in natural waters has aroused global concern due to their potential threat to the aquatic environment photocatalysis represents a promising mean to remediate polluted waters with the simple assistance of solar energy herein we fabricated a co cl bond reinforced coal ldh bi12o17cl2 heterogeneous photocatalyst to investigate the feasibility of photocatalysis to treat pops polluted water under environmental conditions the optimum coal ldh bi12o17cl2 5 lb composite photocatalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance which could degrade 92 47 of ciprofloxacin cip and 95 of bisphenol a bpa with 2h of actual solar light irradiation in changsha china n 28 12 e 112 59 in view of the synergistic influence of water constituents various water matrices greatly affected the degradation rate of cip bpa with the degradation efficiency of 82 17 84 37 in tap water 69 67 71 63 in wastewater effluent and 44 07 67 7 in wastewater inflow the results of electron spin resonance and chemical trapping experiment hplc ms and density functional theory calculation reflected that the degradation of cip was mainly attributed to h and 1o2 attacking the active atoms of cip molecule with high fukui index furthermore the non toxicity of both 5 lb photocatalyst and treated cip solution was proved by e coli and b subtilis cultivation which further demonstrated the feasibility of the 5 lb to treat pops in real water under irradiation of solar light graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words photocatalysis bi12o17cl2 coal ldh ciprofloxacin degradation actual sunlight toxicity assessment 1 introduction persistent organic pollutants pops e g pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupters with high toxicity carcinogenicity and bioaccumulation in the aquatic ecosystem are both tedious and expensive to treat dong et al 2015a towards the treatment of pops in water and wastewater many advanced technologies with high efficiency and low cost have been developed to date including adsorption microbial degradation electrolysis and photocatalysis dong et al 2015a pi et al 2018 among these methods environmentally friendly photocatalysis is superior in terms of its outstanding ability on complete destroying the contaminates with the simple aid of solar energy sun et al 2020 yang et al 2022 in practical application ideal photocatalysts are required to achieve excellent solar light absorption and fast conversion dong et al 2015b wu et al 2018 two dimensional 2d layered materials demonstrate unique ability of confinement of electrons in their layer leading to exceptional optical and electronic properties xiong et al 2018 besides the strong in plane covalent bonding furnishes sites for the construction of heterostructures the resulting 2d 2d heterojunction with greater contact area possesses plentiful tight and high speed charge transfer channels at interfacial junction for convenient migration of charge ganguly et al 2019 bismuth oxyhalide is one of a new class of 2d layered materials for photocatalytic energy conversion and environment remediation specially the bismuth rich ones such as bi12o17cl2 guo et al 2021 and bi24o31br10 shang et al 2014 have been confirmed to possess higher photon absorption efficiency and more negative conduction band positions that can meet most of the reaction potential it is worth noting that the yellow bi12o17cl2 illustrate outstanding visible light photocatalytic performance for pollutant degradation whereas the fast recombination of photogenerated charges still hindered the further application of bi12o17cl2 li et al reported that the internal electric field between bi12o17 and cl2 can actuate the transfer of electrons from bi12o17cl2 to other semiconductors li et al 2016 furthermore the interlaminar cl can form chemical bonding with foreign cations which further favors the heterogenous migration of carriers zhu et al 2021 therefore we hypothesized that the construction of a heterostructure between bi12o17cl2 and another 2d semiconductor with a matching band structure will be a promising way to enhance the separation efficiency of photoexcited carriers meanwhile acquire improved photocatalytic performance of bi12o17cl2 layered double hydroxides ldhs m1 x 2 mx 3 oh 2 an x n mh2o also known as hydrotalcite like clays are another kind of 2d laminated materials which possess the merits of low cost facile preparation large surface area flexible interlayer structure for electron transfer visible light response performance and abundant active sites tang et al 2016 in recent years ldhs are highlighted for their capacity to enhance catalytic activity in cooperation with other functional materials lee et al reported that the coal ldhs with the band gap of 2 1 ev can serve as the visible light absorber to hybridize with p25 kumar et al 2017 wu et al clarified that the unoccupied d orbitals of co or al atoms of coal ldh can couple with the n atoms of g c3n4 to form covalent bonding states thereby promoting the separation and transfer of photoexcited charges wu et al 2018 thus it is expected to improve the photochemical properties of bi12o17cl2 by coupling with coal ldh in this study we firstly fabricated the eco friendly coal ldh bi12o17cl2 x lb photocatalysts via a facile hydrothermal method and the performance of lb hybrids for pops removal was evaluated by their degradation ability for ciprofloxacin cip and bisphenol a bpa under simulate visible light meanwhile the radical trapping experiments esr measure hplc ms and density functional theory dft calculation were conducted to deduce the photocatalytic pathway and mechanism then the influence of the water characteristics e g ph anions natural dissolved organic matter and microplastics on photocatalytic performance was investigated to evaluate the potential application of x lb in a real environment on this basis degradation of pops in different natural water matrices under the irradiation of natural solar light was also carried out to verify the practical feasibility last but not least the toxicity of the treated pops solution and the leaching solution of x lb was assessed by toxic effects on typical bacteria the potential for eliminating the threat of pops in natural environmental conditions without causing secondary pollution via bismuth oxyhalides based photocatalyst was verified in this study 2 experimental section 2 1 synthesis of coal ldh bi12o17cl2 all used chemicals were listed in text s1 and were used as received the coal ldh bi12o17cl2 hybrids were synthesized by an in situ method and the detailed process was described in text s2 2 2 photocatalytic activity measurement to

containing 400 mg l 1 5 lb when investigating the effects of real water matrices and natural sunlight on the photocatalytic performance of 5 lb experimental solutions were obtained by adding cip or bpa powder to 0 45 μm membrane filtered tap water changsha china wastewater inflow changsha china and wastewater effluent changsha china and the photocatalysis experiments were carried out from 13 00 p m to 15 00 p m on sunny days in september 2021 in changsha china n 28 12 e 112 59 light intensity was 30 35 mw cm 2 measured by the pl mw 2000 light power meter from beijing perfectlight technology co ltd china 2 3 biotoxicity assessment typical gram negative bacteria escherichia coli e coli and gram positive bacteria bacillus subtilis b subtilis were selected as biological subsequent models to evaluated the toxicity and the detailed information was presented in text s5 2 4 theoretical calculation method the fukui index of cip was calculated by gaussian 16w program and the calculation details were described in supporting information text s6 lu and chen 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 crystalline chemical and morphology structures the crystalline structures of the as prepared samples were analyzed by xrd fig 1 a the boc patterns exhibited a series of strong diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 23 2 24 3 26 4 29 2 30 4 32 9 45 5 47 2 54 9 56 5 corresponding respectively to the 111 113 115 117 0012 200 2012 220 315 and 317 lattice planes of the standard tetragonal bi12o17cl2 jcpds 37 0702 for the pure ldh the peaks at 11 7 23 5 and 34 6 can be assigned to 003 006 and 009 lattice planes of a stacked ldh phase with co3 2 in the interlayer region dou et al 2015 x lb hybrids demonstrated a similar xrd patterns of boc indicating the integration of these two semiconductors with high purity and degree of crystallinity the peaks of ldh were inconspicuous due to its low contents and only when the content of ldh reached 3 wt the peaks at 23 5 and 34 6 of ldh can be observed collectively the two semiconductors were well combined and the introduction of ldh did not affect the phase of boc for further determine the surface elemental compositions and valence states of the as prepared photocatalysts and provide a better understanding of the interaction between boc and ldh x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis was introduced based on the xps survey spectra fig 1b the presence of co element in 5 lb further confirmed the successful fabrication of the composite furthermore the high resolution xps spectra of bi 4f cl 2p co 2p and o 1s were revealed in fig 1c f as shown in the high resolution spectra of bi 4f the binding energy for bi 4f 5 2 and 4f 7 2 of boc were 164 3 and 159 0 ev the peak positions did not alter after the introduction of ldh indicating that ldh exhibited negligible effect on the original structure of bi12o17 slab whereas the characteristic peak at 199 6 and 197 9 ev corresponding to cl 2p1 2 and cl 2p3 2 of cl ions upshifted to a higher energy level 199 8 and 198 2 ev after the modification of ldh the shifts of binding energy verified that coupling interaction occurred between boc and ldh which affected the electronic energy distribution of boc simultaneously the position of co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 characteristic peaks in 5 lb composites downshifted from 781 6 and 797 7 ev to 781 2 and 797 4 ev respectively wang et al 2017 which indicated that the electrons of cl atoms as electron donor can interact with the unoccupied d orbitals of co atoms to form co cl bond with the minimal space constraints liu et al 2019 wu et al 2018 this was further confirmed by the high resolution xps spectra of o 1s fig 1f the o 1s peak of ldh at 531 6 and 532 9 ev corresponded respectively to the co o and al o species in ldh and the peaks of boc at 529 7 531 0 and 532 8 ev were ascribed to lattice bi o bi bond surface hydroxyl and adsorbed h2o respectively guo et al 2021 wang et al 2017 interestingly the binding energies of lattice co o species for 5 lb were 531 5 ev and the conversion trend of the binding energy value of co o is in keeping with that of co 2p however the peaks for bi o bi bond surface hydroxyl and adsorbed h2o on 5 lb maintained unchanged demonstrating that ldh did not connect to boc via o containing chemical bonds thus all the results above clarified that the formation of intimate heterostructure between ldh and boc was attribute to the formation of co cl bond at the interface and co atoms on the heterojunction possess lower binding energy compared to pristine ldh may be ascribed to the acquisition of electrons in the heterogeneous system resulting the increase of electron density wang et al 2020 reversely the electrons escape of cl atoms leads to the decrease of electron density reflecting as higher binding energy the sem images of pure ldh boc and 5 lb were exhibited in fig 2 clearly the fabricated ldh crystal nanosheets were of hexagonal shapes the pure boc exhibited irregular and compactly agglomerated two dimensional structure after dispersing the ldh nanosheets into aqueous solution via ultrasonication under the solvothermal condition ldh sheets acted as a substrate to induce the in situ growth of boc in a plane to plane manner as shown in fig 2c and d a large amount of boc sheets dispersed on the surface of ldh substrate which facilitated the dispersal of boc furthermore edx element mapping was carried out on the area shown by fig 2d which demonstrated that bi cl co o were distributed throughout the 5 lb samples fig 2e h additionally the bright hexagonal region of co element further indicated that the hexagonal nanosheet in fig 2d could be ascribed to ldh the tem images further confirmed the microstructure of the hexagonal ldh sheets fig s1a and the 2d structure of the pure boc fig s1b as for 5 lb hybrids fig s1c both hexagonal ldh sheets and 2d boc could be observed meanwhile two types of contrast fringes in the hrtem image of 5 lb hybrids fig s1d was found the lattice spacing of 0 259 nm was correspond to the 012 plane of the ldh phase and the lattice fringes of 0 338 nm were ascribed to the 115 plane of the boc phase the surface area and porosity of the photocatalysts play a significant role in their photocatalytic performance as displayed in the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig s2a the typical iv isotherm with an h3 hysteresis loop existed in all samples which confirmed the presence of mesoporous structure the specific surface area pore volume and average pore size were shown in table s1 and fig s2b obviously boc possessed a small specific surface area 4 391 m2g 1 and poor mesoporous feature which may limit the photocatalytic activity while ldh possessed the relatively larger specific surface area 38 975 m2g 1 fortunately the addition of 5 wt ldh increased the specific surface area of boc to 2 2 times 9 666 m2g 1 and the mesoporous features became more obvious which may promote the exposure of the active sites and the diffusion of contaminants and active radicals during the photocatalytic process 3 2 photocatalytic performance herein cip molecules have been adopted to assess the capability for eliminating pops of the as prepared x lb composites with different content of ldh fig 3 a depicted the changes of the cip concentration over time dark and irradiation time in the presence of the as synthesized photocatalysts after 120 min dark reaction and 120 min visible light irradiation λ 420 nm approximately 7 19 and 62 76 of cip was removed over bare ldh and bare boc respectively besides it was obvious that coupling ldh with boc could effectively improve the removal efficiency of cip and the optimal removal effect appeared in 5 lb where 96 37 of cip was removed from the solution it was worth noting that x lb composites had stronger adsorption capacity than pure boc in order to eliminate the influence of adsorption on the experimental data in the light stage we firstly conducted the adsorption tests of above photocatalysts for cip under the dark condition as illustrated in fig 3b ldh boc and 5 lb reached adsorption equilibrium at about 120 min implying that the adsorption process wouldn t further interfere with the subsequent analysis of photocatalytic results furthermore the adsorption kinetics results were fitted with pseudo first order model solid lines in fig 3b and pseudo second order model dashed lines in fig 3b respectively and the fitted parameters were listed in table s2 pseudo second order kinetics process was more suitable for the adsorption process of ldh r2 0 99252 and boc r2 0 9994 which reflected that the chemical adsorption was the rating limiting step in the adsorption process of ldh and boc yu et al 2021 for 5 lb the pseudo first order model r2 0 99968 was more suitable meanwhile pseudo second order model r2 0 99162 also exhibited high degree of fit this result indicating that the adsorption process of 5 lb was more inclined to physisorption interaction although chemisorption also played an important role tang et al 2018 afterwards adsorption isotherm models analysis interpreted fig s3 that the langmuir isotherm model showed better correlation than freundlich isotherm model for ldh boc and 5 lb which indicated that the monolayer adsorption is the main adsorption process of above materials toward cip perez marin et al 2007 subsequently the photocatalytic performance of the as prepared photocatalysts could be investigated fig 3c showed that there was no reduction in the concentration of cip in the presence of a pure ldh after 120 min of visible light irradiation and boc exhibited relatively higher activity with the degradation efficiency of 57 12 whereas all the x lb hybrids displayed higher photocatalytic degradation activity this indicated that the synergistic effect between ldh and boc played a significant role in the photocatalytic process although ldh exhibited a poor cip degradation performance furthermore the coupling content of ldh highly affected the degradation effect of cip specifically the photocatalytic degradation efficiency increased gradually with the rise of ldh content from 1 wt to 5 wt and 5 lb exhibited the optimum performance where 91 49 of cip was decomposed however further increasing the coupling content of ldh to 10 wt led to the attenuation of photocatalytic effect this phenomenon might be due to that the increased co2 or al3 contacted with boc more exposed heterojunction sites for charge transfer were built up but the quality and quantity of effective heterointerfaces favorable for charge transfer decreased which in turn reduced photocatalytic performance on the other hand wu et al 2018 thus the control over the ratio of ldh to boc was essential to achieve optimal photocatalytic performance meanwhile the degradation kinetics curves have been fitted according to the pseudo first model and the values of rate constants k were shown in fig 3d it was obvious that the cip degradation rate was the fastest for 5 lb 0 0214 min 1 besides the photocatalytic activity of 5 lb was further estimated toward the photodegradation of a typical endocrine disrupter bisphenol a bpa the photodegradation efficiency could reach 79 37 over 5 lb fig 3e giving a degradation rate of 0 0121 min 1 under visible light irradiation the degradation rate of 5 lb was almost 1 75 and 24 69 folds higher than that of pure boc and pure ldh fig 3f furthermore the stability of the 5 lb was investigated to ensure that this activity was reproducible over sequential treatment cycles as exhibited in fig s4 after three repeated treatments 5 lb still possessed an excellent removal capacity for cip and the cip degradation efficiency was 84 84 on the third cycling run slightly lower than that of the initial round 91 49 in brief these results reflected the potential advantages of 5 lb for ameliorating concerns with pops in real systems 3 3 optical and photoelectrochemical property in order to understand the reasons for the excellent photocatalytic performance the optical electrical properties of the photocatalysts have also been studied by uv vis spectrum uv vis drs and photoelectrochemical tests as illustrated in fig s5a pure boc exhibited a strong absorption from the ultraviolet to visible light range and its band gap absorption edge was around 580 nm bare ldh displayed two distinct absorption bands where the one that appeared in the uv range could be assigned to ligand to metal charge transfer o2 mn and the other broad band centered around 500 nm was attributable to d d transitions of octahedral co2 within the ldh layer kumar et al 2017 this typical light absorption of ldh in the visible range could also be observed in the 5 lb composite implying the strong interaction between boc and ldh in the resulting heterojunction notably compared with boc 5 lb exhibited a clear red shift in the absorption edge and an intensified light absorption in the visible region which makes this hybrid a promising material for solar light driven catalytic applications additionally the band gap of pure boc and ldh were estimated to be 2 13 and 2 1 ev respectively according to the tauc plot in fig s5b furthermore the mott schottky plots fig s5c d exhibited that both boc and ldh showed n type semiconductor properties huang et al 2017 and their vfb were identified to be 0 9 and 0 81 v vs sce respectively corresponding to the conduction band cb potentials of 0 76 and 0 67 v vs nhe respectively hence the valence band vb potentials were determined to be 1 37 and 1 43 v vs nhe via the formula eg evb ecb fig s5e clearly displayed that the photocurrent intensity of 5 lb was much higher than that of bare boc and ldh indicating the enhanced separation efficiency of photo induced electron hole pairs simultaneously fig s5f depicted that the 5 lb possessed the lowest charge migration resistance which confirmed that the formation of co cl bond between boc and ldh expedited the transfer of photo excited charges therefore it was reasonably induced that the boosted photochemical properties promoted the photocatalytic performance furthermore the photoluminescence pl analysis fig s6 showed that the emission peak of 5 lb hybrid was lower than that of pure ldh and pure boc which further confirmed that the recombination of photogenerated carriers were effectively suppressed because of the interfacial charge transfer between ldh and boc 3 4 role of reactive species in cip degradation chemical quenchers were applied to the experimental solutions to elucidate the contribution of specific reactive species to cip degradation fig 4 a showed the extents of cip degradation after 120 min of irradiation for the blank control and solutions containing ipa tempol na2c2o4 and nan3 were approximately 91 49 90 37 59 22 44 50 and 42 23 respectively furthermore the observed rate constants for cip degradation were 0 0214 0 01973 0 00694 0 00462 and 0 00416 min 1 respectively fig 4b using eqs 1 4 the relative contributions of oh o2 h and 1o2 to the overall cip degradation were calculated to be 7 8 67 6 78 4 and 72 8 respectively note that the contributions sum to more than 100 because the generation of 1o2 involved o2 and h eq 8 10 and eq 12 that is when o2 or h was quenched by a scavenger the effect of 1o2 was also inhibited wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 nevertheless h and 1o2 production by the 5 lb photocatalytic system were found to be the major mechanism of cip degradation the esr signals further verified the role of 1o2 and o2 during the photocatalytic process fig 4c e at the same irradiation point in time 10 min the signal intensity of tmpo 1o2 was much stronger than dmpo o2 and the signal intensity of dmpo oh was not obvious indicating that the 1o2 was the major reactive radical followed by o2 and the oh only played a minor role 3 5 degradation pathways of cip to elucidate the photocatalytic mechanisms associated with cip degradation transformation products were identified by samples collected at 0 60 and 120 min of irradiation for lc ms analysis the total ms spectra of possibly molecular intermediates at different reaction time were listed in figs s7 and s8 and 12 major transformation products were confirmed table s3 apparently the peak intensity of cip molecule m z 332 gradually decreased with the illumination time while the peak intensity of the substances with smaller m z values were first increase with irradiation time and then decrease upon further irradiation which means that cip was gradually degraded into small molecule products by 5 lb and further illumination mineralized these products furthermore the toc removal experiment fig s9 manifested that 5 lb can mineralize cip more efficiently and 66 3 of cip was mineralized into inorganic small molecules co2 and h2o etc after 2h illumination to better examine the mechanisms that produced the 12 identified transformation products during photocatalysis of cip the npa charge distribution and fukui index were used to predict the sites of reactive species attack the results of this analysis were summarized in fig 5 according to fukui function theory a high f value suggests that an atom is more like to be attacked by electrophilic reagent h 1o2 a high positive point charge indicates the likelihood of o2 attack nucleophilic reaction and a high f0 value indicates that an atom is likely to be attacked by and oh the 6n 2o 13c 23c 1f and 4o positions exhibited high f values suggesting the potential for h and 1o2 attack the 24c 19c 23c 12c 15c and 11c positions displayed high positive point charges and so these positions are expected to undergo preferential attack by o2 high f0 values were calculated for the 2o 6n 12c 22c 19c and 23c positions demonstrating that these sites may be directly attack by oh li et al 2021 these analyses were used with the identified transformation products to propose a tentative cip photocatalytic pathway for the 5 lb vis system fig 6 pathway i was mainly a defluorination and hydroxylation process which has been widely reported for degradation of fluoroquinolones lai et al 2019 wen et al 2018 specifically the transformation from cip to p1 was subjected to attacking at 1f f 0 0401 23c q 0 0829 f 0 0503 f0 0 0438 22c f0 0 0464 and 12c q 0 048 f0 0 052 which leads to the cleavage of the c f bond of cip and the addition of a hydroxyl then the quinolone ring was broken resulting in the formation of p2 in pathway ii it is detected that the intermediate product p3 was generated through the nucleophilic addition reaction which is consistent with the nucleophilic site calculated by dft this mechanisms align with previous reports of photocatalysis of cip antibiotics by tio2 hu et al 2020 pathway iii was the aldehyde reaction according to the fukui index 6n position is most vulnerable to active species in piperazine rings but it is difficult for 6n to accept radical addition due to saturation sites and steric hindrance meanwhile due to the strong electron withdrawing property of tertiary amine 6n the α carbon 17c in piperazine ring became the next most susceptible position to be attacked by surrounding active species zheng et al 2018 1o2 attacked the 17c in cip to form endoperoxide eq 5 which would further decompose to form acetaldehyde groups in a similar manner as that reported by li et al li et al 2021 liu et al 2021 wei et al 2015 the formed product p1 were prone to be attacked by h and subsequent hydrolysis to generated p2 and p2 isomers chen et al 2019 furthermore the aldehyde groups decomposed resulting in formation of the p4 and p6 ultimately the identified products from all four pathways were photodegraded into smaller oxygen containing compounds and then being mineralized into water and carbon dioxide 5 3 6 photocatalytic mechanism governing the 5 lb photocatalytic system on the basis of the above results and the energy levels of coal ldh and bi12o17cl2 the mechanism shown in fig 7 was proposed for 5 lb photocatalytic system the boc nanosheets were evenly immobilized on the surface of ldh in a plane to plane manner via co cl bond compared with pure boc nanosheets the ldh nanosheets as substrate material suppressed the agglomeration of boc thereby the relatively higher surface volume ratio made more adsorption sites of boc be exposed this allowed more pops molecules to be adsorbed onto the boc surface during the dark reaction stage which was conducive to further degradation under visible light illumination both ldh and boc could be activated into excited state and generated electrons and holes see eq 6 7 considering the stagger arrangement of band positions for boc and ldh the photoexcited electrons could thermodynamically transfer from the cb of boc to the cb of ldh whereas holes migrated oppositely in the vb due to the built in electric field at the interface therefore the photoexcited electrons and holes were effectively separated in micro space 6 ldh hv ldh h e 7 boc hv boc h e since the cb potential of ldh was more negative than the standard reduction potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev the conduction band e can be captured by dissolved oxygen to form o2 see eq 8 subsequently the o2 reacts with h eq 9 to produce 1o2 eq 10 and oh eq 11 chen et al 2019 meanwhile o2 can also be oxidized by h to form 1o2 eq 12 luo et al 2021 wang et al 2019 in addition the free radical trapping experiments show that the contribution of o2 is lower than that of 1o2 which means that the generation of 1o2 also experienced other pathways such as dissolved oxygen from water eq 13 liang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 the h gathered on the vb of boc with a potential of 1 37 ev is difficult to react with water or ho to form oh thus the oh in the 5 lb photocatalytic system was derived from o2 initiated reactions and the esr results showed that the generation of oh was limited this explained why oh the played a negligible role in the degradation of cip while the h and 1o2 dominated the cip transformation 8 e o2 o2 9 o2 h ho2 10 2ho2 h2o2 1o2 11 h2o2 e oh oh 12 o2 h 1o2 13 3o2 1o2 energy transfer 3 7 effects of water quality and interfering substances on cip photocatalysis the effect of ph value on the photocatalytic performance was shown in fig 8 a and fig s10a the observed rate constant for cip degradation increased from 0 00357 min 1 at ph 3 0 to 0 0181 min 1 at ph 9 0 then decreased to 0 0101 at ph 11 0 this change trend was related to the surface properties of the photocatalyst and the states of the cip molecules as known the cip molecule can form five molecular species including cip3 species ph 3 01 cip2 species 3 01 ph 6 14 cip species 6 14 ph 8 70 cip species 8 70 ph 10 58 and cip species ph 10 58 yu et al 2021 obviously the ph value of 10 58 is the watershed of the states of cip molecules meanwhile the different ph value leaded to the alterations in the zeta potentials of 5 lb and the results were shown in fig 8b when the ph was in the range of 3 9 the surface of 5 lb possessed positive charges with a downward trend thus the electrostatic repulsion with cip species was gradually diminished which favored the attachment of cip molecules to the photocatalytic active sites on the surface of 5 lb nevertheless the surface of 5 lb was negatively charged at ph value of 11 where cip molecules possessed the same electronegativity indicating that the repulsive force between 5 lb and the deprotonated cip was intensified and thereby led to an inferior cip degradation efficiency the results of adsorption experiments fig s10b almost agreed with the above conclusions the effects of water quality constituents on the performance for cip photocatalysis were shown in fig 8c among the studied anions the multivalent anions so4 2 co3 2 indicated a more adverse effect than monovalent anions cl and no3 on photocatalytic cip degradation this is probably due to the stronger adsorption of multivalent ions than monovalent ions on electropositive photocatalyst surface which consequently hindered the reaction of the cip molecules with the active site thus the amount of cip molecules attached to the surface of 5 lb was decreased the adsorption experiment well evidenced this phenomenon fig s10c it was obvious that the adsorption of cip molecules on 5 lb was severely inhibited by co3 2 while cl and no3 exerted little influence besides the co3 2 can hydrolyze to generate oh ions and hco3 ions leading to the enhancement of the ph value from 5 6 to 11 7 which is detrimental to photocatalytic activity fig 8a furthermore the different effects of the various ions can also attribute to the reaction kinetics between the active species and anions for example it is reported that co3 2 possess high ability of hole capture and the rate constant for co3 2 reaction with oh to be 3 7 108 m 1 s 1 david behar 1970 tan et al 2019 humic acid ha composed of aromatics and various functional groups is complex organic molecules produced by the decomposition of plant and animals and widely exists in natural water therefore it is necessary to understand the effect of ha on 5 lb photocatalytic activity as fig 8d exhibited the degradation efficiency of cip was significantly restrained by the ha and the inhibitory effect increased with the concentration of ha this may be due to the competitive interaction of ha with reactive species and light screening effects induced by the conjugated double bonds chromophoric structure of ha in the visible region fig 8 yang et al 2021 meanwhile ha with negative charges is easily adsorbed to the surface of 5 lb and block the active sites which impedes the adsorption of cip to the surface of 5 lb fig s10d thereby inhibiting the photodegradation of cip recently the ubiquitous microplastics in aquatic environment has attracted wide attention feng et al 2021 in this case polystyrene ps particles were added into the reaction system to evaluate the effect of microplastics on 5 lb photocatalytic system fig s10e interestingly relatively lower concentrations of ps 10 mg l 1 reduced the degradation rate of cip but had little effect on the final degradation effect however higher concentration of 20 mg l 1 inhibited the degradation efficiency obviously and only 80 18 of cip was degraded similarly the reduction of degradation efficiency could also be attributed to the contact restraint of cip with 5 lb fig s10f to better evaluate the suitability of the 5 lb to degrade pops under environmental conditions cip and bpa degradation were studied in different water matrices under the natural sunlight illumination the primary chemical properties of the real water matrices were shown in table s4 as indicated in fig 8f cip had a weak photolysis under natural sunlight while bpa hardly underwent photolysis under natural sunlight irradiation besides the observed degradation efficiency for cip in ultrapure water tap water wastewater effluent and wastewater inflow were 92 47 82 17 69 67 and 44 07 respectively and that of bpa were 95 84 37 71 63 and 67 70 respectively surprisingly the photocatalytic performance of 5 lb in ultrapure water under natural sunlight illumination was even slightly better than that of xenon lamp in view of the strong light intensity of xenon lamp we believe that the superior photocatalytic effect under natural sunlight may be caused by the unfiltered ultraviolet light and the thermal effect in order to verify this hypothesis we used an am 1 5g filter to provide simulated sunlight and the results and related analysis were shown in fig s11 ultrapure water exhibited the fastest cip and bpa degradation due to the absence of reactive species scavenging or light screening compared to ultrapure water the degradation of cip and bpa was inhibited in environmental waters especially in wastewater inflow due to the scavenging effects caused by organic toc 6 48 mg l 1 cod 85 8 mg l 1 and inorganic matters cl 23 1 mg l 1 so4 2 21 2 mg l 1 these results suggested that 5 lb sunlight photocatalytic system for ameliorating concerns with pops are most applicable in after stage of water treatment 3 8 toxicity assessment using e coli and b subtilis as indicators the toxicity effects of the 5 lb photocatalysts and cip as well as its photocatalytic degraded intermediates were assessed by their impacts on the surviving bacterial colonies density compared to that of the blank as exhibited in fig 9 a the introduction of 5 lb leaching solution did not significantly change the bacterial colonies density compared to the blank sample similarly the growth curves of e coli and b subtilis fig 9b further demonstrated the negligible effects of 5 lb on bacteria manifesting that 5 lb cannot cause secondary pollution to the ecological environment during a round of photocatalytic treatment fig 9c displayed that no e coli colony and a few b subtilis colonies were observed respectively on the culture dishes with the addition of original cip molecules photocatalytic treatment for 0 min indicating that the cip molecules had strong inactivation effect on e coli and b subtilis however when the cip molecules were photocatalyzed for a certain time their toxicity effects on the two bacteria gradually weakened furthermore compared with the blank group the toxicity effect of cip molecules with 120 min of photocatalytic treatment on the growth of e coli and b subtilis was negligible signifying that 5 lb can significantly degrade cip molecules into less toxic intermediates or even completely mineralize cip molecules after 120 min of light exposure this experimental phenomenon was consistent with the toxicity evaluation results of degradation intermediates by toxicity estimation software t e s t fig s12 4 conclusion the photocatalytic degradation of pops using eco friendly 5 lb photocatalyst was evaluated in water wastewater under both simulated visible light and actual solar light irradiation and the toxicity of the photocatalyst and treated solution was assessed 5 lb photocatalysts exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance which could degrade 91 49 92 47 of cip and 79 37 95 of bpa with 2h of visible light actual solar light irradiation this can be attributed to the successful formation of co cl bonded heterojunction between 2d bi12o17cl2 and 2d coal ldh which induces broad absorption spectrum rapid photogenerated carrier migration and abundant active site exposure furthermore 5 lb shows good reusability over three cycles for photocatalytic cip degradation under visible light irradiation the degradation process dominated by h and 1o2 the active atoms of cip molecule with high fukui index interpret the c f bond cleavage ring hydroxylation nucleophilic addition and aldehyde reaction under the attack of reactive radicals the ph value organic matter e g ha and suspended matter e g ps are found to significantly influence the photocatalytic performance multivalent anions co3 2 so4 2 have more adverse effects than monovalent anions cl no3 on the photocatalytic degradation therefore under illumination of actual sunlight 5 lb perform well in tap water and wastewater effluent while unsatisfactory in wastewater inflow thus 5 lb photocatalytic technology is more suitable to apply in the after stage of water treatment in the toxicity assessment 5 lb photocatalyst itself and the treated cip solution exhibited negligible effects on the growth of e coli and b subtilis it reflects the potential of photocatalytic degradation using 5 lb for the green and safe application in real water treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15915,the widespread distribution of persistent organic pollutants pops in natural waters has aroused global concern due to their potential threat to the aquatic environment photocatalysis represents a promising mean to remediate polluted waters with the simple assistance of solar energy herein we fabricated a co cl bond reinforced coal ldh bi12o17cl2 heterogeneous photocatalyst to investigate the feasibility of photocatalysis to treat pops polluted water under environmental conditions the optimum coal ldh bi12o17cl2 5 lb composite photocatalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance which could degrade 92 47 of ciprofloxacin cip and 95 of bisphenol a bpa with 2h of actual solar light irradiation in changsha china n 28 12 e 112 59 in view of the synergistic influence of water constituents various water matrices greatly affected the degradation rate of cip bpa with the degradation efficiency of 82 17 84 37 in tap water 69 67 71 63 in wastewater effluent and 44 07 67 7 in wastewater inflow the results of electron spin resonance and chemical trapping experiment hplc ms and density functional theory calculation reflected that the degradation of cip was mainly attributed to h and 1o2 attacking the active atoms of cip molecule with high fukui index furthermore the non toxicity of both 5 lb photocatalyst and treated cip solution was proved by e coli and b subtilis cultivation which further demonstrated the feasibility of the 5 lb to treat pops in real water under irradiation of solar light graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words photocatalysis bi12o17cl2 coal ldh ciprofloxacin degradation actual sunlight toxicity assessment 1 introduction persistent organic pollutants pops e g pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupters with high toxicity carcinogenicity and bioaccumulation in the aquatic ecosystem are both tedious and expensive to treat dong et al 2015a towards the treatment of pops in water and wastewater many advanced technologies with high efficiency and low cost have been developed to date including adsorption microbial degradation electrolysis and photocatalysis dong et al 2015a pi et al 2018 among these methods environmentally friendly photocatalysis is superior in terms of its outstanding ability on complete destroying the contaminates with the simple aid of solar energy sun et al 2020 yang et al 2022 in practical application ideal photocatalysts are required to achieve excellent solar light absorption and fast conversion dong et al 2015b wu et al 2018 two dimensional 2d layered materials demonstrate unique ability of confinement of electrons in their layer leading to exceptional optical and electronic properties xiong et al 2018 besides the strong in plane covalent bonding furnishes sites for the construction of heterostructures the resulting 2d 2d heterojunction with greater contact area possesses plentiful tight and high speed charge transfer channels at interfacial junction for convenient migration of charge ganguly et al 2019 bismuth oxyhalide is one of a new class of 2d layered materials for photocatalytic energy conversion and environment remediation specially the bismuth rich ones such as bi12o17cl2 guo et al 2021 and bi24o31br10 shang et al 2014 have been confirmed to possess higher photon absorption efficiency and more negative conduction band positions that can meet most of the reaction potential it is worth noting that the yellow bi12o17cl2 illustrate outstanding visible light photocatalytic performance for pollutant degradation whereas the fast recombination of photogenerated charges still hindered the further application of bi12o17cl2 li et al reported that the internal electric field between bi12o17 and cl2 can actuate the transfer of electrons from bi12o17cl2 to other semiconductors li et al 2016 furthermore the interlaminar cl can form chemical bonding with foreign cations which further favors the heterogenous migration of carriers zhu et al 2021 therefore we hypothesized that the construction of a heterostructure between bi12o17cl2 and another 2d semiconductor with a matching band structure will be a promising way to enhance the separation efficiency of photoexcited carriers meanwhile acquire improved photocatalytic performance of bi12o17cl2 layered double hydroxides ldhs m1 x 2 mx 3 oh 2 an x n mh2o also known as hydrotalcite like clays are another kind of 2d laminated materials which possess the merits of low cost facile preparation large surface area flexible interlayer structure for electron transfer visible light response performance and abundant active sites tang et al 2016 in recent years ldhs are highlighted for their capacity to enhance catalytic activity in cooperation with other functional materials lee et al reported that the coal ldhs with the band gap of 2 1 ev can serve as the visible light absorber to hybridize with p25 kumar et al 2017 wu et al clarified that the unoccupied d orbitals of co or al atoms of coal ldh can couple with the n atoms of g c3n4 to form covalent bonding states thereby promoting the separation and transfer of photoexcited charges wu et al 2018 thus it is expected to improve the photochemical properties of bi12o17cl2 by coupling with coal ldh in this study we firstly fabricated the eco friendly coal ldh bi12o17cl2 x lb photocatalysts via a facile hydrothermal method and the performance of lb hybrids for pops removal was evaluated by their degradation ability for ciprofloxacin cip and bisphenol a bpa under simulate visible light meanwhile the radical trapping experiments esr measure hplc ms and density functional theory dft calculation were conducted to deduce the photocatalytic pathway and mechanism then the influence of the water characteristics e g ph anions natural dissolved organic matter and microplastics on photocatalytic performance was investigated to evaluate the potential application of x lb in a real environment on this basis degradation of pops in different natural water matrices under the irradiation of natural solar light was also carried out to verify the practical feasibility last but not least the toxicity of the treated pops solution and the leaching solution of x lb was assessed by toxic effects on typical bacteria the potential for eliminating the threat of pops in natural environmental conditions without causing secondary pollution via bismuth oxyhalides based photocatalyst was verified in this study 2 experimental section 2 1 synthesis of coal ldh bi12o17cl2 all used chemicals were listed in text s1 and were used as received the coal ldh bi12o17cl2 hybrids were synthesized by an in situ method and the detailed process was described in text s2 2 2 photocatalytic activity measurement to investigate the photocatalytic activity of coal ldh bi12o17cl2 hybrids a series of photodegradation experiments were conducted by using cip and bpa as target pollutants under the visible light irradiation and the detailed process was presented text s3 reactive oxygen species ros were studied by electron spin esr spectroscopy jes fa200 jeol japan apparent time based cip rate constants were determined with and without quenching agents to reflect reaction mechanisms detailed information about ros investigation was presented in text s4 the obtained data were used to determine the

bpa powder to 0 45 μm membrane filtered tap water changsha china wastewater inflow changsha china and wastewater effluent changsha china and the photocatalysis experiments were carried out from 13 00

evaluated the toxicity and the detailed information was presented in text s5 2 4 theoretical calculation method the fukui index of cip was calculated by gaussian 16w program and the calculation details were described in supporting information text s6 lu and chen 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 crystalline chemical and morphology structures the crystalline structures of the as prepared samples were analyzed by xrd fig 1 a the boc patterns exhibited a series of strong diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 23 2 24 3 26 4 29 2 30 4 32 9 45 5 47 2 54 9 56 5 corresponding respectively to the 111 113 115 117 0012 200 2012 220 315 and 317 lattice planes of the standard tetragonal bi12o17cl2 jcpds 37 0702 for the pure ldh the peaks at 11 7 23 5 and 34 6 can be assigned to 003 006 and 009 lattice planes of a stacked ldh phase with co3 2 in the interlayer region dou et al 2015 x lb hybrids demonstrated a similar xrd patterns of boc indicating the integration of these two semiconductors with high purity and degree of crystallinity the peaks of ldh were inconspicuous due to its low contents and only when the content of ldh reached 3 wt the peaks at 23 5 and 34 6 of ldh can be observed collectively the two semiconductors were well combined and the introduction of ldh did not affect the phase of boc for further determine the surface elemental compositions and valence states of the as prepared photocatalysts and provide a better understanding of the interaction between boc and ldh x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis was introduced based on the xps survey spectra fig 1b the presence of co element in 5 lb further confirmed the successful fabrication of the composite furthermore the high resolution xps spectra of bi 4f cl 2p co 2p and o 1s were revealed in fig 1c f as shown in the high resolution spectra of bi 4f the binding energy for bi 4f 5 2 and 4f 7 2 of boc were 164 3 and 159 0 ev the peak positions did not alter after the introduction of ldh indicating that ldh exhibited negligible effect on the original structure of bi12o17 slab whereas the characteristic peak at 199 6 and 197 9 ev corresponding to cl 2p1 2 and cl 2p3 2 of cl ions upshifted to a higher energy level 199 8 and 198 2 ev after the modification of ldh the shifts of binding energy verified that coupling interaction occurred between boc and ldh which affected the electronic energy distribution of boc simultaneously the position of co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 characteristic peaks in 5 lb composites downshifted from 781 6 and 797 7 ev to 781 2 and 797 4 ev respectively wang et al 2017 which indicated that the electrons of cl atoms as electron donor can interact with the unoccupied d orbitals of co atoms to form co cl bond with the minimal space constraints liu et al 2019 wu et al 2018 this was further confirmed by the high resolution xps spectra of o 1s fig 1f the o 1s peak of ldh at 531 6 and 532 9 ev corresponded respectively to the co o and al o species in ldh and the peaks of boc at 529 7 531 0 and 532 8 ev were ascribed to lattice bi o bi bond surface hydroxyl and adsorbed h2o respectively guo et al 2021 wang et al 2017 interestingly the binding energies of lattice co o species for 5 lb were 531 5 ev and the conversion trend of the binding energy value of co o is in keeping with that of co 2p however the peaks for bi o bi bond surface hydroxyl and adsorbed h2o on 5 lb maintained unchanged demonstrating that ldh did not connect to boc via o containing chemical bonds thus all the results above clarified that the formation of intimate heterostructure between ldh and boc was attribute to the formation of co cl bond at the interface and co atoms on the heterojunction possess lower binding energy compared to pristine ldh may be ascribed to the acquisition of electrons in the heterogeneous system resulting the increase of electron density wang et al 2020 reversely the electrons escape of cl atoms leads to the decrease of electron density reflecting as higher binding energy the sem images of pure ldh boc and 5 lb were exhibited in fig 2 clearly the fabricated ldh crystal nanosheets were of hexagonal shapes the pure boc exhibited irregular and compactly agglomerated two dimensional structure after dispersing the ldh nanosheets into aqueous solution via ultrasonication under the solvothermal condition ldh sheets acted as a substrate to induce the in situ growth of boc in a plane to plane manner as shown in fig 2c and d a large amount of boc sheets dispersed on the surface of ldh substrate which facilitated the dispersal of boc furthermore edx element mapping was carried out on the area shown by fig 2d which demonstrated that bi cl co o were distributed throughout the 5 lb samples fig 2e h additionally the bright hexagonal region of co element further indicated that the hexagonal nanosheet in fig 2d could be ascribed to ldh the tem images further confirmed the microstructure of the hexagonal ldh sheets fig s1a and the 2d structure of the pure boc fig s1b as for 5 lb hybrids fig s1c both hexagonal ldh sheets and 2d boc could be observed meanwhile two types of contrast fringes in the hrtem image of 5 lb hybrids fig s1d was found the lattice spacing of 0 259 nm was correspond to the 012 plane of the ldh phase and the lattice fringes of 0 338 nm were ascribed to the 115 plane of the boc phase the surface area and porosity of the photocatalysts play a significant role in their photocatalytic performance as displayed in the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig s2a the typical iv isotherm with an h3 hysteresis loop existed in all samples which confirmed the presence of mesoporous structure the specific surface area pore volume and average pore size were shown in table s1 and fig s2b obviously boc possessed a small specific surface area 4 391 m2g 1 and poor mesoporous feature which may limit the photocatalytic activity while ldh possessed the relatively larger specific surface area 38 975 m2g 1 fortunately the addition of 5 wt ldh increased the specific surface area of boc to 2 2 times 9 666 m2g 1 and the mesoporous features became more obvious which may promote the exposure of the active sites and the diffusion of contaminants and active radicals during the photocatalytic process 3 2 photocatalytic performance herein cip molecules have been adopted to assess the capability for eliminating pops of the as prepared x lb composites with different content of ldh fig 3 a depicted the changes of the cip concentration over time dark and irradiation time in the presence of the as synthesized photocatalysts after 120 min dark reaction and 120 min visible light irradiation λ 420 nm approximately 7 19 and 62 76 of cip was removed over bare ldh and bare boc respectively besides it was obvious that coupling ldh with boc could effectively improve the removal efficiency of cip and the optimal removal effect appeared in 5 lb where 96 37 of cip was removed from the solution it was worth noting that x lb composites had stronger adsorption capacity than pure boc in order to eliminate the influence of adsorption on the experimental data in the light stage we firstly conducted the adsorption tests of above photocatalysts for cip under the dark condition as illustrated in fig 3b ldh boc and 5 lb reached adsorption equilibrium at about 120 min implying that the adsorption process wouldn t further interfere with the subsequent analysis of photocatalytic results furthermore the adsorption kinetics results were fitted with pseudo first order model solid lines in fig 3b and pseudo second order model dashed lines in fig 3b respectively and the fitted parameters were listed in table s2 pseudo second order kinetics process was more suitable for the adsorption process of ldh r2 0 99252 and boc r2 0 9994 which reflected that the chemical adsorption was the rating limiting step in the adsorption process of ldh and boc yu et al 2021 for 5 lb the pseudo first order model r2 0 99968 was more suitable meanwhile pseudo second order model r2 0 99162 also exhibited high degree of fit this result indicating that the adsorption process of 5 lb was more inclined to physisorption interaction although chemisorption also played an important role tang et al 2018 afterwards adsorption isotherm models analysis interpreted fig s3 that the langmuir isotherm model showed better correlation than freundlich isotherm model for ldh boc and 5 lb which indicated that the monolayer adsorption is the main adsorption process of above materials toward cip perez marin et al 2007 subsequently the photocatalytic performance of the as prepared photocatalysts could be investigated fig 3c showed that there was no reduction in the concentration of cip in the presence of a pure ldh after 120 min of visible light irradiation and boc exhibited relatively higher activity with the degradation efficiency of 57 12 whereas all the x lb hybrids displayed higher photocatalytic degradation activity this indicated that the synergistic effect between ldh and boc played a significant role in the photocatalytic process although ldh exhibited a poor cip degradation performance furthermore the coupling content of ldh highly affected the degradation effect of cip specifically the photocatalytic degradation efficiency increased gradually with the rise of ldh content from 1 wt to 5 wt and 5 lb exhibited the optimum performance where 91 49 of cip was decomposed however further increasing the coupling content of ldh to 10 wt led to the attenuation of photocatalytic effect this phenomenon might be due to that the increased co2 or al3 contacted with boc more exposed heterojunction sites for charge transfer were built up but the quality and quantity of effective heterointerfaces favorable for charge transfer decreased which in turn reduced photocatalytic performance on the other hand wu et al 2018 thus the control over the ratio of ldh to boc was essential to achieve optimal photocatalytic performance meanwhile the degradation kinetics curves have been fitted according to the pseudo first model and the values of rate constants k were shown in fig 3d it was obvious that the cip degradation rate was the fastest for 5 lb 0 0214 min 1 besides the photocatalytic activity of 5 lb was further estimated toward the photodegradation of a typical endocrine disrupter bisphenol a bpa the photodegradation efficiency could reach 79 37 over 5 lb fig 3e giving a degradation rate of 0 0121 min 1 under visible light irradiation the degradation rate of 5 lb was almost 1 75 and 24 69 folds higher than that of pure boc and pure ldh fig 3f furthermore the stability of the 5 lb was investigated to ensure that this activity was reproducible over sequential treatment cycles as exhibited in fig s4 after three repeated treatments 5 lb still possessed an excellent removal capacity for cip and the cip degradation efficiency was 84 84 on the third cycling run slightly lower than that of the initial round 91 49 in brief these results reflected the potential advantages of 5 lb for ameliorating concerns with pops in real systems 3 3 optical and photoelectrochemical property in order to understand the reasons for the excellent photocatalytic performance the optical electrical properties of the photocatalysts have also been studied by uv vis spectrum uv vis drs and photoelectrochemical tests as illustrated in fig s5a pure boc exhibited a strong absorption from the ultraviolet to visible light range and its band gap absorption edge was around 580 nm bare ldh displayed two distinct absorption bands where the one that appeared in the uv range could be assigned to ligand to metal charge transfer o2 mn and the other broad band centered around 500 nm was attributable to d d transitions of octahedral co2 within the ldh layer kumar et al 2017 this typical light absorption of ldh in the visible range could also be observed in the 5 lb composite implying the strong interaction between boc and ldh in the resulting heterojunction notably compared with boc 5 lb exhibited a clear red shift in the absorption edge and an intensified light absorption in the visible region which makes this hybrid a promising material for solar light driven catalytic applications additionally the band gap of pure boc and ldh were estimated to be 2 13 and 2 1 ev respectively according to the tauc plot in fig s5b furthermore the mott schottky plots fig s5c d exhibited that both boc and ldh showed n type semiconductor properties huang et al 2017 and their vfb were identified to be 0 9 and 0 81 v vs sce respectively corresponding to the conduction band cb potentials of 0 76 and 0 67 v vs nhe respectively hence the valence band vb potentials were determined to be 1 37 and 1 43 v vs nhe via the formula eg evb ecb fig s5e clearly displayed that the photocurrent intensity of 5 lb was much higher than that of bare boc and ldh indicating the enhanced separation efficiency of photo induced electron hole pairs simultaneously fig s5f depicted that the 5 lb possessed the lowest charge migration resistance which confirmed that the formation of co cl bond between boc and ldh expedited the transfer of photo excited charges therefore it was reasonably induced that the boosted photochemical properties promoted the photocatalytic performance furthermore the photoluminescence pl analysis fig s6 showed that the emission peak of 5 lb hybrid was lower than that of pure ldh and pure boc which further confirmed that the recombination of photogenerated carriers were effectively suppressed because of the interfacial charge transfer between ldh and boc 3 4 role of reactive species in cip degradation chemical quenchers were applied to the experimental solutions to elucidate the contribution of specific reactive species to cip degradation fig 4 a showed the extents of cip degradation after 120 min of irradiation for the blank control and solutions containing ipa tempol na2c2o4 and nan3 were approximately 91 49 90 37 59 22 44 50 and 42 23 respectively furthermore the observed rate constants for cip degradation were 0 0214 0 01973 0 00694 0 00462 and 0 00416 min 1 respectively fig 4b using eqs 1 4 the relative contributions of oh o2 h and 1o2 to the overall cip degradation were calculated to be 7 8 67 6 78 4 and 72 8 respectively note that the contributions sum to more than 100 because the generation of 1o2 involved o2 and h eq 8 10 and eq 12 that is when o2 or h was quenched by a scavenger the effect of 1o2 was also inhibited wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 nevertheless h and 1o2 production by the 5 lb photocatalytic system were found to be the major mechanism of cip degradation the esr signals further verified the role of 1o2 and o2 during the photocatalytic process fig 4c e at the same irradiation point in time 10 min the signal intensity of tmpo 1o2 was much stronger than dmpo o2 and the signal intensity of dmpo oh was not obvious indicating that the 1o2 was the major reactive radical followed by o2 and the oh only played a minor role 3 5 degradation pathways of cip to elucidate the photocatalytic mechanisms associated with cip degradation transformation products were identified by samples collected at 0 60 and 120 min of irradiation for lc ms analysis the total ms spectra of possibly molecular intermediates at different reaction time were listed in figs s7 and s8 and 12 major transformation products were confirmed table s3 apparently the peak intensity of cip molecule m z 332 gradually decreased with the illumination time while the peak intensity of the substances with smaller m z values were first increase with irradiation time and then decrease upon further irradiation which means that cip was gradually degraded into small molecule products by 5 lb and further illumination mineralized these products furthermore the toc removal experiment fig s9 manifested that 5 lb can mineralize cip more efficiently and 66 3 of cip was mineralized into inorganic small molecules co2 and h2o etc after 2h illumination to better examine the mechanisms that produced the 12 identified transformation products during photocatalysis of cip the npa charge distribution and fukui index were used to predict the sites of reactive species attack the results of this analysis were summarized in fig 5 according to fukui function theory a high f value suggests that an atom is more like to be attacked by electrophilic reagent h 1o2 a high positive point charge indicates the likelihood of o2 attack nucleophilic reaction and a high f0 value indicates that an atom is likely to be attacked by and oh the 6n 2o 13c 23c 1f and 4o positions exhibited high f values suggesting the potential for h and 1o2 attack the 24c 19c 23c 12c 15c and 11c positions displayed high positive point charges and so these positions are expected to undergo preferential attack by o2 high f0 values were calculated for the 2o 6n 12c 22c 19c and 23c positions demonstrating that these sites may be directly attack by oh li et al 2021 these analyses were used with the identified transformation products to propose a tentative cip photocatalytic pathway for the 5 lb vis system fig 6 pathway i was mainly a defluorination and hydroxylation process which has been widely reported for degradation of fluoroquinolones lai et al 2019 wen et al 2018 specifically the transformation from cip to p1 was subjected to attacking at 1f f 0 0401 23c q 0 0829 f 0 0503 f0 0 0438 22c f0 0 0464 and 12c q 0 048 f0 0 052 which leads to the cleavage of the c f bond of cip and the addition of a hydroxyl then the quinolone ring was broken resulting in the formation of p2 in pathway ii it is detected that the intermediate product p3 was generated through the nucleophilic addition reaction which is consistent with the nucleophilic site calculated by dft this mechanisms align with previous reports of photocatalysis of cip antibiotics by tio2 hu et al 2020 pathway iii was the aldehyde reaction according to the fukui index 6n position is most vulnerable to active species in piperazine rings but it is difficult for 6n to accept radical addition due to saturation sites and steric hindrance meanwhile due to the strong electron withdrawing property of tertiary amine 6n the α carbon 17c in piperazine ring became the next most susceptible position to be attacked by surrounding active species zheng et al 2018 1o2 attacked the 17c in cip to form endoperoxide eq 5 which would further decompose to form acetaldehyde groups in a similar manner as that reported by li et al li et al 2021 liu et al 2021 wei et al 2015 the formed product p1 were prone to be attacked by h and subsequent hydrolysis to generated p2 and p2 isomers chen et al 2019 furthermore the aldehyde groups decomposed resulting in formation of the p4 and p6 ultimately the identified products from all four pathways were photodegraded into smaller oxygen containing compounds and then being mineralized into water and carbon dioxide 5 3 6 photocatalytic mechanism governing the 5 lb photocatalytic system on the basis of the above results and the energy levels of coal ldh and bi12o17cl2 the mechanism shown in fig 7 was proposed for 5 lb photocatalytic system the boc nanosheets were evenly immobilized on the surface of ldh in a plane to plane manner via co cl bond compared with pure boc nanosheets the ldh nanosheets as substrate material suppressed the agglomeration of boc thereby the relatively higher surface volume ratio made more adsorption sites of boc be exposed this allowed more pops molecules to be adsorbed onto the boc surface during the dark reaction stage which was conducive to further degradation under visible light illumination both ldh and boc could be activated into excited state and generated electrons and holes see eq 6 7 considering the stagger arrangement of band positions for boc and ldh the photoexcited electrons could thermodynamically transfer from the cb of boc to the cb of ldh whereas holes migrated oppositely in the vb due to the built in electric field at the interface therefore the photoexcited electrons and holes were effectively separated in micro space 6 ldh hv ldh h e 7 boc hv boc h e since the cb potential of ldh was more negative than the standard reduction potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev the conduction band e can be captured by dissolved oxygen to form o2 see eq 8 subsequently the o2 reacts with h eq 9 to produce 1o2 eq 10 and oh eq 11 chen et al 2019 meanwhile o2 can also be oxidized by h to form 1o2 eq 12 luo et al 2021 wang et al 2019 in addition the free radical trapping experiments show that the contribution of o2 is lower than that of 1o2 which means that the generation of 1o2 also experienced other pathways such as dissolved oxygen from water eq 13 liang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 the h gathered on the vb of boc with a potential of 1 37 ev is difficult to react with water or ho to form oh thus the oh in the 5 lb photocatalytic system was derived from o2 initiated reactions and the esr results showed that the generation of oh was limited this explained why oh the played a negligible role in the degradation of cip while the h and 1o2 dominated the cip transformation 8 e o2 o2 9 o2 h ho2 10 2ho2 h2o2 1o2 11 h2o2 e oh oh 12 o2 h 1o2 13 3o2 1o2 energy transfer 3 7 effects of water quality and interfering substances on cip photocatalysis the effect of ph value on the photocatalytic performance was shown in fig 8 a and fig s10a the observed rate constant for cip degradation increased from 0 00357 min 1 at ph 3 0 to 0 0181 min 1 at ph 9 0 then decreased to 0 0101 at ph 11 0 this change trend was related to the surface properties of the photocatalyst and the states of the cip molecules as known the cip molecule can form five molecular species including cip3 species ph 3 01 cip2 species 3 01 ph 6 14 cip species 6 14 ph 8 70 cip species 8 70 ph 10 58 and cip species ph 10 58 yu et al 2021 obviously the ph value of 10 58 is the watershed of the states of cip molecules meanwhile the different ph value leaded to the alterations in the zeta potentials of 5 lb and the results were shown in fig 8b when the ph was in the range of 3 9 the surface of 5 lb possessed positive charges with a downward trend thus the electrostatic repulsion with cip species was gradually diminished which favored the attachment of cip molecules to the photocatalytic active sites on the surface of 5 lb nevertheless the surface of 5 lb was negatively charged at ph value of 11 where cip molecules possessed the same electronegativity indicating that the repulsive force between 5 lb and the deprotonated cip was intensified and thereby led to an inferior cip degradation efficiency the results of adsorption experiments fig s10b almost agreed with the above conclusions the effects of water quality constituents on the performance for cip photocatalysis were shown in fig 8c among the studied anions the multivalent anions so4 2 co3 2 indicated a more adverse effect than monovalent anions cl and no3 on photocatalytic cip degradation this is probably due to the stronger adsorption of multivalent ions than monovalent ions on electropositive photocatalyst surface which consequently hindered the reaction of the cip molecules with the active site thus the amount of cip molecules attached to the surface of 5 lb was decreased the adsorption experiment well evidenced this phenomenon fig s10c it was obvious that the adsorption of cip molecules on 5 lb was severely inhibited by co3 2 while cl and no3 exerted little influence besides the co3 2 can hydrolyze to generate oh ions and hco3 ions leading to the enhancement of the ph value from 5 6 to 11 7 which is detrimental to photocatalytic activity fig 8a furthermore the different effects of the various ions can also attribute to the reaction kinetics between the active species and anions for example it is reported that co3 2 possess high ability of hole capture and the rate constant for co3 2 reaction with oh to be 3 7 108 m 1 s 1 david behar 1970 tan et al 2019 humic acid ha composed of aromatics and various functional groups is complex organic molecules produced by the decomposition of plant and animals and widely exists in natural water therefore it is necessary to understand the effect of ha on 5 lb photocatalytic activity as fig 8d exhibited the degradation efficiency of cip was significantly restrained by the ha and the inhibitory effect increased with the concentration of ha this may be due to the competitive interaction of ha with reactive species and light screening effects induced by the conjugated double bonds chromophoric structure of ha in the visible region fig 8 yang et al 2021 meanwhile ha with negative charges is easily adsorbed to the surface of 5 lb and block the active sites which impedes the adsorption of cip to the surface of 5 lb fig s10d thereby inhibiting the photodegradation of cip recently the ubiquitous microplastics in aquatic environment has attracted wide attention feng et al 2021 in this case polystyrene ps particles were added into the reaction system to evaluate the effect of microplastics on 5 lb photocatalytic system fig s10e interestingly relatively lower concentrations of ps 10 mg l 1 reduced the degradation rate of cip but had little effect on the final degradation effect however higher concentration of 20 mg l 1 inhibited the degradation efficiency obviously and only 80 18 of cip was degraded similarly the reduction of degradation efficiency could also be attributed to the contact restraint of cip with 5 lb fig s10f to better evaluate the suitability of the 5 lb to degrade pops under environmental conditions cip and bpa degradation were studied in different water matrices under the natural sunlight illumination the primary chemical properties of the real water matrices were shown in table s4 as indicated in fig 8f cip had a weak photolysis under natural sunlight while bpa hardly underwent photolysis under natural sunlight irradiation besides the observed degradation efficiency for cip in ultrapure water tap water wastewater effluent and wastewater inflow were 92 47 82 17 69 67 and 44 07 respectively and that of bpa were 95 84 37 71 63 and 67 70 respectively surprisingly the photocatalytic performance of 5 lb in ultrapure water under natural sunlight illumination was even slightly better than that of xenon lamp in view of the strong light intensity of xenon lamp we believe that the superior photocatalytic effect under natural sunlight may be caused by the unfiltered ultraviolet light and the thermal effect in order to verify this hypothesis we used an am 1 5g filter to provide simulated sunlight and the results and related analysis were shown in fig s11 ultrapure water exhibited the fastest cip and bpa degradation due to the absence of reactive species scavenging or light screening compared to ultrapure water the degradation of cip and bpa was inhibited in environmental waters especially in wastewater inflow due to the scavenging effects caused by organic toc 6 48 mg l 1 cod 85 8 mg l 1 and inorganic matters cl 23 1 mg l 1 so4 2 21 2 mg l 1 these results suggested that 5 lb sunlight photocatalytic system for ameliorating concerns with pops are most applicable in after stage of water treatment 3 8 toxicity assessment using e coli and b subtilis as indicators the toxicity effects of the 5 lb photocatalysts and cip as well as its photocatalytic degraded intermediates were assessed by their impacts on the surviving bacterial colonies density compared to that of the blank as exhibited in fig 9 a the introduction of 5 lb leaching solution did not significantly change the bacterial colonies density compared to the blank sample similarly the growth curves of e coli and b subtilis fig 9b further demonstrated the negligible effects of 5 lb on bacteria manifesting that 5 lb cannot cause secondary pollution to the ecological environment during a round of photocatalytic treatment fig 9c displayed that no e coli colony and a few b subtilis colonies were observed respectively on the culture dishes with the addition of original cip molecules photocatalytic treatment for 0 min indicating that the cip molecules had strong inactivation effect on e coli and b subtilis however when the cip molecules were photocatalyzed for a certain time their toxicity effects on the two bacteria gradually weakened furthermore compared with the blank group the toxicity effect of cip molecules with 120 min of photocatalytic treatment on the growth of e coli and b subtilis was negligible signifying that 5 lb can significantly degrade cip molecules into less toxic intermediates or even completely mineralize cip molecules after 120 min of light exposure this experimental phenomenon was consistent with the toxicity evaluation results of degradation intermediates by toxicity estimation software t e s t fig s12 4 conclusion the photocatalytic degradation of pops using eco friendly 5 lb photocatalyst was evaluated in water wastewater under both simulated visible light and actual solar light irradiation and the toxicity of the photocatalyst and treated solution was assessed 5 lb photocatalysts exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance which could degrade 91 49 92 47 of cip and 79 37 95 of bpa with 2h of visible light actual solar light irradiation this can be attributed to the successful formation of co cl bonded heterojunction between 2d bi12o17cl2 and 2d coal ldh which induces broad absorption spectrum rapid photogenerated carrier migration and abundant active site exposure furthermore 5 lb shows good reusability over three cycles for photocatalytic cip degradation under visible light irradiation the degradation process dominated by h and 1o2 the active atoms of cip molecule with high fukui index interpret the c f bond cleavage ring hydroxylation nucleophilic addition and aldehyde reaction under the attack of reactive radicals the ph value organic matter e g ha and suspended matter e g ps are found to significantly influence the photocatalytic performance multivalent anions co3 2 so4 2 have more adverse effects than monovalent anions cl no3 on the photocatalytic degradation therefore under illumination of actual sunlight 5 lb perform well in tap water and wastewater effluent while unsatisfactory in wastewater inflow thus 5 lb photocatalytic technology is more suitable to apply in the after stage of water treatment in the toxicity assessment 5 lb photocatalyst itself and the treated cip solution exhibited negligible effects on the growth of e coli and b subtilis it reflects the potential of photocatalytic degradation using 5 lb for the green and safe application in real water treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

et al 2013 despite the great merits of water permeability and contaminants rejection membrane fouling caused by the accumulation of rejected materials always restricts the sustainable application of the nf membrane fan et al 2016 nom is the most serious foulant in surface water causing severe membrane fouling yang et al 2020 although a variety of pretreatments can be used prior to membrane filtration to mitigate membrane fouling and appropriate cleaning methods can partially restore the performances of nom fouled membrane the increasing energy consumption operating costs and degradation of membrane matrix are inevitable abdel karim et al 2021 tian et al 2018 membrane with anti adhesive and anti bacterial surface can availably enhance its antifouling ability there are numerous works introducing various nanofillers and surface modification techniques to improve fouling resistance of membrane araújo et al 2012 deng et al 2021 chemical grafting or depositing physical coating and employing additives are multiple methods for surface modification of membranes himstedt et al 2011 miller et al 2012 miller et al 2013 however most of the modifications are difficult or complicated to implement in practical applications more importantly the modified membrane surface can still be fouled during long term operation causing a decline of the membrane performance eventually furthermore the leaching of compounds such as nanoparticles and bactericide from modified membrane surface causes potential risk of environment ng et al 2013 besides most of the modification methods are difficult to regenerate on the other hand a coating layer on the membrane surface has attracted extensive attention in recent years since it can work as a protective layer to protect the underlying membrane ba et al 2010 nava ocampo et al 2020 son et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 generally the coating process can be performed by electrostatic adsorption hydrogen bonding covalent bonds and other interactions wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 carboxymethyl chitosan cmcs is a chitosan derivative containing hydroxyl amine and carboxylic acid groups zhao et al 2003 it has been used in diverse pharmaceutical and cosmetics applications such as toothpaste gingival gels artificial tears tapes for wound dressing tan et al 2016 cmcs is biocompatible biodegradable nontoxic low cost and possesses antibacterial effect shariatinia 2018 it has a great potential to be a coating material on the membrane surface inspired by chemical cleaning on membrane the present study aims to develop a coating decoating recoating strategy to promote resistance to nom fouling and sustainable reusability on nf membrane in water applications the coating treatment is represented to modify membrane by adsorption functional molecules while the decoating process can be carried out to remove the coating layer consequently any foulant that adheres on the top of layer will be efficiently removed by peeling coating layer off the membrane surface thus the membrane performance can be maximally recovered as the original pristine membrane afterwards the decoated membrane modified in situ with a new coating layer can be denoted as recoating process to regenerate the antifouling property of the membrane this sacrificial protective layer can be a physical barrier against fouling the whole procedure of membrane treatment is quantifiable and can be detected visually a series of modified membranes with coating layers were prepared and characterized humic acid ha bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate sa as the mimic of nom for fouling precursors were used to investigate the feasibility of coating decoating recoating strategy for mitigation of membrane fouling the long term performance of coating decoating recoating strategy was also evaluated 2 material and methods 2 1 membrane and chemicals flat sheet nf90 membrane was obtained from dow filmtec usa cmcs was purchased from shanghai macklin

rhodamine labeled concanavalin a con a was supplied by shanghai maokang biochemical co ltd china the water utilized throughout this experiment was deionized di water the decoating reagents in this study were mentioned in table 1 2 2 preparation of membranes with sacrificial protective layer 2 2 1 coating procedure cmcs was dissolved in di water to get a solution with different concentrations of 0 5 wt 1 wt and 2 wt the cmcs solution was poured onto the pristine nf90 p nf membrane and covered the membrane surface for 0 25 h 0 5 h and 1 h respectively after the reaction the membranes were rinsed by di water the cmcs coated membranes were denoted as c w t t nf where w is the coating concentration of cmcs and t is the coating time besides the c0 5t0 5 nf membrane was signed as c nf membrane the characterization of membranes was described in method s1 in supplementary material huang et al 2021 liu et al 2022a liu et al 2022b in order to quantify the cmcs coated on the membrane the coating layer was extracted from the coated membrane by ultrasonic treatment zhao et al 2022 the total organic carbon toc content in the suspension was measured with toc analysis toc l cph shimadzu japan method s2 in supplementary material 2 2 2 decoating procedure the decoating procedure is employed to remove the coating layer from the surface of membrane different decoating reagents applied to flush membrane surface were listed in table 1 the coated membranes were flushed by the decoating reagents under a cross flow velocity of 13 3 cm s for 0 5 h without pressure following with di water rinse for 0 5 h the flushed membrane was designated as decoated membrane and labeled as d nf membrane 2 2 3 recoating procedure in order to regenerate coating layer on the membrane after decoating the d nf membrane was re coated by cmcs solution for 0 5 h again and followed by water rinse the resulting membrane was named re coated membrane and labeled as rc nf membrane 2 3 membrane filtration performance the membrane performances were evaluated using a cross flow flat sheet membrane module with effective membrane area of 0 0145 m2 under the condition of transmembrane pressure tmp of 0 5 mpa temperature of 25 c and cross flow velocity of 13 3 cm s before test each membrane was pre pressurized for 1 h to ensure that membrane achieved a steady state a four step protocol was conducted to evaluate the water permeability of membrane figure s1a step 1 the pure water flux jw1 of p nf membrane was examined as a baseline step 2 the p nf membrane was coated by cmcs solution and then the pure water flux jw2 of c nf membrane was tested step 3 the c nf membrane was flushed by decoating reagents for 0 5 h without pressure following with di water rinse for 0 5 h pure water flux jw3 of d nf membrane was measured step 4 the d nf membrane was re coated by cmcs solution for 0 5 h again as step 2 the pure water flux jw4 of the rc nf membrane was recorded the rejections of nacl mgcl2 and na2so4 by p nf c nf d nf and rc nf membrane were also measured nacl mgcl2 and na2so4 solutions at a concentration of 2000 mg l were employed as the feed respectively the water flux and salt rejection were calculated by eq 1 and 2 1 j v a t 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where j l m 2h 1 is the permeate flux v l is the volume of permeation collected in the operation time t h and a m2 is the effective surface area cp mg l and cf mg l represented the salt concentrations in the permeate and feed solution respectively the flux recovery ratio of rc nf frrre can be estimated using the following equation 3 f r r r e j w 4 j w 2 100 frrre is an indicator reflecting the recoating behavior of membrane and is preferable to be nearly 100 2 4 nom fouling on the membrane the fouling propensity of modified membrane was assessed under the total recycle mode of filtration both retentate and permeate were recirculated to the feed reservoir bsa sa and ha were selected to simulate the foulants of nom all of membrane filtration process was operated at tmp of 0 5 mpa temperature of 25 c and the cross flow velocity of 13 3 cm s with nom foulant solution 0 5 g l 5 l for 15 h in fouling testing and 1 h for pure water flux detection the permeate fluxes of p nf and c nf membrane were recorded as illustrated in figure s1b the coating decoating recoating process was applied to mitigate fouling and recover membrane performance after step 1 and 2 as described in section 2 3 the initial water flux of p nf jw1 after compaction and water flux of c nf jw2 were measured the c nf was then filtrated with the feeds containing nom foulants for 15 h to obtain the flux under fouling condition jf after membrane was fouled the membrane was flushed by di water for 10 min to remove the residual foulant solution from the membrane surface and pipelines then the decoating procedure was conducted by the methods described in section 2 2 2 to remove coating layer as well as fouling layer on the membrane and the flux of d nf jw3 was measured finally the d nf membrane was re coated again as the procedure in section 2 2 3 the water flux of rc nf jw4 was recorded the fr r de was calculated to assess decoating efficiency after nom fouling 4 fr r de j w 3 j w 1 100 the fr r re of rc nf was calculated as eq 5 5 fr r re j w 4 j w 2 100 2 5 validity of coating decoating recoating protocol in long term test to evaluate membrane performance in long term test four cycles of nom foulant filtration were carried out for p nf membrane each cycle consisted of two stages filtration with feed containing nom foulants for 72 h and 0 2 hcl flushing for c nf membrane each cycle consisted of three stages filtration with feed containing nom foulants for 72 h 0 2 hcl decoating and cmcs recoating which has been described in section 2 4 for p nf membrane flux recovery ratio frr during four cycle filtration could be obtained using eq 6 6 f r r j d i j 0 100 where j0 is the original pure water flux of the p nf membrane jdi defines the pure water flux of p nf membrane after flushing by hcl solution in i cycle i 1 2 3 for c nf membrane flux recovery ratio frr was expressed through eq 7 7 f r r j r i j 0 100 where j0 is the original pure water flux of the c nf membrane jri is the pure water flux of rc nf membrane after cmcs recoating in i cycle i 1 2 3 3 result and discussion 3 1 effect of coating conditions on the membrane properties the surface morphologies of the p nf and coated membrane were visualized by sem and afm images in fig 1 the p nf membrane presented an appearance of a leaves structure with a rough surface morphology as shown in fig 1 a i after coated by 0 5 wt cmcs solution on the surface the leaves structure has been gradually covered by cmcs layer with the increasing coating time fig 1 a ii a iv the different surface morphology showed that cmcs had completely covered the membrane surface as shown in figure s2 the thickness of coating layer of c0 5t0 5 nf membrane was with an average size of 420 nm with the increasing cmcs concentration and coating time the amount of cmcs as coating layer on membrane surface increased figure s3 for example the toc content of c2t0 5 nf membrane increased about 2 8 times compared with c0 5t0 5 nf membrane as shown in fig 1 a iii v and vi at a constant coating time the coated membrane surface presented a denser coating layer with the increasing concentration the surface of c2t0 5 nf membrane was completely coated by cmcs while underlying nf90 support was not visible besides the coating layer made the surface smoother than the p nf membrane the results were also confirmed by fig 1 b the three dimensional afm images and the values of average roughness ra and root mean squared roughness rms were listed the rms values of p nf c0 5t0 25 nf c0 5t0 5 nf and c0 5t1 nf are 68 4 54 1 42 6 and 43 7 nm respectively the surface smoothness of membranes increased by cmcs coating when the coating time was 1 h the membrane surface got slightly rougher than that of 0 5 h besides the surface roughness of coated membrane increased gradually with the increasing cmcs concentration the increased coating time and concentration would make cmcs agglomerate and thus increased the surface roughness considering the roughness of membrane it was obvious that the surface of nf90 membrane coated by 0 5 wt cmcs for 0 5 h was the smoothest and it could be the most suitable for further studies 3 2 hydrophilicity and pure water flux of cmcs coated membranes the hydrophilicity of p nf and coated membrane was characterized by contact angle ca and pure water flux p nf membrane had the highest ca value which indicated that it was the most hydrophobic one among the membranes tested fig 2 a the coating of 0 5 wt cmcs for 0 25 h on the membrane surface showed ca value of 46 9 the carboxyl hydroxide radical and amino group of cmcs can enhance the hydrophilicity of membrane surface besides cmcs coating reduced the roughness of nf90 membrane which also can improve surface hydrophilicity shahabi et al 2019 the minimum ca was obtained by c0 5t0 5 nf membrane however the ca values increased with the increasing coating concentration which can be attributed to the variation of surface roughness fig 2 b presented the pure water flux of membrane similar to observations of ca an increase in the water flux was recorded from 41 7 lmh to 50 5 lmh as the coating time increased from 0 to 0 5 h the c0 5t0 5 nf membrane exhibited the highest flux the increased flux is mainly ascribed to the smoother and more hydrophilic membrane surface mentioned above cmcs is more hydrophilic for its numerous functional groups causing enhanced adsorption of water molecules on the membrane surface due to the higher intrinsic resistance of nf membrane membrane resistance to water permeation caused by the cmcs layer is negligible akbari et al 2015 sharma et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 however the flux of c0 5t1 nf membrane began to decrease which is owing to the thicker and denser layer by long coating time at the same time the aggregation induced by the high concentration of cmcs can increase mass transfer resistance which resulted in the decrease of flux huang et al 2019 therefore according to the outstanding performance of c0 5t0 5 nf c nf among the membranes it was selected for further research 3 3 characterization of c nf membrane as shown in fig 3 the characteristic peaks on p nf membrane at 1653 cm 1 1492 cm 1 1110cm 1 1153 cm 1 694 cm 1 and 1018 cm 1 were represented amide groups methyl groups aromatic double bonded carbon sulfone groups and ester groups respectively xu and drewes 2006 in the c nf membrane spectra appearance of peaks at 1606 and 1425 cm 1 were attributed to carboxylation of cmcs a strong peak at 1419 cm 1 can be corresponded to the symmetrical stretching vibration of coo group new peaks at 2930 cm 1 and 1054 cm 1 for c h stretch and c o c stretching were observed the peak at 1606 and 1425 cm 1 was attributed to the carboxylation of cmcs the peak of cmcs at 3421 cm 1 confirmed that carboxylation occurred at both primary hydroxyl and amino positions ekambaram and doraisamy 2017 the broad peak around 3400 3200 cm 1 belonged largely to vibration of n h stretching which suggested the cmcs layer coated on the membrane surface via hydrogen bonds it is concluded that the cmcs was successfully coated on nf90 membrane as shown in fig 2 a the ca of p nf membrane was 76 05 after cmcs coated the ca value of c nf membrane significantly decreased to be 25 76 indicating the increase of membrane surface hydrophilicity it is known that a membrane with smooth and hydrophilic surface demonstrates less tendency of fouling the water flux can be favored on c nf membrane the zeta potential values of p nf and c nf membrane at ph 4 to 10 are shown in fig 4 a negative surface charges were observed on both membranes the c nf membrane has a lower density of negative charges than p nf membrane at ph 4 7 this reduction in negative charge is attributed to the appearance of protonated amino group nh3 in cmcs layer panda et al 2015 combined with the result of atr ftir the cmcs layer coated on the membrane was performed by electrostatic adsorption and hydrogen bonding higher values of negative zeta potential on c nf membrane were observed at alkaline conditions corresponding to the deprotonation of carboxyl functional groups of cmcs and the slight hydrolysis of membrane by naoh musale et al 1999 since the organic foulant and microorganism are generally negatively charged lee et al 2009 the negative surface can provide an electrostatic repulsion to improve the anti adhesion efficiency against foulants on the membrane the salt rejection of p nf and c nf membrane was illustrated in fig 4 b c nf membrane exhibited higher salt rejection than p nf membrane rejection of na2so4 mgcl2 and nacl by p nf membrane was 91 89 85 18 and 80 95 while the rejection was 94 56 87 11 and 83 72 respectively by c nf membrane 3 4 assessment of nom fouling on the membranes ha bsa and sa were represented as different nom fractions in natural waters cheng et al 2016 details for test were given in supplementary material s3 the fouling induced by different nom fractions on p nf and c nf membrane were investigated fig 5 a the membrane fouling behaviors differed between different types of foulants for p nf membrane the flux of membrane with ha solution as the feed is higher than that of bsa this may be due to the lower negative charge of bsa resulting in a weaker charge repulsion between the membrane surface and bsa molecules and a higher quantity of attachment on membrane surface bai et al 2020 because of the large number of hydroxyl groups on sa molecular structure it shows strong intermolecular interaction by hydrogen bonding which results in a thicker cake layer on membrane surface therefore the flux curve for sa showed the most severe decline c nf membrane showed a similar trend but better performance comparing with p nf membrane the flux decline trend slowed down significantly and achieved relatively steady state the normalized flux of c nf of ha bsa and sa was maintained at 0 75 0 66 and 0 46 respectively it can be seen that antifouling property of nf membrane was enhanced by coating cmcs negative charge improved hydrophilicity and smoothness of c nf may decrease the nom membrane interaction forces leading to the reduction in adsorption and pores blocking caused by nom on the membrane bai et al 2020 as displayed in fig 5 b the surface of the fouled p nf membrane was fully covered with a dense foulant layer after filtration revealing severe membrane fouling for fouled c nf membrane the fouling layer was rather sparse and parts of the surface morphology of underlying membrane were clear the cmcs layer with hydrophilic and smooth surface can partially prevent the adhesion of foulants from feed water thus provides a protection to membrane surface against the accumulation of membrane foulants results from the selected membrane showed the improved resistance of membrane against nom fouling suggesting that cmcs coating strategy possessed the membrane superior antifouling performance 3 5 effect of decoating reagents on decoating efficiency 3 5 1 effect of decoating reagents on decoating recoating efficiency of c nf membrane the decoating efficiency with different decoating reagents is compared in table s1 the flux of d nf jw3 was compared to the flux of p nf jw1 to evaluate the decoating efficiency the decoating procedure restored the jw3 closer to jw1 indicating the higher decoating efficiency flux recovery ratio of rc nf frrre after decoated by some of the effective decoating reagents were shown in fig 6 the results showed that hcl solution was superior in decoating the cmcs layer as the jw3 after hcl solution flushing was almost completely recovered to jw1 this could indicate that the cmcs layer was almost removed from the membrane surface the 0 02 hcl solution showed the best capacity on decoating cmcs layer the possible mechanisms of decoating of cmcs layer by hcl solution may include i hydrolysis and solubilization kuzmenko et al 2005 and ii the weakened interaction between coating layer and membrane surface since the protonation of nh2 can form nh3 with the decreased ph value the interaction between cmcs and membrane can be easily erased goy et al 2009 shieh et al 2020 besides the hydrogen bonding can also be erased under acidic condition ba et al 2010 this was consistent with sem as showed in fig 7 a iii the surface structure of d nf membrane was restored to the same leaves structure as that of p nf membrane fig 7 a i besides the flux jw4 after recoating step was almost completely restored to jw2 with the best flux recovery as shown in fig 7 b clsm image visualized the distribution of cmcs on d nf and rc nf membrane the cmcs layer was almost completely removed after decoating on d nf membrane while the cmcs was homogeneously coated again on the rc nf membrane nevertheless the high flux of jw3 after decoated by 0 03 hcl solution appeared with the dropped rejection of salt this may be due to the membrane damage or expansion of membrane pores by the removal of adsorbed materials madaeni and samieirad 2010 to evaluate the decoating efficiency of different types of acid decoating reagent with strong acid hcl hno3 weak acid ch3cooh and organic acid c6h8o7 were performed the sem and clsm were also applied for analyzing the decoating results of each chemical reagent as shown in figure s4 and s5 there are still some cmcs molecules coated on membrane after treating with ch3cooh and c6h8o7 the dissolution of cmcs by ch3cooh and c6h8o7 were ineffective the residual cmcs enhanced the local membrane performance thus leading to a higher jw3 than jw1 and the limited decoating efficiency there was an increase in decoating efficiency with the increasing concentration of naoh solution accompanying with the frrre value more than 90 the cooh groups of cmcs molecule form coo due to the deprotonation of the carboxyl which will weaken the hydrogen bonding zhao et al 2003 besides the increased negative charge leads to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and cmcs layer such interaction forces can promote the detachment of cmcs from membrane surface the decoating efficiency with sds solution was quite poor the cmcs layer was not easily erased by 5 mm sds solution this is attributed to the lower sds concentration than the critical micelle concentration about 8 3 mm in di water ang et al 2006 the sds concentration with 10 mm had a better decoating efficiency the cleaning mechanism is known as the transport of foulants from the membrane to the bulk solution by forming sds micelles around them li and elimelech 2004 sds molecule has amphiphilic structure which can reduce the interfacial tension of adjacent molecules madaeni and samieirad 2010 with the concentration increased to 20 mm the jw3 showed much higher than jw1 probably because of an amount of sds retained on membrane which enhanced membrane hydrophilicity among the decoating reagents tested the hcl solution was most efficient in cmcs layer decoating after decoating procedure the protective layer was completely re coated and maintained excellent membrane performance referring to the decoating efficiency of the coating layer hcl solution naoh solution and sds solution were selected for evaluation the decoating efficiency of nom fouled membrane 3 5 2 feasibility of coating decoating recoating for nom fouling mitigation to mitigate nom fouling on the membrane the decoating reagents including 0 2 hcl solution 4 mm naoh solution and 10 mm sds solution were tested as membrane cleaning detergents flux and flux recovery ratio were shown in table 2 while bsa fouled membranes were visualized by clms to demonstrate fouling mitigation in fig 8 as for p nf membrane naoh solution flushing was the most efficient way to remove nom fouling layer and provided the highest fr r de than acid and sds flushing for example the fr r de achieved to 85 7 after naoh flushing the bsa fouled membrane table 2 as reported in previous research the protein fouling was mainly related to the formation of hydrophobic cake layer beyer et al 2010 the increasing ph effectively induced the dissolution of protein from membrane surface this result agreed well with the clsm image fig 8 b iv some of the bsa layer deposited on pristine membrane was removal however the results showed that the fr r de after treatment by sds solution for nom fouled membrane was poor hydrophobic tail of sds could not successfully adhere to the membrane surface owing to the repulsive electrostatic force between the negatively charged surfactant and negatively charged membrane surface as for hcl solution it could not effectively dissolve and completely remove the nom on p nf membrane the fr r de of nom fouled p nf membranes flushed by hcl solution were low in the case of nom fouled c nf membrane the coating layer reduced the accumulation of bsa fig 8 a vii and 8b vii the presence of cmcs coating increased the fr r de of naoh and the restored flux after recoating was higher than 90 as shown in fig 8 b ix the foulants and cmcs layer on surface of c nf membrane after naoh decoating decreased however the nom fouled c nf membrane decoated by sds solution appeared to be not effective after flushing by sds solution most cmcs coating layer still remained on membrane and the removal of bsa foulant layer is also incomplete fig 8 b x the hcl decoating showed excellent efficiency which was the same with the decoating efficiency mentioned above the water flux after flushed by 0 2 hcl solution jw3 restored to the original flux of p nf membrane indicating acid solution successfully peel off the coating layer along with membrane nom foulants for decoating each nom foulant c nf membrane the fr r de was higher than 98 5 as shown in fig 8 a viii after treatment with 0 2 hcl membrane the d nf membrane presented clean with almost no residue besides clsm image in fig 8 b viii also verified that almost no bsa and cmcs was observed on d nf membrane surface the morphology structure exhibited similar to a fresh one thus owing to the property of cmcs under different ph the coating layer possesses the membrane with decoating performance both fouling layer and coating layer can be facilely detached to maximally refresh the membrane surface subsequently a new cmcs layer was re coated on the recovered nf90 membrane to achieve membrane reuse the fr r re of rc nf membrane after decoated by hcl solution exhibited at least 98 demonstrating the excellent flux recovery property of the regeneration layer in summary hcl solution as decoating reagent can efficiently remove cmcs coating layer and nom fouling layer simultaneously in a synergistic manner the cmcs layer acts as a sacrificial layer to protect the underlying nf membrane after facile recoating process a new cmcs layer could be re coated on the membrane possessing a sustainable antifouling protection for nf membrane to further explore the recoating performance of the cmcs coating layer p nf and c nf membrane were fouled by nom foulants and decoated by 0 2 hcl solution for four cycles as depicted in fig 9 the recoating treatment could significantly recover the membrane flux after each decoating process the change of initial flux and flux pattern of rc nf membrane was minor between the cycles while the significant decline of flux was observed from p nf membrane as fouling cycles increasing from 1 to 4 c nf membrane remained high flux recovery with more than 95 5 at each cycle the results indicate that this strategy can endow the membrane with excellent recoating capacity and regenerate membrane performance 3 6 performance of coating decoating recoating strategy in long term process to further explore the strategy of coating decoating recoating in long term process the time dependent fluxes under nom fouling condition and corresponding frr for four cycles of 72 h filtration test were depicted in fig 10 the fluxes of p nf membrane were sharply declined with the increasing filtration cycle while the fluxes of c nf membrane were relatively steady in long term process for 12 days in comparison c nf membrane exhibited higher frr at each fouling cycle at the fourth period the frr value of p nf membrane of ha bsa and sa was only 27 89 23 81 and 12 6 respectively whereas for the c nf membrane the frr was 91 51 90 32 and 88 82 respectively it can be observed that the flux loss and flux recovery occurred for the p nf membrane was severe implying the serious irreversible membrane fouling even though the membrane cleaning was applied at the end of each cycle owing to the coating layer of c nf membrane the underlying membrane was protected with extremely low fouling during the long term filtration the water permeability of the rc nf membrane was relatively consistent ensuring coating decoating recoating performance was less affected by the long term fouling cycles 4 implications the present study provides a strategy of coating decoating recoating to eliminate nom fouling from nf membrane in water applications firstly a sacrificial protective layer can be coated on the membrane surface by a green and natural polymeric material i e cmcs the facile coating method results in a visible layer on membrane surface enhancing the mitigation of nom fouling the selection of coating polymer can be various but the natural and low cost polymers with favorable properties are preferred secondly the protective layer is sacrificial and can be easily decoated to achieve effective removal of nom fouling and recovering the original membrane performance since cmcs is nontoxic and biodegradable and it has promising applications in medical and food industries the potential risk of health and environment caused by decoated materials are negligible thirdly new cmcs layer is re coated on membrane surface again in situ to restore membrane performance with sacrificial protective layer considering the reuse of the recoating solution it is possible to maintain the constant cmcs concentration in the recoating solution or manipulate coating time to reach optimal coating performance rather than replacing the recoating solution after each cycle although the present study is based on flat sheet nf membrane in the plate and frame module the method can also be applicable for different membranes such as ro forward osmosis different membrane modules such as spiral wound and hollow fiber as well as different fouling such as inorganic scaling organic fouling biofouling this coating decoating recoating strategy is a promising method to promote antifouling property and sustainable reusability of membrane in practical applications in addition the coating decoating recoating strategy described in the present study is substrate independent and it is also applicable on various types of surfaces e g membrane spacer cooling tower which suffer from fouling issue 5 conclusions in this study a novel strategy namely coating decoating recoating was performed on nf membranes to promote its antifouling property the major conclusions were discovered as follows 1 cmcs coated membrane was fabricated via simple coating operation the coating layer has no negative effect on membrane intrinsic properties but improvement of permeability and antifouling performances 2 super clearance of nom fouling layer on the coated membrane was reached by decoating cmcs layer from the membrane surface the coated cmcs worked as a sacrificial layer to protect underlying nf membrane 3 regeneration of cmcs layer on the membrane could be easily reached by repeating coating procedure the membrane performances were maximally recovered after recoating procedure furthermore the simple coating decoating recoating procedure allowed the modification of membrane in situ 4 both short term and long term nom fouling tests showed that the coating decoating recoating strategy was feasible and maintained high flux recovery ratio during nf process 5 by selecting natural and low cost coating materials e g cmcs the coating decoating recoating strategy has a great potential to be a green economic and sustainable method for membrane antifouling in practical applications for water treatment author contributions

et al 2013 despite the great merits of water permeability and contaminants rejection membrane fouling caused by the accumulation of rejected materials always restricts the sustainable application of the nf membrane fan et al 2016 nom is the most serious foulant in surface water causing severe membrane fouling yang et al 2020 although a variety of pretreatments can be used prior to membrane filtration to mitigate membrane fouling and appropriate cleaning methods can partially restore the performances of nom fouled membrane the increasing energy consumption operating costs and degradation of membrane matrix are inevitable abdel karim et al 2021 tian et al 2018 membrane with anti adhesive and anti bacterial surface can availably enhance its antifouling ability there are numerous works introducing various nanofillers and surface modification techniques to improve fouling resistance of membrane araújo et al 2012 deng et al 2021 chemical grafting or depositing physical coating and employing additives are multiple methods for surface modification of membranes himstedt et al 2011 miller et al 2012 miller et al 2013 however most of the modifications are difficult or complicated to implement in practical applications more importantly the modified membrane surface can still be fouled during long term operation causing a decline of the membrane performance eventually furthermore the leaching of compounds such as nanoparticles and bactericide from modified membrane surface causes potential risk of environment ng et al 2013 besides most of the modification methods are difficult to regenerate on the other hand a coating layer on the membrane surface has attracted extensive attention in recent years since it can work as a protective layer to protect the underlying membrane ba et al 2010 nava ocampo et al 2020 son et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 generally the coating process can be performed by electrostatic adsorption hydrogen bonding covalent bonds and other interactions wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 carboxymethyl chitosan cmcs is a chitosan derivative containing hydroxyl amine and carboxylic acid groups zhao et al 2003 it has been used in diverse pharmaceutical and cosmetics applications such as toothpaste gingival gels artificial tears tapes for wound dressing tan et al 2016 cmcs is biocompatible biodegradable nontoxic low cost and possesses antibacterial effect shariatinia 2018 it has a great potential to be a coating material on the membrane surface inspired by chemical cleaning on membrane the present study aims to develop a coating decoating recoating strategy to promote resistance to nom fouling and sustainable reusability on nf membrane in water applications the coating treatment is represented to modify membrane by adsorption functional molecules while the decoating process can be carried out to remove the coating layer consequently any foulant that adheres on the top of layer will be efficiently removed by peeling coating layer off the membrane surface thus the membrane performance can be maximally recovered as the original pristine membrane afterwards the decoated membrane modified in situ with a new coating layer can be denoted as recoating process to regenerate the antifouling property of the membrane this sacrificial protective layer can be a physical barrier against fouling the whole procedure of membrane treatment is quantifiable and can be detected visually a series of modified membranes with coating layers were prepared and characterized humic acid ha bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate sa as the mimic of nom for fouling precursors were used to investigate the feasibility of coating decoating recoating strategy for mitigation of membrane fouling the long term performance of coating decoating recoating strategy was also evaluated 2 material and methods 2 1 membrane and chemicals flat sheet nf90 membrane was obtained from dow filmtec usa cmcs was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china bsa was bought from beijing solarbio biochemical technology co ltd china sa ha fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc were provided by sigma aldrich sigma aldrich shanghai china rhodamine labeled concanavalin a con a was supplied by shanghai maokang biochemical co ltd china the water utilized throughout this experiment was deionized di water the decoating reagents in this study were mentioned in table 1 2 2 preparation of membranes with sacrificial protective layer 2 2 1 coating procedure cmcs was dissolved in di water to get a solution with different concentrations of 0 5 wt 1 wt and 2 wt the cmcs solution was poured onto the pristine nf90 p nf membrane and covered the membrane surface for 0 25 h 0 5 h and 1 h respectively after the reaction the membranes were rinsed by di water the cmcs coated membranes were denoted as c w t t nf where w is the coating concentration of cmcs and t is the coating time besides the c0 5t0 5 nf membrane was signed as c nf membrane the characterization of membranes was described in method s1 in supplementary material huang et al 2021 liu et al 2022a liu et al 2022b in order to quantify the cmcs coated on the membrane the coating layer was extracted from the coated membrane by ultrasonic treatment zhao et al 2022 the total organic carbon toc content in the suspension was measured with toc analysis toc l cph shimadzu japan method s2 in supplementary material 2 2 2 decoating procedure the decoating procedure is employed to remove the coating layer from the surface of membrane different decoating reagents applied to flush membrane surface were listed in table 1 the coated membranes were flushed by the decoating reagents under a cross flow velocity of 13 3 cm s for 0 5 h without pressure following with di water rinse for 0 5 h the flushed membrane was designated as decoated membrane and labeled as d nf membrane 2 2 3 recoating procedure in order to regenerate coating layer on the membrane after decoating the d nf membrane was re coated by cmcs solution for 0 5 h again and followed by water rinse the resulting membrane was named re coated membrane and labeled as rc nf membrane 2 3 membrane filtration performance the membrane performances were evaluated using a cross flow flat sheet membrane module with effective membrane area of 0 0145 m2 under the condition of transmembrane pressure tmp of 0 5 mpa temperature of 25 c and cross flow velocity of 13 3 cm s before test each membrane was pre pressurized for 1 h to ensure that membrane achieved a steady state a four step protocol was conducted to evaluate the water permeability of membrane figure s1a step 1 the pure water flux jw1 of p nf membrane was examined as a baseline step 2 the p nf membrane was coated by cmcs solution and then the pure water flux jw2 of c nf membrane was tested step 3 the c nf membrane was flushed by decoating reagents for 0 5 h without pressure following with di water rinse for 0 5 h pure water flux jw3 of d nf membrane was measured step 4 the d nf membrane was re coated by cmcs solution for 0 5 h again as step 2 the pure water flux jw4 of the rc nf membrane was recorded the rejections of nacl mgcl2 and na2so4 by p nf c nf d nf and rc nf membrane were also measured nacl mgcl2 and na2so4 solutions at a concentration of 2000 mg l were employed as the feed respectively the water flux and salt rejection were calculated by eq 1 and 2 1 j v a t 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where j l m 2h 1 is the permeate flux v l is the volume of permeation collected in the operation time t h and a m2 is the effective surface area cp mg l and cf mg l represented the salt concentrations in the permeate and feed solution respectively the flux recovery ratio of rc nf frrre can be estimated using the following equation 3 f r r r e j w 4 j w 2 100 frrre is an indicator reflecting the recoating behavior of membrane and is preferable to be nearly 100 2 4 nom fouling on the membrane the fouling propensity of modified membrane was assessed under the total recycle mode of filtration both retentate and permeate were recirculated to the feed reservoir bsa sa and ha were selected to simulate the foulants of nom all of membrane filtration process was operated at tmp of 0 5 mpa temperature of 25 c and the cross flow velocity of 13 3 cm s with nom foulant solution 0 5 g l 5 l for 15 h in fouling testing and 1 h for pure water flux detection the permeate fluxes of p nf and c nf membrane were recorded as illustrated in figure s1b the coating decoating recoating process was applied to mitigate fouling and recover membrane performance after step 1 and 2 as described in section 2 3 the initial water flux of p nf jw1 after compaction and water flux of c nf jw2 were measured the c nf was then filtrated with the feeds containing nom foulants for 15 h to obtain the flux under fouling condition jf after membrane was fouled the membrane was flushed by di water for 10 min to remove the residual foulant solution from the membrane surface and pipelines then the decoating procedure was conducted by the methods described in section 2 2 2 to remove coating layer as well as fouling layer on the membrane and the flux of d nf jw3 was measured finally the d nf membrane was re coated again as the procedure in section 2 2 3 the water flux of rc nf jw4 was recorded the fr r de was calculated to assess decoating efficiency after nom fouling 4 fr r de j w 3 j w 1 100 the fr r re of rc nf was calculated as eq 5 5 fr r re j w 4 j w 2 100 2 5 validity of coating decoating recoating protocol in long term test to evaluate membrane performance in long term test four cycles of nom foulant filtration were carried out for p nf membrane each cycle consisted of two stages filtration with feed containing nom foulants for 72 h and 0 2 hcl flushing for c nf membrane each cycle consisted of three stages filtration with feed containing nom foulants for 72 h 0 2 hcl decoating and cmcs recoating which has been described in section 2 4 for p nf membrane flux recovery ratio frr during four cycle filtration could be obtained using eq 6 6 f r r j d i j 0 100 where j0 is the original pure water flux of the p nf membrane jdi defines the pure water flux of p nf membrane after flushing by hcl solution in i cycle i 1 2 3 for c nf membrane flux recovery ratio frr was expressed through eq 7 7 f r r j r i j 0 100 where j0 is the original pure water flux of the c nf membrane jri is the pure water flux of rc nf membrane after cmcs recoating in i cycle i 1 2 3 3 result and discussion 3 1 effect of coating conditions on the membrane properties the surface morphologies of the p nf and coated membrane were visualized by sem and afm images in fig 1 the p nf membrane presented an appearance of a leaves structure with a rough surface morphology as shown in fig 1 a i after coated by 0 5 wt cmcs solution on the surface the leaves structure has been gradually covered by cmcs layer with the increasing coating time fig 1 a ii a iv the different surface morphology showed that cmcs had completely covered the membrane surface as shown in figure s2 the thickness of coating layer of c0 5t0 5 nf membrane was with an average size of 420 nm with the increasing cmcs concentration and coating time the amount of cmcs as coating layer on membrane surface increased figure s3 for example the toc content of c2t0 5 nf membrane increased about 2 8 times compared with c0 5t0 5 nf membrane as shown in fig 1 a iii v and vi at a constant coating time the coated membrane surface presented a denser coating layer with the increasing concentration the surface of c2t0 5 nf membrane was completely coated by cmcs while underlying nf90 support was not visible besides the coating layer made the surface smoother than the p nf membrane the results were also confirmed by fig 1 b the three dimensional afm images and the values of average roughness ra and root mean squared roughness rms were listed the rms values of p nf c0 5t0 25 nf c0 5t0 5 nf and c0 5t1 nf are 68 4 54 1 42 6 and 43 7 nm respectively the surface smoothness of membranes increased by cmcs coating when the coating time was 1 h the membrane surface got slightly rougher than that of 0 5 h besides the surface roughness of coated membrane increased gradually with the increasing cmcs concentration the increased coating time and concentration would make cmcs agglomerate and thus increased the surface roughness considering the roughness of membrane it was obvious that the surface of nf90 membrane coated by 0 5 wt cmcs for 0 5 h was the smoothest and it could be the most suitable for further studies 3 2 hydrophilicity and pure water flux of cmcs coated membranes the hydrophilicity of p nf and coated membrane was characterized by contact angle ca and pure water flux p nf membrane had the highest ca value which indicated that it was the most hydrophobic one among the membranes tested fig 2 a the coating of 0 5 wt cmcs for 0 25 h on the membrane surface showed ca value of 46 9 the carboxyl hydroxide radical and amino group of cmcs can enhance the hydrophilicity of membrane surface besides cmcs coating reduced the roughness of nf90 membrane which also can improve surface hydrophilicity shahabi et al 2019 the minimum ca was obtained by c0 5t0 5 nf membrane however the ca values increased with the increasing coating concentration which can be attributed to the variation of surface roughness fig 2 b presented the pure water flux of membrane similar to observations of ca an increase in the water flux was recorded from 41 7 lmh to 50 5 lmh as the coating time increased from 0 to 0 5 h the c0 5t0 5 nf membrane exhibited the highest flux the increased flux is mainly ascribed to the smoother and more hydrophilic membrane surface mentioned above cmcs is more hydrophilic for its numerous functional groups causing enhanced adsorption of water molecules on the membrane surface due to the higher intrinsic resistance of nf membrane membrane resistance to water permeation caused by the cmcs layer is negligible akbari et al 2015 sharma et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 however the flux of c0 5t1 nf membrane began to decrease which is owing to the thicker and denser layer by long coating time at the same time the aggregation induced by the high concentration of cmcs can increase mass transfer resistance which resulted in the decrease of flux huang et al 2019 therefore according to the outstanding performance of c0 5t0 5 nf c nf among the membranes it was selected for further research 3 3 characterization of c nf membrane as shown in fig 3 the characteristic peaks on p nf membrane at 1653 cm 1 1492 cm 1 1110cm 1 1153 cm 1 694 cm 1 and 1018 cm 1 were represented amide groups methyl groups aromatic double bonded carbon sulfone groups and ester groups respectively xu and drewes 2006 in the c nf membrane spectra appearance of peaks at 1606 and 1425 cm 1 were attributed to carboxylation of cmcs a strong peak at 1419 cm 1 can be corresponded to the symmetrical stretching vibration of coo group new peaks at 2930 cm 1 and 1054 cm 1 for c h stretch and c o c stretching were observed the peak at 1606 and 1425 cm 1 was attributed to the carboxylation of cmcs the peak of cmcs at 3421 cm 1 confirmed that carboxylation occurred at both primary hydroxyl and amino positions ekambaram and doraisamy 2017 the broad peak around 3400 3200 cm 1 belonged largely to vibration of n h stretching which suggested the cmcs layer coated on the membrane surface via hydrogen bonds it is concluded that the cmcs was successfully coated on nf90 membrane as shown in fig 2 a the ca of p nf membrane was 76 05 after cmcs coated the ca value of c nf membrane significantly decreased to be 25 76 indicating the increase of membrane surface hydrophilicity it is known that a membrane with smooth and hydrophilic surface demonstrates less tendency of fouling the water flux can be favored on c nf membrane the zeta potential values of p nf and c nf membrane at ph 4 to 10 are shown in fig 4 a negative surface charges were observed on both membranes the c nf membrane has a lower density of negative charges than p nf membrane at ph 4 7 this reduction in negative charge is attributed to the appearance of protonated amino group nh3 in cmcs layer panda et al 2015 combined with the result of atr ftir the cmcs layer coated on the membrane was performed by electrostatic adsorption and hydrogen bonding higher values of negative zeta potential on c nf membrane were observed at alkaline conditions corresponding to the deprotonation of carboxyl functional groups of cmcs and the slight hydrolysis of membrane by naoh musale et al 1999 since the organic foulant and microorganism are generally negatively charged lee et al 2009 the negative surface can provide an electrostatic repulsion to improve the anti adhesion efficiency against foulants on the membrane the salt rejection of p nf and c nf membrane was illustrated in fig 4 b c nf membrane exhibited higher salt rejection than p nf membrane rejection of na2so4 mgcl2 and nacl by p nf membrane was 91 89 85 18 and 80 95 while the rejection was 94 56 87 11 and 83 72 respectively by c nf membrane 3 4 assessment of nom fouling on the membranes ha bsa and sa were represented as different nom fractions in natural waters cheng et al 2016 details for test were given in supplementary material s3 the fouling induced by different nom fractions on p nf and c nf membrane were investigated fig 5 a the membrane fouling behaviors differed between different types of foulants for p nf membrane the flux of membrane with ha solution as the feed is higher than that of bsa this may be due to the lower negative charge of bsa resulting in a weaker charge repulsion between the membrane surface and bsa molecules and a higher quantity of attachment on membrane surface bai et al 2020 because of the large number of hydroxyl groups on sa molecular structure it shows strong intermolecular interaction by hydrogen bonding which results in a thicker cake layer on membrane surface therefore the flux curve for sa showed the most severe decline c nf membrane showed a similar trend but better performance comparing with p nf membrane the flux decline trend slowed down significantly and achieved relatively steady state the normalized flux of c nf of ha bsa and sa was maintained at 0 75 0 66 and 0 46 respectively it can be seen that antifouling property of nf membrane was enhanced by coating cmcs negative charge improved hydrophilicity and smoothness of c nf may decrease the nom membrane interaction forces leading to the reduction in adsorption and pores blocking caused by nom on the membrane bai et al 2020 as displayed in fig 5 b the surface of the fouled p nf membrane was fully covered with a dense foulant layer after filtration revealing severe membrane fouling for fouled c nf membrane the fouling layer was rather sparse and parts of the surface morphology of underlying membrane were clear the cmcs layer with hydrophilic and smooth surface can partially prevent the adhesion of foulants from feed water thus provides a protection to membrane surface against the accumulation of membrane foulants results from the selected membrane showed the improved resistance of membrane against nom fouling suggesting that cmcs coating strategy possessed the membrane superior antifouling performance 3 5 effect of decoating reagents on decoating efficiency 3 5 1 effect of decoating reagents on decoating recoating efficiency of c nf membrane the decoating efficiency with different decoating reagents is compared in table s1 the flux of d nf jw3 was compared to the flux of p nf jw1 to evaluate the decoating efficiency the decoating procedure restored the jw3 closer to jw1 indicating the higher decoating efficiency flux recovery ratio of rc nf frrre after decoated by some of the effective decoating reagents were shown in fig 6 the results showed that hcl solution was superior in decoating the cmcs layer as the jw3 after hcl solution flushing was almost completely recovered to jw1 this could indicate that the cmcs layer was almost removed from the membrane surface the 0 02 hcl solution showed the best capacity on decoating cmcs layer the possible mechanisms of decoating of cmcs layer by hcl solution may include i hydrolysis and solubilization kuzmenko et al 2005 and ii the weakened interaction between coating layer and membrane surface since the protonation of nh2 can form nh3 with the decreased ph value the interaction between cmcs and membrane can be easily erased goy et al 2009 shieh et al 2020 besides the hydrogen bonding can also be erased under acidic condition ba et al 2010 this was consistent with sem as showed in fig 7 a iii the surface structure of d nf membrane was restored to the same leaves structure as that of p nf membrane fig 7 a i besides the flux jw4 after recoating step was almost completely restored to jw2 with the best flux recovery as shown in fig 7 b clsm image visualized the distribution of cmcs on d nf and rc nf membrane the cmcs layer was almost completely removed after decoating on d nf membrane while the cmcs was homogeneously coated again on the rc nf membrane nevertheless the high flux of jw3 after decoated by 0 03 hcl solution appeared with the dropped rejection of salt this may be due to the membrane damage or expansion of membrane pores by the removal of adsorbed materials madaeni and samieirad 2010 to evaluate the decoating efficiency of different types of acid decoating reagent with strong acid hcl hno3 weak acid ch3cooh and organic acid c6h8o7 were performed the sem and clsm were also applied for analyzing the decoating results of each chemical reagent as shown in figure s4 and s5 there are still some cmcs molecules coated on membrane after treating with ch3cooh and c6h8o7 the dissolution of cmcs by ch3cooh and c6h8o7 were ineffective the residual cmcs enhanced the local membrane performance thus leading to a higher jw3 than jw1 and the limited decoating efficiency there was an increase in decoating efficiency with the increasing concentration of naoh solution accompanying with the frrre value more than 90 the cooh groups of cmcs molecule form coo due to the deprotonation of the carboxyl which will weaken the hydrogen bonding zhao et al 2003 besides the increased negative charge leads to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and cmcs layer such interaction forces can promote the detachment of cmcs from membrane surface the decoating efficiency with sds solution was quite poor the cmcs layer was not easily erased by 5 mm sds solution this is attributed to the lower sds concentration than the critical micelle concentration about 8 3 mm in di water ang et al 2006 the sds concentration with 10 mm had a better decoating efficiency the cleaning mechanism is known as the transport of foulants from the membrane to the bulk solution by forming sds micelles around them li and elimelech 2004 sds molecule has amphiphilic structure which can reduce the interfacial tension of adjacent molecules madaeni and samieirad 2010 with the concentration increased to 20 mm the jw3 showed much higher than jw1 probably because of an amount of sds retained on membrane which enhanced membrane hydrophilicity among the decoating reagents tested the hcl solution was most efficient in cmcs layer decoating after decoating procedure the protective layer was completely re coated and maintained excellent membrane performance referring to the decoating efficiency of the coating layer hcl solution naoh solution and sds solution were selected for evaluation the decoating efficiency of nom fouled membrane 3 5 2 feasibility of coating decoating recoating for nom fouling mitigation to mitigate nom fouling on the membrane the decoating reagents including 0 2 hcl solution 4 mm naoh solution and 10 mm sds solution were tested as membrane cleaning detergents flux and flux recovery ratio were shown in table 2 while bsa fouled membranes were visualized by clms to demonstrate fouling mitigation in fig 8 as for p nf membrane naoh solution flushing was the most efficient way to remove nom fouling layer and provided the highest fr r de than acid and sds flushing for example the fr r de achieved to 85 7 after naoh flushing the bsa fouled membrane table 2 as reported in previous research the protein fouling was mainly related to the formation of hydrophobic cake layer beyer et al 2010 the increasing ph effectively induced the dissolution of protein from membrane surface this result agreed well with the clsm image fig 8 b iv some of the bsa layer deposited on pristine membrane was removal however the results showed that the fr r de after treatment by sds solution for nom fouled membrane was poor hydrophobic tail of sds could not successfully adhere to the membrane surface owing to the repulsive electrostatic force between the negatively charged surfactant and negatively charged membrane surface as for hcl solution it could not effectively dissolve and completely remove the nom on p nf membrane the fr r de of nom fouled p nf membranes flushed by hcl solution were low in the case of nom fouled c nf membrane the coating layer reduced the accumulation of bsa fig 8 a vii and 8b vii the presence of cmcs coating increased the fr r de of naoh and the restored flux after recoating was higher than 90 as shown in fig 8 b ix the foulants and cmcs layer on surface of c nf membrane after naoh decoating decreased however the nom fouled c nf membrane decoated by sds solution appeared to be not effective after flushing by sds solution most cmcs coating layer still remained on membrane and the removal of bsa foulant layer is also incomplete fig 8 b x the hcl decoating showed excellent efficiency which was the same with the decoating efficiency mentioned above the water flux after flushed by 0 2 hcl solution jw3 restored to the original flux of p nf membrane indicating acid solution successfully peel off the coating layer along with membrane nom foulants for decoating each nom foulant c nf membrane the fr r de was higher than 98 5 as shown in fig 8 a viii after treatment with 0 2 hcl membrane the d nf membrane presented clean with almost no residue besides clsm image in fig 8 b viii also verified that almost no bsa and cmcs was observed on d nf membrane surface the morphology structure exhibited similar to a fresh one thus owing to the property of cmcs under different ph the coating layer possesses the membrane with decoating performance both fouling layer and coating layer can be facilely detached to maximally refresh the membrane surface subsequently a new cmcs layer was re coated on the recovered nf90 membrane to achieve membrane reuse the fr r re of rc nf membrane after decoated by hcl solution exhibited at least 98 demonstrating the excellent flux recovery property of the regeneration layer in summary hcl solution as decoating reagent can efficiently remove cmcs coating layer and nom fouling layer simultaneously in a synergistic manner the cmcs layer acts as a sacrificial layer to protect the underlying nf membrane after facile recoating process a new cmcs layer could be re coated on the membrane possessing a sustainable antifouling protection for nf membrane to further explore the recoating performance of the cmcs coating layer p nf and c nf membrane were fouled by nom foulants and decoated by 0 2 hcl solution for four cycles as depicted in fig 9 the recoating treatment could significantly recover the membrane flux after each decoating process the change of initial flux and flux pattern of rc nf membrane was minor between the cycles while the significant decline of flux was observed from p nf membrane as fouling cycles increasing from 1 to 4 c nf membrane remained high flux recovery with more than 95 5 at each cycle the results indicate that this strategy can endow the membrane with excellent recoating capacity and regenerate membrane performance 3 6 performance of coating decoating recoating strategy in long term process to further explore the strategy of coating decoating recoating in long term process the time dependent fluxes under nom fouling condition and corresponding frr for four cycles of 72 h filtration test were depicted in fig 10 the fluxes of p nf membrane were sharply declined with the increasing filtration cycle while the fluxes of c nf membrane were relatively steady in long term process for 12 days in comparison c nf membrane exhibited higher frr at each fouling cycle at the fourth period the frr value of p nf membrane of ha bsa and sa was only 27 89 23 81 and 12 6 respectively whereas for the c nf membrane the frr was 91 51 90 32 and 88 82 respectively it can be observed that the flux loss and flux recovery occurred for the p nf membrane was severe implying the serious irreversible membrane fouling even though the membrane cleaning was applied at the end of each cycle owing to the coating layer of c nf membrane the underlying membrane was protected with extremely low fouling during the long term filtration the water permeability of the rc nf membrane was relatively consistent ensuring coating decoating recoating performance was less affected by the long term fouling cycles 4 implications the present study provides a strategy of coating decoating recoating to eliminate nom fouling from nf membrane in water applications firstly a sacrificial protective layer can be coated on the membrane surface by a green and natural polymeric material i e cmcs the facile coating method results in a visible layer on membrane surface enhancing the mitigation of nom fouling the selection of coating polymer can be various but the natural and low cost polymers with favorable properties are preferred secondly the protective layer is sacrificial and can be easily decoated to achieve effective removal of nom fouling and recovering the original membrane performance since cmcs is nontoxic and biodegradable and it has promising applications in medical and food industries the potential risk of health and environment caused by decoated materials are negligible thirdly new cmcs layer is re coated on membrane surface again in situ to restore membrane performance with sacrificial protective layer considering the reuse of the recoating solution it is possible to maintain the constant cmcs concentration in the recoating solution or manipulate coating time to reach optimal coating performance rather than replacing the recoating solution after each cycle although the present study is based on flat sheet nf membrane in the plate and frame module the method can also be applicable for different membranes such as ro forward osmosis different membrane modules such as spiral wound and hollow fiber as well as different fouling such as inorganic scaling organic fouling biofouling this coating decoating recoating strategy is a promising method to promote antifouling property and sustainable reusability of membrane in practical applications in addition the coating decoating recoating strategy described in the present study is substrate independent and it is also applicable on various types of surfaces e g membrane spacer cooling tower which suffer from fouling issue 5 conclusions in this study a novel strategy namely coating decoating recoating was performed on nf membranes to promote its antifouling property the major conclusions were discovered as follows 1 cmcs coated membrane was fabricated via simple coating operation the coating layer has no negative effect on membrane intrinsic properties but improvement of permeability and antifouling performances 2 super clearance of nom fouling layer on the coated membrane was reached by decoating cmcs layer from the membrane surface the coated cmcs worked as a sacrificial layer to protect underlying nf membrane 3 regeneration of cmcs layer on the membrane could be easily reached by repeating coating procedure the membrane performances were maximally recovered after recoating procedure furthermore the simple coating decoating recoating procedure allowed the modification of membrane in situ 4 both short term and long term nom fouling tests showed that the coating decoating recoating strategy was feasible and maintained high flux recovery ratio during nf process 5 by selecting natural and low cost coating materials e g cmcs the coating decoating recoating strategy has a great potential to be a green economic and sustainable method for membrane antifouling in practical applications for water treatment author contributions

15917,the international campaign to ban bisphenol a bpa has resulted in increasing application of bpa substitutes however investigations have mainly been confined to the removal of single contaminant from the water resulting in an inefficient burden furthermore systematic study and synthetical discussion of bisphenol analogues bps kinetics and transformation pathways were largely underemphasized chemical oxidation of bpa and four typical alternatives i e bisphenol af bisphenol e bisphenol f and bisphenol s in a uv activated persulfate system was examined in this study the effects of persulfate ps dosage ph and water matrix constituents i e bicarbonate chloride and natural organic matter were comprehensively examined using a combination of laboratory experiments and mathematical modeling according to our findings the removal characteristics of different bps employing so4 induced removal technology including degradation mechanisms and influencing trends by water matrix revealed similarly the second order rate constants of so4 reacting with bps served as the main variables mediating the variation in degradation kinetics frontier molecular orbital theory and density functional theory suggested bps molecules possessed the same susceptible positions to free radicals in the uv activated ps process transformation pathways included hydroxylation electron transfer substitution and rearrangement triggered by ortho cleavage with certain intermediates exhibiting higher toxicity than the parent chemicals the findings of this study provided valuable information to estimate potential environmental risks of using bpa alternatives graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords bisphenol analogues density functional theory steady state kinetic model toxity assessment transformation pathway 1 introduction bisphenol analogues bps have been extensively used in a variety of commercial and industrial products since 1950s because of their unique chemical and physical properties such as low vapor pressure and volatility table 1 tsai 2006 specifically bisphenol a bpa was commonly employed as a monomer in the manufacturing of epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics for various daily necessities including food storage containers lacquers plastics tableware and water pipes noszczynska and piotrowska seget 2018 however more recently scientific and public concerns have been raised about the manufactures and applications of bpa as bpa could leach from products into food and water causing negative environmental impacts and endocrine disruption huang et al 2020 the use of bpa in the manufacturing of infant feeding bottles has been outlawed in a number of nations and regions including european union united states and china wang et al 2017 in france bpa is even forbidden in food packaging and beverage cans noszczynska and piotrowska seget 2018 thus bpa alternatives have been introduced to reconcile the tensions between surged consumption and severe bpa prohibition bisphenol af bpaf bisphenol e bpe bisphenol f bpf and bisphenol s bps were previously considered to be acceptable bpa substitutes because to their excellent thermostability and photostability wang et al 2017 with increased replacement these bpa alternatives have been broadly detected in natural aquatic environments and engineering water systems for example bpaf was found in surface water up to 15 3 ng l 1 lei et al 2019a wang et al 2019b groundwater 0 02 2 4 ng l 1 noszczynska and piotrowska seget 2018 raw municipal wastewater 4 2 12 6 ng l 1 and biological treated municipal wastewater 1 1 13 2 ng l 1 sun et al 2017 bpe concentrations in the influent and effluent of municipal wastewater treatment were observed to be 2 8 97 6 ng l 1 and 8 1 75 2 ng l 1 respectively li et al 2018 sun et al 2017 bpf occurred in surface water 26 720 ng l 1 liu et al 2017 as well as wastewater influent 27 4 104 ng l 1 and effluent 0 6 35 4 ng l 1 sun et al 2017 bps was identified in surface water 4 1 160 ng l 1 liu et al 2017 and wastewater influent 34 4 86 1 ng l 1 and effluent 2 18 74 2 ng l 1 liu et al 2017 furthermore bpaf and bps concentrations in polycarbonate bottled water might reach 4 9 ng l 1 and 10 6 ng l 1 respectively wang et al 2020 recent investigations have revealed that bpa alternatives could exhibit physiological damage luo et al 2020 wang et al 2006 underscoring the critical need for more extensive research on bpa and its analogues bpa alternatives can be more resistant to biological degradation than bpa itself yang et al 2019 within 28 days the anaerobic process had little effect on bps or bpaf degradation luo et al 2020 the half life of bpaf in an aerobic sludge process was estimated to be 22 36 days which is much longer than that of 1 day for bpa luo et al 2020 the average removal efficiency for bpa bpe and bpaf at a standard municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp was 69 3 19 5 and 52 5 respectively wang et al 2019a the negative values of bpe and bpaf were probably attributed to their robust structure absence of degrading bacteria and the release from the conjugate forms implying that bpe and bpaf were recalcitrant and could not be effectively removed in current municipal wastewater treatment processes madrid and zayas 2007 rodayan et al 2014 sun et al 2017 previous studies showed that sulfate radical so4 2 5 3 1 v induced advanced oxidation processes sr aops are efficient options for the elimination of refractory organic pollutants in wastewater treatment wang and wang 2018 the freely diffusible so4 has a longer lifetime and allows for excellent mass transfer and contact with the target contaminant wacławek et al 2017 generally so4 can be yielded from activation of persulfate ps by heat light transition metal or electrochemical methods gu et al 2019 matzek and carter 2016 zhang et al 2015 of these options uv light has been widely used in drinking water treatment without producing secondary pollution in the environmental as a result the uv activated persulfate uv ps system could be a promising candidate for removing bpa and its analogues from the aquatic environment however previous investigations focused solely on the removal of a single bpa contaminant according to recent research bps degradation possessed a similarity in terms of physicochemical properties transformation performance and physiological toxicity with bpa which can be ascribed to the existence of bi p hydroxyphenyl structure luo et al 2020 thus we hypothesize in this work that the degradation characteristics of different bps using so4 induced removal technology including degradation mechanisms and influencing trends by water matrix revealed similarly a generalized model was designed and developed on the basis of this assumption this model can be regarded as a core and basis of kinetic analysis to predict the decomposition efficiency of various bps to quantify the steady state concentrations of ros and to examine the impacts of various solution chemistry conditions and water matrix constituents second order rate constants of so4 reacting with bps were employed as significant independent variables in the model this study aims to assess the generality and diversity on the kinetics toxicity and dft studies of sulfate radical induced transformation of five bps i e bpa bpaf bpe bpf and bps using a generalized kinetic model differentiation analysis on reaction dynamics and degradation pathways for various bps removal was conducted and summarized as the system model in the so4 mediated oxidation process transformation products and vulnerable positions of bps molecules were determined according to frontier molecular orbital theory and density functional theory the acute toxicity of parent compounds and intermediates after uv ps oxidation was also assessed to our best knowledge this will be the first comprehensive study on so4 induced transformation of bpa analogues which would benefit to evaluate the substitutability and potential risks of bpa and its alternatives 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals bisphenol a bpa 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl

conducted in a bench scale uv irradiator equipped with a low pressure mercury uv lamp 254 nm gph212t5l 4 haraeus noblelight placing in the center of a 250 ml cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor a

actinometry rahn et al 2007 see text s1 for details in order to stabilize the uv irradiation the uv lamp was warmed up 30 min prior to the treatment the temperature was maintained at 25 0 1 c a phosphate buffer 10 mm was used to keep the ph between 4 5 9 5 unless otherwise stated the initial concentrations of bps and ps were 12 μm and 0 8 mm respectively at designated time intervals 1 5 ml samples were withdrawn and immediately quenched with 0 1 ml sodium thiosulfate 0 5 m each experiment was conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods concentrations of bpa bpaf bpe bpf and bps in the aqueous phase were measured by using high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters e2695 usa equipped with a waters c18 reversed phase column 5 μm 150 4 6 mm and a 2489 uv detector at uv wavelengths of 276 270 280 230 and 262 nm respectively the mobile phases of meoh and 0 1 formic acid v v 30 70 were employed to separate bps within 7 min 1 0 ml min and the column temperature was maintained at 35 c chemical oxidation intermediates of bps were identified by a high resolution mass hrms using q exactive hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer thermo scientific usa analytes

negative mode electrospray ionization esi were used with mass spectra ranging from 50 to 500 m z to identify the optimal molecular structures of bps with the minimum energy and elucidate the reaction

mutagenicity yang et al 2020 2 4 kinetic model and predictions photolysis of ps results in the formation of so4 which subsequently converts to ho via a ph dependent redox reaction between h2o oh and so4 reactions 1 3 in table 2 the dominant reactive radical at ph 9 is so4 and oh progressively becomes the major reactive radical at ph 9 choi and chung 2019 hua et al 2019 table 2 summarized the possible reactions in uv ps systems as well as their rate constants the decontamination process of bps in the uv activated ps system was predicted using a pseudo steady state model it is assumed that reactive oxygen species ros such as so4 and ho generated by ps photolysis were responsible for bps removal and their concentrations remained at a steady state fang et al 2014 fu et al 2019 the steady state concentrations of so4 and ho were calculated to be a ratio of ros formation rate to its consumption rate as follows see more details in text s3 1 d b p s d t b p s k 8 s o 4 s s k 9 h o s s k 0

the total pseudo first order rate constant of radicals to bps degradation in uv ps process 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of reaction rate constants of bps degradation the removal performance of bps was evaluated under three conditions including uv photolysis alone ps oxidation alone in the dark and a combination of uv ps the results showed that bpa bpaf bpe and bpf were completely degraded in the uv ps process within 30 min while their mitigations in the direct uv photolysis less than 3 or dark ps oxidation less than 1 were all insignificant fig 1 a thus the uv efficiently activated ps to destruct these bps however bps degradation was resistant to the uv ps process with about half of the bps remaining after 30 min indicating that its degradation kinetic was distinct from these of bpa to shed light on the ros effect on bps removal we further carried out scavenging tests in the uv ps process in brief methanol meoh was used as a probe compound for the total flux of so4 kso4 meoh 3 2 106 m 1s 1 and oh koh meoh 9 7 106 m 1s 1 xie et al 2015 and tert butanol tba was used as a specific scavenger for oh koh tba 3 2 7 6 108 m 1s 1 but not so4 kso4 tba 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 malathi et al 2017 priya et al 2018 the addition of meoh significantly inhibited bps degradation whereas that of tba was ineffective fig 1b the results demonstrated that so4 rather than ho played a principal role in bps decomposition to distinguish the reactivity of bps towards so4 and ho kinetic competition tests were conducted using benzoic acid ba as the probe compound kba so4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 and kba ho 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 in the uv ps and uv h2o2 systems respectively vogna et al 2004 in uv h2o2 process h2o2 could be homogeneously cleaved by uv activation generating highly oxygen reactive species to attack organic molecules in which oh plays the significant role lee et al 2021 10 mm tba was added to quench ho in the uv ps system enabling so4 as the major oxidant the second order rate constants of bps with so4 k8 in table 2 were calculated using eq 7 as follow 7 l n b p s 0 b p s t k b p s u v k b p s p s k 8 k b a s o 4 l n b a 0 b a t k b a u v k b a p s where kbps uv and kba uv are the pseudo first order rate constants s 1 of the bps and ba by uv direct irradiation respectively kbps ps and kba ps represent the pseudo first order rate constants s 1 of the bps and ba by ps direct oxidation respectively regression analysis showed linear association between l n b p s 0 b p s t k b p s u v k b p s p s and l n b a 0 b a t k b a u v k b a p s r 2 0 99 fig 1c as a result at ph 7 5 the second order rate constants of so4 reacting with bpa bpaf bpe bpf and bps i e k8 in table 2 were calculated to be 1 85 109 1 54 109 1 18 109 4 31 108 and 1 09 108 m 1 s 1 respectively in the same manner at ph 7 5 the second order rate constants of ho reacting with bpa bpaf bpe bpf and bps i e k9 in table 2 were estimated to be 2 40 109 2 34 109 3 17 109 1 73 109 and 5 17 108 m 1 s 1 respectively fig 1d the second order rate constants for bps degradation with so4 were slightly lower than those with ho the difference could be due to the selectivity of so4 or various bridging atom and groups of bps structure 3 2 comparative kinetic analyses on bps degradation degradation of the five selected bps was evaluated in the uv ps system under different conditions of persulfate dosages 0 2 1 2 mm reaction ph 4 5 9 5 bicarbonate 0 10 mm chloride 0 10 mm and nom 0 3 mg l 1 concentrations the pseudo first order rate constants kobs were theoretically predicted and experimentally estimated and compared among these bps the obtained kobs values of bpaf against these reaction conditions are illustrated in figs 2 a e and those of other bps are detailed in figs s2 s8 the effect of different persulfate dosages on bpaf degradation kinetics is presented in fig 2a the kobs value was estimated to be 2 26 0 25 10 4 s 1 at a ps dosage of 0 2 mm and linearly increased to 2 70 0 74 10 3 s 1 with the dosage increasing to 1 2 mm showing a relative increase of 12 times the result is consistent with previous observations on the degradation kinetics of amaranth dye as higher ps dosage can produce more abundant ros lin et al 2017 the estimated kobs values for bpa bpe and bpf were nearly comparable to bpaf fig s2 however the kobs value of bps only increased 3 times with increasing ps dosage likely because bps had lower reactivity with so4 and ho the kinetic prediction results i e kcal obs well agreed with the measured data fig 2a indicating the validity of the model table s1 according to the modeling analysis the effects of different ros i e so4 and ho on bps degradation were derived the kcal so4 gradually increased as the ps dose was raised whereas kcal ho was almost neglectable this further demonstrates that so4 rather than ho contributes to bps degradation in the uv ps system the reaction ph has a significant effect on the removal of organic contaminants in the uv ps system in previous reports the ph effect was controversial luo et al 2016 herein we investigated the effect of ph ranging from 4 5 to 9 5 on degradation kinetics of bps the results showed that the kobs values of bps reduced by 32 55 when the ph increased fig 2b and fig s3 this indicates that an acidic environment favors the degradation of organic compounds by uv ps consistent to luo et al luo et al 2016 on the one hand despite the fact that the generation of secondary radicals i e hpo4 were proved to be derived from the reaction between phosphate buffer and ros in the uv ps process the modeling results kcal obs well fit the experimental data without taking hpo4 into account this thereby implies an insignificant role of hpo4 in bps removal on the other hand there was limited contribution from the physicochemical properties of oxidant e g molar absorption coefficient and the quantum efficiency of photo dissociation of ps in bps degradation yu et al 2004 as shown in fig s4 ps self dissociation was identical between ph 4 5 9 5 consequently the generation of so4 in the uv ps process was not affected by ph nevertheless raising the ph from 4 5 to 9 5 reduced the steady state concentrations of so4 during bps degradation by 55 60 table s1 on the basis of the reactions 11 12 in table 2 the calculation of kinetic model showed that the overall quenching capacity of phosphate k11 h2po4 k12 hpo4 2 increased from 7 40 102 s 1 to 1 19 104 s 1 when the ph climbed from 4 5 to 9 5 therefore the varying quenching magnitude and the weakened removal efficiency in uv ps process are induced by the scavenging effects of h2po4 and hpo4 2 wang and wang 2020 xu and wang 2012 inorganic ions e g hco3 and cl and natural organic matter nom are ubiquitous in natural water bodies and have been shown to affect the decontamination efficiency in sr aops wang and wang 2021a generally hco3 can react with so4 and ho at the rate constants around 106 m 1s 1 according to reactions 16 and 17 in table 2 pereira et al 2007 cl is also commonly considered as a radical scavenger to suppress the removal process of organic contaminants reactions 20 and 21 in table 2 hou et al 2018 hence the hco3 and cl effects were integrated into the bps degradation model as illustrated in fig 2c and fig s5 the experimental results revealed that in the presence of 10 mm hco3 kobs for bps degradation dropped to 30 50 the estimated steady state concentrations of so4 and ho reduced dramatically to 15 38 whereas co3 became three orders of magnitude higher than that of so4 table s1 the negative impact of hco3 could be associated with the transformation of so4 and ho to co3 via electron transfer as known co3 act as a selective chemical oxidant e0 1 78 v at ph 7 for the degradation of organic pollutants with the second order rate constants ranging within 10 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 however the measured kobs agreed with the predicted kcal obs by the model that excluded co3 this thereby suggests an insignificant role of co3 for bps degradation the kobs values of bps degradation decreased by 10 43 in the presence of 1 mm cl concentration and then maintained stable after raising cl to 10 mm fig 2d and fig s6 this was likely ascribed to the transformation of reactive so4 and ho to less reactive chlorine ros grebel et al 2010 the kinetic model prediction showed that the presence of 1 mm cl substantially reduced the steady state so4 concentration by four orders of magnitude while increasing the ho concentration by one order of magnitude the higher regeneration rate of ho than so4 was achieved reactions 29 in table 2 indicating ho served as the dominant radical in the uv ps chloride system for the removal of bps it is to be noted that the modelled kcal obs values were slightly lower than the measured kobs in the so4 mediated decontamination technology secondary radicals e g cl cl2 and cloh are the predominant radical species in the presence of cl reactions 18 29 in table 2 the second order rate constants of cl and cl2 reacting with bpa at ph 7 5 were determined to be 1 82 1010 and 5 82 108 m 1 s 1 respectively in previous investigations lei et al 2019b other bps may perform similar reactivity to chloride radicals at 106 1010 m 1 s 1 level due to the presence of bi p hydroxyphenyl structure furthermore according to the calculations of the kinetic model the steady state concentrations of cl cl2 and cloh increased from 0 to 2 04 0 52 10 20 s 1 8 4 3 8 10 10 s 1 and 1 46 0 14 10 12 s 1 respectively with the cl concentration rising from 0 to 10 mm these results indicate that secondary chlorine radicals are critical in the uv ps system for bps degradation tan et al 2017 wang et al 2015 bps degradation kinetics were assessed at ph 7 5 with a nom of 0 3 mg l 1 and the results are shown in fig 2e and fig s7 the kobs values of bps degradation fell by 20 41 in the presence of 3 mg l 1 nom of note nom could inhibit the bps degradation through different routes on the one hand nom competed with organic contaminants for so4 and ho at rate constants of 2 50 104 mg l 1 s 1 and 1 30 104 mg l 1 s 1 respectively as reactions 30 and 31 in table 2 xie et al 2015 when nom reached 3 mg l 1 the calculated steady state concentrations of so4 and ho dropped by more than one order of magnitude table s1 on the other hand nom act as an inner filter of uv transmittance at 254 nm to suppress the bps photolysis and so4 production with the absorption coefficient of 3 15 l m 1 mg 1 εnom luo et al 2016 to quantify the respective contribution of the radical quenching and inner filter effects to bps degradation two kinetic models were established with the assumption of εnom 0 or that the rate constants of reactions between nom and ros were zero k30 k31 0 in table 2 as illustrated in fig 2e and fig s8 the kobs well fitted the modelled results of assuming k30 k31 0 rather than εnom 0 therefore quenching was identified to be the key factor affecting bps degradation summing up the above results fig 2f reflected the fluctuation and amplitude of kobs induced by various factors statistical differences between bpa and its analogues were accessed by one way analysis of variance using the tukey post hoc test p values below 0 05 were considered significant the removal of bpaf and bpe in the uv ps system had insignificant differences p 0 05 with bpa in contrast the difference between bpf bps and bpa was significant p 0 001 by employing the second order rate constants of so4 and ho reacting with bps as independent variables in pseudo steady state model all results obtained from the model predictions were in accord with the experimental results it can therefore be concluded that the difference of degradation kinetics among these bps is ascribed to the diverse reaction activity of ros 3 3 generality and diversity on bps transformation pathways the aforementioned experimental and model data clearly demonstrated that the bps was principally degraded by so4 generated in the uv ps process to clarify the underlying transformation mechanisms we attempted to determine the vulnerable sites of the bp molecular structures towards so4 the frontier molecular orbital theory mo the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo were adopted to predict the highest active positions during the oxidation reactions in which the sites with higher fed2 lumo fed2 homo values were regarded as the atomic free radical attack positions ji et al 2013 wahab et al 2009 as depicted in fig 3 the homos of bpa bpaf bpe bpf and bps were estimated to be 0 206 0 225 0 206 0 207 and 0 234 ev respectively and the lumos as 0 002 0 016 0 001 0 003 and 0 037 ev respectively this reveals electron flows at different sites as for homo π bonding orbitals were observed on the phenolic structure for the lumo π antibonding orbitals occurred on the benzene ring accompanied by the torsional deformation to the bridging atom between two phenol groups as summarized in tables s2 s6 the negative charge was concentrated on the o atom of the phenolic hydroxyl group and the ortho position c atom of the benzene ring the ortho position c atoms served as active sites for oxidation reactions with the highest density of fed2 homo fed2 lumo specifically the meta position c atoms of the benzene ring in the bpe molecule and the para position c atoms of the phenol on the molecular structure of bps were also subject to the free radical attack with higher values of fed2 homo fed2 lumo on the basis of the density functional theory dft the fukui indexes including radical attack f a 0 electrophilic attack f a 1 and nucleophilic attack f a 1 for various bps were adopted to forecast the attacking locations on bps molecules as summarized in tables s7 s11 the ortho position c atoms of the benzene ring was the highest active position for the oxidative destruction by ros with the highest fa 0 value ascribed to the presence of similar bi p hydroxyphenyl structures and active sites degradation characteristics i e removal mechanisms and influencing trends by water matrix of bps in the uv ps process inclined to be identical as illustrated in the representative chromatograms fig s9 s13 tentative oxidation intermediates of bps were identified table s12 during uv ps treatment the proposed plausible transformation pathways of bpa bpaf bpe bpf and bps were shown in figs 4 in short prevalent degradation reactions include hydroxylation electron transfer substitution and rearrangement as below initially radical cations r2 were generated via electron transfer then monohydroxylated bps r4 and dehydroxylated bps r5 were produced due to the susceptibility of ortho position c atoms of r2 1c and 5c sites in fig 4 to ros pathway 1 in fig 4 sharma et al 2015 sharma et al 2016 besides hydroxylation adducts r4 and r5 could be generated via hydroxylation reactions or oxygen transfer reactions li et al 2018 torres et al 2008 the above results showed that ho was a minor contributor to bps degradation the ho presented specific selectivity to six membered heterocyclic compounds and thereby resulting in additional reactions pathway 2 in fig 4 poerschmann et al 2010 the precursors of the hydroxylation adducts r4 and r5 including phenoxy radicals r6 and other resonance intermediates r7 and r8 were produced on the account of the delocalization of an electron yang et al 2019 subsequently ros preferentially attacked the ortho position of the phenol moiety 1c and 5c sites according to the mo and dft calculations leading to the formation of r4 and r5 pathway 3 in fig 4 following that the generated hydroxylation adducts r4 and r5 could be oxidized by ortho cleavage and produced ring opening products such as a b and c despite the absence of these similar parallel intermediates the degradation of bpaf and bps produced other ring opening products after hydroxylation with ortho cleavage and para cleavage k in fig s10 and l m in fig s13 which agrees with the results of fed2 homo fed2 lumo the ring cleavage intermediates were oxidized by ros and reconstituted with a hydroxylated benzene ring resulting in the formation of i and j the generated radicals r8 in pathway 3 could further produce cations r9 and secondary radicals r10 via the β scission route pathway 3 in fig 4 walling and padwa 1963 these compounds shifted to x y bond cleavage intermediates f and phenol g most of the aromatic products identified in this study could be further transformed into low molecular weight intermediates through ring opening reactions and finally mineralized into co2 and h2o 3 4 toxicity assessment of the products from bps degradation toxicity estimation software tool t e s t software was used to assess the acute toxicity of various bps and their intermediates by determining the lethal concentration of 50 fathead minnow lc50 96 h and oral rat ld50 wang and wang 2021b in several recent studies the offspring of mice exposed to bpa exhibited inherited changes in dna expression as well as aberrant immune system harris et al 2018 hence bioaccumulation was considered in the toxicity assessment in this work although bpa analogues were previously considered to be relatively safe this study shows that bpaf and bpe exhibited more toxic than bpa as shown in fig 5 and table s13 fathead minnow lc50 96 h estimated for bpaf and bpe were 1 96 and 2 08 mg l 1 respectively both of which are below that of bpa 3 01 mg l 1 the oral rat ld50 96 h estimated for bpa 3196 23 mg kg 1 was also substantially higher than that for bpaf 306 91 mg kg 1 this indicates that bpaf shows moderately toxic according to the hodge and sterner toxicity classification scale therefore the replacement of bpa with some analogues such as bpaf and bpe would be expected to result in potential environmental problems it should be urgent to establish effective treatment processes to mitigate bps in water matrixes moreover some tentative intermediates generated from bps degradation even possessed higher developmental toxicity than the parent compounds for example the proposed intermediates e h i and j in fig 4 tended to exhibit higher toxicity than the original bps based on the results of the fathead minnow lc50 96 h and developmental toxicity value the proposed intermediate g in fig 4 was classified as moderate risk based on the results of the oral rat ld50 96 h these undesirable byproducts would induce abnormal development in humans and animals nevertheless because of the low concentrations of intermediates their overall toxicity following uv ps treatment remains unclear and more research is needed furthermore based on the above comparative kinetic analyses on bps degradation realistic wastewater with varying ph bicarbonate chloride and nom concentrations would induce a variety of degradation kinetics and transformation pathways necessitating additional attention to the generation of novel intermediates formed by secondary radicals e g cl cl2 and co3 toxicity is a function of the treated water the presence of various constituents and their concentrations but this was not taken into account in this study which has to be looked into further 4 conclusions this study contributed to a better knowledge of the kinetic patterns transformation mechanism and toxicity variation of bpa and its analogues in a uv activated ps treatment process main conclusions include degradation characteristics i e removal mechanisms and influencing trends by water matrix of bps using so4 mediated decontamination technology inclined to be identical the generalized pseudo steady state model in which second order rate constants of so4 reacting with bps are a series of critical constraints to mediate the difference on degradation kinetics can estimate the oxidation efficiency of a range of bps in the uv ps system quickly and accurately the bps degradation rate was ph dependent due to varied scavenging effect of phosphate at different ph hco3 and cl had negative influences on kobs because so4 and ho were transformed into less reactive intermediate radical species inhibiting effect of nom on the bps degradation is attributed to the radical quenching effect and inner filter effect of which the former played a dominant role as for the molecular structure of bps the ortho position c atoms on the benzene ring and the o atom of the phenolic hydroxyl group served as susceptible sites for so4 and ho assaults according to the tentative degradation intermediates theoretical calculation and literature the transformation pathways of bps were further proposed which included hydroxylation electron transfer substitution and rearrangement driven by ortho cleavage in the uv activated ps process of note bpaf and bpe exhibited more toxic than bpa and some transformation intermediates had higher toxicity than the parent chemicals declaration of

15917,the international campaign to ban bisphenol a bpa has resulted in increasing application of bpa substitutes however investigations have mainly been confined to the removal of single contaminant from the water resulting in an inefficient burden furthermore systematic study and synthetical discussion of bisphenol analogues bps kinetics and transformation pathways were largely underemphasized chemical oxidation of bpa and four typical alternatives i e bisphenol af bisphenol e bisphenol f and bisphenol s in a uv activated persulfate system was examined in this study the effects of persulfate ps dosage ph and water matrix constituents i e bicarbonate chloride and natural organic matter were comprehensively examined using a combination of laboratory experiments and mathematical modeling according to our findings the removal characteristics of different bps employing so4 induced removal technology including degradation mechanisms and influencing trends by water matrix revealed similarly the second order rate constants of so4 reacting with bps served as the main variables mediating the variation in degradation kinetics frontier molecular orbital theory and density functional theory suggested bps molecules possessed the same susceptible positions to free radicals in the uv activated ps process transformation pathways included hydroxylation electron transfer substitution and rearrangement triggered by ortho cleavage with certain intermediates exhibiting higher toxicity than the parent chemicals the findings of this study provided valuable information to estimate potential environmental risks of using bpa alternatives graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords bisphenol analogues density functional theory steady state kinetic model toxity assessment transformation pathway 1 introduction bisphenol analogues bps have been extensively used in a variety of commercial and industrial products since 1950s because of their unique chemical and physical properties such as low vapor pressure and volatility table 1 tsai 2006 specifically bisphenol a bpa was commonly employed as a monomer in the manufacturing of epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics for various daily necessities including food storage containers lacquers plastics tableware and water pipes noszczynska and piotrowska seget 2018 however more recently scientific and public concerns have been raised about the manufactures and applications of bpa as bpa could leach from products into food and water causing negative environmental impacts and endocrine disruption huang et al 2020 the use of bpa in the manufacturing of infant feeding bottles has been outlawed in a number of nations and regions including european union united states and china wang et al 2017 in france bpa is even forbidden in food packaging and beverage cans noszczynska and piotrowska seget 2018 thus bpa alternatives have been introduced to reconcile the tensions between surged consumption and severe bpa prohibition bisphenol af bpaf bisphenol e bpe bisphenol f bpf and bisphenol s bps were previously considered to be acceptable bpa substitutes because to their excellent thermostability and photostability wang et al 2017 with increased replacement these bpa alternatives have been broadly detected in natural aquatic environments and engineering water systems for example bpaf was found in surface water up to 15 3 ng l 1 lei et al 2019a wang et al 2019b groundwater 0 02 2 4 ng l 1 noszczynska and piotrowska seget 2018 raw municipal wastewater 4 2 12 6 ng l 1 and biological treated municipal wastewater 1 1 13 2 ng l 1 sun et al 2017 bpe concentrations in the influent and effluent of municipal wastewater treatment were observed to be 2 8 97 6 ng l 1 and 8 1 75 2 ng l 1 respectively li et al 2018 sun et al 2017 bpf occurred in surface water 26 720 ng l 1 liu et al 2017 as well as wastewater influent 27 4 104 ng l 1 and effluent 0 6 35 4 ng l 1 sun et al 2017 bps was identified in surface water 4 1 160 ng l 1 liu et al 2017 and wastewater influent 34 4 86 1 ng l 1 and effluent 2 18 74 2 ng l 1 liu et al 2017 furthermore bpaf and bps concentrations in polycarbonate bottled water might reach 4 9 ng l 1 and 10 6 ng l 1 respectively wang et al 2020 recent investigations have revealed that bpa alternatives could exhibit physiological damage luo et al 2020 wang et al 2006 underscoring the critical need for more extensive research on bpa and its analogues bpa alternatives can be more resistant to biological degradation than bpa itself yang et al 2019 within 28 days the anaerobic process had little effect on bps or bpaf degradation luo et al 2020 the half life of bpaf in an aerobic sludge process was estimated to be 22 36 days which is much longer than that of 1 day for bpa luo et al 2020 the average removal efficiency for bpa bpe and bpaf at a standard municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp was 69 3 19 5 and 52 5 respectively wang et al 2019a the negative values of bpe and bpaf were probably attributed to their robust structure absence of degrading bacteria and the release from the conjugate forms implying that bpe and bpaf were recalcitrant and could not be effectively removed in current municipal wastewater treatment processes madrid and zayas 2007 rodayan et al 2014 sun et al 2017 previous studies showed that sulfate radical so4 2 5 3 1 v induced advanced oxidation processes sr aops are efficient options for the elimination of refractory organic pollutants in wastewater treatment wang and wang 2018 the freely diffusible so4 has a longer lifetime and allows for excellent mass transfer and contact with the target contaminant wacławek et al 2017 generally so4 can be yielded from activation of persulfate ps by heat light transition metal or electrochemical methods gu et al 2019 matzek and carter 2016 zhang et al 2015 of these options uv light has been widely used in drinking water treatment without producing secondary pollution in the environmental as a result the uv activated persulfate uv ps system could be a promising candidate for removing bpa and its analogues from the aquatic environment however previous investigations focused solely on the removal of a single bpa contaminant according to recent research bps degradation possessed a similarity in terms of physicochemical properties transformation performance and physiological toxicity with bpa which can be ascribed to the existence of bi p hydroxyphenyl structure luo et al 2020 thus we hypothesize in this work that the degradation characteristics of different bps using so4 induced removal technology including degradation mechanisms and influencing trends by water matrix revealed similarly a generalized model was designed and developed on the basis of this assumption this model can be regarded as a core and basis of kinetic analysis to predict the decomposition efficiency of various bps to quantify the steady state concentrations of ros and to examine the impacts of various solution chemistry conditions and water matrix constituents second order rate constants of so4 reacting with bps were employed as significant independent variables in the model this study aims to assess the generality and diversity on the kinetics toxicity and dft studies of sulfate radical induced transformation of five bps i e bpa bpaf bpe bpf and bps using a generalized kinetic model differentiation analysis on reaction dynamics and degradation pathways for various bps removal was conducted and summarized as the system model in the so4 mediated oxidation process transformation products and vulnerable positions of bps molecules were determined according to frontier molecular orbital theory and density functional theory the acute toxicity of parent compounds and intermediates after uv ps oxidation was also assessed to our best knowledge this will be the first comprehensive study on so4 induced transformation of bpa analogues which would benefit to evaluate the substitutability and potential risks of bpa and its alternatives 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals bisphenol a bpa 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl

phosphate buffer 10 mm was used to keep the ph between 4 5 9 5 unless otherwise stated the initial concentrations of bps and ps were 12 μm and 0 8 mm respectively at designated time intervals 1 5 ml samples were withdrawn and immediately quenched with 0 1 ml sodium thiosulfate 0 5 m each experiment was conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods concentrations of bpa bpaf bpe bpf and bps in the aqueous phase were measured by using high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters e2695 usa equipped with a waters c18 reversed phase column 5 μm 150 4 6 mm and a 2489 uv detector at uv wavelengths of 276 270 280 230 and 262 nm respectively the mobile phases of meoh and 0 1 formic acid v v 30 70 were employed to separate bps within 7 min 1 0 ml min and the column temperature was maintained at 35 c chemical oxidation intermediates of bps were identified by a high resolution mass hrms using q exactive hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer thermo scientific usa analytes

mutagenicity yang et al 2020 2 4 kinetic model and predictions photolysis of ps results in the formation of so4 which subsequently converts to ho via a ph dependent redox reaction between h2o oh and

possible reactions in uv ps systems as well as their rate constants the decontamination process of bps in the uv activated ps system was predicted using a pseudo steady state model it is assumed that reactive oxygen species ros such as so4 and ho generated by ps photolysis were responsible for bps removal and their concentrations remained at a steady state fang et al 2014 fu et al 2019 the steady

the total pseudo first order rate constant of radicals to bps degradation in uv ps process 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of reaction rate constants of bps degradation the removal performance of bps was evaluated under three conditions including uv photolysis alone ps oxidation alone in the dark and a combination of uv ps the results showed that bpa bpaf bpe and bpf were completely degraded in the uv ps process within 30 min while their mitigations in the direct uv photolysis less than 3 or dark ps oxidation less than 1 were all insignificant fig 1 a thus the uv efficiently activated ps to destruct these bps however bps degradation was resistant to the uv ps process with about half of the bps remaining after 30 min indicating that its degradation kinetic was distinct from these of bpa to shed light on the ros effect on bps removal we further carried out scavenging tests in the uv ps process in brief methanol meoh was used as a probe compound for the total flux of so4 kso4 meoh 3 2 106 m 1s 1 and oh koh meoh 9 7 106 m 1s 1 xie et al 2015 and tert butanol tba was used as a specific scavenger for oh koh tba 3 2 7 6 108 m 1s 1 but not so4 kso4 tba 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 malathi et al 2017 priya et al 2018 the addition of meoh significantly inhibited bps degradation whereas that of tba was ineffective fig 1b the results demonstrated that so4 rather than ho played a principal role in bps decomposition to distinguish the reactivity of bps towards so4 and ho kinetic competition tests were conducted using benzoic acid ba as the probe compound kba so4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 and kba ho 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 in the uv ps and uv h2o2 systems respectively vogna et al 2004 in uv h2o2 process h2o2 could be homogeneously cleaved by uv activation generating highly oxygen reactive species to attack organic molecules in which oh plays the significant role lee et al 2021 10 mm tba was added to quench ho in the uv ps system enabling so4 as the major oxidant the second

result at ph 7 5 the second order rate constants of so4 reacting with bpa bpaf bpe bpf and bps i e k8 in table 2 were calculated to be 1 85 109 1 54 109 1 18 109 4 31 108 and 1 09 108 m 1 s 1 respectively in the same manner at ph 7 5 the second order rate constants of ho reacting with bpa bpaf bpe bpf and bps i e k9 in table 2 were estimated to be 2 40 109 2 34 109 3 17 109 1 73 109 and 5 17 108 m 1 s 1 respectively fig 1d the second order rate constants for bps degradation with so4 were slightly lower than those with ho the difference could be due to the selectivity of so4 or various bridging atom and groups of bps structure 3 2 comparative kinetic analyses on bps degradation degradation of the five selected bps was evaluated in the uv ps system under different conditions of persulfate dosages 0 2 1 2 mm reaction ph 4 5 9 5 bicarbonate 0 10 mm chloride 0 10 mm and nom 0 3 mg l 1 concentrations the pseudo first order rate constants kobs were theoretically predicted and experimentally estimated and compared among these bps the obtained kobs values of bpaf against these reaction conditions are illustrated in figs 2 a e and those of other bps are detailed in figs s2 s8 the effect of different persulfate dosages on bpaf degradation kinetics is presented in fig 2a the kobs value was estimated to be 2 26 0 25 10 4 s 1 at a ps dosage of 0 2 mm and linearly increased to 2 70 0 74 10 3 s 1 with the dosage increasing to 1 2 mm showing a relative increase of 12 times the result is consistent with previous observations on the degradation kinetics of amaranth dye as higher ps dosage can produce more abundant ros lin et al 2017 the estimated kobs values for bpa bpe and bpf were nearly comparable to bpaf fig s2 however the kobs value of bps only increased 3 times with increasing ps dosage likely because bps had lower reactivity with so4 and ho the kinetic prediction results i e kcal obs well agreed with the measured data fig 2a indicating the validity of the model table s1 according to the modeling analysis the effects of different ros i e so4 and ho on bps degradation were derived the kcal so4 gradually increased as the ps dose was raised whereas kcal ho was almost neglectable this further demonstrates that so4 rather than ho contributes to bps degradation in the uv ps system the reaction ph has a significant effect on the removal of organic contaminants in the uv ps system in previous reports the ph effect was controversial luo et al 2016 herein we investigated the effect of ph ranging from 4 5 to 9 5 on degradation kinetics of bps the results showed that the kobs values of bps reduced by 32 55 when the ph increased fig 2b and fig s3 this indicates that an acidic environment favors the degradation of organic compounds by uv ps consistent to luo et al luo et al 2016 on the one hand despite the fact that the generation of secondary radicals i e hpo4 were proved to be derived from the reaction between phosphate buffer and ros in the uv ps process the modeling results kcal obs well fit the experimental data without taking hpo4 into account this thereby implies an insignificant role of hpo4 in bps removal on the other hand there was limited contribution from the physicochemical properties of oxidant e g molar absorption coefficient and the quantum efficiency of photo dissociation of ps in bps degradation yu et al 2004 as shown in fig s4 ps self dissociation was identical between ph 4 5 9 5 consequently the generation of so4 in the uv ps process was not affected by ph nevertheless raising the ph from 4 5 to 9 5 reduced the steady state concentrations of so4 during bps degradation by 55 60 table s1 on the basis of the reactions 11 12 in table 2 the calculation of kinetic model showed that the overall quenching capacity of phosphate k11 h2po4 k12 hpo4 2 increased from 7 40 102 s 1 to 1 19 104 s 1 when the ph climbed from 4 5 to 9 5 therefore the varying quenching magnitude and the weakened removal efficiency in uv ps process are induced by the scavenging effects of h2po4 and hpo4 2 wang and wang 2020 xu and wang 2012 inorganic ions e g hco3 and cl and natural organic matter nom are ubiquitous in natural water bodies and have been shown to affect the decontamination efficiency in sr aops wang and wang 2021a generally hco3 can react with so4 and ho at the rate constants around 106 m 1s 1 according to reactions 16 and 17 in table 2 pereira et al 2007 cl is also commonly considered as a radical scavenger to suppress the removal process of organic contaminants reactions 20 and 21 in table 2 hou et al 2018 hence the hco3 and cl effects were integrated into the bps degradation model as illustrated in fig 2c and fig s5 the experimental results revealed that in the presence of 10 mm hco3 kobs for bps degradation dropped to 30 50 the estimated steady state concentrations of so4 and ho reduced dramatically to 15 38 whereas co3 became three orders of magnitude higher than that of so4 table s1 the negative impact of hco3 could be associated with the transformation of so4 and ho to co3 via electron transfer as known co3 act as a selective chemical oxidant e0 1 78 v at ph 7 for the degradation of organic pollutants with the second order rate constants ranging within 10 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 however the measured kobs agreed with the predicted kcal obs by the model that excluded co3 this thereby suggests an insignificant role of co3 for bps degradation the kobs values of bps degradation decreased by 10 43 in the presence of 1 mm cl concentration and then maintained stable after raising cl to 10 mm fig 2d and fig s6 this was likely ascribed to the transformation of reactive so4 and ho to less reactive chlorine ros grebel et al 2010 the kinetic model prediction showed that the presence of 1 mm cl substantially reduced the steady state so4 concentration by four orders of magnitude while increasing the ho concentration by one order of magnitude the higher regeneration rate of ho than so4 was achieved reactions 29 in table 2 indicating ho served as the dominant radical in the uv ps chloride system for the removal of bps it is to be noted that the modelled kcal obs values were slightly lower than the measured kobs in the so4 mediated decontamination technology secondary radicals e g cl cl2 and cloh are the predominant radical species in the presence of cl reactions 18 29 in table 2 the second order rate constants of cl and cl2 reacting with bpa at ph 7 5 were determined to be 1 82 1010 and 5 82 108 m 1 s 1 respectively in previous investigations lei et al 2019b other bps may perform similar reactivity to chloride radicals at 106 1010 m 1 s 1 level due to the presence of bi p hydroxyphenyl structure furthermore according to the calculations of the kinetic model the steady state concentrations of cl cl2 and cloh increased from 0 to 2 04 0 52 10 20 s 1 8 4 3 8 10 10 s 1 and 1 46 0 14 10 12 s 1 respectively with the cl concentration rising from 0 to 10 mm these results indicate that secondary chlorine radicals are critical in the uv ps system for bps degradation tan et al 2017 wang et al 2015 bps degradation kinetics were assessed at ph 7 5 with a nom of 0 3 mg l 1 and the results are shown in fig 2e and fig s7 the kobs values of bps degradation fell by 20 41 in the presence of 3 mg l 1 nom of note nom could inhibit the bps degradation through different routes on the one hand nom competed with organic contaminants for so4 and ho at rate constants of 2 50 104 mg l 1 s 1 and 1 30 104 mg l 1 s 1 respectively as reactions 30 and 31 in table 2 xie et al 2015 when nom reached 3 mg l 1 the calculated steady state concentrations of so4 and ho dropped by more than one order of magnitude table s1 on the other hand nom act as an inner filter of uv transmittance at 254 nm to suppress the bps photolysis and so4 production with the absorption coefficient of 3 15 l m 1 mg 1 εnom luo et al 2016 to quantify the respective contribution of the radical quenching and inner filter effects to bps degradation two kinetic models were established with the assumption of εnom 0 or that the rate constants of reactions between nom and ros were zero k30 k31 0 in table 2 as illustrated in fig 2e and fig s8 the kobs well fitted the modelled results of assuming k30 k31 0 rather than εnom 0 therefore quenching was identified to be the key factor affecting bps degradation summing up the above results fig 2f reflected the fluctuation and amplitude of kobs induced by various factors statistical differences between bpa and its analogues were accessed by one way analysis of variance using the tukey post hoc test p values below 0 05 were considered significant the removal of bpaf and bpe in the uv ps system had insignificant differences p 0 05 with bpa in contrast the difference between bpf bps and bpa was significant p 0 001 by employing the second order rate constants of so4 and ho reacting with bps as independent variables in pseudo steady state model all results obtained from the model predictions were in accord with the experimental results it can therefore be concluded that the difference of degradation kinetics among these bps is ascribed to the diverse reaction activity of ros 3 3 generality and diversity on bps transformation pathways the aforementioned experimental and model data clearly demonstrated that the bps was principally degraded by so4 generated in the uv ps process to clarify the underlying transformation mechanisms we attempted to determine the vulnerable sites of the bp molecular structures towards so4 the frontier molecular orbital theory mo the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo were adopted to predict the highest active positions during the oxidation reactions in which the sites with higher fed2 lumo fed2 homo values were regarded as the atomic free radical attack positions ji et al 2013 wahab et al 2009 as depicted in fig 3 the homos of bpa bpaf bpe bpf and bps were estimated to be 0 206 0 225 0 206 0 207 and 0 234 ev respectively and the lumos as 0 002 0 016 0 001 0 003 and 0 037 ev respectively this reveals electron flows at different sites as for homo π bonding orbitals were observed on the phenolic structure for the lumo π antibonding orbitals occurred on the benzene ring accompanied by the torsional deformation to the bridging atom between two phenol groups as summarized in tables s2 s6 the negative charge was concentrated on the o atom of the phenolic hydroxyl group and the ortho position c atom of the benzene ring the ortho position c atoms served as active sites for oxidation reactions with the highest density of fed2 homo fed2 lumo specifically the meta position c atoms of the benzene ring in the bpe molecule and the para position c atoms of the phenol on the molecular structure of bps were also subject to the free radical attack with higher values of fed2 homo fed2 lumo on the basis of the density functional theory dft the fukui indexes including radical attack f a 0 electrophilic attack f a 1 and nucleophilic attack f a 1 for various bps were adopted to forecast the attacking locations on bps molecules as summarized in tables s7 s11 the ortho position c atoms of the benzene ring was the highest active position for the oxidative destruction by ros with the highest fa 0 value ascribed to the presence of similar bi p hydroxyphenyl structures and active sites degradation characteristics i e removal mechanisms and influencing trends by water matrix of bps in the uv ps process inclined to be identical as illustrated in the representative chromatograms fig s9 s13 tentative oxidation intermediates of bps were identified table s12 during uv ps treatment the proposed plausible transformation pathways of bpa bpaf bpe bpf and bps were shown in figs 4 in short prevalent degradation reactions include hydroxylation electron transfer substitution and rearrangement as below initially radical cations r2 were generated via electron transfer then monohydroxylated bps r4 and dehydroxylated bps r5 were produced due to the susceptibility of ortho position c atoms of r2 1c and 5c sites in fig 4 to ros pathway 1 in fig 4 sharma et al 2015 sharma et al 2016 besides hydroxylation adducts r4 and r5 could be generated via hydroxylation reactions or oxygen transfer reactions li et al 2018 torres et al 2008 the above results showed that ho was a minor contributor to bps degradation the ho presented specific selectivity to six membered heterocyclic compounds and thereby resulting in additional reactions pathway 2 in fig 4 poerschmann et al 2010 the precursors of the hydroxylation adducts r4 and r5 including phenoxy radicals r6 and other resonance intermediates r7 and r8 were produced on the account of the delocalization of an electron yang et al 2019 subsequently ros preferentially attacked the ortho position of the phenol moiety 1c and 5c sites according to the mo and dft calculations leading to the formation of r4 and r5 pathway 3 in fig 4 following that the generated hydroxylation adducts r4 and r5 could be oxidized by ortho cleavage and produced ring opening products such as a b and c despite the absence of these similar parallel intermediates the degradation of bpaf and bps produced other ring opening products after hydroxylation with ortho cleavage and para cleavage k in fig s10 and l m in fig s13 which agrees with the results of fed2 homo fed2 lumo the ring cleavage intermediates were oxidized by ros and reconstituted with a hydroxylated benzene ring resulting in the formation of i and j the generated radicals r8 in pathway 3 could further produce cations r9 and secondary radicals r10 via the β scission route pathway 3 in fig 4 walling and padwa 1963 these compounds shifted to x y bond cleavage intermediates f and phenol g most of the aromatic products identified in this study could be further transformed into low molecular weight intermediates through ring opening reactions and finally mineralized into co2 and h2o 3 4 toxicity assessment of the products from bps degradation toxicity estimation software tool t e s t software was used to assess the acute toxicity of various bps and their intermediates by determining the lethal concentration of 50 fathead minnow lc50 96 h and oral rat ld50 wang and wang 2021b in several recent studies the offspring of mice exposed to bpa exhibited inherited changes in dna expression as well as aberrant immune system harris et al 2018 hence bioaccumulation was considered in the toxicity assessment in this work although bpa analogues were previously considered to be relatively safe this study shows that bpaf and bpe exhibited more toxic than bpa as shown in fig 5 and table s13 fathead minnow lc50 96 h estimated for bpaf and bpe were 1 96 and 2 08 mg l 1 respectively both of which are below that of bpa 3 01 mg l 1 the oral rat ld50 96 h estimated for bpa 3196 23 mg kg 1 was also substantially higher than that for bpaf 306 91 mg kg 1 this indicates that bpaf shows moderately toxic according to the hodge and sterner toxicity classification scale therefore the replacement of bpa with some analogues such as bpaf and bpe would be expected to result in potential environmental problems it should be urgent to establish effective treatment processes to mitigate bps in water matrixes moreover some tentative intermediates generated from bps degradation even possessed higher developmental toxicity than the parent compounds for example the proposed intermediates e h i and j in fig 4 tended to exhibit higher toxicity than the original bps based on the results of the fathead minnow lc50 96 h and developmental toxicity value the proposed intermediate g in fig 4 was classified as moderate risk based on the results of the oral rat ld50 96 h these undesirable byproducts would induce abnormal development in humans and animals nevertheless because of the low concentrations of intermediates their overall toxicity following uv ps treatment remains unclear and more research is needed furthermore based on the above comparative kinetic analyses on bps degradation realistic wastewater with varying ph bicarbonate chloride and nom concentrations would induce a variety of degradation kinetics and transformation pathways necessitating additional attention to the generation of novel intermediates formed by secondary radicals e g cl cl2 and co3 toxicity is a function of the treated water the presence of various constituents and their concentrations but this was not taken into account in this study which has to be looked into further 4 conclusions this study contributed to a better knowledge of the kinetic patterns transformation mechanism and toxicity variation of bpa and its analogues in a uv activated ps treatment process main conclusions include degradation characteristics i e removal mechanisms and influencing trends by water matrix of bps using so4 mediated decontamination technology inclined to be identical the generalized pseudo steady state model in which second order rate constants of so4 reacting with bps are a series of critical constraints to mediate the difference on degradation kinetics can estimate the oxidation efficiency of a range of bps in the uv ps system quickly and accurately the bps degradation rate was ph dependent due to varied scavenging effect of phosphate at different ph hco3 and cl had negative influences on kobs because so4 and ho were transformed into less reactive intermediate radical species inhibiting effect of nom on the bps degradation is attributed to the radical quenching effect and inner filter effect of which the former played a dominant role as for the molecular structure of bps the ortho position c atoms on the benzene ring and the o atom of the phenolic hydroxyl group served as susceptible sites for so4 and ho assaults according to the tentative degradation intermediates theoretical calculation and literature the transformation pathways of bps were further proposed which included hydroxylation electron transfer substitution and rearrangement driven by ortho cleavage in the uv activated ps process of note bpaf and bpe exhibited more toxic than bpa and some transformation intermediates had higher toxicity than the parent chemicals declaration of

sampling campaign performed on a nereda plant located in utrecht 52 11215 5 10813 the netherlands sampling was performed over 3 days monday wednesday and friday within the same week under dry weather conditions without significant variations in hydraulic retention time 20 h since the sludge retention time was relatively long 30 days in average 40 days for large granules and 10 days for small granules and flocs in this installation the 3 sampling days were considered as biological replicates biological samples were collected every day from pre settled influent wastewater from the mixed liquor at the beginning i e after anaerobic feeding of the wastewater and end of the aeration phase and from the effluent of the sbr fig 1 a total volumes of 1 l of influent and 1 l of effluent were collected as a 24 h flow proportional composite samples for the other process points the sludge was sampled from the top of the tank as grab samples of 1 l with a pole container during the daily operations of the sbr all samples were transported in a cooled container and processed within a time frame of less than 4 h prior to dna extraction the granular sludge samples were sieved in 3

contigs resulting from the sequencing of only the idna pools of bioaggregates were binned with metabat version 2 2 15 kang et al 2019 to reconstruct metagenome assembled genomes mags on default parameters the mags were used to analyze secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters 2 4 generation of the taxonomic database of aerated granular sludge a database of sequences from mags contigs and reads specific to the microbial environment of ags was built to accurately profile the microbiome the kraken 2 0 standard database of 9 1 gbp of genomic sequences wood et al 2019 was used as a basis however because complete genomes of the organisms found in ags systems were often unavailable in the kraken 2 0 database additional genetic fragments specific to some taxa were added to the database as an example abundant genera in ags like tetrasphaera trichococcus and candidatus accumulibacter were not or poorly annotated in the standard database used in kraken2 0 in total 94 005 sequences of 2 223 unique taxa were added to the kraken 2 0 standard database the taxa of the ags samples were classified from both short reads and contig sequences by combining the metaphlan3 0 truong et al 2015 mg rast meyer et al 2018 and kraken2 0 wood et al 2019 computational tools for phylogenetic analysis of metagenomics data with their corresponding databases as well as blastn to align contigs of 1500 bp against the midas database of 16s rrna gene sequences with a cut off e value 10 5 and sequence identity 97 https www midasfieldguide org nierychlo et al 2020 a literature study was conducted in which taxa were added to the database if theoretically present above 1 relative abundance but not present in the database kraken2 0 takes all the sequences added in a selected database and finds k mers short genomic substrings specific for certain taxa for further taxonomic classification the reads full and partial genomes of the predominant taxa were added to the adapted taxonomic database of ags when these lineages were detected above 1 of relative abundance from the metagenomics datasets using one of the previously described classification tool but not present in the kraken2 0 database this was performed on taxonomic levels from phylum to species 2 5 microbiome profiling of idna and exdna pools obtained from the ags process kraken2 0 with short reads as input was selected to profile the microbiome classification with kraken2 0 was performed on pair end mode on the quality controlled short reads using the newly constructed database the taxonomic classification was also performed on contigs 500 bp that were identified to contain args see 2 6 hereafter in order to determine potential args hosts the taxonomic classification outcomes from kraken2 0 were converted into abundance tables using the pavian visualization tool breitwieser and salzberg 2020 to explore metagenomics classification datasets heatmaps were generated with the r package pheatmap kolde 2019 2 6 resistome and mobilome profiling of idna and exdna obtained from the ags process args were annotated by aligning the assembled contigs 500 bp to the resfinder 4 0 resistance gene database using the blastn nucleotide alignment tool with a cut off e value of 10 5 and sequence identity above 90 bortolaia et al 2020 mges were classified on the same set of contigs 500 bp using blastn by aligning them with the same cut off and sequence identity setpoints to the following databases depending to the types of mges bacterial insertion sequences were identified by aligning against the isfinder database siguier et al 2006 integrons integrases and gene cassettes were identified using the integrall database moura et al 2009 bacterial integrative and conjugative elements were identified using the iceberg database liu et al 2019 for all queries the arg or mge identified with the best score i e equal to the sequence identity multiplied by the coverage factor was selected to annotate the query blastn was performed with different databases resfinder 4 0 for args and isfinder integrall and iceberg for mges on the same set of contigs to identify where args and mges co localized blastn was performed with a cut off e value of 10 5 and sequence identity above 90 contigs 500 bp that simultaneously contained hits from the resfinder 4 0 database and at least one of the different mge databases were considered to have co localized the contigs that contained both args and mges were used as input queries against the ncbi plasmid database in order to know if such contig belonged to a plasmid a contig was identified as part of a potential plasmid if exclusively aligning with plasmids in the entire ncbi plasmid database with sequence identities 90 2 7 functional genetic analysis of idna and exdna pools obtained from the sludge prokka version 1 14 5 was used to annotate the assembled contigs 500 bp with the default databases and parameters on metagenomic mode seemann 2014 k numbers were assigned to all predicted coding sequences cdss using ghostkoala after which the kegg database was used for analyse the functional and amr pathways kanehisa et al 2002 seemann 2014 the antibiotics and secondary metabolites analysis shell antismash v5 0 tool was used to identify annotate and analyze the secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters such as involved on antibiotics production in mags binned from the idna bioaggregate samples blin et al 2021 2 8 multidimensional scaling analysis to cluster microbiome and resistome datasets to identify patterns between the microbiome and resistome different types of ordination and statistical numerical methods were performed using the r software the input data was the output of the taxonomic classification from kraken2 0 with the adapted database details can be found in supplementary material the dimensions of the metagenomics datasets were reduced using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds principal coordinates analysis pcoa and t distributed stochastic neighbor embedding t sne these methods were applied to the taxonomic data at phylum and genus levels and to the amr group data for all methods scree plots stress plot and shepard plots were used to visualized the data accurately in two dimensions t sne was applied using the tsne package and a maximum of 2 000 iterations and a perplexity parameter of 5 as input van der maaten and hinton 2008 pcoa t sne and nmds were performed on different taxonomic levels and on the resistome data fig s3 all dimension reductions yielded similar clustering patterns giving equivalent results for each sampling point and sample type pcoa was therefore chosen as representative analysis to characterize the similarities and differences between samples 2 9 quantitative pcr of selected args to evaluate the wwtp performance in terms of removing args and mges to examine their presence during the different process steps and to track their transfer between idna and exdna fractions a molecular analysis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr was applied to detect a selected panel of genes table 2 from the three biological replicates monday wednesday and friday of the samples listed in table 1 all idna and exdna analytes isolated from the three biological sample from the influent beginning and end of aeration and effluent of the sbr were used for qpcr each analyte was measured in technical duplicates by qpcr the 16s rrna and rpob reference genes were quantified for the normalization of gene copies to the

macrolides ermb fluoroquinolones qnrs sulfonamides sul1 sul2 and tetracyclines teto the inti1 gene encoding the class i integron integrase was quantified these integrase class i cassettes are related

observe the clustering effects in data related to the specific sample dna fraction fig 1b the influent samples showed a large difference in composition for both the idna and exdna pools microbial compositions of sewage can vary over an active week based on the variety of emission sources and streams in a wastewater catchment area and environmental factors pallares vega et al 2021 in the effluent a lower variability between the two samples was observed for the idna fraction the taxonomic composition of the idna of the effluent highly resembled the composition of the idna of activated sludge floc fraction in the treatment reactor on the other hand the phylogenetic signatures of the exdna fraction of the effluent showed a larger variation between the samples in the wastewater treatment plant microbial cells can lyse releasing idna as exdna the exdna fractions might not persist as free floating during the whole process it can adhere to particles get degraded or taken up via natural transformation in competent cells dong et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 however we mainly studied the free floating exdna as we hypothesize it would be the main exdna fraction being released in the effluents rather than the attached to particles or aggregates from the different size fractions of bioaggregates in the sludge the microbial community compositions of the small blue in fig 1b and large red granules were similar while the flocs orange clustered separately this is similar as the observations by ali et al 2019 that the floc fraction is more diverse and contains a large number of bacteria originating from the influent wastewater microbial niches establish along gradients of substrates and other dissolved components like oxygen and nitrogen oxides inside bioaggregates winkler et al 2018 the taxonomic affiliations of the exdna sequences of the mixed liquor sampled at the end of aeration were similar to those of the idna extracted from small and large granules rather than the flocs this suggests that exdna was released from the granules by cell lysis during aeration sengar et al 2018 and toh et al 2003 have shown that dead biomass releases its genetic material into the extracellular environment during the ags process in activated sludge yuan et al 2019 have identified that the taxa reflected by the idna and exdna fractions are similar suggesting a correlation between changes in the microbial composition of the activated sludge and in exdna using the same exdna extraction methodology we have shown in a previous study that exdna present in activated sludge mainly originates from decaying microbial populations rather than from transport from the influent calderón franco et al 2021 the taxonomic composition of the exdna fraction in the ags system was mainly related to the microbiome present in the granular sludge 3 2 ags microbiome and potential involvement in amr dissemination the patterns of relative abundances of genera in the different stages of the ags process and in the idna and exdna fractions were examined by constructing a heatmap fig 1c for the clusters observed by pcoa using the standard kraken2 0 database ncbi based 2 548 genera were identified from the whole set of idna and exdna analytes 57 genera were more abundant than 1 of sequencing read counts and 15 of those were predominant above 3 in at least one of the samples fig s4 symbols the average annotation rate of the reads was 24 7 3 2 i e leaving three quarters of the taxonomic information of the reads as to uncover to increase the reads annotation rate a new database of genetic sequences of the ags microbial environment was constructed with this database the average annotation rate was 27 1 3 4 2 679 genera were identified 55 genera were above 1 relative abundance and 21 were above 3 in at least one of the analytes fig s4 although this new annotation rate was only 3 higher than the standard database important ags genera were now identified metagenomic studies can be hindered by low annotation rates as a consequence of the high fraction of natural microbes that have not been included in the databases the current development of databases of high quality mags and properly curated databases will help enhance annotation rates in the future singleton et al 2021 from fig 1 b the exdna taxonomic compositions at the beginning of aeration resembled the exdna from influent while at the end of aeration from both days closely resembled the idna fractions from small and large granules flocs displayed a unique profile while the phylogenic distribution of the effluent exdna resembled the granule phylogeny the effluent idna resembled the flocs from both beginning and end of aeration during the fill draw operation of the sbr flocs leave the tank with the selection spill therefore reducing their retention time in the process guo et al 2020 the diversity of abundant populations in the ags detected by metagenomics is listed in fig 1c several of these populations are involved in the conversions of c n p nutrients in the microbial ecosystem of ags weissbrodt et al 2014 winkler et al 2018 like ca accumulibacter tetrasphaera dechloromonas c p ca competibacter zoogloea xanthomonas rhodoferax pseudomonas acidovorax comamonas rhizobium c n nitrospira n and acinetobacter c among others some relate to filamentous bulking phenomena like ca microthrix bulkholderia nocardioides kouleothrix some thrive on metabolites and lysis products from other organisms like flavobacterium bacteroides and hydrogenophaga among many others the metabolic functions of other organisms in the ags remains to be uncovered less beneficial organisms are arcobacter and aeromonas that are known pathogens arcobacter crosses wwtps from influent to effluent without settling properly kristensen et al 2020 the presence in the influent of exdna affiliating with ca accumulibacter can relate to the recirculation line coming from the sludge thickener among the different populations identified from the ags fig 1c several are known to carry amr related genes acidovorax 3 5 0 6 is a known carrier of beta lactamase resistance plasmids in activated sludge samples zhang et al 2011 rhodoferax 3 5 0 5 has been identified to be of high relative abundance in wastewater effluent while often identified as a carrier of resistance genes zhou et al 2020 nitrospirae 4 1 1 1 may play a role in amr dissemination because it is a known host of iargs and exargs in wwtps zhou et al 2019 guo et al 2017 used metagenomics to identify candidatus accumulibacter 2 1 0 5 as a possible carrier of resistance genes over the wwt operation aeromonas was relatively abundant in all our samples 1 88 0 84 notably the three most critical antibiotic resistant pathogens as designated by the world health organization are acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae tacconelli and magrini 2017 acinetobacter and pseudomonas were abundant across samples figs 1c and s4 we suggest that recovering and annotating mags for these populations out of ags biomass could help identify whether they harbour pathogenic traits or not interestingly the relative abundances of exdna sequences affiliating with the genera candidatus microthrix exdna at beginning of aeration 0 5 0 1 vs at end of aeration 5 6 2 0 acidovorax 1 2 0 1 vs 4 3 0 2 rhodoferax 1 8 0 2 vs 7 9 1 3 and zoogloea 0 8 0 2 vs 2 6 0 5 increased over the aeration period these filamentous bacteria ca microthrix and denitrifiers were abundant 3 in the granule fractions of the sbr but not in flocs these microbial populations are known to populate ags used for full biological nutrient removal winkler et al 2018 the presence of exdna in the water phase can relate to cell lysis or to active release from the cells acinetobacter idna 6 1 2 8 exdna 3 4 2 2 flavobacterium 1 2 0 4 1 0 0 5 and pseudomonas 4 3 0 9 4 0 1 1 secrete dna in the extracellular environment during growth in liquid media pietramellara et al 2009 collectively we had identified the main microbial players in the granular sludge microbiome and the relationship with exdna fractions and the possible involvement in the dissemination of resistance determinants further mechanistic insights using well controlled experiments with systems microbiology methods are required to identify whether cell decay or active secretion can explain the release of exdna from microorganisms of the sludge 3 3 a wide range of args are present in the effluent exdna the resistome of wastewater systems exhibits a large diversity of args as many as 2 840 args were identified from all the samples belonging to 15 antibiotic subgroups args affiliating with mls macrolide lincosamide and streptogramin n 910 reads aminoglycosides n 598 reads sulphonamides n 375 reads beta lactam n 330 reads and tetracycline n 233 reads were the most abundant fig 2 a the resistome profiles matched with hendriksen et al 2019 macrolides are the most abundant args in urban sewage in europe followed by aminoglycosides and beta lactams all samples including the different types of bioaggregates and idna and exdna fractions contained args the exdna resistome profiles at beginning and end of aeration resembled the idna resistomes of granules similar to observations made on taxonomic affiliations of exdna sequences exargs mainly originated from the granules rather than from flocs in the effluent exdna was a combination of fragments coming from the influent idna fig 2b being in the day 2 part of the bigger dendogram plus the different bioaggregates the 5 most abundant args over all samples were aminoglycoside arr 3 gene n 58 reads tetracycline tet c n 46 reads sulfonamide sul1 n 44 reads multidrug efflux pump oqxb n 34 reads and aminoglycoside aph 3 ib n 34 reads taken together n 216 reads these genes only amount to 7 6 of the total args identified this high diversity of resistance genes matches with another metagenomic analysis of activated sludge samples zhou et al 2019 of all 478 args identified in the effluent 89 were carried by exdna this can present a risk for amr dissemination in the environment and for health by natural transformation of exdna fragments in microorganisms present in receiving water bodies and drinking water resources especially for the resistance determinants to the last resource antibiotics such as carbapenem and colistin the types of exarg and iarg were similar matching with zhou et al 2019 in contrast using pcr only li et al 2020 detected dissimilar compositions of iargs and exargs during sludge granulation at pilot scale early stage granulation is a dynamic process involving changing community compositions along the establishment of physicochemical gradients e g increasing anaerobic zones in granules sengar et al 2018 this can lead to bacteria decay and dna release shifts over the process therefore leading to variations in arg profiles as well here mature granules from the full scale ags wwtp were used to track the fate of args under pseudo steady state conditions overall the effluent exdna is an overlooked dna fraction that needs to be considered for future risk analysis it is a highly diverse fraction regarding antibiotic resistance genes 3 4 gram negative bacteria are potential carriers of args in the ags all contigs 500 bp containing args were taxonomically classified to identify which microorganisms carried and potentially released args figs 2b and s4 as high as 98 of contigs containing args were annotated with taxonomy a contig affiliated to a taxon does not necessarily mean that the read comes from that specific organism different populations can share similar arg sequences the contigs containing args over the whole metagenomic dataset of all samples and fractions were affiliated to gram negative genera like pseudomonas 8 4 0 7 rhodoferax 5 6 0 9 acinetobacter 4 3 1 4 aeromonas 3 1 1 1 xanthomonas 3 9 0 9 and acidovorax 1 9 0 4 as well as the gram positive and antibiotic producing genus streptomyces 1 6 0 4 fig s4 pseudomonas and rhodoferax genera s high abundance pattern were similar between the two sampling days fig 2b idna contigs containing args in small and large granules were affiliated at several instances to rhodoferax 10 1 0 4 in granules out of the contigs where args were localized the arg containing exdna affiliated to rhodoferax beginning of aeration 2 0 0 5 end of aeration 11 0 2 9 this increase suggests that dna was released from rhodoferax cells during aeration rhodoferax is abundant in wwtp effluents and often identified as amr carriers by encoding multiple efflux pumps jin et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 args have been identified from mags retrieved from activated sludge from danish wwtps miłobedzka et al 2022 singleton et al 2021 rhodoferax was the most abundant population containing multiple args the effluent idna is mainly composed of microorganisms that go through the process without being removed from bacteria growing on suspended solids and of microorganisms detached from the ags bioaggregates some microorganisms that entered the ags plant in high abundance and passed through the wwtp are aeromonas and acinetobacter especially in day 1 the effluent was enriched by microorganisms coming mainly from floccular sludge such as lysobacter both days and thermomonas day 2 fig 2b pathogenic arcobacter crossed wwtps from influent to effluent fig 1c but interestingly no arg was detected in any of arcobacter contigs further research needs to be done to clearly identify which args in which mges are inside specific microbial hosts recent analytical advances now allow to identify potential hosts of resistances using hi c sequencing stalder et al 2019 populations of aeromonadaceae moraxellaceae and bacteroidetes were shown to be critical reservoirs of amr in wwtps the resistome results highlight that amr determinants released in exdna during the wastewater operation are importantly linked to gram negative bacteria notably rhodoferax and to potential pathogenic bacterial genera carrying args in the effluent such as pseudomonas and aeromonas 3 5 mges and args often co localize on contigs recovered from the exdna of the effluent both idna and exdna fractions and all bioaggregates were sources of a diversity of mges the different samples yielded 55 344 different mges belonging to bacterial insertion sequences 9 845 reads integrons integrases and gene cassettes 20 149 reads and bacterial integrative conjugative elements 25 350 reads when args and mges co localize on the same genetic fragment there is an increased chance that the fragment can be transferred between bacterial cells since mges facilitate the transfer integration and transposition of genes in genomes this poses a clear risk for arg dissemination from all contigs 500 bp 312 contigs were identified to contain both args and mges table s6 their 5 most abundant args were blavim 48 28 cmx 1 28 sul2 25 teta 24 and aada6 24 a set of 80 contigs contained multiple args and of these 60 also contained mges their 5 most abundant args were all aminoglycoside resistance genes namely aph 3 ib 17 aada6 17 aph 6 id 17 aada11 7 and aac 3 ib 7 multiple co localization patterns were detected only in the idna of granules and in the exdna of the effluent for instance sul2 and teta were exclusively found in the idna from large granules replicate 2 from the end of the aeration and in the effluent exdna fraction replicate 2 this contig also aligned with isvsa3 an insertion sequence often found on plasmids toleman and walsh 2010 of the 60 contigs 500bp were multiple args and mges co localized 3 major groups of contigs are highlighted hereafter because of their abundance in the system or the risk associated with leaving the wwtp in the exdna of the effluent firstly as shown in table s6 15 contigs were identified both as carriers of two aminoglycoside resistance genes aph 3 ib and aph 6 id and as part of transposon tn5393 fig 3 a these contigs were found in all samples across wwt operation for all microbial aggregates and exdna and idna fractions excluding the flocs after alignment to the ncbi nucleotide database the contigs aligned with incq plasmids mostly from populations of acinetobacter and pseudomonas genera previously identified in our wastewater samples incq plasmids are significant since they are related to the broadest host range of all replicating elements in bacteria meyer 2009 they are known to mobilize via conjugation although natural transformation has also been observed bönemann et al 2006 meyer 2009 szczepanowski et al 2009 2004 ellison et al 2018 have proven that double stranded exdna can directly be captured by natural competent bacteria such as the model organisms vibrio cholerae via retraction of dna bound type iv competent pili then 18 contigs aligned with a tn3 family transposon tnas3 normally encoding a β lactamase gene a transposase and a resolvase nicolas et al 2015 as identified from the exdna effluent fraction fig 3b these contigs identities 95 aligned exclusively with plasmids from escherichia coli klebsiella pneumoniae pseudomonas aeruginosa enterobacter cloacae enterobacter kobei and klebsiella oxytoca interestingly of all pathogens the world health organization stressed that addressing carbapenem resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae should have the highest priority tacconelli and magrini 2017 finally another contig of importance found in the exdna fraction of the effluent carried multiple resistance genes against aminoglycosides aac 6 beta lactamases blaoxa 10 and phenicols cmla1 fig 3c this contig aligned with a 100 sequence identity to a plasmid already annotated from aeromonas hydrophila pwcx23 1 carrying 15 different args nwaiwu and aduba 2020 the strong presence of mobilized resistance determinants in the extracellular fraction of the ags wwtp has been also described by ikuma and rehmann 2020 using mathematical modelling they suggested that at the wwtp effluent discharge point in a river the total number count of args was 13 times higher when including exargs on top of iargs collectively exargs in wwtp discharges need to be taken into account for accurate risk assessments of amr co localization studies are valuable tools to identify the genetic structures and potential hosts by which resistance determinants are carried and transferred between bacteria more research needs to be conducted to reconstruct full plasmids from wastewater effluents this will shed light on the type of plasmids released into the environment i e narrow broad range and synthetic naturally occurring and on the genetic constructions args are embedded in multiple args often co localize with mges on contigs from all the sampling points the effluent is one of the predominant pool of mges containing args across the wastewater treatment chain 3 6 no antibiotic related biosynthetic gene clusters were found in the biomass for the most abundant arg identified functional and pathway analyses were performed on the contigs to identify amr pathways and on the mags to identify potential intrinsic antibiotic production by microorganisms that could promote the development and survival of arb in ags systems from all the amr pathways available in the kegg database kanehisa et al 2002 we identified the cationic antimicrobial peptide camp resistance pathway vancomycin resistance pathway and beta lactamase resistance pathway including efflux pumps that actively transport the beta lactam antibiotics out of the cell rnd efflux pumps figs s6 s8 both influent and effluent idna and exdna were sources of genes involved in beta lactam resistance most genes involved in these resistance pathways were present in the influent idna but not in the influent exdna however in the effluent both idna and exdna contained resistance pathways genes from the antismash analysis of mags recovered from small and large granules no mags could be recovered from flocs due to the sequencing depth and short reads used at the end of aeration positive hits on non ribosomal peptide synthetase nrps biosynthetic gene clusters bgcs were detected in mags of nitrospira and janthinobacterium nrps antibiotics include vancomycin polymyxin and teixobactin which are highly effective against multidrug resistant bacteria li et al 2018 the vancomycin resistance pathway was one of the few reconstructed pathways in the samples analyzed fig s6 terpenes indoles t1pks and ectoine bgcs were identified as the most recurrent table s11 no aminoglycosides or beta lactams antibiotic bgcs were found in any of the dna samples from the functional analysis of mags we did not recover full antibiotic production pathways from the main populations identified and that relate to the most abundant args present during the process 3 7 ags treatment is efficient at reducing the load of resistance determinants while some exargs increased over the wwt operation to quantify the arg and arb occurrence and related removal capacity of the ags wwtp a panel of six args and inti1 as mge were quantified by qpcr two normalization methods using 16s rrna and rpob genes were assessed both the args and the mge were consistently detected across all the ags process phases and bioaggregates the most predominant genes throughout the process were the sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 and the class 1 integron gene inti1 fig 4 a these genes were the most concentrated ones in the effluent with 7 5 sul1 and 7 0 inti1 log10 gene copies ml 1 sum of idna and exdna pools genes with the lowest concentration were blactxm 2 1 qnrs 3 1 and teto 3 2 same units as above absolute and normalized concentrations of args and mges and idna vs exdna analysis are shown in fig s9 and table s7 these args concentrations are in agreement with recent studies calderón franco et al 2021 pallares vega et al 2019 and comparable to others especially when considering the variance in sewage and treatment efficiency alexander et al 2020 lee et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the absolute concentration of iargs was significantly higher p 0 05 0 005 than of exargs across all sbr phases and bioaggreagates fig 4a the average idna exdna ratio was 1 9 in the influent and 2 3 in the effluent fig s9 we found a significant reduction p 0 005 after treatment for all genes analyzed by qpcr in the idna fraction in contrast multiple genes such as the bacterial proxy genes 16s rrna and rpob as well as the resistance genes ermb 2 1 log10 gene copies ml 1 higher and sul1 1 0 log10 gene copies ml 1 higher increase from the influent to effluent exdna fig s11 zhang et al 2018 reported an exargs increase of 0 14 1 99 logs in the biological effluent from a wwtp reflecting the persistence and low decay rate of exargs in the discharge water di cesare et al 2016 have reported different args patterns of exargs iargs and integrase mges microbial cell decay and cell lysis can potentially release genetic material extracellularly yu et al 2020 confirmed that exargs were not efficiently removed and were abundant in the final effluents of wwtps highlighting again the concern regarding exdna when considering the control of arg spreading di cesare et al 2016 have reported different args patterns of exargs iargs and integrase mges microbial cell decay and cell lysis can potentially release genetic material extracellularly the free floating exdna is subjected to the fluctuating conditions of the wwtp environment differently than idna li et al 2020 its ability to maintain mobility and be involved in resistance spread needs to be studied in the future small granules accumulated higher concentrations of resistance genes average 0 82 0 31 log10 gene copies log10 16s rrna copies in their idna than big granules 0 62 0 26 or flocs 0 61 0 25 at the end of the aeration no significant differences were observed between granules at the beginning of the aeration figs 4a and s9 it is not clear why small granules accumulated more args during the 9 h aeration process flocs and small granules are more susceptible to immigration from the influent sewage than large granules ali et al 2019 the solid retention time srt of small granules is much shorter 7 7 0 5 days than that of big granules 142 6 14 9 days ali et al 2019 if the influent is enriched with arb immigration can explain a faster loading of args in small than large granules by being more rapidly released out of the tank small granules can play a role in the release and dissemination of args through wwtp effluent than big granules further studies on arg distribution across bioaggregates are needed to determine if args are homogeneously distributed across the cross section of the granules or mainly located at their surface or in one of their layers fluorescent in situ hybridization with arg probes could determine the arg distribution in granule slices such studies will also indicate if transfer between args is more prone to happen between or within granules 3 8 resistance loads in wastewater effluents depend on dna fraction looking at the removal capacity of the full process from influent to effluent the overall pool of resistance determinants was significantly reduced during wwt average 1 1 log10 gene copies ml 1 removal some args were still discharged with idna inside cells 2 4 log10 gene copies g vss 1 and with exdna free floating in water 0 5 3 log10 gene copies ml 1 figs 4a and s9 the majority of the targeted genes decreased after the treatment from the panel analyzed by qpcr inti1 blactxm and teto were significantly p 0 05 removed by 1 3 1 7 and 2 3 log10 gene copies ml 1 respectively the ags process is partially effective at reducing args sabri et al 2020 have reported a similar drop for tetracycline resistance gene tetw in an ags technology of around 2 log10 gene copies ml 1 based on the remaining args concentrations in the effluent an average of 6 3 log10 gene copies ml 1 were released in total idna plus exdna fig 4b taking hospital discharges as references this can be considered high 104 gene copies ml 1 le et al 2016 from fig 4c the normalized values did not significantly enrich bacterial populations carrying args or integrases overall the ags wwtp can reduce the amount of arb but still releases in the environment a significant amount of args enclosed on mges of free floating exdna the commonly overlooked exdna should therefore be considered together with the idna of arb as an important factor in the dissemination of resistance determinants in the aquatic environment risks associated with exdna and idna fractions discharged in water resources need to be evaluated with a clear identification of exposures and effects 4 conclusions this work led to the following main conclusions 1 pseudomonas and rhodoferax populations were the main potential hosts of antibiotic resistance genes args in the biomass other potential arg carrying populations affiliated with acinetobacter aeromonas xanthomonas acidovorax bacteroidetes and streptomyces 2 several args co localized with mobile genetic elements mges on genetic contigs of free floating extracellular dna thus being potentially transferrable to microorganisms the most abundant args co localizing with mges were the beta lactamases resistance gene blavim 48 chloramphenicol resistance gene cmx 1 sulfonamides resistance gene sul2 tetracycline resistance gene teta and aminoglycoside resistance gene aada6 3 the panel of args and inti1 mge analyzed by qpcr were detected in all samples 4 the arg fraction in intracellular dna decreased with 1 1 log10 gene copies ml 1 during the process conversely some args located in the exdna ermb sul1 and sul2 increased during the process 5 according to metagenomics exdna carries args enclosed inside a diversity of mges detected in the wwtp effluent these can potentially spread amr in aquatic environments by horizontal gene transfer therefore studies for the surveillance risk assessment and mitigation of amr in wastewater environments should consider not only idna but also exdna pools data availability metagenome sequencing data were deposited in the ncbi database with the bioproject id prjna783874 credit authorship

15918,in the one health context wastewater treatment plants wwtps are central to safeguarding water resources nonetheless many questions remain about their effectiveness in preventing antimicrobial resistance amr dissemination most surveillance studies monitor the levels and removal of selected antibiotic resistance genes args and mobile genetic elements mges in intracellular dna idna extracted from wwtp influents and effluents the role of extracellular free dna exdna in wastewater is mostly overlooked this study analyzed the transfer of args and mges in a full scale nereda reactor removing nutrients with aerobic granular sludge we tracked the composition and fate of the idna and exdna pools of influent sludge and effluent samples metagenomics was used to profile the microbiome resistome and mobilome signatures of idna and exdna extracts selected args and mges were analyzed by qpcr from 2 840 args identified the genes arr 3 2 tetc 1 6 sul1 1 5 oqxb 1 2 and aph 3 ib 1 2 were the most abundant among all sampling points and bioaggregates pseudomonas acinetobacter aeromonas acidovorax rhodoferax and streptomyces populations were the main potential hosts of args in the sludge in the effluent 478 resistance determinants were detected of which 89 were from exdna potentially released by cell lysis during aeration in the reactor mges and multiple args were co localized on the same extracellular genetic contigs total intracellular args decreased 3 42 due to wastewater treatment however the ermb and sul1 genes increased by 2 and 1 log gene copies ml 1 respectively in exdna from

could increase to 10 million y 1 by 2050 across all income regions under the most alarming scenario no action is taken to contain antimicrobial resistance amr who and un 2019 the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb directly correlates with the widespread use of corresponding antibiotics davies and davies 2010 medically problematic pathogens that acquire multidrug resistance through misuse of antibiotics are bacteria responsible for tuberculosis acute respiratory infections sexually transmitted infections and bacillary dysentery ukuhor 2021 within the one health context wastewater treatment plants wwtps should form a barrier between sewage that transports high loads of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args emitted by anthropogenic metabolisms and aquatic ecosystems bürgmann et al 2018 microorganisms in wwtps biological processes are often considered reservoirs of args while also supposed to contribute to mitigating amr dissemination by degrading antibiotics and amr determinants however current wwtp designs are not optimized to this end currently amr surveillance in wastewater is primarily conducted with molecular biology measurements that target the intracellular dna idna of arb by examining the influent and effluent of 62 dutch wwtps by qpcr pallares vega et al 2019 observed a reduction in the abundance of args and an increase in the relative abundance of resistance plasmids of the incompatibility group 1 incp 1 guo et al 2017 used metagenomics to describe microbiome mobilome and resistome patterns from the idna pool of a chinese wwtp revealing that clostridium and nitrosomonas can carry args during wastewater treatment besides identifying the hosts of args in microbial communities of activated sludge at high resolution it remains primordial to elucidate the mechanisms and mobile genetic elements mges that transfer amr determinants in these populations in addition to idna extracellular free dna exdna contains a high proportion of mges calderón franco et al 2021 different genetic structures and architectures plasmids transposons insertion sequences and integrases among others transfer args between bacteria but many questions remain the analysis of both intracellular args iargs and extracellular args exargs combined with mobilome co localization analysis has rarely been performed in complex environmental samples such as wastewater biomasses such co localization analysis involves the characterization of the resistome fraction in genomic proximity to horizontal gene transfer hgt mediators such as plasmids and other mobile genetic elements slizovskiy et al 2020 apart from the presence of exdna in wastewater not much is known about the actual transfer of amr in the microbiome of wwtps and the underlying effects of biofilms dense microbial aggregations can promote the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes args in aquatic environments abe et al 2020 madsen et al 2012 full scale nereda plants that use aerobic granular sludge ags for an integral removal of nutrients pronk et al 2015 harbor a hybrid sludge composed of granules 0 2 3 mm that have similar properties as biofilms therefore ags sbrs form interesting microbial ecosystems to study the fate of amr metagenomic analysis during granulation at pilot scale showed that args enriched in both idna and exdna fractions of ags during the granule development stage and that integrons played an essential role in carrying exargs li et al 2020 this study analyzed the transfer dynamics of args and mges in a full scale ags nereda plant metagenomic and qpcr analyses were performed on the idna and exdna pools of samples collected from the influent different sludge fractions and the effluent to track transfer phenomena the sludge was sampled over the different sbr phases end of anaerobic feeding end of aeration and sieved for different sized bioaggregates flocs small and big granules the findings highlight the fate of the amr determinants in a full scale ags wwtp and the importance of considering both idna and exdna pools in amr dissemination studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of a full scale ags wwtp the sampling campaign performed on a nereda plant located in utrecht 52 11215 5 10813 the netherlands sampling was performed over 3 days monday wednesday and friday within the same week under dry weather conditions without significant variations in hydraulic retention time 20 h since the sludge retention time was relatively long 30 days in average 40 days for large granules and 10 days for small granules and flocs in this installation the 3 sampling days were considered as biological replicates biological samples were collected every day from pre settled influent wastewater from the mixed liquor at the beginning i e after anaerobic feeding of the wastewater and end of the aeration phase and from the effluent of the sbr fig 1 a total volumes of 1 l of influent and 1 l of effluent were collected as a 24 h flow proportional composite samples for the other process points the sludge was sampled from the top of the tank as grab samples of 1 l with a pole container during the daily operations of the sbr all samples were transported in a cooled container and processed within a time frame of less than 4 h prior to dna extraction the granular sludge samples were sieved in 3 different fractions of bioaggregates flocs 0 2 mm small granules of 0 2 1 mm and large granules 1 mm according to ali et al 2019 the water at the outlet of the sieving unit was used for exdna isolation the fractions of exdna were isolated in a time frame of less than 4 h after sampling the sieved fractions of granular sludge were stored at 20 c in a time frame of less than 4 h after pending isolations of idna in total 12 analytes were obtained and sequenced by metagenomics per sampling day i e 36 analytes for the whole campaign table 1 summarizes the set of samples and analytes 2 2 extractions of exdna and idna analytes the pools of idna and exdna were differentially isolated for all samples as recently described by calderón franco et al 2020 all details can be found in supplementary material 2 3 library preparation sequencing quality control assembly and binning 2 3 1 selection of analytes from the set of 36 analytes of exdna and idna obtained over the 3 days the analytes from the monday and friday i e 24 analytes were selected as duplicates economic optimum for metagenomics these exdna and idna analytes were sent to dnasense aalborg denmark for library preparation and sequencing 2 3 2 preparation of libraries the dna was quantified using qubit thermo fisher scientific usa and fragmented to approximately 550 bp using a covaris m220 with microtube afa fiber screw tubes and the settings duty factor 10 peak displayed power 75 w cycles burst 200 duration 40 s and temperature 20 c the fragmented dna was used for metagenome preparation using the neb next ultra ii dna library preparation kit 2 3 3 sequencing of libraries libraries were sequenced using the hiseq sequencer illumina usa as 2 150 bp paired end reads 2 3 4 quality control of sequence reads after sequencing a dataset containing 48 paired end read samples with an average of 16 million reads per sample was obtained metagenomics workflow is summarized in fig s1 in supplementary information the minimum and maximum numbers of quality filtered non duplicated sequencing reads of 150 bp ranged from 12 to 18 million fig s2 in supplementary information the quality of the illumina reads was assessed using fastqc version 0 11 9 with default parameters andrews 2010 low quality paired ends reads were trimmed and filtered by trimmomatic version 0 39 on paired end mode bolger et al 2014 2 3 5 assembly of sequence reads the trimmed reads were assembled into contigs using metaspades version 3 14 1 nurk et al 2017 on meta mode on default parameters 2 3 6 binning of dna contigs contigs resulting from the sequencing of only the idna pools of bioaggregates were binned with metabat version 2 2 15 kang et al 2019 to reconstruct metagenome assembled genomes mags on default parameters the mags were used to analyze secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters 2 4 generation of the taxonomic database of aerated granular sludge a database of sequences from mags contigs and reads specific to the microbial environment of ags was built to accurately profile the microbiome the kraken 2 0 standard database of 9 1 gbp of genomic sequences wood et al 2019 was used as a basis however because complete genomes of the organisms found in ags systems were often unavailable in the kraken 2 0 database additional genetic fragments specific to some taxa were added to the database as an example abundant genera in ags like tetrasphaera trichococcus and candidatus accumulibacter were not or poorly annotated in the standard database used in kraken2 0 in total 94 005 sequences of 2 223 unique taxa were added to the kraken 2 0 standard database the taxa of the ags samples were classified from both short reads and contig sequences by combining the metaphlan3 0 truong et al 2015 mg rast meyer et al 2018 and kraken2 0 wood et al 2019 computational tools for phylogenetic analysis of metagenomics data with their corresponding databases as well as blastn to align contigs of 1500 bp against the midas database of 16s rrna gene sequences with a cut off e value 10 5 and sequence identity 97 https www midasfieldguide org nierychlo et al 2020 a literature study was conducted in which taxa were added to the database if theoretically present above 1 relative abundance but not present in the database kraken2 0 takes all the sequences added in a selected database and finds k mers short genomic substrings specific for certain taxa for further taxonomic classification the reads full and partial genomes of the predominant taxa were added to the adapted taxonomic database of ags when these lineages were detected above 1 of relative abundance from the metagenomics datasets using one of the previously described classification tool but not present in the kraken2 0 database this was performed on taxonomic levels from phylum to species 2 5 microbiome profiling of idna and exdna pools obtained from the ags process kraken2 0 with short reads as input was selected to profile the microbiome classification with kraken2 0 was performed on pair end mode on the quality controlled short reads using the newly constructed database the taxonomic classification was also performed on contigs 500 bp that were identified to contain args see 2 6 hereafter in order to determine potential args hosts the taxonomic classification outcomes from kraken2 0 were converted into abundance tables using the pavian visualization tool breitwieser and salzberg 2020 to explore metagenomics classification datasets heatmaps were generated with the r package pheatmap kolde 2019 2 6 resistome and mobilome profiling of idna and exdna obtained from the ags process args were annotated by aligning the assembled contigs 500 bp to the resfinder 4 0 resistance gene database using the blastn nucleotide alignment tool with a cut off e value of 10 5 and sequence identity above 90 bortolaia et al 2020 mges were classified on the same set of contigs 500 bp using blastn by aligning them with the same cut off and sequence identity setpoints to the following databases depending to the types of mges bacterial insertion sequences were identified by aligning against the isfinder database siguier et al 2006 integrons integrases and gene cassettes were identified using the integrall database moura et al 2009 bacterial integrative and conjugative elements were identified using the iceberg database liu et al 2019 for all queries the arg or mge identified with the best score i e equal to the sequence identity multiplied by the coverage factor was selected to annotate the query blastn was performed with different databases resfinder 4 0 for args and isfinder integrall and iceberg for mges on the same set of contigs to identify where args and mges co localized blastn was performed with a cut off e value of 10 5 and sequence identity above 90 contigs 500 bp that simultaneously contained hits from the resfinder 4 0 database and at least one of the different mge databases were considered to have co localized the contigs that contained both args and mges were used as input queries against the ncbi plasmid database in order to know if such contig belonged to a plasmid a contig was identified as part of a potential plasmid if exclusively aligning with plasmids in the entire ncbi plasmid database with sequence identities 90 2 7 functional genetic analysis of idna and exdna pools obtained from the sludge prokka version 1 14 5 was used to annotate the assembled contigs 500 bp with the default databases and parameters on metagenomic mode seemann 2014 k numbers were assigned to all predicted coding sequences cdss using ghostkoala after which the kegg database was used for analyse the functional and amr pathways kanehisa et al 2002 seemann 2014 the antibiotics and secondary metabolites analysis shell antismash v5 0 tool was used to identify annotate and analyze the secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters such as involved on antibiotics production in mags binned from the idna bioaggregate samples blin et al 2021 2 8 multidimensional scaling analysis to cluster microbiome and resistome datasets to identify patterns between the microbiome and resistome different types of ordination and statistical numerical methods were performed using the r software the input data was the output of the taxonomic classification from kraken2 0 with the adapted database details can be found in supplementary material the dimensions of the metagenomics datasets were reduced using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds principal coordinates analysis pcoa and t distributed stochastic neighbor embedding t sne these methods were applied to the taxonomic data at phylum and genus levels and to the amr group data for all methods scree plots stress plot and shepard plots were used to visualized the data accurately in two dimensions t sne was applied using the tsne package and a maximum of 2 000 iterations and a perplexity parameter of 5 as input van der maaten and hinton 2008 pcoa t sne and nmds were performed on different taxonomic levels and on the resistome data fig s3 all dimension reductions yielded similar clustering patterns giving equivalent results for each sampling point and sample type pcoa was therefore chosen as representative analysis to characterize the similarities and differences between samples 2 9 quantitative pcr of selected args to evaluate the wwtp performance in terms of removing args and mges to examine their presence during the different process steps and to track their transfer between idna and exdna fractions a molecular analysis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr was applied to detect a selected panel of genes table 2 from the three biological replicates monday wednesday and friday of the samples listed in table 1 all idna and exdna analytes isolated from the three biological sample from the influent beginning and end of aeration and effluent of the sbr were used for qpcr each analyte was measured in technical duplicates by qpcr the 16s rrna and rpob reference genes were quantified for the normalization of gene copies to the concentration of bacteria in the idna samples based on antibiotics consumption data in the netherlands rivm and swab 2020 args were targeted from the antibiotic groups of beta lactams blactxm macrolides ermb fluoroquinolones qnrs sulfonamides sul1 sul2 and tetracyclines teto the inti1 gene encoding the class i integron integrase was quantified these integrase class i cassettes are related to arg mobility acquisition and exchange between microorganisms ma et al 2017 primers thermal cycler conditions and gblocks gene fragments used for standards generation and quantification during qpcr are given in tables s1 s2 and s3 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 taxonomic composition of exdna mainly linked to the granular sludge fraction after taxonomic classification at genus level of the dna contigs assembled from the metagenomic sequencing reads principal coordinates analysis pcoa and other multidimensional scaling methods fig s3 in supplementary material were efficient to observe the clustering effects in data related to the specific sample dna fraction fig 1b the influent samples showed a large difference in composition for both the idna and exdna pools microbial compositions of sewage can vary over an active week based on the variety of emission sources and streams in a wastewater catchment area and environmental factors pallares vega et al 2021 in the effluent a lower variability between the two samples was observed for the idna fraction the taxonomic composition of the idna of the effluent highly resembled the composition of the idna of activated sludge floc fraction in the treatment reactor on the other hand the phylogenetic signatures of the exdna fraction of the effluent showed a larger variation between the samples in the wastewater treatment plant microbial cells can lyse releasing idna as exdna the exdna fractions might not persist as free floating during the whole process it can adhere to particles get degraded or taken up via natural transformation in competent cells dong et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 however we mainly studied the free floating exdna as we hypothesize it would be the main exdna fraction being released in the effluents rather than the attached to particles or aggregates from the different size fractions of bioaggregates in the sludge the microbial community compositions of the small blue in fig 1b and large red granules were similar while the flocs orange clustered separately this is similar as the observations by ali et al 2019 that the floc fraction is more diverse and contains a large number of bacteria originating from the influent wastewater microbial niches establish along gradients of substrates and other dissolved components like oxygen and nitrogen oxides inside bioaggregates winkler et al 2018 the taxonomic affiliations of the exdna sequences of the mixed liquor sampled at the end of aeration were similar to those of the idna extracted from small and large granules rather than the flocs this suggests that exdna was released from the granules by cell lysis during aeration sengar et al 2018 and toh et al 2003 have shown that dead biomass releases its genetic material into the extracellular environment during the ags process in activated sludge yuan et al 2019 have identified that the taxa reflected by the idna and exdna fractions are similar suggesting a correlation between changes in the microbial composition of the activated sludge and in exdna using the same exdna extraction methodology we have shown in a previous study that exdna present in activated sludge mainly originates from decaying microbial populations rather than from transport from the influent calderón franco et al 2021 the taxonomic composition of the exdna fraction in the ags system was mainly related to the microbiome present in the granular sludge 3 2 ags microbiome and potential involvement in amr dissemination the patterns of relative abundances of genera in the different stages of the ags process and in the idna and exdna fractions were examined by constructing a heatmap fig 1c for the clusters observed by pcoa using the standard kraken2 0 database ncbi based 2 548 genera were identified from the whole set of idna and exdna analytes 57 genera were more abundant than 1 of sequencing read counts and 15 of those were predominant above 3 in at least one of the samples fig s4 symbols the average annotation rate of the reads was 24 7 3 2 i e leaving three quarters of the taxonomic information of the reads as to uncover to increase the reads annotation rate a new database of genetic sequences of the ags microbial environment was constructed with this database the average annotation rate was 27 1 3 4 2 679 genera were identified 55 genera were above 1 relative abundance and 21 were above 3 in at least one of the analytes fig s4 although this new annotation rate was only 3 higher than the standard database important ags genera were now identified metagenomic studies can be hindered by low annotation rates as a consequence of the high fraction of natural microbes that have not been included in the databases the current development of databases of high quality mags and properly curated databases will help enhance annotation rates in the future singleton et al 2021 from fig 1 b the exdna taxonomic compositions at the beginning of aeration resembled the exdna from influent while at the end of aeration from both days closely resembled the idna fractions from small and large granules flocs displayed a unique profile while the phylogenic distribution of the effluent exdna resembled the granule phylogeny the effluent idna resembled the flocs from both beginning and end of aeration during the fill draw operation of the sbr flocs leave the tank with the selection spill therefore reducing their retention time in the process guo et al 2020 the diversity of abundant populations in the ags detected by metagenomics is listed in fig 1c several of these populations are involved in the conversions of c n p nutrients in the microbial ecosystem of ags weissbrodt et al 2014 winkler et al 2018 like ca accumulibacter tetrasphaera dechloromonas c p ca competibacter zoogloea xanthomonas rhodoferax pseudomonas acidovorax comamonas rhizobium c n nitrospira n and acinetobacter c among others some relate to filamentous bulking phenomena like ca microthrix bulkholderia nocardioides kouleothrix some thrive on metabolites and lysis products from other organisms like flavobacterium bacteroides and hydrogenophaga among many others the metabolic functions of other organisms in the ags remains to be uncovered less beneficial organisms are arcobacter and aeromonas that are known pathogens arcobacter crosses wwtps from influent to effluent without settling properly kristensen et al 2020 the presence in the influent of exdna affiliating with ca accumulibacter can relate to the recirculation line coming from the sludge thickener among the different populations identified from the ags fig 1c several are known to carry amr related genes acidovorax 3 5 0 6 is a known carrier of beta lactamase resistance plasmids in activated sludge samples zhang et al 2011 rhodoferax 3 5 0 5 has been identified to be of high relative abundance in wastewater effluent while often identified as a carrier of resistance genes zhou et al 2020 nitrospirae 4 1 1 1 may play a role in amr dissemination because it is a known host of iargs and exargs in wwtps zhou et al 2019 guo et al 2017 used metagenomics to identify candidatus accumulibacter 2 1 0 5 as a possible carrier of resistance genes over the wwt operation aeromonas was relatively abundant in all our samples 1 88 0 84 notably the three most critical antibiotic resistant pathogens as designated by the world health organization are acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae tacconelli and magrini 2017 acinetobacter and pseudomonas were abundant across samples figs 1c and s4 we suggest that recovering and annotating mags for these populations out of ags biomass could help identify whether they harbour pathogenic traits or not interestingly the relative abundances of exdna sequences affiliating with the genera candidatus microthrix exdna at beginning of aeration 0 5 0 1 vs at end of aeration 5 6 2 0 acidovorax 1 2 0 1 vs 4 3 0 2 rhodoferax 1 8 0 2 vs 7 9 1 3 and zoogloea 0 8 0 2 vs 2 6 0 5 increased over the aeration period these filamentous bacteria ca microthrix and denitrifiers were abundant 3 in the granule fractions of the sbr but not in flocs these microbial populations are known to populate ags used for full biological nutrient removal winkler et al 2018 the presence of exdna in the water phase can relate to cell lysis or to active release from the cells acinetobacter idna 6 1 2 8 exdna 3 4 2 2 flavobacterium 1 2 0 4 1 0 0 5 and pseudomonas 4 3 0 9 4 0 1 1 secrete dna in the extracellular environment during growth in liquid media pietramellara et al 2009 collectively we had identified the main microbial players in the granular sludge microbiome and the relationship with exdna fractions and the possible involvement in the dissemination of resistance determinants further mechanistic insights using well controlled experiments with systems microbiology methods are required to identify whether cell decay or active secretion can explain the release of exdna from microorganisms of the sludge 3 3 a wide range of args are present in the effluent exdna the resistome of wastewater systems exhibits a large diversity of args as many as 2 840 args were identified from all the samples belonging to 15 antibiotic subgroups args affiliating with mls macrolide lincosamide and streptogramin n 910 reads aminoglycosides n 598 reads sulphonamides n 375 reads beta lactam n 330 reads and tetracycline n 233 reads were the most abundant fig 2 a the resistome profiles matched with hendriksen et al 2019 macrolides are the most abundant args in urban sewage in europe followed by aminoglycosides and beta lactams all samples including the different types of bioaggregates and idna and exdna fractions contained args the exdna resistome profiles at beginning and end of aeration resembled the idna resistomes of granules similar to observations made on taxonomic affiliations of exdna sequences exargs mainly originated from the granules rather than from flocs in the effluent exdna was a combination of fragments coming from the influent idna fig 2b being in the day 2 part of the bigger dendogram plus the different bioaggregates the 5 most abundant args over all samples were aminoglycoside arr 3 gene n 58 reads tetracycline tet c n 46 reads sulfonamide sul1 n 44 reads multidrug efflux pump oqxb n 34 reads and aminoglycoside aph 3 ib n 34 reads taken together n 216 reads these genes only amount to 7 6 of the total args identified this high diversity of resistance genes matches with another metagenomic analysis of activated sludge samples zhou et al 2019 of all 478 args identified in the effluent 89 were carried by exdna this can present a risk for amr dissemination in the environment and for health by natural transformation of exdna fragments in microorganisms present in receiving water bodies and drinking water resources especially for the resistance determinants to the last resource antibiotics such as carbapenem and colistin the types of exarg and iarg were similar matching with zhou et al 2019 in contrast using pcr only li et al 2020 detected dissimilar compositions of iargs and exargs during sludge granulation at pilot scale early stage granulation is a dynamic process involving changing community compositions along the establishment of physicochemical gradients e g increasing anaerobic zones in granules sengar et al 2018 this can lead to bacteria decay and dna release shifts over the process therefore leading to variations in arg profiles as well here mature granules from the full scale ags wwtp were used to track the fate of args under pseudo steady state conditions overall the effluent exdna is an overlooked dna fraction that needs to be considered for future risk analysis it is a highly diverse fraction regarding antibiotic resistance genes 3 4 gram negative bacteria are potential carriers of args in the ags all contigs 500 bp containing args were taxonomically classified to identify which microorganisms carried and potentially released args figs 2b and s4 as high as 98 of contigs containing args were annotated with taxonomy a contig affiliated to a taxon does not necessarily mean that the read comes from that specific organism different populations can share similar arg sequences the contigs containing args over the whole metagenomic dataset of all samples and fractions were affiliated to gram negative genera like pseudomonas 8 4 0 7 rhodoferax 5 6 0 9 acinetobacter 4 3 1 4 aeromonas 3 1 1 1 xanthomonas 3 9 0 9 and acidovorax 1 9 0 4 as well as the gram positive and antibiotic producing genus streptomyces 1 6 0 4 fig s4 pseudomonas and rhodoferax genera s high abundance pattern were similar between the two sampling days fig 2b idna contigs containing args in small and large granules were affiliated at several instances to rhodoferax 10 1 0 4 in granules out of the contigs where args were localized the arg containing exdna affiliated to rhodoferax beginning of aeration 2 0 0 5 end of aeration 11 0 2 9 this increase suggests that dna was released from rhodoferax cells during aeration rhodoferax is abundant in wwtp effluents and often identified as amr carriers by encoding multiple efflux pumps jin et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 args have been identified from mags retrieved from activated sludge from danish wwtps miłobedzka et al 2022 singleton et al 2021 rhodoferax was the most abundant population containing multiple args the effluent idna is mainly composed of microorganisms that go through the process without being removed from bacteria growing on suspended solids and of microorganisms detached from the ags bioaggregates some microorganisms that entered the ags plant in high abundance and passed through the wwtp are aeromonas and acinetobacter especially in day 1 the effluent was enriched by microorganisms coming mainly from floccular sludge such as lysobacter both days and thermomonas day 2 fig 2b pathogenic arcobacter crossed wwtps from influent to effluent fig 1c but interestingly no arg was detected in any of arcobacter contigs further research needs to be done to clearly identify which args in which mges are inside specific microbial hosts recent analytical advances now allow to identify potential hosts of resistances using hi c sequencing stalder et al 2019 populations of aeromonadaceae moraxellaceae and bacteroidetes were shown to be critical reservoirs of amr in wwtps the resistome results highlight that amr determinants released in exdna during the wastewater operation are importantly linked to gram negative bacteria notably rhodoferax and to potential pathogenic bacterial genera carrying args in the effluent such as pseudomonas and aeromonas 3 5 mges and args often co localize on contigs recovered from the exdna of the effluent both idna and exdna fractions and all bioaggregates were sources of a diversity of mges the different samples yielded 55 344 different mges belonging to bacterial insertion sequences 9 845 reads integrons integrases and gene cassettes 20 149 reads and bacterial integrative conjugative elements 25 350 reads when args and mges co localize on the same genetic fragment there is an increased chance that the fragment can be transferred between bacterial cells since mges facilitate the transfer integration and transposition of genes in genomes this poses a clear risk for arg dissemination from all contigs 500 bp 312 contigs were identified to contain both args and mges table s6 their 5 most abundant args were blavim 48 28 cmx 1 28 sul2 25 teta 24 and aada6 24 a set of 80 contigs contained multiple args and of these 60 also contained mges their 5 most abundant args were all aminoglycoside resistance genes namely aph 3 ib 17 aada6 17 aph 6 id 17 aada11 7 and aac 3 ib 7 multiple co localization patterns were detected only in the idna of granules and in the exdna of the effluent for instance sul2 and teta were exclusively found in the idna from large granules replicate 2 from the end of the aeration and in the effluent exdna fraction replicate 2 this contig also aligned with isvsa3 an insertion sequence often found on plasmids toleman and walsh 2010 of the 60 contigs 500bp were multiple args and mges co localized 3 major groups of contigs are highlighted hereafter because of their abundance in the system or the risk associated with leaving the wwtp in the exdna of the effluent firstly as shown in table s6 15 contigs were identified both as carriers of two aminoglycoside resistance genes aph 3 ib and aph 6 id and as part of transposon tn5393 fig 3 a these contigs were found in all samples across wwt operation for all microbial aggregates and exdna and idna fractions excluding the flocs after alignment to the ncbi nucleotide database the contigs aligned with incq plasmids mostly from populations of acinetobacter and pseudomonas genera previously identified in our wastewater samples incq plasmids are significant since they are related to the broadest host range of all replicating elements in bacteria meyer 2009 they are known to mobilize via conjugation although natural transformation has also been observed bönemann et al 2006 meyer 2009 szczepanowski et al 2009 2004 ellison et al 2018 have proven that double stranded exdna can directly be captured by natural competent bacteria such as the model organisms vibrio cholerae via retraction of dna bound type iv competent pili then 18 contigs aligned with a tn3 family transposon tnas3 normally encoding a β lactamase gene a transposase and a resolvase nicolas et al 2015 as identified from the exdna effluent fraction fig 3b these contigs identities 95 aligned exclusively with plasmids from escherichia coli klebsiella pneumoniae pseudomonas aeruginosa enterobacter cloacae enterobacter kobei and klebsiella oxytoca interestingly of all pathogens the world health organization stressed that addressing carbapenem resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae should have the highest priority tacconelli and magrini 2017 finally another contig of importance found in the exdna fraction of the effluent carried multiple resistance genes against aminoglycosides aac 6 beta lactamases blaoxa 10 and phenicols cmla1 fig 3c this contig aligned with a 100 sequence identity to a plasmid already annotated from aeromonas hydrophila pwcx23 1 carrying 15 different args nwaiwu and aduba 2020 the strong presence of mobilized resistance determinants in the extracellular fraction of the ags wwtp has been also described by ikuma and rehmann 2020 using mathematical modelling they suggested that at the wwtp effluent discharge point in a river the total number count of args was 13 times higher when including exargs on top of iargs collectively exargs in wwtp discharges need to be taken into account for accurate risk assessments of amr co localization studies are valuable tools to identify the genetic structures and potential hosts by which resistance determinants are carried and transferred between bacteria more research needs to be conducted to reconstruct full plasmids from wastewater effluents this will shed light on the type of plasmids released into the environment i e narrow broad range and synthetic naturally occurring and on the genetic constructions args are embedded in multiple args often co localize with mges on contigs from all the sampling points the effluent is one of the predominant pool of mges containing args across the wastewater treatment chain 3 6 no antibiotic related biosynthetic gene clusters were found in the biomass for the most abundant arg identified functional and pathway analyses were performed on the contigs to identify amr pathways and on the mags to identify potential intrinsic antibiotic production by microorganisms that could promote the development and survival of arb in ags systems from all the amr pathways available in the kegg database kanehisa et al 2002 we identified the cationic antimicrobial peptide camp resistance pathway vancomycin resistance pathway and beta lactamase resistance pathway including efflux pumps that actively transport the beta lactam antibiotics out of the cell rnd efflux pumps figs s6 s8 both influent and effluent idna and exdna were sources of genes involved in beta lactam resistance most genes involved in these resistance pathways were present in the influent idna but not in the influent exdna however in the effluent both idna and exdna contained resistance pathways genes from the antismash analysis of mags recovered from small and large granules no mags could be recovered from flocs due to the sequencing depth and short reads used at the end of aeration positive hits on non ribosomal peptide synthetase nrps biosynthetic gene clusters bgcs were detected in mags of nitrospira and janthinobacterium nrps antibiotics include vancomycin polymyxin and teixobactin which are highly effective against multidrug resistant bacteria li et al 2018 the vancomycin resistance pathway was one of the few reconstructed pathways in the samples analyzed fig s6 terpenes indoles t1pks and ectoine bgcs were identified as the most recurrent table s11 no aminoglycosides or beta lactams antibiotic bgcs were found in any of the dna samples from the functional analysis of mags we did not recover full antibiotic production pathways from the main populations identified and that relate to the most abundant args present during the process 3 7 ags treatment is efficient at reducing the load of resistance determinants while some exargs increased over the wwt operation to quantify the arg and arb occurrence and related removal capacity of the ags wwtp a panel of six args and inti1 as mge were quantified by qpcr two normalization methods using 16s rrna and rpob genes were assessed both the args and the mge were consistently detected across all the ags process phases and bioaggregates the most predominant genes throughout the process were the sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 and the class 1 integron gene inti1 fig 4 a these genes were the most concentrated ones in the effluent with 7 5 sul1 and 7 0 inti1 log10 gene copies ml 1 sum of idna and exdna pools genes with the lowest concentration were blactxm 2 1 qnrs 3 1 and teto 3 2 same units as above absolute and normalized concentrations of args and mges and idna vs exdna analysis are shown in fig s9 and table s7 these args concentrations are in agreement with recent studies calderón franco et al 2021 pallares vega et al 2019 and comparable to others especially when considering the variance in sewage and treatment efficiency alexander et al 2020 lee et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the absolute concentration of iargs was significantly higher p 0 05 0 005 than of exargs across all sbr phases and bioaggreagates fig 4a the average idna exdna ratio was 1 9 in the influent and 2 3 in the effluent fig s9 we found a significant reduction p 0 005 after treatment for all genes analyzed by qpcr in the idna fraction in contrast multiple genes such as the bacterial proxy genes 16s rrna and rpob as well as the resistance genes ermb 2 1 log10 gene copies ml 1 higher and sul1 1 0 log10 gene copies ml 1 higher increase from the influent to effluent exdna fig s11 zhang et al 2018 reported an exargs increase of 0 14 1 99 logs in the biological effluent from a wwtp reflecting the persistence and low decay rate of exargs in the discharge water di cesare et al 2016 have reported different args patterns of exargs iargs and integrase mges microbial cell decay and cell lysis can potentially release genetic material extracellularly yu et al 2020 confirmed that exargs were not efficiently removed and were abundant in the final effluents of wwtps highlighting again the concern regarding exdna when considering the control of arg spreading di cesare et al 2016 have reported different args patterns of exargs iargs and integrase mges microbial cell decay and cell lysis can potentially release genetic material extracellularly the free floating exdna is subjected to the fluctuating conditions of the wwtp environment differently than idna li et al 2020 its ability to maintain mobility and be involved in resistance spread needs to be studied in the future small granules accumulated higher concentrations of resistance genes average 0 82 0 31 log10 gene copies log10 16s rrna copies in their idna than big granules 0 62 0 26 or flocs 0 61 0 25 at the end of the aeration no significant differences were observed between granules at the beginning of the aeration figs 4a and s9 it is not clear why small granules accumulated more args during the 9 h aeration process flocs and small granules are more susceptible to immigration from the influent sewage than large granules ali et al 2019 the solid retention time srt of small granules is much shorter 7 7 0 5 days than that of big granules 142 6 14 9 days ali et al 2019 if the influent is enriched with arb immigration can explain a faster loading of args in small than large granules by being more rapidly released out of the tank small granules can play a role in the release and dissemination of args through wwtp effluent than big granules further studies on arg distribution across bioaggregates are needed to determine if args are homogeneously distributed across the cross section of the granules or mainly located at their surface or in one of their layers fluorescent in situ hybridization with arg probes could determine the arg distribution in granule slices such studies will also indicate if transfer between args is more prone to happen between or within granules 3 8 resistance loads in wastewater effluents depend on dna fraction looking at the removal capacity of the full process from influent to effluent the overall pool of resistance determinants was significantly reduced during wwt average 1 1 log10 gene copies ml 1 removal some args were still discharged with idna inside cells 2 4 log10 gene copies g vss 1 and with exdna free floating in water 0 5 3 log10 gene copies ml 1 figs 4a and s9 the majority of the targeted genes decreased after the treatment from the panel analyzed by qpcr inti1 blactxm and teto were significantly p 0 05 removed by 1 3 1 7 and 2 3 log10 gene copies ml 1 respectively the ags process is partially effective at reducing args sabri et al 2020 have reported a similar drop for tetracycline resistance gene tetw in an ags technology of around 2 log10 gene copies ml 1 based on the remaining args concentrations in the effluent an average of 6 3 log10 gene copies ml 1 were released in total idna plus exdna fig 4b taking hospital discharges as references this can be considered high 104 gene copies ml 1 le et al 2016 from fig 4c the normalized values did not significantly enrich bacterial populations carrying args or integrases overall the ags wwtp can reduce the amount of arb but still releases in the environment a significant amount of args enclosed on mges of free floating exdna the commonly overlooked exdna should therefore be considered together with the idna of arb as an important factor in the dissemination of resistance determinants in the aquatic environment risks associated with exdna and idna fractions discharged in water resources need to be evaluated with a clear identification of exposures and effects 4 conclusions this work led to the following main conclusions 1 pseudomonas and rhodoferax populations were the main potential hosts of antibiotic resistance genes args in the biomass other potential arg carrying populations affiliated with acinetobacter aeromonas xanthomonas acidovorax bacteroidetes and streptomyces 2 several args co localized with mobile genetic elements mges on genetic contigs of free floating extracellular dna thus being potentially transferrable to microorganisms the most abundant args co localizing with mges were the beta lactamases resistance gene blavim 48 chloramphenicol resistance gene cmx 1 sulfonamides resistance gene sul2 tetracycline resistance gene teta and aminoglycoside resistance gene aada6 3 the panel of args and inti1 mge analyzed by qpcr were detected in all samples 4 the arg fraction in intracellular dna decreased with 1 1 log10 gene copies ml 1 during the process conversely some args located in the exdna ermb sul1 and sul2 increased during the process 5 according to metagenomics exdna carries args enclosed inside a diversity of mges detected in the wwtp effluent these can potentially spread amr in aquatic environments by horizontal gene transfer therefore studies for the surveillance risk assessment and mitigation of amr in wastewater environments should consider not only idna but also exdna pools data availability metagenome sequencing data were deposited in the ncbi database with the bioproject id prjna783874 credit authorship

15919,the generation of organic matter om occurs synchronously with phytoplankton growth characterization of the generated particulate and dissolved om during algal blooms in eutrophic lakes is crucial for better understanding the carbon cycle but remains limited we speculate that sediments play a critical role in the biogeochemical transformation of om derived from algal blooms in shallow lakes in this study changes in om quantity and quality and the concentrations of biogenic elements nutrients and metals during algal blooms were studied in situ in a shallow eutrophic lake lake chaohu china two enclosure treatments in the presence and absence of sediments were compared and the cause effect relationships among sediment nutrients metals phytoplankton particulate om pom and dissolved om dom were revealed by a partial least square path model pls pm the results showed that the changes in nutrients and metals concentrations over time were consistent with that of chlorophyll a chl a and at the end of the treatment the concentrations of chl a nutrients and metals in treatment s with sediments were approximately 3 5 times of those in treatment n without sediments the high concentration of chl a in treatment s resulted in a high quantity of pom which showed low molecular weight low humification and was enriched in protein like components 70 for dom the quantity increased after the decrease in pom and dom quality showed a significantly higher abundance of humic like components and a higher molecular weight than pom did the pls pm results showed that the significant positive effects of sediment on nutrients metals phytoplankton pom and dom were 0 28 0 37 0 28 0 25 and 0 25 respectively suggesting that sediment had an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of these substances the significant negative relationship between pom and dom 0 62 and the distinct difference in pom and dom quality implied the efficient transformation of the freshly generated om to those with a higher molecular weight higher humification and potentially refractory our results depicted the quick biogeochemical transformation of nutrients metals and the potential formation of refractory organic carbon in water column as driven by the couple of the algae pump with the microbial carbon pump graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biogeochemical transformation algal bloom sediment organic matter humic like substance refractory dissolved organic matter 1 introduction under the scenarios of climate change and intensive anthropogenic activity eutrophication and the subsequent occurrence of algal blooms in aquatic ecosystems have become a global environmental problem beaulieu et al 2013 o neil et al 2012 paerl and paul 2012 outbreaks of algal blooms have negative effects on the biodiversity and functioning of aquatic food webs and threaten the use of affected water for drinking water bathing fishing and other recreational uses huisman et al 2018 several strategies i e the reduction of nutrient loading hydrodynamic changes and chemical or biological control have been developed to prevent and suppress algal blooms copetti et al 2016 jeppesen et al 2005 parel and otten 2013 among these control strategies the reduction of nutrient loading is essential to solve the problem however the release of phosphorus p from sediments in shallow lakes often sustains eutrophication long after the reduction of external loading from the watershed retarding the restoration of eutrophic lakes scheffer and jeppesen 2007 differed to the stratification of deep lake shallow lakes are usually well mixed and has the homogenous temperature and dissolved oxygen do throughout the water column thus the frequent exchange of the substances could happen between the sediment and the water column søndergaard et al 2003 in shallow lakes the positive feedback between algal blooms and the release of p from sediments had been found algal blooms have been suggested to perform like a pump and induce a massive release of p from the sediments due to the increase in ph and the decrease in the redox potential of the lake water cao et al 2016 xie et al 2003 not only p the release of the other biogenic elements such as iron fe and nitrogen n from the sediment was enhanced during the algal bloom chen et al 2018 reported the accompanying release of fe with p due to their close association and the increasing release flux of nitrogen n was driven due to the constrain of nitrification denitrification couple by the elevated ph during algal blooms gao et al 2012 thus we expect that in shallow eutrophic water algal blooms could induce a strong role on the biogeochemical cycle of these elements including p n and other metal elements the fixation of inorganic carbon to organic carbon in the form of om via photosynthesis during phytoplankton growth and the subsequent transformation of om are other important aspects of the elements biogeochemical cycles during algal blooms the major constituents of phytoplankton cells are proteins carbohydrates and lipids myklestad 2000 extracellular exudation or cell lysis releases algae derived dom which is highly bioavailable and can be transformed by bacterial metabolism bittar et al 2015 teeling et al 2012 lab scale studies have shown the consumption of algae derived dom and the reproduction of dom with a distinct composition by bacteria bittar et al 2015 romera castillo et al 2011 during the microbial transfromation it was found that the tryptophan like component in algae derived dom was effectively consumed while the microbially derived humic like component accumulated bai et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 however information from in situ experiments on the carbon biogeochemical cycle during algal blooms is limited in this study we performed in situ enclosure experiments in a shallow eutrophic lake lake chaohu china focusing on i the production and transformation of the organic matter pom and dom during the algal bloom and ii the roles of sediments in providing essential elements to support the growth of phytoplankton and in om transformation we hypothesized that i as an active bio pump an algal bloom mobilizes massive amounts of biogenic elements not only n p but also metals e g fe and cu from sediment and ii algal growth will be accelerated in the presence of sediment resulting in the formation of a large amount of algae derived om which would be subsequently transformed by bacteria in this study the composition of initial algae derived om was referred by that of the collected pom because of the substantial phytoplankton biomass in the enclosures and based on results from the previous incubation experiments on the transformation of algae derived om which were discussed above the composition of dom in lake water consisted of both algae derived dom and those produced from the subsequent processing of the algae derived om therefore the difference in the composition of pom and dom in lake water could be due to the microbial transformation we used a partial least square path model pls pm to reveal the relationships among the variables of sediment nutrients metals phytoplankton pom and dom the results is helpful to elucidate the biogeochemical cycle of carbon during the algal bloom in shallow lakes 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection a 13 day in situ enclosure experiment was conducted in august 2015 in lake chaohu 31 25 31 43 n 117 5 117 16 e which is the fifth largest freshwater lake in china with a surface area of 760 km2 and a mean depth of 2 69 m rapid industrialization and urbanization since the 1980s have led to the eutrophication of lake chaohu zhang and kong 2015 cyanobacterial blooms occurred throughout the lake from may to november each year and cyanobacteria mainly microcystis spp reached 88 99 of the total phytoplankton biomass zhang et al 2015 on august 5th 2015 four enclosures length width height of 5 0 m 5 0 m 3 5 m were set up near the shore of lake chaohu the four enclosures were made of polyethylene two enclosures t1 and t2 were bottom free and contained the sediments treatment with sediments treatment s the other two t3 and t4 had the bottom side and the sediments were excluded treatment with no sediments treatment n to explore the effect of the original biomass of cyanobacteria on the biogeochemical transformation of elements 150 l of fresh cyanobacteria concentrates collected from the lake water outside of the enclosures were added to two enclosures t2 and t4 while no cyanobacteria concentrates were added in the other two enclosures t1 and t3 the initial chl a concentrations t 0 d in the surface water of the enclosures with and without the addition of fresh cyanobacteria were 22 336 µg l mean value in t2 and t4 and 15 822 mean value in t1 and t3 respectively when t 3 d the chl a concentrations in t1 and t3 were similar to those in t2 and t4 respectively due to in situ growth of cyanobacteria thus the difference in the original chl a concentrations between t1 t2 and t3 t4 was regarded to have negligible effects in our experiments samples were collected at 1 3 6 8 10 12 and 13 d both surface water at a depth of 0 0 5 m and bottom water at a depth of 2 5 3 0 m were collected in 10 l acid cleaned high density polyethylene bottles

to collect pom to characterize the composition of pom algae derived om pom was extracted by naoh following the procedures reported in the literature osburn et al 2012 and the pom extract was then characterized by optical measurements see section 2 4 extraction by naoh is a conventional method to extract the extracellular polymeric substances secreted by cyanobacteria sheng et al 2005 xu et al

reduce the matrix data into discrete components with different source compositional characteristics stedmon and bro 2008 the model with 112 eems 56 eems of dom and 56 eems of pom extract generated the fluorescence intensity fmax unit r u of five components for each sample the five eem parafac components identified by the model were submitted to the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 for source assignment the total fluorescence intensity ftotal was calculated as the sum of the fluorescence intensities of five parafac components in addition a series of optical indices e2 e3 fluorescence index fi humification index hix and autotrophic productivity bix were calculated to evaluate the quality of dom and pom extract and their calculation and interpretation are provided in table s1 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed in r 3 6 3 r core team 2020 and plotted using the r package ggplot2 differences in quality indices between dom and pom between were examined by using the non parametric kruskal wallis with dunn post hoc test dunn test package the influence of sediment time and their interaction fixed effects on the response variables including concentrations of chl a nutrients and metals pom quantity and dom quantity was studied using generalized linear mixed model glmm bolker et al 2009 we fitted five candidate models fix effects sediment time sediment time sediment time and null using the glmmtmb function from the glmmtmb package brooks et al 2017 enclosure identity t1 and t2 t3 and t4 was used as a random effect the model of sediment time had three independent terms of sediment time also their interaction term the model of sediment time had two independent terms of sediment and time and models of sediment and time only had one independent term of sediment and time respectively the model of null had no independent term the best model was selected based on the lowest akaike information criterion value from the default anova function principal component analysis pca was performed to visualize the statistical differences in the quality between pom and dom pca was conducted using function princomp and the variables were centered and scaled before the analysis the predictors for om quality were the optical indices of e2 e3 hix bix and fi and the relative abundance of eem parafac components c1 c5 pls pm was employed to quantify the underlying cause effect relationships among sediment nutrients metals phytoplankton pom quantity and dom quantity this method is known as the partial least squares approach to structural equation modeling and allows the estimation of complex cause effect relationship models with latent variables thus the method is particularly suitable for multivariate data such as those in this study chen et al 2021b du et al 2021 wang et al 2016 pls pm analysis was performed using the r package plspm the full path model comprises two submodels the inner model structural model and the outer model measurement model sanchez 2013 the inner model demonstrated the cause effect relationships among the six latent variables fig s1 the establishment of the inner model was based on the experimental results also the possible mechanism to describe the cause effect relationships among sediment nutrients metals phytoplankton pom quantity and dom quality the supply of nutrients and metals from the sediment which were taken up by the phytoplankton the growth of phytoplankton directly resulted in the carbon fixation and thus pom formation while the production of dom was from the bacteria metabolism of pom and the nutrients and metals could have a role on the bacteria metabolism the outer model is part of the model that describes the relationships between each latent variable and the corresponding reflective indicators the loadings of the indicators on the latent variable were calculated as their correlations which indicated the dependence of the latent variable on the indicators sanchez 2013 the reflective indicators for each latent variable are presented in supplementary table s2 3 results 3 1 changes in chl a nutrients and metals concentrations with time in treatment s and treatment n cyanobacteria possess gas vesicles which enable living cyanobacteria to float upward huisman et al 2018 therefore the concentrations of chl a nutrients and metals in the surface and bottom waters were investigated separately 3 1 1 chl a concentrations in surface water the model selection by using a glmm showed a significant interaction effect of sediment and time on chl a concentrations fig 1 a table s3 the concentrations of chl a were higher in treatment s than in treatment n fig 1 a the positive values of the coefficients i e 5472 table s3 of the interactive effect suggested that the difference in chl a concentrations between treatment s and treatment n increased with reaction time model selection by using glmm for chl a concentrations in the bottom water also showed a significant interaction effect between sediment and time fig 1 b table s3 contrary to those in the surface water the concentrations of chl a were lower in treatment s than in treatment n the negative values of the coefficients i e 25 9 table s3 suggested that a negative difference chl a concentrations in the treatment s minus those in treatment n increased with time notably the order of magnitude 3 5 for chl a concentrations in the surface water is much higher than that 1 2 in the bottom water 3 1 2 nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the surface water model selection showed a significant positive interaction effect of sediment and time on the concentrations of tn tp dtn nh4 n and po4 3 p fig 1 a table s3 which was the same as that for chl a concentrations in the surface water for other species of nutrients model selection by glmm showed a significant positive effect of sediment on dtp concentrations and no significant differences in no3 and no2 concentrations between treatment s and treatment n were found table s3 in the bottom water model selection by glmm showed a marginally significant interactive effect of sediment and time on tp and dtp concentrations p 0 076 fig 1 b table s3 tp and dtp concentrations were lower in treatment s than in treatment n and the negative values treatment s minus treatment n enlarged with time fig 1 b the effects of sediment and time on nitrogen concentrations were different among the different species of nitrogen model selection showed a significant effect of sediment treatment on tn concentrations and a significant effect of time on dtn no3 and nh4 concentrations table s3 3 1 3 metals concentrations in surface water model selection by glmm showed a significant interaction effect of sediment and time on tfe tal and tcu concentrations fig 1 a table s3 the concentrations of tfe tal and tcu in treatment s were higher than those treatment n and the difference between the two treatments enlarged with the time model selection showed that the presence of sediments had a positive significant effect on the total dissolved fe tdfe concentrations but had no effect on the total concentrations of dissolved al and cu tdal and tdcu for ferrous ions concentrations no significant effect of the presence of sediment or time was observed fig 1 a table s3 in the bottom water model selection by glmm showed a significant interaction effect of sediment and time on the concentrations of tfe tal tcu and ferrous ion fig 1 b table s3 in contrast with the situation in surface water the concentrations of tfe tal and tcu in treatment s were lower than those in treatment n which was obvious beyond t 8 d for the concentrations of the total dissolved metals model selection by glmm showed a significant effect of sediments on tdfe but not on tdal and tdcu fig 1 b table s3 the discrepancy in chl a nutrients and metals concentrations between treatment s and treatment n showed contrary phenomenon in the surface water and bottom water in surface water the matter concentrations were higher in treatment s than those in treatment n and vice versa in the bottom water to measure the discrepancy in the concentrations of chl a nutrients and metals between treatment s and treatment n the concentrations of matter in the enclosures at t 13 d were calculated as the mean values of the concentrations in the surface water and bottom water cmean the effect of the sediments on the matter concentrations was quantified as the ratio of cmean sed to cmean nosed cmean sed cmean nosed table 1 the concentrations of chl a tn tp tal tfe tcu dtn and dtp in treatment s were approximately 3 5 times of those in treatment n the ratios of cmean sed cmean nosed for tdal and tdfe were low as 1 2 1 6 and those for tdcu and ferrous ion were 0 8 and 0 3 respectively table 1 3 2 changes in pom and dom composition with time in treatment s and treatment n five eem parafac components were identified fig 2 and table 2 component 1 c1 an excitation maximum at 295 nm and an emission maximum at 378 nm represents a microbially derived humic like substance gueguen et al 2015 component 3 c3 excitation emission maximum 260 360 442 nm is assigned as a humic like substance which is regarded as mainly from terrestrial sources sharma et al 2017 component 2 c2 excitation emission maximum 275 332 nm is a protein like component and component 4 c4 excitation emission 280 352 nm and component 5 c5 excitation emission maximum 275 304 nm are tryptophan like and tyrosine like components respectively 3 2 1 pom quantity and quality chromophoric om a254 pom a280 pom and a350 pom and fluorescent om parafac components of c1 pom c5 pom in the pom extract were used to determine the pom quantity in general the changes in pom quantity with time fig 3 and table s4 were consistent with those of chl a in the corresponding treatment because the formation of pom was driven by the growth of cyanobacteria there were significant positive interaction effects of sediment and time on the pom quantity in the surface water but negative significant interaction effects in the bottom water that is in the surface water the pom quantity was higher in treatment s than those in treatment n but in the bottom water pom quantity was lower in treatment s than those in treatment n in addition the difference in pom quantity between the two treatments increased with time at the end of the experiment the concentrations of the different components of pom in treatment s were approximately 3 6 times those in treatment n except for c1 pom 1 5 times table 1 for all pom the relative abundance of the five parafac components was c5 pom 47 1 24 c4 pom 24 1 8 8 c2 pom 12 4 14 6 c3 pom 8 6 5 6 c1 pom 7 8 5 2 the most abundant parafac component was c5 pom tyrosine like substance followed by c4 pom tryptophan like substance the value for the e2 e3 of pom was 22 4 17 7 hix was 0 68 0 57 bix was 0 85 0 32 and fi was 2 61 0 54 indicating that pom was dominated by the low molecular weight and low aromatic content compound 3 2 2 dom quantity and quality the effects of sediment and time on dom quantity are shown in fig 3 and table s4 that is in the surface water dom quantity was higher in treatment s than those in treatment n on the contrary in the bottom water dom quantity was lower in treatment s than those in treatment n both in the surface water and in the bottom water the difference in dom quantity between treatment s and treatment n increased over time for all dom the relative abundance was c2 dom 53 10 3 c1 dom 20 2 13 8 c5 dom 11 6 6 8 c3 dom 11 4 3 5 c4 dom 3 8 4 2 the value for the e2 e3 was 4 41 2 58 hix was 0 88 0 39 bix was 1 03 0 41 and fi was 2 38 0 31 for dom 3 2 3 comparison in quality between pom and dom the time series of dom in the surface water showed that in treatment s dom remained unchanged at the beginning of 7 d and then increased after 10 d dom decreased fig 3 the change in dom quantity with time in treatment s was opposite to that in pom i e pom decreased during days 7 10 and then increased this meant that the lysis or secretion of cyanobacterial cell released dom which underwent subsequent transformation in treatment s dom showed a significantly higher c1 c2 and c3 but lower c4 and c5 than pom as well as a higher hix value but lower e2 e3 and fi values fig 4 in treatment n dom also showed a significantly higher c1 c2 and e2 e3 but a lower c4 and c5 than pom did but no significant differences were found in c3 hix or fi values between dom and pom in treatment n pca analysis fig 5 based on the om quality the optical indices e2 e3 fi hix and bix and the relative abundance of parafac component c1 c5 showed that the situation of pom and dom samples was almost opposite pc1 and pc2 explained 40 8 and 25 8 of the variation in om quality respectively c1 c3 and hix were situated at the positive direction of pc1 and c4 c5 and e2 e3 were situated at the negative direction of pc1 all dom samples were situated in the positive pc1 direction whereas the major pom samples were situated in the negative pc1 direction the presence of sediment had minor influence on om quality the circle for pom samples in treatment s situated at a more negative position of pc1 than that in treatment n 3 3 pls pm this study showed that in general 1 similar changes with time in concentrations of nutrients and metals pom quantity to that of chl a and the concentrations of chl a nutrients metals pom and dom quantity were substantially influenced by the presence of sediments 2 the opposite change tendency with time was found between dom quantity and pom quantity the results of the pls pm model fig 6 table 3 showed the relationships among sediment nutrients metals phytoplankton pom quantity and dom quantity the total effects of the sediment on nutrients metals and phytoplankton were 0 28 0 37 and 0 28 respectively the total effects of sediments on pom quantity and dom quantity were both 0 25 the effects of nutrients on phytoplankton pom quantity and dom quantity were 0 53 0 49 and 0 51 respectively the effects of trace metals on phytoplankton pom quantity and dom quantity were 0 34 0 32 and 0 30 respectively the standardized path coefficient of pom quantity on dom quantity was 0 62 indicating the transformation of pom quantity to dom quantity because there was only one reflective indicator for the latent variables of sediment and phytoplankton the corresponding indicator had a loading of 1 on the latent variable all reflective indicators except for no3 n and no2 n had loadings of 0 9 on the latent variable of nutrients tal tfe and tcu had a loading of 0 9 and the dissolved metals showed a relatively low loading for the latent variable of metals all the reflective indicator loadings on the latent variable of pom quantity were 0 78 0 99 all reflective indicators loadings for the latent variable of dom quantity were within 0 80 0 98 except for c1 0 69 c4 0 65 and doc 0 52 4 discussion 4 1 cyanobacteria blooms induce the mobilization of substances from the sediments in shallow lakes we found that not only p and n but also the biogenic elements of al fe and cu were pumped by the cyanobacteria from the sediments as evidenced by the much higher concentrations 3 5 times of the total n p al fe and cu in treatment s than those in treatment n table 1 at the end of the treatment the pls pm model results clearly demonstrated the role of the sediment in the transformation of elements including n p al fe cu and c the support of nutrients and metals from the sediments was important because the standardized coefficients of sediment on nutrients and metal 0 28 and 0 37 respectively were more than half of that of the nutrient 0 53 on phytoplankton and that is the well known strong dependence in addition to nutrients and metals the total effect of sediments played an important role in the formation of pom and dom as evidenced by the positive coefficients of 0 25 and 0 25 respectively the release of p and n from sediments in shallow lakes is enhanced during algal blooms which has been documented in field and laboratory experiments xie et al 2003 gao et al 2012 2014 giles et al 2016 alterations in ph and do have been suggested as the causes of nutrients release from sediments xie et al 2003 cao et al 2016 in this study the consumption of do via the decomposition of the substantial om resulted in the depletion of do with a concentration 0 in the enclosures fig s2 the depletion of do facilitates the release of redox sensitive iron bound phosphorus smith et al 2011 smolders et al 2017 the significant higher ph in treatment s than in treatment n could be due to the more prolific growth of cyanobacteria and the consumption of co2 hinga et al 1994 the elevation of ph promoted the desorption of phosphate due to oh competition from the iron bound phosphorus fe p and aluminum bound phosphorus al p gao et al 2012 in addition ph elevation enhanced the desorption of nh4 from sediment and suppressed denitrification and n fluxes to the atmosphere gao et al 2012 2014 in addition to the role of ph and redox alteration the effect of the algae derived dom could be another reason for the enhanced release of phosphorus dom has been demonstrated to compete with p to associate with minerals deng et al 2019 lu et al 2021 wen et al 2022 found that dom from the algae dominated zone had much stronger adsorption ability to compete phosphate onto the sediment than dom from the macrophyte dominated zone which was attributed to the more abundant polysaccharides and carboxyl containing compounds in dom from the algae dominated zone in this in situ experiment in the shallow lake the abundant algae derived dom produced in the surface water could be readily to diffuse to the sediment water interface and replace the phosphate that associated to minerals in the sediments in addition to n and p our results showed a positive interaction between cyanobacteria and the metals of fe al and cu as we have discussed the alternation of ph or depletion of do could release fe p and al p resulting in the synchronous release of fe and al synchronous release of fe and p has been observed and explained as the reductive dissolution of amorphous fe oxy hydroxides chen et al 2018 giles et al 2016 our results also showed the release of cu from the sediment which could be due to the redox sensitivity of cu as well as that of fe furthermore the complexation of algae derived dom with fe cu and al can potentially enhance the release of these metals the literature reported that the abundant metals of mn and cd released from the sediment during the algal blooms which attributed to the complexation of tyrosine like components chen et al 2021a the significantly higher concentrations of the substances nutrients and metals in the surface water than in the bottom water fig 1 a vs fig 1 b confirmed the participation of cyanobacteria in the biogeochemical cycles of these substances microcystis sp the dominant species of phytoplankton in summer in lake chaohu possesses gas vesicles which are hollow protein structures filled with gas providing buoyancy to the cells of several bloom forming cyanobacterial species so that they can float upward huisman et al 2018 pfeifer 2012 walsby 1994 in treatment n nutrient deficiency could accelerate the death of cyanobacteria which subsequently decayed to the bottom water and lysed the dissolved substances this explained that in bottom water the concentrations were higher in treatment n than those in treatment s figs 1 2 regardless of total or dissolved substances another explanation could be the association of om with minerals at the sediment water interface 4 2 biogeochemical transformation of organic carbon and the formation of potential refractory om in this study organic carbon is generated via photosynthesis during phytoplankton growth a high positive standardized path coefficient 0 93 between chl a concentration and pom quantity in pls pm confirmed their synchronous change and the dominance of chl a in the pom dom was initially produced from the lysis of pom as evidenced by the negative standardized path coefficient between the pom quantity and dom quantity 0 62 fig 6 moreover our results clearly demonstrated that the quality of dom differed to that of pom fig 5 thus the obvious difference in pom quality and dom quality suggested the transformation of algae derived dom by bacteria the presence of sediments was found to facilitate the biotransformation of algae derived dom as evidenced by the more distinct difference between pom and dom in treatment s than in treatment n figs 4 and 5 this distinct difference could be caused by the sufficient supply of biogenic elements to the bacterial metabolism from the sediments as discussed in section 4 1 the dominant components in pom of two protein like components c4 tryptophan like component and c5 tyrosine like component were readily utilized by bacteria lu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 during the consumption of protein like substances the accompanying generation of humic like components by bacterial assemblages has been shown bittar et al 2015 romera castillo et al 2011 this finding explains the higher c1 microbially derived humic like substance in dom than in pom in this study moreover the distinct difference in fluorescent characteristics between c2 dominant protein like component in dom and c4 c5 dominant component in pom further suggested the transformation of om via bacterial metabolism after the microbial transformation the molecular weight and aromaticity of the om increased evidenced by the lower values of the e2 e3 and higher values of hix in dom than in pom fig 5 the microbially derived humic like component c1 is more refractory than protein like substances of c4 and c5 lu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 in addition c1 possesses weak photoreactivity du et al 2016 which suggested that such compounds cannot be readily further transformed therefore such microbially derived components could be sequestrated in the sediments by associating with minerals through adsorption or coprecipitation reactions or accumulated in the water column as refractory dom rdom because the affinity of the microbially derived humic like component with minerals is relatively weak luo et al 2021 luo et al 2022 the major fraction could be retained in the water column in the marine ecosystem a tremendous pool of rdom 660 pg c has been documented hansell et al 2009 houghton 2007 however the formation mechanism of the rdom was an enigma that called for intensive scientific effort among these mechanisms the microbial carbon pump mcp that is dom released by phytoplankton is quickly processed by microheterotrops and generates rdom which seems to partly reveal the formation mechanism of rdom jiao et al 2010 however many questions remain unanswered such as what is the molecular structure baltar et al 2021 whether rdom is intrinsic recalcitrance or emergent recalcitrance mentges et al 2019 ogawa et al 2001 especially information on the formation of rdom in lacustrine ecosystems is very limited according to the concept of emergent recalcitrance the recalcitrance of a specific om depends on ecological networks encompassing the interactions of dom phytoplankton microbial communities and grazer dittmar et al 2021 lacustrine systems have diverse circumstances such as nutrient concentrations and microbial communities therefore questions such as whether microbially derived om can persist in the lake and what are the contributions of rdom to lacustrine carbon pool remain unknown and should be further explored the accumulation of rdom driven by the eutrophication has been confirmed in coastal environment asmala et al 2018 if the formation of rdom by mcp is also ubiquitous in lake ecosystems the amount of rdom should be substantial due to the massive algae derived om in eutrophic lakes 4 3 environmental implication our findings depicted the biogeochemical release of biogenic elements in shallow lakes from sediments to the water column which was triggered by algae growth moreover we found that the coupling between the generation of om by algae and the further processing of algae derived om by bacteria resulted in the formation of specific compounds with high molecular weights and high aromatic contents these compounds are potentially rdom and might have accumulated in the water column the presence of sediments enhanced the formation of pom and the transformation of algae derived dom to microbially derived dom we propose a conceptual framework describing the biogeochemical transformation of om by algal growth and bacterial metabolism which is a potential pathway for generating rdom in lacustrine ecosystems fig 7 although a possibility is that a fraction of the refractory dom was produced and accumulated in the lakes as a carbon sink during the algal bloom attention should be paid to the formation of ch4 via the bacterial metabolism of algae derived om under anoxic conditions praetzel et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 the positive effect of ch4 formation on climate warming would counteract the negative effect of the carbon sink via forming refractory dom thus it is necessary in further research to quantify the formation amount of these two carbon species during algal growth and to find out the conditions that facilitate the formation of refractory om but suppress ch4 under that scenario the coupling of the biological algae pump and mcp would have positive role on carbon sink in lakes 5 conclusion the in situ experiments focused the generation and transformation of om during the algal bloom in the treatments with and without sediment the sediment was found to supply nutrients and metals to phytoplankton growth at the end of the experiments the amounts of chl a tn tp tfe tcu tal and pom in the presence of sediments were approximately 3 5 times of those in the absence of sediment the results of pls pm model showed the total effects of sediment on the concentrations of nutrients trace metals phytoplankton pom quantity and dom quantity were 0 28 0 37 0 28 0 25 and 0 25 respectively the negative standard path coefficient 0 62 between pom quantity and dom quantity evidenced the formation of dom from pom the pom quality corresponding to that of the algae derived om was characterized as low molecular weight and high relative abundance of protein like components while dom had higher molecular weight and higher humification than pom the difference in quality between pom and dom suggested the transformation of algae derived om to more humic compounds and the difference in quality between pom and dom was more distinct in treatment s than those treatment n overall this study found that with the participation of sediment more algae derived organic matter was formed by algal pump and they were more readily transformed to potential refractory dom by microbial carbon pump the formation of refractory dom could be a substantial carbon sink under the effective coupling between

15919,the generation of organic matter om occurs synchronously with phytoplankton growth characterization of the generated particulate and dissolved om during algal blooms in eutrophic lakes is crucial for better understanding the carbon cycle but remains limited we speculate that sediments play a critical role in the biogeochemical transformation of om derived from algal blooms in shallow lakes in this study changes in om quantity and quality and the concentrations of biogenic elements nutrients and metals during algal blooms were studied in situ in a shallow eutrophic lake lake chaohu china two enclosure treatments in the presence and absence of sediments were compared and the cause effect relationships among sediment nutrients metals phytoplankton particulate om pom and dissolved om dom were revealed by a partial least square path model pls pm the results showed that the changes in nutrients and metals concentrations over time were consistent with that of chlorophyll a chl a and at the end of the treatment the concentrations of chl a nutrients and metals in treatment s with sediments were approximately 3 5 times of those in treatment n without sediments the high concentration of chl a in treatment s resulted in a high quantity of pom which showed low molecular weight low humification and was enriched in protein like components 70 for dom the quantity increased after the decrease in pom and dom quality showed a significantly higher abundance of humic like components and a higher molecular weight than pom did the pls pm results showed that the significant positive effects of sediment on nutrients metals phytoplankton pom and dom were 0 28 0 37 0 28 0 25 and 0 25 respectively suggesting that sediment had an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of these substances the significant negative relationship between pom and dom 0 62 and the distinct difference in pom and dom quality implied the efficient transformation of the freshly generated om to those with a higher molecular weight higher humification and potentially refractory our results depicted the quick biogeochemical transformation of nutrients metals and the potential formation of refractory organic carbon in water column as driven by the couple of the algae pump with the microbial carbon pump graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biogeochemical transformation algal bloom sediment organic matter humic like substance refractory dissolved organic matter 1 introduction under the scenarios of climate change and intensive anthropogenic activity eutrophication and the subsequent occurrence of algal blooms in aquatic ecosystems have become a global environmental problem beaulieu et al 2013 o neil et al 2012 paerl and paul 2012 outbreaks of algal blooms have negative effects on the biodiversity and functioning of aquatic food webs and threaten the use of affected water for drinking water bathing fishing and other recreational uses huisman et al 2018 several strategies i e the reduction of nutrient loading hydrodynamic changes and chemical or biological control have been developed to prevent and suppress algal blooms copetti et al 2016 jeppesen et al 2005 parel and otten 2013 among these control strategies the reduction of nutrient loading is essential to solve the problem however the release of phosphorus p from sediments in shallow lakes often sustains eutrophication long after the reduction of external loading from the watershed retarding the restoration of eutrophic lakes scheffer and jeppesen 2007 differed to the stratification of deep lake shallow lakes are usually well mixed and has the homogenous temperature and dissolved oxygen do throughout the water column thus the frequent exchange of the substances could happen between the sediment and the water column søndergaard et al 2003 in shallow lakes the positive feedback between algal blooms and the release of p from sediments had been found algal blooms have been suggested to perform like a pump and induce a massive release of p from the sediments due to the increase in ph and the decrease in the redox potential of the lake water cao et al 2016 xie et al 2003 not only p the release of the other biogenic elements such as iron fe and nitrogen n from the sediment was enhanced during the algal bloom chen et al 2018 reported the accompanying release of fe with p due to their close association and the increasing release flux of nitrogen n was driven due to the constrain of nitrification denitrification couple by the elevated ph during algal blooms gao et al 2012 thus we expect that in shallow eutrophic water algal blooms could induce a strong role on the biogeochemical cycle of these elements including p n and other metal elements the fixation of inorganic carbon to organic carbon in the form of om via photosynthesis during phytoplankton growth and the subsequent transformation of om are other important aspects of the elements biogeochemical cycles during algal blooms the major constituents of phytoplankton cells are proteins carbohydrates and lipids myklestad 2000 extracellular exudation or cell lysis releases algae derived dom which is highly bioavailable and can be transformed by bacterial metabolism bittar et al 2015 teeling et al 2012 lab scale studies have shown the consumption of algae derived dom and the reproduction of dom with a distinct composition by bacteria bittar et al 2015 romera castillo et al 2011 during the microbial transfromation it was found that the tryptophan like component in algae derived dom was effectively consumed while the microbially derived humic like component accumulated bai et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 however information from in situ experiments on the carbon biogeochemical cycle during algal blooms is limited in this study we performed in situ enclosure experiments in a shallow eutrophic lake lake chaohu china focusing on i the production and transformation of the organic matter pom and dom during the algal bloom and ii the roles of sediments in providing essential elements to support the growth of phytoplankton and in om transformation we hypothesized that i as an active bio pump an algal bloom mobilizes massive amounts of biogenic elements not only n p but also metals e g fe and cu from sediment and ii algal growth will be accelerated in the presence of sediment resulting in the formation of a large amount of algae derived om which would be subsequently transformed by bacteria in this study the composition of initial algae derived om was referred by that of the collected pom because of the substantial phytoplankton biomass in the enclosures and based on results from the previous incubation experiments on the transformation of algae derived om which were discussed above the composition of dom in lake water consisted of both algae derived dom and those produced from the subsequent processing of the algae derived om therefore the difference in the composition of pom and dom in lake water could be due to the microbial transformation we used a partial least square path model pls pm to reveal the relationships among the variables of sediment nutrients metals phytoplankton pom and dom the results is helpful to elucidate the biogeochemical cycle of carbon during the algal bloom in shallow lakes 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection a 13 day in situ enclosure experiment was conducted in august 2015 in lake chaohu 31 25 31 43 n 117 5 117 16 e which is the fifth largest freshwater lake in china with a surface area of 760 km2 and a mean depth of 2 69 m rapid industrialization and urbanization since the 1980s have led to the eutrophication of lake chaohu zhang and kong 2015 cyanobacterial blooms occurred throughout the lake from may to november each year and cyanobacteria mainly microcystis spp reached 88 99 of the total phytoplankton biomass zhang et al 2015 on august 5th 2015 four enclosures length width height of 5 0 m 5 0 m 3 5 m were set up near the shore of lake chaohu the four enclosures were made of polyethylene two enclosures t1 and t2 were bottom free and contained the sediments treatment with sediments treatment s the other two t3 and t4 had the bottom side and the sediments were excluded treatment with no sediments treatment n to explore the effect of the original biomass of cyanobacteria on the biogeochemical transformation of elements 150 l of fresh cyanobacteria concentrates collected from the lake water outside of the enclosures were added to two enclosures t2 and t4 while no cyanobacteria concentrates were added in the other two enclosures t1 and t3 the initial chl a concentrations t 0 d in the surface water of the enclosures with and without the addition of fresh cyanobacteria were 22 336 µg l mean value in t2 and t4 and 15 822 mean value in t1 and t3 respectively when t 3 d the chl a concentrations in t1 and t3 were similar to those in t2 and t4 respectively due to in situ growth of cyanobacteria thus the difference in the original chl a concentrations between t1 t2 and t3 t4 was regarded to have negligible effects in our experiments

reduce the matrix data into discrete components with different source compositional characteristics stedmon and bro 2008 the model with 112 eems 56 eems of dom and 56 eems of pom extract generated the fluorescence intensity fmax unit r u of five components for each sample the five eem parafac components identified by the model were submitted to the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 for source assignment the total fluorescence intensity ftotal was calculated as the sum of the fluorescence intensities of five parafac components in addition a series of optical indices e2 e3 fluorescence index fi humification index hix and autotrophic productivity bix were calculated to evaluate the quality of dom and pom extract and their calculation and interpretation are provided in table s1 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed in r 3 6 3 r core team 2020 and plotted using the r package ggplot2 differences in quality indices between dom and pom between were examined by using the non parametric kruskal wallis with dunn post hoc test dunn test package the influence of sediment time and their interaction fixed effects on the response variables including concentrations of chl a nutrients and metals pom quantity and dom quantity was studied using generalized linear mixed model glmm bolker et al 2009 we fitted five candidate models fix effects sediment time sediment time sediment time and null using the glmmtmb function from the glmmtmb package brooks et al 2017 enclosure identity t1 and t2 t3 and t4 was used as a random effect the model of sediment time had three independent terms of sediment time also their interaction term the model of sediment time had two independent terms of sediment and time and models of sediment and time only had one independent term of sediment and time respectively the model of null had no independent term the best model was selected based on the lowest akaike information criterion value from the default anova function principal component analysis pca was performed to visualize the statistical differences in the quality between pom and dom pca was conducted using function princomp and the variables were centered and scaled before the analysis the predictors for om quality were the optical indices of e2 e3 hix bix and fi and the relative abundance of eem parafac components c1 c5 pls pm was employed to quantify the underlying cause effect relationships among sediment nutrients metals phytoplankton pom quantity and dom quantity this method is known as the partial least squares approach to structural equation modeling and allows the estimation of complex cause effect relationship models with latent variables thus the method is particularly suitable for multivariate data such as those in this study chen et al 2021b du et al 2021 wang et al 2016 pls pm analysis was performed using the r package plspm the full path model comprises two submodels the inner model structural model and the outer model measurement model sanchez 2013 the inner model demonstrated the cause effect relationships among the six latent variables fig s1 the establishment of the inner model was based on the experimental results also the possible mechanism to describe the cause effect relationships among sediment nutrients metals phytoplankton pom quantity and dom quality the supply of nutrients and metals from the sediment which were taken up by the phytoplankton the growth of phytoplankton directly resulted in the carbon fixation and thus pom formation while the production of dom was from the bacteria metabolism of pom and the nutrients and metals could have a role on the bacteria metabolism the outer model is part of the model that describes the relationships between each latent variable and the corresponding reflective indicators the loadings of the indicators on the latent variable were calculated as their correlations which indicated the dependence of the latent variable on the indicators sanchez 2013 the reflective indicators for each latent variable are presented in supplementary table s2 3 results 3 1 changes in chl a nutrients and metals concentrations with time in treatment s and treatment n cyanobacteria possess gas vesicles which enable living cyanobacteria to float upward huisman et al 2018 therefore the concentrations of chl a nutrients and metals in the surface and bottom waters were investigated separately 3 1 1 chl a concentrations in surface water the model selection by using a glmm showed a significant interaction effect of sediment and time on chl a concentrations fig 1 a table s3 the concentrations of chl a were higher in treatment s than in treatment n fig 1 a the positive values of the coefficients i e 5472 table s3 of the interactive effect suggested that the difference in chl a concentrations between treatment s and treatment n increased with reaction time model selection by using glmm for chl a concentrations in the bottom water also showed a significant interaction effect between sediment and time fig 1 b table s3 contrary to those in the surface water the concentrations of chl a were lower in treatment s than in treatment n the negative values of the coefficients i e 25 9 table s3 suggested that a negative difference chl a concentrations in the treatment s minus those in treatment n increased with time notably the order of magnitude 3 5 for chl a concentrations in the surface water is much higher than that 1 2 in the bottom water 3 1 2 nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the surface water model selection showed a significant positive interaction effect of sediment and time on the concentrations of tn tp dtn nh4 n and po4 3 p fig 1 a table s3 which was the same as that for chl a concentrations in the surface water for other species of nutrients model selection by glmm showed a significant positive effect of sediment on dtp concentrations and no significant differences in no3 and no2 concentrations between treatment s and treatment n were found table s3 in the bottom water model selection by glmm showed a marginally significant interactive effect of sediment and time on tp and dtp concentrations p 0 076 fig 1 b table s3 tp and dtp concentrations were lower in treatment s than in treatment n and the negative values treatment s minus treatment n enlarged with time fig 1 b the effects of sediment and time on nitrogen concentrations were different among the different species of nitrogen model selection showed a significant effect of sediment treatment on tn concentrations and a significant effect of time on dtn no3 and nh4 concentrations table s3 3 1 3 metals concentrations in surface water model selection by glmm showed a significant interaction effect of sediment and time on tfe tal and tcu concentrations fig 1 a table s3 the concentrations of tfe tal and tcu in treatment s were higher than those treatment n and the difference between the two treatments enlarged with the time model selection showed that the presence of sediments had a positive significant effect on the total dissolved fe tdfe concentrations but had no effect on the total concentrations of dissolved al and cu tdal and tdcu for ferrous ions concentrations no significant effect of the presence of sediment or time was observed fig 1 a table s3 in the bottom water model selection by glmm showed a significant interaction effect of sediment and time on the concentrations of tfe tal tcu and ferrous ion fig 1 b table s3 in contrast with the situation in surface water the concentrations of tfe tal and tcu in treatment s were lower than those in treatment n which was obvious beyond t 8 d for the concentrations of the total dissolved metals model selection by glmm showed a significant effect of sediments on tdfe but not on tdal and tdcu fig 1 b table s3 the discrepancy in chl a nutrients and metals concentrations between treatment s and treatment n showed contrary phenomenon in the surface water and bottom water in surface water the matter concentrations were higher in treatment s than those in treatment n and vice versa in the bottom water to measure the discrepancy in the concentrations of chl a nutrients and metals between treatment s and treatment n the concentrations of matter in the enclosures at t 13 d were calculated as the mean values of the concentrations in the surface water and bottom water cmean the effect of the sediments on the matter concentrations was quantified as the ratio of cmean sed to cmean nosed cmean sed cmean nosed table 1 the concentrations of chl a tn tp tal tfe tcu dtn and dtp in treatment s were approximately 3 5 times of those in treatment n the ratios of cmean sed cmean nosed for tdal and tdfe were low as 1 2 1 6 and those for tdcu and ferrous ion were 0 8 and 0 3 respectively table 1 3 2 changes in pom and dom composition with time in treatment s and treatment n five eem parafac components were identified fig 2 and table 2 component 1 c1 an excitation maximum at 295 nm and an emission maximum at 378 nm represents a microbially derived humic like substance gueguen et al 2015 component 3 c3 excitation emission maximum 260 360 442 nm is assigned as a humic like substance which is regarded as mainly from terrestrial sources sharma et al 2017 component 2 c2 excitation emission maximum 275 332 nm is a protein like component and component 4 c4 excitation emission 280 352 nm and component 5 c5 excitation emission maximum 275 304 nm are tryptophan like and tyrosine like components respectively 3 2 1 pom quantity and quality chromophoric om a254 pom a280 pom and a350 pom and fluorescent om parafac components of c1 pom c5 pom in the pom extract were used to determine the pom quantity in general the changes in pom quantity with time fig 3 and table s4 were consistent with those of chl a in the corresponding treatment because the formation of pom was driven by the growth of cyanobacteria there were significant positive interaction effects of sediment and time on the pom quantity in the surface water but negative significant interaction effects in the bottom water that is in the surface water the pom quantity was higher in treatment s than those in treatment n but in the bottom water pom quantity was lower in treatment s than those in treatment n in addition the difference in pom quantity between the two treatments increased with time at the end of the experiment the concentrations of the different components of pom in treatment s were approximately 3 6 times those in treatment n except for c1 pom 1 5 times table 1 for all pom the relative abundance of the five parafac components was c5 pom 47 1 24 c4 pom 24 1 8 8 c2 pom 12 4 14 6 c3 pom 8 6 5 6 c1 pom 7 8 5 2 the most abundant parafac component was c5 pom tyrosine like substance followed by c4 pom tryptophan like substance the value for the e2 e3 of pom was 22 4 17 7 hix was 0 68 0 57 bix was 0 85 0 32 and fi was 2 61 0 54 indicating that pom was dominated by the low molecular weight and low aromatic content compound 3 2 2 dom quantity and quality the effects of sediment and time on dom quantity are shown in fig 3 and table s4 that is in the surface water dom quantity was higher in treatment s than those in treatment n on the contrary in the bottom water dom quantity was lower in treatment s than those in treatment n both in the surface water and in the bottom water the difference in dom quantity between treatment s and treatment n increased over time for all dom the relative abundance was c2 dom 53 10 3 c1 dom 20 2 13 8 c5 dom 11 6 6 8 c3 dom 11 4 3 5 c4 dom 3 8 4 2 the value for the e2 e3 was 4 41 2 58 hix was 0 88 0 39 bix was 1 03 0 41 and fi was 2 38 0 31 for dom 3 2 3 comparison in quality between pom and dom the time series of dom in the surface water showed that in treatment s dom remained unchanged at the beginning of 7 d and then increased after 10 d dom decreased fig 3 the change in dom quantity with time in treatment s was opposite to that in pom i e pom decreased during days 7 10 and then increased this meant that the lysis or secretion of cyanobacterial cell released dom which underwent subsequent transformation in treatment s dom showed a significantly higher c1 c2 and c3 but lower c4 and c5 than pom as well as a higher hix value but lower e2 e3 and fi values fig 4 in treatment n dom also showed a significantly higher c1 c2 and e2 e3 but a lower c4 and c5 than pom did but no significant differences were found in c3 hix or fi values between dom and pom in treatment n pca analysis fig 5 based on the om quality the optical indices e2 e3 fi hix and bix and the relative abundance of parafac component c1 c5 showed that the situation of pom and dom samples was almost opposite pc1 and pc2 explained 40 8 and 25 8 of the variation in om quality respectively c1 c3 and hix were situated at the positive direction of pc1 and c4 c5 and e2 e3 were situated at the negative direction of pc1 all dom samples were situated in the positive pc1 direction whereas the major pom samples were situated in the negative pc1 direction the presence of sediment had minor influence on om quality the circle for pom samples in treatment s situated at a more negative position of pc1 than that in treatment n 3 3 pls pm this study showed that in general 1 similar changes with time in concentrations of nutrients and metals pom quantity to that of chl a and the concentrations of chl a nutrients metals pom and dom quantity were substantially influenced by the presence of sediments 2 the opposite change tendency with time was found between dom quantity and pom quantity the results of the pls pm model fig 6 table 3 showed the relationships among sediment nutrients metals phytoplankton pom quantity and dom quantity the total effects of the sediment on nutrients metals and phytoplankton were 0 28 0 37 and 0 28 respectively the total effects of sediments on pom quantity and dom quantity were both 0 25 the effects of nutrients on phytoplankton pom quantity and dom quantity were 0 53 0 49 and 0 51 respectively the effects of trace metals on phytoplankton pom quantity and dom quantity were 0 34 0 32 and 0 30 respectively the standardized path coefficient of pom quantity on dom quantity was 0 62 indicating the transformation of pom quantity to dom quantity because there was only one reflective indicator for the latent variables of sediment and phytoplankton the corresponding indicator had a loading of 1 on the latent variable all reflective indicators except for no3 n and no2 n had loadings of 0 9 on the latent variable of nutrients tal tfe and tcu had a loading of 0 9 and the dissolved metals showed a relatively low loading for the latent variable of metals all the reflective indicator loadings on the latent variable of pom quantity were 0 78 0 99 all reflective indicators loadings for the latent variable of dom quantity were within 0 80 0 98 except for c1 0 69 c4 0 65 and doc 0 52 4 discussion 4 1 cyanobacteria blooms induce the mobilization of substances from the sediments in shallow lakes we found that not only p and n but also the biogenic elements of al fe and cu were pumped by the cyanobacteria from the sediments as evidenced by the much higher concentrations 3 5 times of the total n p al fe and cu in treatment s than those in treatment n table 1 at the end of the treatment the pls pm model results clearly demonstrated the role of the sediment in the transformation of elements including n p al fe cu and c the support of nutrients and metals from the sediments was important because the standardized coefficients of sediment on nutrients and metal 0 28 and 0 37 respectively were more than half of that of the nutrient 0 53 on phytoplankton and that is the well known strong dependence in addition to nutrients and metals the total effect of sediments played an important role in the formation of pom and dom as evidenced by the positive coefficients of 0 25 and 0 25 respectively the release of p and n from sediments in shallow lakes is enhanced during algal blooms which has been documented in field and laboratory experiments xie et al 2003 gao et al 2012 2014 giles et al 2016 alterations in ph and do have been suggested as the causes of nutrients release from sediments xie et al 2003 cao et al 2016 in this study the consumption of do via the decomposition of the substantial om resulted in the depletion of do with a concentration 0 in the enclosures fig s2 the depletion of do facilitates the release of redox sensitive iron bound phosphorus smith et al 2011 smolders et al 2017 the significant higher ph in treatment s than in treatment n could be due to the more prolific growth of cyanobacteria and the consumption of co2 hinga et al 1994 the elevation of ph promoted the desorption of phosphate due to oh competition from the iron bound phosphorus fe p and aluminum bound phosphorus al p gao et al 2012 in addition ph elevation enhanced the desorption of nh4 from sediment and suppressed denitrification and n fluxes to the atmosphere gao et al 2012 2014 in addition to the role of ph and redox alteration the effect of the algae derived dom could be another reason for the enhanced release of phosphorus dom has been demonstrated to compete with p to associate with minerals deng et al 2019 lu et al 2021 wen et al 2022 found that dom from the algae dominated zone had much stronger adsorption ability to compete phosphate onto the sediment than dom from the macrophyte dominated zone which was attributed to the more abundant polysaccharides and carboxyl containing compounds in dom from the algae dominated zone in this in situ experiment in the shallow lake the abundant algae derived dom produced in the surface water could be readily to diffuse to the sediment water interface and replace the phosphate that associated to minerals in the sediments in addition to n and p our results showed a positive interaction between cyanobacteria and the metals of fe al and cu as we have discussed the alternation of ph or depletion of do could release fe p and al p resulting in the synchronous release of fe and al synchronous release of fe and p has been observed and explained as the reductive dissolution of amorphous fe oxy hydroxides chen et al 2018 giles et al 2016 our results also showed the release of cu from the sediment which could be due to the redox sensitivity of cu as well as that of fe furthermore the complexation of algae derived dom with fe cu and al can potentially enhance the release of these metals the literature reported that the abundant metals of mn and cd released from the sediment during the algal blooms which attributed to the complexation of tyrosine like components chen et al 2021a the significantly higher concentrations of the substances nutrients and metals in the surface water than in the bottom water fig 1 a vs fig 1 b confirmed the participation of cyanobacteria in the biogeochemical cycles of these substances microcystis sp the dominant species of phytoplankton in summer in lake chaohu possesses gas vesicles which are hollow protein structures filled with gas providing buoyancy to the cells of several bloom forming cyanobacterial species so that they can float upward huisman et al 2018 pfeifer 2012 walsby 1994 in treatment n nutrient deficiency could accelerate the death of cyanobacteria which subsequently decayed to the bottom water and lysed the dissolved substances this explained that in bottom water the concentrations were higher in treatment n than those in treatment s figs 1 2 regardless of total or dissolved substances another explanation could be the association of om with minerals at the sediment water interface 4 2 biogeochemical transformation of organic carbon and the formation of potential refractory om in this study organic carbon is generated via photosynthesis during phytoplankton growth a high positive standardized path coefficient 0 93 between chl a concentration and pom quantity in pls pm confirmed their synchronous change and the dominance of chl a in the pom dom was initially produced from the lysis of pom as evidenced by the negative standardized path coefficient between the pom quantity and dom quantity 0 62 fig 6 moreover our results clearly demonstrated that the quality of dom differed to that of pom fig 5 thus the obvious difference in pom quality and dom quality suggested the transformation of algae derived dom by bacteria the presence of sediments was found to facilitate the biotransformation of algae derived dom as evidenced by the more distinct difference between pom and dom in treatment s than in treatment n figs 4 and 5 this distinct difference could be caused by the sufficient supply of biogenic elements to the bacterial metabolism from the sediments as discussed in section 4 1 the dominant components in pom of two protein like components c4 tryptophan like component and c5 tyrosine like component were readily utilized by bacteria lu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 during the consumption of protein like substances the accompanying generation of humic like components by bacterial assemblages has been shown bittar et al 2015 romera castillo et al 2011 this finding explains the higher c1 microbially derived humic like substance in dom than in pom in this study moreover the distinct difference in fluorescent characteristics between c2 dominant protein like component in dom and c4 c5 dominant component in pom further suggested the transformation of om via bacterial metabolism after the microbial transformation the molecular weight and aromaticity of the om increased evidenced by the lower values of the e2 e3 and higher values of hix in dom than in pom fig 5 the microbially derived humic like component c1 is more refractory than protein like substances of c4 and c5 lu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 in addition c1 possesses weak photoreactivity du et al 2016 which suggested that such compounds cannot be readily further transformed therefore such microbially derived components could be sequestrated in the sediments by associating with minerals through adsorption or coprecipitation reactions or accumulated in the water column as refractory dom rdom because the affinity of the microbially derived humic like component with minerals is relatively weak luo et al 2021 luo et al 2022 the major fraction could be retained in the water column in the marine ecosystem a tremendous pool of rdom 660 pg c has been documented hansell et al 2009 houghton 2007 however the formation mechanism of the rdom was an enigma that called for intensive scientific effort among these mechanisms the microbial carbon pump mcp that is dom released by phytoplankton is quickly processed by microheterotrops and generates rdom which seems to partly reveal the formation mechanism of rdom jiao et al 2010 however many questions remain unanswered such as what is the molecular structure baltar et al 2021 whether rdom is intrinsic recalcitrance or emergent recalcitrance mentges et al 2019 ogawa et al 2001 especially information on the formation of rdom in lacustrine ecosystems is very limited according to the concept of emergent recalcitrance the recalcitrance of a specific om depends on ecological networks encompassing the interactions of dom phytoplankton microbial communities and grazer dittmar et al 2021 lacustrine systems have diverse circumstances such as nutrient concentrations and microbial communities therefore questions such as whether microbially derived om can persist in the lake and what are the contributions of rdom to lacustrine carbon pool remain unknown and should be further explored the accumulation of rdom driven by the eutrophication has been confirmed in coastal environment asmala et al 2018 if the formation of rdom by mcp is also ubiquitous in lake ecosystems the amount of rdom should be substantial due to the massive algae derived om in eutrophic lakes 4 3 environmental implication our findings depicted the biogeochemical release of biogenic elements in shallow lakes from sediments to the water column which was triggered by algae growth moreover we found that the coupling between the generation of om by algae and the further processing of algae derived om by bacteria resulted in the formation of specific compounds with high molecular weights and high aromatic contents these compounds are potentially rdom and might have accumulated in the water column the presence of sediments enhanced the formation of pom and the transformation of algae derived dom to microbially derived dom we propose a conceptual framework describing the biogeochemical transformation of om by algal growth and bacterial metabolism which is a potential pathway for generating rdom in lacustrine ecosystems fig 7 although a possibility is that a fraction of the refractory dom was produced and accumulated in the lakes as a carbon sink during the algal bloom attention should be paid to the formation of ch4 via the bacterial metabolism of algae derived om under anoxic conditions praetzel et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 the positive effect of ch4 formation on climate warming would counteract the negative effect of the carbon sink via forming refractory dom thus it is necessary in further research to quantify the formation amount of these two carbon species during algal growth and to find out the conditions that facilitate the formation of refractory om but suppress ch4 under that scenario the coupling of the biological algae pump and mcp would have positive role on carbon sink in lakes 5 conclusion the in situ experiments focused the generation and transformation of om during the algal bloom in the treatments with and without sediment the sediment was found to supply nutrients and metals to phytoplankton growth at the end of the experiments the amounts of chl a tn tp tfe tcu tal and pom in the presence of sediments were approximately 3 5 times of those in the absence of sediment the results of pls pm model showed the total effects of sediment on the concentrations of nutrients trace metals phytoplankton pom quantity and dom quantity were 0 28 0 37 0 28 0 25 and 0 25 respectively the negative standard path coefficient 0 62 between pom quantity and dom quantity evidenced the formation of dom from pom the pom quality corresponding to that of the algae derived om was characterized as low molecular weight and high relative abundance of protein like components while dom had higher molecular weight and higher humification than pom the difference in quality between pom and dom suggested the transformation of algae derived om to more humic compounds and the difference in quality between pom and dom was more distinct in treatment s than those treatment n overall this study found that with the participation of sediment more algae derived organic matter was formed by algal pump and they were more readily transformed to potential refractory dom by microbial carbon pump the formation of refractory dom could be a substantial carbon sink under the effective coupling between
