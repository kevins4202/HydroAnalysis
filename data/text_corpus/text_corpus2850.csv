author graphical abstract simultaneous removal of lead ii and nitrate from water were investigated by using aluminum and iron electrodes at low voltage the results showed that the pollutant removal not only increases with increasing voltage and decreasing electrode distance but also is inhibited by solution acidity the overall removal is considered to include three synchronous processes i e chemical reduction cr electrochemical reduction ecr and electrocoagulation ec at ph of 4 10 with electrode distant of 2 cm under 6 v the ecr played great role on nitrate removal whereas both cr and ec hardly worked however it can be found that in solution at ph 4 6 cr and ecr are main processes in lead ii removal with no ec happening at ph of 6 10 cr and ecr contributed more than ec therefore we conclude that efficient lead ii removal is mainly achieved cr and ecr rather than ec at ph of 4 10 whereas nitrate removal is by ecr the optimal removals of lead ii 99 7 and nitrate 57 6 were achieved at ph 6 with low applied voltage of 6 v and electrode distance of 2 cm finally it was confirmed by the experiment using kno3 instead of pb no3 2 that the presence of lead ii ions can significantly inhibit nitrate removal keywords simultaneous removal lead ii nitrate chemical reduction electrochemical reduction electrocoagulation 1 introduction lead ii and nitrate pollution in water environment has drawn intensive attention due to their toxicity to human body and the ecosystem lead ii pollution is mainly caused by smelting industrial mining enterprise as well as lead acid battery plants inorganic lead compounds have been classified as group 2a by the international agency for research on cancer since 2006 which can accumulate in soft tissues and bones damaging nervous system and causing severe diseases 1 nitrate poisoning occurs through nitrite as intermediate specifically nitrate is reduced to nitrite in living organisms oxidizing the ferrous iron ii to ferric iron iii in hemoglobin rendering its ability to carry oxygen resulting in lack of oxygen in organ tissue and then causing methemoglobinemia 2 nitrate in circumstances comes mainly from agricultural fertilizers which are produced in a scale of millions of kilograms each year other sources of nitrate are industrial effluents animal manure septic tank waste and atmospheric deposition 3 at present lead nitrate as a combination of these two pollutants is widely used in gold ore refining processes in south africa russia and canada and other major gold producing countries 4 5 the use of lead nitrate to obtain the gold from the ore constitutes a potential risk for the ecosystem the local population s health and livestock production therefore the world health organization set the nitrate and lead limits in drinking water to 10 mg n l and 0 01 mg l 6 there have already been a lot of methods such as adsorption 7 8 precipitation 9 10 ion exchange 11 13 electrochemical reduction ecr 14 16 and reverse osmosis which have been developed to remove lead ii to reduce its pollution of them precipitation has been the most popularly used in plants for a primary lead ii removal for example the wastewater from lead acid battery plant is treated by a neutralization flocculation process and the settled sludge needs further disposal for toxic heavy metal however this method is not sufficient for removing low concentration of lead ii to meet the request of water reservation and plant recycling among methods listed above ecr and electrocoagulation ec have been identified to be the promising process because of their high removal efficiency and few sludge generations in electrochemical treatment iron and aluminum electrodes have been extensively used because they are more efficient and inexpensive as compared to other electrode materials orescanin et al 15 have ever utilized a set of iron and aluminum electrodes to treat electroplating wastewater and 96 8 of lead ii was removed khosa et al 17 employed some sacrificial anodes to treat lead ii containing wastewater during which al or fe cations were released into the solution and formed active coagulant flocs 99 3 and 91 4 of lead ii ions could be flocculated and then removed aluminum and iron can be oxidized rapidly under anode current forming floccules to catch lead ii ions in water without filtration or additional chemicals 18 19 in the process ec mainly occurred around the anode ecr and chemical reduction cr happened around on the cathode simultaneously physical chemical and biological treatments were also found to be feasible for nitrate removal 20 22 koparal et al 23 previously described an impressive study that the ecr and ec removed nitrate to allowable concentration at solution ph of 5 7 and 9 11 respectively indicating that both of them play the largest role on nitrate removal at different ph but cannot work well simultaneously actual wastewaters usually contain quite a lot of chemical substances which are always more or less hazardous to human health and ecological environment to make an efficient removal of pollutants a few studies also have been reported recently for example chen et al 24 synthesized a bifunctional mesoporous silica adsorbent which showed a considerable adsorption capacity in lead ii and nitrate removal although nitrate removal was still not very desirable however to the best of our knowledge the safe simple fast cost efficient and environmental friendly technology is still very little in our study to find such a desirable method for large scale application in wastewater treatment the simultaneous removal of lead ii and nitrate ions was experimentally investigated by combination of ec ecr and cr technologies with aluminum and iron used as the electrodes in order to avoid severe side reactions in aqueous environment under high operating voltage we applied a voltage at 2 8 v which was lower than the normal operating voltages popularly applied in other works 14 17 21 25 2 lead ii and nitrate removal mechanism in this study three removal routines involved in lead ii and nitrate containing wastewater treatment by using aluminum and iron electrodes were considered to be ecr cr and ec 2 1 electrocoagulation ec the most widely used anode materials in ec process are aluminum and iron because of their chemical and economic properties when aluminum anode is applied the following main reactions may happen 1 anode al al3 3e 2 cathode3h2o 3e 1 5 h2 3oh 3 overall reactional 3h2o al oh 3 1 5h2 the aluminum ions al3 generated in reaction 1 may be

as follows 27 28 4 anodefe fe2 2e 5 fe2 2oh fe oh 2 6 cathode2h2o 2e h2 2oh 7 overall reactionfe 2h2o fe oh 2 h2 after contacting with dissolved oxygen in water fe2 may be oxidized to fe3 fe2 and fe3 ions can be hydrolyzed to fe oh 2 fe oh 3 fe h2o 6 3 fe h2o 5 oh fe h2o 4 oh 2 and fe2 h2o 8 oh 2 4 in water the production of all these hydrolysates is strongly dependent on the solution ph the hydrolysates usually have large surface area and are favorable for adsorption and trap of soluble compounds and colloidal particles at the same time hydrogen bubbles arising from cathode surface can capture and float suspended solids resulting in additional removal of pollutants furthermore oh produced in the cathode zone is also beneficial to pb ii precipitation finally lead ii was removed from aqueous medium by precipitation 29 30 2 2 electrochemical reduction ecr ecr of heavy metal ions and nitrate has attracted more and more attention since it is convenient environmental friendly and cost effective ecr of pollutants includes three steps adhering to the surface of cathode and then adopting electron directly or indirectly from cathode to form products and finally detaching with the generated products nitrate may be reduced to nitrogen gas or ammonium directly or nitrite as an intermediate to form nitrogen gas or ammonium eventually 31 possible reactions of nitrate on the cathode are listed as below 8 no3 3h2o 5e 0 5n2 6oh 9 no3 6h2o 8e nh3 9oh 10 no3 h2o 2e no2 2oh 11 no2 2h2o 3e 0 5n2 4oh 12 no2 5h2o 6e nh3 7oh nitrogen gas is believed to be an ideal product for nitrate removal however according to the documented reports the selective generation of n2 usually needs specific catalyst such as pd pt etc ammonium is the most common product in ecr of nitrate by al or fe electrodes 32 regarding the removal of heavy metal ions by ecr reactions normally undergo as shown by reaction 13 and then the reduced zero valent metals are deposited on the electrode 13 cathode mn

decades 3 33 34 the products of nitrate removal by metallic fe are basically ammonium and scarcely n2 and nitrite occurs as intermediate and disappears with prolonged process as shown in the following

difference lies on the proportion of nitrogen gas in the products according to the studies reported by murphy 33 and luk et al 36 the presence of nitrogen gas in products could be up to 95 under alkaline reaction conditions the chemical reactions for nitrate removal by al are as follows 19 5al 3no3 18h 5al3 1 5n2 9h2o 20 8al 3no3 30h 8al3 3nh4 9h2o 21 2al 3no3 6h 2al3 3no2 3h2o 22 2al 2no2 8h

aluminum and iron electrodes with dimensions of 2 cm 4 cm were cut from high pure metal sheets qinghe xingye metal materials co ltd china high pure copper foil 2 cm 4 cm and tgp h 060 carbon paper 2 cm 4 cm purchased from shanghai titan scientific co ltd china and toray industries co ltd japan respectively have also been used in batch experiment the solutions containing 13 mg l 6 3 10 5 mol l of pb ii and 12 mg n l 8 6 10 4 mol l of nitrate were prepared by dissolving kno3 and pb no3 2 in pure water diluted hno3 aqueous solution 0 1 mol l was used for ph adjustment when necessary all the chemicals were analytical reagent grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china 3 2 batch experiments batch experiments have been carried out to investigate simultaneous removal of lead ii and nitrate at low voltage external power source direct current used for the reactions was an electrochemical workstation in model chi 760e shanghai chenhua instruments china the cathode and anode were connected to the electrochemical workstation by insulated wires and then totally immersed into the reaction solution a saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode bulk of feed solution was 200 ml which was magnetically stirred at 650 rpm continuously during the process to maintain uniformity of the solution treated water was sampled at certain time interval and then filtered with 0 22 μm filters for nitrate and metal concentration determination different electrode distances applied potentials initial solution ph electrode materials were tested all the experiments were conducted for 2 h at room temperature 3 3 analytical methods the concentrations of lead ii aluminum and iron ions in all the water samples i e pb al and fe were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes thermo icap 6300 united states of america nitrate was measured by an ion chromatography ic metrohm mic switzerland the detection limits of nitrate and lead are 0 1 mg l and 0 001 mg l the ph values of solutions were monitored by a ph meter mettler toledo fe20 switzerland the morphology and chemical composition of the precipitates and the substances on electrode surfaces were analyzed before and after the reactions by scanning electron microscope phenom pro x holland energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds 4 results and discussions 4 1 effects of operating parameters as expected fig 1 shows that lead ii and nitrate removal achieved by using al or fe anode and cu cathode significantly decreased with the electrode distance being increased from 1 cm to 4 cm that is the current is decreased with the resistance being increased fewer lead ii and nitrates were removed to achieve significant and safe pollutant removal the electrode distance was fixed at 2 cm in later experiment in fig 1 it is also noticeable that two hour nitrate removal achieved by using aluminum and iron anodes decreased from 21 2 1 0 1 cm to 13 9 0 8 4 cm and 2 4 0 3 1 cm to 0 4 cm respectively undoubtedly such a difference of nitrate removal should be attributed to the use of aluminum and iron anodes and it has also been reported in previous studies 38 yehya et al 32 considered that the nitrate reduction was achieved through not only the ecr of nitrate on copper cathode eq 8 10 but also the cr on aluminum anode eq 19 21 in contrast the cr of nitrate on iron anode eq 15 and 16 has not been reported the effect of electrode distance on lead ii removal seems to be less than on nitrate removal this is mainly because pb were quite lower than no3 more than 90 of lead ii ions have been removed in the two hour treatment whatever anode iron or aluminum was used taking aluminum anode as an example the removal of lead ii ions decreased by about 3 2 from 98 2 1 2 to 95 0 1 6 when the electrode distance was increased from 1 cm to 4 cm by contrast it decreased by about 4 0 from 96 4 0 9 to 92 4 0 7 when using iron anode under analogous distance condition it can also be understood that lead ii ions have stronger electron capture ability of a standard electrode potential of pb2 pb0 at 298 k e p b 2 p b 0 0 0 13 v than nitrate ions no3 n2 0 96 v which will cause an easier removal via lead ii electrodeposition on copper cathode moreover lead ii ions also obtain electrons more easily from aluminum anode al3 al0 e a l 3 a l 0 0 1 66 v than from iron anode fe2 fe e f e 2 f e 0 0 0 44 v besides the electrodeposition on copper cathode eq 13 and the cr on iron and aluminum anodes eq 23 and 24 ec on aluminum anode is also a possible way of lead ii removal that is on the aluminum anode both cr as well as ec eq 24 would remove the lead ii ions lead ii and nitrate removal are two competitive processes so further investigation must be taken to clarify the roles of different routines in the simultaneous removal the effects of initial ph on simultaneous removal of lead ii and nitrate are shown in fig 2 iron cathode and aluminum anode were used it can be seen in fig 2 a that two hours treatment with an initial ph of 6 led to a nitrate removal efficiency of 20 5 0 8 while that with a ph of 4 demonstrated a little reduction to removal efficiency 19 7 1 5 when the initial ph was adjusted to 8 and 10 nitrate removal efficiencies increased to 21 7 0 2 and 22 6 1 6 respectively regarding lead ii removal fig 2 b shows that with initial ph 6 8 and 10 77 9 3 8 98 4 0 4 and 85 8 0 5 of pb ii ions were quickly removed in the first 10 min and the remaining pb ii was removed slowly the rate of lead ii removal was reduced significantly after the initiative rapid removal period first 10 min by contrast when initial ph was adjusted to 4 only 23 5 2 2 of pb ii ions were rapidly reduced in the first 30 min and after that the removal efficiency was slow down it is considered that hydrogen evolution will become easier and competitive with the ecr of lead ii and nitrate on cathode with reducing the solution ph values 17 further acidic condition is not conducive to the ec of pb ii ions near the anode due to absence of both the aluminum and iron amorphous precipitates formation and their role as pb ii absorber 17 therefore the solution ph was adjusted to 6 in later experiment actually it was observed in the experiment that with the initial ph being adjusted from 10 to 4 the removal of nitrate and pb2 was dropped from 22 6 1 6 to 19 7 1 5 and 98 9 1 3 to 32 4 0 3 respectively we have not found any flocculation at ph of 4 in our experiment therefore it is deduced that nitrate removal was not achieved via ec since the decrease was quite small when the ph was adjusted from 10 to 4 fig 2 a the sharp drop of lead ii removal with ph from 6 to 4 indicated that ec was one of the main ways for lead ii removal at ph higher than 6 fig 2 b the simultaneous removal of lead ii and nitrate also has been investigated at 2 4 6 and 8 v respectively by using cu cathode and al anode and the results are shown in fig 3 as expected the removal was increased and finally the maximum performance of both was achieved at 8 v that is the lead ii removal was improved about 3 from 94 7 2 8 97 7 1 4 while the nitrate removal although it was far lower than the lead ii removal increased about 11 times from 2 3 1 2 29 4 2 2 to obtain the reliable results of simultaneous removal of lead ii and nitrate at low power consumption condition a voltage of 6 v was applied in later experiments 4 2 analyses on different removal processes batch experiments using different electrodes e g aluminum iron and carbon paper electrolytes kno3 and pb no3 2 and voltages 0 8 v have been carried out to investigate the actual role of different processes in simultaneous removal of lead ii and nitrate all the experimental parameters and results are displayed in table 1 in which the overall removal efficiencies have been actually influenced by the synergy of multiple processes including ecr cr and ec 4 2 1 chemical and electrochemical reductions we can easily understand that ecr and ec occur only when a voltage is applied whereas cr will happen whether a voltage has been applied or not to clarify the ecr on cathode and cr on cathode and anode in lead ii and nitrate removal process carbon paper 2 cm 4 cm which has higher chemical inertness than aluminum and iron was employed as the anode and al or fe as the cathode therefore ec was completely depressed when no voltage was applied no 3 5 8 and 10 no current was observed and the occurrence of ecr was excluded theoretically cr became the only pathway for lead ii and nitrate removal experimental results in table 1 show that no nitrate removal could be observed when using aluminum no 3 and 5 or iron cathodes no 8 and 10 in pb no3 2 solution no 3 and 8 and kno3 solution no 5 and 10 whereas the lead ii removal on aluminum and iron cathodes was high up to 74 3 13 7 no 3 and 83 9 3 8 no 8 respectively there is no doubt that lead ii removal should be attributed to cr on the cathode we can deduce that whether a voltage has been applied or not lead ii ions will be more or less chemically reduced to zero valent pb on aluminum and iron electrodes cathode and even also anode moreover the experimental results in table 1 also show that when a voltage at as low as 6 v was applied the lead ii removal by using aluminum and iron cathodes with carbon paper anode went up to 94 9 0 4 no 2 and 95 9 0 8 no 7 respectively whereas nitrate removal remained quite low no 6 7 9 and 12 and even undetectable no 2 4 and 10 it is noticeable that there were two exceptions e g no 1 and no 11 in which the treatment using al anode and fe or al cathode showed to be more conducive to nitrate removal than that using fe anode at the same time lead ii removal also reached the maximum which was 99 6 0 1 for no 11 and 98 5 1 3 no 1 respectively from sem fig 4 a and eds fig 4b measurement no significant difference on morphology and chemical composition can be found on the al anode surface before and after water treatment so we conclude that pb ii can be easily removed from water by ecr and cr on the cathode sem and eds fig 4c confirmed the presence of pb on fe cathode surface the same evidence has also been observed on the al cathode but no more information is given here therefore we can understand that using al anode with fe cathode is conducive to make effective nitrate removal 4 2 2 electrocoagulation the occurrence of anodic oxidation can be observed on near al or fe anode under an applied voltage of 6 v no 1 6 11 and 12 after experiments al3 and fe3 2 ions were generated and then hydrolyzed or combined with hydroxyl to form flocculent amorphous suspensions amorphous iron and aluminum hydroxides produced at the anode are important scavengers for many metal ions due to their strong affinity for lead ii ions from large surface area porous structures and abundant binding sites 29 using aluminum and iron no 1 and 11 and no 6 and 12 respectively anode instead of carbon paper no 2 and 7 did enhance current density by more than 0 9 ma cm2 as previously mentioned in table 1 al anode exhibited higher lead ii and nitrate removal capacity than iron anode e g no 11 vs no 6 and no 1 vs no 12 ec is efficient for nitrate removal because nitrate ions can be adsorbed to a certain extent onto the surfaces of metal hydroxide precipitates 39 effluent fe ions in al fe reaction no 12 is notably high 0 69 mg l meaning that less fe hydroxides was formed during the process therefore nitrate removal efficiency is relatively lower than that in exp no 1 6 and 11 the morphology and composition on electrode surfaces before and after water treatment has been investigated by sem and eds the morphology comparison shows that aluminum and iron anode surfaces got rough after two hour water treatment no 1 6 11 and 12 for example in fe al reaction no 11 the deposition can be easily seen on used iron cathode fig 4d and table 2 as compared with the fresh one fig 4c moreover the eds analysis also confirmed the presence of lead ii on used iron cathode fig 4d and table 2 therefore we can conclude that cr ecr and ec are three main pathways for lead ii removal from water whereas ecr contributes the most to nitrate removal and cr and ec will do nothing 4 2 3 effluent metal ions and sludge generation world health organization who has ever set the maximum acceptable limits of aluminum and iron in drinking water which is 0 2 and 0 3 mg l respectively by icp oes analysis al and fe of most of effluents are below both of them with only one exception no 12 the sludge generation is another important factor in measuring the performance of a water treatment process the amount of generated sludge is related not only to the quality of influent but also to the applied voltage and electrode material in this study floccules had been observed in the reactions no 1 no 6 no 11 and no 12 and finally all were collected as sludge as shown in table 1 the fe fe reaction no 6 produced a maximum amount 205 9 15 1 kg m3 of sludge and the followings were al fe no 12 122 1 6 5 fe al no 11 72 0 2 8 and al al no 1 34 4 1 3 the use of al anodes generated less sludge than that of fe this is partly because iron has a higher molar mass 55 85 g than aluminum 26 98 g and the amounts of generated sludge should be relatively larger under the same current condition however no obvious correlation between sludge generation and others such as cathode material current density and removal efficiency can be confirmed in this study 5 conclusions based on the research findings obtained in this study the following conclusions can be drawn effective simultaneous removal of aqueous lead ii and nitrate by iron and aluminum can be made if the conditions e g electrode distance solution ph voltage and even electrode materials are controlled the optimal lead ii removal of 99 7 and nitrate removal of 57 6 can be achieved at ph 6 with low applied voltage of 6 v and electrode distance of 2 cm by using aluminum anode and iron cathode lead ii removal can be realized by chemical reduction electrochemical reduction and electrocoagulation whereas the nitrate removal is only by ecr the presence of pb ii ions has negative effects on nitrate removal in the simultaneous removal of lead ii and nitrate from wastewater acknowledgements this work was financially supported by pilot project of high level

hydrolysates usually have large surface area and are favorable for adsorption and trap of soluble compounds and colloidal particles at the same time hydrogen bubbles arising from cathode surface can capture and float suspended solids resulting in additional removal of pollutants furthermore oh produced in the cathode zone is also beneficial to pb ii precipitation finally lead ii was removed from aqueous medium by precipitation 29 30 2 2 electrochemical reduction ecr ecr of heavy metal ions and nitrate has attracted more and more attention since it is convenient environmental friendly and cost effective ecr of pollutants includes three steps adhering to the surface of cathode and then adopting electron directly or indirectly from cathode to form products and finally detaching with the generated products nitrate may be reduced to nitrogen gas or ammonium directly or nitrite as an intermediate to form nitrogen gas or ammonium eventually 31 possible reactions of nitrate on the cathode

difference lies on the proportion of nitrogen gas in the products according to the studies reported by murphy 33 and luk et al 36 the presence of nitrogen gas in products could be up to 95 under

pb ii and 12 mg n l 8 6 10 4 mol l of nitrate were prepared by dissolving kno3 and pb no3 2 in pure water diluted hno3 aqueous solution 0 1 mol l was used for ph adjustment when necessary all the chemicals were analytical reagent grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china 3 2 batch experiments batch experiments have been carried out to investigate simultaneous removal of lead ii and nitrate at low voltage external power source direct current used for the reactions was an electrochemical workstation in model chi 760e shanghai chenhua instruments china the cathode and anode were connected to the electrochemical workstation by insulated wires and then totally immersed into the reaction solution a saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode bulk of feed solution was 200 ml which was magnetically stirred at 650 rpm continuously during the process to maintain uniformity of the solution treated water was sampled at certain time interval and then filtered with 0 22 μm filters for nitrate and metal concentration determination different electrode distances applied potentials initial solution ph electrode materials were tested all the experiments were conducted for 2 h at room temperature 3 3 analytical methods the concentrations of lead ii aluminum and iron ions in all the water samples i e pb al and fe were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes thermo icap 6300 united states of america nitrate was measured by an ion chromatography ic metrohm mic switzerland the detection limits of nitrate and lead are 0 1 mg l and 0 001 mg l the ph values of solutions were monitored by a ph meter mettler toledo fe20 switzerland the morphology and chemical composition of the precipitates and the substances on electrode surfaces were analyzed before and after the reactions by scanning electron microscope phenom pro x holland energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds 4 results and discussions 4 1 effects of operating parameters as expected fig 1 shows that lead ii and nitrate removal achieved by using al or fe anode and cu cathode significantly decreased with the electrode distance being increased from 1 cm to 4 cm that is the current is decreased with the resistance being increased fewer lead ii and nitrates were removed to achieve significant and safe pollutant removal the electrode distance was fixed at 2 cm in later experiment in fig 1 it is also noticeable that two hour nitrate removal achieved by using aluminum and iron anodes decreased from 21 2 1 0 1 cm to 13 9 0 8 4 cm and 2 4 0 3 1 cm to 0 4 cm respectively undoubtedly such a difference of nitrate removal should be attributed to the use of aluminum and iron anodes and it has also been reported in previous studies 38 yehya et al 32 considered that the nitrate reduction was achieved through not only the ecr of nitrate on copper cathode eq 8 10 but also the cr on aluminum anode eq 19 21 in contrast the cr of nitrate on iron anode eq 15 and 16 has not been reported the effect of electrode distance on lead ii removal seems to be less than on nitrate removal this is mainly because pb were quite lower than no3 more than 90 of lead ii ions have been removed in the two hour treatment whatever anode iron or aluminum was used taking aluminum anode as an example the removal of lead ii ions decreased by about 3 2 from 98 2 1 2 to 95 0 1 6 when the electrode distance was increased from 1 cm to 4 cm by contrast it decreased by about 4 0 from 96 4 0 9 to 92 4 0 7 when using iron anode under analogous distance condition it can also be understood that lead ii ions have stronger electron capture ability of a standard electrode potential of pb2 pb0 at 298 k e p b 2 p b 0 0 0 13 v than nitrate ions no3 n2 0 96 v which will cause an easier removal via lead ii electrodeposition on copper cathode moreover lead ii ions also obtain electrons more easily from aluminum anode al3 al0 e a l 3 a l 0 0 1 66 v than from iron anode fe2 fe e f e 2 f e 0 0 0 44 v besides the electrodeposition on copper cathode eq 13 and the cr on iron and aluminum anodes eq 23 and 24 ec on aluminum anode is also a possible way of lead ii removal that is on the aluminum anode both cr as well as ec eq 24 would remove the lead ii ions lead ii and nitrate removal are two competitive processes so further investigation must be taken to clarify the roles of different routines in the simultaneous removal the effects of initial ph on simultaneous removal of lead ii and nitrate are shown in fig 2 iron cathode and aluminum anode were used it can be seen in fig 2 a that two hours treatment with an initial ph of 6 led to a nitrate removal efficiency of 20 5 0 8 while that with a ph of 4 demonstrated a little reduction to removal efficiency 19 7 1 5 when the initial ph was adjusted to 8 and 10 nitrate removal efficiencies increased to 21 7 0 2 and 22 6 1 6 respectively regarding lead ii removal fig 2 b shows that with initial ph 6 8 and 10 77 9 3 8 98 4 0 4 and 85 8 0 5 of pb ii ions were quickly removed in the first 10 min and the remaining pb ii was removed slowly the rate of lead ii removal was reduced significantly after the initiative rapid removal period first 10 min by contrast when initial ph was adjusted to 4 only 23 5 2 2 of pb ii ions were rapidly reduced in the first 30 min and after that the removal efficiency was slow down it is considered that hydrogen evolution will become easier and competitive with the ecr of lead ii and nitrate on cathode with reducing the solution ph values 17 further acidic condition is not conducive to the ec of pb ii ions near the anode due to absence of both the aluminum and iron amorphous precipitates formation and their role as pb ii absorber 17 therefore the solution ph was adjusted to 6 in later experiment actually it was observed in the experiment that with the initial ph being adjusted from 10 to 4 the removal of nitrate and pb2 was dropped from 22 6 1 6 to 19 7 1 5 and 98 9 1 3 to 32 4 0 3 respectively we have not found any flocculation at ph of 4 in our experiment therefore it is deduced that nitrate removal was not achieved via ec since the decrease was quite small when the ph was adjusted from 10 to 4 fig 2 a the sharp drop of lead ii removal with ph from 6 to 4 indicated that ec was one of the main ways for lead ii removal at ph higher than 6 fig 2 b the simultaneous removal of lead ii and nitrate also has been investigated at 2 4 6 and 8 v respectively by using cu cathode and al anode and the results are shown in fig 3 as expected the removal was increased and finally the maximum performance of both was achieved at 8 v that is the lead ii removal was improved about 3 from 94 7 2 8 97 7 1 4 while the nitrate removal although it was far lower than the lead ii removal increased about 11 times from 2 3 1 2 29 4 2 2 to obtain the reliable results of simultaneous removal of lead ii and nitrate at low power consumption condition a voltage of 6 v was applied in later experiments 4 2 analyses on different removal processes batch experiments using different electrodes e g aluminum iron and carbon paper electrolytes kno3 and pb no3 2 and voltages 0 8 v have been carried out to investigate the actual role of different processes in simultaneous removal of lead ii and nitrate all the experimental parameters and results are displayed in table 1 in which the overall removal efficiencies have been actually influenced by the synergy of multiple processes including ecr cr and ec 4 2 1 chemical and electrochemical reductions we can easily understand that ecr and ec occur only when a voltage is applied whereas cr will happen whether a voltage has been applied or not to clarify the ecr on cathode and cr on cathode and anode in lead ii and nitrate removal process carbon paper 2 cm 4 cm which has higher chemical inertness than aluminum and iron was employed as the anode and al or fe as the cathode therefore ec was completely depressed when no voltage was applied no 3 5 8 and 10 no current was observed and the occurrence of ecr was excluded theoretically cr became the only pathway for lead ii and nitrate removal experimental results in table 1 show that no nitrate removal could be observed when using aluminum no 3 and 5 or iron cathodes no 8 and 10 in pb no3 2 solution no 3 and 8 and kno3 solution no 5 and 10 whereas the lead ii removal on aluminum and iron cathodes was high up to 74 3 13 7 no 3 and 83 9 3 8 no 8 respectively there is no doubt that lead ii removal should be attributed to cr on the cathode we can deduce that whether a voltage has been applied or not lead ii ions will be more or less chemically reduced to zero valent pb on aluminum and iron electrodes cathode and even also anode moreover the experimental results in table 1 also show that when a voltage at as low as 6 v was applied the lead ii removal by using aluminum and iron cathodes with carbon paper anode went up to 94 9 0 4 no 2 and 95 9 0 8 no 7 respectively whereas nitrate removal remained quite low no 6 7 9 and 12 and even undetectable no 2 4 and 10 it is noticeable that there were two exceptions e g no 1 and no 11 in which the treatment using al anode and fe or al cathode showed to be more conducive to nitrate removal than that using fe anode at the same time lead ii removal also reached the maximum which was 99 6 0 1 for no 11 and 98 5 1 3 no 1 respectively from sem fig 4 a and eds fig 4b measurement no significant difference on morphology and chemical composition can be found on the al anode surface before and after water treatment so we conclude that pb ii can be easily removed from water by ecr and cr on the cathode sem and eds fig 4c confirmed the presence of pb on fe cathode surface the same evidence has also been observed on the al cathode but no more information is given here therefore we can understand that using al anode with fe cathode is conducive to make effective nitrate removal 4 2 2 electrocoagulation the occurrence of anodic oxidation can be observed on near al or fe anode under an applied voltage of 6 v no 1 6 11 and 12 after experiments al3 and fe3 2 ions were generated and then hydrolyzed or combined with hydroxyl to form flocculent amorphous suspensions amorphous iron and aluminum hydroxides produced at the anode are important scavengers for many metal ions due to their strong affinity for lead ii ions from large surface area porous structures and abundant binding sites 29 using aluminum and iron no 1 and 11 and no 6 and 12 respectively anode instead of carbon paper no 2 and 7 did enhance current density by more than 0 9 ma cm2 as previously mentioned in table 1 al anode exhibited higher lead ii and nitrate removal capacity than iron anode e g no 11 vs no 6 and no 1 vs no 12 ec is efficient for nitrate removal because nitrate ions can be adsorbed to a certain extent onto the surfaces of metal hydroxide precipitates 39 effluent fe ions in al fe reaction no 12 is notably high 0 69 mg l meaning that less fe hydroxides was formed during the process therefore nitrate removal efficiency is relatively lower than that in exp no 1 6 and 11 the morphology and composition on electrode surfaces before and after water treatment has been investigated by sem and eds the morphology comparison shows that aluminum and iron anode surfaces got rough after two hour water treatment no 1 6 11 and 12 for example in fe al reaction no 11 the deposition can be easily seen on used iron cathode fig 4d and table 2 as compared with the fresh one fig 4c moreover the eds analysis also confirmed the presence of lead ii on used iron cathode fig 4d and table 2 therefore we can conclude that cr ecr and ec are three main pathways for lead ii removal from water whereas ecr contributes the most to nitrate removal and cr and ec will do nothing 4 2 3 effluent metal ions and sludge generation world health organization who has ever set the maximum acceptable limits of aluminum and iron in drinking water which is 0 2 and 0 3 mg l respectively by icp oes analysis al and fe of most of effluents are below both of them with only one exception no 12 the sludge generation is another important factor in measuring the performance of a water treatment process the amount of generated sludge is related not only to the quality of influent but also to the applied voltage and electrode material in this study floccules had been observed in the reactions no 1 no 6 no 11 and no 12 and finally all were collected as sludge as shown in table 1 the fe fe reaction no 6 produced a maximum amount 205 9 15 1 kg m3 of sludge and the followings were al fe no 12 122 1 6 5 fe al no 11 72 0 2 8 and al al no 1 34 4 1 3 the use of al anodes generated less sludge than that of fe this is partly because iron has a higher molar mass 55 85 g than aluminum 26 98 g and the amounts of generated sludge should be relatively larger under the same current condition however no obvious correlation between sludge generation and others such as cathode material current density and removal efficiency can be confirmed in this study 5 conclusions based on the research findings obtained in this study the following conclusions can be drawn effective simultaneous removal of aqueous lead ii and nitrate by iron and aluminum can be made if the conditions e g electrode distance solution ph voltage and even electrode materials are controlled the optimal lead ii removal of 99 7 and nitrate removal of 57 6 can be achieved at ph 6 with low applied voltage of 6 v and electrode distance of 2 cm by using aluminum anode and iron cathode lead ii removal can be realized by chemical reduction electrochemical reduction and electrocoagulation whereas the nitrate removal is only by ecr the presence of pb ii ions has negative effects on nitrate removal in the simultaneous removal of lead ii and nitrate from wastewater acknowledgements this work was financially supported by pilot project of high level

14251,since 1950 the fisheries industry has increased with the growth of human population these industries produced highly loaded and brackish wastewaters without proper treatment these wastewaters can severely affect water bodies in this work we have studied the viability of the treatment of wastewaters generated during the evisceration process of the fish processing industry by using synthetic wastewater made of fish viscera chemical oxygen demand cod 2954 17 128 07 mg l1 treated under anaerobic sludge conditions in order to work at high saline conditions three feeds to microorganism ratio were tested 0 274 0 012 0 129 0 0055 and 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv 1 in order to improve the anaerobic reactor performance cod removal the maximum accumulated biogas and biogas yield were measured for testing the efficacy of the anaerobic sludge cod removal efficiencies were above 80 at the three salinities while biogas yield was reduced the salinity was increased from 0 to 20 g l 1 and a high feed to microorganism ratio 0 274 0 012 gcod gssv 1 was used the inhibitory effect also was observed at low f m ratio 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv 1 although biogas yield reached acceptable values biogas yield was reduced to 64 when salinity was increased from 0 to 20 g l 1 the research on the use of anaerobic sludge conditioned at high salinity shows a promising perspective for the treatment and exploitation of wastewater generated in the evisceration of fish revealing the need for corresponding optimization of the process to increase the yield in the production of biogas research on the use of anaerobic sludge conditioned at high salinity shows a promising scenario for the treatment and exploitation of evisceration wastewater with the corresponding optimization of the process to increase the production of biogas keywords anaerobic fish viscera feed to microorganism ratio saline wastewater 1 introduction since 1950 fish demand has grown significantly world per capita consumption increased from 6 1 kg in 1950 to 20 3 kg in 2016 to fulfill this demand in 2018 a total of 170 9 million tonnes mt were captured in water bodies i e sea lakes and rivers or were produced in fish farms this incremental demand has been caused by a combination of several factors like population growth rising incomes urbanization and the increased availability of these products generated by the expansion of aquaculture 1 2 during the processing of seafood different kinds of wastes are produced the composition of these wastes can vary with the processed species type of the process being carried out and final product viscera are part of these wastes and it is estimated that a proportion of 16 of the whole weight of the fish is viscera 3 4 this ratio can differ from one species to another season and fishing place viscera can be discarded to sea transported to a landfill or recovered for fishmeal ensilage or fish sauce production this gives viscera an added value for using it in the further process 3 4 however the wastewater generated in the evisceration process is the main objective of this study viscera can be washed out and end in the wastewater treatment facilities these wastewaters can contain a chemical oxygen demand cod concentration from 0 3 to 42 g l1 and solids concentrations of 6 which are caused mainly by blood and guts 5 these wastes have their environmental implications like oxygen abatement in water bodies eutrophication and odor problems 5 7 some authors have focused on studying the biodegradability of different streams generated in the fish processing industry by several wastewater treatment processes and they have found that biological treatment is a feasible option to depurate these wastes the aerobic process can achieve entirely organic depletion of wastewater from fish processing industry 8 10 a disadvantage of these processes is oxygen requirements for wastewater treatment which can be higher for wastewater from fish processing 11 also extended aeration time is needed with low organic loads resulting in high volume tanks and higher construction and operating costs 12 among all the existing wastewater treatment processes anaerobic treatment seems to be an effective process for treating wastewater from the fish processing industry 13 17 anaerobic processes have been successfully used for depuration of the fish processing industry wastewaters streams from the seafood canning industry has been treated effectively with anaerobic processes the reported chemical oxygen demand cod removals are in the range from 67 to 90 and methane ch4 productions are higher than 2 42 m3 ch4 per cubic meter of treated wastewaters per day 13 15 18 for the heavily polluted wastewaters like those from the fishmeal industries removal efficiencies range is between 70 and 80 with methanogenic activities reaching 1 0 g ch4 cod per gram of volatile suspended solids per day gvss d 1 the used organic loading rates olr are higher than those tested in the aerobic process 16 17 however the anaerobic treatment of these wastewaters is challenging due to their sodium chloride content which can cause plasmolysis in cells from osmotic stress 19 23 sodium na is the main inhibitory agent in these waters low concentrations of na 0 1 0 35 g l1 are necessary for bacterial growth concentrations ranging from 3 5 to 8 0 g l1 can induce to methanogenesis inhibition 21 23 most of the species used by the seafood industry are captured in sea waters and it is a common practice to use brine to freeze the seafood this brine also can be used to transport the capture through all the industrial process and end in a wastewater treatment plant in addition fish wastes are rich in protein what generates high amounts of ammonia both nitrogen and salt can inhibit anaerobic digestion and those are the principal reasons why anaerobic treatment has been poorly used to treat these kinds of wastes most of these wastes are used to make up other interesting products like collagen gelatin food supplements pharmaceutical products of interest they are used as feed in aqua and agriculture and or for the production of biofuels but it requires high investment costs and specialized equipment 24 a few studies have focused on the viability of biogas production from fish by products 25 27 however they focused their studies on improving methane production without considering the effect of salt in methane production in the present study the effectiveness of an anaerobic reactor which treats a saline wastewater prepared with fish wastes heads fins and viscera is tested in order to show an alternative for the disposal of these wastes instead of using them as raw materials in other costly processes three feeds to microorganism ratios were tested to see the effect in biogas production and cod removal the parameters used to measure the efficacy are biogas yield and cod removal efficiency 2 materials and methods all the methodology can be resumed in three steps fig 1 1 conditioning of anaerobic sludge to high salinity concentrations by stepwise incremental and by adding a marine sediment inoculum 2 substrate preparation with fish viscera collected in a local market 3 finally bio assays where cod removal efficiency and biogas production were followed 2 1 inoculum a granulated anaerobic sludge from a slaughterhouse treatment plant and marine sediment were used as seeds this inoculum has a total volatile solids tvs concentration of 22 9 g l1 the marine sediment was collected in mazatlán sinaloa mexico from an estuarine that receives fishmeal wastewater discharge 2 2 conditioning a conditioning period was employed to adapt biomass to high salinity and high olr the methodology for sludge adaptation to the salt concentrations above 20 g l1 was increasing with stepwise incremental followed by a slight reduction of salinity conditions the salinity was increased from 0 to 2 g l1 and let the sludge adapt for one week then the salinity was reduced to 1 g l1 and after 1 week of adaptation the salinity was increased again this methodology was used until the salt concentration reached 6 g l1 then the salinity was increased from 6 to 10 g l1 and the same methodology was used until a 20 g l1 salt was reached this step took 26 weeks see fig 2 28 2 3 substrate a synthetic wastewater made from fish wastes swf was used to emulate the properties of wastewater generated in the process of eviscerating the substrate was prepared from a concentration formulated with a mixture of viscera and blood from several fish species collected in a local market from this concentrate dilutions were made to reach cod concentrations of 2 95 0 13 g l1 these concentrations were within the range reported by show 5 the characteristics of the concentrations are shown in table 1 2 4 bio assays batch assays were made in triplicate and carried out in 310 ml glass bottles with an effective volume of 250 ml each bottle was provided with an ankom wireless gas production system module for measuring pressure in psi produced by the generated biogas inside the bottle the register of pressures was made in the ankom gas pressure monitor software fig 3 all the experiments were carried out at 35 0 1 c in a thermoagitator the pressure registered was used to determine the quantity of moles of biogas produced by using an equation for the ideal gas law eq 1 1 n p v r t where n is the quantity of biogas produced in moles mol p is the pressure kpa registered by the ankom wireless sensor v is the head space volume in the glass bottle 0 06 l t is the temperature k and r is the gas constant 8 314472 l kpa k1 mol 1 once the quantity of biogas is calculated with the equation for the ideal gas law the volume of the produced biogas is calculated by using avogadro s law and by considering that at atmospheric pressure 101 325 kpa in psi 1 psi 6 894757293 kpa and at temperature of 273 15 k 1 mole of biogas occupies 22 4 l with these considerations biogas moles can be converted into milliliters ml by using eq 2 2 b i o g a s m l n x 22 4 x 1000 where n is the moles of biogas calculated using eq 1 22 4 is the volume occupied by 1 mole of biogas finally 1000 is the conversion factor from l to ml the experimental setup was carried out by using different feeds to microorganism ratios f m where the swf was used as a substrate while the anaerobic sludge as was used as the biological consortia see table 2 the mean f m ratios were 0 274 0 012 0 129 0 0055 and 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv1 the experiments were made at salinities of 0 10 and 20 g l 1 with cod values of 3 1 0 051 2 86 0 069 and 2 90 0 11 gcod l 1 while tvs for the as was 22 9 g l 1 for all the experiments the experimental times used in the present study were from 33 to 48 h methane proportion was analyzed only for the best f m ratio that gives the highest biogas production results in order to see the methane composition of the produced biogas the measures were performed in a gas cromatographer gow mac series 580 the feed to microorganism ratio f m was calculated using eq 3 3 f m r a t i o g c o d g s s v 1 v o l s w f x c o d s w f v o l a s x t v s a s where v o l s w f is the added volume of the synthetic fish substrate c o d s w f is the chemical oxygen demand of de synthetic fish substrate v o l a s is the added volume of anaerobic sludge and t v s a s is the concentration of total volatile solids of the anaerobic sludge the bottles were placed in a thermos agitator at 35 c biogas production was measured every hour cod ph and salinity were measured at the beginning and at the end of the experiment cod ph conductivity ts and tvs were measured according to standard methods 29 3 results and discussion 3 1 cod removal efficiency at three f m ratios and three saline concentrations according to chen et al 21 and chowdhury et al 10 fish processing wastewaters are hardly treatable the main factors that affect cod removal efficiency and biogas production are salt and ammonia concentrations as mentioned before the inhibition caused by these parameters can be reduced if some strategies are carried out like an earlier acclimation period the anaerobic sludge used in this study was previously exposed to a 7 month period of incremental saline concentrations in order to reduce inhibition caused by salinity also the sludge was already conditioned to treat waters with high nitrogen content due to its previous usage in the treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater the treatment of fish processing wastewater has been reported in literature where high cod concentrations 1 to 70 g l 1 and retention times ranging from 72 to 660 h have been reported in the treatment of these wastewaters 13 16 18 30 31 fig 1 and table 3 show the initial and the final cods as well as the cod removals obtained by using the anaerobic sludge at different f m ratios and salinities it is observed that at a salinity of 0 g l1 the total cod removals achieved are between 93 7 and 94 7 with the batch experimental times bet of 46 h few studies have reported the biogas production from fish by products treated by anaerobic digester 25 27 however some other studies reported the performance of anaerobic processes that treat saline wastewater from the fish processing industry and they also reported similar cod removals at higher experimental times et 10 12 it was observed that when salinity was increased from 0 to 10 gl1 the reactor showed a slight abatement in cod degradation the removal efficiencies decreased from the mean value of 94 to 89 8 3 41 at bet which went from 33 to 48 h fig 4 the decrease in cod removal efficiency agrees with what has been already reported that an incremental in salt concentration can reduce significantly cod removal efficiency due to cell shrunken and plasmolysis 32 however some authors mentioned that the effect will depend on the characteristics of the inoculum and the type of wastewater making an emphasis on that using halophilic biomass it can reduce the inhibitory effect caused by nacl 25 33 34 in this study the anaerobic reactor was inoculated with marine sediment that provided with halophilic bacteria the anaerobic sludge so the inhibitory effect caused by salt on the cod removal efficiency was reduced the previous acclimation period of the anaerobic sludge can also reduce hrt reducing experimental times and costs as a result ets used in this study are lower than those reported by guerrero et al 16 prasertsan et al 13 vidal et al 17 and gebauer 30 who reported the use of ets between 96 and 660 h for the treatment of effluents from the fish processing industry finally at salinity of 20 g l1 the removal efficiencies decreased to ranges between 83 and 90 at this salinity the best removal efficiency was obtained at a low f m ratio cod removal was slightly affected by salt increment this was attributed according to kimata kino 19 to the adaptation of anaerobic bacteria to salt concentrations up to 20 g l 1 at this salinity acceptable cod removals and methane production can be obtained if the anaerobic sludge is previously exposed to small increments of wastewater with salt however they also mentioned that if salinity passes a threshold limit the anaerobic sludge will be permanently affected by salt inhibition agreeing with this vyrides and stuckey 35 reported that slight inhibition occurs in the anaerobic treatment of saline wastewaters at salinities below 20 g l 1 the bet employed in this study ranged between 33 to 48 h these bet are similar to those reported by mosquera corral et al 18 and puñal and lema 31 3 2 maximum accumulated biogas and biogas yield at three f m ratios and three saline concentrations fig 5a shows biogas behavior at three saline concentrations and different f m ratios 0 274 0 012 0 129 0 0055 and 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv1 according to lefebvre and moleta 12 at high salinities the use of low f m ratio can improve anaerobic reactor performance this agrees with the results obtained in this study as it can be observed in fig 5a maximum biogas was reached at f m ratio of 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv1 at the 3 salinities tested however it is well known that high salinity can reduce considerably the amount of the produced biogas in anaerobic digesters 10 12 21 in the present work at a salinity of 0 g l 1 the biogas yield was 0 52 0 54 and 1 28 l biogas kg 1 removed cod for the respective f m ratio of 0 274 0 012 0 129 0 0055 and 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv1 when salinity was increased to 10 g l 1 the obtained biogas yield values decreased to 0 30 0 40 and 0 54 l biogas kg 1 removed cod for the respective f m ratio finally when salinity was increased to 20 g l 1 the reduction in biogas yield due to the inhibition by salt reached 0 24 0 32 and 0 49 l biogas kg 1 removed cod the best biogas yield achieved was at an f m ratio of 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv1 methane proportion for this f m ratio was in the range of 45 to 50 it can be observed in fig 5 that when salinity increased from 10 to 20 g l1 biogas yield had no significant decrease this can be attributed to the low f m ratio used 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv 1 and the methanization inhibition caused by salt was reduced according to liu et al 36 high f m ratio in saline wastewaters can disturb hydrolyzation and methanization process also high f m ratios can allow the accumulation of toxic intermediates causing a synergetic inhibition effect with the already caused one by salinity 37 on the other hand a low f m ratio enhances organic removal and sludge flocculation and reduces inhibition caused by high salinity 36 cadavid rodríguez et al 38 mentioned that the best f m ratio for the highest biomethane production can be achieved at an f m ratio of 0 5 gcod gssv 1 however in their study the inhibitory effect caused by a high salinity was not considered the highest biogas production obtained in the present study was close to that obtained by eiroa et al 25 who obtained the highest biomethane productions at f m ratios of 0 05 gcod gssv 1 fig 6 shows biogas production of the adapted anaerobic sludge against sfw under three saline concentrations it can be observed that the maximum biogas production at 0 g l1 is significantly affected when salinity increases from 0 to 10 g l1 at a salinity of 0 g l1 the maximum accumulated biogas varied from 263 ml of biogas at high f m ratio to 334 ml at low f m ratio when salinity increases to 10 g l1 biogas production was in the range of 129 to 134 ml which represents a significant drop finally when salinity increases from 0 to 20 g l1 the maximum accumulated biogas shows the lowest production achieved from 98 1 to 114 5 ml this effect is mainly due to the partial inhibition of methanogenic bacteria caused by the high osmotic pressure that exists in the medium 12 21 it is important to mention that when salinity was increased from 10 to 20 g l1 a significant depletion on biogas production was not observed this can be attributed to the long previous conditioning period and to the marine sediment inoculum factors that were important for providing the sludge with halotolerant and halophilic biomass 17 23 39 41 despite the conditioning period anaerobic sludge suffered a significant inhibition of biogas production due to high salinity however this effect was reduced by changing f m ratio best biogas yield achieved at the three salinities was at low f m ratio 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv1 which agrees with what hadiyarto et al 42 reported in the treatment of offal disposals with an anaerobic reactor in wastewaters with high organic concentrations and in the presence of highly inhibitor agents such as nacl and ammonia it is important to use new strategies to avoid the effect that these compounds can cause despite the fact that biogas production was reduced at salinities above 10 g l 1 which agrees with lefebvre and molletta 12 reporting that at this salinity methanogenic production is strongly inhibited in this study it was demonstrated that at salinities of 20 g l 1 it was possible to produce a significant amount of biogas to consider the treatment of wastewater produced in the evisceration process in order to be treated by an anaerobic reactor also the reactor was able to remove above an 80 of the cod present in the inlet wastewater 4 conclusions in the present study it was tested the effect of salt concentration on an anaerobic process which treated synthetic fish processing wastewater prepared with fish disposals despite the inhibitory effect caused by high salinity from the synthetic wastewater the adapted anaerobic sludge was capable of removing cod from this wastewater at three different salinities acceptable cod removals and biogas production can be achieved if the correct methodology is applied in a previous conditioning period of the anaerobic sludge the inhibitory effect caused by salinity produced a significant reduction in the maximum accumulated biogas and biogas yield parameters after salinity was increased these effects were reduced by reducing the f m ratio to a value of 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv1 however if these f m ratios were applied in the treatment of these wastewaters it must be considered that this will considerably increase hrt acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge

14251,since 1950 the fisheries industry has increased with the growth of human population these industries produced highly loaded and brackish wastewaters without proper treatment these wastewaters can severely affect water bodies in this work we have studied the viability of the treatment of wastewaters generated during the evisceration process of the fish processing industry by using synthetic wastewater made of fish viscera chemical oxygen demand cod 2954 17 128 07 mg l1 treated under anaerobic sludge conditions in order to work at high saline conditions three feeds to microorganism ratio were tested 0 274 0 012 0 129 0 0055 and 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv 1 in order to improve the anaerobic reactor performance cod removal the maximum accumulated biogas and biogas yield were measured for testing the efficacy of the anaerobic sludge cod removal efficiencies were above 80 at the three salinities while biogas yield was reduced the salinity was increased from 0 to 20 g l 1 and a high feed to microorganism ratio 0 274 0 012 gcod gssv 1 was used the inhibitory effect also was observed at low f m ratio 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv 1 although biogas yield reached acceptable values biogas yield was reduced to 64 when salinity was increased from 0 to 20 g l 1 the research on the use of anaerobic sludge conditioned at high salinity shows a promising perspective for the treatment and exploitation of wastewater generated in the evisceration of fish revealing the need for corresponding optimization of the process to increase the yield in the production of biogas research on the use of anaerobic sludge conditioned at high salinity shows a promising scenario for the treatment and exploitation of evisceration wastewater with the corresponding optimization of the process to increase the production of biogas keywords anaerobic fish viscera feed to microorganism ratio saline wastewater 1 introduction since 1950 fish demand has grown significantly world per capita consumption increased from 6 1 kg in 1950 to 20 3 kg in 2016 to fulfill this demand in 2018 a total of 170 9 million tonnes mt were captured in water bodies i e sea lakes and rivers or were produced in fish farms this incremental demand has been caused by a combination of several factors like population growth rising incomes urbanization and the increased availability of these products generated by the expansion of aquaculture 1 2 during the processing of seafood different kinds of wastes are produced the composition of these wastes can vary with the processed species type of the process being carried out and final product viscera are part of these wastes and it is estimated that a proportion of 16 of the whole weight of the fish is viscera 3 4 this ratio can differ from one species to another season and fishing place viscera can be discarded to sea transported to a landfill or recovered for fishmeal ensilage or fish sauce production this gives viscera an added value for using it in the further process 3 4 however the wastewater generated in the evisceration process is the main objective of this study viscera can be washed out and end in the wastewater treatment facilities these wastewaters can contain a chemical oxygen demand cod concentration from 0 3 to 42 g l1 and solids concentrations of 6 which are caused mainly by blood and guts 5 these wastes have their environmental implications like oxygen abatement in water bodies eutrophication and odor problems 5 7 some authors have focused on studying the biodegradability of different streams generated in the fish processing industry by several wastewater treatment processes and they have found that biological treatment is a feasible option to depurate these wastes the aerobic process can achieve entirely organic depletion of wastewater from fish processing industry 8 10 a disadvantage of these processes is oxygen requirements for wastewater treatment which can be higher for wastewater from fish processing 11 also extended aeration time is needed with low organic loads resulting in high volume tanks and higher construction and operating costs 12 among all the existing wastewater treatment processes anaerobic treatment seems to be an effective process for treating wastewater from the fish processing industry 13 17 anaerobic processes have been successfully used for depuration of the fish processing industry wastewaters streams from the seafood canning industry has been treated effectively with anaerobic processes the reported chemical oxygen demand cod removals are in the range from 67 to 90 and methane ch4 productions are higher than 2 42 m3 ch4 per cubic meter of treated wastewaters per day 13 15 18 for the heavily polluted wastewaters like those from the fishmeal industries removal efficiencies range is between 70 and 80 with methanogenic activities reaching 1 0 g ch4 cod per gram of volatile suspended solids per day gvss d 1 the used organic loading rates olr are higher than those tested in the aerobic process 16 17 however the anaerobic treatment of these wastewaters is challenging due to their sodium chloride content which can cause plasmolysis in cells from osmotic stress 19 23 sodium na is the main inhibitory agent in these waters low concentrations of na 0 1 0 35 g l1 are necessary for bacterial growth concentrations ranging from 3 5 to 8 0 g l1 can induce to methanogenesis inhibition 21 23 most of the species used by the seafood industry are captured in sea waters and it is a common practice to use brine to freeze the seafood this brine also can be used to transport the capture through all the industrial process and end in a wastewater treatment plant in addition fish wastes are rich in protein what generates high amounts of ammonia both nitrogen and salt can inhibit anaerobic digestion and those are the principal reasons why anaerobic treatment has been poorly used to treat these kinds of wastes most of these wastes are used to make up other interesting products like collagen gelatin food supplements pharmaceutical products of interest they are used as feed in aqua and agriculture and or for the production of biofuels but it requires high investment costs and specialized equipment 24 a few studies have focused on the viability of biogas production from fish by products 25 27 however they focused their studies on improving methane production without considering the effect of salt in methane production in the present study the effectiveness of an anaerobic reactor which treats a saline wastewater prepared with fish wastes heads fins and viscera is tested in order to show an alternative for the disposal of these wastes instead of using them as raw materials in other costly processes three feeds to microorganism ratios were tested to see the effect in biogas production and cod removal the parameters used to measure the efficacy are biogas yield and cod removal efficiency 2 materials and methods all the methodology can be resumed in three steps fig 1 1 conditioning of anaerobic sludge to high salinity concentrations by stepwise incremental and by adding a marine sediment inoculum 2 substrate preparation with fish viscera collected in a local market 3 finally bio assays where cod removal efficiency and biogas production were followed 2 1 inoculum a granulated anaerobic sludge from a slaughterhouse treatment plant and marine sediment were used as seeds this inoculum has a total volatile solids tvs concentration of 22 9 g l1 the marine sediment was collected in mazatlán sinaloa mexico from an estuarine that receives fishmeal wastewater discharge 2 2 conditioning a conditioning period was employed to adapt biomass to high salinity and high olr the methodology for sludge adaptation to the salt concentrations above 20 g l1 was increasing with stepwise incremental followed by a slight reduction of salinity conditions the salinity was increased from 0 to 2 g l1 and let the sludge adapt for one week then the salinity was reduced to 1 g l1 and after 1 week of adaptation the salinity was increased again this methodology was used until the salt concentration reached 6 g l1 then the salinity was increased from 6 to 10 g l1 and the same methodology was used until a 20 g l1 salt was reached this step took 26 weeks see fig 2 28 2 3 substrate a synthetic wastewater made from fish wastes swf was used to emulate the properties of wastewater generated in the process of eviscerating the substrate was prepared from a concentration formulated with a mixture of viscera and blood from several fish species collected in a local market from this concentrate dilutions were made to reach cod concentrations of 2 95 0 13 g l1 these concentrations were within the range reported by show 5 the characteristics of the concentrations are shown in table 1 2 4 bio assays batch assays were made in triplicate and carried out in 310 ml glass bottles with an effective volume of 250 ml each bottle was provided with an ankom wireless gas production system module for measuring pressure in psi produced by the generated biogas inside the bottle the register of pressures was made in the ankom gas pressure monitor software fig 3 all the experiments were carried out at 35 0 1 c in a thermoagitator the pressure registered was used to determine the quantity of moles of biogas produced by using an equation for the ideal gas law eq 1 1 n p v r t where n is the quantity of biogas produced in moles mol p is the pressure kpa registered by the ankom wireless sensor v is the head space volume in the glass bottle 0 06 l t is the temperature k and r is the gas constant 8 314472 l kpa k1 mol 1 once the quantity of biogas is calculated with the equation for the ideal gas law the volume of the produced biogas is calculated by using avogadro s law and by considering that at atmospheric pressure 101 325 kpa in psi 1 psi 6 894757293 kpa and at temperature of 273 15 k 1 mole of biogas occupies 22 4 l with these considerations biogas moles can be converted into milliliters ml by using eq 2 2 b i o g a s m l n x 22 4 x 1000 where n is the moles of biogas calculated using eq 1 22 4 is the volume occupied by 1 mole of biogas finally 1000 is the conversion factor from l to ml the experimental setup was carried out by using different feeds to microorganism ratios f m where the swf was used as a substrate while the anaerobic sludge as was used as the biological consortia see table 2 the mean f m ratios were 0 274 0 012 0 129 0 0055 and 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv1 the experiments were made at salinities of 0 10 and 20 g l 1 with cod values of 3 1 0 051 2 86 0 069 and 2 90 0 11 gcod l 1 while tvs for the as was 22 9 g l 1 for all the experiments the experimental times used in the present study were from 33 to 48 h methane proportion was analyzed only for the best f m ratio that gives the highest biogas production results in order to see the methane composition of the produced biogas the measures were performed in a gas cromatographer gow mac series 580 the feed to microorganism ratio f m was calculated using eq 3 3 f m r a t i o g c o d g s s v 1 v o l s w f x c o d s w f v o l a s x t v s a s where v o l s w f is the added volume of the synthetic fish substrate c o d s w f is the chemical oxygen demand of de synthetic fish substrate v o l a s is the added volume of anaerobic sludge and t v s a s is the concentration of total volatile solids of the anaerobic sludge the bottles were placed in a thermos agitator at 35 c biogas production was measured every hour cod ph and salinity were measured at the beginning and at the end of the experiment cod ph conductivity ts and tvs were measured according to standard methods 29 3 results and discussion 3 1 cod removal efficiency at three f m ratios and three saline concentrations according to chen et al 21 and chowdhury et al 10 fish processing wastewaters are hardly treatable the main factors that affect cod removal efficiency and biogas production are salt and ammonia concentrations as mentioned before the inhibition caused by these parameters can be reduced if some strategies are carried out like an earlier acclimation period the anaerobic sludge used in this study was previously exposed to a 7 month period of incremental saline concentrations in order to reduce inhibition caused by salinity also the sludge was already conditioned to treat waters with high nitrogen content due to its previous usage in the treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater the treatment of fish processing wastewater has been reported in literature where high cod concentrations 1 to 70 g l 1 and retention times ranging from 72 to 660 h have been reported in the treatment of these wastewaters 13 16 18 30 31 fig 1 and table 3 show the initial and the final cods as well as the cod removals obtained by using the anaerobic sludge at different f m ratios and salinities it is observed that at a salinity of 0 g l1 the total cod removals achieved are between 93 7 and 94 7 with the batch experimental times bet of 46 h few studies have reported the biogas production from fish by products treated by anaerobic digester 25 27 however some other studies reported the performance of anaerobic processes that treat saline wastewater from the fish processing industry and they also reported similar cod removals at higher experimental times et 10 12 it was observed that when salinity was increased from 0 to 10 gl1 the reactor showed a slight abatement in cod degradation the removal efficiencies decreased from the mean value of 94 to 89 8 3 41 at bet which went from 33 to 48 h fig 4 the decrease in cod removal efficiency agrees with what has been already reported that an incremental in salt concentration can reduce significantly cod removal efficiency due to cell shrunken and plasmolysis 32 however some authors mentioned that the effect will depend on the characteristics of the inoculum and the type of wastewater making an emphasis on that using halophilic biomass it can reduce the inhibitory effect caused by nacl 25 33 34 in this study the anaerobic reactor was inoculated with marine sediment that provided with halophilic bacteria the anaerobic sludge so the inhibitory effect caused by salt on the cod removal efficiency was reduced the previous acclimation period of the anaerobic sludge can also reduce hrt reducing experimental times and costs as a result ets used in this study are lower than those reported by guerrero et al 16 prasertsan et al 13 vidal et al 17 and gebauer 30 who reported the use of ets between 96 and 660 h for the treatment of effluents from the fish processing industry finally at salinity of 20 g l1 the removal efficiencies decreased to ranges between 83 and 90 at this salinity the best removal efficiency was obtained at a low f m ratio cod removal was slightly affected by salt increment this was attributed according to kimata kino 19 to the adaptation of anaerobic bacteria to salt concentrations up to 20 g l 1 at this salinity acceptable cod removals and methane production can be obtained if the anaerobic sludge is previously exposed to small increments of wastewater with salt however they also mentioned that if salinity passes a threshold limit the anaerobic sludge will be permanently affected by salt inhibition agreeing with this vyrides and stuckey 35 reported that slight inhibition occurs in the anaerobic treatment of saline wastewaters at salinities below 20 g l 1 the bet employed in this study ranged between 33 to 48 h these bet are similar to those reported by mosquera corral et al 18 and puñal and lema 31 3 2 maximum accumulated biogas and biogas yield at three f m ratios and three saline concentrations fig 5a shows biogas behavior at three saline concentrations and different f m ratios 0 274 0 012 0 129 0 0055 and 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv1 according to lefebvre and moleta 12 at high salinities the use of low f m ratio can improve anaerobic reactor performance this agrees with the results obtained in this study as it can be observed in fig 5a maximum biogas was reached at f m ratio of 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv1 at the 3 salinities tested however it is well known that high salinity can reduce considerably the amount of the produced biogas in anaerobic digesters 10 12 21 in the present work at a salinity of 0 g l 1 the biogas yield was 0 52 0 54 and 1 28 l biogas kg 1 removed cod for the respective f m ratio of 0 274 0 012 0 129 0 0055 and 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv1 when salinity was increased to 10 g l 1 the obtained biogas yield values decreased to 0 30 0 40 and 0 54 l biogas kg 1 removed cod for the respective f m ratio finally when salinity was increased to 20 g l 1 the reduction in biogas yield due to the inhibition by salt reached 0 24 0 32 and 0 49 l biogas kg 1 removed cod the best biogas yield achieved was at an f m ratio of 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv1 methane proportion for this f m ratio was in the range of 45 to 50 it can be observed in fig 5 that when salinity increased from 10 to 20 g l1 biogas yield had no significant decrease this can be attributed to the low f m ratio used 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv 1 and the methanization inhibition caused by salt was reduced according to liu et al 36 high f m ratio in saline wastewaters can disturb hydrolyzation and methanization process also high f m ratios can allow the accumulation of toxic intermediates causing a synergetic inhibition effect with the already caused one by salinity 37 on the other hand a low f m ratio enhances organic removal and sludge flocculation and reduces inhibition caused by high salinity 36 cadavid rodríguez et al 38 mentioned that the best f m ratio for the highest biomethane production can be achieved at an f m ratio of 0 5 gcod gssv 1 however in their study the inhibitory effect caused by a high salinity was not considered the highest biogas production obtained in the present study was close to that obtained by eiroa et al 25 who obtained the highest biomethane productions at f m ratios of 0 05 gcod gssv 1 fig 6 shows biogas production of the adapted anaerobic sludge against sfw under three saline concentrations it can be observed that the maximum biogas production at 0 g l1 is significantly affected when salinity increases from 0 to 10 g l1 at a salinity of 0 g l1 the maximum accumulated biogas varied from 263 ml of biogas at high f m ratio to 334 ml at low f m ratio when salinity increases to 10 g l1 biogas production was in the range of 129 to 134 ml which represents a significant drop finally when salinity increases from 0 to 20 g l1 the maximum accumulated biogas shows the lowest production achieved from 98 1 to 114 5 ml this effect is mainly due to the partial inhibition of methanogenic bacteria caused by the high osmotic pressure that exists in the medium 12 21 it is important to mention that when salinity was increased from 10 to 20 g l1 a significant depletion on biogas production was not observed this can be attributed to the long previous conditioning period and to the marine sediment inoculum factors that were important for providing the sludge with halotolerant and halophilic biomass 17 23 39 41 despite the conditioning period anaerobic sludge suffered a significant inhibition of biogas production due to high salinity however this effect was reduced by changing f m ratio best biogas yield achieved at the three salinities was at low f m ratio 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv1 which agrees with what hadiyarto et al 42 reported in the treatment of offal disposals with an anaerobic reactor in wastewaters with high organic concentrations and in the presence of highly inhibitor agents such as nacl and ammonia it is important to use new strategies to avoid the effect that these compounds can cause despite the fact that biogas production was reduced at salinities above 10 g l 1 which agrees with lefebvre and molletta 12 reporting that at this salinity methanogenic production is strongly inhibited in this study it was demonstrated that at salinities of 20 g l 1 it was possible to produce a significant amount of biogas to consider the treatment of wastewater produced in the evisceration process in order to be treated by an anaerobic reactor also the reactor was able to remove above an 80 of the cod present in the inlet wastewater 4 conclusions in the present study it was tested the effect of salt concentration on an anaerobic process which treated synthetic fish processing wastewater prepared with fish disposals despite the inhibitory effect caused by high salinity from the synthetic wastewater the adapted anaerobic sludge was capable of removing cod from this wastewater at three different salinities acceptable cod removals and biogas production can be achieved if the correct methodology is applied in a previous conditioning period of the anaerobic sludge the inhibitory effect caused by salinity produced a significant reduction in the maximum accumulated biogas and biogas yield parameters after salinity was increased these effects were reduced by reducing the f m ratio to a value of 0 077 0 0035 gcod gssv1 however if these f m ratios were applied in the treatment of these wastewaters it must be considered that this will considerably increase hrt acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge

indirectly affect our lifestyle in various ways regarding the last point lack of clean and accessible water in many areas around the world has increased the demand for developing new technologies to treat wastewater 1 3 antibiotics are a big part of drugs that are extensively used in the treatment of human and veterinary infections different studies have found that approximately 15 of the total drugs used are antibiotics 2 among types of antibiotics tetracycline tc falls in the second group which is produced and consumed by humans worldwide 4 it is one of the most widely used antibiotics as poultry medicine as well as in the treatment of human infection according to the previous studies the registered consumption of antibiotics worldwide was 100 to 200 thousand tons year 5 6 for example iran is among the top 20 countries as a consumer market of antibiotics 7 furthermore the annual consumption of tc compounds for livestock in the usa is expected to be around 3200 tons 8 additionally tc is generally used to treat several bacterial infections that widely spread in veterinary and agricultural fields a chronic bronchitis b brucella infections c chlamydia d mycoplasma acne and e legiruses 9 due to the wide range consumption of antibiotics studied labeled tc the routine compound 10 11 this antibiotic has four cyclic rings with an active carboxy amide group 8 12 although antibiotics are useful still some hazardous one in the aquatic environment can cause serious pollution 13 antibiotics are mainly introduced into aquatic environment via the disposal of bad quality wastewater effluents from pharmaceutical industries which are regarded the main source of antibiotic compounds in water bodies 14 more than that a significant amount of unused or residual drugs have been found in sewage and municipal wastewater treated effluent 15 the processes of chlorination or ozonation of wastewater loaded with pharmaceutical compounds may produce harmful by product chemicals which may be dangerous and carcinogenetic to humans 16 therefore eliminating these antibiotics from the sewage system before being discharged to aquatic environment has become essential 17 currently advanced oxidation gained intensive interest by researchers since this advanced treatment technology proved to be more efficient in the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds than other treatment processes 9 18 19 due to the production of high reactive radical compounds in the advanced oxidation treatment method the target pollutants are converted to low risk materials 20 21 the most tertiary wastewater treatment type of oxidation process is the fenton like oxidation process homogenous fenton like which proved to have a great potential for the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds 21 this method in principle uses ferric catalyst and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as a strong oxidant agent the product of hydroxide radical oh which results from a rapid decomposition reaction of h2o2 22 24 the oh radicals generated during the fenton like oxidation reactions have high degradation ability toward organic pollutants and can decompose them to water and carbon dioxide 25 26 throughout the past few years the integration of the fenton like treatment method together with other advanced treatment processes like the adsorption process were suggested by several scientific workers to be helpful in eradicating wastewater loaded with organic pollutants 27 however several drawbacks were highlighted that includes a production of too much sludge b leaving iron which reacts with hydrogen peroxide while undergoing conversion into ferric iron c using radicals produced in high concentrations d changing wastewater color after treatment and e the need for a permanent source of fe ii 26 28 29 therefore to solve these problems the heterogeneous fenton like technique was suggested as an alternative oxidation process for the homogeneous fenton like treatment method which assists in resolving problems related to ferric iron and sludge production 18 30 in contrast to the homogeneous fenton process the heterogeneous type process can be applied to either acidic or basic medium 31 32 among several materials which have been applied recently as a catalyst in this method such as feni3 nanoparticles mn3o4 clay zeolite coated with nanoparticles z scheme bi2fe4o9 bi2wo6 and carbon 25 33 35 feni3 nanosized particles are one of the most promising catalyst material to remediate contaminants therefore this type of catalysts attracted the attention of researchers because of simplicity in synthesis and operation effectiveness toward organic compounds within a wide range of operational conditions in addition to easily separate the magnetic nanoparticles using an external magnetic field 36 the proposed mechanism for heterogeneous fenton like oxidation process that employs feni3 nanoparticles as a catalyst can be described as follows 32 1 fe 3 h2o2 fe 3h2o2 2 fe 3h2o2 fe 3 ho2 h 3 fe 3 ho2 fe 2 o2 h 4 fe 2 h2o2 fe 3 oh oh to improve the catalytic activity of feni3 nanoparticles sio2 could be utilized to coat these nanoparticles thereby forming feni3 sio2 core shell 37 the coated sio2 particles act as a peroxidase like catalyst material that can accelerate the h2o2 decomposition into oh radicals thus improving the degradation rate of organic contaminants additionally sio2 can raise the degradation rate of pollutants since this material has a high number of active groups such as hydroxyl bonds 38 39 and nh bending vibration 40 that can enhance the adsorption of pollutants onto nanoparticles used as catalyst which will be degraded later 41 42 lu et al 2016 there are only a few studies that enriched the literature with regard to the application of feni3 sio2 magnetic nanoparticles as a catalyst to remove tc antibiotic from the contaminated wastewater therefore the present study aims to investigate the potential application of using feni3 sio2 magnetic nanoparticles as a catalyst to degrade the tc in advanced tertiary treatment unit i e heterogeneous fenton like process initially the characterization study was performed together with subsequent investigation of the effect of several environmental parameters ph initial tc concentration reaction time catalyst dose and h2o2 concentration on the tc degradation mechanism in addition a detailed study was conducted to describe the kinetic mechanism of the degradation process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals in the current study highly pure and laboratory grade chemicals were used as received from the manufacturer fecl2 4h2o nicl2 6h2o n2h4 h2o sic8h20o4 and ho c2h4o nh were procured from merck while the powder of tc chemical formula c22h24o8n2 hcl molecular weight 480 9 g mol solubility 0 041 mol l and purity 95 was procured from sigma aldrich moreover preparation and dilution of the tc stock 1000 mg l and all other working solutions used throughout the steps of experiments was carried out using deionized water in order to prevent loss in the stability of the antibiotics and to keep the antibiotic safe the solutions prepared were stored in a dark place at a temperature 4 c to be used in experiments for a maximal period of 10 days in order to control the ph value during the experimental time hcl and naoh of 1 n were used fig 1 depicts the chemical structure of tc molecule 2 2 synthesis of catalyst the synthesis process of feni3 sio2 magnetic nanoparticles was conducted in two stages according to the following methodology 43 44 polyethylene glycol surfactant of quantity 1 0 g was mixed with 180 ml of deionized water at constant stirring till completely dissolved similarly another two solutions were separately prepared from the dissolving of 0 713 g nicl2 6h2o and 0 188 g fecl2 4h2o in 10 ml of deionized water these two solutions were simultaneously added to the earlier prepared polyethylene glycol solution the resultant mixture was stirred with naoh 80 concentration until ph of solution reaches between 12 and 13 afterward 1 9 ml of hydrazine hydrate n2h4 h2o was added to this suspension with vigorous stirring at room temperature for 24 h the separation of the solid nanoparticles of feni3 from the solution was carried out using magnet followed by thorough washing with deionized water until the ph becomes close to neutral value and was subsequently dried at 80 c for 8 h at this stage the feni3 nanoparticles were obtained according to the procedure suggested by yang et al 37 lu et al 43 and and in order to shell feni3 nanoparticles with sio2 the following experimental steps were taken first about 0 5 g of prepared feni3 particles was dispersed in a solution containing 2 0 ml of ammonia 28 80 ml of ethanol 99 7 and 20 ml of deionized water in the second step 1 0 ml of tetraethyl ortho silicate solution was added to the above solution drop wise the resultant mixture was shaken at 500 rpm at room temperature for 24 h using an incubator shaker it is worth mentioning that tetraethyl ortho silicate was hydrolyzed in alcohol methanol or ethanol in the presence of ammonia as a catalyst thus the resulting feni3 sio2 magnetic nanoparticles obtained were washed for several times with ethanol and then with deionized water in order to remove any impurities then separated by a magnetic source and finally dried at 60 c till the content is completely dried 2 3 characterization of the catalyst both feni3 and feni3 sio2 nanoparticles were characterized using various devices the surfaces morphology was examined using transmission electron microscopy tem and field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem high resolution images captured via a scanner zeiss em10c 100 kv germany furthermore analyzing the functional groups fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra was investigated using avatar spectroscopy instrument usa magnetism property of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles was analyzed using a vsm model 7400 vsm while brunauer emmett teller bet analysis was used to estimate the pore volume value and the specific surface area of the prepared nanoparticles using belsorp mini ii high precision analyzer additionally to identify the crystalline structure of the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the synthesized catalyst were obtained using x ray diffractometer xpert pro panalytical co netherland with high power cuk α radiation maintained at the scan rate of 2 degrees minute 2 4 the experiments of tc degradation in the present study all the degradation experiments of tc in the heterogeneous fenton like reactor were conducted in a batch equilibrium system using several glass flasks of 500 ml with controlling the following conditions 200 ml of tc solution ambient temperature of 20 1 c agitation speed of 500 rpm the tc degradation was examined by varying ph 3 9 initial tc concentration 10 30 mg l reaction time up to 180 min amount of feni3 sio2 magnetic nanoparticles in the tc solution 0 005 0 1 g l and h2o2 concentration 50 200 mg l at a specific reaction or equilibrium time suspensions each of 2 ml were withdrawn carefully from each flask and centrifuged then the separated solutions were tested for the remaining tc concentration the initial and residual non degraded tc concentration in the tested samples were analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometer model t80 pg instrument ltd uk at a wavelength of 358 nm the degradation data obtained from the study of effect of initial tc concentration on its degradation process were used to fit of the kinetic model notably all the results of degradation tests were listed as averaged values of triplicate analysis the degradation percentage r of tc can be determined using eq 5 where c 0 and c e are the initial and non degraded tc concentrations mg l respectively in the supernatant after centrifuging 5 r c 0 c e c 0 100 2 5 kinetic model generally a kinetic study of reaction rate of organic pollutants is essential for the degradation treatment method such as fenton like process and also important to investigate the performance of the used catalytic in the purification treatment system 45 furthermore the study of mathematical modeling of the experimental kinetics data using familiar kinetic models is important for accurately design of the treatment system within this context the most popular kinetic model used for modeling the degradation data of organic materials is the pseudo first order 46 47 which is illustrated in its linear form in eq 6 below it is worth mentioning that the accuracy of suitability between the applied kinetic models and the experimental data is being evaluated according to the result values of the regression coefficient r2 the half life time t 1 2 of tc degradation corresponding to c t c 0 0 5 is calculated using the eq 7 41 6 ln c t c 0 k t 7 t 1 2 0 693 k where k is the rate constant min 1 and c t denotes to the measured tc concentration mg l at specific reaction or degradation time t min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of catalyst results of the bet analysis fig 2 revealed that the specific surface area and the total pore volume of the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles were 481 58 m2 g and 0 2 cm3 g respectively such results indicate good catalytical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles due to the fact that particles of large surface areas provide plentiful active sites thus improving oxidation rate of pollutant molecules into the used catalyst 48 36 according to the results obtained via n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles sample fig 2a the used catalyst is a mesoporous structure material which can be specified as classical type iv 49 in addition the steep jump loop observed at a relative pressure p p0 range 0 89 0 99 refers to inter crystalline voids of the synthesized nanoparticles 50 fig 2b represents the barrett joyner and halenda bjh plot for the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles sample which implies that the pore radius is probably around 12 nm the results obtained from magnetization analysis see fig 3 demonstrated that the feni3 sio2 nanoparticle has super paramagnetic properties as its saturation magnetization equaled to 69 69 electrostatic unit g moreover this property facilitates the separation of the feni3 sio2 nanoparticle in the presence of an external magnetic source fig 4 shows the xrd patterns of feni3 and feni3 sio2 nanoparticles generally these patterns are help to identify the approximate crystalline size and structure of the used solid materials based on the scherrer equation eq 8 the average crystallite size l of feni3 and feni3 sio2 particles was 10 and 45 nm respectively 51 the crystalline structure at 2θ 75 5 51 7 and 44 5 represent the structure of feni3 the longitudinal axis of 2θ 25 10 corresponds to amorphous silica that appeared due to the existence of the si layer in the synthesized feni3 sio2 nanoparticles catalyst 52 from another side it could be clearly noticed that there was no significant shift of typical diffraction peaks of feni3 and feni3 sio2 nanoparticles indicating that no detectable damage or change in the chemical structure of the feni3 after being coated with sio2 particles 8 l k λ β cos θ where k is the crystallite shape constant which ranges between 0 62 2 08 normally taken as 0 89 λ nm is xrd radiation wavelength β radians refers to the half maximal peak width located at any 2θ radians in the xrd pattern the ft ir analysis of feni3 and feni3 sio2 nanoparticles can be visualized in fig 5 the ft ir peaks at 447 44 cm 1 in feni3 and 804 54 669 69 and 479 82 cm 1 in feni3 sio2 are correspond to the tensile vibrations of metal pillars of fe ni ni fe ni or fe ni ni groups 52 the two strong bands found in the ft ir spectra of feni3 sio2 at 1124 05 and 972 05 cm 1 denote the existence of si o si of silica group or specify the formation si o ni formation and si o fe functional groups resulting from si bonding with the fe and ni metal nanoparticles during successful synthesis of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles 53 the weak absorption band detected in the feni3 ft ir spectrum at 3348 99 and feni3 sio2 at 3382 97 cm 1 belongs to the negatively charged hydroxyl oh active group 52 54 notably oh group belongs to physisorbed water molecules in the pores of sio2 38 55 the apparent grain and internal structures of the feni3 sio2 were investigated by taking fe sem and tem images at a scale bar of 200 and 100 nm respectively see fig 6 the fe sem image reveals that the surface of feni3 sio2 is an irregularly shaped agglomerated nanoparticles while most of them are spherical the size of these particles is within the range of nanoscale which in turn indicates that the synthesis of nanoparticles has a strong tendency to undergo agglomeration due to their high magnetic property as presented in fig 3 moreover several morphology features of feni3 sio2 apperead like the coarse surface of this catalyst and contains a lot of grooves the visualization of small pores was also feasible thus these significant features facilitate tc degradation onto the external and internal pore reaction sites on the surface of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles since these characteristics increase the surface area of the catalyst for contaminant reaction according to the high resolution tem micrograph the nanoparticles of feni3 sio2 have a size of 40 70 nm 3 2 effect of ph in the fenton like process applications the removal efficiency must be examined at different values of solution ph since this parameter can influence the degradation process of pollutants in several ways because oh has a relatively lower redox potential in basic medium h2o2 may be consumed without production of oh 56 57 in addition the dissolution property of the antibiotic molecules and surface charge of the utilized catalyst can also influence the degradation process in this current direction the analysis of the ph of point zero charge phpzc determination reveals that the phpzc of feni3 sio2 is close to 7 5 fig 7 a thus the surfaces of the prepared catalyst above this value will be saturated with negative charges coming from surplus oh ions moreover the dominant feni3 sio2 functional groups of negative charges may get protonated by h protons at solution ph phpzc fig 7b shows the variation of tc degradation efficiency as a function of solution ph the results showed that the highest removal efficiency 53 72 was at neutral ph hence it is an attractive property that makes feni3 sio2 a favorable and eco friendly catalyst for the removal of tc in the advanced oxidation units since almost all surface water resources and wastewater approximately have neutral ph 50 58 this phenomenon can be related to the nature of sio2 that covers feni3 nanoparticle 41 59 at ph phpzc the oh ions are combined with the fe 3 to produce iron hydroxide deposits thereby reducing the availability of active groups of the catalyst significantly thus the reaction of tc molecules onto the surface of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles may be inhibited leading to a decrease in the number of degraded tc molecules literature reported that tc molecule was an amphoteric organic chemical containing three functional groups two acidic which are tricarbonyl amide and phenolic diketone groups and one basic represented by dimethyl amine group 60 according to solution ph various tc species will be predominated see fig 1 at ph 3 30 pka1 tc molecules may mainly present as fully protonated h4tc while at 3 30 ph 7 68 pka2 the majority of tc molecules are presented as neutral h3tc0 species in addition at 7 68 ph 9 70 pka3 this antibiotic exists as h2tc and at ph 9 70 the tc 2 will be the predominating species of tc molecules 41 noticeably the activity of h2o2 and radical species is enhanced in case of existence of tc and tc2 higher than tc 60 it should also be emphasized that the concentration of h protons increases with the decrease of ph thus leading to in competition between the protons and the tc molecules for the negatively charged sites of the catalyst furthermore at low ph value the increase in the h concentration leads to the formation of oh2 species which makes the catalyst surface positive and that leads to the repulsion of the tc molecules via electrostatic forces in the fenton like treatment process studying the effect of solution ph is essential for a investigating the removal efficiency of the target contaminant b understanding the chemical reaction that occurs during the oxidation process in this context one should note the relatively high solubility of h2o2 during oxidation processes at neutral ph therefore the fe 3 in the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles plays a vital role in destroying h2o2 and in producing oh radicals at neutral ph owing to the increase of degraded tc 61 the results obtained regarding effects of ph on tc degradation are similar to those found by 42 61 64 3 3 effect of catalyst dose the effect of the variation of catalyst dose on the tc removal process was examined within the range of 0 005 to 0 01 g of catalyst particles per 1 l tc solution while the contact time from 0 to 180 min varied see fig 8 this figure reveals that with an increase in the feni3 sio2 dose from 0 005 to 0 01 g l the degradation rate of tc at equilibrium has increased from 50 21 to 69 43 respectively in addition the results showed the simultaneous effect of the increasing catalyst dose and reaction time the reason behind this behavior with the rise in the catalyst amount in the aqueous solution is to increase the surface area or reaction sites for pollutant reactions additionally degradation process of tc rapidly increased in the first 20 min as expected due to high tc concentration gradient at the beginning of the reaction it presents feni3 sio2 nanoparticles as an efficient catalyst to be applied for tc degradation subsequently as the reaction time increases from 30 to 120 min the degradation decreases for all doses of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles due to the continuous decrease in the concentration of non degraded tc molecules thus the percentage of degraded tc molecules increased slowly the above results agree with those obtained by 37 65 3 4 effect of initial concentration and kinetic study the tc degradation mechanism was tested as a function of initial tc concentration that varied from 10 to 30 mg l the other experimental factors such as ph and catalyst dose were optimized from previous tests at 7 and 0 01 g l respectively while a fixed concentration 150 mg l of h2o2 was also adopted the degradation curves see fig 9 demonstrats that the degradation efficiency of tc increases remarkably with the increase of reaction time from 0 to 180 min the equilibrium degradation efficiency also decreased from 87 26 to 52 10 with an increment in the initial concentration from 10 to 30 mg l respectively it can be explained based on the tc concentration which increased while the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles and h2o2 contents remained the same resulting in the production of same number of radicals 66 68 the experimental kinetic data of the tc degradation at different concentrations presented in fig 9 were modeled in accordance with the pseudo first order model eq 6 the rate constant k is determined by the linear plot of ln c t c o versus reaction time t as presented in fig 10 the results are listed in table 1 these results indicate that the pseudo first order model well suited all the kinetic data as the values obtained for the regression parameter r2 were 0 95 the determined k values at initial tc concentration of 10 and 30 mg l were 0 0081 and 0 0027 min 1 respectively such values reflected a high rate of heterogeneous catalytic fenton like reaction at lower concentrations 46 3 5 effect of h2o2 concentration as well documented the h2o2 is a powerful oxidizing agent in the fenton like catalytic process therefore the concentration of added h2o2 significantly depends on the type of pollutants intended to be degraded through this treatment method 69 fig 11 shows the curves corresponding to the variation of tc degradation as a function of h2o2 concentration from 50 to 200 mg l other experimental parameters that affect the tc degradation mechanism such as ph the concentration of the tc and feni3 sio2 catalyst dosage were all fixed in compliance with previous tests at the optimized values therefore the tc degradation efficiency at the equilibrium point increased from 54 1 to 73 11 an increase of h2o2 concentrations from 50 to 200 mg l the increase in the tc degradation efficiency together with that of h2o2 concentration are attributed to the production of more oxidizing agent oh which resulted in degradation of more tc molecules these results are in agreement with the results of other previous studies like safari et al 69 and soltani et al 70 it is worth mention that the surplus amount of h2o2 might consume oh leading to a decrease of degradation efficiency 3 6 reusability of catalysits study one of the most important parameters related to the uitilized catalyst activity and stability determins the value of its potential reusability 71 72 73 in the present study the reusability of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles catalyst was tested by measuring the efficiency of tc degradation in five cycles fig 12 after each cycle the nanoparticles catalyst was separated from the aqueous solution washed several times with distilled water and then dried in an oven at 90 c it is noted that the degradation efficiency decreased gradually from 87 first cycle to 77 fifth cycle due to mass loss of catalyst during washing and drying between each reusability cycle therefore the uitilized catalyst can be regenerated and re used in the tc degradation process for five times with minor losses of this antibiotic degradation efficiency 4 conclusion the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles as a heterogeneous catalyst were successfully synthesized and used in fenton like degradation process of tetracycline tc the investigation of degradation efficiency was carried out at different ph catalyst content initial tc and h2o2 concentrations the characterization using specific diagnostic techniques demonstrated that the synthesized nanoparticles have good catalytic properties like high surface area strong functional groups high pore size and nano size range of particles diameter the maximum percentage of tc degradation was obtained at ph solution close to neutral such a finding shows that feni3 sio2 nanoparticles are environment friendly catalysts for tc degradation in the wastewater treatment units furthermore the tc degradation efficiency reached to 87 at conditions such as ph 7 initial tc concentration 10 mg l feni3 sio2 nanoparticles content 0 1 g l and h2o2 concentration 150 mg l moreover the results indicated that the degradation rate might increase by increasing the catalyst dose and h2o2 concentration the pseudo first order kinetic model fitted the experimental data and had a statistically significant parameter thus the results obtained in the current investigation indicate that the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles catalyst in the heterogeneous fenton like reaction can be effectively used for the degradation of tc molecules in neutral ph medium with the reuse ability up to five cycles with minor depletion in the tc degradation efficiency therefore the present study suggests the utilizing of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles as an attractive efficient cost effective and eco friendly catalyst for the degradation of tc in the heterogeneous fenton like treatment process future studies can examine the effect of h2o2 at a concentration higher than 200 mg l and the role of each generated radical in efficiency degradation acknowledgments authors have expressed their gratitude to colleagues at the research laboratory faculty of health birjand university of

nanoparticles catalysts were successfully synthesized and employed in the heterogeneous fenton like treatment method for the efficient degradation of antibiotics i e tetracycline tc the characteristics of the synthesized catalyst were analyzed utilizing xrd sem tem bet and ft ir measurements which revealed that the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles possess several unique catalytically properties that make it a promising catalyst material the degradation mechanism was tested through varying the experimental factors ph 3 9 feni3 sio2 nanoparticles dose 0 005 0 1 g l reaction time 0 180 min initial tc concentration 10 30 mg l and concentration of degradation agent h2o2 50 200 mg l results revealed that tc degradation was in an escalated level at neutral ph and the degradation performance of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles for this antibiotic varied significantly with the variation of the catalyst dose and h2o2 concentration furthermore the kinetic data follow the pseudo first order model well with a maximum tc degradation efficiency of 87 achieved under optimized environmental conditions thus the present study reveals that feni3 sio2 magnetic nanoparticles are novel having promising application as an environment friendly catalyst for tc degradation in the neutral environment keywords fenton like nanoparticles catalyst tetracycline hydrogen peroxide environmental conditions 1 introduction nowadays population growth expanding industry ecotoxicity pollution from agriculture and wastewater treatment plants have become more important issues which can directly or indirectly affect our lifestyle in various ways regarding the last point lack of clean and accessible water in many areas around the world has increased the demand for developing new technologies to treat wastewater 1 3 antibiotics are a big part of drugs that are extensively used in the treatment of human and veterinary infections different studies have found that approximately 15 of the total drugs used are antibiotics 2 among types of antibiotics tetracycline tc falls in the second group which is produced and consumed by humans worldwide 4 it is one of the most widely used antibiotics as poultry medicine as well as in the treatment of human infection according to the previous studies the registered consumption of antibiotics worldwide was 100 to 200 thousand tons year 5 6 for example iran is among the top 20 countries as a consumer market of antibiotics 7 furthermore the annual consumption of tc compounds for livestock in the usa is expected to be around 3200 tons 8 additionally tc is generally used to treat several bacterial infections that widely spread in veterinary and agricultural fields a chronic bronchitis b brucella infections c chlamydia d mycoplasma acne and e legiruses 9 due to the wide range consumption of antibiotics studied labeled tc the routine compound 10 11 this antibiotic has four cyclic rings with an active carboxy amide group 8 12 although antibiotics are useful still some hazardous one in the aquatic environment can cause serious pollution 13 antibiotics are mainly introduced into aquatic environment via the disposal of bad quality wastewater effluents from pharmaceutical industries which are regarded the main source of antibiotic compounds in water bodies 14 more than that a significant amount of unused or residual drugs have been found in sewage and municipal wastewater treated effluent 15 the processes of chlorination or ozonation of wastewater loaded with pharmaceutical compounds may produce harmful by product chemicals which may be dangerous and carcinogenetic to humans 16 therefore eliminating these antibiotics from the sewage system before being discharged to aquatic environment has become essential 17 currently advanced oxidation gained intensive interest by researchers since this advanced treatment technology proved to be more efficient in the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds than other treatment processes 9 18 19 due to the production of high reactive radical compounds in the advanced oxidation treatment method the target pollutants are converted to low risk materials 20 21 the most tertiary wastewater treatment type of oxidation process is the fenton like oxidation process homogenous fenton like which proved to have a great potential for the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds 21 this method in principle uses ferric catalyst and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as a strong oxidant agent the product of hydroxide radical oh which results from a rapid decomposition reaction of h2o2 22 24 the oh radicals generated during the fenton like oxidation reactions have high degradation ability toward organic pollutants and can decompose them to water and carbon dioxide 25 26 throughout the past few years the integration of the fenton like treatment method together with other advanced treatment processes like the adsorption process were suggested by several scientific workers to be helpful in eradicating wastewater loaded with organic pollutants 27 however several drawbacks were highlighted that includes a production of too much sludge b leaving iron which reacts with hydrogen peroxide while undergoing conversion into ferric iron c using radicals produced in high concentrations d changing wastewater color after treatment and e the need for a permanent source of fe ii 26 28 29 therefore to solve these problems the heterogeneous fenton like technique was suggested as an alternative oxidation process for the homogeneous fenton like treatment method which assists in resolving problems related to ferric iron and sludge production 18 30 in contrast to the homogeneous fenton process the heterogeneous type process can be applied to either acidic or basic medium 31 32 among several materials which have been applied recently as a catalyst in this method such as feni3 nanoparticles mn3o4 clay zeolite coated with nanoparticles z scheme bi2fe4o9 bi2wo6 and carbon 25 33 35 feni3 nanosized particles are one of the most promising catalyst material to remediate contaminants therefore this type of catalysts attracted the attention of researchers because of simplicity in synthesis and operation effectiveness toward organic compounds within a wide range of operational conditions in addition to easily separate the magnetic nanoparticles using an external magnetic field 36 the proposed mechanism for heterogeneous fenton like oxidation process that employs feni3 nanoparticles as a catalyst can be described as follows 32 1 fe 3 h2o2 fe 3h2o2 2 fe 3h2o2 fe 3 ho2 h 3 fe 3 ho2 fe 2 o2 h 4 fe 2 h2o2 fe 3 oh oh to improve the catalytic activity of feni3 nanoparticles sio2 could be utilized to coat these nanoparticles thereby forming feni3 sio2 core shell 37 the coated sio2 particles act as a peroxidase like catalyst material that can accelerate the h2o2 decomposition into oh radicals thus improving the degradation rate of organic contaminants additionally sio2 can raise the degradation rate of pollutants since this material has a high number of active groups such as hydroxyl bonds 38 39 and nh bending vibration 40 that can enhance the adsorption of pollutants onto nanoparticles used as catalyst which will be degraded later 41 42 lu et al 2016 there are only a few studies that enriched the literature with regard to the application of feni3 sio2 magnetic nanoparticles as a catalyst to remove tc antibiotic from the contaminated wastewater therefore the present study aims to investigate the potential application of using feni3 sio2 magnetic nanoparticles as a catalyst to degrade the tc in advanced tertiary treatment unit i e heterogeneous fenton like process initially the characterization study was performed together with subsequent investigation of the effect of several environmental parameters ph initial tc concentration reaction time catalyst dose and h2o2 concentration on the tc degradation mechanism in addition a detailed study was conducted to describe the kinetic mechanism of the degradation process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals in the current study highly pure and laboratory grade chemicals were used as received from the manufacturer fecl2 4h2o nicl2 6h2o n2h4 h2o sic8h20o4 and ho c2h4o nh were procured from merck while the powder of tc chemical formula c22h24o8n2 hcl molecular weight 480 9 g mol solubility 0 041 mol l and purity 95 was procured from sigma aldrich moreover preparation and dilution of the tc stock 1000 mg l and all other working solutions used throughout the steps of experiments was carried out using deionized water in order to prevent loss in the stability of the antibiotics and to keep the antibiotic safe the solutions prepared were stored in a dark place at a temperature 4 c to be used in experiments for a maximal period of 10 days in order to control the ph value during the experimental time hcl and naoh of 1 n were used fig 1 depicts the chemical structure of tc molecule 2 2 synthesis of catalyst the synthesis process of feni3 sio2 magnetic nanoparticles was conducted in two stages according to the following methodology 43 44 polyethylene glycol surfactant of quantity 1 0 g was mixed with 180 ml of deionized water at constant stirring till completely dissolved similarly another two solutions were separately prepared from the dissolving of 0 713 g nicl2 6h2o and 0 188 g fecl2 4h2o in 10 ml of deionized water these two solutions were simultaneously added to the earlier prepared polyethylene glycol solution the resultant mixture was stirred with naoh 80 concentration until ph of solution reaches between 12 and 13 afterward 1 9 ml of hydrazine hydrate n2h4 h2o was added to this suspension with vigorous stirring at room temperature for 24 h the separation of the solid nanoparticles of feni3 from the solution was carried out using magnet followed by thorough washing with deionized water until the ph becomes close to neutral value and was subsequently dried at 80 c for 8 h at this stage the feni3 nanoparticles were obtained according to the procedure suggested by yang et al 37 lu et al 43 and and in order to shell feni3 nanoparticles with sio2 the following experimental steps were taken first about 0 5 g of prepared feni3 particles was dispersed in a solution containing 2 0 ml of ammonia 28 80 ml of ethanol 99 7 and 20 ml of deionized water in the second step 1 0 ml of tetraethyl ortho silicate solution was added to the above solution drop wise the resultant mixture was shaken at 500 rpm at room temperature for 24 h using an incubator shaker it is worth mentioning that tetraethyl ortho silicate was hydrolyzed in alcohol methanol or ethanol in the presence of ammonia as a catalyst thus the resulting feni3 sio2 magnetic nanoparticles obtained were washed for several times with ethanol and then with deionized water in order to remove any impurities then separated by a magnetic source and finally dried at 60 c till the content is completely dried 2 3 characterization of the catalyst both feni3 and feni3 sio2 nanoparticles were characterized using various devices the surfaces morphology was examined using transmission electron microscopy tem and field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem high resolution images captured via a scanner zeiss em10c 100 kv germany furthermore analyzing the functional groups fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra was investigated using avatar spectroscopy instrument usa magnetism property of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles was analyzed using a vsm model 7400 vsm while brunauer emmett teller bet analysis was used to estimate the pore volume value and the specific surface area of the prepared nanoparticles using belsorp mini ii high precision analyzer additionally to identify the crystalline structure of the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the synthesized catalyst were obtained using x ray diffractometer xpert pro panalytical co netherland with high power cuk α radiation maintained at the scan rate of 2 degrees minute 2 4 the experiments of tc degradation in the present study all the degradation experiments of tc in the heterogeneous fenton like reactor were conducted in a batch equilibrium system using several glass flasks of 500 ml with controlling the following conditions 200 ml of tc solution ambient temperature of 20 1 c agitation speed of 500 rpm the tc degradation was examined by varying ph 3 9 initial tc concentration 10 30 mg l reaction time up to 180 min amount of feni3 sio2 magnetic nanoparticles in the tc solution 0 005 0 1 g l and h2o2 concentration 50 200 mg l at a specific reaction or equilibrium time suspensions each of 2 ml were withdrawn carefully from each flask and centrifuged then the separated solutions were tested for the remaining tc concentration the initial and residual non degraded tc concentration in the tested samples were analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometer model t80 pg instrument ltd uk at a wavelength of 358 nm the degradation data obtained from the study of effect of initial tc concentration on its degradation process were used to fit of the kinetic model notably all the results of degradation tests were listed as averaged values of triplicate analysis the degradation percentage r of tc can be determined using eq 5 where c 0 and c e are the initial and non degraded tc concentrations mg l respectively in the supernatant after centrifuging 5 r c 0 c e c 0 100 2 5 kinetic model generally a kinetic study of reaction rate of organic pollutants is essential for the degradation treatment method such as fenton like process and also important to investigate the performance of the used catalytic in the purification treatment system 45 furthermore the study of mathematical modeling of the experimental kinetics data using familiar kinetic models is important for accurately design of the treatment system within this context the most popular kinetic model used for modeling the degradation data of organic materials is the pseudo first order 46 47 which is illustrated in its linear form in eq 6 below it is worth mentioning that the accuracy of suitability between the applied kinetic models and the experimental data is being evaluated according to the result values of the regression coefficient r2 the half life time t 1 2 of tc degradation corresponding to c t c 0 0 5 is calculated using the eq 7 41 6 ln c t c 0 k t 7 t 1 2 0 693 k where k is the rate constant min 1 and c t denotes to the measured tc concentration mg l at specific reaction or degradation time t min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of catalyst results of the bet analysis fig 2 revealed that the specific surface area and the total pore volume of the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles were 481 58 m2 g and 0 2 cm3 g respectively such results indicate good catalytical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles due to the fact that particles of large surface areas provide plentiful active sites thus improving oxidation rate of pollutant molecules into the used catalyst 48 36 according to the results obtained via n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles sample fig 2a the used catalyst is a mesoporous structure material which can be specified as classical type iv 49 in addition the steep jump loop observed at a relative pressure p p0 range 0 89 0 99 refers to inter crystalline voids of the synthesized nanoparticles 50 fig 2b represents the barrett joyner and halenda bjh plot for the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles sample which implies that the pore radius is probably around 12 nm the results obtained from magnetization analysis see fig 3 demonstrated that the feni3 sio2 nanoparticle has super paramagnetic properties as its saturation magnetization equaled to 69 69 electrostatic unit g moreover this property facilitates the separation of the feni3 sio2 nanoparticle in the presence of an external magnetic source fig 4 shows the xrd patterns of feni3 and feni3 sio2 nanoparticles generally these patterns are help to identify the approximate crystalline size and structure of the used solid materials based on the scherrer equation eq 8 the average crystallite size l of feni3 and feni3 sio2 particles was 10 and 45 nm respectively 51 the crystalline structure at 2θ 75 5 51 7 and 44 5 represent the structure of feni3 the longitudinal axis of 2θ 25 10 corresponds to amorphous silica that appeared due to the existence of the si layer in the synthesized feni3 sio2 nanoparticles catalyst 52 from another side it could be clearly noticed that there was no significant shift of typical diffraction peaks of feni3 and feni3 sio2 nanoparticles indicating that no detectable damage or change in the chemical structure of the feni3 after being coated with sio2 particles 8 l k λ β cos θ where k is the crystallite shape constant which ranges between 0 62 2 08 normally taken as 0 89 λ nm is xrd radiation wavelength β radians refers to the half maximal peak width located at any 2θ radians in the xrd pattern the ft ir analysis of feni3 and feni3 sio2 nanoparticles can be visualized in fig 5 the ft ir peaks at 447 44 cm 1 in feni3 and 804 54 669 69 and 479 82 cm 1 in feni3 sio2 are correspond to the tensile vibrations of metal pillars of fe ni ni fe ni or fe ni ni groups 52 the two strong bands found in the ft ir spectra of feni3 sio2 at 1124 05 and 972 05 cm 1 denote the existence of si o si of silica group or specify the formation si o ni formation and si o fe functional groups resulting from si bonding with the fe and ni metal nanoparticles during successful synthesis of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles 53 the weak absorption band detected in the feni3 ft ir spectrum at 3348 99 and feni3 sio2 at 3382 97 cm 1 belongs to the negatively charged hydroxyl oh active group 52 54 notably oh group belongs to physisorbed water molecules in the pores of sio2 38 55 the apparent grain and internal structures of the feni3 sio2 were investigated by taking fe sem and tem images at a scale bar of 200 and 100 nm respectively see fig 6 the fe sem image reveals that the surface of feni3 sio2 is an irregularly shaped agglomerated nanoparticles while most of them are spherical the size of these particles is within the range of nanoscale which in turn indicates that the synthesis of nanoparticles has a strong tendency to undergo agglomeration due to their high magnetic property as presented in fig 3 moreover several morphology features of feni3 sio2 apperead like the coarse surface of this catalyst and contains a lot of grooves the visualization of small pores was also feasible thus these significant features facilitate tc degradation onto the external and internal pore reaction sites on the surface of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles since these characteristics increase the surface area of the catalyst for contaminant reaction according to the high resolution tem micrograph the nanoparticles of feni3 sio2 have a size of 40 70 nm 3 2 effect of ph in the fenton like process applications the removal efficiency must be examined at different values of solution ph since this parameter can influence the degradation process of pollutants in several ways because oh has a relatively lower redox potential in basic medium h2o2 may be consumed without production of oh 56 57 in addition the dissolution property of the antibiotic molecules and surface charge of the utilized catalyst can also influence the degradation process in this current direction the analysis of the ph of point zero charge phpzc determination reveals that the phpzc of feni3 sio2 is close to 7 5 fig 7 a thus the surfaces of the prepared catalyst above this value will be saturated with negative charges coming from surplus oh ions moreover the dominant feni3 sio2 functional groups of negative charges may get protonated by h protons at solution ph phpzc fig 7b shows the variation of tc degradation efficiency as a function of solution ph the results showed that the highest removal efficiency 53 72 was at neutral ph hence it is an attractive property that makes feni3 sio2 a favorable and eco friendly catalyst for the removal of tc in the advanced oxidation units since almost all surface water resources and wastewater approximately have neutral ph 50 58 this phenomenon can be related to the nature of sio2 that covers feni3 nanoparticle 41 59 at ph phpzc the oh ions are combined with the fe 3 to produce iron hydroxide deposits thereby reducing the availability of active groups of the catalyst significantly thus the reaction of tc molecules onto the surface of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles may be inhibited leading to a decrease in the number of degraded tc molecules literature reported that tc molecule was an amphoteric organic chemical containing three functional groups two acidic which are tricarbonyl amide and phenolic diketone groups and one basic represented by dimethyl amine group 60 according to solution ph various tc species will be predominated see fig 1 at ph 3 30 pka1 tc molecules may mainly present as fully protonated h4tc while at 3 30 ph 7 68 pka2 the majority of tc molecules are presented as neutral h3tc0 species in addition at 7 68 ph 9 70 pka3 this antibiotic exists as h2tc and at ph 9 70 the tc 2 will be the predominating species of tc molecules 41 noticeably the activity of h2o2 and radical species is enhanced in case of existence of tc and tc2 higher than tc 60 it should also be emphasized that the concentration of h protons increases with the decrease of ph thus leading to in competition between the protons and the tc molecules for the negatively charged sites of the catalyst furthermore at low ph value the increase in the h concentration leads to the formation of oh2 species which makes the catalyst surface positive and that leads to the repulsion of the tc molecules via electrostatic forces in the fenton like treatment process studying the effect of solution ph is essential for a investigating the removal efficiency of the target contaminant b understanding the chemical reaction that occurs during the oxidation process in this context one should note the relatively high solubility of h2o2 during oxidation processes at neutral ph therefore the fe 3 in the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles plays a vital role in destroying h2o2 and in producing oh radicals at neutral ph owing to the increase of degraded tc 61 the results obtained regarding effects of ph on tc degradation are similar to those found by 42 61 64 3 3 effect of catalyst dose the effect of the variation of catalyst dose on the tc removal process was examined within the range of 0 005 to 0 01 g of catalyst particles per 1 l tc solution while the contact time from 0 to 180 min varied see fig 8 this figure reveals that with an increase in the feni3 sio2 dose from 0 005 to 0 01 g l the degradation rate of tc at equilibrium has increased from 50 21 to 69 43 respectively in addition the results showed the simultaneous effect of the increasing catalyst dose and reaction time the reason behind this behavior with the rise in the catalyst amount in the aqueous solution is to increase the surface area or reaction sites for pollutant reactions additionally degradation process of tc rapidly increased in the first 20 min as expected due to high tc concentration gradient at the beginning of the reaction it presents feni3 sio2 nanoparticles as an efficient catalyst to be applied for tc degradation subsequently as the reaction time increases from 30 to 120 min the degradation decreases for all doses of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles due to the continuous decrease in the concentration of non degraded tc molecules thus the percentage of degraded tc molecules increased slowly the above results agree with those obtained by 37 65 3 4 effect of initial concentration and kinetic study the tc degradation mechanism was tested as a function of initial tc concentration that varied from 10 to 30 mg l the other experimental factors such as ph and catalyst dose were optimized from previous tests at 7 and 0 01 g l respectively while a fixed concentration 150 mg l of h2o2 was also adopted the degradation curves see fig 9 demonstrats that the degradation efficiency of tc increases remarkably with the increase of reaction time from 0 to 180 min the equilibrium degradation efficiency also decreased from 87 26 to 52 10 with an increment in the initial concentration from 10 to 30 mg l respectively it can be explained based on the tc concentration which increased while the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles and h2o2 contents remained the same resulting in the production of same number of radicals 66 68 the experimental kinetic data of the tc degradation at different concentrations presented in fig 9 were modeled in accordance with the pseudo first order model eq 6 the rate constant k is determined by the linear plot of ln c t c o versus reaction time t as presented in fig 10 the results are listed in table 1 these results indicate that the pseudo first order model well suited all the kinetic data as the values obtained for the regression parameter r2 were 0 95 the determined k values at initial tc concentration of 10 and 30 mg l were 0 0081 and 0 0027 min 1 respectively such values reflected a high rate of heterogeneous catalytic fenton like reaction at lower concentrations 46 3 5 effect of h2o2 concentration as well documented the h2o2 is a powerful oxidizing agent in the fenton like catalytic process therefore the concentration of added h2o2 significantly depends on the type of pollutants intended to be degraded through this treatment method 69 fig 11 shows the curves corresponding to the variation of tc degradation as a function of h2o2 concentration from 50 to 200 mg l other experimental parameters that affect the tc degradation mechanism such as ph the concentration of the tc and feni3 sio2 catalyst dosage were all fixed in compliance with previous tests at the optimized values therefore the tc degradation efficiency at the equilibrium point increased from 54 1 to 73 11 an increase of h2o2 concentrations from 50 to 200 mg l the increase in the tc degradation efficiency together with that of h2o2 concentration are attributed to the production of more oxidizing agent oh which resulted in degradation of more tc molecules these results are in agreement with the results of other previous studies like safari et al 69 and soltani et al 70 it is worth mention that the surplus amount of h2o2 might consume oh leading to a decrease of degradation efficiency 3 6 reusability of catalysits study one of the most important parameters related to the uitilized catalyst activity and stability determins the value of its potential reusability 71 72 73 in the present study the reusability of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles catalyst was tested by measuring the efficiency of tc degradation in five cycles fig 12 after each cycle the nanoparticles catalyst was separated from the aqueous solution washed several times with distilled water and then dried in an oven at 90 c it is noted that the degradation efficiency decreased gradually from 87 first cycle to 77 fifth cycle due to mass loss of catalyst during washing and drying between each reusability cycle therefore the uitilized catalyst can be regenerated and re used in the tc degradation process for five times with minor losses of this antibiotic degradation efficiency 4 conclusion the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles as a heterogeneous catalyst were successfully synthesized and used in fenton like degradation process of tetracycline tc the investigation of degradation efficiency was carried out at different ph catalyst content initial tc and h2o2 concentrations the characterization using specific diagnostic techniques demonstrated that the synthesized nanoparticles have good catalytic properties like high surface area strong functional groups high pore size and nano size range of particles diameter the maximum percentage of tc degradation was obtained at ph solution close to neutral such a finding shows that feni3 sio2 nanoparticles are environment friendly catalysts for tc degradation in the wastewater treatment units furthermore the tc degradation efficiency reached to 87 at conditions such as ph 7 initial tc concentration 10 mg l feni3 sio2 nanoparticles content 0 1 g l and h2o2 concentration 150 mg l moreover the results indicated that the degradation rate might increase by increasing the catalyst dose and h2o2 concentration the pseudo first order kinetic model fitted the experimental data and had a statistically significant parameter thus the results obtained in the current investigation indicate that the feni3 sio2 nanoparticles catalyst in the heterogeneous fenton like reaction can be effectively used for the degradation of tc molecules in neutral ph medium with the reuse ability up to five cycles with minor depletion in the tc degradation efficiency therefore the present study suggests the utilizing of feni3 sio2 nanoparticles as an attractive efficient cost effective and eco friendly catalyst for the degradation of tc in the heterogeneous fenton like treatment process future studies can examine the effect of h2o2 at a concentration higher than 200 mg l and the role of each generated radical in efficiency degradation acknowledgments authors have expressed their gratitude to colleagues at the research laboratory faculty of health birjand university of

14253,the work detailed here investigated the efficiency of fenton like processes in degrading endocrine disrupting chemicals as exemplified by di n butyl phthalate dbp specifically a heterogeneous fenton process was applied as catalyzed by natural or modified bottom sediments collected from rzeszów and solina reservoirs poland a number of sediments with different physicochemical properties and different contents of fe mn and cu were in fact obtained and used with modification entailing ion exchange reaction and impregnation it thus proved possible to demonstrate the possibility and legitimacy of fenton s reagent being modified by natural bottom sediments that may therefore be regarded as heterogeneous catalysts given a status as endogenous sources of iron manganese and copper ions while the effectiveness of dbp degradation was indeed influenced by sediment type and composition and modification thereof it was also affected by the factors of time ph dbp concentration sediment dose and h2o2 the use of natural bottom sediments in the role of solid catalysts in heterogeneous fenton processes represents a promising alternative to environmental remediation technology given their abundance low cost and environment friendly nature keywords bottom sediment endogenous catalysts heterogeneous fenton processes di n butyl phthalate green environmental remediation technology 1 introduction in recent years increasing attention has been paid to heterogeneous fenton like reactions while the classic fenton process sees soluble iron ii ions deployed in an acidic environment in such a way that oxidation takes place with part of the catalyst remaining in the treated wastewater and part precipitating out as fe oh 3 that then constitutes additional sediment heterogeneous catalysis sees the place of the soluble catalyst taken by a solid alternative that can be recovered and re used with only small amounts of fe passing through to the wastewater a further benefit of the heterogeneous catalyst is the way it extends the ph range across which the fenton reaction remains effective however as a heterogeneous catalyst is selected account needs to be taken of such characteristics as the content and degree of leaching of the ions present in the material as well as abrasion resistance ease of particle sedimentation to achieve separation from wastewater chemical stability and capacity for rapid regeneration and catalytic activity in the fenton reaction 1 8 in these contexts catalysts used in versions of the fenton reaction can either be classed as natural in the form of minerals soils or clays synthetic or obtained by means of modification of various materials fe0 or industrial waste catalysts in the first group have in fact proved to be excellent alternatives given their low cost high level of availability and catalytic activity and long term stability examples have included metal oxides and iron containing zeolites with particular success demonstrated in the cases of goethite pyrite hematite broadleaf and magnetite the most important zeolites making up deposits include clinoptilolite filipse chabasite and mordenite 9 11 silva et al 12 purified soil contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons using a fenton reaction whose only iron was that occurring naturally in the soils studied where the easily extractable iron content in soils 1 and 2 respectively were of 9 1 and 0 6 g kg in both cases a high 90 degree of removal of impurities was obtained where process parameters were optimal these studies confirmed the possibility of natural materials being used in the fenton process even with no modification necessary nevertheless a desire to improve on physicochemical properties and increase catalytic activity has encouraged effort to modify natural materials or engage in the synthesis of new ones of specific composition zeolites can be variously modified e g by co precipitation ion exchange impregnation and or encapsulation 3 4 further heterogeneous fenton process catalysts that have been made use of include ion exchange resins immobilised with fe iii ions 13 raschig glass rings 14 active alumina coated with an fe2o3 layer 15 granulated activated carbon impregnated with iron 16 17 and zeolites with fe iii ions or other transition metal ions immobilised on their surface 18 the composites and artificially produced modified materials studied in turn include fe2 ac α fe2o3 s cuo al feooh c iron iii on algae fibers iron oxide sio2 and magnetite based catalysts 19 described in this paper is a preliminary study on the use of natural and modified bottom sediments as heterogeneous catalysts in a fenton like process seeking to achieve effective degradation of dbp a known endocrine disrupting compound the basis for this approach lay in the status of bottom sediments as natural sources of iron manganese and copper and in the assumption that ions of these metals might be released sufficiently to ensure reactions with hydrogen peroxide mirroring those involving the classical fenton reagent di n butyl phthalate is the most frequently occurring pollutant in the natural environment and because it is soluble in water and stable in environmental conditions it is often detected in aquatic ecosystems landfill leachates and wastewater and even in drinking water typically the amounts of dbp in surface waters are in the range of 0 013 to 122 μg l there is often confirmation in the literature of much higher phthalates in surface waters e g the concentration of dehp in germany was recorded at 2700 μg l in italy 4600 μg l in landfill leachates there are much larger amounts of this compound up to 18 mg l on the other hand poor solubility of phthalates in water results in adsorption on suspended solid particles and accumulation in bottom sediments from 0 5 to 30 mg kg dry weight 20 22 due to the common occurrence of di n butyl phthalate in the aquatic environment and its negative impact on the environment and living organisms research has been undertaken to remove this compound from aqueous solutions 2 experimental section 2 1 bottom sediments collection and preliminary preparation samples of bottom sediment were collected once from rzeszów and solina reservoirs these sites differ in that the first of the bodies of water is under strong anthropopressure associated with local agriculture that causes severe land erosion with the result that bot the depositing of rubble and diffuse pollution take place 23 sampling made use of a gravity sediment corer kc kajak and samples obtained were pre cleaned and dried to an air dry state the bottom sediments were then ground in a mortar sieved through a 1 mm sieve and dried to constant mass at 105 c sediment ph content of organic matter and caco3 and content of fe mn and cu were then all determined prior to investigation of how substances leached from the sediment into aqueous solution 2 2 methodology of modification of bottom sediments ion exchange and impregnation methods were applied to enrich natural bottom sediments further with fe mn cu i e to obtain heterogeneous catalysts containing various amounts of catalytically active substances the for this purpose 500 ml of aqueous solutions containing specific concentrations of fe mn cu ions prepared by dissolving salts of these metals in distilled water 50 g portions of dried sediment were then added to the solutions and stirred on magnetic stirrers for 12 h the suspension obtained was then filtered before precipitates with repeat washed with distilled water and then dried to constant mass at 105 c for 12 h to obtain portions of the catalyst ready for use the impregnation method in turn involved mixing sediment with salt solution until the water had evaporated completely with further procedure then resembling that with ion exchange contents of fe mn and cu in the catalysts obtained were determined as was the degree of leaching of metals and other components into an aqueous medium 2 3 physicochemical analyses of sediments and catalysts to determine the ph of bottom sediments 2 g of air dried samples were weighed into centrifuge tubes and 25 ml of distilled water or 1 m kcl solution added prior to shaking for 5 min on a shaker suspensions were then left for 2 h and centrifuged before ph values were measured by immersing an electrode in the supernatant the content of organic matter was determined directly in terms of mass loss from sludge following roasting at high temperature for this purpose weighed 2 g portions of pre prepared bottom sediments were placed in crucibles transferred to a muffle furnace and roasted for 4 h at 550 c roasted samples were then cooled in an exicator and weighed on an analytical balance the percentage of organic matter om was calculated from the difference in mass between samples before and after ignition fe mn and cu concentrations in collected bottom sediments and obtained catalysts were determined following mineralisation of the samples the latter process used microwave energy in a multi station mars 6 mineraliser for this purpose 0 5 g portions of sediment were weighed out before being transferred to teflon vessels x press to which 10 ml of concentrated hno3 were added prior to being placed in the mineraliser sediment samples were left for two hours at room temperature to ensure that material was pre dissolved after cooling the solutions were filtered through a soft filter paper into volumetric flasks and diluted with distilled water to a volume of 50 ml the resulting solutions were then filtered through a 0 2 μm syringe filter prior to determinations for concentrations of metals being carried out using an icp oes spectrometer the leachability of substances metals and ions from the examined bottom sediments was investigated using pn z 15009 24 this entailed 1 g of sediment being placed in a conical flask along with 10 ml of distilled water to obtain the required solution ph values i e 3 or 7 h2so4 or naoh were dosed into the solutions the flask was then sealed with a stopper and shaken for 60 min determinations for the metals were then carried out by filtering the contents of the first flask into a 50 ml flask with 10 ml of hno3 added to the solution and the distillate made up to the mark with distilled water in aqueous extracts obtained in this wat determinations of metal concentrations were again made using an icp oes spectrometer to determine concentrations of selected ions in the extracts a leaching test similar to that for the metals was carried out determinations of inorganic anions and cations cl mg2 ca2 k na eluted from precipitates into solution were made using an ics 5000 ion chromatograph from dionex analysis was preceded by filtering of solutions through a 0 2 μm syringe filter and a membrane filter the caco3 content was determined by scheibler s method 2 4 removal of dbp from water using a modified fenton process the setup for the removal of dbp using fenton type processes consisted of a 4 position mixer and reactors beakers of capacity 50 500 ml these were filled periodically with a 5 mg l dbp solution with ph correction using a solution of h2so4 or naoh the heterogeneous fenton process used natural or modified bottom sediments with appropriate amounts of catalyst introduced into the dbp solution and the whole stirred for 0 5 h further ph correction followed with the h2o2 solution then introduced after an appropriate reaction time reaction solutions were neutralised to ph 8 9 using sodium hydroxide 20 ml of solution samples were then taken and the residual concentration of dbp assessed the effectiveness of this modified fenton process in degrading dbp in model aqueous solutions was investigated more thoroughly in relation to hydrogen peroxide dose catalyst dose initial solution ph value and concentration of the studied chemical compound and reaction time also analysed were change in reaction solution parameters and the leaching of selected chemical compounds from the applied sediments and catalysts into the reaction mixture 2 5 determination of dbp using gas chromatography dbp isolation involved solid phase extraction and determination using a gas chromatograph spe extraction procedure were as reported above 25 analysis of the dbp was performed using a gcms system coupling trace gc ultra with triplus to an itq 1100 thermo scientific dbp elimination in the processes studied was evaluated by reference to changes in concentration quantification of dbp was performed using internal calibration benzyl benzoate served as the internal standard by which dbp was quantified the linearity of the calibration curve has been tested over a range of dbp concentrations from 0 to 7 5 mg l with data obtained showing that across this range detector readings as a function of dbp concentrations remain linear r2 coefficient 0 99 average levels of dbp recovery from distilled water are in the 97 109 the limit of quantification loq was found at 53 μg l and the limit of detection lod at 20 μg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 use of natural bottom sediments detailed study on the catalytic activity of bottom sediments in degrading dbp was preceded by preliminary experiments inter alia seeking to exclude sorption of the test substance on sediments and reaction vessels as table 1 shows these were carried out on systems of differing composition processes were carried out for 240 min with sampling for analysis every 60 min the results obtained at this stage are shown in fig 1 our work precluded the sorption of dbp on either glass or sediments as well as showing that hydrogen peroxide alone could not remove the test compound completely given an oxidation reaction yield not exceeding 30 in contrast the result of using hydrogen peroxide in the presence of bottom sediments extracted from rzeszów reservoir was a significant increase in dbp degradation efficiency a 71 yield after 4 h of the process the classic four phase procedure for using a fenton reagent entails acidification of the reaction medium catalyst dosage dosage of hydrogen peroxide and final neutralisation however the use of bottom sediments following prior acidification of the reaction environment is found to increase ph value and hence reduce dbp removal efficiency significantly our studies thus had sediments dosed first with the solution only being acidified 30 min later with h2o2 then dosed during the processes it was also observed that the ph value of the solution changed which systematically increased and after about 2 h of the fenton process the reaction mixture was slightly acidic and after 4 h in some cases close to neutral this is an important advantage in terms of technology since after the process it is no longer necessary to neutralize the reaction solution in order to determine the possible cause of the ph value change an analysis of selected reaction solutions for the concentration of selected ions was carried out most likely the change in ph is the result of alkaline compounds leaching e g calcium and magnesium compounds from the bottom sediments catalysts into the reaction medium the effectiveness of fenton process dbp degradation was then considered in relation to the bottom sediments used from either rzeszów reservoir or solina reservoir as differences between removal efficiency after 120 and 180 min of the fenton heterogeneous process were found to be non significant sampling after 180 min was discontinued and the reaction time extended to 420 min the results obtained at this stage are as shown in fig 2 collected data show that type of sediment had an impact on the effectiveness of the fenton process with fuller degradation of dbp obtained with sediments originating from solina 60 min into the reaction the 60 yield was twice as high as that obtained using sediments from rzeszów reservoir in turn after 240 min complete degradation of dbp has been achieved where the process used solina sediments while even after 7 h the maximum rate of removal in the process using rzeszów sediments was 83 such differences presumably relate to physicochemical properties of sediments as detailed in table 2 while rzeszów reservoir sediments are slightly alkaline ph 7 88 7 95 those from solina are near neutral ph 6 54 6 67 however the main differences between the two lies in the om content as well as those of calcium carbonate and different metals specifically the rzeszów sediments contain twice as much organic matter ten times as much caco3 and levels of iron copper and manganese of 16 884 45 32 and 457 8 mg kg dm respectively 22 332 27 42 and 335 9 mg kg dm in solina sediments all the parameters described are capable of exerting a significant impact on the process by which dbp is degraded first a higher content of organic compounds requires higher doses of reagents and secondly the presence of both organic and inorganic contaminants e g carbonates scavenges hydroxyl radicals responsible for oxidation the strong effect of radical scavenging of oh by hco3 and co3 2 is shown in eqs 1 1 and 1 2 it is also worth mentioning the higher iron content in the solina sediments which could also account for more complete degradation of the tested pollutant 1 1 oh hco3 co3 h2o 1 2 oh co3 co3 oh 3 2 use of modified bottom sediments the stage of the research involving modification of the naturally occurring rzeszów reservoir sediment catalyst 1 revolved around the iron manganese and copper contents eight catalysts numbers 2 9 were obtained via ion exchange a further 2 numbers 10 and 11 by impregnation the catalysts are presented in terms of their physico chemical properties in table 3 thus the fe1 catalyst was obtained by adding fe2 salt during modification so that the proportion of added iron ions reached 1 in relation to the weight of the modified sediments an analogous situation applied to the fe5 catalyst fe2 contribution 5 in turn to obtain the femncu1 catalyst salts of iron copper and manganese were used the proportion of each being 1 in relation to the entire sediment sample the fe5 i and femncu5 i catalysts were obtained by way of impregnation given that this method entails the filling of pores in the carrier with a solution of a metal salt at the correct concentration for specific surface coverage in contrast the essence of ion exchange is the exchange of ions between the support sediments and the ions present in the surrounding solution the limitation of the ion exchange method is the possibility of obtaining catalysts of low metal content only 26 fenton reaction effectiveness was then compared between sediments modified using the ion exchange method and natural bottom sediments dredged from rzeszów reservoir three replicates were run in the testing of each catalyst the results are as presented in fig 3 in the form of the arithmetic mean for these replicates the error bars are not shown due to the obscuration of the drawing the process was seen to be associated with a ph change in solutions in the sense of a steady increasing such that after 2 h of the fenton process the reaction mixture is only slightly acidic while after 4 h it is close to neutral in some cases this is an important advantage from the technological point of view as no longer necessitates neutralisation of the post reaction solution to determine the possible cause of ph change post reaction solutions were analysed for concentrations of different ions see table 4 it was found to be most likely that the change in reaction reflected a leaching of alkaline for example calcium and magnesium compounds from sediments into the reaction medium evaluation of the impact of basic parameters on the efficiency of dbp removal via the heterogeneous fenton process was then possible the effect of ph on effectiveness was tested for first by reference to 2 exemplary catalysts differing markedly in metal content i e femncu5 sediments versus natural bottom sediments from rzeszów reservoir fenton processes were then run in solutions of ph 3 5 or 7 the results are presented in fig 4 ph was found to have a clear effect on the course of the reaction with the course of the process best favoured by acidic environment whether sediments are natural or modified femncu5 a higher yield of the reaction in an acidic environment reflects intensified leaching of metals from sediments to the medium as compared to in a neutral solution to confirm the effect of ph water extracts were prepared with the elution liquid being deionised water at either ph 3 or ph 7 table 5 presents the results of the fe mn and cu leaching tests for 1 g portions of sediment with the weight ratio of sediment to water being 1 10 the results confirm much greater leaching in an acidic environment hence easier access to the ions of these metals and a more effective fenton reaction three catalysts differentiated in terms of iron content were then selected and compared these were natural sediment from rzeszów reservoir or else sediment modified into fe1 and fe5 catalysts these sediments were characterised by respective levels of iron equal to 16 884 20 648 and 32 664 mg kg dm results concerning the influence of iron content in sediments on the effectiveness of dbp removal from water are as shown in fig 5 an undisputed assumption regarding the fenton reaction is that the higher the iron content the greater the efficiency of removal of organic impurities this dependence reflects the leaching of iron from the catalysts into the acidic solution a straightforward relationship between a higher iron content in sediments and higher concentration in aqueous extract is demonstrable differences in the efficiency of removal of dbp were most evident in the first 2 h of reaction when the solution was still acidic with a ph around 3 in the following hours the differences in dbp oxidation efficiency in the processes used were negligible due to the increase in ph noted in all reaction solutions it was the effect on dbp removal of increasing the dose of hydrogen peroxide that was checked subsequently with the h2o2 concentration tested over a 2 fold range from 100 to 200 mmol l the results are as shown in fig 6 increasing the dose of oxidant increased dbp degradation slightly where natural sediments were used while impairing the removal process by 20 in the presence of the femncu5 catalyst as the natural bottom sediments have lower contents of the transition metals fe mn and cu an increased dose of h2o2 allowed for the formation of more of the hydroxyl radicals responsible for degrading dbp while an increased dose of h2o2 up to a certain threshold is known to increase the rate of degradation of organic contaminants via strengthened hydroxyl radical formation a further increase in h2o2 beyond the threshold reduces reaction rate this effect was to be observed in the process involving femncu5 and is explicable in terms of radical scavenging by excess h2o2 with numbers of hydroxyl radicals in solution actually reduced in this way 27 at higher h2o2 concentrations the formation of radicals is followed by their exhaustion thanks to a hydrogen peroxide scavenging mechanism that gives rise to hydroperoxyl radicals characterised by lower oxidation strength reaction 1 3 with these radicals also able to trap hydroxyl in line with eq 1 4 28 1 3 h2o2 oh h2o hoo 1 4 hoo oh h2o o2 the effect of the dose of bottom sediment as catalyst on the efficiency of oxidation of dbp in water was then checked for with results as presented in fig 7 in the form of an average from the results obtained the dose of bottom sediment was varied across the 2 5 10 g l range while remaining operating parameters were left unchanged on the one hand the degree of dbp degradation was greater where the sediment dose was 5 as opposed to 2 5 g l on the other hand a quantity of sediment as great as 10 g l was associated with lower removal efficiency a phenomenon that may reflect an increase in the amount of metal ions involved in the process with a resultant significant increase in the number of oh radicals followed by their recombination with an increased capture effect 29 similar conclusions were drawn in research carried out by other scientists for example idrissi et al 28 used a clay modified by impregnation with iron ions in a fenton process removing dye from water a 75 mg dose of catalyst as compared with 25 mg was associated with a greater yield whereas a quantity of catalyst equal to 100 mg was again associated with a lower rate of degradation of the test substance another example confirming that too high a dose of heterogeneous catalyst is not always associated with better reaction efficiency came with studies on the removal of dye methyl orange in a fenton process using clay modified with copper ions a dose of over 40 mg was not merely associated with no higher level of pollutant degradation but was actually linked with a lower level of effectiveness the effect of initial dbp concentration on the course of a heterogeneous fenton process was also investigated because the concentration of impurities is an important parameter in wastewater treatment the results are shown in fig 8 as fig 8 shows a higher dbp concentration was associated with a level of degradation efficiency in relation to sediments from rzeszów reservoir that was lower by about 8 however in the case of the process using the femncu catalyst the efficiency was higher by about 15 one conclusion would hold that the lower the initial dbp concentration the shorter the reaction time needed to achieve complete degradation similar results were obtained by xu et al 30 in studies into the removal of dye acid fuchsine with natural kaolinite modified with iron ions used as a catalyst for the fenton reaction the effectiveness of this process in decolouring solutions with different 50 100 150 and 200 mg l concentrations as tested in these studies the results make it clear that a higher pigment concentration is associated with lower efficiency but the reduction in efficiency is not proportional to the increase in concentration for example for a 50 mg l solution 100 degradation was achieved after 20 min of reaction while for a 100 mg l solution the efficiency after the same time was 90 on the other hand however higher concentrations increase the number of dbp molecules per unit volume and increase the likelihood of reaction between dbp and oxidising molecules leading to increased degradation efficiency this effect was observed in the reaction where the femncu5 catalyst was present compared after that were processes involving catalysts obtained by way of ion exchange or through impregnation the reaction was allowed to continue for either 60 or 240 min the results as mean values for 3 repetitions are as presented in fig 9 greater efficiency of the catalysts obtained by impregnation is revealed in the process with the femncu5 i catalyst almost complete removal of dbp was obtained after 60 min of reaction time the higher reaction rate is due to the greater number of ions involved in the reaction with hydrogen peroxide resulting in a higher number of hydroxyl radicals responsible for the reaction i e the degradation of dbp due to the high efficiency of the fe5 i and femncu5 catalysts it was decided to carry out processes with these catalysts without correcting the reaction mixture ph a comparison of the results obtained in these processes as opposed to their counterparts run in acidic solutions is as shown in fig 10 the graph reveals how these catalysts prove highly active whether the solution is at ph 3 or else at a ph of about 7 however greater efficiency of degradation of dbp was obtained in the solution with a neutral reaction regardless of the catalyst used 100 dbp removal was achieved 60 min into the reaction a similar relationship was noted in the study by idrissi and others 28 the highest degree of dye degradation was obtained in a solution at ph 7 as followed by ph 9 and then 5 the lowest efficiency was achieved where the solution was at ph 3 in this case this distribution was due to the zero point of catalyst charge which was about 8 when the ph was close to 8 the catalyst was charged negatively while crystal violet the removed substance was positively charged with therefore being a strong electrostatic attraction between the catalyst surface and the substance being removed as a result crystalline violet had easier contact with the active sites and was therefore degraded more easily where the ph of the solution was above 8 both the crystal violet and the catalyst were positively charged encouraging repulsion between molecules crystalline violet had limited contact with active areas therefore the effectiveness of wastewater decolouration was significantly more limited no such tests were carried out in this study so it is not possible to assess whether such an effect was also present in our case nevertheless the comparison of the catalysts obtained by impregnation with natural sediments and those modified using the ion exchange method reveals the higher metal content and lower ph of the impregnated versions with this perhaps explaining the similar results obtained irrespective of the initial ph of the reaction mixture 4 conclusions bottom sediment based catalysts could be prepared and used successfully in the role of heterogeneous catalyst in a fenton like system used in the degradation of di n butyl phthalate iron manganese and copper ions deposited in the bottom sediments serve as the active catalytic substances in the fenton reaction context the composition of bottom sediments makes it possible to use them in modification by way of ion exchange and impregnation methodologies ten modified catalysts based on bottom sediments were developed and found to have different contents of catalytically active substances all tested catalysts showed catalytic activity in the context of the fenton process however the most effective were those containing large amounts of iron the effectiveness of the fenton like process in dbp degradation is shown to depend on many parameters i e type and dose of sediment ph dose of h2o2 catalyst dose dbp concentration and reaction time a fenton process using a natural heterogeneous catalyst based on bottom sediments containing iron manganese and copper ions is an effective and environmentally friendly method of oxidising selected phthalic acid esters in aqueous solution the use of bottom sediments in chemical reactions represents an alternative way of managing dredged bottom sediments containing high concentrations of heavy metals the approach to the use of natural materials in catalytic processes is not only consistent with chemistry of a sustainable i e ecological and environmentally friendly nature but also cost effective given that processes managed in this way are less expensive the main limitation on the use of natural bottom sediments is the high content of organic matter and other impurities in the matrix 
14253,the work detailed here investigated the efficiency of fenton like processes in degrading endocrine disrupting chemicals as exemplified by di n butyl phthalate dbp specifically a heterogeneous fenton process was applied as catalyzed by natural or modified bottom sediments collected from rzeszów and solina reservoirs poland a number of sediments with different physicochemical properties and different contents of fe mn and cu were in fact obtained and used with modification entailing ion exchange reaction and impregnation it thus proved possible to demonstrate the possibility and legitimacy of fenton s reagent being modified by natural bottom sediments that may therefore be regarded as heterogeneous catalysts given a status as endogenous sources of iron manganese and copper ions while the effectiveness of dbp degradation was indeed influenced by sediment type and composition and modification thereof it was also affected by the factors of time ph dbp concentration sediment dose and h2o2 the use of natural bottom sediments in the role of solid catalysts in heterogeneous fenton processes represents a promising alternative to environmental remediation technology given their abundance low cost and environment friendly nature keywords bottom sediment endogenous catalysts heterogeneous fenton processes di n butyl phthalate green environmental remediation technology 1 introduction in recent years increasing attention has been paid to heterogeneous fenton like reactions while the classic fenton process sees soluble iron ii ions deployed in an acidic environment in such a way that oxidation takes place with part of the catalyst remaining in the treated wastewater and part precipitating out as fe oh 3 that then constitutes additional sediment heterogeneous catalysis sees the place of the soluble catalyst taken by a solid alternative that can be recovered and re used with only small amounts of fe passing through to the wastewater a further benefit of the heterogeneous catalyst is the way it extends the ph range across which the fenton reaction remains effective however as a heterogeneous catalyst is selected account needs to be taken of such characteristics as the content and degree of leaching of the ions present in the material as well as abrasion resistance ease of particle sedimentation to achieve separation from wastewater chemical stability and capacity for rapid regeneration and catalytic activity in the fenton reaction 1 8 in these contexts catalysts used in versions of the fenton reaction can either be classed as natural in the form of minerals soils or clays synthetic or obtained by means of modification of various materials fe0 or industrial waste catalysts in the first group have in fact proved to be excellent alternatives given their low cost high level of availability and catalytic activity and long term stability examples have included metal oxides and iron containing zeolites with particular success demonstrated in the cases of goethite pyrite hematite broadleaf and magnetite the most important zeolites making up deposits include clinoptilolite filipse chabasite and mordenite 9 11 silva et al 12 purified soil contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons using a fenton reaction whose only iron was that occurring naturally in the soils studied where the easily extractable iron content in soils 1 and 2 respectively were of 9 1 and 0 6 g kg in both cases a high 90 degree of removal of impurities was obtained where process parameters were optimal these studies confirmed the possibility of natural materials being used in the fenton process even with no modification necessary nevertheless a desire to improve on physicochemical properties and increase catalytic activity has encouraged effort to modify natural materials or engage in the synthesis of new ones of specific composition zeolites can be variously modified e g by co precipitation ion exchange impregnation and or encapsulation 3 4 further heterogeneous fenton process catalysts that have been made use of include ion exchange resins immobilised with fe iii ions 13 raschig glass rings 14 active alumina coated with an fe2o3 layer 15 granulated activated carbon impregnated with iron 16 17 and zeolites with fe iii ions or other transition metal ions immobilised on their surface 18 the composites and artificially produced modified materials studied in turn include fe2 ac α fe2o3 s cuo al feooh c iron iii on algae fibers iron oxide sio2 and magnetite based catalysts 19 described in this paper is a preliminary study on the use of natural and modified bottom sediments as heterogeneous catalysts in a fenton like process seeking to achieve effective degradation of dbp a known endocrine disrupting compound the basis for this approach lay in the status of bottom sediments as natural sources of iron manganese and copper and in the assumption that ions of these metals might be released sufficiently to ensure reactions with hydrogen peroxide mirroring those involving the classical fenton reagent di n butyl phthalate is the most frequently occurring pollutant in the natural environment and because it is soluble in water and stable in environmental conditions it is often detected in aquatic ecosystems landfill leachates and wastewater and even in drinking water typically the amounts of dbp in surface waters are in the range of 0 013 to 122 μg l there is often confirmation in the literature of much higher phthalates in surface waters e g the concentration of dehp in germany was recorded at 2700 μg l in italy 4600 μg l in landfill leachates there are much larger amounts of this compound up to 18 mg l on the other hand poor solubility of phthalates in water results in adsorption on suspended solid particles and accumulation in bottom sediments from 0 5 to 30 mg kg dry weight 20 22 due to the common occurrence of di n butyl phthalate in the aquatic environment and its negative impact on the environment and living organisms research has been undertaken to remove this compound from aqueous solutions 2 experimental section 2 1 bottom sediments collection and preliminary preparation samples of bottom sediment were collected once from rzeszów and solina reservoirs these sites differ in that the first of the bodies of water is under strong anthropopressure associated with local agriculture that causes severe land erosion with the result that bot the depositing of rubble and diffuse pollution take place 23 sampling made use of a gravity sediment corer kc kajak and samples obtained were pre cleaned and dried to an air dry state the bottom sediments were then ground in a mortar sieved through a 1 mm sieve and dried to constant mass at 105 c sediment ph content of organic matter and caco3 and content of fe mn and cu were then all determined prior to investigation of how substances leached from the sediment into aqueous solution 2 2 methodology of modification of bottom sediments ion exchange and impregnation methods were applied to enrich natural bottom sediments further with fe mn cu i e to obtain heterogeneous catalysts containing various amounts of catalytically active substances the for this purpose 500 ml of aqueous solutions containing specific concentrations of fe mn cu ions prepared by dissolving salts of these metals in distilled water 50 g portions of dried sediment were then added to the solutions and stirred on magnetic stirrers for 12 h the suspension obtained was then filtered before precipitates with repeat washed with distilled water and then dried to constant mass at 105 c for 12 h to obtain portions of the catalyst ready for use the impregnation method in turn involved mixing sediment with salt solution until the water had evaporated completely with further procedure then resembling that with ion exchange contents of fe mn and cu in the catalysts obtained were determined as was the degree of leaching of metals and other components into an aqueous medium 2 3 physicochemical analyses of sediments and catalysts to determine the ph of bottom sediments 2 g of air dried samples were weighed into centrifuge tubes and 25 ml of distilled water or 1 m kcl solution added prior to shaking for 5 min on a shaker suspensions were then left for 2 h and centrifuged before ph values were measured by immersing an electrode in the supernatant the content of organic matter was determined directly in terms of mass loss from sludge following roasting at high temperature for this purpose weighed 2 g portions of pre prepared bottom sediments were placed in crucibles transferred to a muffle furnace and roasted for 4 h at 550 c roasted samples were then cooled in an exicator and weighed on an analytical balance the percentage of organic matter om was calculated from the difference in mass between samples before and after ignition fe mn and cu concentrations in collected bottom sediments and obtained catalysts were determined following mineralisation of the samples the latter process used microwave energy in a multi station mars 6 mineraliser for this purpose 0 5 g portions of sediment were weighed out before being transferred to teflon vessels x press to which 10 ml of concentrated hno3 were added prior to being placed in the mineraliser sediment samples were left for two hours at room temperature to ensure that material was pre dissolved after cooling the solutions were filtered through a soft filter paper into volumetric flasks and diluted with distilled water to a volume of 50 ml the resulting solutions were then filtered through a 0 2 μm syringe filter prior to determinations for concentrations of metals being carried out using an icp oes spectrometer the leachability of substances metals and ions from the examined bottom sediments was investigated using pn z 15009 24 this entailed 1 g of sediment being placed in a conical flask along with 10 ml of distilled water to obtain the required solution ph values i e 3 or 7 h2so4 or naoh were dosed into the solutions the flask was then sealed with a stopper and shaken for 60 min determinations for the metals were then carried out by filtering the contents of the first flask into a 50 ml flask with 10 ml of hno3 added to the solution and the distillate made up to the mark with distilled water in aqueous extracts obtained in this wat determinations of metal concentrations were again made using an icp oes spectrometer to determine concentrations of selected ions in the extracts a leaching test similar to that for the metals was carried out determinations of inorganic anions and cations cl mg2 ca2 k na eluted from precipitates into solution were made using an ics 5000 ion chromatograph from dionex analysis was preceded by filtering of solutions through a 0 2 μm syringe filter and a membrane filter the caco3 content was determined by scheibler s method 2 4 removal of dbp from water using a modified fenton process the setup for the removal of dbp using fenton type processes consisted of a 4 position mixer and reactors beakers of capacity 50 500 ml these were filled periodically with a 5 mg l dbp solution with ph correction using a solution of h2so4 or naoh the heterogeneous fenton process used natural or modified bottom sediments with appropriate amounts of catalyst introduced into the dbp solution and the whole stirred for 0 5 h further ph correction followed with the h2o2 solution then introduced after an appropriate reaction time reaction solutions were neutralised to ph 8 9 using sodium hydroxide 20 ml of solution samples were then taken and the residual concentration of dbp assessed the effectiveness of this modified fenton process in degrading dbp in model aqueous solutions was investigated more thoroughly in relation to hydrogen peroxide dose catalyst dose initial solution ph value and concentration of the studied chemical compound and reaction time also analysed were change in reaction solution parameters and the leaching of selected chemical compounds from the applied sediments and catalysts into the reaction mixture 2 5 determination of dbp using gas chromatography dbp isolation involved solid phase extraction and determination using a gas chromatograph spe extraction procedure were as reported above 25 analysis of the dbp was performed using a gcms system coupling trace gc ultra with triplus to an itq 1100 thermo scientific dbp elimination in the processes studied was evaluated by reference to changes in concentration quantification of dbp was performed using internal calibration benzyl benzoate served as the internal standard by which dbp was quantified the linearity of the calibration curve has been tested over a range of dbp concentrations from 0 to 7 5 mg l with data obtained showing that across this range detector readings as a function of dbp concentrations remain linear r2 coefficient 0 99 average levels of dbp recovery from distilled water are in the 97 109 the limit of quantification loq was found at 53 μg l and the limit of detection lod at 20 μg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 use of natural bottom sediments detailed study on the catalytic activity of bottom sediments in degrading dbp was preceded by preliminary experiments inter alia seeking to exclude sorption of the test substance on sediments and reaction vessels as table 1 shows these were carried out on systems of differing composition processes were carried out for 240 min with sampling for analysis every 60 min the results obtained at this stage are shown in fig 1 our work precluded the sorption of dbp on either glass or sediments as well as showing that hydrogen peroxide alone could not remove the test compound completely given an oxidation reaction yield not exceeding 30 in contrast the result of using hydrogen peroxide in the presence of bottom sediments extracted from rzeszów reservoir was a significant increase in dbp degradation efficiency a 71 yield after 4 h of the process the classic four phase procedure for using a fenton reagent entails acidification of the reaction medium catalyst dosage dosage of hydrogen peroxide and final neutralisation however the use of bottom sediments following prior acidification of the reaction environment is found to increase ph value and hence reduce dbp removal efficiency significantly our studies thus had sediments dosed first with the solution only being acidified 30 min later with h2o2 then dosed during the processes it was also observed that the ph value of the solution changed which systematically increased and after about 2 h of the fenton process the reaction mixture was slightly acidic and after 4 h in some cases close to neutral this is an important advantage in terms of technology since after the process it is no longer necessary to neutralize the reaction solution in order to determine the possible cause of the ph value change an analysis of selected reaction solutions for the concentration of selected ions was carried out most likely the change in ph is the result of alkaline compounds leaching e g calcium and magnesium compounds from the bottom sediments catalysts into the reaction medium the effectiveness of fenton process dbp degradation was then considered in relation to the bottom sediments used from either rzeszów reservoir or solina reservoir as differences between removal efficiency after 120 and 180 min of the fenton heterogeneous process were found to be non significant sampling after 180 min was discontinued and the reaction time extended to 420 min the results obtained at this stage are as shown in fig 2 collected data show that type of sediment had an impact on the effectiveness of the fenton process with fuller degradation of dbp obtained with sediments originating from solina 60 min into the reaction the 60 yield was twice as high as that obtained using sediments from rzeszów reservoir in turn after 240 min complete degradation of dbp has been achieved where the process used solina sediments while even after 7 h the maximum rate of removal in the process using rzeszów sediments was 83 such differences presumably relate to physicochemical properties of sediments as detailed in table 2 while rzeszów reservoir sediments are slightly alkaline ph 7 88 7 95 those from solina are near neutral ph 6 54 6 67 however the main differences between the two lies in the om content as well as those of calcium carbonate and different metals specifically the rzeszów sediments contain twice as much organic matter ten times as much caco3 and levels of iron copper and manganese of 16 884 45 32 and 457 8 mg kg dm respectively 22 332 27 42 and 335 9 mg kg dm in solina sediments all the parameters described are capable of exerting a significant impact on the process by which dbp is degraded first a higher content of organic compounds requires higher doses of reagents and secondly the presence of both organic and inorganic contaminants e g carbonates scavenges hydroxyl radicals responsible for oxidation the strong effect of radical scavenging of oh by hco3 and co3 2 is shown in eqs 1 1 and 1 2 it is also worth mentioning the higher iron content in the solina sediments which could also account for more complete degradation of the tested pollutant 1 1 oh hco3 co3 h2o

over 40 mg was not merely associated with no higher level of pollutant degradation but was actually linked with a lower level of effectiveness the effect of initial dbp concentration on the course of a heterogeneous fenton process was also investigated because the concentration of impurities is an important parameter in wastewater treatment the results are shown in fig 8 as fig 8 shows a higher dbp concentration was associated with a level of degradation efficiency in relation to sediments from rzeszów reservoir that was lower by about 8 however in the case of the process using the femncu catalyst the efficiency was higher by about 15 one conclusion would hold that the lower the initial dbp concentration the shorter the reaction time needed to achieve complete degradation similar results were obtained by xu et al 30 in studies into the removal of dye acid fuchsine with natural kaolinite modified with iron ions used as a catalyst for the fenton reaction the effectiveness of this process in decolouring solutions with different 50 100 150 and 200 mg l concentrations as tested in these studies the results make it clear that a higher pigment concentration is associated with lower efficiency but the reduction in efficiency is not proportional to the increase in concentration for example for a 50 mg l solution 100 degradation was achieved after 20 min of reaction while for a 100 mg l solution the efficiency after the same time was 90 on the other hand however higher concentrations increase the number of dbp molecules per unit volume and increase the likelihood of reaction between dbp and oxidising molecules leading to increased degradation efficiency this effect was observed in the reaction where the femncu5 catalyst was present compared after that were processes involving catalysts obtained by way of ion exchange or through impregnation the reaction was allowed to continue for either 60 or 240 min the results as mean values for 3 repetitions are as presented in fig 9 greater efficiency of the catalysts obtained by impregnation is revealed in the process with the femncu5 i catalyst almost complete removal of dbp was obtained after 60 min of reaction time the higher reaction rate is due to the greater number of ions involved in the reaction with hydrogen peroxide resulting in a higher number of hydroxyl radicals responsible for the reaction i e the degradation of dbp due to the high efficiency of the fe5 i and femncu5 catalysts it was decided to carry out processes with these catalysts without correcting the reaction mixture ph a comparison of the results obtained in these processes as opposed to their counterparts run in acidic solutions is as shown in fig 10 the graph reveals how these catalysts prove highly active whether the solution is at ph 3 or else at a ph of about 7 however greater efficiency of degradation of dbp was obtained in the solution with a neutral reaction regardless of the catalyst used 100 dbp removal was achieved 60 min into the reaction a similar relationship was noted in the study by idrissi and others 28 the highest degree of dye degradation was obtained in a solution at ph 7 as followed by ph 9 and then 5 the lowest efficiency was achieved where the solution was at ph 3 in this case this distribution was due to the zero point of catalyst charge which was about 8 when the ph was close to 8 the catalyst was charged negatively while crystal violet the removed substance was positively charged with therefore being a strong electrostatic attraction between the catalyst surface and the substance being removed as a result crystalline violet had easier contact with the active sites and was therefore degraded more easily where the ph of the solution was above 8 both the crystal violet and the catalyst were positively charged encouraging repulsion between molecules crystalline violet had limited contact with active areas therefore the effectiveness of wastewater decolouration was significantly more limited no such tests were carried out in this study so it is not possible to assess whether such an effect was also present in our case nevertheless the comparison of the catalysts obtained by impregnation with natural sediments and those modified using the ion exchange method reveals the higher metal content and lower ph of the impregnated versions with this perhaps explaining the similar results obtained irrespective of the initial ph of the reaction mixture 4 conclusions bottom sediment based catalysts could be prepared and used successfully in the role of heterogeneous catalyst in a fenton like system used in the degradation of di n butyl phthalate iron manganese and copper ions deposited in the bottom sediments serve as the active catalytic substances in the fenton reaction context the composition of bottom sediments makes it possible to use them in modification by way of ion exchange and impregnation methodologies ten modified catalysts based on bottom sediments were developed and found to have different contents of catalytically active substances all tested catalysts showed catalytic activity in the context of the fenton process however the most effective were those containing large amounts of iron the effectiveness of the fenton like process in dbp degradation is shown to depend on many parameters i e type and dose of sediment ph dose of h2o2 catalyst dose dbp concentration and reaction time a fenton process using a natural heterogeneous catalyst based on bottom sediments containing iron manganese and copper ions is an effective and environmentally friendly method of oxidising selected phthalic acid esters in aqueous solution the use of bottom sediments in chemical reactions represents an alternative way of managing dredged bottom sediments containing high concentrations of heavy metals the approach to the use of natural materials in catalytic processes is not only consistent with chemistry of a sustainable i e ecological and environmentally friendly nature but also cost effective given that processes managed in this way are less expensive the main limitation on the use of natural bottom sediments is the high content of organic matter and other impurities in the matrix 
14254,removal of nitrogen based contaminants present in urine wastewater has become a considerable matter of concern because of its potentially harmful effects on human health and can cause alterations to aquatic life hence to avoid its dangerous effects electro assisted technology was employed for the voidance of this metabolite with the doped mixed metal oxide the influence of various input factors such as time ph current density and nacl dose on treatment efficiency in terms of percent degradation and energy consumption were evaluated using response surface methodology electrolysis results showed that 95 35 degradation of uric acid was achieved at optimized conditions in addition to reduce the treatment time further attempts have been made by incorporating dual effect i e photoelectrocatalysis the anode used for multiple runs were proven to be effectively stable through xrd and sem eds analysis of treated uric acid solution was validated in terms of cod 92 and toc 89 reduction the transformation products of uric acid were identified through lc ms based on these intermediates and literature survey an oxidative mechanism for uric acid has been proposed the total operating cost for electro oxidation treatment process is found to be 0 18 m3 keywords uric acid electro oxidation response surface methodology photo electrocatalysis doped mixed metal oxide anode 1 introduction in recent years it was predicted that in a developing country like india around 66 of the population still practice open defecation and urination 1 moreover it was observed that a great percent of underprivileged areas and urban slums are not connected to properly to any sewerage systems 2 this will eventually lead to the discharge of generated hazardous waste into nearby areas causing a wide range of health problems like malnutrition diarrhea anemia retarded growth etc due to contamination of soil and surface water 3 this depicts that huge proportion of the population living at risk of contamination of the environment by human fecal and urine wastewater one of primitive way is the separation of urine and fecal out of which fecal can be handled by traditional solid waste management tools and the reuse of urine for re flushing is something which can be worked on 4 human urine is mixed wastewater with complex chemical composition and contains most of the nitrogen based compounds such as urea uric acid creatinine etc among them uric acid is a principal component of urinal wastewater it is a primary enzymatic final breakdown product of dietary purine metabolism in the human body it is mainly present in human blood with a normal range of 250 mg day to 750 mg day with a period of over 24 h 5 in addition uric acid is excreted via urine 2 4 mg dl to 7 0 mg dl as bio refractory pollutant which leads to the serious alterations in the aquatic environment as well as can cause potential risk on human health 6 7 due to its toxicity persistence and recalcitrant to conventional treatment technologies there is an urgent requirement of some effective alternative technologies for the on site treatment of urinal wastewater electro oxidation process eo have proven their potential for destroying as well as mineralize the recalcitrant pollutants into simpler compounds 8 the process has received great attention for the treatment of mixed wastewater because of its effectiveness environmental compatibility economical involvement of clean reagent i e electron and provides easy process control 9 generally during electrolysis the mineralization of toxic organic substances into inorganic ions and biocompatible compounds takes place due to the in situ generation strong powerful non selective oxidant species of hydroxyl radicals oh on the electrode surface 10 in the development of the eo process technology electrodes play a very important key role reviews have been reported for the eo treatment of various toxic organic pollutants present in wastewater with the different type of anodes such as graphite glassy carbon pt ruo2 iro2 pbo2 sno2 boron doped diamond bdd and mixed metal oxide mmo 11 12 out of these bdd is found superior for the destruction of refectory pollutants and remediation of wastewaters 13 due to its high efficiency and exceptional compatibility but the main issue encountered with the bdd is their high cost difficulty in fabrication of coating complex shapes and formation of toxic byproducts such as chlorates perchlorates etc 14 15 unlike bdd mmo has low production cost easy fabrication highly stable with low oxygen potential saves energy cost at industrial scale and show similar properties of bdd by producing oh on anode surface 16 in past few years mmo anodes such as binary ir ta ir ru sn sb tertiary ir ru sn ir ru pt and quaternary ru ir sn ti have received a great deal of interest for removal of a wide range of toxic organic components present in water and wastewater 17 unlike others sno2 electrodes doped with antimony mmo have shown a high percentage of destruction along with the minimal formation of toxic byproduct 18 different type of electrodes have shown their worth in detecting the level of uric acid in serum and urine 19 26 but rarely discussed their removal the reason could be the complexity of urinal wastewater limitations for on site treatment and process complications the present study attempts to cover some of these pitfalls using a novel combination of different active non active metals that is sb sn ta ir ti quaternary anode has been chosen for the treatment of uric acid in order to get excellent resistance properties and good service life iridium ir was incorporated tantalum ta provides high current densities and enable the anode to work on high values of applied current without causing any damage the integration of tin sn was done to get more active sites for the generation of reactive oxygen species antimony sb was doped in order to increases the conductivity of anode as well as lowers the oxygen evolution overpotential 27 to our best knowledge this is one of the few reported studies for the treatment of uric acid using novel quaternary doped mmo systematic studies using response surface methodology were carried out in order to establish the process conditions where uric acid has been eliminated completely from an aqueous medium the efficiency of the treatment process was evaluated in terms of responses percent degradation and energy consumption in fact this is the first reported study of doped mmo with more than 55 recycles for studying the degradation of uric acid in aqueous solution the electrochemical stability of anode was analyzed through different characterization facilities the quality of treated effluent was also validated using different analytical techniques 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials uric acid c5h4n4o3 of analytical grade 99 5 purity supplied by sigma aldrich missouri u s sulfuric acid sodium hydroxide sodium sulfate and sodium chloride were all of the analytical grade and purchased from loba chemi pvt ltd india the double distilled water was utilized for the preparation of all solutions stainless steel ss used as cathode and doped mmo used as an anode were procured from bio age pvt ltd and exotic elements pvt ltd india respectively dc supply with the model 0 30 v 0 2 a was purchased from digitech ambala india 2 2 experimental setup and procedure the uric acid solution was prepared fresh every time by dissolving 50 mg in 1 l double distilled water for eo experiments a single compartment cell made up of borax glass beaker having a working volume of 400 ml was used see graphical abstract single pair of doped mmo and ss plates having dimensions 7 cm 7 cm 1 cm with an effective working surface area of 42 cm2 were used in each experimental run in this study both electrodes were placed parallel with inter electrode spacing was maintained at 2 0 cm for every experiment during electrolysis the current was maintained throughout the experiment run using dc power supply for proper homogeneous mixing of the aqueous solution during experimental runs magnetic stirrer was used all experiments were performed under controlled temperature conditions of 25 c eo experiments for the treatment of uric acid were performed under galvanostatic conditions before electrolysis aliquots of h2so4 0 1 n and naoh 0 1 n were added in order to adjust the solution ph to the desired level at certain time intervals samples of 1 ml volume were taken out from the solution and filtered using 0 45 μm nylon filters and analyzed through uv vis at λmax 290 nm all experiments were performed thrice in order to check the reproducibility of results and suitable statics were applied for the validation of results the final ph of the uric acid solution was stabilized at 4 75 2 3 analytical methods for the analytical evaluation of the withdrawn samples several instruments were used in the present study 28 33 the detailed procedure and information regarding the equipment have been provided in the supplementary information scheme s1 2 4 experimental design for designing the experimental data for eo treatment of uric acid with doped mmo box behnken design bbd under response surface methodology rsm was employed the detailed description of experimental design using rsm has been given in supplementary information scheme s2 34 36 in order to evaluate the performance of eo treatment process four input parameters like current density nacl dose treatment time and ph and two responses i e degradation and energy consumed were selected the responses for eo treatment process were calculated by the following eqs 1 and 2 37 1 y 1 c 0 c t c 0 100 2 y 2 v i t v s 10 3 where c0 initial uric acid concentration mg l ct uric acid concentration at different time intervals mg l i current a v cell voltage t treatment time h vs solution volume l y1 degradation and y2 energy

1 t 2 6 operating cost analysis the overall cost for the treatment process includes the cost of electrodes cost of stirring cost of chemical and electrical energy consumed however the process is found to be energy intensive therefore total cost for operation is due to the electrode cost and electrical power consumed hence in this study the total operating cost for the eo process was calculated using the following eq 6 6 operating cost cec cel where cec cost of energy consumed kwh m3 and cel cost of electrodes rs the price of electricity in punjab india rs 5 00 kwh the cost of the doped mmo anode is rs 820 per piece the manufacturer supplier has specified the life span of the electrode is 5 years 3 result and discussion the present statistical investigation was carried out through design expert software version 6 0 8 stat ease inc minneapolis us in order to minimize the void content and to optimize the experimental data all the experimental runs were performed according to the design given by bbd as listed in table 1 a quadratic model was suggested by exploiting sequential f test and other adequacy measures 38 the results of model summary statistics showed the highest r2 values of both responses for the quadratic model i e 0 9629 and 0 9907 respectively this advocates that model has explained the experimental data very well and indicate the satisfactory interaction between predicted and observed values of experimental runs hence the model chosen was quadratic which was used to describe the effect of various operational process parameters on the treatment of uric acid using the eo process for processing the chosen quadratic model manual regression method was applied in which insignificant model terms were evicted automatically and provide compiled results with a reduced quadratic equation table 2 shows the results of the quadratic model fitting in the form of analysis of variance anova the detailed description of anova results was given in supplementary information scheme s3 41 to check the reliability of chosen models for both responses plots of normal probability vs studentized residuals as depicted in fig 1 and studentized residuals vs predicted discussed scheme s3 from the plots it was observed that the points on this plot lie fairly close to the diagonal straight line which indicates that the model well satisfies the assumptions of the anova 42 moreover it also depicts that a normal plot is also a suitable graphical method for judging residuals normality and confirms the normal distribution of the observed data 3 1 effect of process parameters and optimization three dimensional 3d response graphs developed were studied in order to see the interactive effect of each operational parameters on responses as well as used to locate the optimal conditions for process parameters 3 1 1 effect of j n t and ph on degradation y1 fig 2 a shows the interaction between current density j and ph as well as their effect on y1 in the eo treatment study it was always found that j considered an important operating process factor because of the cost effective analysis moreover transferring of electrons generation of oxidant species and process efficiency all depends upon applied j it can be seen that when j increased from 2 38 ma cm2 to 9 52 ma cm2 y1 was also increased because of increase in production of electrons during electrolysis which in turn has increased the generation of strong oxidants but the further increase in values of j from 9 52 ma cm2 to 11 90 ma cm2 y1 was found constant this trend was observed at ph 3 5 furthermore when ph was increased from 3 5 to 11 it has been found that y1 increases gradually with increasing j values upto 7 14 ma cm2 then become decreasing with increasing j values this happened because at very low and high values of j generation of reactive chlorine species rcs and reactive oxygen species ros on doped mmo were falling down gradually with time due to which the current efficiency of other side reactions such as oxygen evolution reaction increased but on increasing j values from lower value helps in generation of more oxidants such as oh hclo clo etc the ph of the solution is considered as a crucial factor for influencing the eo process performance from results it was observed that maximum y1 was achieved at lower values of ph this was due to the high adsorption rate of generated oh in the oxide lattice of the anode at acidic ph 43 in the eo process both mechanisms direct and indirect oxidation takes place simultaneously for the maximum degradation of target pollutant the generation rate of reactive oxidant species like oh ozone ho2 and rcs along with the capability of e transfer is highly dependent upon the j and solution ph many studies in the literature have confirmed that doped mmo acts as active anode and reactions occur on its surface during the eo treatment is the water oxidation reactions which in turn leading to the formation of adsorbed oh and led to direct oxidation of compound furthermore at acidic ph the generation of the strong oxidant species with high oxidant potential such as oh hclo clo in the bulk was more which indirectly oxidize the target pollutant while in the case of basic ph it was found that the concentration of lower potential oxidant species such as h2o2 ho 2 clo3 and clo4 was more 44 thus degradation of uric acid was found minimum at neutral and basic ph therefore the oxidation of the target pollutant was found to be maximum at acidic ph because of the involvement of both mechanisms direct and indirect eo the concentration of nacl n always plays a significant role because it influences the efficiency of the process by generating rcs in the bulk from the response graph fig 2b it has been observed that for lower values of n 0 5 g l and t 17 5 min y1 was found constant further increase in values of n 0 5 1 0 g l and t 17 5 min 42 5 min it was found that y1 was also increased however when n and t were increased further to 1 25 g l at 55 min y1 was found remained almost unchanged from the results it was concluded that an increase in the y1 may be attributed due to the change in the ionic strength of the solution the increase in ionic strength at higher values of n will generally cause an increase in current density in the same cell voltage and hence maximum y1 was achieved 45 it observed that after certain values of n and j y1 was found the minimum this might be happening due to the i scavenging of oh by high chloride dose ii formation of more chloramines in the system 46 ii metal dissolution which leads to the formation of bigger flocs iii most of the applied current consume by gas evolution and side reactions and iv increases the temperature of the solution moreover it was observed that prolonged eo at higher j values always leads to the fouling of the anode because of the bond formation between pollutant and oxide lattice of an anode which grows like an impermeable film with time hence for better process performance and longer service life of anodes optimization of process variables is very important 3 1 2 effect of j n t and ph on energy consumption y2 from fig 2c it can be seen that at lower values of n 0 25 g l y2 was found maximum for all values of ph but further increase in n values from 0 25 g l to 0 75 g l y2 was found minimum this trend was observed for all values of ph however further increase in n value 1 0 g l y1 was found increased at all values of ph thereafter it was observed that at very high values of n 1 25 g l y1 found maximum at lower 3 and higher 11 values of ph while minimum at ph from 5 to 9 at lower values of n the conductivity of the solution was also lower due to which an increase in voltage drops took place which further leads to the increase in y2 value while at higher values of n y2 was found to be minimal because of the ease of current flow through the electrolyte solution from fig 2d it can be seen that with increasing j and t values y2 was also found increasing this might happened because electrical power consumption is directly proportional to the current and time 47 however it was found that the effect of ph on y2 was found to be marginal or less when compared to other parameters 3 1 3 optimization for the present study simultaneous optimization of multi responses was done in order to find out optimized conditions for eo treatment of uric acid using doped mmo 39 optimum conditions selected for both responses were done in such a way that y1 should come out to be maximum and y2 should be minimized this optimization technique basically evaluates a point that maximizes the desirability function the optimum conditions obtained using desirability function approach were j 7 46 ma cm2 n 1 11 g l ph 3 25 and t 42 79 min along with combined desirability value d 0 880 under these conditions value for responses y1 and y2 were 97 20 and 2 588 kw h m3 respectively as suggested by bbd as shown in table 3 to validate these results further additional experiments have been performed at optimized conditions the value of the response y1 95 35 and y2 2 479 kw h m3 which was found in close agreement to the predicted values as listed in table 4 on seeing the good correlation between predicted and observed values depicts the reliability of incorporating the desirability function approach by bbd and has effectively optimized the process parameters for the eo treatment of uric acid 3 2 synergistic studies as discussed in section 2 5 synergistic studies have been performed using kinetic rate constant obtained through pseudo first order reactions the oxidation experiments of uric acid were performed with doped mmo in a batch reactor and three different techniques were applied which include photo catalysis only light source eo constant current supply only and photoelectrocatalysis constant applied current and light fig 3 shows that only 12 under solar light and 8 5 under uv degradation of uric acid were achieved through photocatalysis after 1 h in case of photoelectrocatalysis 89 5 under uv light and 96 under solar radiation degradation of uric acid were achieved within 30 min of electrolysis while eo took almost 1 h to reach that value 95 35 moreover an immense increase in the first order rate constant in case of the integrated process 0 0854 min 1 which was 3 4 times of photo catalysis 0 0025 min 1 and 1 4 times as compared to eo 0 0616 min 1 confirms the viability of dual process over single treatment processes as shown in fig 4 the synergistic effect of the dual process over eo came out to be 27 86 and over photocatalysis it was 97 07 as quantified from eq 5 while the overall synergy of the dual process was found to be 24 94 as calculated from eq 6 therefore it concludes that the dual process with synergistic results prompts it field scale applications for the wastewater treatment with a significant decrease in treatment time to further confirm our claim experimental studies were carried out using fluorescence spectroscopy for the estimation of oh production at doped mmo under different light sources fig 5 a showed that maximum oh production was found under solar radiations photoelectrocatalysis than uv and eo this might happen due to the activation of photoactive layers i e tio2 and sno2 of anode under light sources leading to the generation of more oh on the surface of anode resulting more percentage degradation of uric acid in less time some researchers have also reported that doping can improve the photoactivity of the anode by increasing the charge separation of holes and electrons 48 in order to verify the effect of ph on the generation of oh experiments were performed at different ph from the results it was found that more oh production was observed at basic ph over acidic and neutral ph fig 5b but at the same time it was also observed that in the case of basic and neutral ph generation of oh decreases with increasing time while in the case of acidic ph it was opposite hence this advocates that degradation of uric acid was found to be largely due to indirect oxidation and minutely by oh at optimized conditions 3 3 durability studies the economy of the treatment process for the pilot scale applications majorly depends upon the stability of the anode 49 thus in order to evaluate its ability to oxidize the pollutant the doped mmo anodes were used for multiple time in all extreme conditions from fig 6 it was found that despite the harsh conditions doped mmo performed significantly well even after 55 recycles 64 166 h without much substantial loss in electro oxidation process efficiency the stability of theses active doped mmo was due to the incorporation of different metal oxide combinations which not only increased its service life as well as enhanced its electrochemical activity for a longer period of time to further confirm its stability as well as to investigate the electrochemical and photochemical properties anodes were characterized through sem eds and xrd analysis as described in section 3 4 3 4 characterization of a doped mmo anode fig 7 a c shows the sem images of the ti sheet without any coating freshly coated anode and recycled anodes from the image fig 7b it was observed that thermally decomposed prepared anode exhibits a slightly rough porous smaller and shallower mud cracked type structure thus depicted anode with enhanced working area a larger active working area resulted in an increased catalytic activity which further facilitates the lowering of effective current density 50 the appearance of cracks on the fabricated anode surface depicts that the islands white bright spots are made up of different oxide layers with an average width of 5 μm 51 the presence of ti as a substrate in the anode has helped in the formation of the oxide layer of tio2 which is uv active helps in the generation of oh at the anode surface 52 addition of ta in the anode has enabled the anode to work at higher values of current without causing any damage to an anode 53 moreover the results are consistent with other reported studies that show the incorporation of sb and sn has affected the morphology by improving the structure of coatings the sem image of recycling anode fig 7c showed relatively identical surface characteristics and morphology thus confirms the uniformity of different metal oxide layer even after fifty five recycles for an elemental composition of the different metal oxides coated on anode surface freshly as well as recycled doped mmo eds was performed the stability of novel doped mmo was further proven with the presence of a predominant peak of all the five elements i e sb sn ir ta o and ti even in the recycled sheet eds data inset depicts the quantitative analysis in terms of molecular concentration of different metals in the oxide mixture which seemed almost the same in both fresh and recycle anode thus confirming the stability of anodes even after 55 recycles fig 8 a c shows x ray diffractogram xrd of a ti sheet only the freshly coated and recycled plate xrd helps to identify the existence of different metals in the oxide mixture from results it was clearly seen that the sharp peaks of tio2 with rutile phase few peaks of anatase ti along with the characteristic reflection of sno2 with rutile type structure this indicates that the mixed coating of different metals has covered the surface of the ti substrate significantly 54 despite the incorporation of doping ions into sno2 with low doping level few diffraction peaks of sb was still observed in xrd spectra 55 the peak of iro2 and ta2o5 were also confirmed from xrd spectra furthermore the same peaks of oxides of metal were observed in recycled doped mmo hence confirming the confinement of all metal oxide even after multiple runs it was observed that few metal oxide peaks were deviated from their original position due to loss of some amount of metals in the multiple runs of the experiment further details regarding the diffractions peaks have been discussed in scheme s4 56 57 3 5 mineralization studies the mineralization studies of uric acid were performed using spectrophotometric analysis fig 9 for the treated samples initially and to further confirm the degradation of uric acid some analytical test such as cod toc total available chlorine tac and inorganic ions were performed at optimized conditions fig 10 a shows the results of mineralization of uric acid in terms of reduction of cod and toc more than 90 decrement in cod and 80 reduction in toc were observed in 43 min when treatment was further continued to 70 min it was found that reduction in cod and toc became constant depicting that oxidation of uric acid into byproducts was completed production of inorganic ions such as no2 nh4 and no3 were observed after 5 min of eo treatment of uric acid as shown in fig 10b furthermore it was also observed that the concentration of nitrite ion decreased after 15 min of electrolysis while nh4 got reduced after 30 min of eo treatment in the case of no3 concentration a continuously increasing trend was observed this might be due to the oxidation of no2 and nh4 by strong oxidants such as oh hocl etc into nitrate ions as per reported in literature studies 5 fig 10c depicts the decreasing concentration of cl 1 and increasing concentration of tac because of the oxidation of cl 1 into strong oxidant species such as active chlorine hocl ocl for the electrolytic treatment of uric acid while tac is comprised of the sum of all forms of chlorine species and combined chlorine species which results from a reaction with nitrogenous organic and inorganic ions 58 during eo treatment of uric acid its removal phenomena from aqueous solution at different time intervals were investigated through ft ir spectra from fig 11 it was found that most of the peaks were got shifted distinct wave number this might be due to the structural changes occurred during the eo process some of the broad and sharp peaks during electrolysis were found disappeared due to the oxidation of uric acid and its intermediates via reactive oxidant species furthermore few peaks during electrolysis were seemed to appear which accounts for oh and chlorine species as reported in the literature 59 60 moreover the transmittance for maximum peaks was found increased after a treatment time of 55 min which indicates that the oxidation of uric acid was complete and converted into simple compounds fig 12 shows the continuous cvs for the eo treatment of uric acid of 50 mg l at platinum rod with potential range of 1 2 to 1 2 v as it can be seen that in 0 h sample untreated of uric acid one oxidation peak at 0 2 v potential in cycle 1 and one reduction peak at 0 7 v in cycle 2 were observed however in the case of the treated sample cycle 1 shows the disappearance of oxidation peak while cycle 2 exhibit a remarkable decrease in reduction peak the dissolution shifting of peaks depicts the formation of simpler oxidative and reductive species during the degradation of uric acid with a doped mmo anode 26 moreover decreased oxidation peak potential and enhanced oxidation peak current indicates the great electro catalytic activity towards the oxidation of uric acid and amplified active electrochemical surface area 25 to further examine the possible intermediates formed during eo treatment were identified through lc ms analysis on the basis of the results of lc ms analysis a possible oxidative pathway of uric acid has been proposed in fig 13 the reduction in uric acid led to the formation of intermediates 2 which further undergo through successive mechanisms such as cn bond cleavage dehydroxylation deamination etc and yield final byproducts 9 11 the final products of the oxidative pathway of uric acid have also been reported in the literature studies 5 44 the mass spectra from which the degradation pathway proposed were shown in fig s3 3 6 economic evaluation in order to visualize the successful commercialization of a process treatment technology must provide a significant reduction in the overall cost of the treatment process over conventional techniques in the case of eo treatment unit the overall economy for removal of per kg of uric acid came out to be 0 18 m3 table s2 the results depict a sustainable solution for the on site treatment of urinal wastewaters in terms of economic feasibility of eo process as well as the stability of anodes however the overall cost could be reduced further during scale up studies by modifying the reactor design and operating conditions accordingly 4 conclusion the present study depicts the successful applicability of novel fabricated doped mmo for the eo treatment of target compound that is uric acid parametric optimization for the treatment process was done using bbd in which the desirability function approach found suitable for simultaneous minimization of energy consumption and maximization of degradation the degradation of uric acid was found maximum due to the generation of strong oxidants like hocl ocl oh during electrolysis the dual effect of two processes has shown the synergistic effect on the degradation of uric acid as better degradation was achieved in lesser time characterization techniques like sem eds and xrd have proved the durability and stability of doped mmo in terms of significant degradation of uric acid even after 55 recycles uv vis ftir and lc ms analysis were used for the detection of intermediates formed during the treatment process at different time intervals furthermore future investigations would emphasize more techno economic analysis of field scale applications such as on site treatment of urinal wastewater and reuse as flush water appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online version at doi https doi org 10

14254,removal of nitrogen based contaminants present in urine wastewater has become a considerable matter of concern because of its potentially harmful effects on human health and can cause alterations to aquatic life hence to avoid its dangerous effects electro assisted technology was employed for the voidance of this metabolite with the doped mixed metal oxide the influence of various input factors such as time ph current density and nacl dose on treatment efficiency in terms of percent degradation and energy consumption were evaluated using response surface methodology electrolysis results showed that 95 35 degradation of uric acid was achieved at optimized conditions in addition to reduce the treatment time further attempts have been made by incorporating dual effect i e photoelectrocatalysis the anode used for multiple runs were proven to be effectively stable through xrd and sem eds analysis of treated uric acid solution was validated in terms of cod 92 and toc 89 reduction the transformation products of uric acid were identified through lc ms based on these intermediates and literature survey an oxidative mechanism for uric acid has been proposed the total operating cost for electro oxidation treatment process is found to be 0 18 m3 keywords uric acid electro oxidation response surface methodology photo electrocatalysis doped mixed metal oxide anode 1 introduction in recent years it was predicted that in a developing country like india around 66 of the population still practice open defecation and urination 1 moreover it was observed that a great percent of underprivileged areas and urban slums are not connected to properly to any sewerage systems 2 this will eventually lead to the discharge of generated hazardous waste into nearby areas causing a wide range of health problems like malnutrition diarrhea anemia retarded growth etc due to contamination of soil and surface water 3 this depicts that huge proportion of the population living at risk of contamination of the environment by human fecal and urine wastewater one of primitive way is the separation of urine and fecal out of which fecal can be handled by traditional solid waste management tools and the reuse of urine for re flushing is something which can be worked on 4 human urine is mixed wastewater with complex chemical composition and contains most of the nitrogen based compounds such as urea uric acid creatinine etc among them uric acid is a principal component of urinal wastewater it is a primary enzymatic final breakdown product of dietary purine metabolism in the human body it is mainly present in human blood with a normal range of 250 mg day to 750 mg day with a period of over 24 h 5 in addition uric acid is excreted via urine 2 4 mg dl to 7 0 mg dl as bio refractory pollutant which leads to the serious alterations in the aquatic environment as well as can cause potential risk on human health 6 7 due to its toxicity persistence and recalcitrant to conventional treatment technologies there is an urgent requirement of some effective alternative technologies for the on site treatment of urinal wastewater electro oxidation process eo have proven their potential for destroying as well as mineralize the recalcitrant pollutants into simpler compounds 8 the process has received great attention for the treatment of mixed wastewater because of its effectiveness environmental compatibility economical involvement of clean reagent i e electron and provides easy process control 9 generally during electrolysis the mineralization of toxic organic substances into inorganic ions and biocompatible compounds takes place due to the in situ generation strong powerful non selective oxidant species of hydroxyl radicals oh on the electrode surface 10 in the development of the eo process technology electrodes play a very important key role reviews have been reported for the eo treatment of various toxic organic pollutants present in wastewater with the different type of anodes such as graphite glassy carbon pt ruo2 iro2 pbo2 sno2 boron doped diamond bdd and mixed metal oxide mmo 11 12 out of these bdd is found superior for the destruction of refectory pollutants and remediation of wastewaters 13 due to its high efficiency and exceptional compatibility but the main issue encountered with the bdd is their high cost difficulty in fabrication of coating complex shapes and formation of toxic byproducts such as chlorates perchlorates etc 14 15 unlike bdd mmo has low production cost easy fabrication highly stable with low oxygen potential saves energy cost at industrial scale and show similar properties of bdd by producing oh on anode surface 16 in past few years mmo anodes such as binary ir ta ir ru sn sb tertiary ir ru sn ir ru pt and quaternary ru ir sn ti have received a great deal of interest for removal of a wide range of toxic organic components present in water and wastewater 17 unlike others sno2 electrodes doped with antimony mmo have shown a high percentage of destruction along with the minimal formation of toxic byproduct 18 different type of electrodes have shown their worth in detecting the level of uric acid in serum and urine 19 26 but rarely discussed their removal the reason could be the complexity of urinal wastewater limitations for on site treatment and process complications the present study attempts to cover some of these pitfalls using a novel combination of different active non active metals that is sb sn ta ir ti quaternary anode has been chosen for the treatment of uric acid in order to get excellent resistance properties and good service life iridium ir was incorporated tantalum ta provides high current densities and enable the anode to work on high values of applied current without causing any damage the integration of tin sn was done to get more active sites for the generation of reactive oxygen species antimony sb was doped in order to increases the conductivity of anode as well as lowers the oxygen evolution overpotential 27 to our best knowledge this is one of the few reported studies for the treatment of uric acid using novel quaternary doped mmo systematic studies using response surface methodology were carried out in order to establish the process conditions where uric acid has been eliminated completely from an aqueous medium the efficiency of the treatment process was evaluated in terms of responses percent degradation and energy consumption in fact this is the first reported study of doped mmo with more than 55 recycles for studying the degradation of uric acid in aqueous solution the electrochemical stability of anode was analyzed through different characterization facilities the quality of treated effluent was also validated using different analytical techniques 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials uric acid c5h4n4o3 of analytical grade 99 5 purity supplied by sigma aldrich missouri u s sulfuric acid sodium hydroxide sodium sulfate and sodium chloride were all of the analytical grade and purchased from loba chemi pvt ltd india the double distilled water was utilized for the preparation of all solutions stainless steel ss used as cathode and doped mmo used as an anode were procured from bio age pvt ltd and exotic elements pvt ltd india respectively dc supply with the model 0 30 v 0 2 a was purchased from digitech ambala india 2 2 experimental setup and procedure the uric acid solution was prepared fresh every time by dissolving 50 mg in 1 l double distilled water for eo experiments a single compartment cell made up of borax glass beaker having a working volume of 400 ml was used see graphical abstract single pair of doped mmo and ss plates having dimensions 7 cm 7 cm 1 cm with an effective working surface area of 42 cm2 were used in each experimental run in this study both electrodes were placed parallel with inter electrode spacing was maintained at 2 0 cm for every experiment during electrolysis the current was maintained throughout the experiment run using dc power supply for proper homogeneous mixing of the aqueous solution during experimental runs magnetic stirrer was used all experiments were performed under controlled temperature conditions of 25 c eo experiments for the treatment of uric acid were performed under galvanostatic conditions before electrolysis aliquots of h2so4 0 1 n and naoh 0 1 n were added in order to adjust the solution ph to the desired level at certain time intervals samples of 1 ml volume were taken out from the solution and filtered using 0 45 μm nylon filters and analyzed through uv vis at λmax 290 nm all experiments were performed thrice in order to check the reproducibility of results and suitable statics were applied for the validation of results the final ph of the uric acid solution was stabilized at 4 75 2 3 analytical methods for the analytical evaluation of the withdrawn samples several instruments were used in the present study 28 33 the detailed procedure and information regarding the equipment have been provided in the supplementary information scheme s1 2 4 experimental design for designing the experimental data for eo treatment of uric acid with doped mmo box behnken design bbd under response surface methodology rsm was employed the detailed description of experimental design using rsm has been given in supplementary information scheme s2 34 36 in order to evaluate the performance of eo treatment process four input parameters like current density nacl dose treatment time and ph and two responses i e degradation and energy consumed were selected the responses for eo treatment process were calculated by the following eqs 1 and 2 37 1 y 1 c 0 c t c 0 100 2 y 2 v i t v s 10 3 where c0 initial uric acid concentration mg l ct uric acid concentration at different time intervals mg l i current a v cell voltage t treatment time h vs solution volume l y1 degradation and y2 energy

1 t 2 6 operating cost analysis the overall cost for the treatment process includes the cost of electrodes cost of stirring cost of chemical and electrical energy consumed however the process is found to be energy intensive therefore total cost for operation is due to the electrode cost and electrical power consumed hence in this study the total operating cost for the eo process was calculated using the following eq 6 6 operating cost cec cel where cec cost of energy consumed kwh m3 and cel cost of electrodes rs the price of electricity in punjab india rs 5 00 kwh the cost of the doped mmo anode is rs 820 per piece the manufacturer supplier has specified the life span of the electrode is 5 years 3 result and discussion the present statistical investigation was carried out through design expert software version 6 0 8 stat ease inc minneapolis us in order to minimize the void content and to optimize the experimental data all the experimental runs were performed according to the design given by bbd as listed in table 1 a quadratic model was suggested by exploiting sequential f test and other adequacy measures 38 the results of model summary statistics showed the highest r2 values of both responses for the quadratic model i e 0 9629 and 0 9907 respectively this advocates that model has explained the experimental data very well and indicate the satisfactory interaction between predicted and observed values of experimental runs hence the model chosen was quadratic which was used to describe the effect of various operational process parameters on the treatment of uric acid using the eo process for processing the chosen quadratic model manual regression method was applied in which insignificant model terms were evicted automatically and provide compiled results with a reduced quadratic equation table 2 shows the results of the quadratic model fitting in the form of analysis of variance anova the detailed description of anova results was given in supplementary information scheme s3 41 to check the reliability of chosen models for both responses plots of normal probability vs studentized residuals as depicted in fig 1 and studentized residuals vs predicted discussed scheme s3 from the plots it was observed that the points on this plot lie fairly close to the diagonal straight line which indicates that the model well satisfies the assumptions of the anova 42 moreover it also depicts that a normal plot is also a suitable graphical method for judging residuals normality and confirms the normal distribution of the observed data 3 1 effect of process parameters and optimization three dimensional 3d response graphs developed were studied in order to see the interactive effect of each operational parameters on responses as well as used to locate the optimal conditions for process parameters 3 1 1 effect of j n t and ph on degradation y1 fig 2 a shows the interaction between current density j and ph as well as their effect on y1 in the eo treatment study it was always found that j considered an important operating process factor because of the cost effective analysis moreover transferring of electrons generation of oxidant species and process efficiency all depends upon applied j it can be seen that when j increased from 2 38 ma cm2 to 9 52 ma cm2 y1 was also increased because of increase in production of electrons during electrolysis which in turn has increased the generation of strong oxidants but the further increase in values of j from 9 52 ma cm2 to 11 90 ma cm2 y1 was found constant this trend was observed at ph 3 5 furthermore when ph was increased from 3 5 to 11 it has been found that y1 increases gradually with increasing j values upto 7 14 ma cm2 then become decreasing with increasing j values this happened because at very low and high values of j generation of reactive chlorine species rcs and reactive oxygen species ros on doped mmo were falling down gradually with time due to which the current efficiency of other side reactions such as oxygen evolution reaction increased but on increasing j values from lower value helps in generation of more oxidants such as oh hclo clo etc the ph of the solution is considered as a crucial factor for influencing the eo process performance from results it was observed that maximum y1 was achieved at lower values of ph this was due to the high adsorption rate of generated oh in the oxide lattice of the anode at acidic ph 43 in the eo process both mechanisms direct and indirect oxidation takes place simultaneously for the maximum degradation of target pollutant the generation rate of reactive oxidant species like oh ozone ho2 and rcs along with the capability of e transfer is highly dependent upon the j and solution ph many studies in the literature have confirmed that doped mmo acts as active anode and reactions occur on its surface during the eo treatment is the water oxidation reactions which in turn leading to the formation of adsorbed oh and led to direct oxidation of compound furthermore at acidic ph the generation of the strong oxidant species with high oxidant potential such as oh hclo clo in the bulk was more which indirectly oxidize the target pollutant while in the case of basic ph it was found that the concentration of lower potential oxidant species such as h2o2 ho 2 clo3 and clo4 was more 44 thus degradation of uric acid was found minimum at neutral and basic ph therefore the oxidation of the target pollutant was found to be maximum at acidic ph because of the involvement of both mechanisms direct and indirect eo the concentration of nacl n always plays a significant role because it influences the efficiency of the process by generating rcs in the bulk from the response graph fig 2b it has been observed that for lower values of n 0 5 g l and t 17 5 min y1 was found constant further increase in values of n 0 5 1 0 g l and t 17 5 min 42 5 min it was found that y1 was also increased however when n and t were increased further to 1 25 g l at 55 min y1 was found remained almost unchanged from the results it was concluded that an increase in the y1 may be attributed due to the change in the ionic strength of the solution the increase in ionic strength at higher values of n will generally cause an increase in current density in the same cell voltage and hence maximum y1 was achieved 45 it observed that after certain values of n and j y1 was found the minimum this might be happening due to the i scavenging of oh by high chloride dose ii formation of more chloramines in the system 46 ii metal dissolution which leads to the formation of bigger flocs iii most of the applied current consume by gas evolution and side reactions and iv increases the temperature of the solution moreover it was observed that prolonged eo at higher j values always leads to the fouling of the anode because of the bond formation between pollutant and oxide lattice of an anode which grows like an impermeable film with time hence for better process performance and longer service life of anodes optimization of process variables is very important 3 1 2 effect of j n t and ph on energy consumption y2 from fig 2c it can be seen that at lower values of n 0 25 g l y2 was found maximum for all values of ph but further increase in n values from 0 25 g l to 0 75 g l y2 was found minimum this trend was observed for all values of ph however further increase in n value 1 0 g l y1 was found increased at all values of ph thereafter it was observed that at very high values of n 1 25 g l y1 found maximum at lower 3 and higher 11 values of ph while minimum at ph from 5 to 9 at lower values of n the conductivity of the solution was also lower due to which an increase in voltage drops took place which further leads to the increase in y2 value while at higher values of n y2 was found to be minimal because of the ease of current flow through the electrolyte solution from fig 2d it can be seen that with increasing j and t values y2 was also found increasing this might happened because electrical power consumption is directly proportional to the current and time 47 however it was found that the effect of ph on y2 was found to be marginal or less when compared to other parameters 3 1 3 optimization for the present study simultaneous optimization of multi responses was done in order to find out optimized conditions for eo treatment of uric acid using doped mmo 39 optimum conditions selected for both responses were done in such a way that y1 should come out to be maximum and y2 should be minimized this optimization technique basically evaluates a point that maximizes the desirability function the optimum conditions obtained using desirability function approach were j 7 46 ma cm2 n 1 11 g l ph 3 25 and t 42 79 min along with combined desirability value d 0 880 under these conditions value for responses y1 and y2 were 97 20 and 2 588 kw h m3 respectively as suggested by bbd as shown in table 3 to validate these results further additional experiments have been performed at optimized conditions the value of the response y1 95 35 and y2 2 479 kw h m3 which was found in close agreement to the predicted values as listed in table 4 on seeing the good correlation between predicted and observed values depicts the reliability of incorporating the desirability function approach by bbd and has effectively optimized the process parameters for the eo treatment of uric acid 3 2 synergistic studies as discussed in section 2 5 synergistic studies have been performed using kinetic rate constant obtained through pseudo first order reactions the oxidation experiments of uric acid were performed with doped mmo in a batch reactor and three different techniques were applied which include photo catalysis only light source eo constant current supply only and photoelectrocatalysis constant applied current and light fig 3 shows that only 12 under solar light and 8 5 under uv degradation of uric acid were achieved through photocatalysis after 1 h in case of photoelectrocatalysis 89 5 under uv light and 96 under solar radiation degradation of uric acid were achieved within 30 min of electrolysis while eo took almost 1 h to reach that value 95 35 moreover an immense increase in the first order rate constant in case of the integrated process 0 0854 min 1 which was 3 4 times of photo catalysis 0 0025 min 1 and 1 4 times as compared to eo 0 0616 min 1 confirms the viability of dual process over single treatment processes as shown in fig 4 the synergistic effect of the dual process over eo came out to be 27 86 and over photocatalysis it was 97 07 as quantified from eq 5 while the overall synergy of the dual process was found to be 24 94 as calculated from eq 6 therefore it concludes that the dual process with synergistic results prompts it field scale applications for the wastewater treatment with a significant decrease in treatment time to further confirm our claim experimental studies were carried out using fluorescence spectroscopy for the estimation of oh production at doped mmo under different light sources fig 5 a showed that maximum oh production was found under solar radiations photoelectrocatalysis than uv and eo this might happen due to the activation of photoactive layers i e tio2 and sno2 of anode under light sources leading to the generation of more oh on the surface of anode resulting more percentage degradation of uric acid in less time some researchers have also reported that doping can improve the photoactivity of the anode by increasing the charge separation of holes and electrons 48 in order to verify the effect of ph on the generation of oh experiments were performed at different ph from the results it was found that more oh production was observed at basic ph over acidic and neutral ph fig 5b but at the same time it was also observed that in the case of basic and neutral ph generation of oh decreases with increasing time while in the case of acidic ph it was opposite hence this advocates that degradation of uric acid was found to be largely due to indirect oxidation and minutely by oh at optimized conditions 3 3 durability studies the economy of the treatment process for the pilot scale applications majorly depends upon the stability of the anode 49 thus in order to evaluate its ability to oxidize the pollutant the doped mmo anodes were used for multiple time in all extreme conditions from fig 6 it was found that despite the harsh conditions doped mmo performed significantly well even after 55 recycles 64 166 h without much substantial loss in electro oxidation process efficiency the stability of theses active doped mmo was due to the incorporation of different metal oxide combinations which not only increased its service life as well as enhanced its electrochemical activity for a longer period of time to further confirm its stability as well as to investigate the electrochemical and photochemical properties anodes were characterized through sem eds and xrd analysis as described in section 3 4 3 4 characterization of a doped mmo anode fig 7 a c shows the sem images of the ti sheet without any coating freshly coated anode and recycled anodes from the image fig 7b it was observed that thermally decomposed prepared anode exhibits a slightly rough porous smaller and shallower mud cracked type structure thus depicted anode with enhanced working area a larger active working area resulted in an increased catalytic activity which further facilitates the lowering of effective current density 50 the appearance of cracks on the fabricated anode surface depicts that the islands white bright spots are made up of different oxide layers with an average width of 5 μm 51 the presence of ti as a substrate in the anode has helped in the formation of the oxide layer of tio2 which is uv active helps in the generation of oh at the anode surface 52 addition of ta in the anode has enabled the anode to work at higher values of current without causing any damage to an anode 53 moreover the results are consistent with other reported studies that show the incorporation of sb and sn has affected the morphology by improving the structure of coatings the sem image of recycling anode fig 7c showed relatively identical surface characteristics and morphology thus confirms the uniformity of different metal oxide layer even after fifty five recycles for an elemental composition of the different metal oxides coated on anode surface freshly as well as recycled doped mmo eds was performed the stability of novel doped mmo was further proven with the presence of a predominant peak of all the five elements i e sb sn ir ta o and ti even in the recycled sheet eds data inset depicts the quantitative analysis in terms of molecular concentration of different metals in the oxide mixture which seemed almost the same in both fresh and recycle anode thus confirming the stability of anodes even after 55 recycles fig 8 a c shows x ray diffractogram xrd of a ti sheet only the freshly coated and recycled plate xrd helps to identify the existence of different metals in the oxide mixture from results it was clearly seen that the sharp peaks of tio2 with rutile phase few peaks of anatase ti along with the characteristic reflection of sno2 with rutile type structure this indicates that the mixed coating of different metals has covered the surface of the ti substrate significantly 54 despite the incorporation of doping ions into sno2 with low doping level few diffraction peaks of sb was still observed in xrd spectra 55 the peak of iro2 and ta2o5 were also confirmed from xrd spectra furthermore the same peaks of oxides of metal were observed in recycled doped mmo hence confirming the confinement of all metal oxide even after multiple runs it was observed that few metal oxide peaks were deviated from their original position due to loss of some amount of metals in the multiple runs of the experiment further details regarding the diffractions peaks have been discussed in scheme s4 56 57 3 5 mineralization studies the mineralization studies of uric acid were performed using spectrophotometric analysis fig 9 for the treated samples initially and to further confirm the degradation of uric acid some analytical test such as cod toc total available chlorine tac and inorganic ions were performed at optimized conditions fig 10 a shows the results of mineralization of uric acid in terms of reduction of cod and toc more than 90 decrement in cod and 80 reduction in toc were observed in 43 min when treatment was further continued to 70 min it was found that reduction in cod and toc became constant depicting that oxidation of uric acid into byproducts was completed production of inorganic ions such as no2 nh4 and no3 were observed after 5 min of eo treatment of uric acid as shown in fig 10b furthermore it was also observed that the concentration of nitrite ion decreased after 15 min of electrolysis while nh4 got reduced after 30 min of eo treatment in the case of no3 concentration a continuously increasing trend was observed this might be due to the oxidation of no2 and nh4 by strong oxidants such as oh hocl etc into nitrate ions as per reported in literature studies 5 fig 10c depicts the decreasing concentration of cl 1 and increasing concentration of tac because of the oxidation of cl 1 into strong oxidant species such as active chlorine hocl ocl for the electrolytic treatment of uric acid while tac is comprised of the sum of all forms of chlorine species and combined chlorine species which results from a reaction with nitrogenous organic and inorganic ions 58 during eo treatment of uric acid its removal phenomena from aqueous solution at different time intervals were investigated through ft ir spectra from fig 11 it was found that most of the peaks were got shifted distinct wave number this might be due to the structural changes occurred during the eo process some of the broad and sharp peaks during electrolysis were found disappeared due to the oxidation of uric acid and its intermediates via reactive oxidant species furthermore few peaks during electrolysis were seemed to appear which accounts for oh and chlorine species as reported in the literature 59 60 moreover the transmittance for maximum peaks was found increased after a treatment time of 55 min which indicates that the oxidation of uric acid was complete and converted into simple compounds fig 12 shows the continuous cvs for the eo treatment of uric acid of 50 mg l at platinum rod with potential range of 1 2 to 1 2 v as it can be seen that in 0 h sample untreated of uric acid one oxidation peak at 0 2 v potential in cycle 1 and one reduction peak at 0 7 v in cycle 2 were observed however in the case of the treated sample cycle 1 shows the disappearance of oxidation peak while cycle 2 exhibit a remarkable decrease in reduction peak the dissolution shifting of peaks depicts the formation of simpler oxidative and reductive species during the degradation of uric acid with a doped mmo anode 26 moreover decreased oxidation peak potential and enhanced oxidation peak current indicates the great electro catalytic activity towards the oxidation of uric acid and amplified active electrochemical surface area 25 to further examine the possible intermediates formed during eo treatment were identified through lc ms analysis on the basis of the results of lc ms analysis a possible oxidative pathway of uric acid has been proposed in fig 13 the reduction in uric acid led to the formation of intermediates 2 which further undergo through successive mechanisms such as cn bond cleavage dehydroxylation deamination etc and yield final byproducts 9 11 the final products of the oxidative pathway of uric acid have also been reported in the literature studies 5 44 the mass spectra from which the degradation pathway proposed were shown in fig s3 3 6 economic evaluation in order to visualize the successful commercialization of a process treatment technology must provide a significant reduction in the overall cost of the treatment process over conventional techniques in the case of eo treatment unit the overall economy for removal of per kg of uric acid came out to be 0 18 m3 table s2 the results depict a sustainable solution for the on site treatment of urinal wastewaters in terms of economic feasibility of eo process as well as the stability of anodes however the overall cost could be reduced further during scale up studies by modifying the reactor design and operating conditions accordingly 4 conclusion the present study depicts the successful applicability of novel fabricated doped mmo for the eo treatment of target compound that is uric acid parametric optimization for the treatment process was done using bbd in which the desirability function approach found suitable for simultaneous minimization of energy consumption and maximization of degradation the degradation of uric acid was found maximum due to the generation of strong oxidants like hocl ocl oh during electrolysis the dual effect of two processes has shown the synergistic effect on the degradation of uric acid as better degradation was achieved in lesser time characterization techniques like sem eds and xrd have proved the durability and stability of doped mmo in terms of significant degradation of uric acid even after 55 recycles uv vis ftir and lc ms analysis were used for the detection of intermediates formed during the treatment process at different time intervals furthermore future investigations would emphasize more techno economic analysis of field scale applications such as on site treatment of urinal wastewater and reuse as flush water appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online version at doi https doi org 10
