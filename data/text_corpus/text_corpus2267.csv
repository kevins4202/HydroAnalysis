so we conducted soil column leaching and soil incubation experiments with different doses of such residue sludge was obtained through thermal dryer or bed drying processes the results showed that the application of the studied residues did not cause improvement in the release of evaluated pollutants phenol no3 and cl however for chemical attributes like ph value raised from 4 5 in the blank probe to 8 7 and 7 2 in the maximum doses of thermal and bed dried sludge respectively based on ph raising critical doses for application of studied sludges were tested 11 3 t ha 1for thermal processed and 64 6 t ha 1for bed dried sludge at the critical doses for thermally dried sludge we observed improvements in effective cation exchange capacity ecec from 3 61 cmolc dm 3 in the blank probe to 6 57 cmolc dm 3 cation exchange capacity cec at ph 7 0 from 6 65 cmolc dm 3 to 7 85 cmolc dm 3 decreasing in potential acidity from 4 23 cmol dm 3 to 1 41 cmol dm 3and exchangeable aluminium was not detected since the lowest applied dose for the bed dried sludge at critical doses ecec and cec were improved to 6 64 cmolc dm 3 and 7 69 cmolc dm 3 respectively the potential acidity in the critical dose was 1 45 cmol dm 3 and exchangeable aluminium was decreased from 0 95 cmol dm 3 in the blank probe to 0 12 cmol dm 3 bases saturation and organic matter om content were also increased the effects over all the studied parameters except om were more perceptible for thermally dried sludge due to lime addition in the drying process we concluded that the application of the studied residues in agriculture is a feasible option keywords tannin coagulated sludge pollutant leaching soil chemical attributes incubation experiment soil column experiment 1 introduction land application of biosolids

kabirinejad and hoodaji 2012 zuba junio et al 2015 several studies have been conducted and have reported the feasibility of solid residuals for this application biosolids from a municipal wastewater treatment plant were used in banana production and the authors concluded that these can fully replace mineral fertilization for nitrogen and phosphorus supply teixeira et al 2011 junio et al 2015 concluded that sewage sludge compost caused changes in soil chemical properties with enhancement of organic matter om and cation exchange capacity cec similarly kabirinejad and hoodaji 2012 concluded that both sewage sludge or compost of this residual improved cec ph om n p and other nutrients in the soil with respect to industrial biosolids guimarães et al 2012 evidenced an increase in effective cation exchange capacity ecec and levels of n ca mg and p these authors also observed a decrease in soil acidity after application of biosolid from the gelatin industry on the soil using industrial sewage sludge from the dairy industry machado and de barros trannin 2015 concluded that this kind of residue can be employed as a good source of nutrients mainly n and p for both annual or perennial crops they also emphasized that it is necessary to evaluate the nutritional necessities for the crop in which the residue will be applied as well as environmental safety issues economic aspects and the necessity for mineral supplementation although the application of wastewater treatment sludges as soil amender represents a good option exploiting an untapped potential authors have also pointed to risks attached to this activity such as the presence of heavy metals and organic contaminants in sludge composition that may accumulate in soil layers and travel up the food chain additionally the presence of pathogenic microorganisms has to be considered for both industrial and sanitary sludges lu et al 2012 the possibility of leaching pollutants from biosolids used as soil amenders to water bodies also needs to be taken into account pollutants that have high mobility through soil layers as nitrate present risks to the environment knowles et al 2011 lu et al 2012 machado and de barros trannin 2015 the high presence of pollutants like n and p in water bodies leads to eutrophication carvalho et al 2013 and causes risks to human health if water is used for drinking purposes who 2011 the use of inorganic coagulants in water and wastewater treatment specifically aluminium and iron salts presents some drawbacks to its value as a soil amendment due to the generation of non biodegradable sludges the presence of metals such as al and fe at certain levels in the generated sludge can causes toxicity to crops nava et al 2016 on the other hand vegetable tannin used as a coagulant for wastewater generates sludges more suitable for use as soil amender or biologic conversion due to its organic composition junior et al 2013 souza et al 2013 dairy industries produce high amounts of wastewater up to approximately 2 5 l of wastewater per litre of processed milk dvarioniene et al 2012 slavov 2017 and organic residues along their productive chain such residues are often known as biosolids due to their predominantly organic composition ghimire et al 2015 although usage of this term was initially restricted to sewage sludges us epa 1993 in fact several studies have pointed to the feasibility of the usage of industrial biosolids as a soil amendment and linked its application to the improvement in soil fertility as shown above however environmental aspects must be taken into account based on this premise the aim of this study was to examine the leaching of selected pollutants from soil amended with solid residues from a dairy industry wastewater treatment plant by conducting a soil column leaching experiment moreover we studied the impact of the application of such residue on fertility chemical attributes of the soil in soil residue incubation experiments the applied solid residues were obtained from a dissolved air flotation daf facility that uses tannin for wastewater coagulation 2 material and methods 2 1 soil samples collection and characterization the soil utilized in the experiments was an inceptisol sampled in the rio fortuna municipality brazil 28 10 0 051 s 49 07 19 22 w the sample was collected from the 0 20 cm superficial layer in a corn cultivation area with the use of a cutting blade after collection samples were manually cracked air dried and conditioned in plastic bags and an aliquot was sent for characterization the results of the chemical characterization are shown in table 1 the granulometric composition of the soil was 23 sand 41 silt and 36 clay apparent density was 1380 kg m 3 and total porosity was 39 31 2 2 obtention of sludge utilized in experiments the study was carried out at a dairy wastewater treatment plant composed of a screening step followed by an equalization tank after which the wastewater is pumped to daf equipment designed to treat 25 m3 h 1 it has a 2 5 m² surface area and is operated at a 10 m³ m 2 h 1 surface application rate the microbubbles size is about 20 25 μm diameter and maximum recirculation rate in the system is 20 the coagulation and flocculation process applies a commercial tannin based coagulant named tanfloc sl tanac brazil the tanfloc sl is extracted from acacia mearnsii de wildemann acácia negra and its commercial solution contains 25 w w of total tannin the coagulation step is performed by the coagulant application at variable concentrations according to the turbidity of the wastewater to be clarified additionally a flocculation adjuvant is applied based on a copolymer of acrylamide and sodium acrylate after daf the sludge is sent to a dewatering unit composed of a dewatering press and then on to a rotative heat dryer facility coupled to aboiler furnace burning gas output at this stage the sludge is subjected to exhaust gas temperatures 110 2 163 3 c until constant weight around 6 to 12 h in order to prevent sludge pasting on dryer walls lime is added during the drying processes towards the end dry sludge is taken out from the dryer when the moisture is 29 3 12 6 value means five replicate measurement for comparison purposes we employed sludge obtained through both the heat drying process previously explained and the drying bed process the sample for bed drying was taken from the same lot sent to heat drying after the press dewatering step bed drying was performed in september 2016 for 21 days under sunlight on a plastic film at environmental conditions and protected from rainfall water the average temperature in the region of the experiments during this time of the year was 17 3 c and average relative air humidity 84 9 after the drying processes two aliquots one from each kind of sludge were characterized along the parameters shown in table 2 2 3 soil column leaching experiment the apparatus for the soil column leaching experiments was constructed according to skoronski et al 2017 with some modifications our study was carried out in 0 5 m length columns and the leaching period was 12 h this duration was selected because we aimed to evaluate only the promptly leachable selected pollutants from the residue soil mixture in this experiment we employed real rainwater from the municipality of rio fortuna brazil the volume of rainwater applied to columns was fixed based on the last ten years average amounts of rainfall which was 1910 mm from 1720 40 to 2099 60 mm in a 95 confidence level interval representative to the area in which the sludge was studied to be employed as a soilamendment the rainwater presented ph values ranging from 7 39 to 7 76 and electrical conductivity ranging from 72 67 to 92 66 μs at a 95 confidence level interval the unit of volume employed to control the process was the column pore volume with this in mind the total amount of water applied over the columns was 9 71 pore volumes the experiment was composed of seven treatments in triplicates three doses of each kind of sludge 15 30 and 60 t ha 1 plus a blank probe assembled only with soil and distilled water without any sludge application totaling 21 experimental units aliquots of leachate from columns were taken along the leaching time and represent the extracts from 0 to 1 1 1 5 1 5 2 5 2 5 4 5 4 5 7 0 and 7 0 9 8 which were subjected to analysis of chemical species of interest that is total phenols method 5530 c no3 method 4500 no3 b and cl method 4500 cl b according to official recognized methods apha 2012 readings were performed in a specroquant pharo 300 these chemical species were selected based on a previous environmental characterization of sludge toxicity and chemical solubilizing characters this characterization showed the presence of such compounds at levels presenting risks to human health and the environment in the thermally dried sludge utilization of two kinds of drying processes for the obtention of sludge used in this study is justified due to the possible formation of phenol and no3 being linked to the thermal drying process mean results for each assayed chemical species were compared in a 95 confidence level interval to the drinking water standards internationally established for no3 and cl who 2011 and total phenols us epa 2012 2 4 effects of applying crescent doses of studied sludges on soil chemical attributes the evaluation of the effects of applying crescent doses of the studied sludges on the chemical attributes of the soil was done through a soil sludge incubation experiment for the construction of experimental units we utilized plastic bags with the volume of 0 5 l of soil soil quantity measurement was done with a balance based on soil virtual density and considering its natural moisture 7 7 experimental plots were constructed with doses of 10 20 40 and 80 t ha 1of each kind of sludge dried basis plus a blank probe without any sludge application the experiment was conducted in triplicate totaling 27 experimental units after weighing soil parcels and sludge doses these were well mixed with a spatula and moistened to 60 70 of soil water holding capacity with distilled water taking into account the previously existent humidity in soil samples these mixtures were sealed off and incubated in the plastic bags for a period of 60 days in the dark at room temperature and with no control of air humidity average relative air humidity is 84 9 every two days plastic bags were opened for soil gases exchanges for a period of 15 min the parcels were weighed once a week and water losses were compensated with the addition of distilled water via a plastic wash bottle the chemical attributes of the soil studied were ph 1 1 in water exchangeable aluminium potential acidity ecec cec at ph 7 0 om and base saturation of cec at ph 7 0 for measurement of ph we employed a bench ph meter dakton 2700 for om an sp 1105 spectrophotometer bel for k a dm 62 flame photometer digimed and for ca and mg an aanalyst 200 atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkin elmer statistical analysis was done following a 2 5 factorial design in which one of the factors had two levels type of sludge and the other factor had five levels applied doses additionally we conducted a regression analysis relating response in the chemical attributes of soil to the applied doses mean comparisons were done by tukey test p 0 05 3 results and discussion as in the previous studies cited above this study showed the feasibility of applying industrial wastewater solid residues for agricultural purposes however it is imperative to evaluate on a case by case basis the potential for the release of pollutant species that can cause damage to the environment or to human life the viability of the use of such residues is also enhanced by its potential to improve soil fertility attributes with this premise in mind it is possible to balance the possible risks and benefits of its application 3 1 leaching column experiment the leaching column experiment was conducted over a 12 h leaching period in order to evaluate only the promptly leachable studied pollutants the microbiological activity could lead to an increase in the case of no3 or a decrease in the case of phenol in the amounts of such contaminants in the column in longer leaching periods for soil amendment purposes it is necessary to take into accountthe pre existing no3 in the sludge and the n mineralization rates along time when calculating the dosage rates this is required due to the necessity for providing sufficient n levels for crop growth and for not losing no3 through leaching in soil due to mineralization of om or the excess of pre existing mineral n us epa 1993 results for total phenol leaching is shown in fig 1 presence of phenol over the safe levels for human consumption can cause damage to liver kidneys pancreas etc due to its high toxicity moreover it presents a tendency for bioaccumulation through the food chain adhikari et al 2014 with respect to water contamination by phenol it is known that phenol presents high mobility through soil layers making it difficult for it to be biodegraded due to the short retention time caused by the negative charge in its chemical structure that repels clay minerals negative surface charged sites adhikari et al 2014 smith et al 1999 results presented in fig 1 showed no great difference among the different doses and the blank probe presence of phenol in the blank probe has also been shown in other studies such as that conducted by yager et al 2014 these authors evidenced the presence of phenol in an agricultural area before application of any kind of biosolid and argued that its presence can derive from both natural and anthropogenic sources in fact the decay of organic matter from animals and plants leads to the generation of humic substances rich in oxygenated functional groups such as carboxyl alcohol ether ester and phenols around 4 2 of total carbon present in humic acid in soil is phenolic carbon grinhut et al 2007 soil utilized in this experiment comes from an area of grain cultivation and is regularly fertilized with bovine manure combined with mineral fertilization which enhances the amount of organic matter present in the soil the method employed for the determination of total phenol in this study is based on the reaction of phenol groups with 4 aminoantipyrine expressed as total phenols however this does not mean that they are specifically the phenol compound c6h6o apha 2012 in any case none of the doses employed in the experiment reached the safe limit for phenol consumption in drinking water which is 2 0 p p m us epa 2012 we also observed that higher amounts of phenolic compounds were occasionally not leached in the firsts pore volumes this may be due to the plume of contamination of phenol not accompanying the water flow perhaps due to the interaction of phenolic compounds with the soil particles or organic matter present in the soil or to random errors considering the fact that we had high standard deviations represented by the vertical bars in fig 1 fig 2 shows the results obtained for cl chlorine is a natural component of soil subjected to a biogeochemical cycle that turns it onto organochlorinated compounds or inorganic cl its main source in soil is the deposition in the form of cl from evaporated sea water öberg 1998 the anthropogenic activity also contributes to rising cl occurrence in the soil due to fertilization practices in agricultural areas when the studied soil comes from an agricultural area this can play an important role in the occurrence of cl in the soil evidenced by the leaching products in the control probe cl has high mobility through soil layers as evidenced by veizaga et al 2015 who observed that the concentration of cl increased along the soil in an area of cattle breeding subjected to high amounts of urine and manure came from cattle dynamics for its distribution along soil the profile during the rainy season is given by leaching through soil layers and in the dry season by evapotranspiration which enhances cl concentration on top layers of soil öberg 1998 the increase in the concentration of cl in water to over 250 p p m makes water unviable for aquatic life and also modifies water taste presence of cl in drinking water can be linked to the occurrence of sodium which if consumed at high levels causes damage to human health kincaid and findlay 2009 the presence of cl in the studied residue came from the employment of sodium and calcium in the process of cheese making however although presenting a limit for water consumption cl is a secondary standard for drinking water being linked to organoleptic concerns us epa 2012 who 2011 besides the water consumption factors attached to the presence of cl the increase in salinity of the soil has environmental implications the presence of cl can increase the mobility of some heavy metals in soil such as cd and pb due to the formation of metal cl complexes and competition for the absorption sites in soil minerals particles caused by salt cations raising its availability for plant absorption and running off for water bodies acosta et al 2011 dahlin et al 2016 the mean concentration for both the two studied sludges did not reach the settled limit for drinking water which is 250 p p m who 2011 we observed that not all cl had been leached out from columns when we applied any dosage of the sludges there are reports that point to some sorption mechanisms of cl in the soil although it is commonly considered to move along soil layers without any retention kincaid and findlay 2009 it may also be due to the very high rainwater application rate the equivalent of one year of precipitation in 12 h which did not allow the effective contact between solute and solvent for a time period sufficient to its leaching in this way the plume of contamination did not follow the water flow along the columns this second possibility is reinforced if we note that in the blank probe the extracts from 4 5th pore volume and ahead did not present any amount of cl fig 3 shows the results for no3 leaching from soil columns no3 is the final oxidized form of nitrogen along its mineralization process from organic matter which passes through a reduced form the ammonium ion these two forms of nitrogen nh4 and no3 are water soluble however nh4 presents less mobility along the soil profile compared to no3 due to its interaction with negatively charged sites on soil particles nevertheless microbiological action promptly converts nh4 into no3 under favourable conditions zarabi and jalali 2012 several studies have demonstrated the high mobility of no3 through soil layers delin and stenberg 2014 köhler et al 2006 zarabi and jalali 2012 and although being an essential nutrient for growing plants linked contamination of groundwater to agricultural practices that employs nitrogenous fertilizers delin and stenberg 2014 köhler et al 2006 who 2011 zarabi and jalali 2012 even when coming from organic matter mineralization it can cause serious damage to groundwater mainly in sandy soils köhler et al 2006 presence of no3 in drinking water is limited by the world health organization to 50 p p m or 11 p p m of n no3 this restricted level is due mainly to the occurrence of methemoglobin in children cancer in the gastric system and inhibition of iodine absorption among other conditions who 2011 moreover its release into water bodies can cause its eutrophication our results are characteristic for this kind of pollutant that is highly water soluble with concentration peaks in first pore volumes and decay along the leaching process although with high variations however after leaching of several pore volumes we still observed nitrate concentrationover the settled limits for human health safety in contrast to cl which was almost all leached in the first pore volumes among all the treatments all of them presented leaching of the studied pollutant over the safe limit for drinking water 3 2 effects of the incubation of the residue in soil parcels effects of the incubation of residues in the soil are summarized in fig 4 the regression equations are indicated in table 3 sludge from heat drying process had a greater influence on soil ph after the incubation period this is due to the addition of lime during the drying process bed dried sludge also increased ph values but to a lesser extent this shows that both drying processes are able to generate sludge with potential for neutralizing soil acidity most plants grow well in a ph interval from 6 0 to 7 0 not because of the ph value itself but because nutrient availability is a ph dependent factor fao 2006 following this premise regression analysis showed that ph 7 0 was reached with the dose of 11 3 t ha 1 for heat dried sludge and 64 6 t ha 1for bed dried sludge going forward these will be considered critical doses of such residues analysis of the factorial experiment showed a significant interaction effect between the studied factors p 0 05 and the fact that heat dried sludge presented higher ph values for all the applied doses other authors have pointed out the potential of different solid wastes in soil acidity neutralizing guimarães et al 2012 showed that sludge from the gelatin industry presented potential for soil neutralizing however they also demonstrated that the extent of ph changing is linked not only to residue features but also to soil cec which indicates its buffering potential that is the higher the cec at ph 7 0 the higher the buffering potential kabirinejad and hoodaji 2012 observed the same potential with an increment of soil ph with the application of sewage sludge to soil parcels in greenhouse conditions on the other hand rezig et al 2012 observed that application of sewage sludge in a two years field experiment decreased soil ph from 8 37 to 7 40 in the dose of 10 t ha 1 compared to the control area these results demonstrate the importance of studying on a case by case basis the possibilities for using solid waste for agricultural purposes as the soil properties will change depending on its composition increase in ph had an effect on both exchangeable al3 and potential acidity both the two chemical attributes were decreased by application of the studied residue heat dried sludge presented a greater effect on this attribute for heat dried sludge we did not observe exchangeable al3 after the lowest applied dosage 10 t ha 1 for bed dried sludge considering the fitting analysis and the established critical dosage of 64 6 t ha 1 reduction of exchangeable al3 ranged from 0 95 cmolal 3 dm3 in the blank probe to 0 12cmolal 3 dm3 the decrease in exchangeable al3 by the ph increase is due to al3 precipitation under al oh 3 at ph over 5 5 guimarães et al 2012 this author observed as did we a decrease in exchangeable al3 when applying sludge with alkaline characteristics from the gelatin industry potential acidity expressed as the total sum of both al3 and h ions in the soil was decreased by application of both the two studied sludges with higher effects being observed for heat dried sludge this showed that this residue has more potential for neutralizing hydrogen ions adsorbed on soil negatively charged particles considering the fitting analysis and the critical doses heat dried sludge decreased potential acidity from 4 23cmolal 3 h dm3 in blank probe to 1 41 cmolal 3 h dm3 at 11 3 t ha 1 bed dried sludge decreased potential acidity to 1 45 cmolal 3 h dm3 statistical analysis showed significant interaction effects between the studied factors p 0 05 for decreasing potential acidity and that for all doses heat dried sludge presented smaller values for potential acidity both ecec and cec at ph 7 0 were more influenced by heat dried sludge for both the two parameters we observed the interaction between the studied factors and the values observed for heat dried sludge were higher than those observed for bed dried sludge in all of the applied doses p 0 05 however the behaviour of the cec increase was not the same for both the sludges bed dried sludge raised ecec and cec at ph 7 0 in a linear form although the point 10 t ha 1of bed dried sludge was not considered in the fitting analysis for a better fit adjust heat dried sludge presented an exponential behaviour for ecec and quadratic behaviour for cec at ph 7 0 in the studied doses interval considering the critical dosages in the function of ph raising bed dried sludge raised ecec from 3 61cmolc dm 3 to 6 64cmolc dm 3 whereas heat dried sludge raised ecec to 6 57cmolc dm 3 with respect to cec at ph 7 0 bed dried sludge raised from 6 65cmolc dm 3 for 7 69cmolc dm 3 and heat dried sludge for 7 85cmolc dm 3 rezig et al 2012 observed in a two year field experiment enhancement of ecec from 19 15cmolc dm 3 to 30 45cmolc dm 3 with the application of sewage sludge in the top 0 20 cm layer with a dose of 10 t ha 1 kabirinejad and hoodaji 2012 also observed an increase in ecec from 15 8cmolc dm 3to 18 3cmolc dm 3 in a dose of 50 t ha 1 in greenhouse conditions with sewage sludge in our study the higher effects observed for heat dried sludge is due to the addition of lime during the drying process which raises the ca and mg availability for exchange with the extraction solution base saturation presented higher values for heat dried sludge with values near 90 already at the lower doses like 20 t ha 1 meaning that almost all negative sites of soil are occupied with basic cations as described above sludge in which we added lime heat dried presented the higher potential for neutralizing the acidity of the soil due to the formation of a hydroxide of ca and mg when in contact to soil humidity formation of such hydroxides allows the neutralizing of both al3 with precipitation of al oh 3 and h ions that remains adsorbed on soil particles once these two species are neutralized all of the negative sites become available for adsorption of basic cations present in the added residue since bed dried sludge presented the lower potential for acidity neutralizing base saturation for this residue was lower when compared to the heat dried residue results analysis of the obtained results once more showed significant interaction effects between the studied factors p 0 05 in all the studied doses heat dried sludge had higher bases saturation for om in contrast to the other parameters we studied we did not observe significant interaction effects between the studied factors p 0 05 however the main effect of the factors presented a statistical difference p 0 05 in which bed dried sludge presented higher value for om the explanation for this difference is the fact that no lime was added to bed dried sludge which makes its organic content higher than for the lime added sludge heat dried similarly the analysis of the factor dosage showed that the dose 80 t ha 1presented a higher content of om all the other studied dosages did not present significant difference for om content 4 conclusion sludge from dairy wastewater treatment using tannin as coagulant did not cause an increment in leaching of the studied pollutants additionally the critical dosages for both the two studied sludges in function of ph increasing were 11 3 t ha 1 for thermally dried sludge and 64 6 t ha 1 for bed dried sludge furthermore the thermally dried sludge presented the higher potential for acidity neutralizing and cec and bases saturation increases compared to sludge obtained by bed drying additionally the bed dried sludge caused the higher addition of om content to the soil these effects were attributed to the addition of lime during the heat drying process overall the application of this residue for agricultural purposes is a good option due to its good potential for acidity neutralizing and the non release of the studied pollutants in high levels to the environment nevertheless new studies need to be conducted to assess the viability of the application of such residues for soil amendment these would have to involve field studies on the extent to which the microbiological features of soil are affected by the application of this residue and how this application influences in the growth of crops 
11335,the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of soil amendment with tannin coagulated dairy industry sludge on fertility chemical attributes and on the release of selected pollutants to do so we conducted soil column leaching and soil incubation experiments with different doses of such residue sludge was obtained through thermal dryer or bed drying processes the results showed that the application of the studied residues did not cause improvement in the release of evaluated pollutants phenol no3 and cl however for chemical attributes like ph value raised from 4 5 in the blank probe to 8 7 and 7 2 in the maximum doses of thermal and bed dried sludge respectively based on ph raising critical doses for application of studied sludges were tested 11 3 t ha 1for thermal processed and 64 6 t ha 1for bed dried sludge at the critical doses for thermally dried sludge we observed improvements in effective cation exchange capacity ecec from 3 61 cmolc dm 3 in the blank probe to 6 57 cmolc dm 3 cation exchange capacity cec at ph 7 0 from 6 65 cmolc dm 3 to 7 85 cmolc dm 3 decreasing in potential acidity from 4 23 cmol dm 3 to 1 41 cmol dm 3and exchangeable aluminium was not detected since the lowest applied dose for the bed dried sludge at critical doses ecec and cec were improved to 6 64 cmolc dm 3 and 7 69 cmolc dm 3 respectively the potential acidity in the critical dose was 1 45 cmol dm 3 and exchangeable aluminium was decreased from 0 95 cmol dm 3 in the blank probe to 0 12 cmol dm 3 bases saturation and organic matter om content were also increased the effects over all the studied parameters except om were more perceptible for thermally dried sludge due to lime addition in the drying process we concluded that the application of the studied residues in agriculture is a feasible option keywords tannin coagulated sludge pollutant leaching soil chemical attributes incubation experiment soil column experiment 1 introduction land application of biosolids

the chemical characterization are shown in table 1 the granulometric composition of the soil was 23 sand 41 silt and 36 clay apparent density was 1380 kg m 3 and total porosity was 39 31 2 2 obtention of sludge utilized in experiments the study was carried out at a dairy wastewater treatment plant composed of a screening step followed by an equalization tank after which the wastewater is pumped to daf equipment designed to treat 25 m3 h 1 it has a 2 5 m² surface area and is operated at a 10 m³ m 2 h 1 surface application rate the microbubbles size is about 20 25 μm diameter and maximum recirculation rate in the system is 20 the coagulation and flocculation process applies a commercial tannin based coagulant named tanfloc sl tanac brazil the tanfloc sl is extracted from acacia mearnsii de wildemann acácia negra and its commercial solution contains 25 w w of total tannin the coagulation step is performed by the coagulant application at variable concentrations according to the turbidity of the wastewater to be clarified additionally a flocculation adjuvant is applied based on a copolymer of acrylamide and sodium acrylate after daf the sludge is sent to a dewatering unit composed of a dewatering press and then on to a rotative heat dryer facility coupled to aboiler furnace burning gas output at this stage the sludge is subjected to exhaust gas temperatures 110 2 163 3 c until constant weight around 6 to 12 h in order to prevent sludge pasting on dryer walls lime is added during the drying processes towards the end dry sludge is taken out from the dryer when the moisture is 29 3 12 6 value means five replicate measurement for comparison purposes we employed sludge obtained through both the heat drying process previously explained and the drying bed process the sample for bed drying was taken from the same lot sent to heat drying after the press dewatering step bed drying was performed in september 2016 for 21 days under sunlight on a plastic film at environmental conditions and protected from rainfall water the average temperature in the region of the experiments during this time of the year was 17 3 c and average relative air humidity 84 9 after the drying processes two aliquots one from each kind of sludge were characterized along the parameters shown in table 2 2 3 soil column leaching experiment the apparatus for the soil column leaching experiments was constructed according to skoronski et al 2017 with some modifications our study was carried out in 0 5 m length columns and the leaching period was 12 h this duration was selected because we aimed to evaluate only the promptly leachable selected pollutants from the residue soil mixture in this experiment we employed real rainwater from the municipality of rio fortuna brazil the volume of rainwater applied to columns was fixed based on the last ten years average amounts of rainfall which was 1910 mm from 1720 40 to 2099 60 mm in a 95 confidence level interval representative to the area in which the sludge was studied to be employed as a soilamendment the rainwater presented ph values ranging from 7 39 to 7 76 and electrical conductivity ranging from 72 67 to 92 66 μs at a 95 confidence level interval the unit of volume employed to control the process was the column pore volume with this in mind the total amount of water applied over the columns was 9 71 pore volumes the experiment was composed of seven treatments in triplicates three doses of each kind of sludge 15 30 and 60 t ha 1 plus a blank probe assembled only with soil and distilled water without any sludge application totaling 21 experimental units aliquots of leachate from columns were taken along the leaching time and represent the extracts from 0 to 1 1 1 5 1 5 2 5 2 5 4 5 4 5 7 0 and 7 0 9 8 which were subjected to analysis of chemical species of interest that is total phenols method 5530 c no3 method 4500 no3 b and cl method 4500 cl b according to official recognized methods apha 2012 readings were performed in a specroquant pharo 300 these chemical species were selected based on a previous environmental characterization of sludge toxicity and chemical solubilizing characters this characterization showed the presence of such compounds at levels presenting risks to human health and the environment in the thermally dried sludge utilization of two kinds of drying processes for the obtention of sludge used in this study is justified due to the possible formation of phenol and no3 being linked to the thermal drying process mean results for each assayed chemical species were compared in a 95 confidence level interval to the drinking water standards internationally established for no3 and cl who 2011 and total phenols us epa 2012 2 4 effects of applying crescent doses of studied sludges on soil chemical attributes the evaluation of the effects of applying crescent doses of the studied sludges on the chemical attributes of the soil was done through a soil sludge incubation experiment for the construction of experimental units we utilized plastic bags with the volume of 0 5 l of soil soil quantity measurement was done with a balance based on soil virtual density and considering its natural moisture 7 7 experimental plots were constructed with doses of 10 20 40 and 80 t ha 1of each kind of sludge dried basis plus a blank probe without any sludge application the experiment was conducted in triplicate totaling 27 experimental units after weighing soil parcels and sludge doses these were well mixed with a spatula and moistened to 60 70 of soil water holding capacity with distilled water taking into account the previously existent humidity in soil samples these mixtures were sealed off and incubated in the plastic bags for a period of 60 days in the dark at room temperature and with no control of air humidity average relative air humidity is 84 9 every two days plastic bags were opened for soil gases exchanges for a period of 15 min the parcels were weighed once a week and water losses were compensated with the addition of distilled water via a plastic wash bottle the chemical attributes of the soil studied were ph 1 1 in water exchangeable aluminium potential acidity ecec cec at ph 7 0 om and base saturation of cec at ph 7 0 for measurement of ph we employed a bench ph meter dakton 2700 for om an sp 1105 spectrophotometer bel for k a dm 62 flame photometer digimed and for ca and mg an aanalyst 200 atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkin elmer statistical analysis was done following a 2 5 factorial design in which one of the factors had two levels type of sludge and the other factor had five levels applied doses additionally we conducted a regression analysis relating response in the chemical attributes of soil to the applied doses mean comparisons were done by tukey test p 0 05 3 results and discussion as in the previous studies cited above this study showed the feasibility of applying industrial wastewater solid residues for agricultural purposes however it is imperative to evaluate on a case by case basis the potential for the release of pollutant species that can cause damage to the environment or to human life the viability of the use of such residues is also enhanced by its potential to improve soil fertility attributes with this premise in mind it is possible to balance the possible risks and benefits of its application 3 1 leaching column experiment the leaching column experiment was conducted over a 12 h leaching period in order to evaluate only the promptly leachable studied pollutants the microbiological activity could lead to an increase in the case of no3 or a decrease in the case of phenol in the amounts of such contaminants in the column in longer leaching periods for soil amendment purposes it is necessary to take into accountthe pre existing no3 in the sludge and the n mineralization rates along time when calculating the dosage rates this is required due to the necessity for providing sufficient n levels for crop growth and for not losing no3 through leaching in soil due to mineralization of om or the excess of pre existing mineral n us epa 1993 results for total phenol leaching is shown in fig 1 presence of phenol over the safe levels for human consumption can cause damage to liver kidneys pancreas etc due to its high toxicity moreover it presents a tendency for bioaccumulation through the food chain adhikari et al 2014 with respect to water contamination by phenol it is known that phenol presents high mobility through soil layers making it difficult for it to be biodegraded due to the short retention time caused by the negative charge in its chemical structure that repels clay minerals negative surface charged sites adhikari et al 2014 smith et al 1999 results presented in fig 1 showed no great difference among the different doses and the blank probe presence of phenol in the blank probe has also been shown in other studies such as that conducted by yager et al 2014 these authors evidenced the presence of phenol in an agricultural area before application of any kind of biosolid and argued that its presence can derive from both natural and anthropogenic sources in fact the decay of organic matter from animals and plants leads to the generation of humic substances rich in oxygenated functional groups such as carboxyl alcohol ether ester and phenols around 4 2 of total carbon present in humic acid in soil is phenolic carbon grinhut et al 2007 soil utilized in this experiment comes from an area of grain cultivation and is regularly fertilized with bovine manure combined with mineral fertilization which enhances the amount of organic matter present in the soil the method employed for the determination of total phenol in this study is based on the reaction of phenol groups with 4 aminoantipyrine expressed as total phenols however this does not mean that they are specifically the phenol compound c6h6o apha 2012 in any case none of the doses employed in the experiment reached the safe limit for phenol consumption in drinking water which is 2 0 p p m us epa 2012 we also observed that higher amounts of phenolic compounds were occasionally not leached in the firsts pore volumes this may be due to the plume of contamination of phenol not accompanying the water flow perhaps due to the interaction of phenolic compounds with the soil particles or organic matter present in the soil or to random errors considering the fact that we had high standard deviations represented by the vertical bars in fig 1 fig 2 shows the results obtained for cl chlorine is a natural component of soil subjected to a biogeochemical cycle that turns it onto organochlorinated compounds or inorganic cl its main source in soil is the deposition in the form of cl from evaporated sea water öberg 1998 the anthropogenic activity also contributes to rising cl occurrence in the soil due to fertilization practices in agricultural areas when the studied soil comes from an agricultural area this can play an important role in the occurrence of cl in the soil evidenced by the leaching products in the control probe cl has high mobility through soil layers as evidenced by veizaga et al 2015 who observed that the concentration of cl increased along the soil in an area of cattle breeding subjected to high amounts of urine and manure came from cattle dynamics for its distribution along soil the profile during the rainy season is given by leaching through soil layers and in the dry season by evapotranspiration which enhances cl concentration on top layers of soil öberg 1998 the increase in the concentration of cl in water to over 250 p p m makes water unviable for aquatic life and also modifies water taste presence of cl in drinking water can be linked to the occurrence of sodium which if consumed at high levels causes damage to human health kincaid and findlay 2009 the presence of cl in the studied residue came from the employment of sodium and calcium in the process of cheese making however although presenting a limit for water consumption cl is a secondary standard for drinking water being linked to organoleptic concerns us epa 2012 who 2011 besides the water consumption factors attached to the presence of cl the increase in salinity of the soil has environmental implications the presence of cl can increase the mobility of some heavy metals in soil such as cd and pb due to the formation of metal cl complexes and competition for the absorption sites in soil minerals particles caused by salt cations raising its availability for plant absorption and running off for water bodies acosta et al 2011 dahlin et al 2016 the mean concentration for both the two studied sludges did not reach the settled limit for drinking water which is 250 p p m who 2011 we observed that not all cl had been leached out from columns when we applied any dosage of the sludges there are reports that point to some sorption mechanisms of cl in the soil although it is commonly considered to move along soil layers without any retention kincaid and findlay 2009 it may also be due to the very high rainwater application rate the equivalent of one year of precipitation in 12 h which did not allow the effective contact between solute and solvent for a time period sufficient to its leaching in this way the plume of contamination did not follow the water flow along the columns this second possibility is reinforced if we note that in the blank probe the extracts from 4 5th pore volume and ahead did not present any amount of cl fig 3 shows the results for no3 leaching from soil columns no3 is the final oxidized form of nitrogen along its mineralization process from organic matter which passes through a reduced form the ammonium ion these two forms of nitrogen nh4 and no3 are water soluble however nh4 presents less mobility along the soil profile compared to no3 due to its interaction with negatively charged sites on soil particles nevertheless microbiological action promptly converts nh4 into no3 under favourable conditions zarabi and jalali 2012 several studies have demonstrated the high mobility of no3 through soil layers delin and stenberg 2014 köhler et al 2006 zarabi and jalali 2012 and although being an essential nutrient for growing plants linked contamination of groundwater to agricultural practices that employs nitrogenous fertilizers delin and stenberg 2014 köhler et al 2006 who 2011 zarabi and jalali 2012 even when coming from organic matter mineralization it can cause serious damage to groundwater mainly in sandy soils köhler et al 2006 presence of no3 in drinking water is limited by the world health organization to 50 p p m or 11 p p m of n no3 this restricted level is due mainly to the occurrence of methemoglobin in children cancer in the gastric system and inhibition of iodine absorption among other conditions who 2011 moreover its release into water bodies can cause its eutrophication our results are characteristic for this kind of pollutant that is highly water soluble with concentration peaks in first pore volumes and decay along the leaching process although with high variations however after leaching of several pore volumes we still observed nitrate concentrationover the settled limits for human health safety in contrast to cl which was almost all leached in the first pore volumes among all the treatments all of them presented leaching of the studied pollutant over the safe limit for drinking water 3 2 effects of the incubation of the residue in soil parcels effects of the incubation of residues in the soil are summarized in fig 4 the regression equations are indicated in table 3 sludge from heat drying process had a greater influence on soil ph after the incubation period this is due to the addition of lime during the drying process bed dried sludge also increased ph values but to a lesser extent this shows that both drying processes are able to generate sludge with potential for neutralizing soil acidity most plants grow well in a ph interval from 6 0 to 7 0 not because of the ph value itself but because nutrient availability is a ph dependent factor fao 2006 following this premise regression analysis showed that ph 7 0 was reached with the dose of 11 3 t ha 1 for heat dried sludge and 64 6 t ha 1for bed dried sludge going forward these will be considered critical doses of such residues analysis of the factorial experiment showed a significant interaction effect between the studied factors p 0 05 and the fact that heat dried sludge presented higher ph values for all the applied doses other authors have pointed out the potential of different solid wastes in soil acidity neutralizing guimarães et al 2012 showed that sludge from the gelatin industry presented potential for soil neutralizing however they also demonstrated that the extent of ph changing is linked not only to residue features but also to soil cec which indicates its buffering potential that is the higher the cec at ph 7 0 the higher the buffering potential kabirinejad and hoodaji 2012 observed the same potential with an increment of soil ph with the application of sewage sludge to soil parcels in greenhouse conditions on the other hand rezig et al 2012 observed that application of sewage sludge in a two years field experiment decreased soil ph from 8 37 to 7 40 in the dose of 10 t ha 1 compared to the control area these results demonstrate the importance of studying on a case by case basis the possibilities for using solid waste for agricultural purposes as the soil properties will change depending on its composition increase in ph had an effect on both exchangeable al3 and potential acidity both the two chemical attributes were decreased by application of the studied residue heat dried sludge presented a greater effect on this attribute for heat dried sludge we did not observe exchangeable al3 after the lowest applied dosage 10 t ha 1 for bed dried sludge considering the fitting analysis and the established critical dosage of 64 6 t ha 1 reduction of exchangeable al3 ranged from 0 95 cmolal 3 dm3 in the blank probe to 0 12cmolal 3 dm3 the decrease in exchangeable al3 by the ph increase is due to al3 precipitation under al oh 3 at ph over 5 5 guimarães et al 2012 this author observed as did we a decrease in exchangeable al3 when applying sludge with alkaline characteristics from the gelatin industry potential acidity expressed as the total sum of both al3 and h ions in the soil was decreased by application of both the two studied sludges with higher effects being observed for heat dried sludge this showed that this residue has more potential for neutralizing hydrogen ions adsorbed on soil negatively charged particles considering the fitting analysis and the critical doses heat dried sludge decreased potential acidity from 4 23cmolal 3 h dm3 in blank probe to 1 41 cmolal 3 h dm3 at 11 3 t ha 1 bed dried sludge decreased potential acidity to 1 45 cmolal 3 h dm3 statistical analysis showed significant interaction effects between the studied factors p 0 05 for decreasing potential acidity and that for all doses heat dried sludge presented smaller values for potential acidity both ecec and cec at ph 7 0 were more influenced by heat dried sludge for both the two parameters we observed the interaction between the studied factors and the values observed for heat dried sludge were higher than those observed for bed dried sludge in all of the applied doses p 0 05 however the behaviour of the cec increase was not the same for both the sludges bed dried sludge raised ecec and cec at ph 7 0 in a linear form although the point 10 t ha 1of bed dried sludge was not considered in the fitting analysis for a better fit adjust heat dried sludge presented an exponential behaviour for ecec and quadratic behaviour for cec at ph 7 0 in the studied doses interval considering the critical dosages in the function of ph raising bed dried sludge raised ecec from 3 61cmolc dm 3 to 6 64cmolc dm 3 whereas heat dried sludge raised ecec to 6 57cmolc dm 3 with respect to cec at ph 7 0 bed dried sludge raised from 6 65cmolc dm 3 for 7 69cmolc dm 3 and heat dried sludge for 7 85cmolc dm 3 rezig et al 2012 observed in a two year field experiment enhancement of ecec from 19 15cmolc dm 3 to 30 45cmolc dm 3 with the application of sewage sludge in the top 0 20 cm layer with a dose of 10 t ha 1 kabirinejad and hoodaji 2012 also observed an increase in ecec from 15 8cmolc dm 3to 18 3cmolc dm 3 in a dose of 50 t ha 1 in greenhouse conditions with sewage sludge in our study the higher effects observed for heat dried sludge is due to the addition of lime during the drying process which raises the ca and mg availability for exchange with the extraction solution base saturation presented higher values for heat dried sludge with values near 90 already at the lower doses like 20 t ha 1 meaning that almost all negative sites of soil are occupied with basic cations as described above sludge in which we added lime heat dried presented the higher potential for neutralizing the acidity of the soil due to the formation of a hydroxide of ca and mg when in contact to soil humidity formation of such hydroxides allows the neutralizing of both al3 with precipitation of al oh 3 and h ions that remains adsorbed on soil particles once these two species are neutralized all of the negative sites become available for adsorption of basic cations present in the added residue since bed dried sludge presented the lower potential for acidity neutralizing base saturation for this residue was lower when compared to the heat dried residue results analysis of the obtained results once more showed significant interaction effects between the studied factors p 0 05 in all the studied doses heat dried sludge had higher bases saturation for om in contrast to the other parameters we studied we did not observe significant interaction effects between the studied factors p 0 05 however the main effect of the factors presented a statistical difference p 0 05 in which bed dried sludge presented higher value for om the explanation for this difference is the fact that no lime was added to bed dried sludge which makes its organic content higher than for the lime added sludge heat dried similarly the analysis of the factor dosage showed that the dose 80 t ha 1presented a higher content of om all the other studied dosages did not present significant difference for om content 4 conclusion sludge from dairy wastewater treatment using tannin as coagulant did not cause an increment in leaching of the studied pollutants additionally the critical dosages for both the two studied sludges in function of ph increasing were 11 3 t ha 1 for thermally dried sludge and 64 6 t ha 1 for bed dried sludge furthermore the thermally dried sludge presented the higher potential for acidity neutralizing and cec and bases saturation increases compared to sludge obtained by bed drying additionally the bed dried sludge caused the higher addition of om content to the soil these effects were attributed to the addition of lime during the heat drying process overall the application of this residue for agricultural purposes is a good option due to its good potential for acidity neutralizing and the non release of the studied pollutants in high levels to the environment nevertheless new studies need to be conducted to assess the viability of the application of such residues for soil amendment these would have to involve field studies on the extent to which the microbiological features of soil are affected by the application of this residue and how this application influences in the growth of crops 
11336,a field trial consisting of cotton grown employing a combination of ridge planting mulching with film and drip irrigation was laid out on a plot with severely saline soil in a typical inland arid area of xinjiang the effect of five levels of soil matric potential set up 0 2 m below the drip emitter namely 5 kpa 10 kpa 15 kpa 20 kpa and 25 kpa were studied in terms of changes in soil salinity ece sodicity sar crop growth and yield components drip irrigation increased the leaching of soil salts and decreased the ece and sar of each soil layer although the levels of soil salt rose again in spring and winter after irrigation was discontinued the root zone 0 40 cm remained less saline the ece and sar value under the soil matric potential of 5 kpa and 10 kpa were 63 and 49 of its values in 2009 respectively before the land was brought under cultivation p 0 05 showing maximum leaching the yield of cotton peaked at the soil matric potential of 5 kpa the germination rate which was the main factor that influenced the cotton yield was 67 of that in non saline soil in the first two years and increased to 84 in the third year after three years the rate of germination in all the treatments exceeded 67 and the highest rate 78 was at 5 kpa in the same treatment boll yield was 4 40 g per plant except for germination rate and the yield of lint and seed all the yield components increased significantly p 0 05 as ece and sar decreased in 2010 and 2011 the correlation between soil salt salinity and sodicity and other components such as the number of cotton bolls per plant the average weight of a boll and lint percentage varied probably because water supply was being regulated and as a result the physicochemical properties of the soil kept changing constantly taking into account the extent of leaching crop growth and yield the lower limit for the soil matric potential should be 5 kpa at 20 cm below the dripper for the first three years during reclamation to promote cotton cultivation on the saline sodic soil of xinjiang keywords soil ece soil sar drip irrigation cotton boll number lint percentage germination rate 1 introduction saline wasteland is found all over the world and china is probably the country with the largest area of such salt affected soils various types of saline soils occur in north western northern and north eastern china and in its coastal areas zhang et al 1994 li et al 2005 the total area of salt affected soils in xinjiang the largest in the country and accounting for one third of the total is 8 5 104 km² because the region is land locked the process whereby salt residues are formed and accumulate in soil is intensive and 32 6 of the total cultivated land in xinjiang shows secondary soil salinization wang et al 1993 tian et al 1999 xinjiang is the main production area of cotton in china but soil salinization has reduced cotton production drastically resulting in losses amounting to about us 0 5 billion annually or about 8 of the total output from farming yang et al 2013 hu et al 2012 therefore measures are needed urgently to make the saline wasteland in xinjiang suitable for cultivation the most common salt affected soils in xinjiang are saline soils of electric conductivity ece 4 ds m 1 and ph 8 5 current methods of treating the soils mainly include using chemicals growing plants that are adapted to such soils and using sand as a soil amendment but these methods are expensive and take a long time to give desired results qadir et al 2001 oster and shainberg 2001 combining irrigation and drainage to remove the salt by leaching is widely practiced not only in china but also worldwide wang et al 1993 oster and jayawardane 1998 however xinjiang lies in an arid area precipitation is scanty and evaporation is intense which is why irrigation when used inappropriately for leaching salt often leads to secondary salinization moreover the high concentration of sodium in relation to other cations in saline soils usually causes aggregate dispersion and poor soil infiltration rate which may lead to waterlogging in cotton fields dodd et al 2010 therefore the traditional surface irrigation for the purpose not only requires copious quantities of water and efficient drainage but also makes leaching less effective in saline sodic soils with soluble electrical conductivity ece of more than 4 ds m and esp exchangeable sodium percentage more than 15 particles expand on contact with water thereby decreasing the porosity and water conductivity of soil resulting in a very low rate of soil infiltration white 2006 the key to exploit saline soils is to maintain a relatively high soil osmotic potential around the root zone to make the soil reasonably porous and to make the soil moisture moving downward drip irrigation allows water to be applied more frequently in small quantities and over a long time which maintains the soil matric potential smp around the root zone at higher levels to compensate for the reduced soil permeability resulting from high soil salinity and sodicity thereby facilitating the absorption of water by plant roots which is why drip irrigation is widely used in improving saline and saline sodic soils goldberg et al 1976 wang et al 2007 wan et al 2007 kang et al 2012 recently by controlling soil moisture 20 cm below the drip emitter and combining drip irrigation with planting on ridges and mulching wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 some progress has been made in improving saline and saline sodic soils sun et al 2012 demonstrated that keeping the smp at 5 kpa reduced the salt level in coastal saline soils by 64 in two years zhang et al 2014 reported that maintaining the smp beneath the dripper at 15 kpa improved the physicochemical properties and nutrient status of a saline sodic soil in ningxia xidatanbaijiang markedly and li et al 2015 used brackish water for drip irrigation in a severely saline coastal land and found that more than 50 of the plants survived when the smp was 5 kpa for the first year and 10 kpa in the second year these studies mainly focused on the response of soil salinity moisture and plant growth wang et al 2014 li et al 2016 however for the commercial cotton grown in xinjiang soil salinity and sodicity are two significant causes of the poor performance of commercial cotton a number of studies have shown the sole effect of soil salinity or sodicity on cotton growth dodd 2007 zhang et al 2017 whereas the combined effects especially on yield components under drip irrigation have received little attention hence more investigations are needed on the variation of soil growth and yield parameters of crops especially cotton grown on soils with high salinity and sodicity in xinjiang under drip irrigation during the period of saline wasteland reclamation in view of the above the present study examined the salt level salinity and sodicity at different soil layers in a severely saline soil by controlling the smp thresholds 0 2 m below the drip emitter and also analyzed its effects on the yield parameters of cotton to provide a theoretical basis for the technology of regulating water through drip irrigation and to promote cotton cultivation in the saline soils of xinjiang 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site was in the agricultural comprehensive development zone karamay city xinjiang 45 22 45 40 n 84 50 85 20 e part of the lacustrine plain on the north western rim of the junggar basin and 20 km from karamay city the elevation is 370 m the region enjoys a typical temperate continental arid desert climate the average annual precipitation is 105 3 mm whereas the annual potential evaporation is as high as 1269 mm the area is low lying the depth of the water table is 2 0 3 0 m and the soil is mostly the swamp soil from the lacustrine material and saline soil from sedimentary materials the soil at the experimental site belongs to the chloride sulfate saline soils category with 1 51 salt which places the soil in the severely saline grade according to the classification standard for saline soils in china wang et al 1993 the ion composition and the ece of a saturated soil extract taking the soil from three layers namely 0 0 4 0 4 0 8 and 0 8 1 2 m were determined in 2009 before beginning the experiment the results are shown in table 1 for soil samples obtained at the 0 4 m depth at the experimental site the ece and sodium adsorption ratio sar were 45 3 ds m and 41 mmolc l 1 0 5 respectively which far exceeded the threshold salinity and sodicity for cotton maas and hoffman 1977 abrol and bhumbla 1979 the major cation in all the three layers was na which accounted for 32 65 of the total salts the main anion was cl which accounted for 20 60 of the total the ph of the entire profile 0 120 cm at the experimental site varied from 7 4 to 7 7 the local source of irrigation was the reservoir from the western suburbs the primary source being the ertix river and the total dissolved solids tds of the water was 0 2 g l groundwater in the test area was saline with tds as high as 31 2 g l the field capacity in 0 0 4 m and 0 4 0 8 m soil depths for the experimental soil were 0 31 and 0 29 cm3 cm 3 respectively 2 2 experimental design and arrangement 2 2 1 experimental design the experiments spanned three cotton growing seasons 2009 2010 and 2011 the variety was xinluzhong 26 a common variety in the area the crop was drip irrigated and the smp of soil 0 2 m directly underneath the drip emitter was set to different levels the smp levels that triggered irrigation follow 5 kpa s1 10 kpa s2 15 kpa s3 20 kpa s4 and 25 kpa s5 the experiment was laid out in a completely randomized block design with three replications a tensiometer was installed in the second replicate to observe the matric potential of soil at a point 20 cm below the drip emitter fig 1 2 2 2 experimental arrangement the management practices for the crop consisted of ridge planting mulching with film and drip irrigation the ridges were 0 4 m wide 0 15 m high and 3 8 m long spaced 0 8 m apart each ridge had its separate drip line and accommodated two rows of cotton spaced 0 2 m apart with plants within each row spaced 0 1 m apart each plot occupying 30 4 m² consisted of 10 ridges with 10 drip lines fig 1 the crops were sown on 31 may 2009 10 may 2010 and 7 may 2011 each treatment was regulated by its own separate gravity fed drip irrigation system the flow of water being controlled with a ball valve at the bottom of a 1 0 m tall barrel with the capacity to hold 900 l the flow index of the dripper at the drip irrigation hose was 0 5 the distance between two dippers was 0 2 m and the flow rate was 0 40 0 56 l h during the experiment a compound fertilizer 16 n 35 p2o5 and 8 k2o 450 kg hm² was given by mixing it with irrigation water and 150 kg hm² of potassium fertilizer k2o was given in the form of a spray before sowing subsequently each plot was also given 0 3 l of a 30 solution of urea every 5 days the plots were mulched with a plastic film after sowing which was removed after seedling emergence initially 2 3 seeds were sown per hole at a depth of 0 03 m irrigation began after the final thinning at the four leaf stage and only one plant was left per hole to ensure that enough seedlings were available before starting the treatments all the plots were irrigated before sowing the quantity of irrigation 9 8 mm being determined based on the moisture content of the top layer the lower limit of the smp 0 2 m below the dripper was set at 10 kpa after the treatments began irrigation was controlled by the vacuum gauge readings were taken at 8 00 and 18 00 every day if the reading was lower than the lower limit irrigation was triggered immediately the total quantity of irrigation was 9 8 mm each event for all the treatments 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil sampling soil from each of the three ridges for each treatment was sampled twice a year the actual dates being 20 may and 17 september 2009 28 april and 16 september 2010 and 13 april and 14 september 2011 for each ridge the samples were collected from nine layers distributed as follows 0 0 05 0 05 0 10 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 3 0 3 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 0 8 1 0 and 1 0 1 2 m each layer was sampled at nine locations moving progressively away from the dripper horizontally up to 0 4 m in increments of 0 05 m fig 1 the samples were sealed air dried in the laboratory and ground fine enough to pass through a 1 mm sieve 2 3 2 soil water content and seasonal water consumption the soil samples for water content measurements were obtained with an auger 0 02 m in diameter and 0 15 m high in the same positions as above the water contents were measured by gravimetric method at intervals of 25 30 d during the cotton growing seasons of 2009 2011 seasonal water consumption or actual crop evapotranspiration eta mm for cotton in each treatment were estimated using a water balance approach james 1988 1 e t a i p c δ s r d where i is irrigation amount mm p is precipitation mm c is capillary rise to the root zone mm δs is the change of soil water storage mm r is surface runoff and d is percolation mm in eq 1 c was considered zero because the water table depth was 2 0 m below the ground surface runoff was assumed to be insignificant because the field was flat deep percolation was considered negligible because soil water contents swc below 0 6 m measurements were up to 1 2 m depth did not reach field capacity at any sampling time to estimate δs swc in the soil profile down to 0 8 m was determined by gravimetric measurements the variations of swc δs during the experiment were calculated using the average swc value of the soil samples 2 3 3 determination of the soil salinity and sodicity the ece of a saturated extract of soil was measured oster et al 1999 using a conductivity meter dds 11a ningbo biocotek scientific instrument co ningbo china the sar was calculated from the following equation using concentrations of the subscript cations na ca2 and mg2 in units of mmolc l 1 2 s a r c n a c c a c m g 2 1 2 concentrations of na were determined by flame photometer method and of ca2 and mg2 by edta titration method bao 2005 2 3 4 growth and physiological indicators 2 3 4 1 plant height stem diameter and leaf area in 2010 and 2011 plant height and stem diameter were recorded every 10 days for 10 plants from each replication for leaf area leaf length and width were measured in these 10 plants also every 10 days until the end of the growth period 2 3 4 2 biomass in mid september of 2010 and 2011 10 plants were selected from each replicate to determine the number of cotton bolls at the time of harvest late october and the weight dry weight of the entire plant and that of all the bolls on it were recorded 2 3 4 3 yield harvesting was done by hand the harvest lasted from early october to mid november the pickings in each plot being repeated every 7 10 days seed yield was recorded for each plot and lint percentage was recorded by ginning 1 kg of seed cotton from each plot 2 3 5 data analysis surfer ver 7 0 spss ver 16 0 and excel 2010 were used for data analysis analyses of variance were used to test the significance of treatment growing year and soil layer p 0 05 differences of treatments growing years and soil layers combinations were further evaluated by least significant difference lsd because of the different depth intervals the average value weighted average was used in the data analysis 3 weighted average σ sample content sampling depth or analytical depth 3 results 3 1 water table depth the water table depth in the experimental field during cotton growth seasons in 2010 and 2011 are presented in fig 2 the main factors likely to influence ground water are precipitation and irrigation in the area from 29 july flowering stage to 5 november after harvest in 2010 the water table rose from 3 1 to 2 7 m during winter 2010 and early spring 2011 the water table receded to 3 2 m however the water table rose from 3 1 to 2 6 m during the whole cotton growing season in 2011 and depths fluctuated more frequently than in 2010 fig 2 possibly because of more intense rainfall in 2010 moreover the large amount of flood irrigation water used in non salinized cotton fields around the experimental area may have raised the water table 3 2 soil texture and bulk density the soil texture at the experimental site was silt in each soil layer before sowing in 2009 table 2 during the three years of irrigation there were slight changes in soil texture the soil textures remained as silt in each depth 0 1 2 m but with minor changes in soil mechanical composition table 2 compared with soil texture the changes in soil bulk density sbd were more significant during the three years of reclamation for the s1 treatment sbd decreased significantly by 6 and 8 in 0 0 4 m and 0 4 0 8 m layers respectively after three years of irrigation however sbd increased for both s1 and s5 treatments in the deep layer 0 8 1 2 m compared with the initial value in 2009 although there was a slight but non significant p 0 05 decrease of sbd in the 0 0 4 m layer for the s5 treatment in 2011 3 3 irrigation and seasonal water consumption the amount of irrigation and the number of irrigations are shown in table 3 irrigation treatments were initiated on 15 june 2009 15 days after seeding 2 june 2010 22 days after seeding and 5 june 2010 27 days after seeding which corresponded to the days the seedlings were thinned in each experimental year the difference between the three years was because of the difference in the seasonal precipitation the total precipitation mm during the whole growth period was 67 3 114 6 and 70 4 respectively in 2009 2010 and 2011 the highest irrigation amount was for the s1 treatment during the whole growing season similarly the highest eta occurred in s1 treatment similarly owing to the adequate soil water supply during the growing season therefore the s1 treatment had the highest total water consumption 679 1 mm in 2009 659 6 mm in 2010 and 664 3 mm in 2011 the other treatments were subject to salt stress which resulted in lower eta the lowest eta was for the s5 treatment 25 kpa 279 8 mm in 2009 310 4 mm in 2010 and 253 2 mm in 2011 3 4 changes in ece prior to the 2009 sowing the salt content in the surface layer was high ece of 45 3 ds m table 4 far higher than the maximum of 7 7 ds m maas and hoffman 1977 at which cotton can grow in the deeper layers ece was significantly lower indicating that salt accumulated mainly at the surface 0 0 4 m in the 2009 growing season the salt was redistributed among the soil layers due to irrigation when irrigation was discontinued in september 2009 the distribution of salt showed higher values in the surface layer than in the deeper layers and salt content differed significantly among the layers by the time the irrigation was terminated the salt content of all the layers in treatments s1 and s2 was substantially lower than that before sowing in treatments s3 s4 and s5 the salt content at the surface was lower but that in the deeper layers was higher probably because the smaller quantities of irrigation in 2009 in these three treatments leached the surface salt layers where it accumulated on discontinuing irrigation the salt moved back to the soil surface as the water evaporated from late winter to early spring so that salt level in every soil layer in april 2010 was higher than in the corresponding layer in september 2009 although the salt rebound rates decreased with the decreasing soil layer the value of ece in the 0 0 4 m layers in s1 s2 and s3 continued to be lower than that in the deeper layers and surface salt levels in s4 and s5 were higher suggesting that the upward movement of salt is extensive in spring and winter and that inadequate irrigation favors salt accumulation at the surface on discontinuing the irrigation in 2010 the ece value of each soil layer decreased again indicating that soil mass in the upper layers 0 1 2 m especially that in the root zone 0 0 4 m had managed to retain its low salt status despite the upward movement of salt in spring and winter the salt content in each soil layer before sowing and after irrigation in 2011 was similar to that in 2010 the ece value in the root zone after irrigation was only 4 3 ds m in s1 and even in s5 it had dropped to 16 1 ds m a 63 reduction compared to the value in 2009 before the experiment began as to the variation in the same layers in different years the ece value in all the layers was the lowest in 2011 and significantly different from that in the other years suggesting a steady decrease in the salt level over time because of irrigation both smp and the number of years over which the plots had been irrigated affected the ece values greatly and so did the interaction between the matric potential and the number of years and that among the matric potential the number of years and depths 3 5 changes in sar the index of sar represents soil sodicity in the present study a high sar 13 is reportedly responsible for poor physical properties of the soil including restricted aeration and moisture movement singh and abrol 1985 in this study the changes in sar with time table 5 were similar as those of ece table 4 greater reductions of sar occurred in 0 0 4 m than 0 4 0 8 and 0 8 1 2 m depths after the third irrigation season the decline in sar in the 0 40 cm depth relative to the initial level ranged within 10 38 and the rates increased with increasing smp thresholds for treatments s3 s4 and s5 a reduction only occurred in 0 0 4 m depth table 5 whereas for 0 8 1 2 m the final sar was higher than the initial sar in 2009 similar to ece in spring there were significant rebounds for sar in each soil depth and the rebounds increased with decreasing smp threshold the relative reductions for sar values were smaller than for ece possibly because of the buffering of exchange capacity compared with the initial value in 2009 the values for treatments in root zone after irrigation was terminated showed continued reductions in each growing season similarly to ece the effects of smp threshold growing years and soil layers and their interactions all had significant effects on sar values table 5 by comparing the content after harvest in 2011 with initial values in 2009 the decreasing rates of four main ions cl na ca2 and mg2 within 0 0 4 m and 0 1 2 m soil depths were calculated fig 3 there were clearly greater rates of decrease for ion contents in shallow 0 0 4 m than in deep soil layers 0 1 2 m the decreasing rates of cl content in the two soil layers ranged within 58 3 94 4 and increased with increasing smp thresholds the decrease rates for na showed similar variations to cl except for rates in deep soil layers with low smp thresholds s3 s5 which ranged within 35 6 55 6 in contrast the decrease rates for ca2 and mg2 during the three years of reclamation were lower than for na and cl especially at high smp thresholds s1 and s2 after three years of irrigation the decrease rates for ca2 and mg2 in the two soil layers ranged within 25 7 66 8 and increased with increasing smp thresholds similar to those of cl and na 3 6 dynamics of cotton growth 3 6 1 plant height and leaf area index plant height exhibited an s shaped curve from the seedling to the boll stage in 2010 fig 4 a relatively slow initial growth more repaid growth in the middle of the growth period and slow growth again towards the end of the growth period however growth in 2011 did not follow that pattern because of greater precipitation 27 mm in early april and may which resulted in excessive growth of cotton during that period in 2010 the treatments involving greater quantities of irrigation s1 and s2 resulted in rapid growth whereas the shortest plants were seen in s5 over time the level of salt in the soil decreased gradually as did the differences among treatments therefore the difference in plant height among different treatments was smaller in 2011 than that in 2010 the leaf area index lai also showed a similar s shaped curve because of greater irrigation and sufficient leaching of salt in s1 and s2 the mild saline stress resulted in rapid growth whereas growth was far slower in s4 and s5 because of the severe salt stress from smaller quantities of irrigation irrigation was discontinued after the boll stage and the lai decreased because of wilting and even defoliation because of the higher precipitation during the early growth period in 2011 the pattern of changes in lai in each treatment was different from that in the corresponding treatment in 2010 namely more rapid growth at the beginning which was comparable to the rate seen in mid term in 2010 and the faster growth in s1 and s2 3 6 2 yield and yield components in the present study the following attributes were considered as cotton yield components germination percentage number of bolls per plant seed weight per boll and lint percentage table 6 prior to sowing in 2009 germination was lower than 35 in all the treatments because of high salt content in the soil all the differences between them were significant and were also seen in 2010 because of irrigation in 2009 leaching of salts from the root zone was higher in s1 and s2 which increased the germination percentage in those two treatments whereas it was relatively low in the other three treatments in 2011 germination was greatly improved and reached 67 in all the treatments with no substantial difference among them indicating that the salt had been effectively leached as a result of the previous year s irrigation late sowing high level of salt and a local storm in 2009 resulted in higher mortality of cotton seedlings in october 2009 the maturing of bolls was inhibited owing to an abrupt decrease in temperature and no yield data could be collected in that year in 2010 the number of bolls per plant differed significantly among treatments and decreased with decreasing smp in 2011 the relationship between the number of bolls per plant and the matric potential was not uniform at the matric potential higher than 20 kpa the boll number per plant increased as the reduction in smp but it decreases as the reduction in smp was lower than 20 kpa in 2010 both seed weight per boll and lint percentage differed significantly among the treatments table 6 initially up to 15 kpa seed weight increased as the matric potential increased but decreased as the potential increased beyond 15 kpa in 2011 the seed weight did not differ substantially among the treatments although it was much more than that in 2010 in all the treatments indicating that lower soil salt level had increased the weight per boll and lint percentage to some extent in 2010 the yield of lint and seed in s1 was 69 of that from a local non saline soil and went up to 86 in 2010 in both years the yields of lint and seed increased as the smp decreased 3 7 soil salt level and yield components in the present study the major factors that affected plant growth were soil moisture and salt but salt was affected mainly by irrigation tables 3 and 4 therefore regression analysis was used to study the relationship between the components of yield and soil salt salinity and sodicity soil salinity and sodicity ece and sar value towards the later stages of growth in the top 40 cm layers based on root distribution as a result of drip irrigation hanson et al 2006 hu et al 2009 was taken as the main factor influencing yield because that value was seen to have a significant effect on the growth of cotton in 2010 and 2011 germination percentage was significantly and linearly correlated with both soil ece and sar value of the root zone figs 5 and 6 suggesting that salt has a significant effect on germination percentage whereas no such correlation was seen in 2009 in 2010 the number of bolls per plant decreased with the decrease in ece and sar showing a significant linear correlation between them in 2011 however the number of bolls per plant increased initially with increase in ece and sar but began to decline as the values reached 16 ds m and 21 mmolc l 1 0 5 seed weight per boll on the other hand showed the opposite pattern an initial increase followed by a decrease as the ece and sar values increased beyond a point in 2010 and a negative linear correlation in 2011 in 2010 and 2011 although no significant linear correlation of lint percentage with both ece and sar were seen lint percentage in 2011 was significantly higher than that in 2010 indicating that a lower salt level increases lint percentage ashraf and ahmad 2000 the effects of ece and sar levels in the root zone on the yields of lint and seed were dramatic and both showed a significant linear correlation with ece and sar in 2010 and 2011 fig 7 the yield of lint and seed in 2011 was higher than that in 2010 in all the treatments with s1 and s5 showing the largest increase 25 in the case of lint and 42 in that of seed in s1 the corresponding values in s5 being and 42 and 92 fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 effect of smp thresholds on soil salt in the saline region of xinjiang stress caused by soil salinity and sodicity is the main reason for the restricted growth of cotton more frequent drip irrigation but in smaller quantities and over a longer duration maintained a higher level of smp around the dripper and leached the salt ions away from the root zone compensating to some extent for the lower soil permeability due to high salt levels and thus led to higher uptake of water in addition mulching with a film reduced surface evaporation thereby promoting the retention of soil moisture and inhibiting the upward movement of salt to the surface dou and kang 2010 used a combination of planting on ridges mulching and drip irrigation to study the regulation of soil moisture in the saline sodic soils of the pingluo region in ningxia and demonstrated that soil salt in the root zone was effectively leached away after three years of irrigation and jiao et al 2008 showed that the highest leaching and the highest crop yield were obtained when the smp was set at 5 kpa during drip irrigation in the qingtongxia region in ningxia in the present study after three years of irrigation the ece and sar of soil within the root zone at 5 kpa was only 4 3 ds m and 10 mmolc l 1 0 5 compared to 16 1 ds m and 24 mmolc l 1 0 5 at 25 kpa respectively with lower quantity of irrigation the value was reduced to 63 of that in 2009 before initiating the experiment and the soil had already turned into mildly saline soil as it did in ningxia jiao et al 2006 and as reported by wan et al 2012 indicating that the combination of ridge planting mulching and drip irrigation is particularly suitable for the saline wastelands of xinjiang li et al 2016 found that the optimal threshold of smp should be 10 kpa for a salt sensitive plant in a coastal saline region in our study more water was applied for the s1 than other treatments and leached salt from the 0 0 4 m depth in treatments with low smp thresholds s2 s5 was more prone to accumulate in 0 4 0 8 and 0 8 1 2 m soil layers moreover because of the lateral and downward movement of water and salt that occurs beneath drip emitters wang et al 2012 significant reductions occurred during each irrigation season followed by a significant rebound during winter the ratio of lateral movement to downward movement likely increased with decreasing applied water which would explain why the rebound in salinity was greater for the s2 s5 treatments than the s1 therefore the lower limit of 5 kpa for the smp at 0 2 m below the dripper can serve as a guide and should be used for 3 years before sowing the difference in the trigger target was that leaching was affected not only by the frequency and quantity of irrigation but also by the composition of salts climate and other farming practices in the present study the reductions for sar values were smaller than for ece this may be because of buffering of exchange capacity carmona et al 2010 which can also be found in the decreasing rates for the four main soil ions after three years of irrigation fig 3 the decrease rates for na and cl were much higher than for ca2 and mg2 the mutual effects of soil salinity and sodicity made leaching more difficult than the individual effect of the two qadir et al 2002 found that the h released by roots released ca from insoluble solid salts as ca² which lowered soil na because of the ion substitution effect thereby lowering the sar in such saline sodic soils and improving the physical properties of soil which was one reason for the improved soil condition after three years in the present study soil structure improved as shown by sbd table 2 especially in the shallow soil layer with high smp thresholds s1 treatment 4 2 effects of smp thresholds on cotton growth in severely saline sodic soils high salinity and sodicity is the main reason for the poor performance of cotton including osmotic stress ion toxicity ion imbalance and nutritional deficiency fisher et al 1994 of these salt stress is the main factor which inhibits photosynthesis and lowers carbon assimilation in addition the synthesis and accumulation of substances which at their normal concentrations help in osmotic adjustment and the maintenance of osmotic potential results in greater energy consumption accelerated senescence and eventual death due to carbon starvation yu and tang 1998 the saline sodic soil in this study area is of the chloride sulfate type and salt stress comes mainly from na in the present experiment treatments that involved larger quantities of irrigation namely s1 and s2 resulted in higher growth parameters whereas salt stress was more severe in the treatment that involved the lowest quantity of irrigation treatment namely s5 resulting in the shortest plants which is consistent with earlier results bassil and kaffka 2002 chen et al 2009 kang et al 2010 it was noted that high soil sodicity had no effect on the number of bolls and fruit weight but did reduce plant height of cotton dodd et al 2010 however in our study the combined effects of high salinity and sodicity had an adverse effect on cotton growth especially in the first two years when soil salts were relatively high table 6 in s1 the growth peak was delayed compared to that in the other treatments mainly because of the more copious irrigation and milder salt stress in s1 compared to other developmental stages the seedling stage is more sensitive to soil salt zhang et al 2008 dong et al 2009 in the experimental region the salt level was high in 2009 before sowing which resulted in low germination percentage 35 in all treatments after three years of irrigation it increased significantly to more than 67 in all treatments following marked improvement in the physicochemical properties of soil due to adequate leaching of salts and especially due to the marked increase in soil porosity and nutrient content wang et al 2015 4 3 correlations between soil salt and cotton yield components generally the major factors that affect plant growth in arid saline land are soil moisture and salt however in this study salt was affected mainly by irrigation tables 4 and 5 therefore we used regression analysis to investigate the relationships between cotton yield components and soil salt salinity and sodicity the results showed that the variation trends of yield components with soil salinity and sodicity were similar the number of bolls per plant decreased with the decrease in both ece and sar in the root zone and showed significant linear relationships consistent with earlier results daleshwar et al 2006 dağdelen et al 2009 however in 2011 the number of bolls per plant increased initially with both ece and sar but declined later as ece and sar reached 16 ds m and 21 mmolc l 1 0 5 respectively whereas the weight per boll showed the opposite pattern an initial increase followed by a decrease as ece and sar increased but showed a significant linear negative correlation to both soil ece and sar in 2011 probably because the gradual reduction in salt over time had changed the main factors affecting reproductive growth of cotton however given the increased plant population and the same amount of fertilizers meant that each plant had a smaller share of fertilizers under the high matric potential treatments low ece and sar value which to some extent affected the reproductive growth of cotton it was reported that in a salt affected soil the decrease in cotton yield was mainly due to reduction in boll number zhang et al 2017 in our study the main factor that affected cotton yield was probably the germination rate as the variation trends with soil salt salinity and sodicity were similar over the last two years in s5 soil salt remained the major factor affecting growth because of the relatively high soil salt levels in 2010 and 2011 differences in the extent of leaching under different smps lead to various changes in the physicochemical properties of soil such as porosity and nutrient status which affect the growth and yield of crops rasouli et al 2013 in the present study the yield of lint and seed under s1 was 69 of that in non saline soils and increased to 86 in 2011 the cotton yields were lower at lower matric potentials consistent with earlier results for other crops in the saline soils of ningxia tan and kang 2009 5 conclusion the smp thresholds affected the extent of leaching of salts significantly during the growth period of cotton soil ece and sar value decreased gradually in each soil layer although the level of salt rose again in spring and winter however soil in the root zone the first two layers namely 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m continued to be low in salt after three years of irrigation maximum leaching was observed at the smp of 5 kpa a combination of ridge planting mulching and drip irrigation to regulate the level of soil moisture and salt in saline soils with high ece and sar achieved the desired effects in the form of higher germination percentage greater reproductive growth and increased yield the higher the smp the more extensive the leaching and the better was the growth of cotton maximum yields were obtained at the smp of 5 kpa being 69 and 86 of the yields from non saline soil over 2 and 3 years respectively the decrease of cotton yield was mainly due to the reduction of germination rate in xinjiang region by examining the extent of leaching layer by layer and its effect on the growth and yield of cotton the lower limit of 5 kpa for the smp at 0 2 m below the dripper can serve as a guide for irrigating the land in the first three years before sowing cotton during the reclamation of saline wasteland of xinjiang china acknowledgement this study was supported by the fundamental research funds for the central universities no 2017pt12 no 2016zcq06 and no 2015zcq sb 03 
11336,a field trial consisting of cotton grown employing a combination of ridge planting mulching with film and drip irrigation was laid out on a plot with severely saline soil in a typical inland arid area of xinjiang the effect of five levels of soil matric potential set up 0 2 m below the drip emitter namely 5 kpa 10 kpa 15 kpa 20 kpa and 25 kpa were studied in terms of changes in soil salinity ece sodicity sar crop growth and yield components drip irrigation increased the leaching of soil salts and decreased the ece and sar of each soil layer although the levels of soil salt rose again in spring and winter after irrigation was discontinued the root zone 0 40 cm remained less saline the ece and sar value under the soil matric potential of 5 kpa and 10 kpa were 63 and 49 of its values in 2009 respectively before the land was brought under cultivation p 0 05 showing maximum leaching the yield of cotton peaked at the soil matric potential of 5 kpa the germination rate which was the main factor that influenced the cotton yield was 67 of that in non saline soil in the first two years and increased to 84 in the third year after three years the rate of germination in all the treatments exceeded 67 and the highest rate 78 was at 5 kpa in the same treatment boll yield was 4 40 g per plant except for germination rate and the yield of lint and seed all the yield components increased significantly p 0 05 as ece and sar decreased in 2010 and 2011 the correlation between soil salt salinity and sodicity and other components such as the number of cotton bolls per plant the average weight of a boll and lint percentage varied probably because water supply was being regulated and as a result the physicochemical properties of the soil kept changing constantly taking into account the extent of leaching crop growth and yield the lower limit for the soil matric potential should be 5 kpa at 20 cm below the dripper for the first three years during reclamation to promote cotton cultivation on the saline sodic soil of xinjiang keywords soil ece soil sar drip irrigation cotton boll number lint percentage germination rate 1 introduction saline wasteland is found all over the world and china is probably the country with the largest area of such salt affected soils various types of saline soils occur in north western northern and north eastern china and in its coastal areas zhang et al 1994 li et al 2005 the total area of salt affected soils in xinjiang the largest in the country and accounting for one third of the total is 8 5 104 km² because the region is land locked the process whereby salt residues are formed and accumulate in soil is intensive and 32 6 of the total cultivated land in xinjiang shows secondary soil salinization wang et al 1993 tian et al 1999 xinjiang is the main production area of cotton in china but soil salinization has reduced cotton production drastically resulting in losses amounting to about us 0 5 billion annually or about 8 of the total output from farming yang et al 2013 hu et al 2012 therefore measures are needed urgently to make the saline wasteland in xinjiang suitable for cultivation the most common salt affected soils in xinjiang are saline soils of electric conductivity ece 4 ds m 1 and ph 8 5 current methods of treating the soils mainly include using chemicals growing plants that are adapted to such soils and using sand as a soil amendment but these methods are expensive and take a long time to give desired results qadir et al 2001 oster and shainberg 2001 combining irrigation and drainage to remove the salt by leaching is widely practiced not only in china but also worldwide wang et al 1993 oster and jayawardane 1998 however xinjiang lies in an arid area precipitation is scanty and evaporation is intense which is why irrigation when used inappropriately for leaching salt often leads to secondary salinization moreover the high concentration of sodium in relation to other cations in saline soils usually causes aggregate dispersion and poor soil infiltration rate which may lead to waterlogging in cotton fields dodd et al 2010 therefore the traditional surface irrigation for the purpose not only requires copious quantities of water and efficient drainage but also makes leaching less effective in saline sodic soils with soluble electrical conductivity ece of more than 4 ds m and esp exchangeable sodium percentage more than 15 particles expand on contact with water thereby decreasing the porosity and water conductivity of soil resulting in a very low rate of soil infiltration white 2006 the key to exploit saline soils is to maintain a relatively high soil osmotic potential around the root zone to make the soil reasonably porous and to make the soil moisture moving downward drip irrigation allows water to be applied more frequently in small quantities and over a long time which maintains the soil matric potential smp around the root zone at higher levels to compensate for the reduced soil permeability resulting from high soil salinity and sodicity thereby facilitating the absorption of water by plant roots which is why drip irrigation is widely used in improving saline and saline sodic soils goldberg et al 1976 wang et al 2007 wan et al 2007 kang et al 2012 recently by controlling soil moisture 20 cm below the drip emitter and combining drip irrigation with planting on ridges and mulching wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 some progress has been made in improving saline and saline sodic soils sun et al 2012 demonstrated that keeping the smp at 5 kpa reduced the salt level in coastal saline soils by 64 in two years zhang et al 2014 reported that maintaining the smp beneath the dripper at 15 kpa improved the physicochemical properties and nutrient status of a saline sodic soil in ningxia xidatanbaijiang markedly and li et al 2015 used brackish water for drip irrigation in a severely saline coastal land and found that more than 50 of the plants survived when the smp was 5 kpa for the first year and 10 kpa in the second year these studies mainly focused on the response of soil salinity moisture and plant growth wang et al 2014 li et al 2016 however for the commercial cotton grown in xinjiang soil salinity and sodicity are two significant causes of the poor performance of commercial cotton a number of studies have shown the sole effect of soil salinity or sodicity on cotton growth dodd 2007 zhang et al 2017 whereas the combined effects especially on yield components under drip irrigation have received little attention hence more investigations are needed on the variation of soil growth and yield parameters of crops especially cotton grown on soils with high salinity and sodicity in xinjiang under drip irrigation during the period of saline wasteland reclamation in view of the above the present study examined the salt level salinity and sodicity at different soil layers in a severely saline soil by controlling the smp thresholds 0 2 m below the drip emitter and also analyzed its effects on the yield parameters of cotton to provide a theoretical basis for the technology of regulating water through drip irrigation and to promote cotton cultivation in the saline soils of xinjiang 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site was in the agricultural comprehensive development zone karamay

is 2 0 3 0 m and the soil is mostly the swamp soil from the lacustrine material and saline soil from sedimentary materials the soil at the experimental site belongs to the chloride sulfate saline soils category with 1 51 salt which places the soil in the severely saline grade according to the classification standard for saline soils in china wang et al 1993 the ion composition and the ece of a saturated soil extract taking the soil from three layers namely 0 0 4 0 4 0 8 and 0 8 1 2 m were determined in 2009 before beginning the experiment the results are shown in table 1 for soil samples obtained at the 0 4 m depth at the experimental site the ece and sodium adsorption ratio sar were 45 3 ds m and 41 mmolc l 1 0 5 respectively which far exceeded the threshold salinity and sodicity for cotton maas and hoffman 1977 abrol and bhumbla 1979 the major cation in all the three layers was na which accounted for 32 65 of the total salts the main anion was cl which accounted for 20 60 of the total the ph of the entire profile 0 120 cm at the experimental site varied from 7 4 to 7 7 the local source of irrigation was the reservoir from the western suburbs the primary source being the ertix river and the total dissolved solids tds of the water was 0 2 g l groundwater in the test area was saline with tds as high as 31 2 g l the field capacity in 0 0 4 m and 0 4 0 8 m soil depths for the experimental soil were 0 31 and 0 29 cm3 cm 3 respectively 2 2 experimental design and arrangement 2 2 1 experimental design the experiments spanned three cotton growing seasons 2009 2010 and 2011 the variety was xinluzhong 26 a common variety in the area the crop was drip irrigated and the smp of soil 0 2 m directly underneath the drip emitter was set to different levels the smp levels that triggered irrigation follow 5 kpa s1 10 kpa s2 15 kpa s3 20 kpa s4 and 25 kpa s5 the experiment was laid out in a completely randomized block design with three replications a tensiometer was installed in the second replicate to observe the matric potential of soil at a point 20 cm below the drip emitter fig 1 2 2 2 experimental arrangement the management practices for the crop consisted of ridge planting mulching with film and drip irrigation the ridges were 0 4 m wide 0 15 m high and 3 8 m long spaced 0 8 m apart each ridge had its separate drip line and accommodated two rows of cotton spaced 0 2 m apart with plants within each row spaced 0 1 m apart each plot occupying 30 4 m² consisted of 10 ridges with 10 drip lines fig 1 the crops were sown on 31 may 2009 10 may 2010 and 7 may 2011 each treatment was regulated by its own separate gravity fed drip irrigation system the flow of water being controlled with a ball valve at the bottom of a 1 0 m tall barrel with the capacity to hold 900 l the flow index of the dripper at the drip irrigation hose was 0 5 the distance between two dippers was 0 2 m and the flow rate was 0 40 0 56 l h during the experiment a compound fertilizer 16 n 35 p2o5 and 8 k2o 450 kg hm² was given by mixing it with irrigation water and 150 kg hm² of potassium fertilizer k2o was given in the form of a spray before sowing subsequently each plot was also given 0 3 l of a 30 solution of urea every 5 days the plots were mulched with a plastic film after sowing which was removed after seedling emergence initially 2 3 seeds were sown per hole at a depth of 0 03 m irrigation began after the final thinning at the four leaf stage and only one plant was left per hole to ensure that enough seedlings were available before starting the treatments all the plots were irrigated before sowing the quantity of irrigation 9 8 mm being determined based on the moisture content of the top layer the lower limit of the smp 0 2 m below the dripper was set at 10 kpa after the treatments began irrigation was controlled by the vacuum gauge readings were taken at 8 00 and 18 00 every day if the reading was lower than the lower limit irrigation was triggered immediately the total quantity of irrigation was 9 8 mm each event for all the treatments 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil sampling soil from each of the three ridges for each treatment was sampled twice a year the actual dates being 20 may and 17 september 2009 28 april and 16 september 2010 and 13 april and 14 september 2011 for each ridge the samples were collected from nine layers distributed as follows 0 0 05 0 05 0 10 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 3 0 3 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 0 8 1 0 and 1 0 1 2 m each layer was sampled at nine locations moving progressively away from the dripper horizontally up to 0 4 m in increments of 0 05 m fig 1 the samples were sealed air dried in the laboratory and ground fine enough to pass through a 1 mm sieve 2 3 2 soil water content and seasonal water consumption the soil samples for water content measurements were obtained with an auger 0 02 m in diameter and 0 15 m high in the same positions as above the water contents were measured by gravimetric method at intervals of 25 30 d during the cotton growing seasons of 2009 2011 seasonal water consumption or actual crop evapotranspiration eta mm for cotton in each treatment were estimated using a water balance approach james 1988 1 e t a i p c δ s r d where i is irrigation amount mm p is precipitation mm c is capillary rise to the root zone mm δs is the change of soil water storage mm r is surface runoff and d is percolation mm in eq 1 c was considered zero because the water table depth was 2 0 m below the ground surface runoff was assumed to be insignificant because the field was flat deep percolation was considered negligible because soil water contents swc below 0 6 m measurements were up to 1 2 m depth did not reach field capacity at any sampling time to estimate δs swc in the soil profile down to 0 8 m was determined by gravimetric measurements the variations of swc δs during the experiment were calculated using the average swc value of the soil samples 2 3 3 determination of the soil salinity and sodicity the ece of a saturated extract of soil was measured oster et al 1999 using a conductivity meter dds 11a ningbo biocotek scientific instrument co ningbo china the sar was calculated from the following equation using concentrations of the subscript cations na ca2 and mg2 in units of mmolc l 1 2 s a r c n a c c a c m g 2 1 2 concentrations of na were determined by flame photometer method and of ca2 and mg2 by edta titration method bao 2005 2 3 4 growth and physiological indicators 2 3 4 1 plant height stem diameter and leaf area in 2010 and 2011 plant height and stem diameter were recorded every 10 days for 10 plants from each replication for leaf area leaf length and width were measured in these 10 plants also every 10 days until the end of the growth period 2 3 4 2 biomass in mid september of 2010 and 2011 10 plants were selected from each replicate to determine the number of cotton bolls at the time of harvest late october and the weight dry weight of the entire plant and that of all the bolls on it were recorded 2 3 4 3 yield harvesting was done by hand the harvest lasted from early october to mid november the pickings in each plot being repeated every 7 10 days seed yield was recorded for each plot and lint percentage was recorded by ginning 1 kg of seed cotton from each plot 2 3 5 data analysis surfer ver 7 0 spss ver 16 0 and excel 2010 were used for data analysis analyses of variance were used to test the significance of treatment growing year and soil layer p 0 05 differences of treatments growing years and soil layers combinations were further evaluated by least significant difference lsd because of the different depth intervals the average value weighted average was used in the data analysis 3 weighted average σ sample content sampling depth or analytical depth 3 results 3 1 water table depth the water table depth in the experimental field during cotton growth seasons in 2010 and 2011 are presented in fig 2 the main factors likely to influence ground water are precipitation and irrigation in the area from 29 july flowering stage to 5 november after harvest in 2010 the water table rose from 3 1 to 2 7 m during winter 2010 and early spring 2011 the water table receded to 3 2 m however the water table rose from 3 1 to 2 6 m during the whole cotton growing season in 2011 and depths fluctuated more frequently than in 2010 fig 2 possibly because of more intense rainfall in 2010 moreover the large amount of flood irrigation water used in non salinized cotton fields around the experimental area may have raised the water table 3 2 soil texture and bulk density the soil texture at the experimental site was silt in each soil layer before sowing in 2009 table 2 during the three years of irrigation there were slight changes in soil texture the soil textures remained as silt in each depth 0 1 2 m but with minor changes in soil mechanical composition table 2 compared with soil texture the changes in soil bulk density sbd were more significant during the three years of reclamation for the s1 treatment sbd decreased significantly by 6 and 8 in 0 0 4 m and 0 4 0 8 m layers respectively after three years of irrigation however sbd increased for both s1 and s5 treatments in the deep layer 0 8 1 2 m compared with the initial value in 2009 although there was a slight but non significant p 0 05 decrease of sbd in the 0 0 4 m layer for the s5 treatment in 2011 3 3 irrigation and seasonal water consumption the amount of irrigation and the number of irrigations are shown in table 3 irrigation treatments were initiated on 15 june 2009 15 days after seeding 2 june 2010 22 days after seeding and 5 june 2010 27 days after seeding which corresponded to the days the seedlings were thinned in each experimental year the difference between the three years was because of the difference in the seasonal precipitation the total precipitation mm during the whole growth period was 67 3 114 6 and 70 4 respectively in 2009 2010 and 2011 the highest irrigation amount was for the s1 treatment during the whole growing season similarly the highest eta occurred in s1 treatment similarly owing to the adequate soil water supply during the growing season therefore the s1 treatment had the highest total water consumption 679 1 mm in 2009 659 6 mm in 2010 and 664 3 mm in 2011 the other treatments were subject to salt stress which resulted in lower eta the lowest eta was for the s5 treatment 25 kpa 279 8 mm in 2009 310 4 mm in 2010 and 253 2 mm in 2011 3 4 changes in ece prior to the 2009 sowing the salt content in the surface layer was high ece of 45 3 ds m table 4 far higher than the maximum of 7 7 ds m maas and hoffman 1977 at which cotton can grow in the deeper layers ece was significantly lower indicating that salt accumulated mainly at the surface 0 0 4 m in the 2009 growing season the salt was redistributed among the soil layers due to irrigation when irrigation was discontinued in september 2009 the distribution of salt showed higher values in the surface layer than in the deeper layers and salt content differed significantly among the layers by the time the irrigation was terminated the salt content of all the layers in treatments s1 and s2 was substantially lower than that before sowing in treatments s3 s4 and s5 the salt content at the surface was lower but that in the deeper layers was higher probably because the smaller quantities of irrigation in 2009 in these three treatments leached the surface salt layers where it accumulated on discontinuing irrigation the salt moved back to the soil surface as the water evaporated from late winter to early spring so that salt level in every soil layer in april 2010 was higher than in the corresponding layer in september 2009 although the salt rebound rates decreased with the decreasing soil layer the value of ece in the 0 0 4 m layers in s1 s2 and s3 continued to be lower than that in the deeper layers and surface salt levels in s4 and s5 were higher suggesting that the upward movement of salt is extensive in spring and winter and that inadequate irrigation favors salt accumulation at the surface on discontinuing the irrigation in 2010 the ece value of each soil layer decreased again indicating that soil mass in the upper layers 0 1 2 m especially that in the root zone 0 0 4 m had managed to retain its low salt status despite the upward movement of salt in spring and winter the salt content in each soil layer before sowing and after irrigation in 2011 was similar to that in 2010 the ece value in the root zone after irrigation was only 4 3 ds m in s1 and even in s5 it had dropped to 16 1 ds m a 63 reduction compared to the value in 2009 before the experiment began as to the variation in the same layers in different years the ece value in all the layers was the lowest in 2011 and significantly different from that in the other years suggesting a steady decrease in the salt level over time because of irrigation both smp and the number of years over which the plots had been irrigated affected the ece values greatly and so did the interaction between the matric potential and the number of years and that among the matric potential the number of years and depths 3 5 changes in sar the index of sar represents soil sodicity in the present study a high sar 13 is reportedly responsible for poor physical properties of the soil including restricted aeration and moisture movement singh and abrol 1985 in this study the changes in sar with time table 5 were similar as those of ece table 4 greater reductions of sar occurred in 0 0 4 m than 0 4 0 8 and 0 8 1 2 m depths after the third irrigation season the decline in sar in the 0 40 cm depth relative to the initial level ranged within 10 38 and the rates increased with increasing smp thresholds for treatments s3 s4 and s5 a reduction only occurred in 0 0 4 m depth table 5 whereas for 0 8 1 2 m the final sar was higher than the initial sar in 2009 similar to ece in spring there were significant rebounds for sar in each soil depth and the rebounds increased with decreasing smp threshold the relative reductions for sar values were smaller than for ece possibly because of the buffering of exchange capacity compared with the initial value in 2009 the values for treatments in root zone after irrigation was terminated showed continued reductions in each growing season similarly to ece the effects of smp threshold growing years and soil layers and their interactions all had significant effects on sar values table 5 by comparing the content after harvest in 2011 with initial values in 2009 the decreasing rates of four main ions cl na ca2 and mg2 within 0 0 4 m and 0 1 2 m soil depths were calculated fig 3 there were clearly greater rates of decrease for ion contents in shallow 0 0 4 m than in deep soil layers 0 1 2 m the decreasing rates of cl content in the two soil layers ranged within 58 3 94 4 and increased with increasing smp thresholds the decrease rates for na showed similar variations to cl except for rates in deep soil layers with low smp thresholds s3 s5 which ranged within 35 6 55 6 in contrast the decrease rates for ca2 and mg2 during the three years of reclamation were lower than for na and cl especially at high smp thresholds s1 and s2 after three years of irrigation the decrease rates for ca2 and mg2 in the two soil layers ranged within 25 7 66 8 and increased with increasing smp thresholds similar to those of cl and na 3 6 dynamics of cotton growth 3 6 1 plant height and leaf area index plant height exhibited an s shaped curve from the seedling to the boll stage in 2010 fig 4 a relatively slow initial growth more repaid growth in the middle of the growth period and slow growth again towards the end of the growth period however growth in 2011 did not follow that pattern because of greater precipitation 27 mm in early april and may which resulted in excessive growth of cotton during that period in 2010 the treatments involving greater quantities of irrigation s1 and s2 resulted in rapid growth whereas the shortest plants were seen in s5 over time the level of salt in the soil decreased gradually as did the differences among treatments therefore the difference in plant height among different treatments was smaller in 2011 than that in 2010 the leaf area index lai also showed a similar s shaped curve because of greater irrigation and sufficient leaching of salt in s1 and s2 the mild saline stress resulted in rapid growth whereas growth was far slower in s4 and s5 because of the severe salt stress from smaller quantities of irrigation irrigation was discontinued after the boll stage and the lai decreased because of wilting and even defoliation because of the higher precipitation during the early growth period in 2011 the pattern of changes in lai in each treatment was different from that in the corresponding treatment in 2010 namely more rapid growth at the beginning which was comparable to the rate seen in mid term in 2010 and the faster growth in s1 and s2 3 6 2 yield and yield components in the present study the following attributes were considered as cotton yield components germination percentage number of bolls per plant seed weight per boll and lint percentage table 6 prior to sowing in 2009 germination was lower than 35 in all the treatments because of high salt content in the soil all the differences between them were significant and were also seen in 2010 because of irrigation in 2009 leaching of salts from the root zone was higher in s1 and s2 which increased the germination percentage in those two treatments whereas it was relatively low in the other three treatments in 2011 germination was greatly improved and reached 67 in all the treatments with no substantial difference among them indicating that the salt had been effectively leached as a result of the previous year s irrigation late sowing high level of salt and a local storm in 2009 resulted in higher mortality of cotton seedlings in october 2009 the maturing of bolls was inhibited owing to an abrupt decrease in temperature and no yield data could be collected in that year in 2010 the number of bolls per plant differed significantly among treatments and decreased with decreasing smp in 2011 the relationship between the number of bolls per plant and the matric potential was not uniform at the matric potential higher than 20 kpa the boll number per plant increased as the reduction in smp but it decreases as the reduction in smp was lower than 20 kpa in 2010 both seed weight per boll and lint percentage differed significantly among the treatments table 6 initially up to 15 kpa seed weight increased as the matric potential increased but decreased as the potential increased beyond 15 kpa in 2011 the seed weight did not differ substantially among the treatments although it was much more than that in 2010 in all the treatments indicating that lower soil salt level had increased the weight per boll and lint percentage to some extent in 2010 the yield of lint and seed in s1 was 69 of that from a local non saline soil and went up to 86 in 2010 in both years the yields of lint and seed increased as the smp decreased 3 7 soil salt level and yield components in the present study the major factors that affected plant growth were soil moisture and salt but salt was affected mainly by irrigation tables 3 and 4 therefore regression analysis was used to study the relationship between the components of yield and soil salt salinity and sodicity soil salinity and sodicity ece and sar value towards the later stages of growth in the top 40 cm layers based on root distribution as a result of drip irrigation hanson et al 2006 hu et al 2009 was taken as the main factor influencing yield because that value was seen to have a significant effect on the growth of cotton in 2010 and 2011 germination percentage was significantly and linearly correlated with both soil ece and sar value of the root zone figs 5 and 6 suggesting that salt has a significant effect on germination percentage whereas no such correlation was seen in 2009 in 2010 the number of bolls per plant decreased with the decrease in ece and sar showing a significant linear correlation between them in 2011 however the number of bolls per plant increased initially with increase in ece and sar but began to decline as the values reached 16 ds m and 21 mmolc l 1 0 5 seed weight per boll on the other hand showed the opposite pattern an initial increase followed by a decrease as the ece and sar values increased beyond a point in 2010 and a negative linear correlation in 2011 in 2010 and 2011 although no significant linear correlation of lint percentage with both ece and sar were seen lint percentage in 2011 was significantly higher than that in 2010 indicating that a lower salt level increases lint percentage ashraf and ahmad 2000 the effects of ece and sar levels in the root zone on the yields of lint and seed were dramatic and both showed a significant linear correlation with ece and sar in 2010 and 2011 fig 7 the yield of lint and seed in 2011 was higher than that in 2010 in all the treatments with s1 and s5 showing the largest increase 25 in the case of lint and 42 in that of seed in s1 the corresponding values in s5 being and 42 and 92 fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 effect of smp thresholds on soil salt in the saline region of xinjiang stress caused by soil salinity and sodicity is the main reason for the restricted growth of cotton more frequent drip irrigation but in smaller quantities and over a longer duration maintained a higher level of smp around the dripper and leached the salt ions away from the root zone compensating to some extent for the lower soil permeability due to high salt levels and thus led to higher uptake of water in addition mulching with a film reduced surface evaporation thereby promoting the retention of soil moisture and inhibiting the upward movement of salt to the surface dou and kang 2010 used a combination of planting on ridges mulching and drip irrigation to study the regulation of soil moisture in the saline sodic soils of the pingluo region in ningxia and demonstrated that soil salt in the root zone was effectively leached away after three years of irrigation and jiao et al 2008 showed that the highest leaching and the highest crop yield were obtained when the smp was set at 5 kpa during drip irrigation in the qingtongxia region in ningxia in the present study after three years of irrigation the ece and sar of soil within the root zone at 5 kpa was only 4 3 ds m and 10 mmolc l 1 0 5 compared to 16 1 ds m and 24 mmolc l 1 0 5 at 25 kpa respectively with lower quantity of irrigation the value was reduced to 63 of that in 2009 before initiating the experiment and the soil had already turned into mildly saline soil as it did in ningxia jiao et al 2006 and as reported by wan et al 2012 indicating that the combination of ridge planting mulching and drip irrigation is particularly suitable for the saline wastelands of xinjiang li et al 2016 found that the optimal threshold of smp should be 10 kpa for a salt sensitive plant in a coastal saline region in our study more water was applied for the s1 than other treatments and leached salt from the 0 0 4 m depth in treatments with low smp thresholds s2 s5 was more prone to accumulate in 0 4 0 8 and 0 8 1 2 m soil layers moreover because of the lateral and downward movement of water and salt that occurs beneath drip emitters wang et al 2012 significant reductions occurred during each irrigation season followed by a significant rebound during winter the ratio of lateral movement to downward movement likely increased with decreasing applied water which would explain why the rebound in salinity was greater for the s2 s5 treatments than the s1 therefore the lower limit of 5 kpa for the smp at 0 2 m below the dripper can serve as a guide and should be used for 3 years before sowing the difference in the trigger target was that leaching was affected not only by the frequency and quantity of irrigation but also by the composition of salts climate and other farming practices in the present study the reductions for sar values were smaller than for ece this may be because of buffering of exchange capacity carmona et al 2010 which can also be found in the decreasing rates for the four main soil ions after three years of irrigation fig 3 the decrease rates for na and cl were much higher than for ca2 and mg2 the mutual effects of soil salinity and sodicity made leaching more difficult than the individual effect of the two qadir et al 2002 found that the h released by roots released ca from insoluble solid salts as ca² which lowered soil na because of the ion substitution effect thereby lowering the sar in such saline sodic soils and improving the physical properties of soil which was one reason for the improved soil condition after three years in the present study soil structure improved as shown by sbd table 2 especially in the shallow soil layer with high smp thresholds s1 treatment 4 2 effects of smp thresholds on cotton growth in severely saline sodic soils high salinity and sodicity is the main reason for the poor performance of cotton including osmotic stress ion toxicity ion imbalance and nutritional deficiency fisher et al 1994 of these salt stress is the main factor which inhibits photosynthesis and lowers carbon assimilation in addition the synthesis and accumulation of substances which at their normal concentrations help in osmotic adjustment and the maintenance of osmotic potential results in greater energy consumption accelerated senescence and eventual death due to carbon starvation yu and tang 1998 the saline sodic soil in this study area is of the chloride sulfate type and salt stress comes mainly from na in the present experiment treatments that involved larger quantities of irrigation namely s1 and s2 resulted in higher growth parameters whereas salt stress was more severe in the treatment that involved the lowest quantity of irrigation treatment namely s5 resulting in the shortest plants which is consistent with earlier results bassil and kaffka 2002 chen et al 2009 kang et al 2010 it was noted that high soil sodicity had no effect on the number of bolls and fruit weight but did reduce plant height of cotton dodd et al 2010 however in our study the combined effects of high salinity and sodicity had an adverse effect on cotton growth especially in the first two years when soil salts were relatively high table 6 in s1 the growth peak was delayed compared to that in the other treatments mainly because of the more copious irrigation and milder salt stress in s1 compared to other developmental stages the seedling stage is more sensitive to soil salt zhang et al 2008 dong et al 2009 in the experimental region the salt level was high in 2009 before sowing which resulted in low germination percentage 35 in all treatments after three years of irrigation it increased significantly to more than 67 in all treatments following marked improvement in the physicochemical properties of soil due to adequate leaching of salts and especially due to the marked increase in soil porosity and nutrient content wang et al 2015 4 3 correlations between soil salt and cotton yield components generally the major factors that affect plant growth in arid saline land are soil moisture and salt however in this study salt was affected mainly by irrigation tables 4 and 5 therefore we used regression analysis to investigate the relationships between cotton yield components and soil salt salinity and sodicity the results showed that the variation trends of yield components with soil salinity and sodicity were similar the number of bolls per plant decreased with the decrease in both ece and sar in the root zone and showed significant linear relationships consistent with earlier results daleshwar et al 2006 dağdelen et al 2009 however in 2011 the number of bolls per plant increased initially with both ece and sar but declined later as ece and sar reached 16 ds m and 21 mmolc l 1 0 5 respectively whereas the weight per boll showed the opposite pattern an initial increase followed by a decrease as ece and sar increased but showed a significant linear negative correlation to both soil ece and sar in 2011 probably because the gradual reduction in salt over time had changed the main factors affecting reproductive growth of cotton however given the increased plant population and the same amount of fertilizers meant that each plant had a smaller share of fertilizers under the high matric potential treatments low ece and sar value which to some extent affected the reproductive growth of cotton it was reported that in a salt affected soil the decrease in cotton yield was mainly due to reduction in boll number zhang et al 2017 in our study the main factor that affected cotton yield was probably the germination rate as the variation trends with soil salt salinity and sodicity were similar over the last two years in s5 soil salt remained the major factor affecting growth because of the relatively high soil salt levels in 2010 and 2011 differences in the extent of leaching under different smps lead to various changes in the physicochemical properties of soil such as porosity and nutrient status which affect the growth and yield of crops rasouli et al 2013 in the present study the yield of lint and seed under s1 was 69 of that in non saline soils and increased to 86 in 2011 the cotton yields were lower at lower matric potentials consistent with earlier results for other crops in the saline soils of ningxia tan and kang 2009 5 conclusion the smp thresholds affected the extent of leaching of salts significantly during the growth period of cotton soil ece and sar value decreased gradually in each soil layer although the level of salt rose again in spring and winter however soil in the root zone the first two layers namely 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m continued to be low in salt after three years of irrigation maximum leaching was observed at the smp of 5 kpa a combination of ridge planting mulching and drip irrigation to regulate the level of soil moisture and salt in saline soils with high ece and sar achieved the desired effects in the form of higher germination percentage greater reproductive growth and increased yield the higher the smp the more extensive the leaching and the better was the growth of cotton maximum yields were obtained at the smp of 5 kpa being 69 and 86 of the yields from non saline soil over 2 and 3 years respectively the decrease of cotton yield was mainly due to the reduction of germination rate in xinjiang region by examining the extent of leaching layer by layer and its effect on the growth and yield of cotton the lower limit of 5 kpa for the smp at 0 2 m below the dripper can serve as a guide for irrigating the land in the first three years before sowing cotton during the reclamation of

11337,traditional water harvesting tank systems are integral to agricultural development and livelihoods of rural communities in india despite the fact that these systems provide number of services drinking water protective irrigation etc their importance and contribution declined during the post independence india population pressure along with poor maintenance have led to their deterioration for instance the number tanks not in use has doubled between 2000 01 and 2010 11 the share of tank irrigation in to total irrigation in india declined from 17 to 2 5 between 1950 51 and 2014 15 realising the multiple benefits from theses traditional systems tank rehabilitation has been one of the policy priorities at the central as well as in some states this paper is a review of experiences on tank systems and their rehabilitation across the regions of india the idea is to explore the variations in tank systems across the regions and identify specific approaches for strengthening and promoting them tank uses benefits users or stakeholders differ from region to region hence the priorities may not be same in all the regions the evidence across the regions indicates that the benefits from tank rehabilitation outweigh the costs it is argued that scaling up of tank rehabilitation at the national and state level is critical for providing substantial benefits to the local communities while the policy initiatives to restore irrigation tanks are rational the interventions need to be based on the changing conditions in terms of groundwater development and climate variability in the specific regions keywords tank rehabilitation irrigation management participatory india 1 introduction in india age old water harvesting and storage systems such as tanks and ponds are becoming things of the past because of lack of any sort of maintenance by the state or civil society these traditional systems have degenerated overtime because of unwarranted interventions by the state and changing socio economic and political conditions at the village level as a result area under tank irrigation has declined substantially at the all india level i e 3 6 million hectares 17 in 1950 51 to 1 7 million hectares 2 5 in 2014 15 1 1 compiled from the directorate of economics and statistics for different years ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare government of india figures are provisional for the year 2014 15 though the extent of deterioration varies across states cwc 2010 this declining capacity of the tanks has not only led to loss of area under irrigation but also groundwater recharge in the tank dominated regions that are relatively dry drought prone and dependent on wells as tanks improve recharge by 40 per cent meter et al 2016 well irrigation recorded a phenomenal rise especially during 1970s and 1980s and moved from second to the first position in terms of area irrigated by a single source this has in turn created considerable imbalance in the ecological and social systems of the country declining tank irrigation and expansion of groundwater irrigation are observed across india especially in the drought prone regions the literature identifies numerous socio economic institutional and physical reasons for the decline of tank irrigation von oppen and rao 1980a reddy 1990 1995 shankari 1991 janakarajan 1993 reddy et al 1993 palanisami 2006 and 2008 palanisami et al 2011 nehlin 2016 the decline in tank irrigation has been linked with increasing population density von oppen and rao 1980b it has also been linked to the development of well irrigation palanisami 2006 for the decline in benefits from community based technology sources tanks has prompted people to shift towards individual based technology sources wells this however connotes a wrong notion of substitutability between tank and well irrigation particularly because tanks complement groundwater development in reality the decline of traditional systems therefore is a cumulative effect of policy and institutional neglect in the pre independence past before 1947 institutional arrangements such as dasabandam and kudimaramat of south india aher pyne systems of south bihar chandeli tanks of bhundelkh and johads and pals of rajasthan were in place to protect these systems from decay these institutional arrangements nurtured by the benevolent local rulers have been central to development and sustenance of the tank systems over centuries however the policy shift towards major and medium irrigation 2 2 major irrigation schemes are those with a culturable command irrigated area of 10 000 hectares and medium irrigation schemes are those with 2 000 to 10 000 hectares during the british period coupled with the changes in policy perception of irrigation development that is treating irrigation as a productive revenue generating source rather than a protective source has resulted in the degeneration of these institutions in addition overall environmental degradation especially in drought prone regions has led to silting up of tanks and shrinking of their capacities this in turn has led to the shift towards private well irrigation declining tank irrigation and expansion of well irrigation were slowed down towards the end of the british period and the slow down continued until the 1980s the second phase of the tank systems decline was triggered by the advent of the energization of groundwater lifting mechanisms the new technologies in pumping systems during the1980s coupled with the benefits from green revolution technology have resulted in an unprecedented expansion of groundwater development further poor farmers were not in a position to adopt these technologies because of their capital intensive nature especially during the initial stages due to over exploitation oe a large number of open wells have started drying up in drought prone regions in fact well failure including borewells has become a common phenomenon in the recent past as the policies have been passive realising the importance of protecting and sustaining these systems tank rehabilitation programmes have been initiated by the state governments bi lateral agencies and non governmental organisations ngos in number of states reddy 2015 of late tank rehabilitation and modernisation has been initiated at the national level with budgetary allocations while rehabilitation is defined as bringing back the systems to their original technical form modernisation is defined as upgradation of the systems with modern infrastructure and management shah and raju 2002 modernization thus also involves institutional arrangements for managing the systems in fact management is increasingly becoming critical for rehabilitating the systems for in the absence of appropriate and effective institutional arrangements investing in rehabilitation may not be a viable proposition therefore rehabilitation and modernisation could involve number of activities such as strengthening the bund sluice repair de silting treatment of catchment repairs to feeder channels and irrigation canals institutional arrangements etc some of these activities are taken up in the rehabilitation programmes though institutional aspects are gaining importance in the recent years although there is every reason to protect and strengthen these traditional systems it needs to be based on the region specific nature and importance of tank systems for tank systems differ in their size extent functionality management etc from region to region and hence requires specific approaches for their rehabilitation and management in a sustainable manner the economic viability of tanks given their scale is crucial for the communities to realize their importance in improving their livelihoods tanks being common pool resources cprs collective action is a prerequisite to manage them in a sustainable manner this becomes important in the context of the changing socio economic and political scenario this paper is an attempt to explore the variations in tank systems across the regions and identify specific approaches for strengthening and promoting them across regions specific objectives include a assess the extent and importance of tank systems across the four regions north south east and west b examine the various tank management practices across these regions c examine various tank rehabilitation interventions and their impacts in different regions and d suggest appropriate tank rehabilitation strategies in the changing socio economic environmental and policy context this paper is based on the literature available across the states and provides a meta analysis of various aspects this paper is organised in six sections after the introductory section one the following section two presents the status of tank irrigation across the four regions of the country and sets the priorities for tank rehabilitation in these regions section three provides the rationale and importance of tank rehabilitation interventions section four discusses the impact of tank rehabilitation programmes the importance and nature of tank rehabilitation in the changing environmental and policy context is discussed in section five and the last section six makes some concluding remarks and suggests region specific policy options 2 status and profile of tank irrigation across regions in india 2 1 extent of tank irrigation all the major states and union territories uts in india are grouped under five regions as per the planning commission viz south north east and west table 1 north eastern states are not included here as there are no studies available for this region research on tank irrigation is mainly focused on south east and western regions and very few studies are available from northern states this could be due to the relative importance of tank irrigation in these regions or states irrigated area under tanks has been declining since 1950 51 while all other sources have recorded an increase fig 1 the minor irrigation 3 3 minor irrigation schemes are those with less than 2000 ha of culturable command irrigated area mi census carried out by the ministry of water resources mowr provide the information on tanks at the state level every five years since 1986 87 but only 2010 11 mi census are the latest available 4 4 the data are released with a lag of 3 5 years the 2016 17 census data are likely to be available by 2020 at the latest even the data provided in these censuses are not consistent over the years only in one year 2000 01 number of tanks in use is given separately while in other years tanks are given under surface water flows which includes canal irrigation as well these two figures are not comparable as tanks in use account for less than 50 per cent of the surface water flows and the 50 per cent decline between 1986 87 and 2000 01 in some studies pant and verma 2009 is not real fig 2 over the years there is an increase in the number of tanks from 0 5 million in 1986 87 to 0 64 million in 2000 01 and then they declined to 0 6 million in 2006 07 this may be due to watershed development programmes wsdp after the 1990s under which number of surface water bodies are being created among the regions north and west have recorded an increase while south and east reported decline in surface water bodies between 1986 87 and 2006 07 in the absence of accurate data across all the states the number of tanks and ponds in india are reported to vary between 0 2 to 0 35 million adb 2006 the number of tanks in use assessed by the mi census in 2000 01 was 0 23 million in india fig 3 besides an estimated 42 955 tanks were not in use in 2000 01 which has gone up to 85 807 in 2010 11 5 5 these figures are provided by indiastat com the actual year of reference is not clear as the data was sourced from a parliament question in 2011 together this provides an estimate of number of tanks in the range of 0 3 million in india southern region accounts for 35 per cent of the total tanks in use in india 2000 01 followed by west 20 east 16 and north 14 east has the highest proportion of tanks not in use 21 471 out of 42 740 in 2010 11 followed by south 35 742 out of 102 991 in 210 11 west and north the high density of tanks in use as well as decayed tanks in south could be the reason for the focus the region received in terms of tank renovation programmes the variations in the density of tanks across states are basically due to geo hydrological topography and rainfall patterns the topography of deccan plateau south india with undulating topography and rocky substrata are ideal for locating tanks and gravity irrigation the geological formation of hard granite limits deep groundwater percolation warranting surface storage structures in case of the plains in south bihar and chota nagpur plateau tank irrigation is an outcome of the natural condition and physical configuration of the area and has been evolved to overcome the obstacles of irrigation adb 2006 on the other hand most of the north indian states have small ponds mainly for the purpose of inland fisheries though they are also used for irrigation purposes thus the density prominence and importance of the tank systems across the regions are critically linked to the natural and economic factors in the case of area under tank irrigation data are drawn from different sources and data are available till 2014 15 area under tank irrigation between 1972 and 2008 has declined steadily in north and south regions as well as at the all india level though there appears to be a sort of a revival between 2003 and 2008 fig 4 this could be due to the advent of tank rehabilitation programmes in some of the southern and eastern states over the last 3 decades area under tank irrigation has declined by 1 million hectares at the all india level of this more than 0 7 million hectares of area is from southern region consisting of ap tamil nadu karnataka and kerala the share of different regions in the total area under tanks has declined between 1972 and 2008 in south and north regions i e from 58 to 53 per cent in south and from 14 to 9 per cent in north fig 5 on the other hand the share of east has improved from 17 to 21 per cent and in west from 12 to 17 per cent over the period while south indian states account for 35 per cent of the total tanks in use they account for more than 50 per cent of the area as per 2008 data the four southern states account for 53 per cent of the total area under tanks in the country followed by east india states 21 west and north indian states relative importance of tank irrigation in overall irrigation has come down substantially over years at the all india level the share of tank irrigation has declined from 12 per cent in 1972 to 3 per cent in 2008 fig 6 within the respective regions also the importance of tank irrigation declined substantially over these years tank irrigation however holds relatively greater importance in south and east india states this could be one of the reasons for the attention these regions get in terms of tank rehabilitation initiatives whereas tank irrigation accounts for 5 per cent of total irrigated area in west and 1 per cent in the north indian states 2 2 nature of tank systems tanks are rainfall dependent and majority of the tank systems are located in arid and semi arid regions with high temperatures the weak relationship between rainfall and area under tank irrigation in states like tamil nadu could be due to degradation encroachment and urbanisation change in land use of the catchment areas of the systems and the declining dependence on tanks over the years especially after 1970s palanisami and easter 2000 jana et al 2012 narayanamoorthy and suresh 2016 that is run off is reduced or diverted from reaching the tanks tanks provide protective irrigation and the area covered is always more during the good rainfall years in fact in good rainfall years farmers grow two crops under tanks as the demand for water during kharif is low in such years palanisami et al 2008 in the recent years tail end farmers of the distribution system receive tank water only during good rainfall years the size of the tanks is influenced by the magnitude and distribution of rainfall accordingly size of tanks varies across the regions most of the tanks have the submergence water covered area of less than 5 ha pant and verma 2009 palanisami et al 2010 their command irrigated area is less than 50 ha in 80 per cent of the cases the ratio of submergence area to command area differs from 1 5 to 4 acres in southern and eastern states jharkhand has the lowest ratio of 1 5 on the other hand tanks in western states like rajasthan are described as bigger when compared to southern states tanks in rajasthan have a command area of more than 500 ha shah and raju 2002 this could be due to low and intensive rainfall in these regions i e less than 700 mm rainfall takes place in a few rainy days on the other hand in tamil nadu rainfall is distributed over a period of more than 6 months with an average annual rainfall of about 900 mm on the other hand eastern states of odisha bihar west bengal and jharkhand get fairly high rainfall of above 1000 mm due to the differences in rainfall and hydrogeology the south india tanks were interlinked cascading in order to store as much water as possible from the seasonal rains the ease of gravity irrigation in these regions has made them popular even among the policy makers over the years historically tanks have been constructed to store water in order to provide drinking water and protective irrigation during dry periods in some regions like bundelkhand the chandeli tanks were primarily built for recreation and domestic purpose and the numerous tanks in south were primarily built for protective irrigation purposes irrespective of the historical reasons the british have converted most of these tanks in to irrigation tanks in order to increase their agricultural revenues shah 2003 in eastern india majority of the tanks are multi purpose for domestic use irrigation and fish production though their primary purpose is irrigation adb 2006 pant and verma 2009 kumar et al 2011 jana et al 2012 tanks and ponds have been the primary source of water for poor rural households in eastern india including odisha recent research shows that they are being converted into fish ponds by local communities or panchayats this could be due to the declining viability of agriculture in general and specifically under tanks for inflows into the tanks have declined substantially in recent years due to the catchment interventions such as watershed programmes urbanisation etc though the tank systems have not been designed to facilitate multiple uses like domestic use fisheries livestock and irrigation the systems by default become a multiple use systems due to anthropogenic pressure while some of the unplanned uses may get absorbed by the system other uses can damage it van koppen et al 2009 often the competing water needs of the tanks results in conflicts between different users such as irrigators and fishermen in the process some of the strident needs like drinking water or livestock water needs face severe stress and the poor become the first victims in the process as they are kept out of the process in bundelkhand also tanks are being used for multi purposes though fishing seems to be the dominant activity of late shah 2003 irrespective of these direct or primary benefits tanks serve number of socio ecological purposes like soil and water conservation reduced run off groundwater recharge and enhanced resilience in the context of floods and drought provision of highly fertile silt etc some of these uses or benefits contradict the interests of primary beneficiaries like those getting low cost irrigation for instance in rajasthan the interests of farmers who cultivate the tank bed conflict with the interests of command irrigated area farmers shah and raju 2002 the purpose for which the tank is being used in the socio economic context is critical for the sustainability of the systems for instance if tanks provide substantial irrigation benefits in agrarian communities they are likely to be maintained better due to local interests in the case of bundelkhand greater economic benefits from fishing has prompted fishing groups taking more interest in taking over the tank management shah 2003 tanks in rajasthan are life savers in the arid conditions where rainfall occurs only for a few days in a year the main purposes of these tanks are protective irrigation soil and water conservation drinking water for human and livestock population livestock economy in rajasthan is as important if not more as agriculture these tanks help capture conserve and store the little but intensive rainfall the region receives and in the process reduce soil erosion by cutting the pace and momentum of run off waters the stored water is used for protective irrigation as well as helps recharge groundwater aquifers which provide a stable and reliable source of irrigation and domestic water supply tank silt provides the natural fertiliser for the degraded soils unlike large reservoirs and tanks in south india tank beds in rajasthan are used both for water storage as well as for cultivation as a rule farmers grow winter and sometimes summer crops in tank beds after they are emptied and the method of irrigation is different as the entire tank is emptied at one go to facilitate tank bed cultivation this is known as inundation irrigation which has its advantages and disadvantages apart from conflicting interests between tank bed and command area farmers shah and raju 2002 raju and shah 2000 2 3 tanks and groundwater there is a clear and close link between well irrigation and tank storage especially in areas with confined aquifers with rock stratum at 40 50 feet below ground shah and raju 2002 tanks by storing the runoff water for longer periods help recharging groundwater as a result well owners are an important stakeholder group of the tank systems they have conflicting interests with the command area farmers in most of the regions benefits from groundwater recharge have exceeded the direct irrigation benefits from the tanks in rajasthan the benefits from improved productivity of wells due to groundwater recharge extends beyond command and tank bed areas shah and raju 2002 this is even reflected in the increased land values beyond command area and hence considered as the most valuable benefit farmer s gain from the tanks this is mainly due to the decline in the capacity of tanks resulting in shrinking of command area in fact groundwater irrigation in the tank commands is more reliable due to good recharge and also available throughout the crop season in most cases tail end farmers mostly rely on groundwater due to unreliable water supplies from tanks a u shaped relationship between the number of private wells and tank degradation has been observed in tamil nadu balasubramanian and selveraj 2003 the interaction between tank irrigation surface water and groundwater levels is found to be strong in west bengal chowdhury and behera 2018 in tamila nadu it was observed that tanks helps in increasing the recharge by 40 percent kimberly et al 2016 it is argued that both tank irrigation and well irrigation should be used as complementary rather than substitutes in order to maintain a hydrological balance and manage water resources sustainably in the long run wells are also used as a mechanism to privatise cprs like tank water as a result percolation tanks pts are being preferred in place of irrigation tanks reddy and behera 2009a indeed there might be value in thinking of irrigation tanks primarily as pts designed to maximize groundwater recharge over as large an area around the tank as possible more importantly groundwater depth has improved substantially above 20 per cent in the case of restored tanks when compared with the control villages in rajasthan the practice of inundation irrigation helps recharge the aquifers and also helps top soils retain enough moisture for rabi crop apart from facilitating tank bed cultivation shah and raju 2002 the flooding also helps in filling the small upland ponds in the command area unlike in other states tank bed farmers are as important as command area farmers in rajasthan in fact tank bed farmers are more influential than the command area farmers given their control on water release and flooding of the command area raju and shah 2000 in this process while the tank bed farmers benefit from cultivating the tank bed with the available moisture command area farmers benefit from groundwater recharge tank bed farmers also use groundwater for protective irrigation purposes thus groundwater recharge is the main benefit from these tanks on the other hand groundwater development is limited under the tank systems in the east indian states like odisha and also in parts of tamil nadu groundwater irrigation is limited to open wells due to the viability of swallow aquifers and better rainfall conditions in the eastern regions in tamil nadu it was observed that there is potential to increase the well density by 25 per cent in the tank commands as only 15 per cent of the farmers have wells palanisami and amarasinghe 2008 despite the declining area under tank irrigation in recent years coupled with the declining groundwater conjunctive use of groundwater with tank water has not spread much this is often due to low productivity of agriculture resulting in low capacity of farmers to invest in bore wells this appears to be in contrast with other regions where tanks are abandoned due to the increased dependence on groundwater kajisa et al 2006 this has disturbed the ecological balance between surface groundwater dynamics in the context of eastern region where such balance seems to exist there is need to explore the hydrogeological aspects in order to promote sustainable conjunctive use of groundwater along with tank water it is observed that surface irrigation sources like tanks are more equitable when compared to groundwater this is mainly due to the riparian access to water and low cost nature of irrigation at the all india level area under tank irrigation has fluctuated between 1976 and 1991 but it has expanded at an annual rate of 1 4 per cent in the marginal farm 1 ha category and just by 0 1 per cent in the case of small farm 2 ha category goi 1992 in all other farms with a holding size of more than 2 ha tank irrigated area has declined and annual rate of decline varied from 0 9 per cent to 3 1 per cent despite the limited expansion of tank irrigated area its role in promoting equity cannot be ignored since the share of small and marginal farm holdings in the total farm holdings in the tank command area is very high as of now it was observed that poor farmers less than 2 ha still use a major share of tank irrigated area in india as their share in tank irrigated area has gone up from 40 per cent in 1970 71to 55 per cent in 1990 91 on the other hand the share of large farmers declined from 14 per cent to 6 per cent narayanamoorthy 2007 these trends hold good across different states where tank irrigation still has a considerable presence like ap and karnataka as large farmers are observed to be shifting to well irrigation besides irrigation poor households also depend more on tanks for various other uses such as livestock grazing fishery etc consequently poor households are observed to spend 100 per cent more labour than their on poor counterparts on tank maintenance activities balasubramanian and selveraj 2003 it was argued that the shift away from tank irrigation to groundwater irrigation may adversely impact equity due to the heavy investments required for well irrigation for poor farmers may not be able to make such lump sum investments this argument is often used against the conversion of irrigation tanks into pts reddy and behera 2009a but field research indicates that there is a structural change in the ownership of wells in the recent years it was observed that wells especially borewells are no longer privy to large farmers as more and more small and marginal farmers smf seem to be investing in bore wells this may be due to the availability of cheap quality pumps at lower prices during the recent years moreover farmers are forced to invest often with borrowed money in borewells due to the drying up of open wells reddy 2005 however availability of groundwater is critically linked with the sustainability of groundwater recharge 2 4 ownership and management in the indian context there is no historical evidence of construction and management of irrigation systems by farmers alone chanakya the author of arthashastra urged the rulers to assist the farmers in the construction of irrigation works besides extending various incentives during the period 13th 16th century in the vijayanagara empire now part of karnataka a series of tanks were built by rulers in which farmers participated voluntarily in the construction and maintenance though there were conflicts among the farmers similar is the case during the regime of chola now tamil nadu joshi 1997 tank systems across the country were built by benevolent rulers with some voluntary support from farmers and majority of the existing tank systems were constructed during pre british period during the colonial period irrigation was the exclusive responsibility of the civil engineering department the projects were conceived executed and managed as top down engineering projects stone 1984 in south india after the tanks were taken over by the state administration and a large number were in disuse due to neglect by the indigenous management of irrigation systems the british administration hardly conceived of communal or local water rights not just in india but also in other parts of the world irrespective of the ownership tanks are mostly used by communities across the country private ownership of tanks is greater at 37 per cent in the east indian states of bihar jharkhand odisha and west bengal though 83 per cent of the tanks have open access as far as use is concerned in west bengal 77 per cent of the tanks have open access despite the fact that it has the highest proportion of tanks 64 per cent under private ownership pant and verma 2009 however the pattern of ownership may have to be taken in to account while initiating tank rehabilitation programmes number of studies has observed that historically these systems have been managed on community basis across the country till the british rulers have interfered in their management in fact community management was promoted and supported by the rulers by providing incentives these incentives are in the form of rent free land to the families that take the responsibility of tank management these forms are known as dasabandam in the south sagar rakshya jagir in the east reddy 1990 and pant and verma 2009 for instance in himachal pradesh out of 1 00 000 ha of irrigated area 70 000 ha were managed by communal systems called khuls coward 1990 maharashtra has the long history of development and management of private irrigation schemes the irrigation department used to manage the state s canal systems and the basic irrigation management approach is called shejpali although alternatives exist it adopted a policy to create water user associations wuas at minor canal level with average command of 500 ha transfer operation maintenance o m responsibilities for the minor and smaller channels to the wuas allocate water to the wuas through five year agreements and charge wuas for water on the basis of the volume actually taken volumetric pricing the irrigation rights documented by the british era provide much of the social glue required for operating and sustaining these systems their cohesion now is dependent ultimately on property rights legitimised by the state rather than by local custom in madras an office of superintendent of tank repairs was formed in 1809 and staffed by a civil engineer in 1858 public works department pwd was created and put into operation the pwd tried to induce kudimaramat people s maintenance through free labour by enacting laws to make it mandatory five successive irrigation acts were passed to try to force farmers to maintain the tanks vani 1992 but government kept asserting its own powers by saying that the maintenance of the tanks is the obligation of the villagers but not their right in 1920 the madras village panchayat act was passed and tank irrigation was handed over to panchayats 6 6 lowest administrative structure in india under this act panchayats were given few powers including the right to enforce kudimaramat this also was not successful because the government did not give the panchayats the right to tax citizens for public works during british period irrigation was treated primarily as a means to protect crops from drought irrigation systems were designed to provide small amounts of water over large areas randhawa 1983 since independence indian engineers have followed the same principles designed by the british maloney and raju 1994 and sengupta 1991 have documented the farmer management of tank irrigation in south india in the case of large scale canal systems it was assumed that farmers would take responsibility for management and often the construction of the lower levels of the irrigation systems specifically the channels below the outlet stone 1984 chambers 1988 the central and state governments of independent india inherited the idea that most water rights belong to the state stone 1984 this trend has changed in recent years where many state governments have adopted the principle of participatory irrigation management pim through government orders the command area development cad programme in the year 1973 became the major effort towards improving water use efficiency and productivity of irrigated agriculture sivamohan and scott 1994 according to wade 1978 irrigated agriculture specialists felt that the greatest opportunities lay in improving the portions of irrigation systems managed by farmers i e below the outlet therefore wuas is one of the elements included in the cad recognizing the importance of users in management to solve the main problems faced by the government in managing the irrigation systems some states adopted participatory management policies though the policies differed from state to state reddy et al 2002 in ap all tanks that have command area of more than 50 ha were brought under wuas and more than 80 per cent of the 10 000 wuas formed in ap pertain to tanks 3 tank rehabilitation 3 1 rationale the rationale for tank restoration is valid not only from the equity and stability points but also from the economic angle for per unit costs of restoration are marginal compared to creating new irrigation systems canal or tank moreover most of the river basins are approaching their irrigation potential and any further expansion in area under irrigation has to come from rain water harvesting adb 2006 that is future food security is critically linked to protecting and strengthening these structures tank restoration has another important benefit in terms of groundwater replenishment there are two ways of restoring these traditional systems one is restoring them to the old type for providing direct irrigation and another is to convert them into pts though both of them have advantages and disadvantages percolation tanks pts seem to perform better in terms of productivity on the other hand irrigation tanks are more equitous more investments and fallow up measures are required to safeguard equity in pts research on costs and benefits of rehabilitating irrigation tanks made it clear that benefits outweigh costs in all situations irrespective of tank size though benefits are proportional to the size of the tanks palanisam 2005 reddy and behera 2009a 2009b kumar et al 2011 recharging of groundwater appears to be one of most pressing reasons for tank restoration given the fact that groundwater is the single largest source of irrigation in most parts of india it is observed that in the absence of replenishing mechanisms like tanks or canals water supply available from wells is much limited in most regions open wells have dried up and water levels go down rapidly in the deep borewells in the absence of well managed tanks in the vicinity especially during the low rainfall years reddy 2005 and whenever canals tanks do not get adequate supply the wells located in the vicinity get poor recharge and the independent wells get almost negligible recharge due to low rainfall sivasubramaniyan 2006 this not only emphasises the rational for the revival of tanks but also points to the need for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources therefore restoring these systems will go a long way in addressing the issues of food security regional imbalances ecological balance etc while there is urgent need for policy intervention in this regard the need for managing these resources in a sustainable manner is equally important as these systems fall under cprs collective action is a prerequisite for their management traditionally local people through institutional arrangements managed these systems these traditional systems of resource management have degenerated over time due to the state interventions and due to the socio political and economic dynamics at the village level as a result irrigation under these water bodies too experienced a growing gap between capacities often created much before independence and the net area irrigated nia loss of capacity of the tanks is not only the loss of tank irrigation but also loss of groundwater recharge in the tank dominant regions which are relatively dry and drought prone and dependent on wells as much reddy 1998 reddy and behera 2009a in fact the increase in well irrigation is identified as the single most important factor responsible for the collective management of tank systems in tamil nadu in recent years kajisa et al 2006 aubriot and prabhakar 2011 institutional arrangements such as dasabandam and kudimaramat in south sagar rakshya jagir in the east were in place to protect these systems from decay under dasabandam or jagir tank lands were created and given to a person in the village poligars for the purpose of maintaining the tank under kudimaramat 7 7 though kudimaramat is argued to be the creation of british rulers in order to shift the burden of tank management to local communities it was observed that community management of tanks was mostly governed by the village power structure mosse 1999 community voluntarily participates in maintaining the tank it was observed that the government of madhya pradesh was managing the tanks better even during 1950s with institutional arrangements like payment parch pani system shah 2003 distributional equity was maintained as the tail enders get the water first under this system which was imposed by the government chowkidar it is observed that the changing socio economic and policy context is not conducive for collective or community management of tank systems if the community based tank management systems were controlled by the village power structures mosse 1999 then these power structures no longer exist nor wield any power to manage the systems even the community based institutions like kudimaramat are no longer attractive due to the availability of non farm employment increased employment opportunities within the village such as watershed development wsd employment guarantee programmes etc koichi 2011 therefore the present policy orientation of focused on participatory development may not be appropriate these approaches need to orient themselves with the changing socio economic and market contexts and consequent dependence of the local communities and their conflicting interests pertaining to the tank systems evolution of efficient institutions is often linked to the local community s perceptions and dependence on the resource that is being addressed unless the needs and linkages of local communities with tank systems are understood in a broader context the tank restoration programmes may not achieve the objectives it was observed that tanks in rajasthan despite their degraded status still serve number of purposes of the local communities and rehabilitating them to their previous status may adversely affect the livelihoods of those who are presently benefiting from them shah and raju 2002 for instance the inundation irrigation practiced at present protects the interests of tank bed farmers as well as command area farmers renovating the tanks by desilting canal lining treatment of catchment area may go against the interest of the tank bed farmers while it benefits the command area farmers similarly fishing is increasingly becoming economically more viable in north and east india restoring such tanks to the previous state in order to protect the irrigation benefits may result in conflict of interest in the case of south indian tanks well owners have become an important stakeholder group ignoring the importance of groundwater recharge and conjunctive use in the south indian tanks may aggravate the conflicts between command area farmers and groundwater farmers 3 2 tank rehabilitation and modernisation programmes tank rehabilitation programmes were initiated during the early 1980s though bilateral agencies like european economic community eec world bank and ford foundation have supported rehabilitation programmes in states like tamil nadu ngos such as professional assistance for development action pradan and tarun bharat sangh tbs in rajasthan gram vikas in karnataka development of human action dhan foundation in tamil nadu and ap society for promotion of wastelands development spwd in different states have also initiated programmes to revive these traditional systems state governments were not only partners in the large initiatives but also initiated large tank renovation programmes on their own with the support from bilateral agencies like world bank during 2004 05 tank rehabilitation got the specific attention at the national level only after two decades of efforts in various states a pilot scheme for revival restoration and rehabilitation rrr of water bodies to augment the storage capacities and to recover or extend irrigation potential was initiated at the national level working committee of the planning commission recommended about rs 70 000 million us 2 33 33 million the pilot scheme envisaged a plan outlay of rs 3000 million us 100 million to be shared by central government and state governments in the ratio of 3 1 and covers the water bodies with an irrigation potential of 40 ha to 2000 ha initially the scheme was for a short period of two years though planned to link it with the programmes like national rural employment guarantee programme nregp and the bharat nirman tamil nadu karnataka ap maharashtra odisha and rajasthan are among the first states all undertaking rehabilitation and reforms with the help of national and international aid one of the first tank rehabilitation 8 8 rehabilitation was focused on desilting and strengthening the bunds and weirs programmes was piloted in tamil nadu with the financial support from ford foundation in 1984 eec and government of india goi have signed an agreement to rehabilitate 210 tanks while the phase i of the programme was completed in 1989 the phase ii was completed in 1996 covering about 44 000 ha of command area adb 2006 world bank had supported rehabilitation of 620 tanks under its water resources consolidation project wrcp national bank for agriculture and rural development nabard also provided support for 109 tanks in two phases altogether 11 034 tanks have been rehabilitated under different programmes in tamil nadu karnataka has its community based tank management project kcbtmp started in 2002 to rehabilitate 2000 irrigation tanks through community participation on pilot basis the government of karnataka gok constituted an autonomous body called the jala samvardhane yojana sangha jsys to oversee the entire task adb 2006 the project had three components i providing enabling environment for the sustainable decentralized tank management systems ii strengthening community based institutions to take up development and management activities and iii undertake system improvements the purpose is to rehabilitate the tanks and hand them over to the tank user associations tuas there are 57 cluster facilitation teams ngos working with the project a significant number of women and traditionally marginalized communities are involved and represented in the project thinksoft 2006 the maharashtra government has undertaken similar project called the maharashtra minor irrigation project mmip the project envisaged improvements to minor irrigation tanks weirs diversion weirs storage weirs bhandars and lift irrigation schemes with participation of farmers in management and operation the project components provided support for institutional reforms and capacity building in water resources management wrm irrigation service delivery and complementary investments in improving and modernizing physical assets pani panchayats would be established in the post implementation phase to ensure equitable water distribution among the farmers thinksoft 2006 the odisha water resources consolidation project owrcp was initiated with world bank assistance in 1996 its components included scheme completions systems improvement and farmer participation basin planning and environmental action plan water resources research and agricultural intensification institutional reorganization and strengthening resettlement and rehabilitation and development plan of the indigenous people pani panchayats were created to deal with tank level issues like water distribution conflict resolutions etc thinksoft 2006 this is part of the major water sector reforms in the state european union has provided support for rehabilitating 47 tanks in1997 with a focus on repairing distribution channels apart from some support funding from nabard adb 2006 ap is the first state to initiate irrigation sector reforms in india under these reforms all the tank systems with more than 45 ha of command area were brought under water user associations wuas which are expected to rehabilitate and manage the systems however since the reform focus was not tank rehabilitations tank wuas suffered due to limited funding available for rehabilitation reddy and reddy 2002 a new initiative named the andhra pradesh community based tank management project apcbtmp envisaged rehabilitating around 3000 tank systems with an estimated command area of about 2 50 000 ha the ultimate development objective is to improve tank system based livelihoods and strengthen community management of the selected tank systems main components of the project include i strengthening community based institutions for system improvement and management ii livelihoods support services for tank system users and iii post implementation project management this is a 5 year programme covering 3000 tanks in three phases national framework guidelines have been used to select the tanks for rehabilitation the criteria include a tanks irrigating 75 per cent of the area irrigated using at two stage selection and b incidence of poverty at the mandal level and having cropping intensity of less than state average in the case of tank cascades the entire cascade is to be taken up for rehabilitation thinksoft 2006 the newly formed telangana state has embarked on an ambitious tank rehabilitation programme viz mission kakatiya under this programme it is planning to restore 9306 tanks every year 20 of total tanks with an eventual target of restoring all 46 531 tanks in 5 years in a phased manner to bring 0 45 million ha in to command main activities include de silting repairing of sluices weirs etc strengthening of tank bunds repairing the feeder channels and re sectioning of irrigation channels rajasthan also has initiated tank rehabilitation along with its water sector reform project supported by the world bank viz water resources consolidation project wrcp another project supported by german bank for development reconstruction kfw envisaged rehabilitation and modernisation of 1198 large tanks over a period of 10 years like the ap model the irrigation reforms in rajasthan also tank user associations were organised to facilitate a improved utilisation of potential created b better operation and maintenance of the systems and c equitable reliable and efficient distribution of water etc raju and shah 2000 4 impact of tank rehabilitation none of the rehabilitation programmes across india has taken up a comprehensive rehabilitation of the systems the most comprehensive among them is the world bank supported ones where the activities included strengthening earthen bunds reconstruction of totally damaged sluices repairing surplus weirs rehabilitating supply channels and drainage channels repairing canal structures and selective lining of channels the focus of european community ec project was to rehabilitate the distribution system and transfer the management to wuas after providing adequate training on all aspects with specific emphasis on o m lining of field channels up to tertiary level and improvement of catchment drains to harvest rainwater was the focus of nabard funded projects on the contrary ngos supported mainly desilting and increasing tank capacity activities one common activity among all the programmes is to encourage beneficiary participation in fact community participation considered as the most important component that would ensure effective and sustainable impacts impact assessment of the rehabilitation programmes are also limited to specific activities there are very few research studies that have comprehensively assessed the impacts of the programme in terms of cost benefit analysis adb 2006 reddy and behera 2009b however a few studies have attempted cost benefit analysis of a limited number of tanks the focus of the impact studies has been on the improved availability water which is critical for determining the tank performance better availability of water in turn influences area under irrigation cropping pattern yield rates livestock fodder employment distribution of water etc palanisami et al 2008 the ngo experiments in tank rehabilitation have also emphasised livelihoods aspects of tank dependent communities adb 2006 some studies however have assessed the performance of tanks in general kumar et al 2011 or linked to institutional arrangements sakthivadivel et al 2004 though these studies have not assessed the impact of rehabilitation they provide insights in to the likely impact of tanks when they are fully functional asian development bank adb has compiled evidence on the impact of tank rehabilitation programmes in various states like tamil nadu pondicherry karnataka and odisha these programmes were funded by various agencies like eec world bank nabard ngos etc the main activities include repairs to main irrigation drainage channels lining of main irrigation channels restructuring of tank sluices and weir desilting of supply channels and tank beds improvement to catchment areas on farm development works land grading and shaping and construction of periphery bunds embankments these activities were carried out selectively in different regions rather than on each system the evidence overwhelmingly supports the positive impact of tank rehabilitation programmes across the states this is obvious because in most cases rehabilitation is in the form of improved storage water distribution systems etc which have helped increase in area under irrigation an additional social benefit is the equitable distribution of water viz improved availability of water to the tail end plots which are mostly owned by marginal farmers it is observed that canal lining has resulted in water savings to the tune of 21 per cent adb 2006 the favourable impacts are also due to the methodology adopted by these studies viz using the before and after situations as against using with and without situation moreover most of these studies do not address the long term sustainability of the programme when a more systematic assessment is followed the impacts are found to be moderate especially in the major initiatives like the eec programme in tamil nadu palanisami et al 2008 this study comparing 25 eec modernised tanks with 25 non eec tanks observed no significant differences in the performance water availability yield rates incomes etc between these two groups of tanks the main reason for this is the absence of fallow up maintenance activities in the programme tanks where the systems were going back to pre programme status this clearly raises the sustainability of the rehabilitation programmes in the absence of budgetary provision for fallow up maintenance this is also reflected in other studies as where a major complaint from the farmers was that in most of the rehabilitated systems rehabilitation is treated as a one time activity and after the programme is closed neither the implementing agency nor the funding agency revisits the system to provide advice and or to carry out minor modifications and repairs if any adb 2006 on the other hand some of the ngo implemented programmes are observed to have performed better in terms of impacts and sustainability when compared to control tank systems reddy and behara 2009a number of studies has reported substantial improvements in productivity crop intensity employment livestock production etc besides availability of fuel wood also increased in most of the study tanks improved groundwater recharge is another important impact of tank rehabilitation rehabilitation has benefited both drinking water and irrigation wells in the command area and beyond the augmented recharge directly benefits the land owning households and indirectly benefits the poor and landless through an increase in employment days water markets have become active and provided access to water even to the poor improved access to drinking water helps reducing the drudgery of women and children and improves quality of life at the same time extensive canal lining reduced groundwater recharge in fact use of tank storage for artificial recharge at times of scarcity using tank as percolation pond is fast catching up in karnataka where orchards and cash crops are replacing cereal crops and crop diversification is taking place under well irrigation adb 2006 the activity of lining could become a conflict of interest between well owning and command area farmers another important area of impact and conflict is the desilting of tanks which is carried out in most of the ngo programmes and not in large donor funded rehabilitation programmes apart from improving the water storage capacity of the tank application of tank silt to farm lands contributes to the land productivity in a study of tank rehabilitation in ap it was observed that yield increases range between 20 and 40 per cent due to silt application davuluri nd it also reduced the use of chemical fertilizers by about 50 60 per cent compared to earlier years desilting of tank and application of tank silt to farm lands on a regular basis is a traditional practice from the economic point of view it was estimated in the case of karnataka desilting is viable if there is market for silt gireesh et al 1997 of late carrying out desilting activities is becoming difficult not due to economic reasons but due to shortage or lack of willingness on the part of labour to engage in such hard work and there are not many takers for silt due to transportation costs in the absence of demand for silt it is often dumped outside the tank which gets in to tank with the first rains given the high costs coupled with the problems of disposal partial desiltation is recommended in the case of tamil nadu palanisami et al 2010 it is also proposed that desilting can be combined with social forestry which is practiced on tank beds in tamil nadu in order to get twin benefits the rate of return is estimated at 8 per cent from this combined activity this would ensure benefits from enhanced storage capacity of the tank as well as the benefits of social forestry on the tank beds palanisami et al 2010 low sustainability of tank rehabilitation in most regions is giving rise to the demand for pts especially in the regions with high well density in the command area pts apart from recharging groundwater improves availability of water for human and livestock for longer periods and also facilitates fishing activities though not many tanks are designed for percolation most of the tanks that are in disrepair function like pts in a study of tamil nadu it was observed that half of the defunct tanks function as pts by default palanisami and meinzen dick 2001 from economic angle also the conversion to pts is more beneficial net returns per hectare when tanks used purely for irrigation purely for percolation and mixed ones are compared palanisami and amarasinghe 2008 and such conversions are more conducive for small tanks under panchayat raj institutions pris however pts may adversely impact the distributional equity as some of the farmers depending on low cost flow irrigation may be deprived if they do not have capacity to invest in borewells reddy and behara 2009a it was observed in a study of tamil nadu that only 15 per cent of the farmers have wells and there is potential to increase the numbers by 25 per cent palanisami and amarasinghe 2008 this in turn may lead to conflict of interest between well owners and non well owners in one such situation where farmers in the command area who do not own wells raised objections for conversion of tanks the problem was amicably resolved with an arrangement for assured water sharing between farmers with wells and those without wells that is farmers without wells pay one third of their harvest to the farmers with wells for supplying water for their fields davuluri nd however the situation is fast changing as more and more farmers including small and marginal are investing in borewells with the declining cost of well irrigation reddy 2005 besides the improved employment avenues at the village and the surrounding areas has helped checking migration to a large extent adb 2006 palanisami et al 2008 reddy and behara 2009a at the same time these opportunities are also proving detrimental in terms of peoples participation in the tank rehabilitation activities in fact even agricultural operations are getting effected especially after the advent of nregp that assures employment for 100 days in a year which is preferred by the communities for nregp is treated as welfare programme rather than an employment programme i e good wages with less effort reddy 2011 the participatory approach adopted in the rehabilitation programmes has some social impacts as well these include equal participation of socially disadvantaged sections like scheduled castes scs as members in the executive committees this is mainly due to the representative and democratic approach of electing member to committees adb 2006 this has given the much needed voice to these communities another social impact pertains to the reduced gender differences in wage rates due to the implementation of equal wage rule in most programmes including wsd besides women participation and membership has been made mandatory in some of the recent reforms like wuas participatory institutions have become mandatory for any rehabilitation programme as the initial assessments of the rehabilitation programmes have identified the absence of peoples participation as the reason for poor impacts adb 2006 in a study of 41 tanks spread over 22 districts in 8 states observed that techno institutional mechanisms are central to most of the best performing tanks across the country sakthivadivel et al 2004 participation is not only in terms of mandatory labour for cleaning up the feeder channels and distributaries and user contribution but also for negotiating with the neighbouring and village communities these negotiations help in evicting the encroachment of tank bed and feeder channels in one of the eec projects in tamil nadu the farmers of the down stream tank negotiated with the up stream farmers to do repairs and improvement works for their feeder channel so that downstream tank can get more water the agreement was that downstream tank community allocate funds for upstream farmers in one of the tanks in odisha new channels to harvest more rainwater from the watershed were created by the community through voluntary labour it may be noted that most of the impact assessment studies are partial in their assessments as they have neither included all the tank uses and benefits in their analysis nor taken the environmental and social impacts in to account even when multiple uses like irrigation drinking water livestock fishing etc are considered studies have limited their analysis to economic values as measuring the social impacts are difficult though environmental impacts can be assessed the estimation procedures are cumbersome despite the partial assessment benefits from tank rehabilitation outweigh the costs in most cases these benefits could be enhanced further through reallocation of available water between crops seasons and activities kumar et al 2011 however how long these benefits sustain in the absence of post implementation financial and institutional support is a moot point it was observed even in the ngo implemented rehabilitation programmes over time peoples participation was limited to monetary contribution forcing the management committee mc to contract out the works davuluri nd as a result there were allegations of misappropriation of funds by the mc and the committee became defunct soon after the implementation and no efforts were made to revive the old committee or elect a new one leaving tank without any formal body to look after the regular maintenance 5 climate change and tank rehabilitation the major impacts of climate change are likely to occur through water climate change predictions of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc for south asia indian region indicated 0 5o c 1 2o c increase in temperature by 2020 ipcc 2007 rainfall pattern is also likely to change in terms of distribution and intensity while agriculture as a whole is expected to be mostly negatively affected rain fed agriculture where tank irrigation is concentrated in particular is expected to be impacted differently under the climate change ipcc 2007 rain fed agriculture may have unexpected changes in its crop compositions and crop calendar as the pattern and structure of climatic variables may change these unexpected changes could sometimes be beneficial when they are internalised but mostly these impacts become cascading due to the various socio economic changes taking place in these regions increasing commercialization changes in gender and age composition of working farmers and lack of educated farmers in agriculture increasing labour costs and declining labour productivity are some of the changes that complicate the situation on the ground the cascading impact of all these changes accentuated by the climate variability seems to be driving the fortunes of the rain fed farmers more importantly the farming communities and institutions are unable to foresee these impacts and adequately prepare themselves to face the challenges on the other hand some of the states in the indo gangetic plains such as uttar pradesh and bihar may experience floods due to ice melt different regions may experience different kinds of water stress overall the demand for water is likely to increase especially during rabi november february season incidence of prolonged droughts and frequent floods may increase in the coming years conservation of moisture and water storage becomes critical for adapting to such climate changes tank systems should be designed in such a way that they can with stand and help mitigate the extreme situations this calls for a systematic and comprehensive approach tank systems should be made part of the overall water policy as observed in most of the states canal irrigation tank irrigation and well irrigation are considered and treated as separate entities though some states like ap brought tank systems under wuas their approach to rehabilitating and managing these systems falls short of requirements reddy and reddy 2002 in the context of increased temperatures storage of water in sub surface aquifers assumes importance to reduce evaporation rates and tanks need to be connected to canal systems wherever possible in order to face water shortages and severe droughts on the other hand interlinking of tanks cascading becomes critical in the event of excess precipitation and floods this is possible only with a comprehensive approach of integrating the three sources of irrigation in a river basin or watershed context rainfall forecasts should be effectively used to predict likely nature of tank filling non systems tanks should be converted into system tanks by linking the canal river systems wherever possible so that surplus water during heavy rains can be diverted to the tanks easily the tank chain should be restored to facilitate for the diversion of water from upstream us tanks to downstream tanks ds in all the future government spending programs on tanks this should be made compulsory while an integrated approach is necessary across the country the requirements of the systems could differ from region to region depending on the changes or expected changes in climatic conditions for instance the need and extent of desilting and the need for conversion of irrigation tanks in to pts may vary from region to region palanisami et al 2010 regular monitoring of climate as well as hydrological data at appropriate scale is a prerequisite for sustainable resource management srm at present climate as well as hydrology variables are measured at the block or sub district level this scale of observation does not reflect the village level reality making the information totally irrelevant to the farmer establishment of rain gauge and hydrological monitoring stations need to be at the village level and surface hydrology monitoring should be carried out for each tank system in a river basin these systems are neither costly nor difficult to handle by the communities reddy 2012 such information would help in identifying appropriate activities and investments in the context of climate change for instance partial desilting and increase in well density are observed to be more appropriate in the context of tamil nadu tank systems in order to cope with the impact of climate change in the future palanisami et al 2010 similarly tanks connected to canals system tanks are expected to provide more opportunities for improvement compared to non system tanks palanisami and rosegrant 1995 as quoted in palanisami et al 2010 generation of technical information at appropriate scale is a prerequisite for policy planning in the context of climate change 6 conclusions and strategies for policy traditional water harvesting systems like tanks are integral to agricultural development livelihoods of rural communities though the importance of these systems varies across regions and states of india they serve number of critical and strident purposes like provision of drinking water protective irrigation etc the evidence from number of research studies across the regions is unequivocal in saying that the benefits from tank rehabilitation outweigh the costs therefore the policy initiatives to restore irrigation tanks are rational as far as achieving the objective of improving rural livelihoods and alleviating poverty in drought prone regions is concerned scaling up of tank rehabilitation at the national and state level is critical for substantial benefits to the local communities despite two decades of efforts in various states the proportion of tanks rehabilitated is less than ten per cent of the defunct tanks perhaps same number if not more of tanks may be falling in to disrepair every year therefore the efforts and allocations towards tank rehabilitation needs to be increased many fold though the review clearly shows that number of activities go in to tank rehabilitation all the activities in a comprehensive manner are taken up only in a few cases each programme funder has its priority of interventions moreover the priorities may not be same in all the regions nor they suit the local conditions for tank uses benefits users or stakeholders differ from region to region hence tank rehabilitation strategies ought to be specific to the regional requirements in what follows we present some general strategies common to all the regions although the immediate benefits of tank restoration are conspicuous sustaining these benefits in the long run is the crux of the problem this aspect needs to be given due importance while scaling up the programme especially by government agencies this calls for major policy initiatives at the national as well as state level these include 1 there is need for a comprehensive approach to water resources planning integrating canals tanks and groundwater policy should treat the three sources of irrigation as complementary to each rather than considering them as substitutes that is all the three sources of irrigation need to be brought under a management regime at watershed or river basin scale 2 technical aspects like geo hydrology soils land use etc need to be made part of planning while designing tank rehabilitation 3 generation of climate and hydrological information at an appropriate scale should be given high priority at the national level some states are already planning to establish low cost rain gauge stations at the village level 4 allocations towards tank rehabilitation need to be enhanced in order to fasten the pace of rehabilitation financing of tank rehabilitation needs to be changed to asset based planning instead of the one time programme based approach in order to ensure sustainability of the tank systems in the long run this could be done following a life cycle cost approach lca where capital asset management is part of project costing this would help in enhancing the benefits from the livelihood and income support policies such as fishery dairy and other allied activities 5 this calls for permanent institutional arrangements that have constitutional validity as well as linkages and manage the tanks on a continuous basis this would have double impact of managing the structures in a more systematic manner and using the fund flows efficiently 6 the present participatory approach seems to over emphasise the voluntary participation this may no longer be feasible in the changing socio economic and policy context constitutionally recognised institutional arrangements with incentive and disincentives mechanisms in place could be the way forward 7 addressing the equity concerns especially relating to groundwater in the context of pts is one of the important concerns number of experiments like andhra pradesh farmers managed groundwater systems apfmags well sharing and social regulation is going on in various states reddy et al 2014 lessons drawn from such experiments could help scaling up of equitable and sustainable groundwater management and 8 though multiple uses of tank systems are not new the economics of various activities like fishing are changing these changing or new demands of the community

11337,traditional water harvesting tank systems are integral to agricultural development and livelihoods of rural communities in india despite the fact that these systems provide number of services drinking water protective irrigation etc their importance and contribution declined during the post independence india population pressure along with poor maintenance have led to their deterioration for instance the number tanks not in use has doubled between 2000 01 and 2010 11 the share of tank irrigation in to total irrigation in india declined from 17 to 2 5 between 1950 51 and 2014 15 realising the multiple benefits from theses traditional systems tank rehabilitation has been one of the policy priorities at the central as well as in some states this paper is a review of experiences on tank systems and their rehabilitation across the regions of india the idea is to explore the variations in tank systems across the regions and identify specific approaches for strengthening and promoting them tank uses benefits users or stakeholders differ from region to region hence the priorities may not be same in all the regions the evidence across the regions indicates that the benefits from tank rehabilitation outweigh the costs it is argued that scaling up of tank rehabilitation at the national and state level is critical for providing substantial benefits to the local communities while the policy initiatives to restore irrigation tanks are rational the interventions need to be based on the changing conditions in terms of groundwater development and climate variability in the specific regions keywords tank rehabilitation irrigation management participatory india 1 introduction in india age old water harvesting and storage systems such as tanks and ponds are becoming things of the past because of lack of any sort of maintenance by the state or civil society these traditional systems have degenerated overtime because of unwarranted interventions by the state and changing socio economic and political conditions at the village level as a result area under tank irrigation has declined substantially at the all india level i e 3 6 million hectares 17 in 1950 51 to 1 7 million hectares 2 5 in 2014 15 1 1 compiled from the directorate of economics and statistics for different years ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare government of india figures are provisional for the year 2014 15 though the extent of deterioration varies across states cwc 2010 this declining capacity of the tanks has not only led to loss of area under irrigation but also groundwater recharge in the tank dominated regions that are relatively dry drought prone and dependent on wells as tanks improve recharge by 40 per cent meter et al 2016 well irrigation recorded a phenomenal rise especially during 1970s and 1980s and moved from second to the first position in terms of area irrigated by a single source this has in turn created considerable imbalance in the ecological and social systems of the country declining tank irrigation and expansion of groundwater irrigation are observed across india especially in the drought prone regions the literature identifies numerous socio economic institutional and physical reasons for the decline of tank irrigation von oppen and rao 1980a reddy 1990 1995 shankari 1991 janakarajan 1993 reddy et al 1993 palanisami 2006 and 2008 palanisami et al 2011 nehlin 2016 the decline in tank irrigation has been linked with increasing population density von oppen and rao 1980b it has also been linked to the development of well irrigation palanisami 2006 for the decline in benefits from community based technology sources tanks has prompted people to shift towards individual based technology sources wells this however connotes a wrong notion of substitutability between tank and well irrigation particularly because tanks complement groundwater development in reality the decline of traditional systems therefore is a cumulative effect of policy and institutional neglect in the pre independence past before 1947 institutional arrangements such as dasabandam and kudimaramat of south india aher pyne systems of south bihar chandeli tanks of bhundelkh and johads and pals of rajasthan were in place to protect these systems from decay these institutional arrangements nurtured by the benevolent local rulers have been central to development and sustenance of the tank systems over centuries however the policy shift towards major and medium irrigation 2 2 major irrigation schemes are those with a culturable command irrigated area of 10 000 hectares and medium irrigation schemes are those with 2 000 to 10 000 hectares during the british period coupled with the changes in policy perception of irrigation development that is treating irrigation as a productive revenue generating source rather than a protective source has resulted in the degeneration of these institutions in addition overall environmental degradation especially in drought prone regions has led to silting up of tanks and shrinking of their capacities this in turn has led to the shift towards private well irrigation declining tank irrigation and expansion of well irrigation were slowed down towards the end of the british period and the slow down continued until the 1980s the second phase of the tank systems decline was triggered by the advent of the energization of groundwater lifting mechanisms the new technologies in pumping systems during the1980s coupled with the benefits from green revolution technology have resulted in an unprecedented expansion of groundwater development further poor farmers were not in a position to adopt these technologies because of their capital intensive nature especially during the initial stages due to over exploitation oe a large number of open wells have started drying up in drought prone regions in fact well failure including borewells has become a common phenomenon in the recent past as the policies have been passive realising the importance of protecting and sustaining these systems tank rehabilitation programmes have been initiated by the state governments bi lateral agencies and non governmental organisations ngos in number of states reddy 2015 of late tank rehabilitation and modernisation has been initiated at the national level with budgetary allocations while rehabilitation is defined as bringing back the systems to their original technical form modernisation is defined as upgradation of the systems with modern infrastructure and management shah and raju 2002 modernization thus also involves institutional arrangements for managing the systems in fact management is increasingly becoming critical for rehabilitating the systems for in the absence of appropriate and effective institutional arrangements investing in rehabilitation may not be a viable proposition therefore rehabilitation and modernisation could involve number of activities such as strengthening the bund sluice repair de silting treatment of catchment repairs to feeder channels and irrigation canals institutional arrangements etc some of these activities are taken up in the rehabilitation programmes though institutional aspects are gaining importance in the recent years although there is every reason to protect and strengthen these traditional systems it needs to be based on the region specific nature and importance of tank systems for tank systems differ in their size extent functionality management etc from region to region and hence requires specific approaches for their rehabilitation and management in a sustainable manner the economic viability of tanks given their scale is crucial for the communities to realize their importance in improving their livelihoods tanks being common pool resources cprs collective action is a prerequisite to manage them in a sustainable manner this becomes important in the context of the changing socio economic and political scenario this paper is an attempt to explore the variations in tank systems across the regions and identify specific approaches for strengthening and promoting them across regions specific objectives include a assess the extent and importance of tank systems across the four regions north south east and west b examine the various tank management practices across these regions c examine various tank rehabilitation interventions and their impacts in different regions and d suggest appropriate tank rehabilitation strategies in the changing socio economic environmental and policy context this paper is based on the literature available across the states and provides a meta analysis of various aspects this paper is organised in six sections after the introductory section one the following section two presents the status of tank irrigation across the four regions of the country and sets the priorities for tank rehabilitation in these regions section three provides the rationale and importance of tank rehabilitation interventions section four discusses the impact of tank rehabilitation programmes the importance and nature of tank rehabilitation in the changing environmental and policy context is discussed in section five and the last section six makes some concluding remarks and suggests region specific policy options 2 status and profile of tank irrigation across regions in india 2 1 extent of tank irrigation all the major states and union territories uts in india are grouped under five regions as per the planning commission viz south north east and west table 1 north eastern states are not included here as there are no studies available for this region research on tank irrigation is mainly focused on south east and western regions and very few studies are available from northern states this could be due to the relative importance of tank irrigation in these regions or states irrigated area under tanks has been declining since 1950 51 while all other sources have recorded an increase fig 1 the minor irrigation 3 3 minor irrigation schemes are those with less than 2000 ha of culturable command irrigated area mi census carried out by the ministry of water resources mowr provide the information on tanks at the state level every five years since 1986 87 but only 2010 11 mi census are the latest available 4 4 the data are released with a lag of 3 5 years the 2016 17 census data are likely to be available by 2020 at the latest even the data provided in these censuses are not consistent over the years only in one year 2000 01 number of tanks in use is given separately while in other years tanks are given under surface water flows which includes canal irrigation as well these two figures are not comparable as tanks in use account for less than 50 per cent of the surface water flows and the 50 per cent decline between 1986 87 and 2000 01 in some studies pant and verma 2009 is not real fig 2 over the years there is an increase in the number of tanks from 0 5 million in 1986 87 to 0 64 million in 2000 01 and then they declined to 0 6 million in 2006 07 this may be due to watershed development programmes wsdp after the 1990s under which number of surface water bodies are being created among the regions north and west have recorded an increase while south and east reported decline in surface water bodies between 1986 87 and 2006 07 in the absence of accurate data across all the states the number of tanks and ponds in india are reported to vary between 0 2 to 0 35 million adb 2006 the number of tanks in use assessed by the mi census in 2000 01 was 0 23 million in india fig 3 besides an estimated 42 955 tanks were not in use in 2000 01 which has gone up to 85 807 in 2010 11 5 5 these figures are provided by indiastat com the actual year of reference is not clear as the data was sourced from a parliament question in 2011 together this provides an estimate of number of tanks in the range of 0 3 million in india southern region accounts for 35 per cent of the total tanks in use in india 2000 01 followed by west 20 east 16 and north 14 east has the highest proportion of tanks not in use 21 471 out of 42 740 in 2010 11 followed by south 35 742 out of 102 991 in 210 11 west and north the high density of tanks in use as well as decayed tanks in south could be the reason for the focus the region received in terms of tank renovation programmes the variations in the density of tanks across states are basically due to geo hydrological topography and rainfall patterns the topography of deccan plateau south india with undulating topography and rocky substrata are ideal for locating tanks and gravity irrigation the geological formation of hard granite limits deep groundwater percolation warranting surface storage structures in case of the plains in south bihar and chota nagpur plateau tank irrigation is an outcome of the natural condition and physical configuration of the area and has been evolved to overcome the obstacles of irrigation adb 2006 on the other hand most of the north indian states have small ponds mainly for the purpose of inland fisheries though they are also used for irrigation purposes thus the density prominence and importance of the tank systems across the regions are critically linked to the natural and economic factors in the case of area under tank irrigation data are drawn from different sources and data are available till 2014 15 area under tank irrigation between 1972 and 2008 has declined steadily in north and south regions as well as at the all india level though there appears to be a sort of a revival between 2003 and 2008 fig 4 this could be due to the advent of tank rehabilitation programmes in some of the southern and eastern states over the last 3 decades area under tank irrigation has declined by 1 million hectares at the all india level of this more than 0 7 million hectares of area is from southern region consisting of ap tamil nadu karnataka and kerala the share of different regions in the total area under tanks has declined between 1972 and 2008 in south and north regions i e from 58 to 53 per cent in south and from 14 to 9 per cent in north fig 5 on the other hand the share of east has improved from 17 to 21 per cent and in west from 12 to 17 per cent over the period while south indian states account for 35 per cent of the total tanks in use they account for more than 50 per cent of the area as per 2008 data the four southern states account for 53 per cent of the total area under tanks in the country followed by east india states 21 west and north indian states relative importance of tank irrigation in overall irrigation has come down substantially over years at the all india level the share of tank irrigation has declined from 12 per cent in 1972 to 3 per cent in 2008 fig 6 within the respective regions also the importance of tank irrigation declined substantially over these years tank irrigation however holds relatively greater importance in south and east india states this could be one of the reasons for the attention these regions get in terms of tank rehabilitation initiatives whereas tank irrigation accounts for 5 per cent of total irrigated area in west and 1 per cent in the north indian states 2 2 nature of tank systems tanks are rainfall dependent and majority of the tank systems are located in arid and semi arid regions with high temperatures the weak relationship between rainfall and area under tank irrigation in states like tamil nadu could be due to degradation encroachment and urbanisation change in land use of the catchment areas of the systems and the declining dependence on tanks over the years especially after 1970s palanisami and easter 2000 jana et al 2012 narayanamoorthy and suresh 2016 that is run off is reduced or diverted from reaching the tanks tanks provide protective irrigation and the area covered is always more during the good rainfall years in fact in good rainfall years farmers grow two crops under tanks as the demand for water during kharif is low in such years palanisami et al 2008 in the recent years tail end farmers of the distribution system receive tank water only during good rainfall years the size of the tanks is influenced by the magnitude and distribution of rainfall accordingly size of tanks varies across the regions most of the tanks have the submergence water covered area of less than 5 ha pant and verma 2009 palanisami et al 2010 their command irrigated area is less than 50 ha in 80 per cent of the cases the ratio of submergence area to command area differs from 1 5 to 4 acres in southern and eastern states jharkhand has the lowest ratio of 1 5 on the other hand tanks in western states like rajasthan are described as bigger when compared to southern states tanks in rajasthan have a command area of more than 500 ha shah and raju 2002 this could be due to low and intensive rainfall in these regions i e less than 700 mm rainfall takes place in a few rainy days on the other hand in tamil nadu rainfall is distributed over a period of more than 6 months with an average annual rainfall of about 900 mm on the other hand eastern states of odisha bihar west bengal and jharkhand get fairly high rainfall of above 1000 mm due to the differences in rainfall and hydrogeology the south india tanks were interlinked cascading in order to store as much water as possible from the seasonal rains the ease of gravity irrigation in these regions has made them popular even among the policy makers over the years historically tanks have been constructed to store water in order to provide drinking water and protective irrigation during dry periods in some regions like bundelkhand the chandeli tanks were primarily built for recreation and domestic purpose and the numerous tanks in south were primarily built for protective irrigation purposes irrespective of the historical reasons the british have converted most of these tanks in to irrigation tanks in order to increase their agricultural revenues shah 2003 in eastern india majority of the tanks are multi purpose for domestic use irrigation and fish production though their primary purpose is irrigation adb 2006 pant and verma 2009 kumar et al 2011 jana et al 2012 tanks and ponds have been the primary source of water for poor rural households in eastern india including odisha recent research shows that they are being converted into fish ponds by local communities or panchayats this could be due to the declining viability of agriculture in general and specifically under tanks for inflows into the tanks have declined substantially in recent years due to the catchment interventions such as watershed programmes urbanisation etc though the tank systems have not been designed to facilitate multiple uses like domestic use fisheries livestock and irrigation the systems by default become a multiple use systems due to anthropogenic pressure while some of the unplanned uses may get absorbed by the system other uses can damage it van koppen et al 2009 often the competing water needs of the tanks results in conflicts between different users such as irrigators and fishermen in the process some of the strident needs like drinking water or livestock water needs face severe stress and the poor become the first victims in the process as they are kept out of the process in bundelkhand also tanks are being used for multi purposes though fishing seems to be the dominant activity of late shah 2003 irrespective of these direct or primary benefits tanks serve number of socio ecological purposes like soil and water conservation reduced run off groundwater recharge and enhanced resilience in the context of floods and drought provision of highly fertile silt etc some of these uses or benefits contradict the interests of primary beneficiaries like those getting low cost irrigation for instance in rajasthan the interests of farmers who cultivate the tank bed conflict with the interests of command irrigated area farmers shah and raju 2002 the purpose for which the tank is being used in the socio economic context is critical for the sustainability of the systems for instance if tanks provide substantial irrigation benefits in agrarian communities they are likely to be maintained better due to local interests in the case of bundelkhand greater economic benefits from fishing has prompted fishing groups taking more interest in taking over the tank management shah 2003 tanks in rajasthan are life savers in the arid conditions where rainfall occurs only for a few days in a year the main purposes of these tanks are protective irrigation soil and water conservation drinking water for human and livestock population livestock economy in rajasthan is as important if not more as agriculture these tanks help capture conserve and store the little but intensive rainfall the region receives and in the process reduce soil erosion by cutting the pace and momentum of run off waters the stored water is used for protective irrigation as well as helps recharge groundwater aquifers which provide a stable and reliable source of irrigation and domestic water supply tank silt provides the natural fertiliser for the degraded soils unlike large reservoirs and tanks in south india tank beds in rajasthan are used both for water storage as well as for cultivation as a rule farmers grow winter and sometimes summer crops in tank beds after they are emptied and the method of irrigation is different as the entire tank is emptied at one go to facilitate tank bed cultivation this is known as inundation irrigation which has its advantages and disadvantages apart from conflicting interests between tank bed and command area farmers shah and raju 2002 raju and shah 2000 2 3 tanks and groundwater there is a clear and close link between well irrigation and tank storage especially in areas with confined aquifers with rock stratum at 40 50 feet below ground shah and raju 2002 tanks by storing the runoff water for longer periods help recharging groundwater as a result well owners are an important stakeholder group of the tank systems they have conflicting interests with the command area farmers in most of the regions benefits from groundwater recharge have exceeded the direct irrigation benefits from the tanks in rajasthan the benefits from improved productivity of wells due to groundwater recharge extends beyond command and tank bed areas shah and raju 2002 this is even reflected in the increased land values beyond command area and hence considered as the most valuable benefit farmer s gain from the tanks this is mainly due to the decline in the capacity of tanks resulting in shrinking of command area in fact groundwater irrigation in the tank commands is more reliable due to good recharge and also available throughout the crop season in most cases tail end farmers mostly rely on groundwater due to unreliable water supplies from tanks a u shaped relationship between the number of private wells and tank degradation has been observed in tamil nadu balasubramanian and selveraj 2003 the interaction between tank irrigation surface water and groundwater levels is found to be strong in west bengal chowdhury and behera 2018 in tamila nadu it was observed that tanks helps in increasing the recharge by 40 percent kimberly et al 2016 it is argued that both tank irrigation and well irrigation should be used as complementary rather than substitutes in order to maintain a hydrological balance and manage water resources sustainably in the long run wells are also used as a mechanism to privatise cprs like tank water as a result percolation tanks pts are being preferred in place of irrigation tanks reddy and behera 2009a indeed there might be value in thinking of irrigation tanks primarily as pts designed to maximize groundwater recharge over as large an area around the tank as possible more importantly groundwater depth has improved substantially above 20 per cent in the case of restored tanks when compared with the control villages in rajasthan the practice of inundation irrigation helps recharge the aquifers and also helps top soils retain enough moisture for rabi crop apart from facilitating tank bed cultivation shah and raju 2002 the flooding also helps in filling the small upland ponds in the command area unlike in other states tank bed farmers are as important as command area farmers in rajasthan in fact tank bed farmers are more influential than the command area farmers given their control on water release and flooding of the command area raju and shah 2000 in this process while the tank bed farmers benefit from cultivating the tank bed with the available moisture command area farmers benefit from groundwater recharge tank bed farmers also use groundwater for protective irrigation purposes thus groundwater recharge is the main benefit from these tanks on the other hand groundwater development is limited under the tank systems in the east indian states like odisha and also in parts of tamil nadu groundwater irrigation is limited to open wells due to the viability of swallow aquifers and better rainfall conditions in the eastern regions in tamil nadu it was observed that there is potential to increase the well density by 25 per cent in the tank commands as only 15 per cent of the farmers have wells palanisami and amarasinghe 2008 despite the declining area under tank irrigation in recent years coupled with the declining groundwater conjunctive use of groundwater with tank water has not spread much this is often due to low productivity of agriculture resulting in low capacity of farmers to invest in bore wells this appears to be in contrast with other regions where tanks are abandoned due to the increased dependence on groundwater kajisa et al 2006 this has disturbed the ecological balance between surface groundwater dynamics in the context of eastern region where such balance seems to exist there is need to explore the hydrogeological aspects in order to promote sustainable conjunctive use of groundwater along with tank water it is observed that surface irrigation sources like tanks are more equitable when compared to groundwater this is mainly due to the riparian access to water and low cost nature of irrigation at the all india level area under tank irrigation has fluctuated between 1976 and 1991 but it has expanded at an annual rate of 1 4 per cent in the marginal farm 1 ha category and just by 0 1 per cent in the case of small farm 2 ha category goi 1992 in all other farms with a holding size of more than 2 ha tank irrigated area has declined and annual rate of decline varied from 0 9 per cent to 3 1 per cent despite the limited expansion of tank irrigated area its role in promoting equity cannot be ignored since the share of small and marginal farm holdings in the total farm holdings in the tank command area is very high as of now it was observed that poor farmers less than 2 ha still use a major share of tank irrigated area in india as their share in tank irrigated area has gone up from 40 per cent in 1970 71to 55 per cent in 1990 91 on the other hand the share of large farmers declined from 14 per cent to 6 per cent narayanamoorthy 2007 these trends hold good across different states where tank irrigation still has a considerable presence like ap and karnataka as large farmers are observed to be shifting to well irrigation besides irrigation poor households also depend more on tanks for various other uses such as livestock grazing fishery etc consequently poor households are observed to spend 100 per cent more labour than their on poor counterparts on tank maintenance activities balasubramanian and selveraj 2003 it was argued that the shift away from tank irrigation to groundwater irrigation may adversely impact equity due to the heavy investments required for well irrigation for poor farmers may not be able to make such lump sum investments this argument is often used against the conversion of irrigation tanks into pts reddy and behera 2009a but field research indicates that there is a structural change in the ownership of wells in the recent years it was observed that wells especially borewells are no longer privy to large farmers as more and more small and marginal farmers smf seem to be investing in bore wells this may be due to the availability of cheap quality pumps at lower prices during the recent years moreover farmers are forced to invest often with borrowed money in borewells due to the drying up of open wells reddy 2005 however availability of groundwater is critically linked with the sustainability of groundwater recharge 2 4 ownership and management in the indian context there is no historical evidence of construction and management of irrigation systems by farmers alone chanakya the author of arthashastra urged the rulers to assist the farmers in the construction of irrigation works besides extending various incentives during the period 13th 16th century in the vijayanagara empire now part of karnataka a series of tanks were built by rulers in which farmers participated voluntarily in the construction and maintenance though there were conflicts among the farmers similar is the case during the regime of chola now tamil nadu joshi 1997 tank systems across the country were built by benevolent rulers with some voluntary support from farmers and majority of the existing tank systems were constructed during pre british period during the colonial period irrigation was the exclusive responsibility of the civil engineering department the projects were conceived executed and managed as top down engineering projects stone 1984 in south india after the tanks were taken over by the state administration and a large number were in disuse due to neglect by the indigenous management of irrigation systems the british administration hardly conceived of communal or local water rights not just in india but also in other parts of the world irrespective of the ownership tanks are mostly used by communities across the country private ownership of tanks is greater at 37 per cent in the east indian states of bihar jharkhand odisha and west bengal though 83 per cent of the tanks have open access as far as use is concerned in west bengal 77 per cent of the tanks have open access despite the fact that it has the highest proportion of tanks 64 per cent under private ownership pant and verma 2009 however the pattern of ownership may have to be taken in to account while initiating tank rehabilitation programmes number of studies has observed that historically these systems have been managed on community basis across the country till the british rulers have interfered in their management in fact community management was promoted and supported by the rulers by providing incentives these incentives are in the form of rent free land to the families that take the responsibility of tank management these forms are known as dasabandam in the south sagar rakshya jagir in the east reddy 1990 and pant and verma 2009 for instance in himachal pradesh out of 1 00 000 ha of irrigated area 70 000 ha were managed by communal systems called khuls coward 1990 maharashtra has the long history of development and management of private irrigation schemes the irrigation department used to manage the state s canal systems and the basic irrigation management approach is called shejpali although alternatives exist it adopted a policy to create water user associations wuas at minor canal level with average command of 500 ha transfer operation maintenance o m responsibilities for the minor and smaller channels to the wuas allocate water to the wuas through five year agreements and charge wuas for water on the basis of the volume actually taken volumetric pricing the irrigation rights documented by the british era provide much of the social glue required for operating and sustaining these systems their cohesion now is dependent ultimately on property rights legitimised by the state rather than by local custom in madras an office of superintendent of tank repairs was formed in 1809 and staffed by a civil engineer in 1858 public works department pwd was created and put into operation the pwd tried to induce kudimaramat people s maintenance through free labour by enacting laws to make it mandatory five successive irrigation acts were passed to try to force farmers to maintain the tanks vani 1992 but government kept asserting its own powers by saying that the maintenance of the tanks is the obligation of the villagers but not their right in 1920 the madras village panchayat act was passed and tank irrigation was handed over to panchayats 6 6 lowest administrative structure in india under this act panchayats were given few powers including the right to enforce kudimaramat this also was not successful because the government did not give the panchayats the right to tax citizens for public works during british period irrigation was treated primarily as a means to protect crops from drought irrigation systems were designed to provide small amounts of water over large areas randhawa 1983 since independence indian engineers have followed the same principles designed by the british maloney and raju 1994 and sengupta 1991 have documented the farmer management of tank irrigation in south india in the case of large scale canal systems it was assumed that farmers would take responsibility for management and often the construction of the lower levels of the irrigation systems specifically the channels below the outlet stone 1984 chambers 1988 the central and state governments of independent india inherited the idea that most water rights belong to the state stone 1984 this trend has changed in recent years where many state governments have adopted the principle of participatory irrigation management pim through government orders the command area development cad programme in the year 1973 became the major effort towards improving water use efficiency and productivity of irrigated agriculture sivamohan and scott 1994 according to wade 1978 irrigated agriculture specialists felt that the greatest opportunities lay in improving the portions of irrigation systems managed by farmers i e below the outlet therefore wuas is one of the elements included in the cad recognizing the importance of users in management to solve the main problems faced by the government in managing the irrigation systems some states adopted participatory management policies though the policies differed from state to state reddy et al 2002 in ap all tanks that have command area of more than 50 ha were brought under wuas and more than 80 per cent of the 10 000 wuas formed in ap pertain to tanks 3 tank rehabilitation 3 1 rationale the rationale for tank restoration is valid not only from the equity and stability points but also from the economic angle for per unit costs of restoration are marginal compared to creating new irrigation systems canal or tank moreover most of the river basins are approaching their irrigation potential and any further expansion in area under irrigation has to come from rain water harvesting adb 2006 that is future food security is critically linked to protecting and strengthening these structures tank restoration has another important benefit in terms of groundwater replenishment there are two ways of restoring these traditional systems one is restoring them to the old type for providing direct irrigation and another is to convert them into pts though both of them have advantages and disadvantages percolation tanks pts seem to perform better in terms of productivity on the other hand irrigation tanks are more equitous more investments and fallow up measures are required to safeguard equity in pts research on costs and benefits of rehabilitating irrigation tanks made it clear that benefits outweigh costs in all situations irrespective of tank size though benefits are proportional to the size of the tanks palanisam 2005 reddy and behera 2009a 2009b kumar et al 2011 recharging of groundwater appears to be one of most pressing reasons for tank restoration given the fact that groundwater is the single largest source of irrigation in most parts of india it is observed that in the absence of replenishing mechanisms like tanks or canals water supply available from wells is much limited in most regions open wells have dried up and water levels go down rapidly in the deep borewells in the absence of well managed tanks in the vicinity especially during the low rainfall years reddy 2005 and whenever canals tanks do not get adequate supply the wells located in the vicinity get poor recharge and the independent wells get almost negligible recharge due to low rainfall sivasubramaniyan 2006 this not only emphasises the rational for the revival of tanks but also points to the need for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources therefore restoring these systems will go a long way in addressing the issues of food security regional imbalances ecological balance etc while there is urgent need for policy intervention in this regard the need for managing these resources in a sustainable manner is equally important as these systems fall under cprs collective action is a prerequisite for their management traditionally local people through institutional arrangements managed these systems these traditional systems of resource management have degenerated over time due to the state interventions and due to the socio political and economic dynamics at the village level as a result irrigation under these water bodies too experienced a growing gap between capacities often created much before independence and the net area irrigated nia loss of capacity of the tanks is not only the loss of tank irrigation but also loss of groundwater recharge in the tank dominant regions which are relatively dry and drought prone and dependent on wells as much reddy 1998 reddy and behera 2009a in fact the increase in well irrigation is identified as the single most important factor responsible for the collective management of tank systems in tamil nadu in recent years kajisa et al 2006 aubriot and prabhakar 2011 institutional arrangements such as dasabandam and kudimaramat in south sagar rakshya jagir in the east were in place to protect these systems from decay under dasabandam or jagir tank lands were created and given to a person in the village poligars for the purpose of maintaining the tank under kudimaramat 7 7 though kudimaramat is argued to be the creation of british rulers in order to shift the burden of tank management to local communities it was observed that community management of tanks was mostly governed by the village power structure mosse 1999 community voluntarily participates in maintaining the tank it was observed that the government of madhya pradesh was managing the tanks better even during 1950s with institutional arrangements like payment parch pani system shah 2003 distributional equity was maintained as the tail enders get the water first under this system which was imposed by the government chowkidar it is observed that the changing socio economic and policy context is not conducive for collective or community management of tank systems if the community based tank management systems were controlled by the village power structures mosse 1999 then these power structures no longer exist nor wield any power to manage the systems even the community based institutions like kudimaramat are no longer attractive due to the availability of non farm employment increased employment opportunities within the village such as watershed development wsd employment guarantee programmes etc koichi 2011 therefore the present policy orientation of focused on participatory development may not be appropriate these approaches need to orient themselves with the changing socio economic and market contexts and consequent dependence of the local communities and their conflicting interests pertaining to the tank systems evolution of efficient institutions is often linked to the local community s perceptions and dependence on the resource that is being addressed unless the needs and linkages of local communities with tank systems are understood in a broader context the tank restoration programmes may not achieve the objectives it was observed that tanks in rajasthan despite their degraded status still serve number of purposes of the local communities and rehabilitating them to their previous status may adversely affect the livelihoods of those who are presently benefiting from them shah and raju 2002 for instance the inundation irrigation practiced at present protects the interests of tank bed farmers as well as command area farmers renovating the tanks by desilting canal lining treatment of catchment area may go against the interest of the tank bed farmers while it benefits the command area farmers similarly fishing is increasingly becoming economically more viable in north and east india restoring such tanks to the previous state in order to protect the irrigation benefits may result in conflict of interest in the case of south indian tanks well owners have become an important stakeholder group ignoring the importance of groundwater recharge and conjunctive use in the south indian tanks may aggravate the conflicts between command area farmers and groundwater farmers 3 2 tank rehabilitation and modernisation programmes tank rehabilitation programmes were initiated during the early 1980s though bilateral agencies like european economic community eec world bank and ford foundation have supported rehabilitation programmes in states like tamil nadu ngos such as professional assistance for development action pradan and tarun bharat sangh tbs in rajasthan gram vikas in karnataka development of human action dhan foundation in tamil nadu and ap society for promotion of wastelands development spwd in different states have also initiated programmes to revive these traditional systems state governments were not only partners in the large initiatives but also initiated large tank renovation programmes on their own with the support from bilateral agencies like world bank during 2004 05 tank rehabilitation got the specific attention at the national level only after two decades of efforts in various states a pilot scheme for revival restoration and rehabilitation rrr of water bodies to augment the storage capacities and to recover or extend irrigation potential was initiated at the national level working committee of the planning commission recommended about rs 70 000 million us 2 33 33 million the pilot scheme envisaged a plan outlay of rs 3000 million us 100 million to be shared by central government and state governments in the ratio of 3 1 and covers the water bodies with an irrigation potential of 40 ha to 2000 ha initially the scheme was for a short period of two years though planned to link it with the programmes like national rural employment guarantee programme nregp and the bharat nirman tamil nadu karnataka ap maharashtra odisha and rajasthan are among the first states all undertaking rehabilitation and reforms with the help of national and international aid one of the first tank rehabilitation 8 8 rehabilitation was focused on desilting and strengthening the bunds and weirs programmes was piloted in tamil nadu with the financial support from ford foundation in 1984 eec and government of india goi have signed an agreement to rehabilitate 210 tanks while the phase i of the programme was completed in 1989 the phase ii was completed in 1996 covering about 44 000 ha of command area adb 2006 world bank had supported rehabilitation of 620 tanks under its water resources consolidation project wrcp national bank for agriculture and rural development nabard also provided support for 109 tanks in two phases altogether 11 034 tanks have been rehabilitated under different programmes in tamil nadu karnataka has its community based tank management project kcbtmp started in 2002 to rehabilitate 2000 irrigation tanks through community participation on pilot basis the government of karnataka gok constituted an autonomous body called the jala samvardhane yojana sangha jsys to oversee the entire task adb 2006 the project had three components i providing enabling environment for the sustainable decentralized tank management systems ii strengthening community based institutions to take up development and management activities and iii undertake system improvements the purpose is to rehabilitate the tanks and hand them over to the tank user associations tuas there are 57 cluster facilitation teams ngos working with the project a significant number of women and traditionally marginalized communities are involved and represented in the project thinksoft 2006 the maharashtra government has undertaken similar project called the maharashtra minor irrigation project mmip the project envisaged improvements to minor irrigation tanks weirs diversion weirs storage weirs bhandars and lift irrigation schemes with participation of farmers in management and operation the project components provided support for institutional reforms and capacity building in water resources management wrm irrigation service delivery and complementary investments in improving and modernizing physical assets pani panchayats would be established in the post implementation phase to ensure equitable water distribution among the farmers thinksoft 2006 the odisha water resources consolidation project owrcp was initiated with world bank assistance in 1996 its components included scheme completions systems improvement and farmer participation basin planning and environmental action plan water resources research and agricultural intensification institutional reorganization and strengthening resettlement and rehabilitation and development plan of the indigenous people pani panchayats were created to deal with tank level issues like water distribution conflict resolutions etc thinksoft 2006 this is part of the major water sector reforms in the state european union has provided support for rehabilitating 47 tanks in1997 with a focus on repairing distribution channels apart from some support funding from nabard adb 2006 ap is the first state to initiate irrigation sector reforms in india under these reforms all the tank systems with more than 45 ha of command area were brought under water user associations wuas which are expected to rehabilitate and manage the systems however since the reform focus was not tank rehabilitations tank wuas suffered due to limited funding available for rehabilitation reddy and reddy 2002 a new initiative named the andhra pradesh community based tank management project apcbtmp envisaged rehabilitating around 3000 tank systems with an estimated command area of about 2 50 000 ha the ultimate development objective is to improve tank system based livelihoods and strengthen community management of the selected tank systems main components of the project include i strengthening community based institutions for system improvement and management ii livelihoods support services for tank system users and iii post implementation project management this is a 5 year programme covering 3000 tanks in three phases national framework guidelines have been used to select the tanks for rehabilitation the criteria include a tanks irrigating 75 per cent of the area irrigated using at two stage selection and b incidence of poverty at the mandal level and having cropping intensity of less than state average in the case of tank cascades the entire cascade is to be taken up for rehabilitation thinksoft 2006 the newly formed telangana state has embarked on an ambitious tank rehabilitation programme viz mission kakatiya under this programme it is planning to restore 9306 tanks every year 20 of total tanks with an eventual target of restoring all 46 531 tanks in 5 years in a phased manner to bring 0 45 million ha in to command main activities include de silting repairing of sluices weirs etc strengthening of tank bunds repairing the feeder channels and re sectioning of irrigation channels rajasthan also has initiated tank rehabilitation along with its water sector reform project supported by the world bank viz water resources consolidation project wrcp another project supported by german bank for development reconstruction kfw envisaged rehabilitation and modernisation of 1198 large tanks over a period of 10 years like the ap model the irrigation reforms in rajasthan also tank user associations were organised to facilitate a improved utilisation of potential created b better operation and maintenance of the systems and c equitable reliable and efficient distribution of water etc raju and shah 2000 4 impact of tank rehabilitation none of the rehabilitation programmes across india has taken up a comprehensive rehabilitation of the systems the most comprehensive among them is the world bank supported ones where the activities included strengthening earthen bunds reconstruction of totally damaged sluices repairing surplus weirs rehabilitating supply channels and drainage channels repairing canal structures and selective lining of channels the focus of european community ec project was to rehabilitate the distribution system and transfer the management to wuas after providing adequate training on all aspects with specific emphasis on o m lining of field channels up to tertiary level and improvement of catchment drains to harvest rainwater was the focus of nabard funded projects on the contrary ngos supported mainly desilting and increasing tank capacity activities one common activity among all the programmes is to encourage beneficiary participation in fact community participation considered as the most important component that would ensure effective and sustainable impacts impact assessment of the rehabilitation programmes are also limited to specific activities there are very few research studies that have comprehensively assessed the impacts of the programme in terms of cost benefit analysis adb 2006 reddy and behera 2009b however a few studies have attempted cost benefit analysis of a limited number of tanks the focus of the impact studies has been on the improved availability water which is critical for determining the tank performance better availability of water in turn influences area under irrigation cropping pattern yield rates livestock fodder employment distribution of water etc palanisami et al 2008 the ngo experiments in tank rehabilitation have also emphasised livelihoods aspects of tank dependent communities adb 2006 some studies however have assessed the performance of tanks in general kumar et al 2011 or linked to institutional arrangements sakthivadivel et al 2004 though these studies have not assessed the impact of rehabilitation they provide insights in to the likely impact of tanks when they are fully functional asian development bank adb has compiled evidence on the impact of tank rehabilitation programmes in various states like tamil nadu pondicherry karnataka and odisha these programmes were funded by various agencies like eec world bank nabard ngos etc the main activities include repairs to main irrigation drainage channels lining of main irrigation channels restructuring of tank sluices and weir desilting of supply channels and tank beds improvement to catchment areas on farm development works land grading and shaping and construction of periphery bunds embankments these activities were carried out selectively in different regions rather than on each system the evidence overwhelmingly supports the positive impact of tank rehabilitation programmes across the states this is obvious because in most cases rehabilitation is in the form of improved storage water distribution systems etc which have helped increase in area under irrigation an additional social benefit is the equitable distribution of water viz improved availability of water to the tail end plots which are mostly owned by marginal farmers it is observed that canal lining has resulted in water savings to the tune of 21 per cent adb 2006 the favourable impacts are also due to the methodology adopted by these studies viz using the before and after situations as against using with and without situation moreover most of these studies do not address the long term sustainability of the programme when a more systematic assessment is followed the impacts are found to be moderate especially in the major initiatives like the eec programme in tamil nadu palanisami et al 2008 this study comparing 25 eec modernised tanks with 25 non eec tanks observed no significant differences in the performance water availability yield rates incomes etc between these two groups of tanks the main reason for this is the absence of fallow up maintenance activities in the programme tanks where the systems were going back to pre programme status this clearly raises the sustainability of the rehabilitation programmes in the absence of budgetary provision for fallow up maintenance this is also reflected in other studies as where a major complaint from the farmers was that in most of the rehabilitated systems rehabilitation is treated as a one time activity and after the programme is closed neither the implementing agency nor the funding agency revisits the system to provide advice and or to carry out minor modifications and repairs if any adb 2006 on the other hand some of the ngo implemented programmes are observed to have performed better in terms of impacts and sustainability when compared to control tank systems reddy and behara 2009a number of studies has reported substantial improvements in productivity crop intensity employment livestock production etc besides availability of fuel wood also increased in most of the study tanks improved groundwater recharge is another important impact of tank rehabilitation rehabilitation has benefited both drinking water and irrigation wells in the command area and beyond the augmented recharge directly benefits the land owning households and indirectly benefits the poor and landless through an increase in employment days water markets have become active and provided access to water even to the poor improved access to drinking water helps reducing the drudgery of women and children and improves quality of life at the same time extensive canal lining reduced groundwater recharge in fact use of tank storage for artificial recharge at times of scarcity using tank as percolation pond is fast catching up in karnataka where orchards and cash crops are replacing cereal crops and crop diversification is taking place under well irrigation adb 2006 the activity of lining could become a conflict of interest between well owning and command area farmers another important area of impact and conflict is the desilting of tanks which is carried out in most of the ngo programmes and not in large donor funded rehabilitation programmes apart from improving the water storage capacity of the tank application of tank silt to farm lands contributes to the land productivity in a study of tank rehabilitation in ap it was observed that yield increases range between 20 and 40 per cent due to silt application davuluri nd it also reduced the use of chemical fertilizers by about 50 60 per cent compared to earlier years desilting of tank and application of tank silt to farm lands on a regular basis is a traditional practice from the economic point of view it was estimated in the case of karnataka desilting is viable if there is market for silt gireesh et al 1997 of late carrying out desilting activities is becoming difficult not due to economic reasons but due to shortage or lack of willingness on the part of labour to engage in such hard work and there are not many takers for silt due to transportation costs in the absence of demand for silt it is often dumped outside the tank which gets in to tank with the first rains given the high costs coupled with the problems of disposal partial desiltation is recommended in the case of tamil nadu palanisami et al 2010 it is also proposed that desilting can be combined with social forestry which is practiced on tank beds in tamil nadu in order to get twin benefits the rate of return is estimated at 8 per cent from this combined activity this would ensure benefits from enhanced storage capacity of the tank as well as the benefits of social forestry on the tank beds palanisami et al 2010 low sustainability of tank rehabilitation in most regions is giving rise to the demand for pts especially in the regions with high well density in the command area pts apart from recharging groundwater improves availability of water for human and livestock for longer periods and also facilitates fishing activities though not many tanks are designed for percolation most of the tanks that are in disrepair function like pts in a study of tamil nadu it was observed that half of the defunct tanks function as pts by default palanisami and meinzen dick 2001 from economic angle also the conversion to pts is more beneficial net returns per hectare when tanks used purely for irrigation purely for percolation and mixed ones are compared palanisami and amarasinghe 2008 and such conversions are more conducive for small tanks under panchayat raj institutions pris however pts may adversely impact the distributional equity as some of the farmers depending on low cost flow irrigation may be deprived if they do not have capacity to invest in borewells reddy and behara 2009a it was observed in a study of tamil nadu that only 15 per cent of the farmers have wells and there is potential to increase the numbers by 25 per cent palanisami and amarasinghe 2008 this in turn may lead to conflict of interest between well owners and non well owners in one such situation where farmers in the command area who do not own wells raised objections for conversion of tanks the problem was amicably resolved with an arrangement for assured water sharing between farmers with wells and those without wells that is farmers without wells pay one third of their harvest to the farmers with wells for supplying water for their fields davuluri nd however the situation is fast changing as more and more farmers including small and marginal are investing in borewells with the declining cost of well irrigation reddy 2005 besides the improved employment avenues at the village and the surrounding areas has helped checking migration to a large extent adb 2006 palanisami et al 2008 reddy and behara 2009a at the same time these opportunities are also proving detrimental in terms of peoples participation in the tank rehabilitation activities in fact even agricultural operations are getting effected especially after the advent of nregp that assures employment for 100 days in a year which is preferred by the communities for nregp is treated as welfare programme rather than an employment programme i e good wages with less effort reddy 2011 the participatory approach adopted in the rehabilitation programmes has some social impacts as well these include equal participation of socially disadvantaged sections like scheduled castes scs as members in the executive committees this is mainly due to the representative and democratic approach of electing member to committees adb 2006 this has given the much needed voice to these communities another social impact pertains to the reduced gender differences in wage rates due to the implementation of equal wage rule in most programmes including wsd besides women participation and membership has been made mandatory in some of the recent reforms like wuas participatory institutions have become mandatory for any rehabilitation programme as the initial assessments of the rehabilitation programmes have identified the absence of peoples participation as the reason for poor impacts adb 2006 in a study of 41 tanks spread over 22 districts in 8 states observed that techno institutional mechanisms are central to most of the best performing tanks across the country sakthivadivel et al 2004 participation is not only in terms of mandatory labour for cleaning up the feeder channels and distributaries and user contribution but also for negotiating with the neighbouring and village communities these negotiations help in evicting the encroachment of tank bed and feeder channels in one of the eec projects in tamil nadu the farmers of the down stream tank negotiated with the up stream farmers to do repairs and improvement works for their feeder channel so that downstream tank can get more water the agreement was that downstream tank community allocate funds for upstream farmers in one of the tanks in odisha new channels to harvest more rainwater from the watershed were created by the community through voluntary labour it may be noted that most of the impact assessment studies are partial in their assessments as they have neither included all the tank uses and benefits in their analysis nor taken the environmental and social impacts in to account even when multiple uses like irrigation drinking water livestock fishing etc are considered studies have limited their analysis to economic values as measuring the social impacts are difficult though environmental impacts can be assessed the estimation procedures are cumbersome despite the partial assessment benefits from tank rehabilitation outweigh the costs in most cases these benefits could be enhanced further through reallocation of available water between crops seasons and activities kumar et al 2011 however how long these benefits sustain in the absence of post implementation financial and institutional support is a moot point it was observed even in the ngo implemented rehabilitation programmes over time peoples participation was limited to monetary contribution forcing the management committee mc to contract out the works davuluri nd as a result there were allegations of misappropriation of funds by the mc and the committee became defunct soon after the implementation and no efforts were made to revive the old committee or elect a new one leaving tank without any formal body to look after the regular maintenance 5 climate change and tank rehabilitation the major impacts of climate change are likely to occur through water climate change predictions of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc for south asia indian region indicated 0 5o c 1 2o c increase in temperature by 2020 ipcc 2007 rainfall pattern is also likely to change in terms of distribution and intensity while agriculture as a whole is expected to be mostly negatively affected rain fed agriculture where tank irrigation is concentrated in particular is expected to be impacted differently under the climate change ipcc 2007 rain fed agriculture may have unexpected changes in its crop compositions and crop calendar as the pattern and structure of climatic variables may change these unexpected changes could sometimes be beneficial when they are internalised but mostly these impacts become cascading due to the various socio economic changes taking place in these regions increasing commercialization changes in gender and age composition of working farmers and lack of educated farmers in agriculture increasing labour costs and declining labour productivity are some of the changes that complicate the situation on the ground the cascading impact of all these changes accentuated by the climate variability seems to be driving the fortunes of the rain fed farmers more importantly the farming communities and institutions are unable to foresee these impacts and adequately prepare themselves to face the challenges on the other hand some of the states in the indo gangetic plains such as uttar pradesh and bihar may experience floods due to ice melt different regions may experience different kinds of water stress overall the demand for water is likely to increase especially during rabi november february season incidence of prolonged droughts and frequent floods may increase in the coming years conservation of moisture and water storage becomes critical for adapting to such climate changes tank systems should be designed in such a way that they can with stand and help mitigate the extreme situations this calls for a systematic and comprehensive approach tank systems should be made part of the overall water policy as observed in most of the states canal irrigation tank irrigation and well irrigation are considered and treated as separate entities though some states like ap brought tank systems under wuas their approach to rehabilitating and managing these systems falls short of requirements reddy and reddy 2002 in the context of increased temperatures storage of water in sub surface aquifers assumes importance to reduce evaporation rates and tanks need to be connected to canal systems wherever possible in order to face water shortages and severe droughts on the other hand interlinking of tanks cascading becomes critical in the event of excess precipitation and floods this is possible only with a comprehensive approach of integrating the three sources of irrigation in a river basin or watershed context rainfall forecasts should be effectively used to predict likely nature of tank filling non systems tanks should be converted into system tanks by linking the canal river systems wherever possible so that surplus water during heavy rains can be diverted to the tanks easily the tank chain should be restored to facilitate for the diversion of water from upstream us tanks to downstream tanks ds in all the future government spending programs on tanks this should be made compulsory while an integrated approach is necessary across the country the requirements of the systems could differ from region to region depending on the changes or expected changes in climatic conditions for instance the need and extent of desilting and the need for conversion of irrigation tanks in to pts may vary from region to region palanisami et al 2010 regular monitoring of climate as well as hydrological data at appropriate scale is a prerequisite for sustainable resource management srm at present climate as well as hydrology variables are measured at the block or sub district level this scale of observation does not reflect the village level reality making the information totally irrelevant to the farmer establishment of rain gauge and hydrological monitoring stations need to be at the village level and surface hydrology monitoring should be carried out for each tank system in a river basin these systems are neither costly nor difficult to handle by the communities reddy 2012 such information would help in identifying appropriate activities and investments in the context of climate change for instance partial desilting and increase in well density are observed to be more appropriate in the context of tamil nadu tank systems in order to cope with the impact of climate change in the future palanisami et al 2010 similarly tanks connected to canals system tanks are expected to provide more opportunities for improvement compared to non system tanks palanisami and rosegrant 1995 as quoted in palanisami et al 2010 generation of technical information at appropriate scale is a prerequisite for policy planning in the context of climate change 6 conclusions and strategies for policy traditional water harvesting systems like tanks are integral to agricultural development livelihoods of rural communities though the importance of these systems varies across regions and states of india they serve number of critical and strident purposes like provision of drinking water protective irrigation etc the evidence from number of research studies across the regions is unequivocal in saying that the benefits from tank rehabilitation outweigh the costs therefore the policy initiatives to restore irrigation tanks are rational as far as achieving the objective of improving rural livelihoods and alleviating poverty in drought prone regions is concerned scaling up of tank rehabilitation at the national and state level is critical for substantial benefits to the local communities despite two decades of efforts in various states the proportion of tanks rehabilitated is less than ten per cent of the defunct tanks perhaps same number if not more of tanks may be falling in to disrepair every year therefore the efforts and allocations towards tank rehabilitation needs to be increased many fold though the review clearly shows that number of activities go in to tank rehabilitation all the activities in a comprehensive manner are taken up only in a few cases each programme funder has its priority of interventions moreover the priorities may not be same in all the regions nor they suit the local conditions for tank uses benefits users or stakeholders differ from region to region hence tank rehabilitation strategies ought to be specific to the regional requirements in what follows we present some general strategies common to all the regions although the immediate benefits of tank restoration are conspicuous sustaining these benefits in the long run is the crux of the problem this aspect needs to be given due importance while scaling up the programme especially by government agencies this calls for major policy initiatives at the national as well as state level these include 1 there is need for a comprehensive approach to water resources planning integrating canals tanks and groundwater policy should treat the three sources of irrigation as complementary to each rather than considering them as substitutes that is all the three sources of irrigation need to be brought under a management regime at watershed or river basin scale 2 technical aspects like geo hydrology soils land use etc need to be made part of planning while designing tank rehabilitation 3 generation of climate and hydrological information at an appropriate scale should be given high priority at the national level some states are already planning to establish low cost rain gauge stations at the village level 4 allocations towards tank rehabilitation need to be enhanced in order to fasten the pace of rehabilitation financing of tank rehabilitation needs to be changed to asset based planning instead of the one time programme based approach in order to ensure sustainability of the tank systems in the long run this could be done following a life cycle cost approach lca where capital asset management is part of project costing this would help in enhancing the benefits from the livelihood and income support policies such as fishery dairy and other allied activities 5 this calls for permanent institutional arrangements that have constitutional validity as well as linkages and manage the tanks on a continuous basis this would have double impact of managing the structures in a more systematic manner and using the fund flows efficiently 6 the present participatory approach seems to over emphasise the voluntary participation this may no longer be feasible in the changing socio economic and policy context constitutionally recognised institutional arrangements with incentive and disincentives mechanisms in place could be the way forward 7 addressing the equity concerns especially relating to groundwater in the context of pts is one of the important concerns number of experiments like andhra pradesh farmers managed groundwater systems apfmags well sharing and social regulation is going on in various states reddy et al 2014 lessons drawn from such experiments could help scaling up of equitable and sustainable groundwater management and 8 though multiple uses of tank systems are not new the economics of various activities like fishing are changing these changing or new demands of the community

11338,knowledge of rooting systems and soil water status across rooting zones is important for stabilizing agricultural productivity in the semi arid regions of china in the present study a mobile rainproof shelter trial was performed to find out the effects of cultivation mode on the temporal and spatial root growth distribution soil water content root respiration rate and grain yield during 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 growing seasons the two cultivation modes were 1 the ridge furrow rf rainfall harvesting technique and 2 traditional flat planting tf in addition three simulated rainfall 1 275 2 200 3 125 mm and two deficit irrigation 150 75 mm levels were used our results showed that different cultivation modes with simulated precipitation levels significantly improved moisture content for wheat growth improved root growth and provided favourable conditions for higher wheat production the rf150 treatment with 200 mm rainfall significantly increased morphology of the wheat rooting system especially in the top 40 cm soil layer compared with tf cultivation the rf150 treatment significantly increased root dry weight 47 root tissue density 6 7 root fineness 4 8 root length ratio 20 3 root mass ratio 27 3 and grain yield 18 9 of wheat at 200 mm rainfall than that of tf2150 treatment root weight density root length density root surface area density and root diameter were significantly higher under rf150 treatment with 200 mm and 275 mm precipitation in the 40 cm soil layer and reached maximum values at the flowering stage the root dry weight root respiration rate and grain yield were significantly improved under rf2150 treatment but there were no significant differences when the rainwater increased from 200 to 275 mm under both cultivation modes therefore we suggested that the rf2150 treatment is a suitable water saving strategy to improve temporal and spatial root growth distribution resulting in higher grain yield in a dry land farming system keywords cultivation modes rainfall simulator grain yield root morphology root respiration rate soil water content 1 introduction water availability is the most essential limiting factor for wheat crop production in rain fed areas of china gan et al 2008 in these regions precipitation is the most important water source for agricultural development and production du et al 2015 and inadequate or unpredictable rainfall often results in low crop productivity and sometimes total crop failure wang et al 2011a the seasonal evapotranspiration et rate in these regions ranges from 750 to 1000 mm which is considerably higher than the annual precipitation rate 250 550 mm ren et al 2010 however 70 of groundwater resources in these areas are used for agricultural production zhao et al 2013 the water table has been affected by deep irrigation and misuse of groundwater resources currell et al 2012 and has decreased by 0 5 3 m year in the northwest part of china over the last 20 years du et al 2015 thus it is essential to apply efficient water saving agriculture strategies to not only efficiently store soil water from small precipitation events but also efficiently store rainfall water in root zones of crop for use during drought phases to attain higher crop productivity shao et al 2011 precipitation harvesting techniques with plastic film mulching have been implemented in rain fed regions of china to store rainfall for later crop use wang et al 2009 several practices have been used to trap rainfall water wang et al 2011b of these practices the ridge furrow rf precipitation harvesting method with plastic film has been recommended as one of the most efficient to optimize crop productivity chakraborty et al 2008 the ridge covered with plastic film mulch can conserve more rainwater extend the period of water accessibility and improve crop productivity by saving rainwater from light precipitation and by retaining surface runoff from heavy precipitation as compared with traditional flat planting wang et al 2009 the rf system with ridge covered with plastic film significantly increased water content crop productivity and wue in semi arid zones xiao et al 2007 but very limited research has been conducted on root growth and its association with soil moisture availability in winter wheat under the rf system with plastic film to attain higher crop productivity in semi arid regions knowledge of root morphology is essential liu et al 2011 roots of the winter wheat crop have a significant role in sensing ecological modifications and conveying that information to the aboveground parts of the plant to provoke suitable adaptive responses such as changes in root morphology and metabolic activity to optimize the consumption of limited water resources chaves et al 2003 the roots of the winter wheat crop are the most significant organ for nutrient and rainwater uptake and have a vital role in the plant and soil ecosystem spedding et al 2004 zhang et al 2014 thus the relationships of soil water and crop rooting systems have been studied more intensely in recent years soil water has been found to enhance the accessibility of nutrients and nutrients enhance root growth and crop productivity besharat et al 2010 root growth and distribution heavily influence water and nutrient uptake in winter wheat crops li et al 2010 the main root morphological features of winter wheat are root weight density root length density root surface area density root diameter and root respiration rate all of which directly affect the function of the whole root system and indirectly affect aboveground biomass accumulation xia et al 2005 fageria 2004 water scarcity decreases uptake of nutrients and limits root growth and distribution araki et al 2012 corn grown under the rf system with deficit irrigation conditions produced higher root length root diameter and root weight density which improved nutrient and water uptake capacity and thus decreased water deficit stress and improve corn yields shen et al 2013 the rf system with simulated precipitation conditions significantly affected soil water storage in corn significantly increased root penetration and thus produced higher root length density and increased soil and root respiration rates which finally improved characteristics of spike and maize production gan et al 2013 root length is an important aspect for assessing the rf cultivation mode under deficit irrigation li et al 2001 mosaddeghi et al 2009 however there have been limited studies on the mechanisms to improve wheat productivity through modify root growth and root respiration rate under the rf mode with simulated rainfall and deficit irrigation conditions thus the objectives of this field based trial were to i determine temporal and spatial root morphological growth of winter wheat under different cultivation modes with deficit irrigation ii estimate soil water contents at different depths root and soil respiration rates under simulated rainfall conditions and iii study the interactive effect of cultivation modes with deficit irrigation on root growth root respiration rate moisture content and production of wheat under simulated rainfall conditions and to reduce drought in a rain fed regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the field study was performed during 2015 2017 at the northwest a f university shaanxi province china 34 20 n 108 24 e the experimental site was 466 7 m above sea level the trial site is located in a warm temperate semi arid region with an annual mean temperature of 12 9 c and annual low and high temperatures of 17 4 c and 42 c respectively the annual evaporation rate was 1753 mm the total duration of daylight was 2196 h per year with a frost free period of 220 days per year annual average rainfall of 380 mm per year occurred between july and september selected soil physico chemical properties of the experimental site for the soil layers in the 0 60 cm depth are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and treatments the field study was performed under waterproof sheds the size inside the shed was 3 m height 15 m width 32 m length the mobile waterproof sheds were used to manage natural rainfall the precipitation level partitioning was derived from the spatial and temporal characteristics of the precipitation distribution in the semi arid areas of northern china over the past 48 years period 1966 2014 in the precipitation simulation three seasonal rainfalls 275 200 and 125 mm corresponded to heavy moderate and light simulated rain levels in this study simulated rainfall levels were applied as described in a previous study ali et al 2017 and no natural precipitation was allowed during the wheat growing season complete detail of the precipitation events can be seen in table 2 the amount of rainwater used in this study was reasonably similar to natural rainfall amounts the research trial consisted of two planting patterns rf ridge furrow rainfall collection and tf traditional flat planting with three precipitation levels 1 275 mm 2 200 mm and 3 125 mm and two deficit irrigation 150 mm and 75 mm levels in a randomized complete block design rcbd with four replicates using a precise water meter half of the deficit irrigation was supplied on december 12 2015 and december 15 2016 before the re wintering stage and the other half was supplied on march 28 2016 and march 25 2017 at the jointing stage during two growing season o f winter wheat the deficit irrigation volumes for 150 and 75 mm were measured according to the irrigation area the irrigation area for the tf cultivation treatment was 6 3 m2 2 0 m 3 15 m and the irrigation volume was 0 95 and 0 47 m3 under 150 and 75 mm respectively the irrigation area under the rf technique of the two furrows was 3 78 m2 1 2 m 3 15 m and the irrigation volumes of the two furrows were 0 57 and 0 28 m3 the rf technique used a ridge height of 15 cm with a ratio of furrow to ridge widths of 60 40 cm a plastic film was used to cover all ridges with hidden edges 4 5 cm deep in the soil four rows of wheat were sown in furrows the length and width of each cemented pond plot was 3 15 m 2 0 m with and 3 m in depth and plots were split divided by 17 cm thick concrete walls to avoid the exchange of soil water contents between plots weeds were controlled manually during each growing season of the winter wheat crop wheat cultivar xinong 979 was sown at the rate of 2 25 106 seeds ha 1 the seeds were planted with an inter row space of 20 cm on october 15 2015 and on october 10 2016 wheat was hand harvested on june 2 2016 and on may 27 2017 nitrogen urea diammonium phosphate at 225 kg ha 1 and phosphorus diammonium phosphate at 75 kg ha 1 were applied at the time of planting 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 root length weight surface area and diameter root samples were collected from each treatment at flowering and harvesting stages during the 2016 and 2017 study years at each sampling time soil root columns were taken using a soil auger with an 8 cm internal diameter at three different positions including planting spots intra plant spots within rows and intra row spots each core was taken at 10 cm increments down to 90 cm soil depth the soil sample was poured into a 0 25 mm2 mesh sieve and roots were gently washed with tap water until they were free of soil the live roots white colour and dead roots dark colour on the sieve were carefully separated according to gregory 1994 root images from each soil core section were obtained using a scanner epson v700 indonesia to determine root length root surface area and root diameter root images were analysed using winrhizo software version 5 0 canada according to li et al 2010 the root dry weight density rwd mg cm 3 root length density rld cm cm 3 and root surface area density rsd cm2 cm 3 were calculated based on the above measurements root length ratio root length whole plant dry weight cm g 1 root mass ratio root dry weight whole plant dry weight g g 1 root fineness root length root volume cm cm 3 and root tissue density root dry weight root volume g cm 3 were calculated 2 3 2 soil water content the soil water content swc was measured at the flowering stage seed filling stage and maturity stage in both study years an access tube made of seamless aluminum alloy 50 mm internal diameter was fixed in the middle of each furrow for soil water content swc measurements moisture content of the 0 2 m soil profile at 20 cm intervals were recorded using a tdr meter time domain reflectometry germany 2 3 3 soil and root respiration rate soil and root respiration chambers were separately installed in the soil 24 h before the experiment the green plants were cut off and the soil was disturbed as little as possible to minimize the influence of soil disturbance and root damage measurements of soil and root respiration were taken using an li 8100 automated soil co2 flux system connected with temperature and moisture sensors measurements were taken at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages of the winter wheat crop 2 3 4 winter wheat production four central rows of winter wheat were hand harvested from each plot to measure grain yield the grain yield was calculated including the combined area of the ridges and furrows 2 3 5 statistical analysis data from each sampling event were analysed individually with anova in spss version 18 0 means were tested with a least significant difference test lsd at p 0 05 the variations in rwd rld rsd root diameter soil and root respiration rate between the two study years were not significant therefore only data from the 2016 17 study years were used 3 results 3 1 root weight density rwd the root weight densities rwd for all soil layer depths were determined in the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 study years fig 1 values for the 2015 2016 study year are not presented because they were not significantly different from those obtained for the 2016 2017 study year rwd is one of the key parameters used to evaluate the winter wheat rooting system cultivation modes with simulated rainfall conditions and deficit irrigation significantly affected rwd across 0 90 cm layer of soil at flowering and harvesting growth stages fig 1 rwd under the rf150 treatment with 200 mm and 275 mm precipitation was significantly higher than in the tf150 treatment with 125 mm simulated rainfall at the depth of 0 40 cm at the flowering stage there was no significant variation in rwd over the 50 90 cm soil layers among all treatments at the flowering stage at the harvesting stage under the rf150 treatment with 200 mm precipitation the rwd was significantly greater than the tf150 treatment with 125 mm simulated rainfall over the 0 30 cm soil profile in contrast rwd decreased more in the tf150 treatment compared to the tf75 treatment at 125 mm simulated rainfall in all soil profiles during flowering and harvesting stages at the maturity stage rwd was reduced under all treatments and in all soil layers compared to the flowering stage but the decrease was smaller in the rf150 treatment at 200 mm and 275 mm simulated rainfall conditions compared to the tf150 and tf75 treatments respectively the rwd of winter wheat at the depths of 0 90 cm increased and reached a maximum at the flowering stage followed by a slow decline starting at the maturity stage 3 2 root length density rld and root surface area density rsd the rld is a fundamental determinant of soil nutrient acquisition and water uptake in winter wheat in the current study winter wheat rld slowly decreased from flowering to maturity stage across the 0 90 cm soil layer depths the majority of winter wheat roots were concentrated in the uppermost soil profile 0 50 cm where water was adequate under the rf cultivation mode than that of tf cultivation the rld was significantly higher under the rf cultivation mode than that of tf cultivation mode for most soil layer depths at the flowering and maturity stages fig 2 the rf150 treatment with 200 mm and 275 mm precipitation concentrations had significantly higher rld than that of tf cultivation mode at the flowering and maturity stages at the flowering and maturity stages of winter wheat rld in the uppermost soil layer 10 30 cm showed obvious variations under both cultivation modes with different deficit irrigation and rainfall levels the maximum rld was calculated under rf1150 treatments followed by rf2150 treatments across the root zone soil layer 0 40 cm at the flowering stage among all the treatments there were no significant differences in rld at the depths of 50 90 cm at the flowering stage and maturity stage under different cultivation modes with deficit irrigation and simulated precipitation conditions rsd had a similar trend to rld at the depths of 0 90 cm fig 3 rsd under the rf system was significantly higher compared to the tf cultivation mode at the depths of 0 90 cm the rf150 treatment with 200 mm and 275 mm precipitation levels produced significantly higher rsd across 0 60 cm soil profile depths compared to tf cultivation at the flowering stage among all treatments no significant differences in rsd were recorded across 60 90 cm soil depths at the flowering stage while at the maturity stage there were no significant differences in rsd were recorded across 30 90 cm soil depth at the maturity stage the rsd was significantly higher under the rf1150 treatment followed by the rf2150 treatment compared to the tf cultivation mode in the 10 20 cm soil layer 3 3 root diameter cm and root dry weight g per plant roots of the winter wheat crop under the rf cultivation mode with different precipitation conditions had a thicker diameter than in the tf cultivation mode fig 4 a thicker root diameter was recorded under the rf150 treatment with 275 mm simulated rainfall compared to tf cultivation at the depths of 0 90 cm at the flowering stage while at harvesting stage the root diameter gradually reduced among all the treatments except rf1150 treatment the rf150 treatment with 200 mm and 275 mm precipitation produced a significantly thicker root diameter across the 10 20 cm soil depths compared to the tf cultivation mode at the flowering and harvesting stages at the 200 mm and 275 mm rainfall levels under both cultivation modes the root diameter was not significantly different across 60 90 cm soil depths at the flowering and maturity stages while at the 125 mm rainfall level the root diameter was not significantly different across 20 90 cm soil depths the root dry weight g per plant was significantly improved in rf1150 tf1150 and rf175 treatments by 94 52 and 40 respectively compared to the tf175 treatment table 4 the root dry weight g per plant for rf2150 tf2150 and rf275 were significantly improved by 72 17 and 14 respectively compared to tf275 treatment compared with tf375 root dry matter g per plant for rf3150 tf3150 and rf375 treatments were significantly increased by 83 33 and 31 respectively there was no significant variation in root dry weight g per plant under 150 mm irrigation when increasing the rainfall from 200 mm to 275 mm under both cultivation modes 3 4 morphology of winter wheat rooting system the root morphology parameters root tissue density root fineness root length ratio and root mass ratio

root mass ratio were not significantly different between rf1150 and rf2150 treatments 3 5 soil water content and root respiration rate μmol m 2 s 1 the rf system retained significantly higher soil water content swc at critical growth stages of the winter wheat crop at soil depths of 0 200 cm compared to tf cultivation fig 5 the differences between the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were not significant at a depth of 0 200 cm during the flowering filling and harvesting stages the swc significantly increased at the 0 60 cm soil depth during the flowering and grain filling stages but swc significantly decreased at soil depths of 60 200 cm under both cultivation modes in addition under both cultivation modes the moisture content increased as the precipitation and deficit irrigation amounts increased the moisture content under the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were considerably maximum than the rest of the treatments at the flowering filling and harvesting stages under the rf system the moisture content significantly increased compared to tf cultivation at depths of 0 80 cm during the maturity stage this indicated that the winter wheat crop under the rf system took up less water from deeper soil compared to tf cultivation the soil and root respiration rates at critical growth stages of the wheat crop were considerably improved under the rf method compared to the tf cultivation mode with different precipitation and irrigation conditions table 3 under the rf150 treatment the soil and root respiration rates were not significantly different at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages with 200 mm and 275 mm rainfall levels at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages the soil respiration rates under the rf1150 treatment were greater by 10 6 40 1 and 34 9 respectively and the root respiration rates were greater by 28 1 26 8 and 48 6 respectively compared to the tf1150 treatment under the rf2150 treatment the soil respiration rates at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages were greater by 7 5 23 0 and 34 3 respectively and the root respiration rates were greater by 31 2 35 3 and 23 3 respectively compared to the tf2150 treatment 3 6 winter wheat production the rf cultivation mode with different irrigation and rainfall conditions significantly p 0 05 affected yield production of wheat compared to tf cultivation fig 6 the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments had significantly higher grain yield compared to tf1150 and tf2150 treatments but the grain yield between rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were not significantly the average of two years data explained that the rf cultivation mode improved moisture content soil and root respiration rates and decreased et the grain yield was 15 greater than under the tf cultivation mode the mean grain yield of two years were significantly increased by 10 6 in rf1150 and 12 6 in rf175 compared to tf1150 and tf175 treatments respectively compared with tf2150 and tf275 treatments grain yield of rf2150 and rf275 treatments were significantly increased by 18 9 and 22 5 respectively average grain yield was significantly increased by 14 3 in rf3150 and 8 9 in rf375 treatments than that of tf3150 and tf375 treatments table 4 4 discussion 4 1 effect of cultivation modes with simulated precipitation and deficit irrigation on root growth and distribution wheat roots are the main organ taking up rainwater and nutrients and thus its size and distribution in soil are closely related to its water and nutrient uptake capacity forde and lorenzo 2001 some previous studies have shown that excess or deficit water conditions can change the size and distribution of corn root zones thereby inhibiting root growth liu et al 2009 in winter wheat ridges covered with plastic mulch allow for efficient use of light rainfall by enhancing water accessibility compared to conventional flat planting without mulching as a result enhancing root growth and distributions han et al 2015 in the rf system rainwater penetrated deeper resulting in less evaporation and leading to improved water accessibility for the maize crop over the long term liu et al 2009 the rf system increases moisture content at the depths of 0 60 cm enhancing maize root growth development and distributions jia et al 2018 rld and rsd are key parameters for characterizing winter wheat root systems mosaddeghi et al 2009 vertical root growth has a large effect on water and nutrient uptake capabilities of wheat doussan et al 2006 the rf cultivation mode can affect water accessibility to crops mostly through deeper rainwater infiltration in the furrow zone which improved rld and rsd mu noz romero et al 2010 rld and rsd are significantly greater under the rf cultivation mode than that of tf cultivation mode at depths of 10 50 cm furthermore there is no significant variation in rld and rsd under both cultivation modes below 50 cm qin et al 2006 in the current study we found that the rld and rsd slowly decreased from flowering to maturity stage at the depths of 0 90 cm the rld and rsd were considerably greater under the rf system compared to tf cultivation for most of the soil layer depths at the flowering and maturity stages figs 2 3 the maximum rld and rsd occurred under rf1150 followed by rf2150 treatments at soil depths of 0 40 cm at the flowering stage there were no significant differences in rld and rsd at 50 90 cm soil depths at the flowering stage while at the maturity stage there were no significant differences in rld and rsd of 30 90 cm soil depths our results agree with fang et al 2011 under the rf system moisture content was significantly improved in the uppermost soil layer which markedly influenced the root growth and its distribution and as a result improved rld and rsd compared to tf planting fageria 2004 yuhong et al 2014 reported that about 80 of the total rld and rsd are accumulated in the 40 cm top soil depth under high moisture conditions root diameter and length are important morphological root parameters that affect uptake of water and nutrients ren et al 2008 root diameter had a significant influence on deeper root penetration in soil li et al 2010 allowing higher uptake if water from deeper in the soil profile in the rain fed regions of australia li et al 2001 confirmed that root diameter and length of wheat highly depended on water availability in our study we found that a thicker root diameter of wheat crop was recorded under the rf150 treatment compared to tf cultivation with 275 mm simulated rainfall at depths of 0 90 cm at the flowering stage while at the harvesting stage the root diameter slowly reduced among all the treatments except rf1150 treatment fig 4 the rf150 treatment with 200 mm and 275 mm precipitation conditions produced considerably thicker root diameter across the 10 20 cm soil layer at the flowering and harvesting stage at the 125 mm rainfall level under both cultivation modes the root diameter was not significantly different across the 20 90 cm soil layer depth at the flowering and maturity stages a wide root system supports the crops by reducing drought stress chenyang et al 2014 guo et al 2001 also confirmed that drought stress could prevent root growth and plays a significant role in root morphology of wheat crop the root morphological parameters were significantly p 0 05 different in the rf cultivation mode with different rainfall and deficit irrigation conditions compared to the tf cultivation mode at the harvesting stage table 3 the root tissue density root fineness root length ratio and root mass ratio for the rf2150 treatment were significantly increased by 6 7 4 8 20 3 and 27 3 respectively compared to the tf2150 treatment but the root tissue density root length ratio and root mass ratio were not significantly different between the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments 4 2 effect of cultivation mode on root weight density the response of the wheat rooting system to cultivation modes and variable soil factors can be complex chenyang et al 2014 in a previous study plastic mulching improved soil structure soil temperatures moisture content and nutrients fang et al 2011 this leads to an improvement in lateral root growth and in water and nutrient uptake increasing rwd and root dry matter per plant xue et al 2003 sharratt and gesch 2004 more frequently irrigated wheat has higher rwd than wheat in non irrigated treatments xue et al 2003 our results illustrated that rf150 with 200 mm and 275 mm precipitation increased rwd compared to tf150 treatment with 200 mm and 275 mm at a depth of 0 40 cm at the flowering stage there was no significant variation in rwd at a depth of 50 90 cm at the flowering stage in contrast rwd decreased more under the tf150 treatment compared to the tf75 treatment at 125 mm rainfall in all soil profiles during the flowering and harvesting stage the rwd of wheat at a depth of 0 90 cm increased faster and reached a maximum at the flowering stage followed by a slow decrease at the maturity stage zhang et al 2009 determined that maximum shoot dry matter is significantly related to maximum root dry matter which contributes to maximum crop production our study also showed that root dry matter g per plant for rf2150 tf2150 and rf275 were significantly increased by 72 17 and 14 respectively compared to tf275 treatment there was no significant variation in root dry matter g per plant under 150 mm irrigation when increasing the rainfall from 200 mm to 275 mm under both cultivation modes as reported by sheng et al 2012 root and total biomass plant 1 were significantly higher under the rf cultivation mode compared to tf planting 4 3 effect of cultivation mode on soil water content respiration rate and grain yield wang et al 2012 reported that ridges covered with plastic mulch decreased precipitation water losses and evaporation and increased water content ridges covered with plastic mulch significantly raised moisture content due to increased rainfall harvesting productivities compared to the ridge furrow cultivation mode ren et al 2016 we also found that under the rf method retained higher soil water content at critical growth stages of wheat crop at soil depths of 0 200 cm compared to tf cultivation fig 5 the swc significantly increased at 0 60 cm soil depth during flowering and grain filling stages while in the 60 200 cm soil depths the swc decreased under both cultivation modes in addition under both cultivation modes the moisture content increased as the precipitation and deficit irrigation amounts increased under the rf system winter wheat crop took up less water from the deeper soil profile compared to tf cultivation the rf method with 440 340 and 230 mm precipitation increased maize grain yields by 80 44 and 12 ramakrishna et al 2006 the rf cultivation mode enhanced moisture content at critical growth stages of wheat which enhanced wheat productivity wang et al 2011b in the present study under the rf cultivation mode with different rainfall and irrigation levels significantly affected the grain yield of wheat fig 6 the rf method enhanced soil water content soil and root respiration rates and reduced et therefore the grain yield was 15 higher than that of tf cultivation mode our results are consistent with ren et al 2016 fang et al 2011 also confirmed that plastic film mulching with 340 mm simulated rainfall conditions improved moisture content decreased soil evaporation and increased crop transpiration and grain yield soil respiration is mostly produced by microbial oxidation of organic matter and root respiration and is an important sign of soil quality moisture content and root morphological characteristics pan et al 2003 our study also showed that the soil and root respiration rates were significantly higher under the rf cultivation mode than that of tf cultivation table 2 under the rf150 treatment the soil and root respiration rates were not significantly different at jointing flowering and grain filling stages with 200 mm and 275 mm rainfall levels under the rf2150 treatment the soil and root respiration rates at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages were greater than that of tf2150 treatment wang et al 2011a also found that the soil and root respiration rates significantly improved with increasing irrigation under the rf system but over irrigation reduced soil and root respiration rate zhang et al 2014 also confirmed that under heavy rainfall soil and root respiration was inhibited while the wet growing season chen et al 2013 suppressed the soil respiration rate by 33 therefore we recommend that the rf2150 treatment could be a suitable water saving strategy to enhance root growth root spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of spike and produce maximum grain yield 5 conclusions based on the results of the current study we conclude that rf cultivation mode with simulated rainfall concentrations and deficit irrigations significantly improved soil water content for wheat growth promoted root growth and thus provided favourable conditions for wheat high yield the rf150 treatment with 200 mm rainfall significantly enhanced morphology of the winter wheat rooting system especially at the 40 cm top soil layer compared to tf planting the rf150 treatment significantly improved root dry matter root tissue density root fineness root length ratio and root mass ratio of winter wheat at 200 mm and 275 mm rainfall levels rwd rld and rsd were significantly greater under the rf150 with 200 mm and 275 mm at the 40 cm top soil layer and reached a maximum value at the flowering stage compared with flat cultivation the root dry matter root respiration rate and yield were significantly improved under the rf2150 treatment but there were no significant differences when the rainwater increased from 200 to 275 mm under both cultivation modes therefore we suggested that the rf2150 treatment could be a suitable water saving strategy to enhance root growth root spatial and temporal distribution and produce maximum grain yield and decrease risks to winter wheat productivity under

11338,knowledge of rooting systems and soil water status across rooting zones is important for stabilizing agricultural productivity in the semi arid regions of china in the present study a mobile rainproof shelter trial was performed to find out the effects of cultivation mode on the temporal and spatial root growth distribution soil water content root respiration rate and grain yield during 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 growing seasons the two cultivation modes were 1 the ridge furrow rf rainfall harvesting technique and 2 traditional flat planting tf in addition three simulated rainfall 1 275 2 200 3 125 mm and two deficit irrigation 150 75 mm levels were used our results showed that different cultivation modes with simulated precipitation levels significantly improved moisture content for wheat growth improved root growth and provided favourable conditions for higher wheat production the rf150 treatment with 200 mm rainfall significantly increased morphology of the wheat rooting system especially in the top 40 cm soil layer compared with tf cultivation the rf150 treatment significantly increased root dry weight 47 root tissue density 6 7 root fineness 4 8 root length ratio 20 3 root mass ratio 27 3 and grain yield 18 9 of wheat at 200 mm rainfall than that of tf2150 treatment root weight density root length density root surface area density and root diameter were significantly higher under rf150 treatment with 200 mm and 275 mm precipitation in the 40 cm soil layer and reached maximum values at the flowering stage the root dry weight root respiration rate and grain yield were significantly improved under rf2150 treatment but there were no significant differences when the rainwater increased from 200 to 275 mm under both cultivation modes therefore we suggested that the rf2150 treatment is a suitable water saving strategy to improve temporal and spatial root growth distribution resulting in higher grain yield in a dry land farming system keywords cultivation modes rainfall simulator grain yield root morphology root respiration rate soil water content 1 introduction water availability is the most essential limiting factor for wheat crop production in rain fed areas of china gan et al 2008 in these regions precipitation is the most important water source for agricultural development and production du et al 2015 and inadequate or unpredictable rainfall often results in low crop productivity and sometimes total crop failure wang et al 2011a the seasonal evapotranspiration et rate in these regions ranges from 750 to 1000 mm which is considerably higher than the annual precipitation rate 250 550 mm ren et al 2010 however 70 of groundwater resources in these areas are used for agricultural production zhao et al 2013 the water table has been affected by deep irrigation and misuse of groundwater resources currell et al 2012 and has decreased by 0 5 3 m year in the northwest part of china over the last 20 years du et al 2015 thus it is essential to apply efficient water saving agriculture strategies to not only efficiently store soil water from small precipitation events but also efficiently store rainfall water in root zones of crop for use during drought phases to attain higher crop productivity shao et al 2011 precipitation harvesting techniques with plastic film mulching have been implemented in rain fed regions of china to store rainfall for later crop use wang et al 2009 several practices have been used to trap rainfall water wang et al 2011b of these practices the ridge furrow rf precipitation harvesting method with plastic film has been recommended as one of the most efficient to optimize crop productivity chakraborty et al 2008 the ridge covered with plastic film mulch can conserve more rainwater extend the period of water accessibility and improve crop productivity by saving rainwater from light precipitation and by retaining surface runoff from heavy precipitation as compared with traditional flat planting wang et al 2009 the rf system with ridge covered with plastic film significantly increased water content crop productivity and wue in semi arid zones xiao et al 2007 but very limited research has been conducted on root growth and its association with soil moisture availability in winter wheat under the rf system with plastic film to attain higher crop productivity in semi arid regions knowledge of root morphology is essential liu et al 2011 roots of the winter wheat crop have a significant role in sensing ecological modifications and conveying that information to the aboveground parts of the plant to provoke suitable adaptive responses such as changes in root morphology and metabolic activity to optimize the consumption of limited water resources chaves et al 2003 the roots of the winter wheat crop are the most significant organ for nutrient and rainwater uptake and have a vital role in the plant and soil ecosystem spedding et al 2004 zhang et al 2014 thus the relationships of soil water and crop rooting systems have been studied more intensely in recent years soil water has been found to enhance the accessibility of nutrients and nutrients enhance root growth and crop productivity besharat et al 2010 root growth and distribution heavily influence water and nutrient uptake in winter wheat crops li et al 2010 the main root morphological features of winter wheat are root weight density root length density root surface area density root diameter and root respiration rate all of which directly affect the function of the whole root system and indirectly affect aboveground biomass accumulation xia et al 2005 fageria 2004 water scarcity decreases uptake of nutrients and limits root growth and distribution araki et al 2012 corn grown under the rf system with deficit irrigation conditions produced higher root length root diameter and root weight density which improved nutrient and water uptake capacity and thus decreased water deficit stress and improve corn yields shen et al 2013 the rf system with simulated precipitation conditions significantly affected soil water storage in corn significantly increased root penetration and thus produced higher root length density and increased soil and root respiration rates which finally improved characteristics of spike and maize production gan et al 2013 root length is an important aspect for assessing the rf cultivation mode under deficit irrigation li et al 2001 mosaddeghi et al 2009 however there have been limited studies on the mechanisms to improve wheat productivity through modify root growth and root respiration rate under the rf mode with simulated rainfall and deficit irrigation conditions thus the objectives of this field based trial were to i determine temporal and spatial root morphological growth of winter wheat under different cultivation modes with deficit irrigation ii estimate soil water contents at different depths root and soil respiration rates under simulated rainfall conditions and iii study the interactive effect of cultivation modes with deficit irrigation on root growth root respiration rate moisture content and production of wheat under simulated rainfall conditions and to reduce drought in a rain fed regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the field study was performed during 2015 2017 at the northwest a f

ridge widths of 60 40 cm a plastic film was used to cover all ridges with hidden edges 4 5 cm deep in the soil four rows of wheat were sown in furrows the length and width of each cemented pond plot was 3 15 m 2 0 m with and 3 m in depth and plots were split divided by 17 cm thick concrete walls to avoid the exchange of soil water contents between plots weeds were controlled manually during each growing season of the winter wheat crop wheat cultivar xinong 979 was sown at the rate of 2 25 106 seeds ha 1 the seeds were planted with an inter row space of 20 cm on october 15 2015 and on october

intra row spots each core was taken at 10 cm increments down to 90 cm soil depth the soil sample was poured into a 0 25 mm2 mesh sieve and roots were gently washed with tap water until they were free of soil the live roots white colour and dead roots dark colour on the sieve were carefully separated according to gregory 1994 root images from each soil core section were obtained using a scanner epson v700 indonesia to determine root length root surface area and root diameter root images were analysed using winrhizo software version 5 0 canada according to li et al 2010 the root dry weight

was fixed in the middle of each furrow for soil water content swc measurements moisture content of the 0 2 m soil profile at 20 cm intervals were recorded using a tdr meter time domain reflectometry germany 2 3 3 soil and root respiration rate soil and root respiration chambers were separately installed in the soil 24 h before the experiment the green plants were cut off and the soil was disturbed as little as possible to minimize the influence of soil disturbance and root damage measurements of soil and root respiration were taken using an li 8100 automated soil co2 flux system connected with temperature and moisture sensors measurements were taken at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages of the winter wheat crop 2 3 4 winter wheat production four central rows of winter wheat were hand harvested from each plot to measure grain yield the grain yield was calculated including the combined area of the ridges and furrows 2 3 5 statistical analysis data from each sampling event were analysed individually with anova in spss version 18 0 means were tested with a least significant difference test lsd at p 0 05 the variations in rwd rld rsd root diameter soil and

for all soil layer depths were determined in the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 study years fig 1 values for the 2015 2016 study year are not presented because they were not significantly different from those obtained for the 2016 2017 study year rwd is one of the key parameters used to evaluate the winter wheat rooting system cultivation modes with simulated rainfall conditions and deficit irrigation significantly affected rwd across 0 90 cm layer of soil at flowering and harvesting growth stages fig 1 rwd under the rf150 treatment with 200 mm and 275 mm precipitation was significantly higher than in the tf150 treatment with 125 mm simulated rainfall at the depth of 0 40 cm at the flowering stage there was no significant variation in rwd over the 50 90 cm soil layers among all treatments at the flowering stage at the harvesting stage under the rf150 treatment with 200 mm precipitation the rwd was significantly greater than the tf150 treatment with 125 mm simulated rainfall over the 0 30 cm soil profile in contrast rwd decreased more in the tf150 treatment compared to the tf75 treatment at 125 mm simulated rainfall in all soil profiles during flowering and harvesting stages at the maturity stage rwd was reduced under all treatments and in all soil layers compared to the flowering stage but the decrease was smaller in the rf150 treatment at 200 mm and 275 mm simulated rainfall conditions compared to the tf150 and tf75 treatments respectively the rwd of winter wheat at the depths of 0 90 cm increased and reached a maximum at the flowering stage followed by a slow decline starting at the maturity stage 3 2 root length density rld and root surface area density rsd the rld is a fundamental determinant of soil nutrient acquisition and water uptake in winter wheat in the current study winter wheat rld slowly decreased from flowering to maturity stage across the 0 90 cm soil layer depths the majority of winter wheat roots were concentrated in the uppermost soil profile 0 50 cm where water was adequate under the rf cultivation mode than that of tf cultivation the rld was significantly higher under the rf cultivation mode than that of tf cultivation mode for most soil layer depths at the flowering and maturity stages fig 2 the rf150 treatment with 200 mm and 275 mm precipitation concentrations had significantly higher rld than that of tf cultivation mode at the flowering and maturity stages at the flowering and maturity stages of winter wheat rld in the uppermost soil layer 10 30 cm showed obvious variations under both cultivation modes with different deficit irrigation and rainfall levels the maximum rld was calculated under rf1150 treatments followed by rf2150 treatments across the root zone soil layer 0 40 cm at the flowering stage among all the treatments there were no significant differences in rld at the depths of 50 90 cm at the flowering stage and maturity stage under different cultivation modes with deficit irrigation and simulated precipitation conditions rsd had a similar trend to rld at the depths of 0 90 cm fig 3 rsd under the rf system was significantly higher compared to the tf cultivation mode at the depths of 0 90 cm the rf150 treatment with 200 mm and 275 mm precipitation levels produced significantly higher rsd across 0 60 cm soil profile depths compared to tf cultivation at the flowering stage among all treatments no significant differences in rsd were recorded across 60 90 cm soil depths at the flowering stage while at the maturity stage there were no significant differences in rsd were recorded across 30 90 cm soil depth at the maturity stage the rsd was significantly higher under the rf1150 treatment followed by the rf2150 treatment compared to the tf cultivation mode in the 10 20 cm soil layer 3 3 root diameter cm and root dry weight g per plant roots of the winter wheat crop under the rf cultivation mode with different precipitation conditions had a thicker diameter than in the tf cultivation mode fig 4 a thicker root diameter was recorded under the rf150 treatment with 275 mm simulated rainfall compared to tf cultivation at the depths of 0 90 cm at the flowering stage while at harvesting stage the root diameter gradually reduced among all the treatments except rf1150 treatment the rf150 treatment with 200 mm and 275 mm precipitation produced a significantly thicker root

from 200 mm to 275 mm under both cultivation modes 3 4 morphology of winter wheat rooting system the root morphology parameters root tissue density root fineness root length ratio and root mass ratio were significantly p 0 05 different under rf cultivation with different precipitation and deficit irrigation levels compared to tf cultivation at the harvesting stage table 4 the rf1150 treatment significantly increased the root tissue density 3 3 root fineness 13 7 root length ratio 12 5 and root mass ratio 9 1 compared to the tf1150 treatment the root tissue density root fineness root length ratio and root mass ratio for the rf2150 treatment were significantly increased by 6 7 4 8 20 3 and 27 3 respectively compared to the tf2150 treatment compared with the tf3150 treatment root tissue density root fineness root length ratio and root mass ratio for the rf3150 treatment were significantly increased by 22 6 8 9 8 8 and 18 2 respectively the root tissue density root length ratio and root mass ratio were not significantly different between rf1150 and rf2150 treatments 3 5 soil water content and root respiration rate μmol m 2 s 1 the rf system retained significantly higher soil water content swc at critical growth stages of the winter wheat crop at soil depths of 0 200 cm compared to tf cultivation fig 5 the differences between the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were not significant at a depth of 0 200 cm during the flowering filling and harvesting stages the swc significantly increased at the 0 60 cm soil depth during the flowering and grain filling stages but swc significantly decreased at soil depths of 60 200 cm under both cultivation modes in addition under both cultivation modes the moisture content increased as the precipitation and deficit irrigation amounts increased the moisture content under the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were considerably maximum than the rest of the treatments at the flowering filling and harvesting stages under the rf system the moisture content significantly increased compared to tf cultivation at depths of 0 80 cm during the maturity stage this indicated that the winter wheat crop under the rf system took up less water from deeper soil compared to tf cultivation the soil and root respiration rates at critical growth stages of the wheat crop were considerably improved under the rf method compared to the tf cultivation mode with different precipitation and irrigation conditions table 3 under the rf150 treatment the soil and root respiration rates were not significantly different at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages with 200 mm and 275 mm rainfall levels at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages the soil respiration rates under the rf1150 treatment were greater by 10 6 40 1 and 34 9 respectively and the root respiration rates were greater by 28 1 26 8 and 48 6 respectively compared to the tf1150 treatment under the rf2150 treatment the soil respiration rates at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages were greater by 7 5 23 0 and 34 3 respectively and the root respiration rates were greater by 31 2 35 3 and 23 3 respectively compared to the tf2150 treatment 3 6 winter wheat production the rf cultivation mode with different irrigation and rainfall conditions significantly p 0 05 affected yield production of wheat compared to tf cultivation fig 6 the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments had significantly higher grain yield compared to tf1150 and tf2150 treatments but the grain yield between rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were not significantly the average of two years data explained that the rf cultivation mode improved moisture content soil and root respiration rates and decreased et the grain yield was 15 greater than under the tf cultivation mode the mean grain yield of two years were significantly increased by 10 6 in rf1150 and 12 6 in rf175 compared to tf1150 and tf175 treatments respectively compared with tf2150 and tf275 treatments grain yield of rf2150 and rf275 treatments were significantly increased by 18 9 and 22 5 respectively average grain yield was significantly increased by 14 3 in rf3150 and 8 9 in rf375 treatments than that of tf3150 and tf375 treatments table 4 4 discussion 4 1 effect of cultivation modes with simulated precipitation and deficit irrigation on root growth and distribution wheat roots are the main organ taking up rainwater and nutrients and thus its size and distribution in soil are closely related to its water and nutrient uptake capacity forde and lorenzo 2001 some previous studies have shown that excess or deficit water conditions can change the size and distribution of corn root zones thereby inhibiting root growth liu et al 2009 in winter wheat ridges covered with plastic mulch allow for efficient use of light rainfall by enhancing water accessibility compared to conventional flat planting without mulching as a result enhancing root growth and distributions han et al 2015 in the rf system rainwater penetrated deeper resulting in less evaporation and leading to improved water accessibility for the maize crop over the long term liu et al 2009 the rf system increases moisture content at the depths of 0 60 cm enhancing maize root growth development and distributions jia et al 2018 rld and rsd are key parameters for characterizing winter wheat root systems mosaddeghi et al 2009 vertical root growth has a large effect on water and nutrient uptake capabilities of wheat doussan et al 2006 the rf cultivation mode can affect water accessibility to crops mostly through deeper rainwater infiltration in the furrow zone which improved rld and rsd mu noz romero et al 2010 rld and rsd are significantly greater under the rf cultivation mode than that of tf cultivation mode at depths of 10 50 cm furthermore there is no significant variation in rld and rsd under both cultivation modes below 50 cm qin et al 2006 in the current study we found that the rld and rsd slowly decreased from flowering to maturity stage at the depths of 0 90 cm the rld and rsd were considerably greater under the rf system compared to tf cultivation for most of the soil layer depths at the flowering and maturity stages figs 2 3 the maximum rld and rsd occurred under rf1150 followed by rf2150 treatments at soil depths of 0 40 cm at the flowering stage there were no significant differences in rld and rsd at 50 90 cm soil depths at the flowering stage while at the maturity stage there were no significant differences in rld and rsd of 30 90 cm soil depths our results agree with fang et al 2011 under the rf system moisture content was significantly improved in the uppermost soil layer which markedly influenced the root growth and its distribution and as a result improved rld and rsd compared to tf planting fageria 2004 yuhong et al 2014 reported that about 80 of the total rld and rsd are accumulated in the 40 cm top soil depth under high moisture conditions root diameter and length are important morphological root parameters that affect uptake of water and nutrients ren et al 2008 root diameter had a significant influence on deeper root penetration in soil li et al 2010 allowing higher uptake if water from deeper in the soil profile in the rain fed regions of australia li et al 2001 confirmed that root diameter and length of wheat highly depended on water availability in our study we found that a thicker root diameter of wheat crop was recorded under the rf150 treatment compared to tf cultivation with 275 mm simulated rainfall at depths of 0 90 cm at the flowering stage while at the harvesting stage the root diameter slowly reduced among all the treatments except rf1150 treatment fig 4 the rf150 treatment with 200 mm and 275 mm precipitation conditions produced considerably thicker root diameter across the 10 20 cm soil layer at the flowering and harvesting stage at the 125 mm rainfall level under both cultivation modes the root diameter was not significantly different across the 20 90 cm soil layer depth at the flowering and maturity stages a wide root system supports the crops by reducing drought stress chenyang et al 2014 guo et al 2001 also confirmed that drought stress could prevent root growth and plays a significant role in root morphology of wheat crop the root morphological parameters were significantly p 0 05 different in the rf cultivation mode with different rainfall and deficit irrigation conditions compared to the tf cultivation mode at the harvesting stage table 3 the root tissue density root fineness root length ratio and root mass ratio for the rf2150 treatment were significantly increased by 6 7 4 8 20 3 and 27 3 respectively compared to the tf2150 treatment but the root tissue density root length ratio and root mass ratio were not significantly different between the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments 4 2 effect of cultivation mode on root weight density the response of the wheat rooting system to cultivation modes and variable soil factors can be complex chenyang et al 2014 in a previous study plastic mulching improved soil structure soil temperatures moisture content and nutrients fang et al 2011 this leads to an improvement in lateral root growth and in water and nutrient uptake increasing rwd and root dry matter per plant xue et al 2003 sharratt and gesch 2004 more frequently irrigated wheat has higher rwd than wheat in non irrigated treatments xue et al 2003 our results illustrated that rf150 with 200 mm and 275 mm precipitation increased rwd compared to tf150 treatment with 200 mm and 275 mm at a depth of 0 40 cm at the flowering stage there was no significant variation in rwd at a depth of 50 90 cm at the flowering stage in contrast rwd decreased more under the tf150 treatment compared to the tf75 treatment at 125 mm rainfall in all soil profiles during the flowering and harvesting stage the rwd of wheat at a depth of 0 90 cm increased faster and reached a maximum at the flowering stage followed by a slow decrease at the maturity stage zhang et al 2009 determined that maximum shoot dry matter is significantly related to maximum root dry matter which contributes to maximum crop production our study also showed that root dry matter g per plant for rf2150 tf2150 and rf275 were significantly increased by 72 17 and 14 respectively compared to tf275 treatment there was no significant variation in root dry matter g per plant under 150 mm irrigation when increasing the rainfall from 200 mm to 275 mm under both cultivation modes as reported by sheng et al 2012 root and total biomass plant 1 were significantly higher under the rf cultivation mode compared to tf planting 4 3 effect of cultivation mode on soil water content respiration rate and grain yield wang et al 2012 reported that ridges covered with plastic mulch decreased precipitation water losses and evaporation and increased water content ridges covered with plastic mulch significantly raised moisture content due to increased rainfall harvesting productivities compared to the ridge furrow cultivation mode ren et al 2016 we also found that under the rf method retained higher soil water content at critical growth stages of wheat crop at soil depths of 0 200 cm compared to tf cultivation fig 5 the swc significantly increased at 0 60 cm soil depth during flowering and grain filling stages while in the 60 200 cm soil depths the swc decreased under both cultivation modes in addition under both cultivation modes the moisture content increased as the precipitation and deficit irrigation amounts increased under the rf system winter wheat crop took up less water from the deeper soil profile compared to tf cultivation the rf method with 440 340 and 230 mm precipitation increased maize grain yields by 80 44 and 12 ramakrishna et al 2006 the rf cultivation mode enhanced moisture content at critical growth stages of wheat which enhanced wheat productivity wang et al 2011b in the present study under the rf cultivation mode with different rainfall and irrigation levels significantly affected the grain yield of wheat fig 6 the rf method enhanced soil water content soil and root respiration rates and reduced et therefore the grain yield was 15 higher than that of tf cultivation mode our results are consistent with ren et al 2016 fang et al 2011 also confirmed that plastic film mulching with 340 mm simulated rainfall conditions improved moisture content decreased soil evaporation and increased crop transpiration and grain yield soil respiration is mostly produced by microbial oxidation of organic matter and root respiration and is an important sign of soil quality moisture content and root morphological characteristics pan et al 2003 our study also showed that the soil and root respiration rates were significantly higher under the rf cultivation mode than that of tf cultivation table 2 under the rf150 treatment the soil and root respiration rates were not significantly different at jointing flowering and grain filling stages with 200 mm and 275 mm rainfall levels under the rf2150 treatment the soil and root respiration rates at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages were greater than that of tf2150 treatment wang et al 2011a also found that the soil and root respiration rates significantly improved with increasing irrigation under the rf system but over irrigation reduced soil and root respiration rate zhang et al 2014 also confirmed that under heavy rainfall soil and root respiration was inhibited while the wet growing season chen et al 2013 suppressed the soil respiration rate by 33 therefore we recommend that the rf2150 treatment could be a suitable water saving strategy to enhance root growth root spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of spike and produce maximum grain yield 5 conclusions based on the results of the current study we conclude that rf cultivation mode with simulated rainfall concentrations and deficit irrigations significantly improved soil water content for wheat growth promoted root growth and thus provided favourable conditions for wheat high yield the rf150 treatment with 200 mm rainfall significantly enhanced morphology of the winter wheat rooting system especially at the 40 cm top soil layer compared to tf planting the rf150 treatment significantly improved root dry matter root tissue density root fineness root length ratio and root mass ratio of winter wheat at 200 mm and 275 mm rainfall levels rwd rld and rsd were significantly greater under the rf150 with 200 mm and 275 mm at the 40 cm top soil layer and reached a maximum value at the flowering stage compared with flat cultivation the root dry matter root respiration rate and yield were significantly improved under the rf2150 treatment but there were no significant differences when the rainwater increased from 200 to 275 mm under both cultivation modes therefore we suggested that the rf2150 treatment could be a suitable water saving strategy to enhance root growth root spatial and temporal distribution and produce maximum grain yield and decrease risks to winter wheat productivity under

11339,development of sustainable and efficient irrigation strategies is a priority for producers faced with water shortages a promising management strategy for improving irrigation water use efficiency iwue is deficit irrigation which attempts to optimize yield and iwue soil water use crop yield and iwue of tomato were evaluated for two consecutive years under two types of irrigation methods subsurface and surface drip irrigation and three irrigation strategies 1 0 of full irrigation supply t1 0 8 of full irrigation supply t2 and 0 6 of full irrigation supply t3 the results showed that the highest yields were found in the plots irrigated by subsurface drip irrigation at t1 94 1 ton ha and t2 81 4 ton ha conversely the fully stressed treatment t3 reduced the amount of irrigation water by 40 but significantly decreased mean tomato yield by 25 6 and 26 1 under subsurface and surface drip irrigation respectively as compared to t1 the maximum iwue tended to be higher for subsurface drip than for surface drip irrigation system the greatest iwues were obtained from subsurface drip and surface drip at t3 19 7 kg m3 and 18 3 kg m3 whereas the lowest iwues were those estimated in t1 15 9 kg m3 and 14 8 kg m3 respectively the primary conclusion is that deficit irrigation strategies present certain advantages to crop water management with minimal effects on production and quality thus contributing to crop sustainability keywords subsurface drip irrigation deficit irrigation irrigation water use efficiency tomato water saving 1 introduction saudi arabia one of the driest and hottest countries in the world is roughly located between north latitudes 17 and 31 and east longitudes 37 and 56 temperatures can reach more than 50 c 122 f in some areas producing overwhelmingly hot and dry conditions long term average rainfall across the country is 114 mm per year denicola et al 2015 high temperatures and low precipitation together with high variability of both factors increase evapotranspiration reduce soil moisture and damage the soil by mechanical weathering alkolibi 2002 these conditions have a negative impact on agriculture and water availability which made saudi arabia a very poor country in terms of agricultural potential and water resources the country has scanty rains and no lakes rivers or streams total municipal water use in saudi arabia is about 9 agriculture accounts for 88 and industry consumes only 3 of the available water al zahrani and baig 2011 mismanagement of water use in the agricultural sector and an increasingly westernized and consumerism based shift in lifestyle are mostly to blame for saudi arabia s water starved status as precious groundwater sources have been injudiciously used over many years to the point of depletion achieving greater irrigation water use efficiency iwue is a primary challenge and it includes the employment of techniques and practices that deliver irrigation water to the crops more accurately in this context a combination of deficit irrigation di surface drip irrigation sdi and subsurface drip irrigation ssdi may play an important role in increasing iwue di is a water conservation technique that exposes crops to a particular level of water stress during a certain developmental phase or throughout the entire growing season without a significant reduction in yield pereira et al 2012 the risk of di is low because the response curve of crop yield to water supply often has a wide plateau and a considerable amount of water can be saved without a significant yield reduction compared with full irrigation zhang 2003 kumar et al 2007 studied the effect of di on water saving and onion yield they demonstrated that applying 80 and 60 of crop water requirements bring about yield reductions of 14 and 38 and saved 18 and 33 of irrigation water compared to full irrigation within 2 years respectively patanè et al 2011 indicted that applying a 50 reduction in crop water for the entire or even partial growing season helps reduce fruit losses and maintain a high fruit quality according to nahar and gretzmacher 2002 glucose fructose sucrose malic acid ascorbic acid and citric acid content increased significantly with water stress besides di reduces production costs conserves water and minimizes leaching of nutrients and pesticides in to ground water nuruddin et al 2003 the use of pressurized irrigation system applying water through an emitter on soil surface sdi or below the soil surface ssdi at a small operational pressure and minimizing soil evaporation has been popular for saving water and improving iwue camp 1998 lamm et al 1995 ayars et al 2015 cui et al 2008 pointed out sdi and ssdi can improve iwue by 26 7 46 4 and fruit quality of table grape without detrimental effect on the fruit yield in arid region hassanli et al 2009 conducted a comparison between three irrigation methods sdi ssdi and furrow irrigation the results demonstrated that the minimum amount of water along with highest use efficiency is delivered through ssdi and sdi respectively del amor and del amor 2007 performed a comparison between sdi and ssdi systems they found that higher tomato crop yields were achieved by ssdi as compared to sdi in sandy soil similarly al omran et al 2010 concluded that ssdi increased the iwue and yield of their tomato crop by producing a good moisture distribution in the root zone leading to a conservation of irrigation water information on deficit irrigation scheduling is limited for many crops especially tomato which is a vital horticultural crop within arid regions maas and hoffman 1977 accordingly in light of water limitations there is a necessity to establish different irrigation strategies that may facilitate the conservation of water under both high evaporative demand and chronic shortages without incurring considerably influencing yields for this reason different deficit irrigation approaches have been applied to tomato plants under sdi and ssdi systems considering the issues analyzed above the objectives of the present study are i to evaluate the response of tomato yield and quality to various combinations of di sdi and ssdi and ii to determine the minimum irrigation treatment in tomatoes where the production and crop quality are least affected 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

partitioned into two main fields isolated with buffer zones of 6 m each field was subdivided into nine plots with surface area dimensions of 7 m in width x 10 m in length fig 2 the plots in the first field were irrigated by sdi system whereas ssdi was used to irrigate the plots in the second field the plots in the both fields were irrigated daily with various amounts of water according to the daily reference crop evapotranspiration calculated by the fao penman monteith equation eq 1 fig 3 the irrigation treatments were composed of three approaches t1 100 of crop evapotranspiration t2 80 of crop evapotranspiration and t3 60 of crop evapotranspiration the amounts of water were recorded at every irrigation event through multi jet dry dial water meters settled along the sub main lines 1 et

the seedlings were cultivated in a single row with a line spacing of 0 8 m and an interplant spacing of 0 4 m the tomato plants were grown for about 97 days which as divided into four stages namely initial 20 days development 30 days middle 32 days and late season 15 days the crop coefficients during the crop season were 0 70 1 15 0 90 and 0 75 during the initial developmental middle and late season stages respectively allen et al 1998 all plots received a basic application of 300 kg n ha and 100 kg k2so4 ha herbicides and insecticides were applied to each plot when necessary the plant height number of branches fresh leaf weight fresh stem weight and fresh plant weight were determined leaf samples were collected washed in distilled water and dried at 70 c in forced air oven until

spss version 20 0 software the least significant differences method lsd was used to differentiate the means at a significance level of p 0 05 snedecor and cochran 1989 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water status fig 4 shows the average volumetric water content vwc data in response to the different irrigation treatments under sdi and ssdi in 2015 and 2016 as shown in fig 4 the moisture distribution was directly associated with the amount of water added to whether full t1 or deficit irrigated t2 and t3 treatments the vwc values during the initial stage until 20 days after planting were high and similar to each other in sdi and ssdi this was due to the large amount of water that had been applied during the transplanting stage the vwc values at depths of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m were either above or near the field capacity not shown after starting the irrigation treatments the level of vwc was the highest in the t1 treatment followed by the t2 and t3 treatments in both sdi and ssdi systems the relative increase of vwc for t1 in sdi and ssdi that was observed after 30 days after planting was the result of initiation in the tomato soil moisture measurements at 60 days after planting had significant variation in vwc when t1 t2 and t3 were compared for example the values of vwc in the plots irrigated with t1 under sdi and ssdi were on average 22 and 24 5 as compared to t2 18 and 19 and t3 17 and 16 respectively at the beginning of the leaf yellowing stage 80 days after planting vwc values in the irrigation treatments were reduced due to ripening of tomatoes overall greater moisture content below the soil surface with buried drip tape ssdi was captured for tomato to be advantageous by reducing evaporation camp 1998 reported similar conditions in the surface of a sandy loam when drip tape was buried at 0 1 m depth 3 2 water use by the crop fig 5 shows the average amount of water applied to the fully and deficit irrigated plots under ssdi and sdi in 2015 and 2016 during the initial stage the maximum irrigation depths added to the plots t1 t2 and t3 under ssdi and sdi were few as they were 5 5 and 5 8 mm 4 4 and 4 6 mm and 3 3 and 3 4 mm per day respectively in the development stage there was a slight increase in the depths of water applied due to the flowering of tomatoes during the mid season stage there was a steady increase in the amount of water applied where the maximum irrigation depths reached 10 mm 8 mm and 6 mm in the plots t1 t2 and t3 respectively under ssdi this is mainly because increasing the temperature and forming the tomatoes correspondingly the increases in irrigation depths for the plots t1 t2 and t3 under sdi throughout the same period were 10 4 mm 8 3 mm and 6 2 mm respectively during the late season stage the depth of irrigation decreased due to the maturity of the tomatoes where it reached 7 4 mm 6 mm and 4 5 mm in the plots t1 t2 and t3 irrigated by ssdi respectively similarly the irrigation depth decreases in the plots t1 t2 and t3 those irrigated by sdi were 7 8 mm 6 2 mm and 4 6 mm respectively 3 3 comparison of vegetative growth the response of the tomato crop during the two years demonstrated that variations within the amount of water applied using different combinations of deficit irrigation significantly affected the vegetative growth traits table 2 the maximum values of the mean vegetative growth characteristics during the two years were found in t1 ssdi and t1 sdi systems the analysis results showed that the average estimations of plant height the number of branches fresh leaf weight g fresh stem weight g fresh plant weight g dry leaf weight g dry stem weight g and dry plant weight g were considerably enhanced by 24 39 27 15 26 27 25 and 24 when t1 ssdi is used as compared to t3 ssdi respectively similarly the increases within the corresponding vegetative traits in t1 sdi were 27 41 26 15 28 27 27 and 26 respectively as compared to t3 sdi this is mainly due to 1 the amount of water applied at 100 crop evapotranspiration sufficiently met the crop water demand and 2 the equal distribution of water and nutrients delivered through the ssdi system 3 4 comparison of fruit yield the average values of the yield traits during 2015 and 2016 were in order of t1 ssdi t1 sdi t2 ssdi t2 sdi t3 ssdi and t3 sdi respectively table 3 this can be attributed to the higher amount of water used within the fully irrigated plots on the one hand and the lower amount of evaporation losses from ssdi on the other the results obtained from table 3 show that the average values of the total yields were significantly decreased by 13 47 and 25 66 for t2 ssdi and t3 ssdi respectively as compared to t1 ssdi similarly the decreases in total yield from t2 sdi and t3 sdi were 14 23 and 26 13 respectively as compared to t1 sdi 3 5 fruit quality characteristics the tomato crop showed a significant difference in fruit quality characteristics fruit length fruit diameter dry matter total soluble solidity vitamin c and total acidity as a result of the various irrigation treatments table 4 table 4 shows that the maximum values of fruit quality during 2015 and 2016 were obtained from t1 ssdi and t1 sdi in a similar way t2 sdi and t2 ssdi showed a comparable pattern but were of lower quality than t1 ssdi and t1 sdi this may be due to the fact that the fully irrigated plots received much more water than the deficit irrigated plots these results are in concurrence with the findings reported by machado et al 2003 del amor and del amor 2007 wang et al 2010 and al omran et al 2010 3 6 yield reductions and water saving table 5 compares the yield reduction and decrease in water use for the two types of irrigation methods sdi and ssdi and three irrigation procedures t1 t2 and t3 as can be seen from table 5 the greatest reduction in fruit yield 26 13 and 25 6 was obtained from the lowest irrigation treatment t3 for both irrigation systems sdi and ssdi respectively at the same time the irrigation treatment t3 saved about 40 of irrigation water the moderate irrigation treatment t2 saved about 20 of irrigation water and obtained the lowest reduction in fruit yield 14 23 and 13 4 for both sdi and ssdi systems respectively as compared to t1 these results are in conformity with those obtained by ozbahce and tari 2010 and djurović et al 2016 3 7 irrigation water use efficiency fig 6 shows the iwue for the fully and deficit irrigated treatments clearly the fully irrigated treatments showed a decrease in iwue compared to the deficit irrigated treatments which greatly improved the iwue in the tomato crop as shown in fig 6 the greatest iwue was obtained from t3 ssdi 19 7 kg m3 and t3 sdi 18 3 kg m3 conversely the lowest iwue 15 9 and 14 8 kg m3 was found in t1 ssdi and t1 sdi respectively these findings are in congruity with those obtained by beuhler 2003 and simonovic and li 2003 who suggested that improving iwue is a basic demand to guarantee the accessibility of water for both food production and competing human needs under future climate change 4 conclusions today irrigation is the largest single consumer on the earth competition for water from other sectors will force irrigation to operate under water scarcity in field crops a well designed deficit irrigation can optimize water productivity over an area when full irrigation is not possible our results have clearly shown that the adoption of modern irrigation systems combined with deficit irrigation strategies can improve both the irrigation water use

11339,development of sustainable and efficient irrigation strategies is a priority for producers faced with water shortages a promising management strategy for improving irrigation water use efficiency iwue is deficit irrigation which attempts to optimize yield and iwue soil water use crop yield and iwue of tomato were evaluated for two consecutive years under two types of irrigation methods subsurface and surface drip irrigation and three irrigation strategies 1 0 of full irrigation supply t1 0 8 of full irrigation supply t2 and 0 6 of full irrigation supply t3 the results showed that the highest yields were found in the plots irrigated by subsurface drip irrigation at t1 94 1 ton ha and t2 81 4 ton ha conversely the fully stressed treatment t3 reduced the amount of irrigation water by 40 but significantly decreased mean tomato yield by 25 6 and 26 1 under subsurface and surface drip irrigation respectively as compared to t1 the maximum iwue tended to be higher for subsurface drip than for surface drip irrigation system the greatest iwues were obtained from subsurface drip and surface drip at t3 19 7 kg m3 and 18 3 kg m3 whereas the lowest iwues were those estimated in t1 15 9 kg m3 and 14 8 kg m3 respectively the primary conclusion is that deficit irrigation strategies present certain advantages to crop water management with minimal effects on production and quality thus contributing to crop sustainability keywords subsurface drip irrigation deficit irrigation irrigation water use efficiency tomato water saving 1 introduction saudi arabia one of the driest and hottest countries in the world is roughly located between north latitudes 17 and 31 and east longitudes 37 and 56 temperatures can reach more than 50 c 122 f in some areas producing overwhelmingly hot and dry conditions long term average rainfall across the country is 114 mm per year denicola et al 2015 high temperatures and low precipitation together with high variability of both factors increase evapotranspiration reduce soil moisture and damage the soil by mechanical weathering alkolibi 2002 these conditions have a negative impact on agriculture and water availability which made saudi arabia a very poor country in terms of agricultural potential and water resources the country has scanty rains and no lakes rivers or streams total municipal water use in saudi arabia is about 9 agriculture accounts for 88 and industry consumes only 3 of the available water al zahrani and baig 2011 mismanagement of water use in the agricultural sector and an increasingly westernized and consumerism based shift in lifestyle are mostly to blame for saudi arabia s water starved status as precious groundwater sources have been injudiciously used over many years to the point of depletion achieving greater irrigation water use efficiency iwue is a primary challenge and it includes the employment of techniques and practices that deliver irrigation water to the crops more accurately in this context a combination of deficit irrigation di surface drip irrigation sdi and subsurface drip irrigation ssdi may play an important role in increasing iwue di is a water conservation technique that exposes crops to a particular level of water stress during a certain developmental phase or throughout the entire growing season without a significant reduction in yield pereira et al 2012 the risk of di is low because the response curve of crop yield to water supply often has a wide plateau and a considerable amount of water can be saved without a significant yield reduction compared with full irrigation zhang 2003 kumar et al 2007 studied the effect of di on water saving and onion yield they demonstrated that applying 80 and 60 of crop water requirements bring about yield reductions of 14 and 38 and saved 18 and 33 of irrigation water compared to full irrigation within 2 years respectively patanè et al 2011 indicted that applying a 50 reduction in crop water for the entire or even partial growing season helps reduce fruit losses and maintain a high fruit quality according to nahar and gretzmacher 2002 glucose fructose sucrose malic acid ascorbic acid and citric acid content increased significantly with water stress besides di reduces production costs conserves water and minimizes leaching of nutrients and pesticides in to ground water nuruddin et al 2003 the use of pressurized irrigation system applying water through an emitter on soil surface sdi or below the soil surface ssdi at a small operational pressure and minimizing soil evaporation has been popular for saving water and improving iwue camp 1998 lamm et al 1995 ayars et al 2015 cui et al 2008 pointed out sdi and ssdi can improve iwue by 26 7 46 4 and fruit quality of table grape without detrimental effect on the fruit yield in arid region hassanli et al 2009 conducted a comparison between three irrigation methods sdi ssdi and furrow irrigation the results demonstrated that the minimum amount of water along with highest use efficiency is delivered through ssdi and sdi respectively del amor and del amor 2007 performed a comparison between sdi and ssdi systems they found that higher tomato crop yields were achieved by ssdi as compared to sdi in sandy soil similarly al omran et al 2010 concluded that ssdi increased the iwue and yield of their tomato crop by producing a good moisture distribution in the root zone leading to a conservation of irrigation water information on deficit irrigation scheduling is limited for many crops especially tomato which is a vital horticultural crop within arid regions maas and hoffman 1977 accordingly in light of water limitations there is a necessity to establish different irrigation strategies that may facilitate the conservation of water under both high evaporative demand and chronic shortages without incurring considerably influencing yields for this reason different deficit irrigation approaches have been applied to tomato plants under sdi and ssdi systems considering the issues analyzed above the objectives of the present study are i to evaluate the response of tomato yield and quality to various combinations of di sdi and ssdi and ii to determine the minimum irrigation treatment in tomatoes where the production and crop quality are least affected 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were conducted at the experimental site of king saud university riyadh saudi arabia the geographical coordinates of the location are a latitude of 24 43 n longitude of 46 43 4 e and altitude of 635 m the climate in this region is definitely semi arid with an average yearly precipitation of 100 mm during the experimental period the maximum and minimum mean monthly temperatures were 29 74 and 19 94 c in may and february respectively the highest mean relative humidity was 30 29 during april whereas the lowest one was 24 in february other climatic parameters are shown in fig 1 the soil has been classified as sc clayey sand baylot et al 2013 comprising of 72 6 sand 12 75 silt and 14 65 clay soil bulk density was 1 64 1 61 and 1 59 g cm 3 for soil depths at 0 2

partitioned into two main fields isolated with buffer zones of 6 m each field was subdivided into nine plots with surface area dimensions of 7 m in width x 10 m in length fig 2 the plots in the first field were irrigated by sdi system whereas ssdi was used to irrigate the plots in the second field the plots in the both fields were irrigated daily with various amounts of water according to the daily reference crop evapotranspiration calculated by the fao penman monteith equation eq 1 fig 3 the irrigation treatments were composed of three approaches t1 100 of crop evapotranspiration t2 80 of crop evapotranspiration and t3 60 of crop evapotranspiration the amounts of water were recorded at every irrigation event through multi jet dry dial water meters settled along the sub main lines 1 et

content once the experiment initiated the volumetric soil water content was measured daily to a depth of 0 6 m at 0 2 m intervals in each of the irrigation treatments using multi sensor capacitance probes enviroscan the enviroscan device sentek pty ltd stepney australia is a multi sensor capacitance probe measuring water content in different depths of a soil profile a support rod was fitted with several sensors and inserted into a polyvinyl chloride access tube installed in the soil each sensor consists of two conductive rings acting as capacitor with the surrounding medium solid soil air and

the seedlings were cultivated in a single row with a line spacing of 0 8 m and an interplant spacing of 0 4 m the tomato plants were grown for about 97 days which as divided into four stages namely initial 20 days development 30 days middle 32 days and late season 15 days the crop coefficients during the crop season were 0 70 1 15 0 90 and 0 75 during the initial developmental middle and late season stages respectively allen et al 1998 all plots received a basic application of 300 kg n ha and 100 kg k2so4 ha herbicides and insecticides were applied to each plot when necessary the plant height number of branches fresh leaf weight fresh stem weight and fresh plant weight were determined leaf samples were collected washed in distilled water and dried at 70 c in forced air oven until the weight became constant 48 72 h to calculate the dry matter contents the early and total yields were recorded in each treatment for all replications and the data were presented as tons per hectare

randomized block design with 3 replicates all parameters were subjected to analysis of variance anova to evaluate the statistical effect of irrigation treatments on tomato yields and components using spss version 20 0 software the least significant differences method lsd was used to differentiate the means at a significance level of p 0 05 snedecor and cochran 1989 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water status fig 4 shows the average volumetric water content vwc data in response to the different irrigation treatments under sdi and ssdi in 2015 and 2016 as shown in fig 4 the moisture distribution was directly associated with the amount of water added to whether full t1 or deficit irrigated t2 and t3 treatments the vwc values during the initial stage until 20 days after planting were high and similar to each other in sdi and ssdi this was due to the large amount of water that had been applied during the transplanting stage the vwc values at depths of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m were either above or near the field capacity not shown after starting the irrigation treatments the level of vwc was the highest in the t1 treatment followed by the t2 and t3 treatments in both sdi and ssdi systems the relative increase of vwc for t1 in sdi and ssdi that was observed after 30 days after planting was the result of initiation in the tomato soil moisture measurements at 60 days after planting had significant variation in vwc when t1 t2 and t3 were compared for example the values of vwc in the plots irrigated with t1 under sdi and ssdi were on average 22 and 24 5 as compared to t2 18 and 19 and t3 17 and 16 respectively at the beginning of the leaf yellowing stage 80 days after planting vwc values in the irrigation treatments were reduced due to ripening of tomatoes overall greater moisture content below the soil surface with buried drip tape ssdi was captured for tomato to be advantageous by reducing evaporation camp 1998 reported similar conditions in the surface of a sandy loam when drip tape was buried at 0 1 m depth 3 2 water use by the crop fig 5 shows the average amount of water applied to the fully and deficit irrigated plots under ssdi and sdi in 2015 and 2016 during the initial stage the maximum irrigation depths added to the plots t1 t2 and t3 under ssdi and sdi were few as they were 5 5 and 5 8 mm 4 4 and 4 6 mm and 3 3 and 3 4 mm per day respectively in the development stage there was a slight increase in the depths of water applied due to the flowering of tomatoes during the mid season stage there was a steady increase in the amount of water applied where the maximum irrigation depths reached 10 mm 8 mm and 6 mm in the plots t1 t2 and t3 respectively under ssdi this is mainly because increasing the temperature and forming the tomatoes correspondingly the increases in irrigation depths for the plots t1 t2 and t3 under sdi throughout the same period were 10 4 mm 8 3 mm and 6 2 mm respectively during the late season stage the depth of irrigation decreased due to the maturity of the tomatoes where it reached 7 4 mm 6 mm and 4 5 mm in the plots t1 t2 and t3 irrigated by ssdi respectively similarly the irrigation depth decreases in the plots t1 t2 and t3 those irrigated by sdi were 7 8 mm 6 2 mm and 4 6 mm respectively 3 3 comparison of vegetative growth the response of the tomato crop during the two years demonstrated that variations within the amount of water applied using different combinations of deficit irrigation significantly affected the vegetative growth traits table 2 the maximum values of the mean vegetative growth characteristics during the two years were found in t1 ssdi and t1 sdi systems the analysis results showed that the average estimations of plant height the number of branches fresh leaf weight g fresh stem weight g fresh plant weight g dry leaf weight g dry stem weight g and dry plant weight g were considerably enhanced by 24 39 27 15 26 27 25 and 24 when t1 ssdi is used as compared to t3 ssdi respectively similarly the increases within the corresponding vegetative traits in t1 sdi were 27 41 26 15 28 27 27 and 26 respectively as compared to t3 sdi this is mainly due to 1 the amount of water applied at 100 crop evapotranspiration sufficiently met the crop water demand and 2 the equal distribution of water and nutrients delivered through the ssdi system 3 4 comparison of fruit yield the average values of the yield traits during 2015 and 2016 were in order of t1 ssdi t1 sdi t2 ssdi t2 sdi t3 ssdi and t3 sdi respectively table 3 this can be attributed to the higher amount of water used within the fully irrigated plots on the one hand and the lower amount of evaporation losses from ssdi on the other the results obtained from table 3 show that the average values of the total yields were significantly decreased by 13 47 and 25 66 for t2 ssdi and t3 ssdi respectively as compared to t1 ssdi similarly the decreases in total yield from t2 sdi and t3 sdi were 14 23 and 26 13 respectively as compared to t1 sdi 3 5 fruit quality characteristics the tomato crop showed a significant difference in fruit quality characteristics fruit length fruit diameter dry matter total soluble solidity vitamin c and total acidity as a result of the various irrigation treatments table 4 table 4 shows that the maximum values of fruit quality during 2015 and 2016 were obtained from t1 ssdi and t1 sdi in a similar way t2 sdi and t2 ssdi showed a comparable pattern but were of lower quality than t1 ssdi and t1 sdi this may be due to the fact that the fully irrigated plots received much more water than the deficit irrigated plots these results are in concurrence with the findings reported by machado et al 2003 del amor and del amor 2007 wang et al 2010 and al omran et al 2010 3 6 yield reductions and water saving table 5 compares the yield reduction and decrease in water use for the two types of irrigation methods sdi and ssdi and three irrigation procedures t1 t2 and t3 as can be seen from table 5 the greatest reduction in fruit yield 26 13 and 25 6 was obtained from the lowest irrigation treatment t3 for both irrigation systems sdi and ssdi respectively at the same time the irrigation treatment t3 saved about 40 of irrigation water the moderate irrigation treatment t2 saved about 20 of irrigation water and obtained the lowest reduction in fruit yield 14 23 and 13 4 for both sdi and ssdi systems respectively as compared to t1 these results are in conformity with those obtained by ozbahce and tari 2010 and djurović et al 2016 3 7 irrigation water use efficiency fig 6 shows the iwue for the fully and deficit irrigated treatments clearly the fully irrigated treatments showed a decrease in iwue compared to the deficit irrigated treatments which greatly improved the iwue in the tomato crop as shown in fig 6 the greatest iwue was obtained from t3 ssdi 19 7 kg m3 and t3 sdi 18 3 kg m3 conversely the lowest iwue 15 9 and 14 8 kg m3 was found in t1 ssdi and t1 sdi respectively these findings are in congruity with those obtained by beuhler 2003 and simonovic and li 2003 who suggested that improving iwue is a basic demand to guarantee the accessibility of water for both food production and competing human needs under future climate change 4 conclusions today irrigation is the largest single consumer on the earth competition for water from other sectors will force irrigation to operate under water scarcity in field crops a well designed deficit irrigation can optimize water productivity over an area when full irrigation is not possible our results have clearly shown that the adoption of modern irrigation systems combined with deficit irrigation strategies can improve both the irrigation water use efficiency and quality of tomato fruits deficit irrigation will gain more importance over time but farmers must choose crops and irrigation strategies carefully to maximize the value of their crop
