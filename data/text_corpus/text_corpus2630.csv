13150,the surface of graphene oxide go features highly reactive carboxyl epoxy and hydroxyl groups however it cannot remove negatively charged species such as anion metals gadolinium gd ions interact strongly with anionic species such as arsenic the incorporation of gadolinium oxide to go facilitates the removal of anion and cation heavy metals however the product was practically infeasible because to the thin friable and light flakes to address these flaws a polymer combination sodium alginate sa and carboxymethyl cellulose cmc was employed to bind go gd2o3 into granules the ability of which was verified to adsorb cr iii pb ii and as v the effective operating ph dose and temperature were 4 0 1 4 g l and 298 k respectively cr iii pb ii and as v all had adsorption capabilities of 29 16 158 73 and 36 77 mg g demonstrating ggo gd2o3 as effective granules for heavy metals removal from complex aquatic environments according to the thermodynamic data cr iii and as v adsorptions are endothermic but pb ii adsorption is exothermic the probable sorption mechanism was thoroughly discussed the viability of produced materials was assessed by investigating their re usability and use in real surface water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords alginate cmc composite graphene oxide gadolinium oxide heavy metal treatment granular adsorbent 1 introduction heavy metals released into the environment by different manufacturing companies as well as natural contamination are major causes of water pollution across the world 1 heavy metals in surface and groundwater sources have been designated as significant inorganic pollutants in the environment due to their motility in aquatic ecosystems biotransformation and toxicity to higher living forms 2 cr iii pb ii and as v are three major carcinogenic heavy metals that contribute to water contamination as a result of fast industrialization hard acids are formed when cr iii forms strong complexes with oxygen high levels of cr iii in water on the other hand may have severe ecological implications and even some harmful and malignant health effects on the human 3 7 pb ii is a well known toxic heavy metal that causes adverse effects to the human health for example red blood cells transport it to the liver and kidneys where it is subsequently redistributed as lead phosphate to the teeth bones and hair that poisoning can be acute or persistent 6 8 10 arsenic is poisonous to humans animals and plants it inactivates enzymes especially those involved in cellular energy metabolism and dna synthesis and repair 11 16 because of the ongoing global rise in hazardous pollutant exposure researchers are encouraged to discover efficient novel strategies for their removal adsorption is considered one of the most promising ways to eliminate hazardous metals from aqueous solutions because of its ease of use versatility and high efficiency in commercial applications compared to other approaches 17 18 owing their higher specific surface areas and number of active moieties nanomaterials have attracted a great attention and research interest several carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have been utilized to create activated carbon material that remove organic and inorganic contaminants from wastewater 19 graphene is a two dimensional structure composed of a thin layer of hexagon formed carbon its oxidized state known as graphene oxide go includes potent active sites such as hydroxyl carboxyl carbonyl and epoxy groups that interface with polarized contaminants heavy metals were effectively removed utilizing go as the adsorbent demonstrating its adsorption effectiveness 19 21 however extracting because of its great dispensability go recovery from aqueous solutions is challenging as a result researchers are encouraged to investigate alternative configured or hybridized go compounds for water purification to solve this issue moreover the surface modification go can enhances its application feasibility in various field 22 in recent times amino silanes 23 diethylenetriamine 24 mn doped tio2 25 fe3o4 26 27 nife2o4 6 15 28 30 gd2o3 28 31 33 polyvinyl alcohol gd2o3 34 and lanthanum 35 36 have been used to modify go surface in order to use for the removal various pollutants from this literature survey it is understood that the gd2o3 is doped go that enhance stability and adsorption ability for selective removal of pollutants in particularly gd3 exhibits a high selectivity for phosphorus silicon and arsenic like fe3 and al3 that are often used to the arsenic removal 37 this study prompt us to synthesis gd2o3 doped go in this study however go based materials are generated as a powder which is challenging to manage and utilize in practice granulation can help to overcome this constraint polymers such as cellulose chitosan and alginate can serve as excellent binders the interaction between graphene and the polymer causes the mass to aggregate into spherical hydrogel capsules 38 hydrogels are used to encapsulate the materials due to their aqueous interiors and porous structures 39 furthermore polymers act as binding materials and elicit the self assembly of graphene oxide 25 in this work alginate and carboxymethyl cellulose were selected as the polymers to aggregate the gadolinium doped graphene oxide into adsorbent granules sodium alginate sa is mainly made up of mannuronic and guluronic acids and it has a lot of free carboxyl groups 40 on the other hand sodium carboxymethyl cellulose cmc is an anionic high molecular molecule made from natural cellulose and caustic alkali in the presence of acetic acid 41 both polymers can exchange cations with a wide range of divalent and trivalent cations furthermore both polymers are biodegradable biocompatible bioactive easy to mold water soluble and organic solvent insoluble these biopolymers can interacts with go and give a 3d structure contain granular materials 42 that may prevent difficulties of powders in real field application in this work the biopolymers sa and cmc are used to form granules of a graphene oxide nanocomposite that is doped with gadolinium oxide gd2o3 in order avoid difficulty in recovery of powdered form of go materials after sustainable removal of heavy metals such as as v pb ii and cr iii the finalized granular biopolymer encapsulated gd2o3 doped go called as ggo gd2o3 batch and column experiments are performed to optimize the conditions for adsorptive removal of heavy metals also the developed material ggo gd2o3 applied for real surface water treatment and checked its re usability and stability in this study the overall study may suggest the potential applicability and ability to design of wastewater treatment system using ggo gd2o3 2 material and methods 2 1 materials graphite flakes and h2o2 were bought from sigma aldrich in the united states and samchun chemical in korea supplied the nano3 h2so4 kmno4 and gd no3 3 samchun chemical also provided the sodium alginate and carboxymethyl cellulose utilized to create the granular nanocomposite 2 2 preparation of ggo gd2o3 the scheme for the preparation of the material is provided in fig 1 go the core of this synthesis was produced by the hummers method 43 following a previously reported procedure the go gd2o3 nanocomposite was synthesized 33 one gram of as prepared go was distributed in 100 ml of distilled water the gd no3 3 solution was then added to the go solution in such a way that the go and gd3 ion ratio remained at 1 5 w w by homogenizing the mixture with a 5 m naoh solution the ph was adjusted to 10 the temperature was then increased to 353 k and maintained there for 1 h upon completing the thermal treatment the mixture was freeze dried in a freeze dryer fdb 7003 korea the resulting go gd2o3 nanocomposite was light enough to disperse in the water though insoluble the sol gel transition of a biopolymer combination including the go gd2o3 nanocomposite was used to make go gd2o3 granules sa and cmc were dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water by slow mixing to each biopolymer mixture 1 g of go gd2o3 was added and gently mixed using a continuous syringe pump these combinations were slowly added to a 0 5 m cacl2 solution the sol gel transition commenced after the mixture was added and spherical hydrogel particles were produced the granules were subsequently washed and dried using a freeze dryer 2 3 characterization the surface functional groups of ggo gd2o3 were identified by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi quantera ii ulvac phi kanagawa japan and fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrometry irspirit shimadzu corporation japan x ray diffraction xrd d max 2500 rigaku tokyo japan was used to investigate the ggo gd2o3 crystalline structure scanning electron microscopy sem combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds s 4300 with quantax eds bruker germany was used to investigate the surface morphology and elemental composition of the adsorbent the autosorb 1 surface area and pore size analyzer quantachrome instruments boynton beach fl usa was used to calculate the surface area pore volume and pore diameter of the as prepared materials the ultra sonication of go and the go gd2o3 nanocomposites was conducted using a sonics vibracell cv 334 usa inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes perkin elmer usa was used to monitor the concentrations of the metal ions a 340i ph meter was used to take all of the ph readings wtw germany 2 4 adsorption experiments cr no3 3 9h2o pb no3 2 and na2haso4 7h2o were used to make a known amount solution 1000 mg l of cr iii pb ii and as v for the batch test batch tests were conducted using specific amounts of metal solution 0 100 mg l and a constant amount of ggo gd2o3 which was optimized by experiments performed under predetermined conditions in 50 ml falcon tubes at fixed ph and different temperatures to investigate the time required to achieve equilibrium for each run following equilibration the metal was collected by filtering the solution through a 0 45 μm membrane syringe filter and its concentration was measured using icp oes the sorption was also carried out at various ph levels 2 0 10 0 by changing the ph using 0 1 mol l hcl and naoh 1 0 g l of ggo gd2o3 was added in the 50 ml falcon tube and rotated the solution of each metal ion was adjusted in 10 mg l and the ion strength was matched with nacl in 0 01 m the mass balance between the initial c o and equilibrium c e concentrations mg l of the metal ions was used to compute the quantity of cr iii pb ii and as v adsorbed the ggo gd2o3 s metal uptake capacity q e mg g and percentage removal were determined using the following equations 1 q e mg g c o c e v m 2 r e m o v a l c o c e c o 100 where v l denotes the total volume of the adsorbate solution and m g denotes the adsorbent s weight all experiments were repeated to avoid experimental errors the given values are the average of three replicates the kinetic and equilibrium models were fitted using linear regression analysis in origin 8 0 3 results and discussions 3 1 optimization of the sa cmc ratio under continual stirring various quantities of sa and cmc were added to the appropriate solution the conditions are listed in detail in table 1 each mixture contained 1 w w of go gd2o3 and was mixed to homogeneity the bet surface areas and corresponding removal percentages show the parameters for efficient granulation and substantial adsorptive removal of heavy metals the percentage removal was highest when the mass ratio between sa and cmc was 1 1 furthermore when the cmc concentration was increased while keeping the sa concentration in the mixture constant the particles will become fragile due to cmc s low strength as both polymer ratios increased beyond 1 1 to 1 2 the adsorbent disintegrated and dispersed in the solution the properties and cation removal percentages of the granules formed under each set of conditions are listed in table 1 the total polymer concentration which is the sum of the sa and cmc concentrations was changed in a 1 1 ratio from 0 5 w w to 1 0 w w to 2 0 w w total polymer concentrations exceeding 3 w w may prevent powdered go gd2o3 pgo gd2o3 from being activated and decrease the bet surface area the polymer concentration should be low to prevent these issues and facilitate adsorptive removal as the polymer concentration increased the percentage removals of cr iii and as v reduced somewhat however at the total polymer concentrations of 0 5 and 1 0 the particle disintegrated and dissolved in conclusion the granules formed at a total polymer concentration of 2 in a 1 1 ratio are suitable for substantial adsorption operations 3 2 characterization the sem images of the granules are shown in fig 2 the average diameter of the granules was approximately 2 mm the magnified image revealed the surface roughness which increased the specific surface area the eds element maps for ggo gd2o3 are shown in fig s1 oxygen and carbon were the primary components on the surface comprising elemental fractions of 64 61 and 19 40 respectively calcium and gadolinium comprised 11 42 and 4 56 by atom respectively whereas sodium was not detected compare to go gd2o3 the percentage of gadolinium in ggo gd2o3 was lower 28 33 further the percentage of elemental composition was confirmed from fe sem fig s2 this result indicates combining sa and cmc both of which are typically composed of carbon with calcium chloride which acts as a cross linking agent reduced gadolinium concentration and activated oxygen functional groups to a greater extent than found in go gd2o3 alone the chemical compositions of ggo gd2o3 were investigated using xps and the spectra recorded are shown in fig 3 a peaks attributed to gd 3d and gd 4d appeared at 1197 34 and 153 15 ev respectively the binding energy intensities agree with c1s and o1s attributed in ggo gd2o3 fig 3 b c depicts the deconvolution xps for c1s and o1s the peak attributed to the co bond in the c1s spectrum proves that the bonds are similar to o c o which appears in duplicate at 288 09 ev 44 this finding shows the lack of the co bond and the gdo functional binding was represented at 531 27 ev 45 the ft ir spectra fig 3 d show a shift in the surface functional groups and the ggo gd2o3 chemical bonds as cr iii pb ii and as v were removed the band at 490 cm 1 was ascribed to the resonance of the gdo bond of gd2o3 in ggo gd2o3 46 47 the wide peak 3442 cm 1 detected can be related to the intermolecular oh symmetric stretching of the carboxyl of go or the polymers that bind the granules or adsorbed h2o on the surface of ggo gd2o3 the vibrations of the cc bond from the polymer and go structure were ascribed to the intense band at 1589 cm 1 fig s3 in addition peaks attributable to ch bending and oh bending of the carboxylic acid group were observed in the spectrum of ggo gd2o3 at 1427 and 1333 cm 1 respectively the ft ir spectra indicated that the produced ggo gd2o3surface had a significant number of oxygen containing functional groups which may operate as accessible adsorption sites assisting in the removal of heavy metal ions the crystalline structure of ggo gd2o3 can be deduced from the xrd analysis seen in fig 3 e according to jcpds 43 1015 the peaks appeared at 2θ 28 0 and 32 6 reflect the 222 and 4 0 0 crystalline planes of gd2o3 respectively indicating that the produced ggo gd2o3 contains cubic gd2o3 nanoparticles the diffract line at 10 corresponds to the 002 plane implying that the quantity of go on the surface of ggo gd2o3 was lower nevertheless noise may be indicative of go existence the patterns for ggo gd2o3 and pgo gd2o3 appear to be similar concerning the peaks attributable to gadolinium however the diffraction peaks at 77 are identical to the peaks exhibited by sa beads whereas peaks attributable to cmc beads are observed at 64 as seen in the pattern of ggo gd2o3 the resultant xrd pattern confirm the crystalline nature of the prepared material bet surface analysis table s1 indicated the surface area mean pore volume and pore diameter of the as prepared ggo gd2o3 to be 2 757 m2 g 0 015 cm3 g and 21 61 nm respectively ggo gd2o3 had a larger bet surface area than sa beads and sa cmc composite granules this finding suggests that the as prepared ggo gd2o3 has a mesoporous surface furthermore the difference between the bet surface areas of the sa cmc granules and ggo gd2o3 indicates that adding a non polymeric substance increases the surface area and compares the surface area of the sa beads to that of ggo gd2o3 indicates that adding cmc increases the activated surface area as a result ggo gd2o3 has a higher adsorptive potency and is simpler to separate than the powder go gd2o3 or sa cmc composite or the sa beads 3 3 effect of ph and dosage on adsorption to assess the influence of ph on the adsorption efficacy of ggo gd2o3 for heavy metals the sorption was tested in the ph range of 2 0 to 10 0 with the expected findings shown in fig 4 a in the displayed result as v and pb ii are removed more than 90 in the ph 3 0 and cr iii is removed in ph 4 0 the competitive interaction between surface h and the pollutants leads to a lower percentage of removal for cr iii and pb ii in contrast as v exist as neutral species lower ph shows lower adsorption on the pronated surface of adsorbent at lower ph however when the ph of the solution rises the adsorbent surface deprotonates allowing for additional adsorption sites for the target contaminants pb ii and cr iii when the solution ph rose above 4 0 the electrostatic interaction of arsenic anions seen in fig 4 e with a deprotonated adsorbent surface reduced adsorptive removal of as v refer to the ionic species data defined by visual minteq 3 1 fig 4 c e heavy metals such as cr iii and pb ii are converted as hydroxides in the aqueous condition and precipitate by creating the particles such as pb oh 2 s and cr oh 3 s depending on the species data ph more than 7 0 cannot be concluded as the adsorption removal therefore the suitable ph for the heavy metal adsorption onto the ggo gd2o3 is optimized as ph 4 0 the optimum amount of adsorbent dosage is determined by using various adsorbent dosages at optimum conditions it is predicted that increasing adsorbent dose will increase removal as the number of adsorption sites increases as shown in fig 4 b the increase of the percentage adsorptive removal reached 90 at the 1 0 g l for all metal ions in further experiments the dose of 1 4 g l of ggo gd2o3 was used where a percentage elimination of all metal ions achieved more than 95 3 4 effect of ionic strength and associate ions on the adsorption in aquatic settings heavy metals are not the only ions present wide ranges of chemicals pollute water and aggressively react with the material or heavy metals the interaction between the cationic and anionic species in the adsorption studies is described in fig 4 f h except for the addition of po4 3 at a 0 05 mol l cr iii is steadily removed at or over 90 under all other circumstances investigated this finding demonstrates that the cr iii removal by ggo gd2o3 is unaffected by any ionic species other than po4 3 due to inner sphere surface complexation at the interface of the adsorbent and metal 32 in pb ii the percentage removal decreased dramatically as the concentration of ca2 was increased furthermore at higher concentrations 0 3 m of k and mg2 reduced the removal of pb ii somewhat more than other ions because of the closeness in ionic strength and charge the ca2 k and mg2 ions may attenuate the interaction between the pb ii ion and the surface of the ggo gd2o3 in contrast the adsorption of as v was significantly influenced by anionic species co3 2 and po4 3 when co3 2 and po4 3 were added to the samples the percentage removal decreased until it reached 0 this may be the similarity of co3 2 and po4 3 with anionic arsenic species leads to competitive interactions between anionic species and as v for adsorption sites via inner sphere surface complexation 48 each metal has the potential to interact with other contaminants the effect of cr iii pb ii and as v on each other metal adsorption is depicted in fig s4 the fig s4 depicts the change in the removal of each metal ion as the concentrations of the metal ions cr iii pb ii and as v the percentage removal of as v fig s4 a c surpassed 60 throughout the range of metal ion concentration 0 20 mg l the most influential metal ion was cr iii in the removal of as v the adsorptive removal of as v was significantly decreased at a cr iii concentration of 10 mg l in contrast as seen in fig s4 d f which depicts the removal of cr iii the concentration of as v did not affect the percentage removal of cr iii this result indicates that cr iii is adsorbed preferentially over as v when these metal ions coexist during a single adsorption run the adsorptive removal of cr iii may proceed more rapidly than that of as v in the case of pb ii fig s4 g i the percentage removal appears to agree with the results of the pgo gd2o3 multiple ion adsorption studies for the same reason outlined above the precipitation needs to be considerably causing the reaction between pb ii and as v 49 in conclusion these batch experiments demonstrate the adsorptive removal of cr iii pb ii and as v can proceed satisfactorily even at elevated ion concentrations 3 5 effect of contact time and adsorption kinetics the pseudo first order pfo model the pseudo second order pso model and the elovich equation all of which are detailed in the supplementary information were utilized in these kinetics investigations fig 5 a c shows the results of fitting kinetic models for the kinetic data of cr iii pb ii and as v respectively table s2 lists the anticipated kinetic parameters cr iii pb ii and as v adsorption kinetics obeyed the pso model equation more closely than the others as shown in table s2 the pso model predicted qe values of 6 520 9 168 and 6 912 mg g for cr iii pb ii and as v respectively which were consistent with the experimental qe data 6 371 5 864 and 6 499 mg g for cr iii pb ii and as v respectively furthermore the correlation coefficient associated with the pso fit was the closest to 1 these findings showed that all metal ion adsorption kinetics were rate limiting diffusion kinetics further the equilibrium durations for cr iii pb ii and as v adsorptive removals were determined to be 600 180 and 1080 min respectively 3 6 adsorption isotherms and metal ion concentrations the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich model equations were fitted to the isotherm data of all metal ions to identify the adsorption processes and the resulting isotherms are shown in fig s5 the anticipated isotherm parameters are shown in table 2 the supporting information contains the theoretical details the adsorption of the metal ions using ggo gd2o3 followed the langmuir model equation most closely as evidenced by the consistently high value of its correlation coefficient that closes to one as a result heavy metal removal using ggo gd2o3 is believed to proceed by monolayer adsorption additionally at 298 k the maximal adsorption capacity of ggo gd2o3 for cr iii pb ii and as v was determined to be 29 155 158 73 and 36 765 mg g respectively notably binding the material using polymers increases the capacity for adsorbing metal cations while decreasing the capacity for adsorbing metal anions in other words the abilities for adsorbing cr iii and as v increase whereas that for pb ii decreases spontaneously furthermore cr iii and as v adsorption abilities were proportional to temperature and comparable to the maximal adsorption capacity of go gd2o3 powder pgo gd2o3 however the removal of pb ii had the opposite effect as that of cr iii and as v table 3 compares the maximal adsorption capacities obtained in this study to those observed in other studies using similar particle and granular materials the adsorption capacities of ggo gd2o3 for cr iii pb ii and as v indicate the reliability and feasibility of this material for the adsorptive removal of these ions from contaminated water 3 7 thermodynamic theory table 4 displays the predicted thermodynamic parameters based on a linear plot of gibbs free energy vs process temperature fig s6 for cr iii and as v adsorptions the gibbs free energy of adsorption dropped as the temperature increased in contrast the gibbs free energy for removal of pb ii increased although it was not positive changes in adsorption enthalpy are positive for cr iii and as v but negative for pb ii this implies that cr iii and as v adsorptions are endothermic whereas pb ii adsorption is exothermic the enthalpy changes for single component adsorption of cr iii pb ii and as v were determined to be 40 812 68 797 and 47 362 kj mol respectively this finding suggests that the adsorptions of cr iii and as v are engaged in both physical and chemical interactions on the adsorbent surface 67 furthermore the enthalpy change for pb ii adsorption was less than 40 kj mol which is characteristic of physisorption 68 an increase in entropy was calculated for the adsorption of cr iii and as v at the solid solution interface the high affinities of the metal ions for ggo gd2o3 were confirmed 3 8 adsorption mechanism fig 3 d and fig 6 illustrate the ft ir and xps spectra respectively and show the interactions between metal ions and ggo gd2o3 as seen in the ft ir spectral analyses the peaks attributed to the oh functional groups decreased in intensity and shifted compared to the pristine material following the single component adsorptive removal of cr iii pb ii and as v the peak ascribed to the carboxylic function s oh bond moved to 1322 1328 and 1322 cm 1 respectively furthermore the peak attributed to gdo present on the surface of the ggo gd2o3 shifted by different extents the maxima lines at 498 and 820 cm 1 were ascribed to the presence of gd o cr and cro on the surface of the ggo gd2o3 upon cr iii adsorption peaks detected pb ii at 455 and 683 cm 1 which were ascribed to the pbo and o pb o bonds respectively peaks at 471 and 795 cm 1 indicated the existence of as v which were ascribed to aso and gd o as respectively the bonding is inferred to be inner sphere complexation wherein the metallic atom reacts with the ligand in this form of bonding the arsenic anion reacts directly with gadolinium as a result of interacting with oxygen containing functions the cr iii pb ii and as v ions are adsorbed onto the surface of ggo gd2o3 further the mechanism was clearly explained by the xps of ggo gd2o3 after the adsorption of metal ions fig 6 after metal adsorption new peaks appear on the spectra as shown in fig 6 a these patterns show that the heavy metals are efficiently adsorbed onto the adsorbent s surface small shifts in bonding energies of peaks were also detected the convolutional c1s xps data fig 6 b exhibited three sub peaks attributed to cc o c o and co at 284 81 288 09 and 286 40 ev respectively these peaks shifted to 284 43 288 22 and 286 11 ev respectively following cr iii adsorption following pb ii adsorption the same peaks moved to 284 51 286 22 and 288 20 ev respectively finally following the as v adsorption the peaks moved to 284 81 286 43 and 287 91 ev respectively the observed change in the shape of the c1s xps spectra was small suggesting that the main c skeleton structure was persistent the convolutional o1s parameters fig 6 c can be determined from the three peaks indicating to co co and gd o however the co peak doesn t appear in any of the spectra therefore the peak shift was defined using co and gdo shifts in the xps spectrum of pure ggo gd2o3 the o1s spectral peaks were located at 532 82 and 531 27 ev indicating the presence of co and gdo respectively following single component sequestration of cr iii pb ii and as v the co peaks shifted to 532 52 532 89 and 532 75 ev respectively additionally after loading of cr iii pb ii and as v on gdo the peaks shifted to 530 89 530 88 and 531 00 ev respectively the change observed in the shape of the o1s xps spectra following the removal of as v indicated that gd is the main reactant for as v in conclusion these fractional shifts and binding energy changes suggest that the oxygen containing functional groups are preferably involved in the adsorption of metal ions via surface complexation or ion exchange mechanism further the solution ph effect and phzpc of the adsorbent experiments clearly illustrate the adsorption mechanism the zero point charge ph phzpc of the ggo gd2o3 was calculated to be 7 19 by titration method the pka1 s and pka2 s were estimated to be 5 68 and 8 70 respectively the ph of the solutions before and after adsorption of metal is plotted in fig s7 in the lower ph range around 2 0 3 0 the ph of solution was increased by the adsorption of cr iii and pb ii along with extended change of surface charge of adsorbent with increasing ph as v underwent a smaller change than cr iii and pb ii did the activities of ggo gd2o3 and each metal ion may affect the surface charge of ggo gd2o3 when the ph increased beyond 8 0 the adsorbent surface charge becoming negative through functionalized oh ions furthermore the highest adsorption capacity was discovered even at ph 4 0 phzpc 7 19 this finding suggests that the adsorption process was mostly caused by surface complexation rather than electrostatic contact 29 the schematic plausible adsorption mechanism of heavy metal on ggo gd2o3 shown in fig 7 3 9 recycle ability of ggo gd2o3 in terms of economics the long term use of an adsorbent with higher performance is a critical criterion as a result the recycle ability of ggo gd2o3 was investigated further the ggo gd2o3 dosage was 1 4 g l the target metal ion concentrations were 10 mg l and the ph was 4 accordingly cr iii and pb ii ions were desorbed with edta 0 1 mol l after adsorption whereas as v was desorbed with naoh 0 2 mol l following that the solution was washed with deionized water until it was neutral to preparation for the next cycle circulation features of detection results show in fig s8 the adsorbent used up to five times in this investigation the adsorption capacity of all metal ions solution decreased somewhat as number of reuse cycles increased the metal ion adsorption reduced which might indicate that a few adsorption sites did not entirely desorb of the metal ions during desorption process on the other side it might be attributed to mass loss during the adsorption and desorption processes although there is decrease of sorption removal after 4th cycle re use of adsorbent above 90 sorption removal for all metal ions was achieved up to 3 cycles it indicates that the adsorbent has pleasant mechanical characteristics and satisfies the criteria for sustainable development in general the adsorbent is a cost effective reusable adsorption material that efficiently removes cr iii pb ii and as v ions from effluent 3 10 column study the surface water collected from the haft of the nakdong mine at jeongseon gun gangwon do south korea was treated to adsorption with ggo gd2o3 the amount of as v in the tested surface water was 0 280 mg l which is almost 28 times higher than the drinking water regulations 10 μg l in this surface water contain 68 32 mg l of ca2 8 406 mg l of na 8 943 mg l of k 11 47 mg l of mg2 14 1 mg l of cl 43 4 mg l of so4 3 14 8 mg l of no3 172 mg l of hco3 and 0 104 mg l of total iron however cr iii and pb ii were not found in the real surface water 0 280 mg l of cr iii and pb ii spiked to this surface water the fixed bed column tests were carried out using with a constant flow rate of 5 ml min across the columns at ph 6 between two layers of glass wool the column was filled with adsorbent 0 2 g with 2 cm height in a 5 cm column a peristaltic pump was used to control the intake flow rate of synthetic wastewater which was collected in a bucket the bottom of the column was connected with rubber tubing and a flow adjustable clamp as a result the clamp was used to regulate the outflow rate the samples were taken at regular intervals and kept evaluating the metal ion content with icp oes the flowing of all metal ion solution across the bed was maintained until no further adsorption occurred all of the studies were done at room temperature the slow absorption of metal ions in the early phases subsequently increased rates and ultimately attained saturation at 6000 bed volume for all metals can be seen in fig 8 for the same starting cr iii pb ii and as v concentration 0 280 mg l the equilibrium adsorption capabilities of the ggo gd2o3 in column and batch experiments are similar moreover the effluent concentration was suppressed under epa standards for all metal ions around 1500 bed volume this result suggest that the developed material can be potential used for real water system treatment 4 conclusions granules go gd2o3 were successfully synthesized using appropriate concentrations of sa and cmc the sem tem and bet results found that ggo gd2o3 is a spherical granular adsorbent with an average diameter of 2 mm and a bet surface area of 2 757 m2 g outperforming other granular materials further xrd xps and ft ir results confirmed the adsorbent surface functional groups such as oh co o c o and cooh in addition to gd2o3 which are promote metal adsorptive removal the optimal values of ph ggo gd2o3 dosage and time of adsorption were ascertained from the results of the batch experiments to be 4 0 1 4 g l and 1080 min respectively single contaminant samples for all metal ions examined the adsorption kinetics and isotherm findings indicated that adsorption was a rate limiting monolayer on the uniform surface of the adsorbent thermodynamic studies showed that cr iii and as v adsorb physicochemical whereas pb ii physiosorbed the maximum adsorption capacities of ggo gd2o3 for cr iii pb ii and as v were 29 16 158 23 and 36 77 mg g respectively these values were comparable to those achieved by similar granular adsorbents reported in contemporary works the xps spectra analysis and batch investigations results concluded that heavy metal ion adsorptive removal carried out mostly by surface complexation and ion exchange rather than electrostatic contact this study s findings on the sorption characteristics of batch and column systems could be used to develop a sorption system for heavy metal ion polluted wastewater treatment data availability the raw processed data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time as the data also forms part of an ongoing study declaration of competing interest none acknowledgment this study was funded in part by the

strongly with anionic species such as arsenic the incorporation of gadolinium oxide to go facilitates the removal of anion and cation heavy metals however the product was practically infeasible because to the thin friable and light flakes to address these flaws a polymer combination sodium alginate sa and carboxymethyl cellulose cmc was employed to bind go gd2o3 into granules the ability of which was verified to adsorb cr iii pb ii and as v the effective operating ph dose and temperature were 4 0 1 4 g l and 298 k respectively cr iii pb ii and as v all had adsorption capabilities of 29 16 158 73 and 36 77 mg g demonstrating ggo gd2o3 as effective granules for heavy metals removal from complex aquatic environments according to the thermodynamic data cr iii and as v adsorptions are endothermic but pb ii adsorption is exothermic the probable sorption mechanism was thoroughly discussed the viability of produced materials was assessed by investigating their re usability and use in real surface water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords alginate cmc composite graphene oxide gadolinium oxide heavy metal treatment granular adsorbent 1 introduction heavy metals released into the environment by different manufacturing companies as well as natural contamination are major causes of water pollution across the world 1 heavy metals in surface and groundwater sources have been designated as significant inorganic pollutants in the environment due to their motility in aquatic ecosystems biotransformation and toxicity to higher living forms 2 cr iii pb ii and as v are three major carcinogenic heavy metals that contribute to water contamination as a result of fast industrialization hard acids are formed when cr iii forms strong complexes with oxygen high levels of cr iii in water on the other hand may have severe ecological implications and even some harmful and malignant health effects on the human 3 7 pb ii is a well known toxic heavy metal that causes adverse effects to the human health for example red blood cells transport it to the liver and kidneys where it is subsequently redistributed as lead phosphate to the teeth bones and hair that poisoning can be acute or persistent 6 8 10 arsenic is poisonous to humans animals and plants it inactivates enzymes especially those involved in cellular energy metabolism and dna synthesis and repair 11 16 because of the ongoing global rise in hazardous pollutant exposure researchers are encouraged to discover efficient novel strategies for their removal adsorption is considered one of the most promising ways to eliminate hazardous metals from aqueous solutions because of its ease of use versatility and high efficiency in commercial applications compared to other approaches 17 18 owing their higher specific surface areas and number of active moieties nanomaterials have attracted a great attention and research interest several carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have been utilized to create activated carbon material that remove organic and inorganic contaminants from wastewater 19 graphene is a two dimensional structure composed of a thin layer of hexagon formed carbon its oxidized state known as graphene oxide go includes potent active sites such as hydroxyl carboxyl carbonyl and epoxy groups that interface with polarized contaminants heavy metals were effectively removed utilizing go as the adsorbent demonstrating its adsorption effectiveness 19 21 however extracting because of its great dispensability go recovery from aqueous solutions is challenging as a result researchers are encouraged to investigate alternative configured or hybridized go compounds for water purification to solve this issue moreover the surface modification go can enhances its application feasibility in various field 22 in recent times amino silanes 23 diethylenetriamine 24 mn doped tio2 25 fe3o4 26 27 nife2o4 6 15 28 30 gd2o3 28 31 33 polyvinyl alcohol gd2o3 34 and lanthanum 35 36 have been used to modify go surface in order to use for the removal various pollutants from this literature survey it is understood that the gd2o3 is doped go that enhance stability and adsorption ability for selective removal of pollutants in particularly gd3 exhibits a high selectivity for phosphorus silicon and arsenic like fe3 and al3 that are often used to the arsenic removal 37 this study prompt us to synthesis gd2o3 doped go in this study however go based materials are generated as a powder which is challenging to manage and utilize in practice granulation can help to overcome this constraint polymers such as cellulose chitosan and alginate can serve as excellent binders the interaction between graphene and the polymer causes the mass to aggregate into spherical hydrogel capsules 38 hydrogels are used to encapsulate the materials due to their aqueous interiors and porous structures 39 furthermore polymers act as binding materials and elicit the self assembly of graphene oxide 25 in this work alginate and carboxymethyl cellulose were selected as the polymers to aggregate the gadolinium doped graphene oxide into adsorbent granules sodium alginate sa is mainly made up of mannuronic and guluronic acids and it has a lot of free carboxyl groups 40 on the other hand sodium carboxymethyl cellulose cmc is an anionic high molecular molecule made from natural cellulose and caustic alkali in the presence of acetic acid 41 both polymers can exchange cations with a wide range of divalent and trivalent cations furthermore both polymers are biodegradable biocompatible bioactive easy to mold water soluble and organic solvent insoluble these biopolymers can interacts with go and give a 3d structure contain granular materials 42 that may prevent difficulties of powders in real field application in this work the biopolymers sa and cmc are used to form granules of a graphene oxide nanocomposite that is doped with gadolinium oxide gd2o3 in order avoid difficulty in recovery of powdered form of go materials after sustainable removal of heavy metals such as as v pb ii and cr iii the finalized granular biopolymer encapsulated gd2o3 doped go called as ggo gd2o3 batch and column experiments are performed to optimize the conditions for adsorptive removal of heavy metals also the developed material ggo gd2o3 applied for real surface water treatment and checked its re usability and stability in this study the overall study may suggest the potential applicability and ability to design of wastewater treatment system using ggo gd2o3 2 material and methods 2 1 materials graphite flakes and h2o2 were bought from sigma aldrich in the united states and samchun chemical in korea supplied the nano3 h2so4 kmno4 and gd no3 3 samchun chemical also provided the sodium alginate and carboxymethyl cellulose utilized to create the granular nanocomposite 2 2 preparation of ggo gd2o3 the scheme for the preparation of the material is provided in fig 1 go the core of this synthesis was produced by the hummers method 43 following a previously reported procedure the go gd2o3 nanocomposite was synthesized 33 one gram of as prepared go was distributed in 100 ml of distilled water the gd no3 3 solution was then added to the go solution in such a way that the go and gd3 ion ratio remained at 1 5 w w by homogenizing the mixture with a 5 m naoh solution the ph was adjusted to 10 the temperature was then increased to 353 k and maintained there for 1 h upon completing the thermal treatment the mixture was freeze dried in a freeze dryer fdb 7003 korea the resulting go gd2o3 nanocomposite was light enough to disperse in the water though insoluble the sol gel transition of a biopolymer combination including the go gd2o3 nanocomposite was used to make go gd2o3 granules sa and cmc were dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water by slow mixing to each biopolymer mixture 1 g of go gd2o3 was added and gently mixed using a continuous syringe pump these combinations were slowly added to a 0 5 m cacl2 solution the sol gel transition commenced after the mixture was added and spherical hydrogel particles were produced the granules were subsequently washed and dried using a freeze dryer 2 3 characterization the surface functional groups of ggo gd2o3 were identified by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi quantera ii ulvac phi kanagawa japan and fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrometry irspirit shimadzu corporation japan x ray diffraction xrd d max 2500 rigaku tokyo japan was used to investigate the ggo gd2o3 crystalline structure scanning electron microscopy sem combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds s 4300 with quantax eds bruker germany was used to investigate the surface morphology and elemental composition of the adsorbent the autosorb 1 surface area and pore size analyzer quantachrome instruments boynton beach fl usa was used to calculate the surface area pore volume and pore diameter of the as prepared materials the ultra sonication of go and the go gd2o3 nanocomposites was conducted using a sonics vibracell cv 334 usa inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes perkin elmer usa was used to monitor the concentrations of the metal ions a 340i ph meter was used to take all of the ph readings wtw germany 2 4 adsorption experiments cr no3 3 9h2o pb no3 2 and na2haso4 7h2o were used to make a known amount solution 1000 mg l of cr iii pb ii and as v for the batch test batch tests were conducted using specific amounts of metal solution 0 100 mg l and a constant amount of ggo gd2o3 which was optimized by experiments performed under predetermined conditions in 50 ml falcon tubes at fixed ph and different temperatures to investigate the time required to achieve equilibrium for each run following equilibration the metal was collected by filtering the solution through a 0 45 μm membrane syringe filter and its concentration was measured using icp oes the sorption was also carried out at various ph levels 2 0 10 0 by changing the ph using 0 1 mol l hcl and naoh 1 0 g l of ggo gd2o3 was added in the 50 ml falcon tube and rotated the solution of each metal ion was adjusted in 10 mg l and the ion strength was matched with nacl in 0 01 m the mass balance between the initial c o and equilibrium c e concentrations mg l of the metal ions was used to compute the quantity of cr iii pb ii and as v adsorbed the ggo gd2o3 s metal uptake capacity q e mg g and percentage removal were determined using the following equations 1 q e mg g c o c e v m 2 r e m o v a l c o c e c o 100 where v l denotes the total volume of the adsorbate solution and m g denotes the adsorbent s weight all experiments were repeated to avoid experimental errors the given values are the average of three replicates the kinetic and equilibrium models were fitted using linear regression analysis in origin 8 0 3 results and discussions 3 1 optimization of the sa cmc ratio under continual stirring various quantities of sa and cmc were added to the appropriate solution the conditions are listed in detail in table 1 each mixture contained 1 w w of go gd2o3 and was mixed to homogeneity the bet surface areas and corresponding removal percentages show the parameters for efficient granulation and substantial adsorptive removal of heavy metals the percentage removal was highest when the mass ratio between sa and cmc was 1 1 furthermore when the cmc concentration was increased while keeping the sa concentration in the mixture constant the particles will become fragile due to cmc s low strength as both polymer ratios increased beyond 1 1 to 1 2 the adsorbent disintegrated and dispersed in the solution the properties and cation removal percentages of the granules formed under each set of conditions are listed in table 1 the total polymer concentration which is the sum of the sa and cmc concentrations was changed in a 1 1 ratio from 0 5 w w to 1 0 w w to 2 0 w w total polymer concentrations exceeding 3 w w may prevent powdered go gd2o3 pgo gd2o3 from being activated and decrease the bet surface area the polymer concentration should be low to prevent these issues and facilitate adsorptive removal as the polymer concentration increased the percentage removals of cr iii and as v reduced somewhat however at the total polymer concentrations of 0 5 and 1 0 the particle disintegrated and dissolved in conclusion the granules formed at a total polymer concentration of 2 in a 1 1 ratio are suitable for substantial adsorption operations 3 2 characterization the sem images of the granules are shown in fig 2 the average diameter of the granules was approximately 2 mm the magnified image revealed the surface roughness which increased the specific surface area the eds element maps for ggo gd2o3 are shown in fig s1 oxygen and carbon were the primary components on the surface comprising elemental fractions of 64 61 and 19 40 respectively calcium and gadolinium comprised 11 42 and 4 56 by atom respectively whereas sodium was not detected compare to go gd2o3 the percentage of gadolinium in ggo gd2o3 was lower 28 33 further the percentage of elemental composition was confirmed from fe sem fig s2 this result indicates combining sa and cmc both of which are typically composed of carbon with calcium chloride which acts as a cross linking agent reduced gadolinium concentration and activated oxygen functional groups to a greater extent than found in go gd2o3 alone the chemical compositions of ggo gd2o3 were investigated using xps and the spectra recorded are shown in fig 3 a peaks attributed to gd 3d and gd 4d appeared at 1197 34 and 153 15 ev respectively the binding energy intensities agree with c1s and o1s attributed in ggo gd2o3 fig 3 b c depicts the deconvolution xps for c1s and o1s the peak attributed to the co bond in the c1s spectrum proves that the bonds are similar to o c o which appears in duplicate at 288 09 ev 44 this finding shows the lack of the co bond and the gdo functional binding was represented at 531 27 ev 45 the ft ir spectra fig 3 d show a shift in the surface functional groups and the ggo gd2o3 chemical bonds as cr iii pb ii and as v were removed the band at 490 cm 1 was ascribed to the resonance of the gdo bond of gd2o3 in ggo gd2o3 46 47 the wide peak 3442 cm 1 detected can be related to the intermolecular oh symmetric stretching of the carboxyl of go or the polymers that bind the granules or adsorbed h2o on the surface of ggo gd2o3 the vibrations of the cc bond from the polymer and go structure were ascribed to the intense band at 1589 cm 1 fig s3 in addition peaks attributable to ch bending and oh bending of the carboxylic acid group were observed in the spectrum of ggo gd2o3 at 1427 and 1333 cm 1 respectively the ft ir spectra indicated that the produced ggo gd2o3surface had a significant number of oxygen containing functional groups which may operate as accessible adsorption sites assisting in the removal of heavy metal ions the crystalline structure of ggo gd2o3 can be deduced from the xrd analysis seen in fig 3 e according to jcpds 43 1015 the peaks appeared at 2θ 28 0 and 32 6 reflect the 222 and 4 0 0 crystalline planes of gd2o3 respectively indicating that the produced ggo gd2o3 contains cubic gd2o3 nanoparticles the diffract line at 10 corresponds to the 002 plane implying that the quantity of go on the surface of ggo gd2o3 was lower nevertheless noise may be indicative of go existence the patterns for ggo gd2o3 and pgo gd2o3 appear to be similar concerning the peaks attributable to gadolinium however the diffraction peaks at 77 are identical to the peaks exhibited by sa beads whereas peaks attributable to cmc beads are observed at 64 as seen in the pattern of ggo gd2o3 the resultant xrd pattern confirm the crystalline nature of the prepared material bet surface analysis table s1 indicated the surface area mean pore volume and pore diameter of the as prepared ggo gd2o3 to be 2 757 m2 g 0 015 cm3 g and 21 61 nm respectively ggo gd2o3 had a larger bet surface area than sa beads and sa cmc composite granules this finding suggests that the as prepared ggo gd2o3 has a mesoporous surface furthermore the difference between the bet surface areas of the sa cmc granules and ggo gd2o3 indicates that adding a non polymeric substance increases the surface area and compares the surface area of the sa beads to that of ggo gd2o3 indicates that adding cmc increases the activated surface area as a result ggo gd2o3 has a higher adsorptive potency and is simpler to separate than the powder go gd2o3 or sa cmc composite or the sa beads 3 3 effect of ph and dosage on adsorption to assess the influence of ph on the adsorption efficacy of ggo gd2o3 for heavy metals the sorption was tested in the ph range of 2 0 to 10 0 with the expected findings shown in fig 4 a in the displayed result as v and pb ii are removed more than 90 in the ph 3 0 and cr iii is removed in ph 4 0 the competitive interaction between surface h and the pollutants leads to a lower percentage of removal for cr iii and pb ii in contrast as v exist as neutral species lower ph shows lower adsorption on the pronated surface of adsorbent at lower ph however when the ph of the solution rises the adsorbent surface deprotonates allowing for additional adsorption sites for the target contaminants pb ii and cr iii when the solution ph rose above 4 0 the electrostatic interaction of arsenic anions seen in fig 4 e with a deprotonated adsorbent surface reduced adsorptive removal of as v refer to the ionic species data defined by visual minteq 3 1 fig 4 c e heavy metals such as cr iii and pb ii are converted as hydroxides in the aqueous condition and precipitate by creating the particles such as pb oh 2 s and cr oh 3 s depending on the species data ph more than 7 0 cannot be concluded as the adsorption removal therefore the suitable ph for the heavy metal adsorption onto the ggo gd2o3 is optimized as ph 4 0 the optimum amount of adsorbent dosage is determined by using various adsorbent dosages at optimum conditions it is predicted that increasing adsorbent dose will increase removal as the number of adsorption sites increases as shown in fig 4 b the increase of the percentage adsorptive removal reached 90 at the 1 0 g l for all metal ions in further experiments the dose of 1 4 g l of ggo gd2o3 was used where a percentage elimination of all metal ions achieved more than 95 3 4 effect of ionic strength and associate ions on the adsorption in aquatic settings heavy metals are not the only ions present wide ranges of chemicals pollute water and aggressively react with the material or heavy metals the interaction between the cationic and anionic species in the adsorption studies is described in fig 4 f h except for the addition of po4 3 at a 0 05 mol l cr iii is steadily removed at or over 90 under all other circumstances investigated this finding demonstrates that the cr iii removal by ggo gd2o3 is unaffected by any ionic species other than po4 3 due to inner sphere surface complexation at the interface of the adsorbent and metal 32 in pb ii the percentage removal decreased dramatically as the concentration of ca2 was increased furthermore at higher concentrations 0 3 m of k and mg2 reduced the removal of pb ii somewhat more than other ions because of the closeness in ionic strength and charge the ca2 k and mg2 ions may attenuate the interaction between the pb ii ion and the surface of the ggo gd2o3 in contrast the adsorption of as v was significantly influenced by anionic species co3 2 and po4 3 when co3 2 and po4 3 were added to the samples the percentage removal decreased until it reached 0 this may be the similarity of co3 2 and po4 3 with anionic arsenic species leads to competitive interactions between anionic species and as v for adsorption sites via inner sphere surface complexation 48 each metal has the potential to interact with other contaminants the effect of cr iii pb ii and as v on each other metal adsorption is depicted in fig s4 the fig s4 depicts the change in the removal of each metal ion as the concentrations of the metal ions cr iii pb ii and as v the percentage removal of as v fig s4 a c surpassed 60 throughout the range of metal ion concentration 0 20 mg l the most influential metal ion was cr iii in the removal of as v the adsorptive removal of as v was significantly decreased at a cr iii concentration of 10 mg l in contrast as seen in fig s4 d f which depicts the removal of cr iii the concentration of as v did not affect the percentage removal of cr iii this result indicates that cr iii is adsorbed preferentially over as v when these metal ions coexist during a single adsorption run the adsorptive removal of cr iii may proceed more rapidly than that of as v in the case of pb ii fig s4 g i the percentage removal appears to agree with the results of the pgo gd2o3 multiple ion adsorption studies for the same reason outlined above the precipitation needs to be considerably causing the reaction between pb ii and as v 49 in conclusion these batch experiments demonstrate the adsorptive removal of cr iii pb ii and as v can proceed satisfactorily even at elevated ion concentrations 3 5 effect of contact time and adsorption kinetics the pseudo first order pfo model the pseudo second order pso model and the elovich equation all of which are detailed in the supplementary information were utilized in these kinetics investigations fig 5 a c shows the results of fitting kinetic models for the kinetic data of cr iii pb ii and as v respectively table s2 lists the anticipated kinetic parameters cr iii pb ii and as v adsorption kinetics obeyed the pso model equation more closely than the others as shown in table s2 the pso model predicted qe values of 6 520 9 168 and 6 912 mg g for cr iii pb ii and as v respectively which were consistent with the experimental qe data 6 371 5 864 and 6 499 mg g for cr iii pb ii and as v respectively furthermore the correlation coefficient associated with the pso fit was the closest to 1 these findings showed that all metal ion adsorption kinetics were rate limiting diffusion kinetics further the equilibrium durations for cr iii pb ii and as v adsorptive removals were determined to be 600 180 and 1080 min respectively 3 6 adsorption isotherms and metal ion concentrations the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich model equations were fitted to the isotherm data of all metal ions to identify the adsorption processes and the resulting isotherms are shown in fig s5 the anticipated isotherm parameters are shown in table 2 the supporting information contains the theoretical details the adsorption of the metal ions using ggo gd2o3 followed the langmuir model equation most closely as evidenced by the consistently high value of its correlation coefficient that closes to one as a result heavy metal removal using ggo gd2o3 is believed to proceed by monolayer adsorption additionally at 298 k the maximal adsorption capacity of ggo gd2o3 for cr iii pb ii and as v was determined to be 29 155 158 73 and 36 765 mg g respectively notably binding the material using polymers increases the capacity for adsorbing metal cations while decreasing the capacity for adsorbing metal anions in other words the abilities for adsorbing cr iii and as v increase whereas that for pb ii decreases spontaneously furthermore cr iii and as v adsorption abilities were proportional to temperature and comparable to the maximal adsorption capacity of go gd2o3 powder pgo gd2o3 however the removal of pb ii had the opposite effect as that of cr iii and as v table 3 compares the maximal adsorption capacities obtained in this study to those observed in other studies using similar particle and granular materials the adsorption capacities of ggo gd2o3 for cr iii pb ii and as v indicate the reliability and feasibility of this material for the adsorptive removal of these ions from contaminated water 3 7 thermodynamic theory table 4 displays the predicted thermodynamic parameters based on a linear plot of gibbs free energy vs process temperature fig s6 for cr iii and as v adsorptions the gibbs free energy of adsorption dropped as the temperature increased in contrast the gibbs free energy for removal of pb ii increased although it was not positive changes in adsorption enthalpy are positive for cr iii and as v but negative for pb ii this implies that cr iii and as v adsorptions are endothermic whereas pb ii adsorption is exothermic the enthalpy changes for single component adsorption of cr iii pb ii and as v were determined to be 40 812 68 797 and 47 362 kj mol respectively this finding suggests that the adsorptions of cr iii and as v are engaged in both physical and chemical interactions on the adsorbent surface 67 furthermore the enthalpy change for pb ii adsorption was less than 40 kj mol which is characteristic of physisorption 68 an increase in entropy was calculated for the adsorption of cr iii and as v at the solid solution interface the high affinities of the metal ions for ggo gd2o3 were confirmed 3 8 adsorption mechanism fig 3 d and fig 6 illustrate the ft ir and xps spectra respectively and show the interactions between metal ions and ggo gd2o3 as seen in the ft ir spectral analyses the peaks attributed to the oh functional groups decreased in intensity and shifted compared to the pristine material following the single component adsorptive removal of cr iii pb ii and as v the peak ascribed to the carboxylic function s oh bond moved to 1322 1328 and 1322 cm 1 respectively furthermore the peak attributed to gdo present on the surface of the ggo gd2o3 shifted by different extents the maxima lines at 498 and 820 cm 1 were ascribed to the presence of gd o cr and cro on the surface of the ggo gd2o3 upon cr iii adsorption peaks detected pb ii at 455 and 683 cm 1 which were ascribed to the pbo and o pb o bonds respectively peaks at 471 and 795 cm 1 indicated the existence of as v which were ascribed to aso and gd o as respectively the bonding is inferred to be inner sphere complexation wherein the metallic atom reacts with the ligand in this form of bonding the arsenic anion reacts directly with gadolinium as a result of interacting with oxygen containing functions the cr iii pb ii and as v ions are adsorbed onto the surface of ggo gd2o3 further the mechanism was clearly explained by the xps of ggo gd2o3 after the adsorption of metal ions fig 6 after metal adsorption new peaks appear on the spectra as shown in fig 6 a these patterns show that the heavy metals are efficiently adsorbed onto the adsorbent s surface small shifts in bonding energies of peaks were also detected the convolutional c1s xps data fig 6 b exhibited three sub peaks attributed to cc o c o and co at 284 81 288 09 and 286 40 ev respectively these peaks shifted to 284 43 288 22 and 286 11 ev respectively following cr iii adsorption following pb ii adsorption the same peaks moved to 284 51 286 22 and 288 20 ev respectively finally following the as v adsorption the peaks moved to 284 81 286 43 and 287 91 ev respectively the observed change in the shape of the c1s xps spectra was small suggesting that the main c skeleton structure was persistent the convolutional o1s parameters fig 6 c can be determined from the three peaks indicating to co co and gd o however the co peak doesn t appear in any of the spectra therefore the peak shift was defined using co and gdo shifts in the xps spectrum of pure ggo gd2o3 the o1s spectral peaks were located at 532 82 and 531 27 ev indicating the presence of co and gdo respectively following single component sequestration of cr iii pb ii and as v the co peaks shifted to 532 52 532 89 and 532 75 ev respectively additionally after loading of cr iii pb ii and as v on gdo the peaks shifted to 530 89 530 88 and 531 00 ev respectively the change observed in the shape of the o1s xps spectra following the removal of as v indicated that gd is the main reactant for as v in conclusion these fractional shifts and binding energy changes suggest that the oxygen containing functional groups are preferably involved in the adsorption of metal ions via surface complexation or ion exchange mechanism further the solution ph effect and phzpc of the adsorbent experiments clearly illustrate the adsorption mechanism the zero point charge ph phzpc of the ggo gd2o3 was calculated to be 7 19 by titration method the pka1 s and pka2 s were estimated to be 5 68 and 8 70 respectively the ph of the solutions before and after adsorption of metal is plotted in fig s7 in the lower ph range around 2 0 3 0 the ph of solution was increased by the adsorption of cr iii and pb ii along with extended change of surface charge of adsorbent with increasing ph as v underwent a smaller change than cr iii and pb ii did the activities of ggo gd2o3 and each metal ion may affect the surface charge of ggo gd2o3 when the ph increased beyond 8 0 the adsorbent surface charge becoming negative through functionalized oh ions furthermore the highest adsorption capacity was discovered even at ph 4 0 phzpc 7 19 this finding suggests that the adsorption process was mostly caused by surface complexation rather than electrostatic contact 29 the schematic plausible adsorption mechanism of heavy metal on ggo gd2o3 shown in fig 7 3 9 recycle ability of ggo gd2o3 in terms of economics the long term use of an adsorbent with higher performance is a critical criterion as a result the recycle ability of ggo gd2o3 was investigated further the ggo gd2o3 dosage was 1 4 g l the target metal ion concentrations were 10 mg l and the ph was 4 accordingly cr iii and pb ii ions were desorbed with edta 0 1 mol l after adsorption whereas as v was desorbed with naoh 0 2 mol l following that the solution was washed with deionized water until it was neutral to preparation for the next cycle circulation features of detection results show in fig s8 the adsorbent used up to five times in this investigation the adsorption capacity of all metal ions solution decreased somewhat as number of reuse cycles increased the metal ion adsorption reduced which might indicate that a few adsorption sites did not entirely desorb of the metal ions during desorption process on the other side it might be attributed to mass loss during the adsorption and desorption processes although there is decrease of sorption removal after 4th cycle re use of adsorbent above 90 sorption removal for all metal ions was achieved up to 3 cycles it indicates that the adsorbent has pleasant mechanical characteristics and satisfies the criteria for sustainable development in general the adsorbent is a cost effective reusable adsorption material that efficiently removes cr iii pb ii and as v ions from effluent 3 10 column study the surface water collected from the haft of the nakdong mine at jeongseon gun gangwon do south korea was treated to adsorption with ggo gd2o3 the amount of as v in the tested surface water was 0 280 mg l which is almost 28 times higher than the drinking water regulations 10 μg l in this surface water contain 68 32 mg l of ca2 8 406 mg l of na 8 943 mg l of k 11 47 mg l of mg2 14 1 mg l of cl 43 4 mg l of so4 3 14 8 mg l of no3 172 mg l of hco3 and 0 104 mg l of total iron however cr iii and pb ii were not found in the real surface water 0 280 mg l of cr iii and pb ii spiked to this surface water the fixed bed column tests were carried out using with a constant flow rate of 5 ml min across the columns at ph 6 between two layers of glass wool the column was filled with adsorbent 0 2 g with 2 cm height in a 5 cm column a peristaltic pump was used to control the intake flow rate of synthetic wastewater which was collected in a bucket the bottom of the column was connected with rubber tubing and a flow adjustable clamp as a result the clamp was used to regulate the outflow rate the samples were taken at regular intervals and kept evaluating the metal ion content with icp oes the flowing of all metal ion solution across the bed was maintained until no further adsorption occurred all of the studies were done at room temperature the slow absorption of metal ions in the early phases subsequently increased rates and ultimately attained saturation at 6000 bed volume for all metals can be seen in fig 8 for the same starting cr iii pb ii and as v concentration 0 280 mg l the equilibrium adsorption capabilities of the ggo gd2o3 in column and batch experiments are similar moreover the effluent concentration was suppressed under epa standards for all metal ions around 1500 bed volume this result suggest that the developed material can be potential used for real water system treatment 4 conclusions granules go gd2o3 were successfully synthesized using appropriate concentrations of sa and cmc the sem tem and bet results found that ggo gd2o3 is a spherical granular adsorbent with an average diameter of 2 mm and a bet surface area of 2 757 m2 g outperforming other granular materials further xrd xps and ft ir results confirmed the adsorbent surface functional groups such as oh co o c o and cooh in addition to gd2o3 which are promote metal adsorptive removal the optimal values of ph ggo gd2o3 dosage and time of adsorption were ascertained from the results of the batch experiments to be 4 0 1 4 g l and 1080 min respectively single contaminant samples for all metal ions examined the adsorption kinetics and isotherm findings indicated that adsorption was a rate limiting monolayer on the uniform surface of the adsorbent thermodynamic studies showed that cr iii and as v adsorb physicochemical whereas pb ii physiosorbed the maximum adsorption capacities of ggo gd2o3 for cr iii pb ii and as v were 29 16 158 23 and 36 77 mg g respectively these values were comparable to those achieved by similar granular adsorbents reported in contemporary works the xps spectra analysis and batch investigations results concluded that heavy metal ion adsorptive removal carried out mostly by surface complexation and ion exchange rather than electrostatic contact this study s findings on the sorption characteristics of batch and column systems could be used to develop a sorption system for heavy metal ion polluted wastewater treatment data availability the raw processed data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time as the data also forms part of an ongoing study declaration of competing interest none acknowledgment this study was funded in part by the

13151,this study co treated landfill leachate and municipal wastewater employing unsaturated partially saturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands the wetland systems were packed with organic or waste materials and planted with phragmites australis leachate and municipal wastewater were mixed in different volumetric proportions 40 60 20 80 10 90 for co treatment under variable wastewater retention periods i e 6 and 24 h mean biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand ammonium nitrogen total nitrogen phosphorus removal percentage ranged between 35 and 76 22 and 76 10 and 90 0 2 and 71 38 and 92 respectively the combination of higher influent pollutants load due to higher leachate volumetric proportion in the mixed wastewater and longer retention time developed a predominant anoxic anaerobic environment inside the media of the unsaturated partially saturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow wetlands such environmental conditions diminished organic and nutrient removal by hampering electrochemically active other removal pathways particularly in partially saturated wetlands leachate volumetric proportion reduction adjusted the influent s pollutant loads carbon and other chemical composition increased aerobic gradient inside the media bed and improved pollutants removal of the unsaturated partially saturated systems a longer wastewater retention period supplemented operational performance mean voltage production across the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands ranged between 4 and 152 mv maximum power

introduction microbial fuel cell mfc constructed wetlands are novel energy producing intensified wastewater treatment technologies that emerged from traditionally designed plant and media based wetland systems 1 2 organic compounds are electrochemically oxidized in the anaerobic anode compartment of a microbial fuel cell based constructed wetland 2 the produced electrons are accepted by the anode and transferred to the cathode electrode that completes the circuit reactions in the presence of oxygen 3 5 the produced electrons also support other microbial pollutants removal routes such as classical denitrification 6 the operational performance of the microbial fuel cell based constructed wetlands heavily depends on maintaining the required aerobic anaerobic gradient between the electrodes 2 vertical upflow systems received particular attention in microbial fuel cell integrated wetland studies to achieve simultaneous wastewater treatment and bioenergy production 7 10 a major disadvantage of such commonly designed systems could be attributed to their inefficiencies in achieving satisfactory pollutants removal performance particularly nitrogen when subjected to higher input organic load 11 under these loading circumstances the electrochemical based pollutants oxidation in the anode zone decreases resulting in untreated pollutant loads movement toward the cathode compartment 12 such a situation depletes available oxygen around the cathode electrode oxygen is required to support aerobic nitrification in the cathode zone and maintain the redox gradient between the electrodes for electron movement 2 13 14 the operational drawback of the upflow microbial fuel cell integrated constructed wetlands was counterbalanced employing other hydraulic flow pattern based systems such as downflow integrated downflow upflow and horizontal flow based electrodes integrated constructed wetlands 2 8 13 15 17 more recent studies proposed an advanced approach by incorporating tidal flow i e sequential wastewater fill retention drain protocols strategies into the microbial fuel cell based constructed wetlands such a combination resulted in the evolution of a novel treatment system commonly referred to as unsaturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands 6 18 21 retained wastewater is completely discharged during the drain period the unsaturated media is filled with wastewater during the subsequent feeding cycle 22 sequential wastewater drain and retention protocols passively pump and utilize atmospheric oxygen inside the media respectively 23 such sequential alternative environmental conditions establish the required aerobic anaerobic gradient between electrodes to support higher pollutants removal and bioenergy production in microbial fuel cell based unsaturated tidal flow wetlands 6 partially saturated normal without electrodes tidal flow constructed wetlands have been developed recently for wastewater treatment wastewater retained inside the media is discharged partially from these systems during the drain period to maintain a constant water level in the bottom portion of the media 24 25 the overlying unsaturated media is filled with wastewater during the subsequent feeding cycle the coexistence of overlying unsaturated and underlying saturated media supports aerobic anaerobic pollutants removal kinetics during wastewater feeding retention periods thus improving overall performance 25 the existence of predominant anaerobic conditions in the bottom media of partially saturated tidal flow wetlands could support anaerobic electrochemical organic matter oxidation if microbial fuel cells are incorporated but had not been reported to date regarding operational efficiency the literature review shows higher pollutants removal performances of the microbial fuel cell integrated unsaturated tidal flow constructed wetlands that received either municipal sewage or synthetic wastewater organic nitrogen phosphorus removal percentages ranged between 72 and 100 58 and 86 80 and 100 respectively in electrodes integrated tidal flow systems that received municipal sewage 6 21 with synthetic wastewater based systems organic nitrogen removal percentages ranged between 73 and 98 50 and 85 respectively phosphorus removal was not reported in these studies 18 19 wastewater retention times ranging between 2 and 24 h have been reported for achieving such removal performances moreover wastewater retention time and pollutants removal rates increment were positively correlated in these studies it should be noted that the previously reported studies chose medium organic strength municipal or synthetic wastewater as the influent the adverse impact of higher input organic load on the operational performance of traditionally designed upflow microbial fuel cell based wetlands is documented in the literature 11 26 as such a knowledge gap exists on the pollutants removal performances of recently developed microbial fuel cell based tidal flow wetlands when dosed with wastewater with a more complex chemical composition or high organic strength i e landfill leachate ll wastewater or a mixture of municipal domestic wastewater mw dw leachate i e leachate co treatment 27 28 adverse impact on pollutants removal performance with normal constructed wetlands without electrodes had been reported in the literature when employed for landfill leachate treatment or co treatment with municipal sewage 27 29 high organic strength of such wastewaters and inappropriate wastewater retention time might disrupt the operational performances of the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands and have not been investigated to date media is a critical wetland component that supports chemical and microbial based pollutants removal routes because of inherent chemical composition and surface properties 30 natural organic construction and waste materials were employed as the main media in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands that improved wastewater pollutants removal and bioenergy production 6 21 31 therefore additional studies are required to investigate the influence of media on the operational performances of electrodes integrated tidal flow wetlands when employed for landfill leachate co treatment with municipal sewage in this study unsaturated and partially saturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands were employed for landfill leachate co treatment with municipal sewage that had not been reported to date the experimental systems were packed with different organic palm biochar coconut and waste jhama surkhi tire materials to assess the influence of media in improving pollutants removal performance and bioenergy production two wastewater retention periods i e hydraulic retention time hrt i e 6 and 24 h were employed to identify the correlation between hrt and operational performance variation the main objective of this study was to assess the integrated impact wastewater composition hrt saturation and media variation on common pollutants nitrogen phosphorus and organics removal kinetics and bioenergy production in microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands when employed for landfill leachate co treatment 2 materials and method 2 1 construction of the wetland systems six subsurface flow constructed wetlands namely a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 and a6 were built at the university of asia pacific dhaka bangladesh the constructed wetlands were made of polyvinyl chloride pvc pipes the height and diameter of each constructed wetland were 0 91 and 0 15 m respectively the wetlands were filled with organic materials and waste materials wetland systems a1 a2 and a5 were filled with organic palm fiber biochar and dried green coconut respectively the remaining three wetlands i e a3 a4 and a6 wetland units were filled with waste materials jhama brick brick shurki and rubber tire respectively a brief description of the media along with physical properties i e porosity and size is available in table 1 the media porosity was calculated following the saturation method protocol 21 the operational diagram of the wetland systems is illustrated in fig 1a pictorial plates of the employed media are illustrated in fig 1b the main media achieved 0 82 m depth in each constructed wetland regarding electrode material type carbon or metal based materials were used as electrodes in microbial fuel cell based wetlands 2 32 although carbon based electrodes possess better biocompatibility significant power density production differences were not observed between carbonaceous or metallic electrodes based microbial fuel cell constructed wetlands 32 34 in this study metallic electrodes were selected two aluminium plates 0 1 m 0 1 m were used as cathode and anode electrodes in each constructed wetland these plates were buried in the media of each wetland and placed at a distance of 0 31 m from the top or bottom portion of the main media the distance between the two plates was 0 2 m in each unit the anode and cathode plates of each microbial fuel cell integrated constructed wetland were connected by electrically insulated copper wires a 20 000 ω resistor a multimeter and were separated by a glass wool thermal insulator foam large stones 0 012 m in size on the top and bottom portions of the main media allowed influent distribution and effluent discharge all wetland units were planted with phragmites after plantation the wetlands were waterlogged for 24 weeks to allow plant growth and maturation 2 2 operational protocols the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands received wastewater that was a mixture of landfill leachate ll and municipal wastewater mw commonly referred to as landfill leachate co treatment with sewage the landfill leachate was collected from the matuail landfill site of dhaka city municipal wastewater was collected from a sewage outlet table 2 summarizes the mean chemical composition of the landfill leachate and municipal wastewater the mean ph values demonstrate that the leachate was slightly alkaline whereas the municipal wastewater was slightly acidic the leachate was more anoxic according to the mean redox profiles nitrogen phosphorus organic and solids concentration of the leachate wastewater was substantially higher than municipal wastewater organic biodegradation ratio i e the ratio between bod and cod concentration bod cod of the leachate and municipal wastewater was 0 26 and 0 31 respectively these values show that leachate and municipal wastewater was primarily composed of recalcitrant organic compounds as a ratio 0 5 indicates the presence of biodegradable organic compounds in wastewater 35 the ratio between organic and nitrogen concentration i e cod tn of the leachate and municipal wastewater was 2 22 and 5 67 respectively the experimental design includes three operational periods the volumetric ratio of leachate and municipal wastewater for preparing influent wastewater was 40 ll 60 mw in the first operational period phase i 20 ll 80 mw in the second operational period phase ii 10 ll 90 mw in the third operational period phase iii a gradual decrease of landfill leachate volumetric proportion through effluent recirculation or co treatment with municipal sewage to improve pollutants removal performance employing normal without electrodes integration constructed wetlands has been reported 29 36 the duration of each experimental phase was 6 weeks resulting in 18 weeks of experimental investigation the wetlands were fed with wastewater for 12 weeks before the experimental protocol to achieve removal performance stability the microbial fuel cell integrated constructed wetlands were operated as tidal flow systems that included sequential wastewater fill retention and drain periods within a single dosing cycle per day at the beginning of each dosing cycle wastewater i e the mixture of ll and mw was dosed within 10 min in each wetland that filled the media pore spaces after filling wastewater was retained in each wetland for a pre defined hrt the retained wastewater was drained within 10 min the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands were subjected to two hrts i e 6 h and 24 h during each operational phase the duration of each hrt based operation within a single phase was 3 weeks the selected hrts of this study were almost similar to the previously reported wastewater retention times of the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow unsaturated constructed wetlands that received medium organic strength municipal sewage 21 hrt increment from 8 to 24 h improved pollutants removal rates in such previously reported systems therefore this study would demonstrate the impact of previously reported wastewater retention periods on pollutants removal performance in microbial fuel cell integrated unsaturated partially saturated tidal flow constructed wetlands that received wastewater with higher organic strength the six microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands were operated as unsaturated or partially saturated systems systems a1 a4 functioned as unsaturated systems wastewater was fully drained from such systems after completing the pre defined hrt such repeated dry and wet period cycles allow for the sequential development of aerobic and anoxic anaerobic environments inside the bed matrix thus promoting associated pollutants removal kinetics 22 25 37 systems a5 a6 wetlands operated as partially saturated systems because of partial wastewater discharge that allowed maintaining a constant water level 0 43 m depth in the bottom portion of the media a constant water level develops a predominant anoxic anaerobic environment in the bottom portion of the media and supports associated removal kinetics 25 each unsaturated and partially saturated system received 6 l 340 mm d and 3 l 170 mm d wastewater respectively during a single dosing cycle table 3 illustrates the outflow across the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands within three operational phases 2 3 sample analysis 2 3 1 wastewater quality influent and effluent samples were collected weekly from the six microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands these samples were analyzed immediately at environmental engineering and chemistry laboratory department of civil engineering university of asia pacific environmental parameters i

chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss were measured the analysis protocol of wastewater samples has been described elsewhere 25 2 3 2 media adsorption capacities nh4 n p adsorption capacities of the unused fresh and used collected from the six wetlands after completion of the experiment palm fiber biochar dried green coconut jhama brick brick surkhi and rubber tire samples were quantified according to the protocol described by zhu cui 38 in brief synthetic 20 ml ammonium chloride nh4cl of 50 mg l concentration and 20 ml potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 of 50 mg l concentration solutions were prepared such prepared n and p solutions were exposed to 3 g of unused fresh or used media for 48 h the produced supernatant was analyzed for n and p using spectrophotometric methods to measure the media s adsorption capacities 2 3 3 nutrient uptake by plants phragmites plants were harvested from six wetlands at the end of the experimental period for measuring nutrient accumulation the harvested plant biomass was divided into leaf shoots root the divided portions were oven dried at 80 c temperature for four days until the constant dry weight was achieved dried leaves shoots root portions were powdered digestion distillation and vanadomolybdophosphoric yellow color methods were employed for measuring nitrogen and phosphorus contents of the powdered biomass respectively a brief description of the plant nutrient analysis protocol has been described by saeed miah 21 2 3 4 electrochemical parameters the voltage u millivolts mv production across the external resistor r ohms ω of each constructed wetland was measured the current density i milliamperes m3 ma m3 and power density p milliwatts m3 mw m3 production were calculated with respect to anode volume in m3 the organic compound degradation based electron generation efficiency of the wetlands was measured by coulombic efficiency ce according to eq 1 4 1 ce mi fbq cod where m

effluent wastewater across the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands during the three operational periods the mean ph concentration of the influent wastewater that was the mixture of leachate and municipal wastewater in different proportions ranged between 7 6 and 8 during phases i iii the mean effluent ph across the microbial fuel cell based wetlands slightly decreased compared to influent profiles ranging between 7 2 and 7 9 during the three operational periods effluent ph values across all microbial fuel cell based wetlands of 24 h wastewater hrt exceeded those of 6 h hrt during phase i phase iii period showed the opposite trend effluent ph concentration of 6 h hrt exceeded those of 24 h hrt in the intermediate operational period phase ii a mixed trend i e higher or lower effluent ph during 24 h hrt compared to preceding 6 h hrt profiles was observed wastewater ph changes in constructed wetlands depend on fatty acid production alkalinity consumption and generation because of anaerobic organic degradation nitrification and denitrification respectively 39 40 redox profile is a critical parameter in microbial fuel cell based wetlands as it indicates the environmental conditions of the bed matrix to support pollutants removal and bioenergy production the mean influent redox profile eh was anoxic anaerobic in nature that ranged between 75 3 and 39 mv within phases i iii fig 2 the mean effluent redox profiles produced across the microbial fuel cell based tidal wetland systems during phase i were more anoxic anaerobic in nature compared to influent profiles the mean effluent redox profiles ranged between 125 and 29 mv during the first operation period phase i the redox profiles of the effluent samples produced during the longer hrt i e 24 h were more anoxic or anaerobic in nature than those of 6 h hrt in phase i fig 2 constructed wetlands receive oxygen because of atmospheric diffusion and plant root based leakage 7 complete media saturation for a longer period in phase i decreased atmospheric oxygen diffusion in the media that could not be counterbalanced by plant based oxygen leakage because of higher influent organic strength and associated available oxygen consumption by different pollutants removal kinetics during the last two operational periods ii and iii the effluent redox profiles across the wetland systems were less anoxic in nature compared to corresponding profiles of the first operational period the mean redox profiles of the effluent samples ranged between 5 and 83 mv 58 and 119 mv during phases ii iii respectively influent organic and inorganic pollutants strength decreased within the last two phases due to volumetric proportion reduction of the leachate in the mixed wastewater discussed in sections 3 3 3 4 such strength reduction could have increased effluent redox potentials during the last two phases compared to the first phase as organic matter is often oxidized in the presence of an electron acceptor i e oxygen 2 14 3 2 role of wetland components on pollutants removal plant and media wetland plants contribute to wastewater nutrient n and p removal through uptake kinetics 41 table 4 summarizes plant biomass weight kg n and p accumulation g kg in aboveground shoot leaf and underground root portions of phragmites planted into the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands as observed in table 4 nutrient accumulation g kg in the aboveground portion exceeded the underground portion n p accumulation percentage in aboveground or underground plant tissue was low i e 2 and 2 4 respectively with respect to total removal based on influent effluent analysis low nutrient uptake of wetland plants had also been reported with normal without electrodes constructed wetlands 36 due to substantial input loading that exceeded the uptake capacity of plants 24 therefore other removal routes could also have influenced the nutrient removal in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands and will be discussed in the following sections cation exchange sites on wetland media surfaces promote wastewater nh4 n adsorption whereas ca al fe components of the wetland media surfaces trigger wastewater p adsorption 42 43 to identify whether such kinetics influenced wastewater nutrient removal in this study nutrient adsorption capacity of the unused used organic and waste materials employed as the main media in the microbial fuel cell tidal flow constructed wetlands was assessed according to the protocol described in section 2 3 results are summarized in fig 3 as observed in fig 3 initial nh4 n 50 mg l and p 50 mg l concentration of the nh4cl and kh2po4 solutions decreased when exposed to unused and used organic waste materials such concentration decrease confirms nh4 n and p adsorption capacities of the employed media the nutrient adsorption capacity of the unused used organic waste materials was further investigated through energy dispersive spectroscopy eds analysis that quantified the elemental composition of the employed materials supplementary material s1 according to the eds analysis elemental n percentages were high in most used media compared to unused samples the presence of specific cations i e calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 potassium k and sodium na influence nh4 n adsorption in media 44 in this study elemental percentage changes of such cations between unused and used media were observed supplementary material s1 therefore cation exchange dependent nh4 n removal could have occurred in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands 43 it should be noted that wastewater nh4 n sinking into the media is a temporal removal route the bounded or wastewater nh4 n could be subjected to microbial decomposition 45 which will be discussed in section 3 4 media based adsorption influences p removal in constructed wetlands through ligand and ion exchanges specific media composed of calcium ca aluminium al and iron fe reinforces such adsorption in constructed wetlands 42 46 these elements were present in unused and the used media employed in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands supplementary material s1 therefore media based p adsorption could have existed in the wetland systems of this study and will be discussed in section 3 5 3 3 organic matter removal influent effluent organic bod and cod concentration profiles and corresponding removal percentages of the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands within the three operational periods are presented in figs 4 and 5 the mean bod cod removal percentages within the experimental systems ranged between 35 and 76 22 and 76 respectively within phases i iii the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands achieved low organic removal percentages during both hrts i e 6 and 24 h of phase i period when leachate proportion was higher in the mixed wastewater higher influent cod concentration i e 1536 mg l in phase i could significantly influence such observed performance wang tian 12 reported that higher cod concentration 1000 mg l of wastewater disrupts electrochemically organic decomposition in anode zone such inhibition results in cod accumulation around the cathode in conjunction with predominant anaerobic environment development inside the media of microbial fuel cell based constructed wetlands similar phenomena could have also occurred in microbial fuel cell tidal flow wetland systems of this study thus disrupting the aerobic anoxic anaerobic gradient between the electrodes 2 and diminishing overall cod removal performances during both hrts of phase i the effluent samples produced across all microbial fuel cell based tidal flow wetlands during 24 h hrt of phase i fig 2 were more anoxic in nature compared to those of the preceding 6 h hrt bod or cod removal also decreased in the experimental wetland systems during 24 h hrt of phase i compared to those of the preceding 6 h hrt figs 4 and 5 the combination of higher wastewater organic strength and longer hrt triggered the development of anoxic anaerobic environment inside bed matrix such environmental conditions disrupted the required redox gradient between the electrodes and reduced electrochemical based organic oxidation in anode compartment 2 although longer hrt improved organic removal performance in microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands 18 this study shows opposite phenomena primarily because of influent organic strength variation on the other hand a decrease in leachate volume proportion within the last two phases reduced the organic strength 522 mg l cod of the influent leachate municipal mixed wastewater fig 5 influent organic strength decrease during the last two phases supported electrochemically organic removal and prevented cod accumulation around the cathode these factors established the required aerobic anaerobic gradient between the electrodes and improved electrochemical based organic removal figs 4 and 5 in the wetland systems of this study 6 8 positive increment of effluent redox values during the last two phases fig 2 also supports such hypothesis regardless of performance improvement the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow wetlands in this study achieved lower cod removal during the last two phases fig 5 compared to cod removal profiles 97 9 of an electrode integrated tidal flow wetland system dosed with artificial wastewater 19 cod concentration of the reported artificial wastewater i e 514 mg l coincided with the influent wastewater profiles during the last two phases fig 5 reported in this study the wetland systems of this study received real wastewater that might have caused performance disparity because of more complex chemical composition of real wastewater on the other hand cod removal of the experimental systems during the last two phases when leachate volumetric proportion decreased was higher than that i e 10 to 17 of a gravel media packed normal without electrodes vertical flow wetland that received real landfill leachate 29 decrease of leachate volumetric proportion through leachate co treatment produced such reported organic removal performances therefore electrodes integration might favor organic removal from real wastewater because of electrochemical based organic oxidation in tidal flow constructed wetlands under suitable influent organic concentration as observed in this study 3 4 nitrogen removal influent effluent nh4 n concentration profiles and corresponding removal percentages of the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands within the three operational periods are presented in fig 6 the mean nh4 n removal percentages of the experimental systems ranged between 10 and 90 within phases i iii nh4 n removal in constructed wetlands is often achieved through aerobic microbial nitrification 24 25 47 therefore anaerobic conditions development inside the media of the experimental wetlands reduced overall nh4 n removal performance in phase i fig 6 that was counterbalanced by aerobic gradient development as indicated by effluent redox profiles fig 2 during the latter two phases however the 24 h hrt in phase i resulted in comparatively better nh4 n removal than the preceding 6 h phase in the wetland systems of this study such phenomena were not observed in terms of organic removal due to adverse environmental conditions longer wastewater retention time favored other nh4 n removal routes i e plant uptake table 4 media based adsorption fig 3 and supplementary material s1 along nitrification 48 better nh4 n removal was continued in all wetland systems during 24 h hrt of the latter two phases that coincided with organic removal pattern and effluent redox profiles increment substantial nh4 n removal improvement in all wetland systems during 24 h hrt of the last two phases when environmental conditions were less anoxic suggests that microbial nitrification was the dominant nh4 n removal mechanism in this study it should be noted that organic and nh4 n removal performance in the partially saturated systems a5 and a6 was severely influenced during both hrts of phase i hrt increment from 6 to 24 h during phase i increased effluent bod concentration over influent values partially saturated media longer wastewater hrt i e 24 h and high influent organic strength could have been the contributing factors however decreased influent organic strength because of leachate proportion reduction in the mixed wastewater substantially improved the organic and nh4 n removal performance in the partially saturated wetlands during the last two operational periods these results suggest that partially saturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands should not be designed to treat wastewater with substantial organic strength the mean influent no2 n and no3 n concentration across the wetland systems was 0 06 and 6 3 mg l respectively within the three operational periods no2 n no3 n mean effluent concentration across the wetland systems ranged between 0 03 and 0 2 mg l 4 8 and 8 8 mg l respectively effluent no2 n concentration increase or decrease was quantified no3 n removal percentage ranged between 13 and 24 within the three operational phases fig 7 presents influent effluent tn concentration profiles and associated removal percentages the mean tn removal percentages ranged between 7 and 69 within phases i iii tn removal percentages in all wetland systems were higher during the latter two phases than in phase i no3 n and tn removals in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands indicate the influence of classical denitrification such kinetics heavily depends upon nitrification rates and organic carbon c availability 6 19 48 higher nitrification rates produced more no3 n for denitrification during the latter two phases the other factor i e c availability is often assessed through wastewater cod tn ratio a ratio ranging between 3 and 9 supports denitrification kinetics in constructed wetlands 12 49 the mean influent wastewater cod tn ratio was 3 2 3 4 and 5 9 in phases i ii and iii respectively influent cod tn ratio and tn removal percentage of the wetland systems increment were positively correlated decreased leachate volumetric proportion in the mixed leachate municipal wastewater improved the overall cod tn ratio that favored denitrification based tn removal in the microbial fuel cell tidal flow wetland systems during the last two phases wastewater retention time dependent 6 vs 24 h of a single phase analysis showed better tn removal in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands during the 6 h hrt of phase i or ii fig 7 such a trend could be attributed to c consumption competition between the electrogenic and denitrifying microbial population 6 50 that could have been intensified under a longer hrt i e 24 h of phases i ii thus resulting in tn removal decrease however an opposite trend was observed during the last phase the 24 h hrt of the last phase resulted in better tn removal the maximum influent cod tn ratio i e 5 9 was quantified during the last phase that supported the metabolism of both microbial populations during a longer hrt overall tn removal performance in microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow wetlands during the last phase is comparable with that 67 tn removal of a pilot scale normal without electrodes integration tidal flow wetlands that received anaerobically digested wastewater 51 the cod 565 mg l and tn 169 mg l concentration of the reported digested wastewater coincided with the concentration profiles of leachate municipal sewage mixed wastewater employed in this study during phase iii figs 5 and 7 as such the results of this study support the potential application of microbial cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands to achieve satisfactory nitrogen removal from real wastewater depending on organic composition and biodegradability 3 5 media based removal performance regarding organic removal performances of the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands with respect to the employed media organic palm fiber biochar green coconut media based unsaturated and partially saturated systems achieved a mean 35 to 64 and 13 to 60 organic removal percentages respectively throughout the experimental campaign waste media jhama surkhi rubber tire based unsaturated and partially saturated systems achieved a mean of 7 to 62 and 4 to 66 organic removal percentages respectively regarding tn removal performance organic media based unsaturated and partially saturated systems achieved a mean of 33 to 69 and 30 to 68 nitrogen removal percentages respectively waste media based unsaturated and partially saturated systems achieved a mean of 25 to 60 and 7 to 69 nitrogen removal percentages respectively upper removal percentages were observed during the latter two operational phases when operational conditions were more favorable for supporting pollutants removal these results also suggest that although organic media based wetland systems were more efficient under adverse conditions i e when influent organic concentration was high removal performance within the two materials based systems was almost similar under more favorable conditions i e when influent organic concentration reduced the c composition of the employed media influences denitrification in constructed wetland systems 52 the unused organic palm biochar coconut materials were composed of c in substantial percentages as illustrated by the eds analysis supplementary material s1 such a composition of the organic materials could have supplied c to the denitrifiers and assisted in achieving better tn removal in the corresponding microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands 39 53 compared to waste material based systems during the three phases the positive impact of organic materials as wetland media in supplying c and supporting denitrification had also been reported with tidal flow based normal without electrodes constructed wetlands 25 54 although c content of the media provided an additional advantage to support tn removal in organic media based wetlands the removal performances of the waste material based wetlands more specifically those of the tire packed system during the latter two operational periods should not be overruled fig 7 the pictorial plates of the unused rubber tire samples indicate the presence of micropores on media surface areas fig 1b whereas thick layer formation was observed on the surface of used tire samples supplementary material s2 as such the physical properties of tire media might have produced ideal conditions to support the growth of diverse biofilm 31 moreover the presence of a higher c percentage proportion of the unused tire samples supplementary material s1 could have triggered the metabolism of the denitrifiers probably in the deeper portion of the formed biofilm on the tire media surface 6 in addition the partially saturated wetlands packed with either organic coconut or waste tire material removed tn that was comparable to organic palm biochar or waste jhama surkhi materials packed unsaturated systems within the last two phases therefore partially saturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands could also be employed for wastewater treatment depending on wastewater composition influent effluent overall tp concentration and associated removal percentages during each of the three operational phases of the wetland systems are presented in fig 8 tp removal percentages ranged between 47 and 89 within phases i iii the removal percentage in all wetland systems was higher during the latter two phases the 24 h hrt of such phases was more efficient in removing influent tp removal plant uptake and media based adsorption kinetics influence tp removal in subsurface flow constructed wetlands 42 46 in this study the tp accumulation percentage of the phragmites plants was not substantial table 4 with respect to overall influent effluent based removal adsorption capacity analysis fig 4 shows the existence of a media based tp adsorption route that achieved comparatively better tp removal performances in all wetland systems primarily because of the presence of ca al fe elements supplementary material s1 42 throughout the experimental campaign the mean p removal percentage of the organic waste media based wetlands ranged between 47 and 79 48 and 89 respectively these results specify higher p adsorption capacities of the employed waste materials particularly when influent tp concentration decreased during the last two phases that additionally increased adsorption capacities longer hrt further improved adsorption kinetics the overall p removal percentage in organic waste media based electrodes integrated tidal flow wetlands coincided with previously reported p removal that ranged between 46 and 90 employing waste alum sludge packed microbial fuel cell based wetlands 8 10 therefore the organic and waste materials reported in this study might be used as the main media in constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment 3 6 electrochemical parameters 3 6 1 voltage production and polarization curves fig 9 summarizes mean voltage production mv across the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands with respect to time measured between 10 min after hydraulic loading and 10 min before wastewater discharge within a single dosing cycle according to fig 9 jhama based a3 system achieved the highest overall mean voltage production i e 152 mv within a single dosing cycle during 6 h hrt of phase i waste tire based a6 system achieved the highest mean voltage production ranging between 23 and 124 mv during 24 h hrt of phase i and both hrts of the latter two operational phases other waste jhama a3 surkhi a4 organic material based wetlands palm a1 biochar a2 coconut a5 systems achieved similar mean voltage production within such periods mean voltage production ranged between 10 and 42 mv 4 and 45 mv respectively throughout the experimental campaign the mean power density production within the six microbial fuel cell based tidal flow wetlands ranged between 1 and 64 mw m3 the tire material packed system achieved the highest power density production a few research studies also reported power density production differences among microbial fuel cell integrated wetlands because of media variation yakar türe 31 reported power density production ranging between 5 and 27 mw m2 within the sand zeolite volcanic cinder packed upflow microbial fuel cell integrated wetlands saeed and jihad miah 6 reported power density production ranging between 8 and 352 mw m2 employing tidal flow based microbial fuel cell integrated wetlands filled with organic construction and waste materials physical properties of the media such as porosity rough textures allow substantial microbial population attachment on media surfaces improving electrochemical based organic oxidation and bioenergy production 31 the scanning electron microscope sem images indicate differences in surface structure between unused organic and waste materials employed as the main media in this study supplementary material s2 the used samples represented different characteristics more void spaces were observed on the surface areas of the used biochar primarily because of microbial degradation 6 thick solid layers were formed on the surface areas of other used samples particularly on used tire samples surface probably because of solid root fragments deposition and microbial film formation 55 that supported electrochemical based kinetics the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands were connected to the external resistors ranging between 100 and 27 000 ω for measuring current production losses that might have occurred inside the systems throughout the three operational phases such protocol is referred to as polarization test the mean results of the polarization test obtained from three phases i e current density power density voltage production are presented in fig 10 according to the polarization curves the maximum power density production was 50 157 182 186 155 527 mw m3 across the a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 and a6 systems respectively when connected to 1000 ω external resistor the current density was the lowest when voltage was maximum and agreed with the previously reported trend 15 three loss patterns such as the initial sharp voltage drop activation loss mid stage slow voltage drop ohmic loss and last stage fast voltage drop under high current intensities concentration loss were observed in the polarization curve the polarization curves of other studies also demonstrated similar trends 3 56 these losses occur because of poor organic matter degradation kinetics ohmic resistance development and organic c depletion in the anode zone respectively 14 the polarization curves also indicate that the major current losses in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands of this study were due to ohmic loss 15 the partially saturated tire media based system a6 produced the highest maximum power density 527 mw m3 that exceeded the maximum power density production 50 to 186 mw m3 of other systems in this study in addition the tire based system s maximum power density production was substantially higher than those i e 16 to 214 mw m3 of the reported microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow wetlands 18 19 partial saturation was not the primary factor that caused higher power density production across the tire media based system a6 as the other organic media dried coconut based partially saturated system a5 achieved low maximum power density production 155 mw m3 than the partially saturated tire based system moreover the unsaturated biochar a2 jhama brick a3 and surkhi a4 media packed systems achieved maximum power density production ranging between 157 and 186 mw m3 that was beyond that of partially saturated coconut material packed system a5 but beneath that of partially saturated tire packed system a6 therefore within the two variables i e saturation and media differences among the six microbial fuel cell wetlands the latter factor i e media influenced bioenergy production due to chemical such as carbon composition supplementary material s1 and physical rough surfaces voids supplementary material s2 properties variation of the media 6 31 it should be noted that the experimental wetlands of this study particularly the tire media packed system achieved substantial power density production despite a low surface area of the employed metallic aluminium anode electrode therefore such metallic material might be used as an anode electrode in microbial fuel cell based constructed wetlands that were also reported in previous studies low cost easy availability of the employed material could reduce operational expenses 21 57 3 6 2 ce and ner the operational efficiencies of the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands had been investigated through coulombic efficiency ce and net energy recovery ner 4 the calculated values employing eqs 1 and 2 are presented in fig 11 that represents scattered plots between influent cod vs ce and ce vs ner a sharp ce percentage decrease in all systems was observed when influent cod concentration increased between 0 and 700 mg l ranges fig 11a similar phenomena were previously reported 8 such a trend confirms that electrogenic microbial metabolic activities and associated electron production performance in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands were severely hindered by high influent cod concentration and justified by comparatively overall low organic removal performances during the phase i period it should be noted that ce values might not depict the actual performance of the microbial fuel cell because of the substrate electron consumption by electrochemically inactive microbial population and circuit bypassing of the generated electron 7 58 therefore ner values were also calculated and plotted against ce percentage values as presented in fig 11b according to the scattered plots ner and ce values increment were interdependent for all microbial fuel cell based systems this trend also confirms the operational performance decrease of the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow wetlands when subjected to high influent cod loading 4 conclusions organic nitrogen and phosphorus removal percentage ranged between 22 and 62 0 2 and 56 47 and 60 respectively within the unsaturated and partially saturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow wetlands when the volumetric proportion of the leachate was high 40 ll 60 mw such removal performance improved ranging between 38 and 76 24 and 84 60 and 89 respectively when the co treatment ratio of the leachate decreased i e 20 ll 80 mw and 10 ll 90 mw a higher volumetric proportion of landfill leachate increased influent pollutants strength that did not favor electrochemically active inactive pollutants removal routes more specifically during longer wastewater retention period i e 24 h the combination of influent pollutants strength reduction due to volumetric proportion reduction of the leachate and a longer wastewater retention period improved overall removal performance in the wetland systems of this study nitrification denitrification and media based adsorption controlled nitrogen and phosphorus removals respectively the waste tire based system achieved maximum power density production 527 mw m3 that exceeded the maximum power density production 50 to 186 mw m3 across other organic and waste material packed systems physicochemical properties variation of the media influenced power density production in general this study identifies

13151,this study co treated landfill leachate and municipal wastewater employing unsaturated partially saturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands the wetland systems were packed with organic or waste materials and planted with phragmites australis leachate and municipal wastewater were mixed in different volumetric proportions 40 60 20 80 10 90 for co treatment under

and 76 10 and 90 0 2 and 71 38 and 92 respectively the combination of higher influent pollutants load due to higher leachate volumetric proportion in the mixed wastewater and longer retention time developed a predominant anoxic anaerobic environment inside the media of the unsaturated partially saturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow wetlands such environmental conditions diminished organic and nutrient removal by hampering electrochemically active other removal pathways particularly in partially saturated wetlands leachate volumetric proportion reduction adjusted the influent s pollutant loads carbon and other chemical composition increased aerobic gradient inside the media bed and improved pollutants removal of the unsaturated partially saturated systems a longer wastewater

introduction microbial fuel cell mfc constructed wetlands are novel energy producing intensified wastewater treatment technologies that emerged from traditionally designed plant and media based wetland systems 1 2 organic compounds are electrochemically oxidized in the anaerobic anode compartment of a microbial fuel cell based constructed wetland 2 the produced electrons are accepted by the anode and transferred to the cathode electrode that completes the circuit reactions in the presence of oxygen 3 5 the produced electrons also support other microbial pollutants removal routes such as classical denitrification 6 the operational performance of the microbial fuel cell based constructed wetlands heavily depends on maintaining the required aerobic anaerobic gradient between the electrodes 2 vertical upflow systems received particular attention in microbial fuel cell integrated wetland studies to achieve simultaneous wastewater treatment and bioenergy production 7 10 a major disadvantage of such commonly designed systems could be attributed to their inefficiencies in achieving satisfactory pollutants removal performance particularly nitrogen when subjected to higher input organic load 11 under these loading circumstances the electrochemical based pollutants oxidation in the anode zone decreases resulting in untreated pollutant loads movement toward the cathode compartment 12 such a situation depletes available oxygen around the cathode electrode oxygen is required to support aerobic nitrification in the cathode zone and maintain the redox gradient between the electrodes for electron movement 2 13 14 the operational drawback of the upflow microbial fuel cell integrated constructed wetlands was counterbalanced employing other hydraulic flow pattern based systems such as downflow integrated downflow upflow and horizontal flow based electrodes integrated constructed wetlands 2 8 13 15 17 more recent studies proposed an advanced approach by incorporating tidal flow i e sequential wastewater fill retention drain protocols strategies into the microbial fuel cell based constructed wetlands such a combination resulted in the evolution of a novel treatment system commonly referred to as unsaturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands 6 18 21 retained wastewater is completely discharged during the drain period the unsaturated media is filled with wastewater during the subsequent feeding cycle 22 sequential wastewater drain and retention protocols passively pump and utilize atmospheric oxygen inside the media respectively 23 such sequential alternative environmental conditions establish the required aerobic anaerobic gradient between electrodes to support higher pollutants removal and bioenergy production in microbial fuel cell based unsaturated tidal flow wetlands 6 partially saturated normal without electrodes tidal flow constructed wetlands have been developed recently for wastewater treatment wastewater retained inside the media is discharged partially from these systems during the drain period to maintain a constant water level in the bottom portion of the media 24 25 the overlying unsaturated media is filled with wastewater during the subsequent feeding cycle the coexistence of overlying unsaturated and underlying saturated media supports aerobic anaerobic pollutants removal kinetics during wastewater feeding retention periods thus improving overall performance 25 the existence of predominant anaerobic conditions in the bottom media of partially saturated tidal flow wetlands could support anaerobic electrochemical organic matter oxidation if microbial fuel cells are incorporated but had not been reported to date regarding operational efficiency the literature review shows higher pollutants removal performances of the microbial fuel cell integrated unsaturated tidal flow constructed wetlands that received either municipal sewage or synthetic wastewater organic nitrogen phosphorus removal percentages ranged between 72 and 100 58 and 86 80 and 100 respectively in electrodes integrated tidal flow systems that received municipal sewage 6 21 with synthetic wastewater based systems organic nitrogen removal percentages ranged between 73 and 98 50 and 85 respectively phosphorus removal was not reported in these studies 18 19 wastewater retention times ranging between 2 and 24 h have been reported for achieving such removal performances moreover wastewater retention time and pollutants removal rates increment were positively correlated in these studies it should be noted that the previously reported studies chose medium organic strength municipal or synthetic wastewater as the influent the adverse impact of higher input organic load on the operational performance of traditionally designed upflow microbial fuel cell based wetlands is documented in the literature 11 26 as such a knowledge gap exists on the pollutants removal performances of recently developed microbial fuel cell based tidal flow wetlands when dosed with wastewater with a more complex chemical composition or high organic strength i e landfill leachate ll wastewater or a mixture of municipal domestic wastewater mw dw leachate i e leachate co treatment 27 28 adverse impact on pollutants removal performance with normal constructed wetlands without electrodes had been reported in the literature when employed for landfill leachate treatment or co treatment with municipal sewage 27 29 high organic strength of such wastewaters and inappropriate wastewater retention time might disrupt the operational performances of the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands and have not been investigated to date media is a critical wetland component that supports chemical and microbial based pollutants removal routes because of inherent chemical composition and surface properties 30 natural organic construction and waste materials were employed as the main media in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands that improved wastewater pollutants removal and bioenergy production 6 21 31 therefore additional studies are required to investigate the influence of media on the operational performances of electrodes integrated tidal flow wetlands when employed for landfill leachate co treatment with municipal sewage in this study unsaturated and partially saturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands were employed for landfill leachate co treatment with municipal sewage that had not been reported to date the experimental systems were packed with different organic palm biochar coconut and waste jhama surkhi tire materials to assess the influence of media in improving pollutants removal performance and bioenergy production two wastewater retention periods i e hydraulic retention time hrt i e 6 and 24 h were employed to identify the correlation between hrt and operational performance variation the main objective of this study was to assess the integrated impact wastewater composition hrt saturation and media variation on common pollutants nitrogen phosphorus and organics removal kinetics and bioenergy production in microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands when employed for landfill leachate co treatment 2 materials and method 2 1 construction of the wetland systems six subsurface flow constructed wetlands namely a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 and a6 were built at the university of asia pacific dhaka bangladesh the constructed wetlands were made of polyvinyl chloride pvc pipes the height and diameter of each constructed wetland were 0 91 and 0 15 m respectively the wetlands were filled with organic materials and waste materials wetland systems a1 a2 and a5 were filled with organic palm fiber biochar and dried green coconut respectively the remaining three wetlands i e a3 a4 and a6 wetland units were filled with waste materials jhama brick brick shurki and rubber tire respectively a brief description of the media along with physical properties i e porosity and size is available in table 1 the media porosity was calculated following the saturation method protocol 21 the operational diagram of the wetland systems is illustrated in fig 1a pictorial plates of the employed media are illustrated in fig 1b the main media achieved 0 82 m depth in each constructed wetland regarding electrode material type carbon or metal based materials were used as electrodes in microbial fuel cell based wetlands 2 32 although carbon based electrodes possess better biocompatibility significant power density production differences were not observed between carbonaceous or metallic electrodes based microbial fuel cell constructed wetlands 32 34 in this study metallic electrodes were selected two aluminium plates 0 1 m 0 1 m were used as cathode and anode electrodes in each constructed wetland these plates were buried in the media of each wetland and placed at a distance of 0 31 m from the top or bottom portion of the main media the distance between the two plates was 0 2 m in each unit the anode and cathode plates of each microbial fuel cell integrated constructed wetland were connected by electrically insulated copper wires a 20 000 ω resistor a multimeter and were separated by a glass wool thermal insulator foam large stones 0 012 m in size on the top and bottom portions of the main media allowed influent distribution and effluent discharge all wetland units were planted with phragmites after plantation the wetlands were waterlogged for 24 weeks to allow plant growth and maturation 2 2 operational protocols the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands received wastewater that was a mixture of landfill leachate ll and municipal wastewater mw commonly referred to as landfill leachate co treatment with sewage the landfill leachate was collected from the matuail landfill site of dhaka city municipal wastewater was collected from a sewage outlet table 2 summarizes the mean chemical composition of the landfill leachate and municipal wastewater the mean ph values demonstrate that the leachate was slightly alkaline whereas the municipal wastewater was slightly acidic the leachate was more anoxic according to the mean redox profiles nitrogen phosphorus organic and solids concentration of the leachate wastewater was substantially higher than municipal wastewater organic biodegradation ratio i e the ratio between bod and cod concentration bod cod of the leachate and municipal wastewater was 0 26 and 0 31 respectively these values show that leachate and municipal wastewater was primarily composed of recalcitrant organic compounds as a ratio 0 5 indicates the presence of biodegradable organic compounds in wastewater 35 the ratio between organic and nitrogen concentration i e cod tn of the leachate and municipal wastewater was 2 22 and 5 67 respectively the experimental design includes three operational periods the volumetric ratio of leachate and municipal wastewater for preparing influent wastewater was 40 ll 60 mw in the first operational period phase i 20 ll 80 mw in the second operational period phase ii 10 ll 90 mw in the third operational period phase iii a gradual decrease of landfill leachate volumetric proportion through effluent recirculation or co treatment with municipal sewage to improve pollutants removal performance employing normal without electrodes integration constructed wetlands has been reported 29 36 the duration of each experimental phase was 6 weeks resulting in 18 weeks of experimental investigation the wetlands were fed with wastewater for 12 weeks before the experimental protocol to achieve removal performance stability the microbial fuel cell integrated constructed wetlands were operated as tidal flow systems that included sequential wastewater fill retention and drain periods within a single dosing cycle per day at the beginning of each dosing cycle wastewater i e the mixture of ll and mw was dosed within 10 min in each wetland that filled the media pore spaces after filling wastewater was retained in each wetland for a pre defined hrt the retained wastewater was drained within 10 min the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands were subjected to two hrts i e 6 h and 24 h during each operational phase the duration of each hrt based operation within a single phase was 3 weeks the selected hrts of this study were almost similar to the previously reported wastewater retention times of the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow unsaturated constructed wetlands that received medium organic strength municipal sewage 21 hrt increment from 8 to 24 h improved pollutants removal rates in such previously reported systems therefore this study would demonstrate the impact of previously reported wastewater retention periods on pollutants removal performance in microbial fuel cell integrated unsaturated partially saturated tidal flow constructed wetlands that received wastewater with higher organic strength the six microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands were operated as unsaturated or partially saturated systems systems a1 a4 functioned as unsaturated systems wastewater was fully drained from such systems after completing the pre defined hrt such repeated dry and wet period cycles allow for the sequential development of aerobic and anoxic anaerobic environments inside the bed matrix thus promoting associated pollutants removal kinetics 22 25 37 systems a5 a6 wetlands operated as partially saturated systems because of partial wastewater discharge that allowed maintaining a constant water level 0 43 m depth in the bottom portion of the media a constant water level develops a predominant anoxic anaerobic environment in the bottom portion of the media and supports associated removal kinetics 25 each unsaturated and partially saturated system received 6 l 340 mm d and 3 l 170 mm d wastewater respectively during a single dosing cycle table 3 illustrates the outflow across the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands within three operational phases 2 3 sample analysis 2 3 1 wastewater quality influent and effluent samples were collected weekly from the six microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow

capacities of the unused fresh and used collected from the six wetlands after completion of the experiment palm fiber biochar dried green coconut jhama brick brick surkhi and rubber tire samples were quantified according to the protocol described by zhu cui 38 in brief synthetic 20 ml ammonium chloride nh4cl of 50 mg l concentration and 20 ml potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 of 50 mg l concentration solutions were prepared such prepared n and p solutions were exposed to 3 g of unused fresh or used media for 48 h the produced supernatant was analyzed for n and p using spectrophotometric methods to measure the media s adsorption capacities 2 3 3 nutrient uptake by plants phragmites plants were harvested from six wetlands at the end of the experimental period for measuring nutrient accumulation the harvested plant biomass was divided into leaf shoots root the divided portions were oven dried at 80 c temperature for four days until the constant dry weight was achieved dried leaves shoots root portions were powdered digestion distillation and vanadomolybdophosphoric yellow color methods were employed for measuring nitrogen and phosphorus contents of the powdered biomass respectively a brief description of the plant nutrient analysis protocol has been described by saeed miah 21 2 3 4 electrochemical parameters the voltage u millivolts mv production across the external resistor r ohms ω of each constructed wetland was measured the current density i milliamperes m3 ma m3 and power density p milliwatts m3 mw m3 production were calculated with

effluent wastewater across the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands during the three operational periods the mean ph concentration of the influent wastewater that was the mixture of leachate and municipal wastewater in different proportions ranged between 7 6 and 8 during phases i iii the mean effluent ph across the microbial fuel cell based wetlands slightly decreased compared to influent profiles ranging between 7 2 and 7 9 during the three operational periods effluent ph values across all microbial fuel cell based wetlands of 24 h wastewater hrt exceeded those of 6 h hrt during phase i phase iii period showed the opposite trend effluent ph concentration of 6 h hrt exceeded those of 24 h hrt in the intermediate operational period phase ii a mixed trend i e higher or lower effluent ph during 24 h hrt compared to preceding 6 h hrt profiles was observed wastewater ph changes in constructed wetlands depend on fatty acid production alkalinity consumption and generation because of anaerobic organic degradation nitrification and denitrification respectively 39 40 redox profile is a critical parameter in microbial fuel cell based wetlands as it indicates the environmental conditions of the bed matrix to support pollutants removal and bioenergy production the mean influent redox profile eh was anoxic anaerobic in nature that ranged between 75 3 and 39 mv within phases i iii fig 2 the mean effluent redox profiles produced across the microbial fuel cell based tidal wetland systems during phase i were more anoxic anaerobic in nature compared to influent profiles the mean effluent redox profiles ranged between 125 and 29 mv during the first operation period phase i the redox profiles of the effluent samples produced during the longer hrt i e 24 h were more anoxic or anaerobic in nature than those of 6 h hrt in phase i fig 2 constructed wetlands receive oxygen because of atmospheric diffusion and plant root based leakage 7 complete media saturation for a longer period in phase i decreased atmospheric oxygen diffusion in the media that could not be counterbalanced by plant based oxygen leakage because of higher influent organic strength and associated available oxygen consumption by different pollutants removal kinetics during the last two operational periods ii and iii the effluent redox profiles across the wetland systems were less anoxic in nature compared to corresponding profiles of the first operational period the mean redox profiles of the effluent samples ranged between 5 and 83 mv 58 and 119 mv during phases ii iii respectively influent organic and inorganic pollutants strength decreased within the last two phases due to volumetric proportion reduction of the leachate in the mixed wastewater discussed in sections 3 3 3 4 such strength reduction could have increased effluent redox potentials during the last two phases compared to the first phase as organic matter is often oxidized in the presence of an electron acceptor i e oxygen 2 14 3 2 role of wetland components on pollutants removal plant and media wetland plants contribute to wastewater nutrient n and p removal through uptake kinetics 41 table 4 summarizes plant biomass weight kg n and p accumulation g kg in aboveground shoot leaf and underground root portions of phragmites planted into the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands as observed in table 4 nutrient accumulation g kg in the aboveground portion exceeded the underground portion n p accumulation percentage in aboveground or underground plant tissue was low i e 2 and 2 4 respectively with respect to total removal based on influent effluent analysis low nutrient uptake of wetland plants had also been reported with normal without electrodes constructed wetlands 36 due to substantial input loading that exceeded the uptake capacity of plants 24 therefore other removal routes could also have influenced the nutrient removal in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands and will be discussed in the following sections cation exchange sites on wetland media surfaces promote wastewater nh4 n adsorption whereas ca al fe components of the wetland media surfaces trigger wastewater p adsorption 42 43 to identify whether such kinetics influenced wastewater nutrient removal in this study nutrient adsorption capacity of the unused used organic and waste materials employed as the main media in the microbial fuel cell tidal flow constructed wetlands was assessed according to the protocol described in section 2 3 results are summarized in fig 3 as observed in fig 3 initial nh4 n 50 mg l and p 50 mg l concentration of the nh4cl and kh2po4 solutions decreased when exposed to unused and used organic waste materials such concentration decrease confirms nh4 n and p adsorption capacities of the employed media the nutrient adsorption capacity of the unused used organic waste materials was further investigated through energy dispersive spectroscopy eds analysis that quantified the elemental composition of the employed materials supplementary material s1 according to the eds analysis elemental n percentages were high in most used media compared to unused samples the presence of specific cations i e calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 potassium k and sodium na influence nh4 n adsorption in media 44 in this study elemental percentage changes of such cations between unused and used media were observed supplementary material s1 therefore cation exchange dependent nh4 n removal could have occurred in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands 43 it should be noted that wastewater nh4 n sinking into the media is a temporal removal route the bounded or wastewater nh4 n could be subjected to microbial decomposition 45 which will be discussed in section 3 4 media based adsorption influences p removal in constructed wetlands through ligand and ion exchanges specific media composed of calcium ca aluminium al and iron fe reinforces such adsorption in constructed wetlands 42 46 these elements were present in unused and the used media employed in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands supplementary material s1 therefore media based p adsorption could have existed in the wetland systems of this study and will be discussed in section 3 5 3 3 organic matter removal influent effluent organic bod and cod concentration profiles and corresponding removal percentages of the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands within the three operational periods are presented in figs 4 and 5 the mean bod cod removal percentages within the experimental systems ranged between 35 and 76 22 and 76 respectively within phases i iii the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands achieved low organic removal percentages during both hrts i e 6 and 24 h of phase i period when leachate proportion was higher in the mixed wastewater higher influent cod concentration i e 1536 mg l in phase i could significantly influence such observed performance wang tian 12 reported that higher cod concentration 1000 mg l of wastewater disrupts electrochemically organic decomposition in anode zone such inhibition results in cod accumulation around the cathode in conjunction with predominant anaerobic environment development inside the media of microbial fuel cell based constructed wetlands similar phenomena could have also occurred in microbial fuel cell tidal flow wetland systems of this study thus disrupting the aerobic anoxic anaerobic gradient between the electrodes 2 and diminishing overall cod removal performances during both hrts of phase i the effluent samples produced across all microbial fuel cell based tidal flow wetlands during 24 h hrt of phase i fig 2 were more anoxic in nature compared to those of the preceding 6 h hrt bod or cod removal also decreased in the experimental wetland systems during 24 h hrt of phase i compared to those of the preceding 6 h hrt figs 4 and 5 the combination of higher wastewater organic strength and longer hrt triggered the development of anoxic anaerobic environment inside bed matrix such environmental conditions disrupted the required redox gradient between the electrodes and reduced electrochemical based organic oxidation in anode compartment 2 although longer hrt improved organic removal performance in microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands 18 this study shows opposite phenomena primarily because of influent organic strength variation on the other hand a decrease in leachate volume proportion within the last two phases reduced the organic strength 522 mg l cod of the influent leachate municipal mixed wastewater fig 5 influent organic strength decrease during the last two phases supported electrochemically organic removal and prevented cod accumulation around the cathode these factors established the required aerobic anaerobic gradient between the electrodes and improved electrochemical based organic removal figs 4 and 5 in the wetland systems of this study 6 8 positive increment of effluent redox values during the last two phases fig 2 also supports such hypothesis regardless of performance improvement the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow wetlands in this study achieved lower cod removal during the last two phases fig 5 compared to cod removal profiles 97 9 of an electrode integrated tidal flow wetland system dosed with artificial wastewater 19 cod concentration of the reported artificial wastewater i e 514 mg l coincided with the influent wastewater profiles during the last two phases fig 5 reported in this study the wetland systems of this study received real wastewater that might have caused performance disparity because of more complex chemical composition of real wastewater on the other hand cod removal of the experimental systems during the last two phases when leachate volumetric proportion decreased was higher than that i e 10 to 17 of a gravel media packed normal without electrodes vertical flow wetland that received real landfill leachate 29 decrease of leachate volumetric proportion through leachate co treatment produced such reported organic removal performances therefore electrodes integration might favor organic removal from real wastewater because of electrochemical based organic oxidation in tidal flow constructed wetlands under suitable influent organic concentration as observed in this study 3 4 nitrogen removal influent effluent nh4 n concentration profiles and corresponding removal percentages of the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands within the three operational periods are presented in fig 6 the mean nh4 n removal percentages of the experimental systems ranged between 10 and 90 within phases i iii nh4 n removal in constructed wetlands is often achieved through aerobic microbial nitrification 24 25 47 therefore anaerobic conditions development inside the media of the experimental wetlands reduced overall nh4 n removal performance in phase i fig 6 that was counterbalanced by aerobic gradient development as indicated by effluent redox profiles fig 2 during the latter two phases however the 24 h hrt in phase i resulted in comparatively better nh4 n removal than the preceding 6 h phase in the wetland systems of this study such phenomena were not observed in terms of organic removal due to adverse environmental conditions longer wastewater retention time favored other nh4 n removal routes i e plant uptake table 4 media based adsorption fig 3 and supplementary material s1 along nitrification 48 better nh4 n removal was continued in all wetland systems during 24 h hrt of the latter two phases that coincided with organic removal pattern and effluent redox profiles increment substantial nh4 n removal improvement in all wetland systems during 24 h hrt of the last two phases when environmental conditions were less anoxic suggests that microbial nitrification was the dominant nh4 n removal mechanism in this study it should be noted that organic and nh4 n removal performance in the partially saturated systems a5 and a6 was severely influenced during both hrts of phase i hrt increment from 6 to 24 h during phase i increased effluent bod concentration over influent values partially saturated media longer wastewater hrt i e 24 h and high influent organic strength could have been the contributing factors however decreased influent organic strength because of leachate proportion reduction in the mixed wastewater substantially improved the organic and nh4 n removal performance in the partially saturated wetlands during the last two operational periods these results suggest that partially saturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands should not be designed to treat wastewater with substantial organic strength the mean influent no2 n and no3 n concentration across the wetland systems was 0 06 and 6 3 mg l respectively within the three operational periods no2 n no3 n mean effluent concentration across the wetland systems ranged between 0 03 and 0 2 mg l 4 8 and 8 8 mg l respectively effluent no2 n concentration increase or decrease was quantified no3 n removal percentage ranged between 13 and 24 within the three operational phases fig 7 presents influent effluent tn concentration profiles and associated removal percentages the mean tn removal percentages ranged between 7 and 69 within phases i iii tn removal percentages in all wetland systems were higher during the latter two phases than in phase i no3 n and tn removals in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands indicate the influence of classical denitrification such kinetics heavily depends upon nitrification rates and organic carbon c availability 6 19 48 higher nitrification rates produced more no3 n for denitrification during the latter two phases the other factor i e c availability is often assessed through wastewater cod tn ratio a ratio ranging between 3 and 9 supports denitrification kinetics in constructed wetlands 12 49 the mean influent wastewater cod tn ratio was 3 2 3 4 and 5 9 in phases i ii and iii respectively influent cod tn ratio and tn removal percentage of the wetland systems increment were positively correlated decreased leachate volumetric proportion in the mixed leachate municipal wastewater improved the overall cod tn ratio that favored denitrification based tn removal in the microbial fuel cell tidal flow wetland systems during the last two phases wastewater retention time dependent 6 vs 24 h of a single phase analysis showed better tn removal in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands during the 6 h hrt of phase i or ii fig 7 such a trend could be attributed to c consumption competition between the electrogenic and denitrifying microbial population 6 50 that could have been intensified under a longer hrt i e 24 h of phases i ii thus resulting in tn removal decrease however an opposite trend was observed during the last phase the 24 h hrt of the last phase resulted in better tn removal the maximum influent cod tn ratio i e 5 9 was quantified during the last phase that supported the metabolism of both microbial populations during a longer hrt overall tn removal performance in microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow wetlands during the last phase is comparable with that 67 tn removal of a pilot scale normal without electrodes integration tidal flow wetlands that received anaerobically digested wastewater 51 the cod 565 mg l and tn 169 mg l concentration of the reported digested wastewater coincided with the concentration profiles of leachate municipal sewage mixed wastewater employed in this study during phase iii figs 5 and 7 as such the results of this study support the potential application of microbial cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands to achieve satisfactory nitrogen removal from real wastewater depending on organic composition and biodegradability 3 5 media based removal performance regarding organic removal performances of the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands with respect to the employed media organic palm fiber biochar green coconut media based unsaturated and partially saturated systems achieved a mean 35 to 64 and 13 to 60 organic removal percentages respectively throughout the experimental campaign waste media jhama surkhi rubber tire based unsaturated and partially saturated systems achieved a mean of 7 to 62 and 4 to 66 organic removal percentages respectively regarding tn removal performance organic media based unsaturated and partially saturated systems achieved a mean of 33 to 69 and 30 to 68 nitrogen removal percentages respectively waste media based unsaturated and partially saturated systems achieved a mean of 25 to 60 and 7 to 69 nitrogen removal percentages respectively upper removal percentages were observed during the latter two operational phases when operational conditions were more favorable for supporting pollutants removal these results also suggest that although organic media based wetland systems were more efficient under adverse conditions i e when influent organic concentration was high removal performance within the two materials based systems was almost similar under more favorable conditions i e when influent organic concentration reduced the c composition of the employed media influences denitrification in constructed wetland systems 52 the unused organic palm biochar coconut materials were composed of c in substantial percentages as illustrated by the eds analysis supplementary material s1 such a composition of the organic materials could have supplied c to the denitrifiers and assisted in achieving better tn removal in the corresponding microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands 39 53 compared to waste material based systems during the three phases the positive impact of organic materials as wetland media in supplying c and supporting denitrification had also been reported with tidal flow based normal without electrodes constructed wetlands 25 54 although c content of the media provided an additional advantage to support tn removal in organic media based wetlands the removal performances of the waste material based wetlands more specifically those of the tire packed system during the latter two operational periods should not be overruled fig 7 the pictorial plates of the unused rubber tire samples indicate the presence of micropores on media surface areas fig 1b whereas thick layer formation was observed on the surface of used tire samples supplementary material s2 as such the physical properties of tire media might have produced ideal conditions to support the growth of diverse biofilm 31 moreover the presence of a higher c percentage proportion of the unused tire samples supplementary material s1 could have triggered the metabolism of the denitrifiers probably in the deeper portion of the formed biofilm on the tire media surface 6 in addition the partially saturated wetlands packed with either organic coconut or waste tire material removed tn that was comparable to organic palm biochar or waste jhama surkhi materials packed unsaturated systems within the last two phases therefore partially saturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands could also be employed for wastewater treatment depending on wastewater composition influent effluent overall tp concentration and associated removal percentages during each of the three operational phases of the wetland systems are presented in fig 8 tp removal percentages ranged between 47 and 89 within phases i iii the removal percentage in all wetland systems was higher during the latter two phases the 24 h hrt of such phases was more efficient in removing influent tp removal plant uptake and media based adsorption kinetics influence tp removal in subsurface flow constructed wetlands 42 46 in this study the tp accumulation percentage of the phragmites plants was not substantial table 4 with respect to overall influent effluent based removal adsorption capacity analysis fig 4 shows the existence of a media based tp adsorption route that achieved comparatively better tp removal performances in all wetland systems primarily because of the presence of ca al fe elements supplementary material s1 42 throughout the experimental campaign the mean p removal percentage of the organic waste media based wetlands ranged between 47 and 79 48 and 89 respectively these results specify higher p adsorption capacities of the employed waste materials particularly when influent tp concentration decreased during the last two phases that additionally increased adsorption capacities longer hrt further improved adsorption kinetics the overall p removal percentage in organic waste media based electrodes integrated tidal flow wetlands coincided with previously reported p removal that ranged between 46 and 90 employing waste alum sludge packed microbial fuel cell based wetlands 8 10 therefore the organic and waste materials reported in this study might be used as the main media in constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment 3 6 electrochemical parameters 3 6 1 voltage production and polarization curves fig 9 summarizes mean voltage production mv across the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands with respect to time measured between 10 min after hydraulic loading and 10 min before wastewater discharge within a single dosing cycle according to fig 9 jhama based a3 system achieved the highest overall mean voltage production i e 152 mv within a single dosing cycle during 6 h hrt of phase i waste tire based a6 system achieved the highest mean voltage production ranging between 23 and 124 mv during 24 h hrt of phase i and both hrts of the latter two operational phases other waste jhama a3 surkhi a4 organic material based wetlands palm a1 biochar a2 coconut a5 systems achieved similar mean voltage production within such periods mean voltage production ranged between 10 and 42 mv 4 and 45 mv respectively throughout the experimental campaign the mean power density production within the six microbial fuel cell based tidal flow wetlands ranged between 1 and 64 mw m3 the tire material packed system achieved the highest power density production a few research studies also reported power density production differences among microbial fuel cell integrated wetlands because of media variation yakar türe 31 reported power density production ranging between 5 and 27 mw m2 within the sand zeolite volcanic cinder packed upflow microbial fuel cell integrated wetlands saeed and jihad miah 6 reported power density production ranging between 8 and 352 mw m2 employing tidal flow based microbial fuel cell integrated wetlands filled with organic construction and waste materials physical properties of the media such as porosity rough textures allow substantial microbial population attachment on media surfaces improving electrochemical based organic oxidation and bioenergy production 31 the scanning electron microscope sem images indicate differences in surface structure between unused organic and waste materials employed as the main media in this study supplementary material s2 the used samples represented different characteristics more void spaces were observed on the surface areas of the used biochar primarily because of microbial degradation 6 thick solid layers were formed on the surface areas of other used samples particularly on used tire samples surface probably because of solid root fragments deposition and microbial film formation 55 that supported electrochemical based kinetics the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands were connected to the external resistors ranging between 100 and 27 000 ω for measuring current production losses that might have occurred inside the systems throughout the three operational phases such protocol is referred to as polarization test the mean results of the polarization test obtained from three phases i e current density power density voltage production are presented in fig 10 according to the polarization curves the maximum power density production was 50 157 182 186 155 527 mw m3 across the a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 and a6 systems respectively when connected to 1000 ω external resistor the current density was the lowest when voltage was maximum and agreed with the previously reported trend 15 three loss patterns such as the initial sharp voltage drop activation loss mid stage slow voltage drop ohmic loss and last stage fast voltage drop under high current intensities concentration loss were observed in the polarization curve the polarization curves of other studies also demonstrated similar trends 3 56 these losses occur because of poor organic matter degradation kinetics ohmic resistance development and organic c depletion in the anode zone respectively 14 the polarization curves also indicate that the major current losses in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands of this study were due to ohmic loss 15 the partially saturated tire media based system a6 produced the highest maximum power density 527 mw m3 that exceeded the maximum power density production 50 to 186 mw m3 of other systems in this study in addition the tire based system s maximum power density production was substantially higher than those i e 16 to 214 mw m3 of the reported microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow wetlands 18 19 partial saturation was not the primary factor that caused higher power density production across the tire media based system a6 as the other organic media dried coconut based partially saturated system a5 achieved low maximum power density production 155 mw m3 than the partially saturated tire based system moreover the unsaturated biochar a2 jhama brick a3 and surkhi a4 media packed systems achieved maximum power density production ranging between 157 and 186 mw m3 that was beyond that of partially saturated coconut material packed system a5 but beneath that of partially saturated tire packed system a6 therefore within the two variables i e saturation and media differences among the six microbial fuel cell wetlands the latter factor i e media influenced bioenergy production due to chemical such as carbon composition supplementary material s1 and physical rough surfaces voids supplementary material s2 properties variation of the media 6 31 it should be noted that the experimental wetlands of this study particularly the tire media packed system achieved substantial power density production despite a low surface area of the employed metallic aluminium anode electrode therefore such metallic material might be used as an anode electrode in microbial fuel cell based constructed wetlands that were also reported in previous studies low cost easy availability of the employed material could reduce operational expenses 21 57 3 6 2 ce and ner the operational efficiencies of the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands had been investigated through coulombic efficiency ce and net energy recovery ner 4 the calculated values employing eqs 1 and 2 are presented in fig 11 that represents scattered plots between influent cod vs ce and ce vs ner a sharp ce percentage decrease in all systems was observed when influent cod concentration increased between 0 and 700 mg l ranges fig 11a similar phenomena were previously reported 8 such a trend confirms that electrogenic microbial metabolic activities and associated electron production performance in the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands were severely hindered by high influent cod concentration and justified by comparatively overall low organic removal performances during the phase i period it should be noted that ce values might not depict the actual performance of the microbial fuel cell because of the substrate electron consumption by electrochemically inactive microbial population and circuit bypassing of the generated electron 7 58 therefore ner values were also calculated and plotted against ce percentage values as presented in fig 11b according to the scattered plots ner and ce values increment were interdependent for all microbial fuel cell based systems this trend also confirms the operational performance decrease of the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow wetlands when subjected to high influent cod loading 4 conclusions organic nitrogen and phosphorus removal percentage ranged between 22 and 62 0 2 and 56 47 and 60 respectively within the unsaturated and partially saturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow wetlands when the volumetric proportion of the leachate was high 40 ll 60 mw such removal performance improved ranging between 38 and 76 24 and 84 60 and 89 respectively when the co treatment ratio of the leachate decreased i e 20 ll 80 mw and 10 ll 90 mw a higher volumetric proportion of landfill leachate increased influent pollutants strength that did not favor electrochemically active inactive pollutants removal routes more specifically during longer wastewater retention period i e 24 h the combination of influent pollutants strength reduction due to volumetric proportion reduction of the leachate and a longer wastewater retention period improved overall removal performance in the wetland systems of this study nitrification denitrification and media based adsorption controlled nitrogen and phosphorus removals respectively the waste tire based system achieved maximum power density production 527 mw m3 that exceeded the maximum power density production 50 to 186 mw m3 across other organic and waste material packed systems physicochemical properties variation of the media influenced power density production in general this study identifies

13152,the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of fe2 on the nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox under the inhibition of organic matter in the experiment the influent c n was controlled at about 2 25 by synthetic water and the up flow anammox reactor was run at 0 15 1 5 3 0 and 4 5 mg l fe2 respectively the number of denitrifying bacteria and the characteristics of microbial community in the reactor were analyzed by most probably number method and high throughput sequencing method the results show that when the influent c n and fe2 are controlled at 2 25 and 0 15 mg l respectively the tn removal efficiency can reach 82 15 when fe2 concentration increased to 1 5 3 0 and 4 5 mg l tn removal efficiency increased by 4 00 6 89 and 7 77 respectively in terms of microbes the abundance of denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria increased collectively with the addition of fe2 when the fe2 increased from 0 15 mg l to 3 mg l the number of denitrifying bacteria in the bottom and middle of the reactor increased from 1 62 108 and 2 74 107 to 8 06 108 and 3 76 107 respectively in the middle of the reactor the abundance of planctomycetota and candidatus jettenia with anammox function increased from 4 01 and 2 18 to 4 87 and 3 17 respectively therefore appropriate fe2 addition can promote the growth of denitrifying functional bacteria and anammox bacteria in the anammox reactor inhibited by organic matter thus improving the denitrification efficiency of the reactor it can provide a reference value for the anammox reactor to treat actual municipal wastewater containing organic matter keywords anammox fe2 organic matter nitrogen removal microbial abundance 1 introduction anammox is a new technology with low energy consumption and strong nitrogen removal ability in biological treatment 1 2 it has the advantages of no additional carbon source for nitrogen removal low sludge production and high efficiency for nitrogen removal 3 many studies show that anammox has been successfully applied to the industrial treatment of high ammonium wastewater 4 5 nowadays many scholars have begun to research the treatment of actual sewage by anammox 6 7 in reality the actual sewage often exists in various kinds of organic matter with different concentrations and denitrifying bacteria could use organic matter to remove no3 n generated by anammox reaction while the concentration of organic matter is low 8 9 however if the concentration of organic matter is too high denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria will compete with substrate no2 n thus affecting the anammox reaction 10 11 pijuan m et al studied the influence of cod on anammox reactor under short term and long term conditions and they found that short term cod addition did not increase the concentration of ammonia nitrogen so it did not affect anammox activity however long term addition of cod will reduce the activity of anammox and cause the transfer of microbial community which will lead to the reduction of anammox fraction 12 winkler et al found that anammox bacteria could better compete with heterotrophic denitrification bacteria and anammox bacteria could make use of organic matter in sewage to lower the effluent nitrate concentration and improve the denitrification effect of the reactor while the c n ratio of influent water was less than 0 5 13 therefore how to improve the nitrogen removal efficiency nre of organic wastewater is one of the key points of anammox research the most abundant transition metal in biological systems is iron and fe2 is one of the most abundant metals in wastewater 14 15 fe2 is readily available cheap and more effective in precipitation pollution control phosphorus and antibiotic removal in sewage treatment plants 16 in anammox fe2 is incorporated into protein cofactors and serves either catalytic redox or regulatory purposes anammox bacteria rely heavily on iron containing proteins especially cytochromes for their energy conservation which occurs within a unique organelle the anammoxosome 17 fe2 is both a microelement required for microbial growth and one of the essential elements for the synthesis of heme c which is involved in the metabolic process of anammox as an important cofactor 18 19 therefore it is speculated that adding fe2 may improve the of the anammox reactor yang et al found that under the impetus of fe2 fe3 cycle iron can act as a catalyst to trigger the reaction between nh4 n and no3 n and simultaneously remove nitrate and ammonium salt providing an efficient economic and new denitrification method for the treatment of wastewater containing high nitrogen 20 liu et al found that there was a linear correlation between the amount of fe2 incorporation and the removal efficiency of nh4 n in the single stage nitrogen removal process when fe2 and fe3 concentrations were lower than 1 3 mg l and 0 4 mg l respectively excessive fe2 and fe3 can reduce sludge activity sludge concentration and the number of functional microbial communities 21 in terms of microbes lara sindhu et al studied the effect of fe2 on the anammox system and found that the addition of fe2 increased the abundance of candidatus brocadia fe2 oxidation activated central metabolism by upregulation of key functional genes hdh and hao of anammox bacteria meanwhile extracellular polymer eps content was also increased leading to rapid improvement of the anammox system 22 the fe2 could serve as electron donor for the anammox genera kuenenia stuttgartiensis coupled with the nitrate reduction to nitrite 23 s qiao et al found that appropriate increase of fe2 could be conductive to accumulation of fe element inside anammox cell which was further beneficial for heme c synthesis improvement of crude hdh activity and the growth of anammox biomass 24 from the research of scholars it is not difficult to find that fe2 plays a positive role in anammox and appropriate fe2 addition can participate in the metabolic process of anammox and enhance the activity of anammox bacteria however until today although a large number of studies have been conducted on the effect of fe2 on anammox there are few reports on whether fe2 can improve the nre of anammox under the condition of organic inhibition in summary the main aims of this study include 1 effect of fe2 addition on the nre of anammox reactor under the condition of organic matter inhibition 2 characteristics of the microbial community in anammox reactor with fe2 addition under the condition of organic matter inhibition 3 discussion about the effect of fe2 on nitrogen conversion in the anammox reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and operation an up flow anaerobic coupled biofilm reactor with an effective volume of 6 28 l which adopts a peristaltic pump to continuously feed water with a daily inflow of 38 l and a hydraulic retention time of 4 h was constructed fig 1 the bottom of the reactor was laid with a 10 cm pebble layer and the middle of the reactor was filled with 1 cm 1 cm 1 cm polyurethane porous carriers accounting for 47 of the volume at the top of the reactor is a three phase separator the reactor was cultured in a thermostatic chamber without light and the water temperature was controlled at 30 32 c by an indoor temperature control system 2 2 inoculate sludge and synthetic water reactor inoculation sludge was collected from an a2 o anaerobic anoxic oxic process sewage treatment plant in lanzhou and the amount of sludge was controlled at 5 l wastewater was synthesized with a composition of sucrose 37 5 mg l nh4cl 157 5 mg l and nano2 262 5 mg l et al and all of experimental drugs were analytical pure in order to create the conditions of anammox under the inhibition of organic matter the c n of influent was 2 25 which originated from the research group s previous research section 3 1 and other people s research 25 26 the stoichiometry of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n to nitrite nitrogen no2 n in synthetic water was 1 1 32 and the concentrations were 39 04 40 91 mg l and 51 22 54 07 mg l respectively the fe2 concentration was controlled by feso4 7h2o at 0 15 1 5 3 5 4 5 mg l in four stages respectively and the influent ph range was 7 4 7 7 other compositions of the synthetic wastewater are listed as follow 20 mg l kh2po4 20 mg l cacl2 20 mg l mgso4 7h20 1 ml l

through 0 45 μm filter paper and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c before analysis the concentration of fe2 was determined by the 1 10 phenanthroline standard method the cod concentration was determined using a cod tester hach dr5000 the tn nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were determined using normative methods 27 2 4 most probably number method the denitrifying bacteria in the reactor were counted by mpn most probably number method 28 in this study denitrifying bacteria in the middle and bottom of anammox reactor with different fe2 concentrations under organic matter inhibition were tested by a series of gradient dilution culture and color detection to find out the corresponding number of possible bacteria according to the number of color tube in the test about 10 g of the packing with biofilm was taken and stirred in buffer solution or sterile water for 30 min and the mixture of bacteria and water was diluted for culture 2 5 microbial community analysis when the fe2 concentration was 0 15 mg l and 3 0 mg l the biofilms on the filler surface at 40 cm from bottom to top in the reactor were taken as samples which were named fe1 40 and fe3 40 respectively the two samples were explored by illumina miseq sequencing to determine the microbial community structure samples were sent to majorbio company shanghai china the universal primer pair 338 f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806 r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 was utilized for amplification and sequencing of the 16 s rrna gene v3 v4 region all data analyses were finished by i sanger cloud platform www i sanger com sequencing reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at an identity threshold of 0 97 the functional genes were established using picrust2 function prediction 29 30 31 152 reads were obtained from each sample after subsampling and the coverage was greater than 99 6 indicating that the diversity of the microbial community could be well 3 results and analysis anammox reactor used in this experiment has been operating stably for one year the hydraulic load was 2 4 m3 m2 day and the influent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and cod were 40 53 and 90 mg l respectively the experiments were divided into four different phases to investigate the effect of fe2 on the nitrogen removal of anammox biofilm reactor under the condition of organic inhibition which is based on fe2 concentrations phase i 0 15 day 0 15 mg l phase ii 16 30 day 1 5 mg l phase iii 31 45 day 3 mg l phase iv 46 60 day 4 5 mg l 3 1 influence of organics on nre of anammox before this experiment we have investigated the nre of the anammox reactor under the condition of different c n to explore the c n which form an inhibition on anammox fig 2 the experiment was divided into four stages 0 0 75 1 5 and 2 25 of c n for a total of 60 days the stoichiometry of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n to nitrite nitrogen no2 n in water was controlled at 1 1 32 and the concentrations were 39 04 40 91 mg l and 51 22 54 07 mg l respectively the influent cod prepared by sucrose were 0 29 10 31 50 59 05 63 00 88 15 93 20 mg l respectively the influent ph range was 7 4 7 7 and the addition amount of trace elements was 2 ml l 1 31 when c n was 0 the effluent was mainly no3 n with an average concentration of 22 5 mg l and the nre was 83 49 fig 2a b with the increase of c n to 0 75 and 1 5 no3 n concentration in effluent decreased to 15 2 mg l and 9 7 mg l respectively and nre increased by 6 36 and 11 5 respectively when the c n ratio further increased to 2 25 the nre decreased to 82 21 and the effluent nh4 n and no3 n increased to 15 1 mg l and 24 3 mg l respectively these results indicate that appropriate organic matter addition can enhance the nre of anammox reactor but high concentration will cause the inhibition this is consistent with the results of guo m et al 32 the addition of a small amount of organic matter provided nutrients for heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria without inhibiting the anammox reaction and promotes the growth of denitrifying bacteria microorganisms enabling them to remove no3 n through denitrification chen c et al found that when the feeding cod concentration was lower than 99 7 mg l in an anaerobic baffled reactor abr anammox reactor nitrogen removal could be enhanced via the coexistence of denitrification and anammox which is similar to the conclusion of this experiment 33 however under a high concentration of organic matter denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria compete in the biofilm which inhibits the growth of anammox bacteria and is not conducive to anammox nitrogen removal thus making the denitrification performance of the reactor poor chen c found that 150 and 200 mg l of cod caused the disintegration of anammox granular sludge while also reducing extracellular polymeric substances eps content mechanical strength and sedimentation performance respectively 34 in view of the inhibition of organic matter on the denitrification performance of anammox reactor this experiment further investigated whether the addition of fe2 can improve the denitrification performance of the reactor again 3 2 influence of fe2 on nre of anammox when the anammox function returned to normal and stable operation for 3 months after adding synthetic wastewater without organic matter to the same anammox reactor sucrose was added into the water again to control the c n at 2 25 so as to investigate the effect of fe2 on the nre of anammox under the inhibition of organic matter with the increase of fe2 concentration the no2 n removal efficiency was always higher than 95 fig 3 a the result indicates that fe2 has no significant effect on the removal efficiency of no2 n in the reactor which may be due to the fact that no2 n as a common substrate of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria is completely removed in the competition between them in phase i 0 15 day 0 15 mg l the average effluent concentration of nh4 n is 12 63 mg l and the average removal efficiency of nh4 n was 67 98 it is speculated that organic matter hurts the activity of anammox bacteria and the main way of nitrogen removal is denitrification denitrifying bacteria grew at a faster rate anammox bacteria were at a disadvantage when competing with denitrifying bacteria for living space and substrate meanwhile the consumption of h in the denitrification process leads to the increase of ph of the system which further inhibits the growth of anammox bacteria resulting in a poor removal effect of nh4 n in the reactor 35 36 in phase ii 16 30 day 1 5 mg l and phase iii 31 45 day 3 mg l with the increase of fe2 concentration the average effluent concentration of nh4 n decreased to 9 04 mg l and 7 13 mg l and the average removal efficiency of nh4 n increased by 9 31 and 13 9 compared with phase i respectively the increase of nh4 n removal efficiency was no longer obvious and stabilized at about 83 64 during phase iv it can be speculated that a small amount of fe2 can promote the removal effect of nh4 n in the 0anammox reactor which is under the inhibition of organic matter as shown in fig 3b the average concentration of no3 n in the reactor effluent fluctuates between 1 06 and 2 44 mg l and fe2 had no obvious influence on the no3 n removal effect fe2 promoted the growth of anammox bacteria enhanced the nre of anammox and weakened the competition of denitrifying bacteria on no2 n under the condition of high influent cod denitrifying bacteria have limited available substrate which made denitrifying bacteria use no3 n to denitrification and remove it thoroughly the average nre of phase i was 82 15 indicating that the nre of the reactor was inhibited by c n of 2 25 the nre of phase ii and phase iii continued to rise due to the reduction of effluent nh4 n concentration which was 4 and 6 89 higher than that of phase i respectively in phase iv fe2 was 4 5 mg l the nre remained at 89 92 at this point anammox played a leading role and denitrifying bacteria degraded the nitrate produced by the anammox reaction and improve nre in conclusion under the condition of organic matter inhibition appropriate fe2 addition can effectively enhance the nre of anammox biofilm reactor 3 3 influence of fe2 on the number of denitrifying bacteria the number of denitrifying bacteria in biofilm was counted by the mpn method as shown in table 1 according to the data in the table the number of denitrifying bacteria in the bottom part of the reactor increased by an order of magnitude compared with that in the middle part under different fe2 concentrations the main reason was that the device was an up flow column reactor and most of the organic matter accumulated at the bottom of the reactor under the action of gravity thus promoting the growth of denitrifying bacteria with the increase of fe2 concentration from 0 15 mg l to 3 mg l the number of denitrifying bacteria in the bottom and middle increased from 1 62 108 and 2 74 107 to 8 06 108 and 3 76 107 respectively therefore it can be inferred that the addition of fe2 can enhance the activity of denitrifying bacteria in the anammox reactor under the inhibition of organic matter 3 4 effect of fe2 on microbial community in anammox reactor 3 4 1 diversity of bacterial community in anammox reactor in this study high throughput sequencing was used to analyze the microbial community in the middle of the reactor at two kinds of fe2 concentrations under the organic matter inhibition the credibility of this sequencing was ensured by the good coverage table 2 and the flattening rarefaction curve fig 4 37 the microbial diversity index of the two samples is shown in table 2 and the library coverage efficiency of each sample is quite close to 1 00 from the table with the increase of fe2 concentration ace simpsom and chao indices were all increased while shannon index gradually was decreased ace and chao indexes were richness indices which were positively correlated with the richness of microbial species simpson was negatively correlated with the diversity of microbial communities 38 39 therefore it can be speculated that the addition of fe2 under organic matter inhibition decreased slightly the number of microbial species but enriched the community in the reactor 3 4 2 microbial community composition of anammox reactor analyzed by phylum level fig 5 the main dominant phyla in both samples were proteobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes and planctomycetota the planctomycetota are anammox functional bacterium and its abundance can reflect whether the anammox reaction in the reactor is inhibited to a certain extent 40 41 when the fe2 concentration was controlled at 3 0 mg l the abundance of planctomycetota was 4 87 which increased by 0 86 compared with 0 15 mg l firmicutes could decompose organic matter and improve the ability of the microbial community to resistance against toxic substances 42 in anammox reactor the abundance of firmicutes increased from 7 80 to 10 69 with the increase of fe2 concentration hence under the condition of 3 mg l fe2 and organic matter inhibition the anammox bacteria in the middle part was relatively active and the competitive advantage of heterotrophic microorganisms has been reduced due to the decomposition of organic matter at this time the synergistic effect of anammox and denitrifying bacteria improved the nre of the reactor in anammox reactor many microorganisms in proteobacteria have the function of denitrification using organic carbon sources 43 45 when fe2 concentration was controlled at 0 15 mg l and 3 0 mg l the proteobacteria abundance was 31 81 and 29 01 respectively the decrease of proteobacteria abundance was mainly due to the enhancement of anammox activity and degradation of organic matter chlorobacteria can hydrolyze organic matter and participate in biofilm formation under anaerobic conditions compared with 0 15 mg l fe2 the abundance of chlorobacteria at 3 0 mg l decreased by 1 32 which increased the abundance of the planctomycetota due to the increase of available inorganic carbon sources and improved the activity of the anammox fig 6 shows that candidatus jettenia and candidatus brocadia are the anammox bacteria with high abundance in the reactor at the genus classification level 46 47 when the fe2 concentration increased from 0 15 mg l to 3 0 mg l the abundance of candidatus jettenia increased from 2 18 to 3 07 while the abundance of candidatus brocadia decreased from 1 72 to 0 82 according to the nre of the reactor and the number of otu567 it can be inferred that increasing the fe2 concentration can improve the activity and growth rate of candidatus jettenia and increase the abundance of anammox bacteria so that the anammox bacteria gradually dominate thus improving the nre of the reactor trichococcus is facultative anaerococcus which has the characteristics of degrading organic matter when fe2 concentration was increased to 3 0 mg l trihococcus abundance increased from 5 20 to 9 65 the genus in proteobacteria were thauera and denitratisoma both of which have denitrification functions with the increase of fe2 concentration their abundance increased by 0 64 and 7 66 respectively therefore the increase of appropriate fe2 concentration can strengthen the activity of denitrifying bacteria in the biofilm thus weakening the inhibition of organic matter and enhancing the activity of anammox in conclusion the fe2 concentration of 3 0 mg l can not only enhance the activity of anammox bacteria and microorganisms with the function of degrading organic matter but also improve the abundance of the genus with the function of heterotrophic denitrification the two kinds of bacteria coexist in the reactor forming biofilms with high denitrification efficiency and stability the nre of anammox biofilm reactor was improved 4 discussion fig 7 shows the relationship between anammox bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in the reactor according to the experimental results the addition of fe2 enhances the nre of the anammox reactor in three aspects first the abundance of planctomycetota and candidatus jettenia increased by 0 86 and 0 89 when the concentration of fe2 increased from 0 15 mg l to 3 mg l which indicated that fe2 had a certain promotion on the growth of anammox bacteria second the removal rate of nh4 n increased from 67 98 to 83 64 when the concentration of fe2 increased from 0 15 mg l to 4 5 mg l it can be inferred that the addition of fe2 strengthens the accumulation of no2 n in the reactor thus strengthening the anammox reaction and removing ammonia nitrogen in that the denitrification reaction in the reactor cannot remove nh4 n third when fe2 concentration was controlled at 0 15 mg l and 3 0 mg l the proteobacteria abundance was 31 81 and 29 01 and the average concentration of no3 n in the reactor effluent fluctuates between 1 06 and 2 44 mg l it can be analyzed that fe2 seldom inhibited the denitrification reaction in the reactor under the condition of organic matter exists and fe2 and organic matter together serve as electron donors in denitrification promoting nitrogen removal therefore adding appropriate fe2 under the inhibition of organic matter in an anammox reactor can not only restore the nre of the reactor but also realize the synergistic denitrification of anammox and denitrification to a certain extent this study provides a new way for restoring the anammox reactor polluted by organic matter however the excessive presence of iron in water will pollute the environment and each region has strict requirements on the concentration of iron in effluent water nowadays so adding fe2 in the anammox reactor should be considered at discretion 5 conclusion in summary this study demonstrated that low concentration fe2 addition under organic matter inhibition can facilitate the nitrogen removal performance of anammox systems 16s rrna high throughput sequencing showed that anammox and denitrification are enhanced while the concentration of fe2 was 3 0 mg l denitratisoma and jettenia were the predominant denitrification and anammox genus throughout the entire experiment period respectively and their abundance increased with increasing fe2 promotion therefore an appropriate addition of fe2 under the condition of organic inhibition anammox bacteria and denitrifying bacteria coexist in the reactor forming biofilms with high nre and stability in this study although the ways of increasing nre of anammox reactor with fe2 addition under organic inhibition were analyzed the respective roles of fe2 based denitrification and anammox could not be clarified subsequent studies can quantitatively analyze and investigate the mechanism that fe2 improves the nre of anammox under the inhibition of organic matter declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

13152,the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of fe2 on the nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox under the inhibition of organic matter in the experiment the influent c n was controlled at about 2 25 by synthetic water and the up flow anammox reactor was run at 0 15 1 5 3 0 and 4 5 mg l fe2 respectively the number of denitrifying bacteria and the characteristics of microbial community in the reactor were analyzed by most probably number method and high throughput sequencing method the results show that when the influent c n and fe2 are controlled at 2 25 and 0 15 mg l respectively the tn removal efficiency can reach 82 15 when fe2 concentration increased to 1 5 3 0 and 4 5 mg l tn removal efficiency increased by 4 00 6 89 and 7 77 respectively in terms of microbes the abundance of denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria increased collectively with the addition of fe2 when the fe2 increased from 0 15 mg l to 3 mg l the number of denitrifying bacteria in the bottom and middle of the reactor increased from 1 62 108 and 2 74 107 to 8 06 108 and 3 76 107 respectively in the middle of the reactor the abundance of planctomycetota and candidatus jettenia with anammox function increased from 4 01 and 2 18 to 4 87 and 3 17 respectively therefore appropriate fe2 addition can promote the growth of denitrifying functional bacteria and anammox bacteria in the anammox reactor inhibited by organic matter thus improving the denitrification efficiency of the reactor it can provide a reference value for the anammox reactor to treat actual municipal wastewater containing organic matter keywords anammox fe2 organic matter nitrogen removal microbial abundance 1 introduction anammox is a new technology with low energy consumption and strong nitrogen removal ability in biological treatment 1 2 it has the advantages of no additional carbon source for nitrogen removal low sludge production and high efficiency for nitrogen removal 3 many studies show that anammox has been successfully applied to the industrial treatment of high ammonium wastewater 4 5 nowadays many scholars have begun to research the treatment of actual sewage by anammox 6 7 in reality the actual sewage often exists in various kinds of organic matter with different concentrations and denitrifying bacteria could use organic matter to remove no3 n generated by anammox reaction while the concentration of organic matter is low 8 9 however if the concentration of organic matter is too high denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria will compete with substrate no2 n thus affecting the anammox reaction 10 11 pijuan m et al studied the influence of cod on anammox reactor under short term and long term conditions and they found that short term cod addition did not increase the concentration of ammonia nitrogen so it did not affect anammox activity however long term addition of cod will reduce the activity of anammox and cause the transfer of microbial community which will lead to the reduction of anammox fraction 12 winkler et al found that anammox bacteria could better compete with heterotrophic denitrification bacteria and anammox bacteria could make use of organic matter in sewage to lower the effluent nitrate concentration and improve the denitrification effect of the reactor while the c n ratio of influent water was less than 0 5 13 therefore how to improve the nitrogen removal efficiency nre of organic wastewater is one of the key points of anammox research the most abundant transition metal in biological systems is iron and fe2 is one of the most abundant metals in wastewater 14 15 fe2 is readily available cheap and more effective in precipitation pollution control phosphorus and antibiotic removal in sewage treatment plants 16 in anammox fe2 is incorporated into protein cofactors and serves either catalytic redox or regulatory purposes anammox bacteria rely heavily on iron containing proteins especially cytochromes for their energy conservation which occurs within a unique organelle the anammoxosome 17 fe2 is both a microelement required for microbial growth and one of the essential elements for the synthesis of heme c which is involved in the metabolic process of anammox as an important cofactor 18 19 therefore it is speculated that adding fe2 may improve the of the anammox reactor yang et al found that under the impetus of fe2 fe3 cycle iron can act as a catalyst to trigger the reaction between nh4 n and no3 n and simultaneously remove nitrate and ammonium salt providing an efficient economic and new denitrification method for the treatment of wastewater containing high nitrogen 20 liu et al found that there was a linear correlation between the amount of fe2 incorporation and the removal efficiency of nh4 n in the single stage nitrogen removal process when fe2 and fe3 concentrations were lower than 1 3 mg l and 0 4 mg l respectively excessive fe2 and fe3 can reduce sludge activity sludge concentration and the number of functional microbial communities 21 in terms of microbes lara sindhu et al studied the effect of fe2 on the anammox system and found that the addition of fe2 increased the abundance of candidatus brocadia fe2 oxidation activated central metabolism by upregulation of key functional genes hdh and hao of anammox bacteria meanwhile extracellular polymer eps content was also increased leading to rapid improvement of the anammox system 22 the fe2 could serve as electron donor for the anammox genera kuenenia stuttgartiensis coupled with the nitrate reduction to nitrite 23 s qiao et al found that appropriate increase of fe2 could be conductive to accumulation of fe element inside anammox cell which was further beneficial for heme c synthesis improvement of crude hdh activity and the growth of anammox biomass 24 from the research of scholars it is not difficult to find that fe2 plays a positive role in anammox and appropriate fe2 addition can participate in the metabolic process of anammox and enhance the activity of anammox bacteria however until today although a large number of studies have been conducted on the effect of fe2 on anammox there are few reports on whether fe2 can improve the nre of anammox under the condition of organic inhibition in summary the main aims of this study include 1 effect of fe2 addition on the nre of anammox reactor under the condition of organic matter inhibition 2 characteristics of the microbial community in anammox reactor with fe2 addition under the condition of organic matter inhibition 3 discussion about the effect of fe2 on nitrogen conversion in the anammox reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and operation an up flow anaerobic coupled biofilm reactor with an effective volume of 6 28 l which adopts a peristaltic pump to continuously feed water with a daily inflow of 38 l and a hydraulic retention time of 4 h was constructed fig 1 the bottom of the reactor was laid with a 10 cm pebble layer and the middle of the reactor was filled with 1 cm 1 cm 1 cm polyurethane porous carriers accounting for 47 of the volume at the top of the reactor is a three phase separator the reactor was cultured in a thermostatic chamber without light and the water temperature was controlled at 30 32 c by an indoor temperature control system 2 2 inoculate sludge and synthetic water reactor inoculation sludge was collected from an a2 o anaerobic anoxic oxic process sewage treatment plant in lanzhou and the amount of sludge was controlled at 5 l wastewater was synthesized with a composition of sucrose 37 5 mg l nh4cl 157 5 mg l and nano2 262 5 mg l et al and all of experimental drugs were analytical pure in order to create the conditions of anammox under the inhibition of organic matter the c n of influent was 2 25 which originated from the research group s previous research section 3 1 and other people s research 25 26 the stoichiometry of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n to nitrite nitrogen no2 n in synthetic water was 1 1 32 and the concentrations were 39 04 40 91 mg l and 51 22 54 07 mg l respectively the fe2 concentration was controlled by feso4 7h2o at 0 15 1 5 3 5 4 5 mg l in four stages respectively and the influent ph range was 7 4 7 7 other compositions of the synthetic wastewater are listed as follow 20 mg l kh2po4 20 mg l cacl2 20 mg l mgso4 7h20 1 ml l

through 0 45 μm filter paper and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c before analysis the concentration of fe2 was determined by the 1 10 phenanthroline standard method the cod concentration was determined using a cod tester hach dr5000 the tn nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were determined using normative methods 27 2 4 most probably number method the denitrifying bacteria in the reactor were counted by mpn most probably number method 28 in this study denitrifying bacteria in the middle and bottom of anammox reactor with different fe2 concentrations under organic matter inhibition were tested by a series of gradient dilution culture and color detection to find out the corresponding number of possible bacteria according to the number of color tube in the test about 10 g of the packing with biofilm was taken and stirred in buffer solution or sterile water for 30 min and the mixture of bacteria and water was diluted for culture 2 5 microbial community analysis when the fe2 concentration was 0 15 mg l and 3 0 mg l the biofilms on the filler surface at 40 cm from bottom to top in the reactor were taken as samples which were named fe1 40 and fe3 40 respectively the two samples were explored by illumina miseq sequencing to determine the microbial community structure samples were sent to majorbio company shanghai china the universal primer pair 338 f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806 r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 was utilized for amplification and sequencing of the 16 s rrna gene v3 v4 region all data analyses were finished by i sanger cloud platform www i sanger com sequencing reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at an identity threshold of 0 97 the functional genes were established using picrust2 function prediction 29 30 31 152 reads were obtained from each sample after subsampling and the coverage was greater than 99 6 indicating that the diversity of the microbial community could be well 3 results and analysis anammox reactor used in this experiment has been operating stably for one year the hydraulic load was 2 4 m3 m2 day and the influent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and cod were 40 53 and 90 mg l respectively the experiments were divided into four different phases to investigate the effect of fe2 on the nitrogen removal of anammox biofilm reactor under the condition of organic inhibition which is based on fe2 concentrations phase i 0 15 day 0 15 mg l phase ii 16 30 day 1 5 mg l phase iii 31 45 day 3 mg l phase iv 46 60 day 4 5 mg l 3 1 influence of organics on nre of anammox before this experiment we have investigated the nre of the anammox reactor under the condition of different c n to explore the c n which form an inhibition on anammox fig 2 the experiment was divided into four stages 0 0 75 1 5 and 2 25 of c n for a total of 60 days the stoichiometry of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n to nitrite nitrogen no2 n in water was controlled at 1 1 32 and the concentrations were 39 04 40 91 mg l and 51 22 54 07 mg l respectively the influent cod prepared by sucrose were 0 29 10 31 50 59 05 63 00 88 15 93 20 mg l respectively the influent ph range was 7 4 7 7 and the addition amount of trace elements was 2 ml l 1 31 when c n was 0 the effluent was mainly no3 n with an average concentration of 22 5 mg l and the nre was 83 49 fig 2a b with the increase of c n to 0 75 and 1 5 no3 n concentration in effluent decreased to 15 2 mg l and 9 7 mg l respectively and nre increased by 6 36 and 11 5 respectively when the c n ratio further increased to 2 25 the nre decreased to 82 21 and the effluent nh4 n and no3 n increased to 15 1 mg l and 24 3 mg l respectively these results indicate that appropriate organic matter addition can enhance the nre of anammox reactor but high concentration will cause the inhibition this is consistent with the results of guo m et al 32 the addition of a small amount of organic matter provided nutrients for heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria without inhibiting the anammox reaction and promotes the growth of denitrifying bacteria microorganisms enabling them to remove no3 n through denitrification chen c et al found that when the feeding cod concentration was lower than 99 7 mg l in an anaerobic baffled reactor abr anammox reactor nitrogen removal could be enhanced via the coexistence of denitrification and anammox which is similar to the conclusion of this experiment 33 however under a high concentration of organic matter denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria compete in the biofilm which inhibits the growth of anammox bacteria and is not conducive to anammox nitrogen removal thus making the denitrification performance of the reactor poor chen c found that 150 and 200 mg l of cod caused the disintegration of anammox granular sludge while also reducing extracellular polymeric substances eps content mechanical strength and sedimentation performance respectively 34 in view of the inhibition of organic matter on the denitrification performance of anammox reactor this experiment further investigated whether the addition of fe2 can improve the denitrification performance of the reactor again 3 2 influence of fe2 on nre of anammox when the anammox function returned to normal and stable operation for 3 months after adding synthetic wastewater without organic matter to the same anammox reactor sucrose was added into the water again to control the c n at 2 25 so as to investigate the effect of fe2 on the nre of anammox under the inhibition of organic matter with the increase of fe2 concentration the no2 n removal efficiency was always higher than 95 fig 3 a the result indicates that fe2 has no significant effect on the removal efficiency of no2 n in the reactor which may be due to the fact that no2 n as a common substrate of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria is completely removed in the competition between them in phase i 0 15 day 0 15 mg l the average effluent concentration of nh4 n is 12 63 mg l and the average removal efficiency of nh4 n was 67 98 it is speculated that organic matter hurts the activity of anammox bacteria and the main way of nitrogen removal is denitrification denitrifying bacteria grew at a faster rate anammox bacteria were at a disadvantage when competing with denitrifying bacteria for living space and substrate meanwhile the consumption of h in the denitrification process leads to the increase of ph of the system which further inhibits the growth of anammox bacteria resulting in a poor removal effect of nh4 n in the reactor 35 36 in phase ii 16 30 day 1 5 mg l and phase iii 31 45 day 3 mg l with the increase of fe2 concentration the average effluent concentration of nh4 n decreased to 9 04 mg l and 7 13 mg l and the average removal efficiency of nh4 n increased by 9 31 and 13 9 compared with phase i respectively the increase of nh4 n removal efficiency was no longer obvious and stabilized at about 83 64 during phase iv it can be speculated that a small amount of fe2 can promote the removal effect of nh4 n in the 0anammox reactor which is under the inhibition of organic matter as shown in fig 3b the average concentration of no3 n in the reactor effluent fluctuates between 1 06 and 2 44 mg l and fe2 had no obvious influence on the no3 n removal effect fe2 promoted the growth of anammox bacteria enhanced the nre of anammox and weakened the competition of denitrifying bacteria on no2 n under the condition of high influent cod denitrifying bacteria have limited available substrate which made denitrifying bacteria use no3 n to denitrification and remove it thoroughly the average nre of phase i was 82 15 indicating that the nre of the reactor was inhibited by c n of 2 25 the nre of phase ii and phase iii continued to rise due to the reduction of effluent nh4 n concentration which was 4 and 6 89 higher than that of phase i respectively in phase iv fe2 was 4 5 mg l the nre remained at 89 92 at this point anammox played a leading role and denitrifying bacteria degraded the nitrate produced by the anammox reaction and improve nre in conclusion under the condition of organic matter inhibition appropriate fe2 addition can effectively enhance the nre of anammox biofilm reactor 3 3 influence of fe2 on the number of denitrifying bacteria the number of denitrifying bacteria in biofilm was counted by the mpn method as shown in table 1 according to the data in the table the number of denitrifying bacteria in the bottom part of the reactor increased by an order of magnitude compared with that in the middle part under different fe2 concentrations the main reason was that the device was an up flow column reactor and most of the organic matter accumulated at the bottom of the reactor under the action of gravity thus promoting the growth of denitrifying bacteria with the increase of fe2 concentration from 0 15 mg l to 3 mg l the number of denitrifying bacteria in the bottom and middle increased from 1 62 108 and 2 74 107 to 8 06 108 and 3 76 107 respectively therefore it can be inferred that the addition of fe2 can enhance the activity of denitrifying bacteria in the anammox reactor under the inhibition of organic matter 3 4 effect of fe2 on microbial community in anammox reactor 3 4 1 diversity of bacterial community in anammox reactor in this study high throughput sequencing was used to analyze the microbial community in the middle of the reactor at two kinds of fe2 concentrations under the organic matter inhibition the credibility of this sequencing was ensured by the good coverage table 2 and the flattening rarefaction curve fig 4 37 the microbial diversity index of the two samples is shown in table 2 and the library coverage efficiency of each sample is quite close to 1 00 from the table with the increase of fe2 concentration ace simpsom and chao indices were all increased while shannon index gradually was decreased ace and chao indexes were richness indices which were positively correlated with the richness of microbial species simpson was negatively correlated with the diversity of microbial communities 38 39 therefore it can be speculated that the addition of fe2 under organic matter inhibition decreased slightly the number of microbial species but enriched the community in the reactor 3 4 2 microbial community composition of anammox reactor analyzed by phylum level fig 5 the main dominant phyla in both samples were proteobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes and planctomycetota the planctomycetota are anammox functional bacterium and its abundance can reflect whether the anammox reaction in the reactor is inhibited to a certain extent 40 41 when the fe2 concentration was controlled at 3 0 mg l the abundance of planctomycetota was 4 87 which increased by 0 86 compared with 0 15 mg l firmicutes could decompose organic matter and improve the ability of the microbial community to resistance against toxic substances 42 in anammox reactor the abundance of firmicutes increased from 7 80 to 10 69 with the increase of fe2 concentration hence under the condition of 3 mg l fe2 and organic matter inhibition the anammox bacteria in the middle part was relatively active and the competitive advantage of heterotrophic microorganisms has been reduced due to the decomposition of organic matter at this time the synergistic effect of anammox and denitrifying bacteria improved the nre of the reactor in anammox reactor many microorganisms in proteobacteria have the function of denitrification using organic carbon sources 43 45 when fe2 concentration was controlled at 0 15 mg l and 3 0 mg l the proteobacteria abundance was 31 81 and 29 01 respectively the decrease of proteobacteria abundance was mainly due to the enhancement of anammox activity and degradation of organic matter chlorobacteria can hydrolyze organic matter and participate in biofilm formation under anaerobic conditions compared with 0 15 mg l fe2 the abundance of chlorobacteria at 3 0 mg l decreased by 1 32 which increased the abundance of the planctomycetota due to the increase of available inorganic carbon sources and improved the activity of the anammox fig 6 shows that candidatus jettenia and candidatus brocadia are the anammox bacteria with high abundance in the reactor at the genus classification level 46 47 when the fe2 concentration increased from 0 15 mg l to 3 0 mg l the abundance of candidatus jettenia increased from 2 18 to 3 07 while the abundance of candidatus brocadia decreased from 1 72 to 0 82 according to the nre of the reactor and the number of otu567 it can be inferred that increasing the fe2 concentration can improve the activity and growth rate of candidatus jettenia and increase the abundance of anammox bacteria so that the anammox bacteria gradually dominate thus improving the nre of the reactor trichococcus is facultative anaerococcus which has the characteristics of degrading organic matter when fe2 concentration was increased to 3 0 mg l trihococcus abundance increased from 5 20 to 9 65 the genus in proteobacteria were thauera and denitratisoma both of which have denitrification functions with the increase of fe2 concentration their abundance increased by 0 64 and 7 66 respectively therefore the increase of appropriate fe2 concentration can strengthen the activity of denitrifying bacteria in the biofilm thus weakening the inhibition of organic matter and enhancing the activity of anammox in conclusion the fe2 concentration of 3 0 mg l can not only enhance the activity of anammox bacteria and microorganisms with the function of degrading organic matter but also improve the abundance of the genus with the function of heterotrophic denitrification the two kinds of bacteria coexist in the reactor forming biofilms with high denitrification efficiency and stability the nre of anammox biofilm reactor was improved 4 discussion fig 7 shows the relationship between anammox bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in the reactor according to the experimental results the addition of fe2 enhances the nre of the anammox reactor in three aspects first the abundance of planctomycetota and candidatus jettenia increased by 0 86 and 0 89 when the concentration of fe2 increased from 0 15 mg l to 3 mg l which indicated that fe2 had a certain promotion on the growth of anammox bacteria second the removal rate of nh4 n increased from 67 98 to 83 64 when the concentration of fe2 increased from 0 15 mg l to 4 5 mg l it can be inferred that the addition of fe2 strengthens the accumulation of no2 n in the reactor thus strengthening the anammox reaction and removing ammonia nitrogen in that the denitrification reaction in the reactor cannot remove nh4 n third when fe2 concentration was controlled at 0 15 mg l and 3 0 mg l the proteobacteria abundance was 31 81 and 29 01 and the average concentration of no3 n in the reactor effluent fluctuates between 1 06 and 2 44 mg l it can be analyzed that fe2 seldom inhibited the denitrification reaction in the reactor under the condition of organic matter exists and fe2 and organic matter together serve as electron donors in denitrification promoting nitrogen removal therefore adding appropriate fe2 under the inhibition of organic matter in an anammox reactor can not only restore the nre of the reactor but also realize the synergistic denitrification of anammox and denitrification to a certain extent this study provides a new way for restoring the anammox reactor polluted by organic matter however the excessive presence of iron in water will pollute the environment and each region has strict requirements on the concentration of iron in effluent water nowadays so adding fe2 in the anammox reactor should be considered at discretion 5 conclusion in summary this study demonstrated that low concentration fe2 addition under organic matter inhibition can facilitate the nitrogen removal performance of anammox systems 16s rrna high throughput sequencing showed that anammox and denitrification are enhanced while the concentration of fe2 was 3 0 mg l denitratisoma and jettenia were the predominant denitrification and anammox genus throughout the entire experiment period respectively and their abundance increased with increasing fe2 promotion therefore an appropriate addition of fe2 under the condition of organic inhibition anammox bacteria and denitrifying bacteria coexist in the reactor forming biofilms with high nre and stability in this study although the ways of increasing

13153,in this study fe c3n4 composite was synthesized via high temperature calcination and employed for enhanced pollutants degradation in fenton like process the typical thiazine dye methylene blue mb acted as the target contaminant to research the activity of the proposed catalytic system the physicochemical properties of the fe c3n4 catalyst were systematically characterized by various techniques and different reaction parameters were examined to optimize the catalytic process in the fe c3n4 h2o2 catalytic system 100 ml 5 mg l mb could be entirely degraded within 60 min by adding 0 15 g l catalyst and 10 mm h2o2 and the high efficiency could be maintained around a wide ph range 3 11 the results of quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis showed that hydroxyl radical oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 were the main active species generated in the oxidation system the fe nx group formed by the chelation of fe iii with the n atom of g c3n4 is the crucial active site of the fe c3n4 composite based on this bond not only electrons can be quickly transferred from h2o2 to fe iii initiating the fenton like process but also the leaching of fe ions can be prevented benefiting the eco friendliness of the reaction because of its high efficiency and stability the proposed fe c3n4 fenton like process provides a promising way for actual wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fe c3n4 fenton like reaction thiazine dye catalysis wastewater treatment 1 introduction in recent years with the rapid development of the economy environmental pollution has become increasingly severe and a large amount of industrial wastewater has been discharged into the environment 1 2 among them printing and dyeing wastewater makes up a large portion due to the widespread application of dyes in the printing paper and textile industries dyes in water can seriously affect water quality transparency and dissolved oxygen concentration interfering with photosynthesis by aquatic plants and causing great damage to the environment methylene blue mb is a typical phenothiazine salt and a common basic cationic dye as a biochemical colorant it is widely used in the textile industries so it has become a typical pollutant in printing and dyeing wastewater 3 long term exposure to dye pollutants can seriously affect health of biological organisms causing nausea vomiting shock and breathing difficulties and sometimes even cancer and genetic mutations 4 6 conventional treatment methods for organic pollutants include membrane separation coagulation ozone oxidation and adsorption 7 9 but these methods also have many shortcomings membrane separation can only transfer pollutants but does not entirely degrade pollutants making it prone to secondary pollution coagulation is inefficient for dissolved small molecule organic matter ozone oxidation consumes high levels of energy and there is also the problem of ozone gas pollution adsorption process only achieves the migration of pollutants cannot realize degradation even mineralization and the sludge disposal is a remaining problem needing consideration 10 advanced oxidation processes aops which function by generating reactive oxidizing species are an efficient way to treat refractory organics in wastewater 11 12 as one advanced oxidation technology fenton oxidation technology is widely used to degrade various pollutants thanks to its low cost high efficiency simple operation and mild reaction conditions 13 14 in other words it s one of the most well established methods for deep treatment of organic micropollutants in water the traditional fenton reaction utilizes fe2 and h2o2 to generate fe3 and oh 15 16 as a strong oxidizing free radical with no selectivity the resulting oh can react with most organic pollutants to remove them 17 however the traditional homogeneous fenton reaction has some inherent disadvantages such as narrow ph range 3 secondary pollution with generous iron sludge low effective utilization rate of h2o2 and difficult separation of catalyst all of which limit its practical applications 18 therefore heterogeneous fenton like reactions using solid catalysts have been developed to conquer the disadvantages of the homogeneous fenton reaction 18 20 graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 is a kind of polymeric layered material with a graphite like structure which can be easily prepared by polymerization of inexpensive precursors such as urea 21 dicyandiamide 22 and melamine 23 as a relatively new inorganic non metallic material g c3n4 has excellent chemical stability and good application potential as a photocatalyst but it is rarely applied to fenton reaction systems in addition the catalytic activity of bulk g c3n4 synthesized by direct thermal pyrolysis is not satisfactory due to its low surface area large particle diameter and agglomeration tendency limiting its application 24 to improve the catalytic activity of g c3n4 it is often modified by nitrogen doping 25 nitrogen vacancy 26 active metal doping 27 and preparation of mesoporous g c3n4 28 29 several studies have found that doping g c3n4 with metal can successfully enhance its activity in photocatalytic processes and oxygen reduction reactions 30 31 as one of the most promising elements the doping of fe in g c3n4 has attracted increasing attention 32 it has been reported that the six n lone pair electrons of g c3n4 can act as a matrix to disperse and couple fe forming fe n microstructures and preventing fe leaching 33 34 based on this interaction loading fe on g c3n4 can create a new type of fenton like catalyst which can effectively overcome the shortcomings of traditional iron based catalysts 35 38 however for the reported fe doped g c3n4 catalysts table 1 most of them require the participation of light for pollutants removal which largely increases the energy consumption and limits the applicability of the catalysts in addition the adsorption capacity of these catalysts is generally weak not conducive to the close contact between catalyst pollutant and oxidant which slows down the degradation rate to a certain extent obtaining efficient pollutant removal efficiency often requires the addition of more catalysts and oxidants which substantially increases the cost and burden of actual wastewater treatment therefore developing a cost effective fenton like process with simpler reaction conditions and higher activity remains a priority goal in the field in this study an fe doped g c3n4 fenton like catalyst was synthesized via high temperature calcination with the raw materials of melamine and fecl3 6h2o and its catalytic activity was investigated by mb degradation compared with the aforementioned systems the proposed fe c3n4 catalyst has a good performance for h2o2 activation with a little dosage of catalyst and oxidant benefiting for eco friendliness and cost effectiveness moreover the relatively higher adsorption efficiency contributes to the close contact between reactants facilitating the catalytic process sem xrd ft ir xps and bet were employed to characterize the physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts the reaction conditions were optimized by changing the experimental parameters including fe doping level catalyst and h2o2 dosage initial mb concentration and initial solution ph in addition the mechanism of h2o2 activation and pollutant removal in the fe c3n4 h2o2 system was systematically explored based on the results of quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials all chemicals and materials used throughout the study are detailed in the supporting information si text s1 all chemicals were used as received the ultrapure water used throughout the experiment was prepared by milli q gradient ultrapure water system 2 2 synthesis and characterization of the catalysts fe c3n4 was prepared by high temperature calcination synthesis according to the literature with some modifications 41 in the standard synthesis 100 ml ultrapure water was firstly heated to 100 c and 5 ml hcl was added to it immediately afterwards 5 g melamine and a certain amount of fecl3 6h2o based on 5 g melamine the relative mass fraction of fecl3 6h2o were 5 10 20 and 30 respectively were dissolved in this solution in turn and stirred vigorously for 0 5 h to obtain a homogeneous solution finally this solution was heated continuously until the water had evaporated completely after cooling to room temperature the resultant solid was gathered and ground into a powder to obtain the precursor a certain amount of precursor was placed into a magnetic boat and heated to 550 c at 5 c min in a tube furnace under n2 atmosphere and kept for 6 h after naturally cooling to room temperature the fe c3n4 composite catalyst was obtained by grinding with an agate mortar similarly g c3n4 was prepared by the same method in the absence of an fe source in order to simplify the language expression the ratio of fecl3 6h2o is utilized to represent the level of fe doping in this work the microstructure and physicochemical properties of the samples were comprehensively characterized by various methods and detailed information is provided in supporting information si text s2 2 3 catalytic performance and mechanism of fe c3n4 composites the catalytic performance of the fe c3n4 catalyst was evaluated by mb removal efficiency in the fenton like system the catalytic process was carried out in a 100 ml glass beaker in a typical experiment 15 mg catalyst was dispersed in 100 ml 5 mg l mb solution and stirred continuously in the dark for 10 min to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium then 100 μl h2o2 30 was added to the suspension for initiating the fenton like reaction it is worth stating that all reactions were carried out at an initial mb ph of 5 86 since mb has a maximum absorption peak at 662 nm fig s1 the concentration of mb can be determined by measuring the absorbance of the sample after the reaction began 3 ml reaction solution was collected at specific time intervals and immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm millipore filters and then the absorbance was measured at 662 nm using a uv vis spectrometer tu 1901 beijing purkinje general instruments co ltd china the electrochemical characterization of the samples is presented in the supporting information si text s3 in order to avoid random errors and ensure the accuracy of experimental data all experiments were performed in triplicate the experimental results showed that the relative error was less than 5 to study the kinetics of mb degradation in the fenton like system the apparent reaction rate constant kapp of mb degradation was estimated by the pseudo first order rate expression eq 1 1 ln c t c 0 k app t where ct and c0 are the residual mb concentrations at time t and time zero after adsorption in the dark respectively and k min 1 represents the pseudo first order rate constant quenching experiments revealed the types of active species produced in the fenton like system and their contribution to mb removal tert butyl alcohol tba sodium azide nan3 p benzoquinone bq and silver nitrate agno3 were selected as the quenchers of oh 1o2 o2 and e respectively 45 48 in addition the detection of active species was conducted by epr where the dmpo was used as the capture agent for oh and o2 and temp was served as the capture agent for 1o2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization surface morphologies and microstructures of the catalysts were explored by sem as shown in fig 1a g c3n4 is a flat shaped nanoparticle it is stacked with irregular lamellar structures and has no apparent pore structure after doping with fe the dense layered structure began to decompose forming a porous multi pleated structure as gases were released during the heating process fig 1b this indicated that fe doping could refine g c3n4 grains and expand the pore volume of the catalyst thus enhancing the contact between samples and pollutants and improving the fenton like performance of the catalyst in addition the edx mapping test fig s2 showed that c n and fe elements were uniformly dispersed on the surface of 20 fe c3n4 fig 2 shows the tem images of the catalysts it can be seen that g c3n4 has a typical multilayer lamellar structure and 20 fe c3n4 presents a nanosheet structure similar to g c3n4 this indicated that fe doping does not change the skeletal structure of g c3n4 however the pore size of the samples significantly increased after fe doping in addition no iron oxide nanoparticle appeared which suggested that fe ions may be doped into the framework of g c3n4 by chemical bonding the surface functional groups of the catalysts were explored by ft ir fig 3a for pure g c3n4 five absorption regions were visible in its ft ir spectrum the peak at 806 cm 1 was caused by the typical bending vibration of the triazine ring structural unit and the small peak at 887 cm 1 was attributed to the nh bond several strong peaks in the 1200 1700 cm 1 range were ascribed to the cn bond stretching vibration of aromatic rings including n c 3 and c nh c 34 the broad absorption peak in the range of 3000 3600 cm 1 was derived from the nh or oh stretching vibration of free amino or adsorbed water molecules 49 furthermore the catalyst had an absorption peak at 2173 cm 1 corresponding to cn as can be seen in fig 3a the stretching vibration of cn became increasingly obvious and shifted towards higher wavelengths as the amount of fe doping increased which indicated that there was a chemical bond between the fe and n atoms in addition the fe c3n4 composites with different doping contents exhibited similar absorption peaks typical of pure g c3n4 which indicated that the introduction of fe species did not change the chemical skeleton of g c3n4 xrd measurements were used to analyze the crystal phase and crystallinity of the catalyst there were two obvious diffraction peaks in the xrd spectrum of g c3n4 fig 3b indexing to the 100 and 002 crystal planes of g c3n4 jcpds card no 87 1526 44 50 among them the strong diffraction peak of 2θ 26 9 can be attributed to the 002 crystal diffraction plane indicative of the conjugated aromatic ring of g c3n4 and the weak peak at 13 2 was attributed to the in plane repeated tri s thiazine units corresponding to the 100 diffraction plane compared with g c3n4 the diffraction peak positions of the sample doped with fe hardly changed and there was no other fe phase material this indicated that fe ions were successfully anchored to the g c3n4 framework structure possibly by combining with n atoms to form chemical bonds and become fixed on the sheet 30 at the same time with increased fe content the 100 crystal plane gradually disappeared and the 002 crystal plane diffraction peak intensity gradually weakened this illustrated that during the calcination process fe is immobilized in the cn framework forming fe nx coordination bonds that disrupt the periodic arrangement of the basic units in g c3n4 in agreement with previous studies 51 52 however the diffraction peaks of the samples became broader after fe doping the average crystallite size of the samples was estimated by debye scherrer equation and that of g c3n4 5 fe c3n4 10 fe c3n4 20 fe c3n4 and 30 fe c3n4 were 16 48 14 84 14 81 14 25 and 14 08 nm respectively 29 this indicated that the doping of fe will reduce the crystallinity of the sample and the catalyst grains will become smaller the element composition and chemical state of the composites surface were investigated by xps 53 as shown in fig 4 peaks of c n and o were found in the xps spectrum of g c3n4 while peaks of c n o and fe were found in that of fe c3n4 it can be observed that the content of the n element was the highest followed by the c element and the o element was least abundant the trace levels of the o element were attributed to the adsorbed o2 and h2o 54 specific peak information of c 1s n 1s and fe 2p was analyzed as shown in fig 4b d fig 4b shows that the c 1s high resolution spectra were fitted into three characteristic peaks for g c3n4 the three peaks were centered at the binding energies of 284 91 286 41 and 288 51 ev the peak at 284 91 ev was related to the cc bonds of adventitious carbon contamination the peaks at 286 41 and 288 51 ev were assigned to the cn and n 2 c n groups respectively which came from the tri s triazine unit that constitutes the g c3n4 backbone 55 56 the c 1s spectrum of fe c3n4 was similar to that of g c3n4 but with a larger fraction of the cn and n 2 cn groups and their peaks had shifted towards lower binding energies by 0 05 and 0 35 ev respectively these changes might be due to the formation of fe nx bonds when fe was doped into g c3n4 which affected the chemical environment of the adjacent c atoms fig 4c displays the n 1s high resolution spectra of composites for pure g c3n4 the n 1s spectrum can be split into three peaks located at 398 98 400 45 and 401 68 ev respectively among them the strong peak at 398 98 ev corresponded to the sp2 n c n c or pyridine n in the triazine units 57 58 and the peaks at 400 45 and 401 68 ev were attributed to tertiary nitrogen n c 3 or graphite n and amino functional groups c n h respectively 59 60 these three characteristic peaks were also present in the n 1s high resolution spectrum of fe c3n4 these n states constitute the basic unit of g c3n4 indicating that the framework of g c3n4 was unchanged by binding with the fe iii species but the binding energies of these three peaks in the 20 fe c3n4 did have slight shifts compared to pure g c3n4 indicating a change in the chemical state of hybridized n after doping with fe in addition a new peak at about 399 10 ev appeared in the n 1s spectrum of 20 fe c3n4 which corresponded to the fe nx group porphyrin n formed by the chelation of the fe iii center with the n atom 41 fig 4d shows the fe 2p high resolution spectrum the characteristic peaks belonging to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p3 2 can be observed around 710 45 and 723 67 ev respectively in particular the binding energy of fe 2p3 2 was in the range of the fe iii valence 710 3 711 8 ev which was higher than that of fe ii 709 2 ev this indicated that fe iii from fecl3 aqueous solution was not reduced to fe or fe ii during the catalyst preparation but existed as its metal salt phase fe iii which was consistent with the previously published results 33 in addition in the fe 2p spectrum of fe c3n4 no peaks related to zero valent iron were detected suggesting that fe was more likely to bind to pyridine n 40 the above characterization results indicated that fe iii successfully coordinated with n atoms to form fe iii n groups in addition to the two main lines of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 apparent in the figure fe iii satellite peaks also occurred at 714 29 and 728 89 ev xps elemental analysis table s1 showed that the c n ratio of the pure g c3n4 sample was 0 84 close to the theoretical value of 0 75 which indicates that the g c3n4 synthesized in this study has a high degree of graphitization 61 in contrast the actual fe content of 20 fe c3n4 was only 2 11 ωt much less than 20 this was because during the fe c3n4 catalyst preparation the dose ratio is calculated based on the overall molecular weight of the feedstock fecl3 6h2o in addition the specific surface area and pore properties of the as prepared samples were characterized by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig s3 and the results are shown in table s1 the specific surface area of the 20 fe c3n4 was 16 17 m2 g which was slightly smaller than that of pure g c3n4 but it had a higher pore volume and larger pore size this was consistent with the sem and tem observations of large numbers of pore structures on the surface of the samples after fe doping the high pore capacity facilitates the adsorption of contaminants increases the number of active sites and accelerates mass transfer 62 3 2 fenton like activity test the fenton like catalytic performances of different samples were evaluated by mb degradation the catalytic activity of the fe c3n4 samples with different fe doping levels are shown in fig 5a the pure g c3n4 only adsorbed 8 of the mb in solution and could not activate h2o2 to remove mb further in contrast the fe c3n4 composite material could effectively activate h2o2 to degrade mb and the fe doping level had a significant influence on the catalytic activity with the increase of fecl3 6h2o doping ratio from 5 to 20 the h2o2 activation performance of the catalyst continued to improve however as the content of fecl3 6h2o was further increased to 30 catalytic activity decreased indicating that the fecl3 6h2o doping was optimized at 20 when the doping concentration was 20 the fe c3n4 catalyst h2o2 activation performance peaked and the mb removal reached 100 within 60 min as shown in fig s4 solutions colored by mb can be decolorized entirely combined with the characterization results this phenomenon may have two causes 1 the fe doping refines the g c3n4 grains resulting in a rougher catalyst surface and more contact between the contaminants and the catalyst 2 the addition of fe in g c3n4 formed fen bonds which may be fenton like active centers 41 63 there are many similar studies on mb removal al zaban et al synthesized agnps from honey which completely removed mb under sunlight irradiation within 72 h 64 guidolin et al prepared magnetite nanoparticles to remove mb under simulated sunlight which realized the removal efficiency of 93 4 in 210 min by 2 25 g l catalyst and 130 g l h2o2 65 hassani et al synthesized cofe2o4 mpg c3n4 nanocomposite by thermal decomposition which removed 71 64 mb in 120 min under uv irradiation 66 compared with other studies the as prepared 20 fe c3n4 can efficiently activate h2o2 without additional energy and mb can be entirely removed within 60 min with small dosages of catalyst and h2o2 which is more environmentally friendly moreover the toc removal efficiency and mb degradation rate in the system were also carefully investigated as shown in fig s5 about 40 of mb was mineralized to harmless co2 and h2o in the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 catalytic system the kinetics of the degradation reaction were fitted using pseudo first order rate equation fig s6a and the reaction rate constants were calculated fig 5b the results showed that the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 catalytic system not only had the highest degradation efficiency but also the fastest reaction rate therefore follow up experiments were carried out using 20 fe c3n4 five typical mb degradation processes were carried out to further investigate the h2o2 activation capacity of the fe c3n4 composites fig 5c it can be seen that mb removal was negligible when only h2o2 was added which showed that the oxidation capacity of h2o2 itself was not sufficient to remove mb from the wastewater in the absence of h2o2 only the adsorption process occurred and the adsorption desorption equilibrium was reached within 10 min at which point approximately 20 of mb being adsorbed on the fe c3n4 catalyst surface by electrostatic attraction hydrophobic interactions and other forces 67 at the same time in order to confirm that the reaction was a heterogeneous fenton like reaction a catalytic experiment of the eluent was carried out first the 20 fe c3n4 catalyst was dispersed in mb solution without the addition of h2o2 and stirred for 70 min the filtrate was collected at the end of stirring and then 10 mm h2o2 was added into it to initiate the catalytic reaction the results showed that the degradation efficiency of mb was almost zero fig 5c which indicated that h2o2 activation was realized by the fe active site on the catalyst surface rather than the eluted fe ions therefore the h2o2 activation process in the reaction system was typical of a heterogeneous fenton like reaction in addition the influence of h2o2 dosing method on the catalytic activity was investigated one method added h2o2 after the fe c3n4 catalyst adsorption equilibrium i e sectional reaction and the other added the fe c3n4 catalyst and h2o2 at the same time allowing simultaneous adsorption processes i e one stage reaction similar to previous studies the reaction endpoints of the two methods were almost identical and both could completely remove mb within 60 min 68 but the sectional reaction having pre adsorption process exhibited the higher reaction rate as seen in fig 5 d the rate constant of the one stage reaction was 0 068 min 1 while that of the sectional reaction was 0 075 min 1 this may be due to the fact that the contaminants were fully adsorbed on the catalyst surface during pre sorption which effectively facilitate the close contact of the catalyst contaminants and oxidant based on this conclusion the pollutants degradation in the fe c3n4 h2o2 system was achieved through the synergistic effect of adsorption and catalysis in this study the sectional reaction process was chosen for the follow up research in order to eliminate the interference of adsorption and to better reveal the specific mechanism of h2o2 activation by fe c3n4 3 3 optimization of reaction conditions in fenton like reaction system the catalyst dosage the initial concentration of pollutants and h2o2 and the initial solution ph were all critical factors affecting the reaction process therefore the effect of different experimental conditions on the catalytic performance was further investigated fig 6 and the degradation kinetics of different systems were fitted using the pseudo first order equation fig s7 fig 6a displays the effect of catalyst dosage on mb removal the experimental dosages of 20 fe c3n4 ranged from 0 05 to 0 3 g l with the mb concentration fixed at 5 mg l when the dosage of 20 fe c3n4 nanocomposite was 0 05 g l the mb degradation efficiency reached 48 within 60 min and it reached 84 3 when the catalyst concentration was 0 1 g l the reaction time required for complete mb removal became shorter when the catalyst concentration was further increased from 0 1 to 0 15 0 2 or 0 3 g l in addition the degradation rate of mb significantly increased as the catalyst dosage was increased from 0 05 to 0 3 g l with reaction rate constants of 0 010 0 033 0 075 0 099 and 0 125 min 1 respectively this phenomenon can be explained that with the injection of more catalyst more reaction sites and oxidizing species are produced which accelerates the degradation of mb based on the h2o2 concentration 10 mm in the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 system 0 15 g l was determined to be the optimum catalyst dosage in this study except for catalyst dosage the initial concentration of mb was another key factor affecting the activation of h2o2 the effect of the mb concentration on catalytic activity was investigated using mb concentrations ranging from 2 5 to 20 0 mg l fig 6b obviously when the catalyst dosage was fixed the removal of mb decreased with the increase of initial mb concentration at an initial mb concentration of 2 5 mg l the mb was degraded within 45 min while 5 0 mg l mb required 60 min for complete degradation however at initial mb concentrations of 10 0 and 20 0 mg l the mb removal efficiency decreased to 72 3 and 47 8 respectively similar to the degradation efficiency the degradation rate of mb decreased rapidly with increasing initial mb concentration it can be seen that the apparent reaction rate constant was 0 124 min 1 for 2 5 mg l mb but 0 075 0 020 and 0 009 min 1 for the other three concentrations respectively this was because the quantity of free radicals generated in the system is constant when the dosages of catalysts and oxidants are fixed therefore when the initial concentration of mb was too high excess pollutant molecules could not be effectively removed under the same conditions the mb degradation efficiency decreased as its concentration increased fenton like reactions generally utilize ros reactive oxidizing species generated by h2o2 activation to degrade target pollutants in water the amount of oxidant used directly determines the yield of ros thereby influencing the pollutant degradation efficiency the influence of h2o2 concentration on the mb removal efficiency in the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 system is illustrated in fig 6c in this study we used six different h2o2 concentrations i e 2 5 5 0 7 5 10 15 and 20 mm as the h2o2 concentration increased from 2 5 to 10 mm the mb removal efficiency rose from 85 4 to 100 in 60 min and the value of kapp increased rapidly from 0 033 to 0 075 min 1 as expected the mb degradation efficiency and rate increased as the h2o2 concentration went up but when the dosage of h2o2 reached and passed 15 and 20 mm the removal efficiency of mb gradually decreased it could be seen that increasing the concentration of h2o2 initially helped to generate more active free radicals and promote the degradation of mb but excessive h2o2 had a slight inhibitory effect on mb removal this may have been due to the following reasons 1 the quantity of catalyst added into the system was fixed so the limited catalyst could only activate a portion of the h2o2 to generate active free radicals this would explain why increasing the h2o2 concentration from 10 to 20 mm did not improve the mb removal efficiency 2 there was a self quenching effect of h2o2 wherein the excess h2o2 itself produced ineffective decomposition which resulted in a scavenging effect on oh and limited the potential improvement of catalytic efficiency eqs 2 3 69 in order to achieve a balance between cost and efficiency 10 mm h2o2 was selected for subsequent experiments 2 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o 3 ho 2 oh h 2 o o 2 the ph of actual water column varies over a wide range so it is important to characterize the effect of ph on mb removal in the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 system the catalytic activity of 20 fe c3n4 was examined in solutions with different initial ph values 3 to 11 as shown in fig 6d all mb could be completely removed in 60 min at initial ph values ranging from 3 0 to 11 0 the fastest degradation rate occurred in strongly acidic solutions kapp 0 474 min 1 when the ph was 3 0 mb was completely removed within 10 min when the ph was 11 0 mb degradation reached completion in 30 min this may have been because h2o2 was more easily activated under acidic conditions generating more free radicals and promoting the degradation of mb 70 compared with the traditional fenton process which can only achieve high efficiency within a small ph range the fe c3n4 catalyst prepared in this study demonstrated a higher treatment efficiency throughout the ph range of 3 11 this indicates that the immobilization of fe ions on the g c3n4 carrier somewhat weakens the effect of ph on the fenton like system 3 4 environmental application potential 3 4 1 effects of aquatic environmental factors the composition of actual wastewater is complex and the presence of various ions and natural organic matters noms will directly affect how free radicals react during wastewater treatment therefore in order to investigate the effects of inorganic anions and noms on the catalytic activity of the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 system to anticipate the potential of this system in practical applications several typical inorganic salts and humic acids ha were added to the reaction system and the results are presented in fig 7 the mb degradation experiments were performed using the sectional procedure at a concentration of 10 mm inorganic ions compared with mb removal in normal uncontaminated conditions the presence of co3 2 and hco3 had almost no effect on mb removal but so4 2 po4 3 cl and no3 had inhibitory effects of varying degrees fig 7a among them the inhibition by no3 was the most obvious followed by po4 3 cl and so4 2 which reduced the removal efficiency of mb from 100 to 85 87 90 and 95 respectively this was either because 1 these inorganic anions competed with the pollutants for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface and hindered the progress of the catalytic reaction 2 these anions had a quenching effect on the free radicals and converted oh into no3 hocl and other free radicals with weaker oxidizing power eqs 4 5 71 72 4 no 3 oh oh no 3 5 cl oh hocl in the fe c3n4 h2o2 system the addition of ha inhibited the degradation of mb and the inhibition enhanced with increasing ha concentration fig 7b when 10 mg l ha was added to the solution only 72 of mb was degraded there were two possible causes for this result 1 the electron rich groups on the ha competed with pollutants for oh during mb degradation 2 the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of ha were adsorbed on the catalyst surface occupying the reaction sites and reducing the rate of the catalytic reaction 71 73 74 based on the above experimental results despite interference by different kinds of anions and ha the fe c3n4 h2o2 system could still remove mb in a relatively short time therefore the fe c3n4 h2o2 catalytic system has a certain tolerance to interference by the various components of a complex water matrix 3 4 2 reusability and stability of 20 fe c3n4 catalyst the reusability and stability are critical parameters in determining whether catalysts can be applied in the long term therefore a cycling experiment was conducted to investigate the continuous removal effect of mb in the proposed catalytic system as exhibited in fig 8 the activity of the catalyst decreased significantly with successive reactions and the mb removal efficiencies for the first three cycles were 100 74 and 51 respectively this may have been due to two reasons 1 the activity of doped fe decreased as the number of cycles increases 2 more degradation products are generated during the cycling process which may occupy the catalyst surface and hinder the reactions between the catalyst and mb however the catalytic activity of 20 fe c3n4 catalyst can be fully restored by heat treatment under an n2 atmosphere at 550 c this indicated that the intermediate products enriched on the catalyst surface could be effectively removed during the high temperature calcination process in addition the amount of leached fe after the reaction in different ph conditions was determined by icp ms when the initial solution ph was 3 5 86 9 and 11 the concentration of leached fe after reaction was 0 477 0 018 0 012 and 0 005 mg l respectively which are lower than the eu standard 2 mg l 52 except for strong acid conditions the amount of fe leaching was less than 0 02 mg l indicating the high stability of the catalyst therefore it has the potential for applications in complex water environments 75 the above results indicate that the as prepared 20 fe c3n4 catalyst has good economic benefits due to the low catalyst dosage low h2o2 dosage high stability and regenerability 3 5 mechanism of the fenton like system 3 5 1 evaluation of reactive oxidizing species in order to better explain the mechanism of the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 mb system the main active species contributing to mb degradation were investigated using quenching experiments here tert butyl alcohol tba sodium azide nan3 p benzoquinone bq and silver nitrate agno3 were selected as the quenchers of oh 1o2 o2 and e respectively the results showed that tba nan3 and agno3 all had certain inhibitory effects on mb degradation in the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 system and agno3 had the most pronounced inhibitory effect when an excessive amount of agno3 20 mm was added to the reaction system only 22 8 of the mb was degraded excessive tba n tba h2o2 100 1 and nan3 20 mm reduced the mb degradation efficiency from 100 to 88 and 85 respectively in contrast the addition of 20 mm bq did not affect on mb degradation the quenching experiment showed that e oh and 1o2 play major roles in the degradation of mb in addition the fe nx group was poisoned with potassium thiocyanate kscn to demonstrate that fe nx was the active center of the fenton like reaction 46 after adding 20 mm kscn the degradation efficiency of mb over 60 min decreased from 100 to 70 fig 9 this suggested that fe nx indeed existed in the fe c3n4 composites and was the active center of the fenton like reaction in agreement with the xps analysis to further confirm the reactive oxidizing species generated in this fenton like system electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy was conducted 53 the epr spectra of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo ros adducts and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp ros adducts captured during the reaction are exhibited in fig 10 obviously the addition of fe c3n4 catalyst and h2o2 resulted in an obvious dmpo oh 1 2 2 1 signal peak in the reaction system fig 10a as the reaction proceeded the dmpo oh signal first increased and then decreased slightly however as shown in the epr spectrum in fig 10b no dmpo o2 signal peak was observed at any time during the reaction as for the temp capture agent fig 10c there was already a trilinear mode signal 0 min attributable to temp 1o2 1 1 1 before the addition of fe c3n4 which was probably produced by the reaction between the dissolved oxygen in the water and temp after adding the catalyst the temp 1o2 signal showed a weak increasing trend at first and then a decreasing trend indicating that only a small amount of 1o2 was formed in the system fig 10d therefore when mb is degraded in the fe c3n4 h2o2 system both free radical pathways and non radical pathways are present and electron transfer plays a critical part in the catalytic process 3 5 2 exploration of the reaction mechanism based on the previous results and analysis a probable mechanism for the fe c3n4 h2o2 catalytic system was proposed as reported before in the similar fe c3n4 h2o2 catalytic system fe ii plays the only role for h2o2 activation 40 47 76 however according to the above analysis the doped fe in the as prepared fe c3n4 catalyst only existed as fe iii which is unable to activate h2o2 directly therefore in the proposed fe c3n4 h2o2 system fe iii must be reduced to fe ii at first for initiating the catalytic process as for the transformation process between fe iii and fe ii hu et al found that the ability of metal to capture electrons is related to the magnitude of its work function 77 specifically the greater the work function is the less likely the electrons are to leave the metal according to the references the work function of fe iii is 4 5 ev which indicates it has strong electron capturing ability and can act as an electron acceptor to accelerate the transfer process 77 based on this principle there are three pathways for the transformation of fe iii to fe ii 1 the introduced fe species can make the adjacent c atoms have higher positive charge which facilitates the adsorption of h2o2 63 78 when h2o2 comes into contact with the fe c3n4 catalyst the fe iii nx active sites combines with h2o2 to form a surface complex via the electron transfer process between fe c3n4 and h2o2 fe iii nx is reduced to fe ii nx eq 6 2 the formed fe iii nx active sites have strong electron withdrawing ability which can extract electrons from adjacent c atoms to generate fe ii nx and c eq 7 79 3 thirdly the fe c3n4 composites contain rich pyridine n and graphitic n among them pyridine n owns a large number of solitary electrons and can function as a lewis base to improve the catalytic performance 78 graphite n has a small covalent radius and high electronegativity promoting electron transfer from adjacent c atoms to n atoms 80 subsequently the electrons are further transferred to fe iii through the fe nx bonds promoting the regeneration of fe ii eqs 8 9 6 fe iii nx h 2 o 2 fe ii nx ho 2 h 7 fe iii nx e c fe ii nx c 8 n e c e n c 9 fe iii e n fe ii in order to further verify the electron transfer process of the fe c3n4 catalyst electrochemical experiments were performed chronoamperometric analysis of the fe c3n4 h2o2 catalytic system is shown in fig 11a after adding h2o2 the current density instantly increased from 0 29 to 3 68 μa cm2 indicating that the intense electron transfer process occurred between fe c3n4 and h2o2 which was similar to previous studies 40 but the current density hardly changed when mb was added suggesting that there was no electron transfer between fe c3n4 and mb because mb could not directly obtain electrons from the catalyst it must be degraded by the produced reactive oxidizing species during the h2o2 activation process moreover fig 11b compares the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis of the different catalysts it can be found that the nyquist curve radius of the fe c3n4 catalyst was smaller than that of g c3n4 which indicates fe doping can improve the conductivity of the catalyst 67 after adding h2o2 the radius of the impedance ring slightly increased due to the electrons consuming and fe circulation 47 the above results further confirm that quick transformation from fe iii to fe ii occurs in the reaction process which initiates the fenton like reaction by the fe ii generation oh and 1o2 can be produced specifically fe ii nx reacts quickly with h2o2 to generate large amounts of oh and fe iii then the generated oh attacks the mb molecules decomposing them into small molecular organics even mineralizing into co2 and h2o eqs 10 11 81 in this process the unique defects on the catalyst surface caused by fe doping facilitate the conversion of fe iii nx to fe ii nx therefore the cycle of fe iii fe ii promotes the rapid decomposition of h2o2 improving h2o2 utilization efficiency 10 fe iii nx h 2 o 2 fe ii nx oh oh 11 oh mb degraded or mineralized products in addition the non radical pathway also contributed to mb degradation in the fe c3n4 h2o2 system both quenching experiments and epr analysis confirmed that 1o2 also participated in mb removal process in order to investigate the source of 1o2 and account for the interference by dissolved oxygen the signal of 1o2 was captured in a solution pre saturated with n2 fig 11c it is clear that 1o2 was indeed produced in the fe c3n4 h2o2 system which differed from the traditional o2 induced production method 82 therefore it was concluded that h2o2 was the only source of 1o2 in the fe c3n4 h2o2 system based on the previous studies 1o2 may have been generated via the following pathways firstly ho2 can be produced during the reduction of fe iii to fe ii eqs 5 12 then through ho2 self recombination ho2 and ho reacted or the reaction between ho2 and h2o2 produced 1o2 eqs 13 15 83 86 however because the reaction rate constant between ho2 and h2o2 is only 3 m 1 s 1 which is greatly lower than the rate constants of the other two reactions k13 8 3 105 m 1 s 1 k14 7 1 109 m 1 s 1 its contribution for 1o2 generation was small 84 the specific mechanism diagram is shown in fig 12 12 c h 2 o 2 ho 2 c h 13 ho 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 1 o 2 14 ho 2 oh h 2 o 1 o 2 15 ho 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 o oh 1 o 2 quenching experiments also confirmed this conclusion the activity of fe c3n4 h2o2 fenton like system was significantly reduced after quenching free electrons by agno3 fig 9a which indicates that free electron plays a key role in the formation of reactive species in summary the fe c3n4 h2o2 fenton like system for pollutants degradation operates in both radical and non radical pathways in these processes the formed fe iii nx bond builds a bridge for electron transfer which rapidly transforms into fe ii nx initiating the fenton like reaction to generate oh and 1o2 for pollutants degradation 4 conclusions in this study a high efficiency heterogeneous fe c3n4 catalyst was successfully prepared using a simple high temperature calcination method the introduction of fe into the g c3n4 catalyst obtains a rougher surface a lower crystallinity and a higher pore volume the coordination bond formed between fe iii and pyridine n accelerates electron transfer and realizes the rapid reduction of fe iii to fe ii when the fecl3 6h2o doping concentration is 20 the activation of h2o2 by fe c3n4 is optimized the optimized conditions wherein the mb removal efficiency reached 100 within 60 min were initial mb concentration 5 mg l catalyst dosage 0 15 g l and h2o2 concentration 10 mm compared with the conventional fenton system mentioned in the past the acceptable ph range of the heterogeneous fenton like reaction proposed in this research is greatly expanded furthermore it has a certain tolerance to interference by compounds in the complex water matrix the fe iii nx bond is the active center of this fenton like reaction which prevents the fe from leaching and accelerates electron transfer to form fe ii nx thus activating h2o2 and generating more oh and 1o2 for the efficient degradation of pollutants to sum up as a new heterogeneous fenton like catalyst the emergence of fe c3n4 provides a

13153,in this study fe c3n4 composite was synthesized via high temperature calcination and employed for enhanced pollutants degradation in fenton like process the typical thiazine dye methylene blue mb acted as the target contaminant to research the activity of the proposed catalytic system the physicochemical properties of the fe c3n4 catalyst were systematically characterized by various techniques and different reaction parameters were examined to optimize the catalytic process in the fe c3n4 h2o2 catalytic system 100 ml 5 mg l mb could be entirely degraded within 60 min by adding 0 15 g l catalyst and 10 mm h2o2 and the high efficiency could be maintained around a wide ph range 3 11 the results of quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis showed that hydroxyl radical oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 were the main active species generated in the oxidation system the fe nx group formed by the chelation of fe iii with the n atom of g c3n4 is the crucial active site of the fe c3n4 composite based on this bond not only electrons can be quickly transferred from h2o2 to fe iii initiating the fenton like process but also the leaching of fe ions can be prevented benefiting the eco friendliness of the reaction because of its high efficiency and stability the proposed fe c3n4 fenton like process provides a promising way for actual wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fe c3n4 fenton like reaction thiazine dye catalysis wastewater treatment 1 introduction in recent years with the rapid development of the economy environmental pollution has become increasingly severe and a large amount of industrial wastewater has been discharged into the environment 1 2 among them printing and dyeing wastewater makes up a large portion due to the widespread application of dyes in the printing paper and textile industries dyes in water can seriously affect water quality transparency and dissolved oxygen concentration interfering with photosynthesis by aquatic plants and causing great damage to the environment methylene blue mb is a typical phenothiazine salt and a common basic cationic dye as a biochemical colorant it is widely used in the textile industries so it has become a typical pollutant in printing and dyeing wastewater 3 long term exposure to dye pollutants can seriously affect health of biological organisms causing nausea vomiting shock and breathing difficulties and sometimes even cancer and genetic mutations 4 6 conventional treatment methods for organic pollutants include membrane separation coagulation ozone oxidation and adsorption 7 9 but these methods also have many shortcomings membrane separation can only transfer pollutants but does not entirely degrade pollutants making it prone to secondary pollution coagulation is inefficient for dissolved small molecule organic matter ozone oxidation consumes high levels of energy and there is also the problem of ozone gas pollution adsorption process only achieves the migration of pollutants cannot realize degradation even mineralization and the sludge disposal is a remaining problem needing consideration 10 advanced oxidation processes aops which function by generating reactive oxidizing species are an efficient way to treat refractory organics in wastewater 11 12 as one advanced oxidation technology fenton oxidation technology is widely used to degrade various pollutants thanks to its low cost high efficiency simple operation and mild reaction conditions 13 14 in other words it s one of the most well established methods for deep treatment of organic micropollutants in water the traditional fenton reaction utilizes fe2 and h2o2 to generate fe3 and oh 15 16 as a strong oxidizing free radical with no selectivity the resulting oh can react with most organic pollutants to remove them 17 however the traditional homogeneous fenton reaction has some inherent disadvantages such as narrow ph range 3 secondary pollution with generous iron sludge low effective utilization rate of h2o2 and difficult separation of catalyst all of which limit its practical applications 18 therefore heterogeneous fenton like reactions using solid catalysts have been developed to conquer the disadvantages of the homogeneous fenton reaction 18 20 graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 is a kind of polymeric layered material with a graphite like structure which can be easily prepared by polymerization of inexpensive precursors such as urea 21 dicyandiamide 22 and melamine 23 as a relatively new inorganic non metallic material g c3n4 has excellent chemical stability and good application potential as a photocatalyst but it is rarely applied to fenton reaction systems in addition the catalytic activity of bulk g c3n4 synthesized by direct thermal pyrolysis is not satisfactory due to its low surface area large particle diameter and agglomeration tendency limiting its application 24 to improve the catalytic activity of g c3n4 it is often modified by nitrogen doping 25 nitrogen vacancy 26 active metal doping 27 and preparation of mesoporous g c3n4 28 29 several studies have found that doping g c3n4 with metal can successfully enhance its activity in photocatalytic processes and oxygen reduction reactions 30 31 as one of the most promising elements the doping of fe in g c3n4 has attracted increasing attention 32 it has been reported that the six n lone pair electrons of g c3n4 can act as a matrix to disperse and couple fe forming fe n microstructures and preventing fe leaching 33 34 based on this interaction loading fe on g c3n4 can create a new type of fenton like catalyst which can effectively overcome the shortcomings of traditional iron based catalysts 35 38 however for the reported fe doped g c3n4 catalysts table 1 most of them require the participation of light for pollutants removal which largely increases the energy consumption and limits the applicability of the catalysts in addition the adsorption capacity of these catalysts is generally weak not conducive to the close contact between catalyst pollutant and oxidant which slows down the degradation rate to a certain extent obtaining efficient pollutant removal efficiency often requires the addition of more catalysts and oxidants which substantially increases the cost and burden of actual wastewater treatment therefore developing a cost effective fenton like process with simpler reaction conditions and higher activity remains a priority goal in the field in this study an fe doped g c3n4 fenton like catalyst was synthesized via high temperature calcination with the raw materials of melamine and fecl3 6h2o and its catalytic activity was investigated by mb degradation compared with the aforementioned systems the proposed fe c3n4 catalyst has a good performance for h2o2 activation with a little dosage of catalyst and oxidant benefiting for eco friendliness and cost effectiveness moreover the relatively higher adsorption efficiency contributes to the close contact between reactants facilitating the catalytic process sem xrd ft ir xps and bet were employed to characterize the physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts the reaction conditions were optimized by changing the experimental parameters including fe doping level catalyst and h2o2 dosage initial mb concentration and initial solution ph in addition the mechanism of h2o2 activation and pollutant removal in the fe c3n4 h2o2 system was systematically explored based on the results of quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials all chemicals and materials used throughout the study are detailed in the supporting information si text s1 all chemicals were used as received the ultrapure water used throughout the experiment was prepared by milli q gradient ultrapure water system 2 2 synthesis and characterization of the catalysts fe c3n4 was prepared by high temperature calcination synthesis according to the literature with some modifications 41 in the standard synthesis 100 ml ultrapure water was firstly heated to 100 c and 5 ml hcl was added to it immediately afterwards 5 g melamine and a certain amount of fecl3 6h2o based on 5 g melamine the relative mass fraction of fecl3 6h2o were 5 10 20 and 30 respectively were dissolved in this solution in turn and stirred vigorously for 0 5 h to obtain a homogeneous solution finally this solution was heated continuously until the water had evaporated completely after cooling to room temperature the resultant solid was gathered and ground into a powder to obtain the precursor a certain amount of precursor was placed into a magnetic boat and heated to 550 c at 5 c min in a tube furnace under n2 atmosphere and kept for 6 h after naturally cooling to room temperature the fe c3n4 composite catalyst was obtained by grinding with an agate mortar similarly g c3n4 was prepared by the same method in the absence of an fe source in order to simplify the language expression the ratio of fecl3 6h2o is utilized to represent the level of fe doping in this work the microstructure and physicochemical properties of the samples were comprehensively characterized by various methods and detailed information is provided in supporting information si text s2 2 3 catalytic performance and mechanism of fe c3n4 composites the catalytic performance of the fe c3n4 catalyst was evaluated by mb removal efficiency in the fenton like system the catalytic process was carried out in a 100 ml glass beaker in a typical experiment 15 mg catalyst was dispersed in 100 ml 5 mg l mb solution and stirred continuously in the dark for 10 min to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium then 100 μl h2o2 30 was added to the suspension for initiating the fenton like reaction it is worth stating that all reactions were carried out at an initial mb ph of 5 86 since mb has a maximum absorption peak at 662 nm fig s1 the concentration of mb can be determined by measuring the absorbance of the sample after the reaction began 3 ml reaction solution was collected at specific time intervals and immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm millipore filters and then the absorbance was measured at 662 nm using a uv vis spectrometer tu 1901 beijing purkinje general instruments co ltd china the electrochemical characterization of the samples is presented in the supporting information si text s3 in order to avoid random errors and ensure the accuracy of experimental data all experiments were performed in triplicate the experimental results showed that the relative error was less than 5 to study the kinetics of mb degradation in the fenton like system the apparent reaction rate constant kapp of mb degradation was estimated by the pseudo first order rate expression eq 1 1 ln c t c 0 k app t where ct and c0 are the residual mb concentrations at time t and time zero after adsorption in the dark respectively and k min 1 represents the pseudo first order rate constant quenching experiments revealed the types of active species produced in the fenton like system and their contribution to mb removal tert butyl alcohol tba sodium azide nan3 p benzoquinone bq and silver nitrate agno3 were selected as the quenchers of oh 1o2 o2 and e respectively 45 48 in addition the detection of active species was conducted by epr where the dmpo was used as the capture agent for oh and o2 and temp was served as the capture agent for 1o2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization surface morphologies and microstructures of the catalysts were explored by sem as shown in fig 1a g c3n4 is a flat shaped nanoparticle it is stacked with irregular lamellar structures and has no apparent pore structure after doping with fe the dense layered structure began to decompose forming a porous multi pleated structure as gases were released during the heating process fig 1b this indicated that fe doping could refine g c3n4 grains and expand the pore volume of the catalyst thus enhancing the contact between samples and pollutants and improving the fenton like performance of the catalyst in addition the edx mapping test fig s2 showed that c n and fe elements were uniformly dispersed on the surface of 20 fe c3n4 fig 2 shows the tem images of the catalysts it can be seen that g c3n4 has a typical multilayer lamellar structure and 20 fe c3n4 presents a nanosheet structure similar to g c3n4 this indicated that fe doping does not change the skeletal structure of g c3n4 however the pore size of the samples significantly increased after fe doping in addition no iron oxide nanoparticle appeared which suggested that fe ions may be doped into the framework of g c3n4 by chemical bonding the surface functional groups of the catalysts were explored by ft ir fig 3a for pure g c3n4 five absorption regions were visible in its ft ir spectrum the peak at 806 cm 1 was caused by the typical bending vibration of the triazine ring structural unit and the small peak at 887 cm 1 was attributed to the nh bond several strong peaks in the 1200 1700 cm 1 range were ascribed to the cn bond stretching vibration of aromatic rings including n c 3 and c nh c 34 the broad absorption peak in the range of 3000 3600 cm 1 was derived from the nh or oh stretching vibration of free amino or adsorbed water molecules 49 furthermore the catalyst had an absorption peak at 2173 cm 1 corresponding to cn as can be seen in fig 3a the stretching vibration of cn became increasingly obvious and shifted towards higher wavelengths as the amount of fe doping increased which indicated that there was a chemical bond between the fe and n atoms in addition the fe c3n4 composites with different doping contents exhibited similar absorption peaks typical of pure g c3n4 which indicated that the introduction of fe species did not change the chemical skeleton of g c3n4 xrd measurements were used to analyze the crystal phase and crystallinity of the catalyst there were two obvious diffraction peaks in the xrd spectrum of g c3n4 fig 3b indexing to the 100 and 002 crystal planes of g c3n4 jcpds card no 87 1526 44 50 among them the strong diffraction peak of 2θ 26 9 can be attributed to the 002 crystal diffraction plane indicative of the conjugated aromatic ring of g c3n4 and the weak peak at 13 2 was attributed to the in plane repeated tri s thiazine units corresponding to the 100 diffraction plane compared with g c3n4 the diffraction peak positions of the sample doped with fe hardly changed and there was no other fe phase material this indicated that fe ions were successfully anchored to the g c3n4 framework structure possibly by combining with n atoms to form chemical bonds and become fixed on the sheet 30 at the same time with increased fe content the 100 crystal plane gradually disappeared and the 002 crystal plane diffraction peak intensity gradually weakened this illustrated that during the calcination process fe is immobilized in the cn framework forming fe nx coordination bonds that disrupt the periodic arrangement of the basic units in g c3n4 in agreement with previous studies 51 52 however the diffraction peaks of the samples became broader after fe doping the average crystallite size of the samples was estimated by debye scherrer equation and that of g c3n4 5 fe c3n4 10 fe c3n4 20 fe c3n4 and 30 fe c3n4 were 16 48 14 84 14 81 14 25 and 14 08 nm respectively 29 this indicated that the doping of fe will reduce the crystallinity of the sample and the catalyst grains will become smaller the element composition and chemical state of the composites surface were investigated by xps 53 as shown in fig 4 peaks of c n and o were found in the xps spectrum of g c3n4 while peaks of c n o and fe were found in that of fe c3n4 it can be observed that the content of the n element was the highest followed by the c element and the o element was least abundant the trace levels of the o element were attributed to the adsorbed o2 and h2o 54 specific peak information of c 1s n 1s and fe 2p was analyzed as shown in fig 4b d fig 4b shows that the c 1s high resolution spectra were fitted into three characteristic peaks for g c3n4 the three peaks were centered at the binding energies of 284 91 286 41 and 288 51 ev the peak at 284 91 ev was related to the cc bonds of adventitious carbon contamination the peaks at 286 41 and 288 51 ev were assigned to the cn and n 2 c n groups respectively which came from the tri s triazine unit that constitutes the g c3n4 backbone 55 56 the c 1s spectrum of fe c3n4 was similar to that of g c3n4 but with a larger fraction of the cn and n 2 cn groups and their peaks had shifted towards lower binding energies by 0 05 and 0 35 ev respectively these changes might be due to the formation of fe nx bonds when fe was doped into g c3n4 which affected the chemical environment of the adjacent c atoms fig 4c displays the n 1s high resolution spectra of composites for pure g c3n4 the n 1s spectrum can be split into three peaks located at 398 98 400 45 and 401 68 ev respectively among them the strong peak at 398 98 ev corresponded to the sp2 n c n c or pyridine n in the triazine units 57 58 and the peaks at 400 45 and 401 68 ev were attributed to tertiary nitrogen n c 3 or graphite n and amino functional groups c n h respectively 59 60 these three characteristic peaks were also present in the n 1s high resolution spectrum of fe c3n4 these n states constitute the basic unit of g c3n4 indicating that the framework of g c3n4 was unchanged by binding with the fe iii species but the binding energies of these three peaks in the 20 fe c3n4 did have slight shifts compared to pure g c3n4 indicating a change in the chemical state of hybridized n after doping with fe in addition a new peak at about 399 10 ev appeared in the n 1s spectrum of 20 fe c3n4 which corresponded to the fe nx group porphyrin n formed by the chelation of the fe iii center with the n atom 41 fig 4d shows the fe 2p high resolution spectrum the characteristic peaks belonging to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p3 2 can be observed around 710 45 and 723 67 ev respectively in particular the binding energy of fe 2p3 2 was in the range of the fe iii valence 710 3 711 8 ev which was higher than that of fe ii 709 2 ev this indicated that fe iii from fecl3 aqueous solution was not reduced to fe or fe ii during the catalyst preparation but existed as its metal salt phase fe iii which was consistent with the previously published results 33 in addition in the fe 2p spectrum of fe c3n4 no peaks related to zero valent iron were detected suggesting that fe was more likely to bind to pyridine n 40 the above characterization results indicated that fe iii successfully coordinated with n atoms to form fe iii n groups in addition to the two main lines of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 apparent in the figure fe iii satellite peaks also occurred at 714 29 and 728 89 ev xps elemental analysis table s1 showed that the c n ratio of the pure g c3n4 sample was 0 84 close to the theoretical value of 0 75 which indicates that the g c3n4 synthesized in this study has a high degree of graphitization 61 in contrast the actual fe content of 20 fe c3n4 was only 2 11 ωt much less than 20 this was because during the fe c3n4 catalyst preparation the dose ratio is calculated based on the overall molecular weight of the feedstock fecl3 6h2o in addition the specific surface area and pore properties of the as prepared samples were characterized by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig s3 and the results are shown in table s1 the specific surface area of the 20 fe c3n4 was 16 17 m2 g which was slightly smaller than that of pure g c3n4 but it had a higher pore volume and larger pore size this was consistent with the sem and tem observations of large numbers of pore structures on the surface of the samples after fe doping the high pore capacity facilitates the adsorption of contaminants increases the number of active sites and accelerates mass transfer 62 3 2 fenton like activity test the fenton like catalytic performances of different samples were evaluated by mb degradation the catalytic activity of the fe c3n4 samples with different fe doping levels are shown in fig 5a the pure g c3n4 only adsorbed 8 of the mb in solution and could not activate h2o2 to remove mb further in contrast the fe c3n4 composite material could effectively activate h2o2 to degrade mb and the fe doping level had a significant influence on the catalytic activity with the increase of fecl3 6h2o doping ratio from 5 to 20 the h2o2 activation performance of the catalyst continued to improve however as the content of fecl3 6h2o was further increased to 30 catalytic activity decreased indicating that the fecl3 6h2o doping was optimized at 20 when the doping concentration was 20 the fe c3n4 catalyst h2o2 activation performance peaked and the mb removal reached 100 within 60 min as shown in fig s4 solutions colored by mb can be decolorized entirely combined with the characterization results this phenomenon may have two causes 1 the fe doping refines the g c3n4 grains resulting in a rougher catalyst surface and more contact between the contaminants and the catalyst 2 the addition of fe in g c3n4 formed fen bonds which may be fenton like active centers 41 63 there are many similar studies on mb removal al zaban et al synthesized agnps from honey which completely removed mb under sunlight irradiation within 72 h 64 guidolin et al prepared magnetite nanoparticles to remove mb under simulated sunlight which realized the removal efficiency of 93 4 in 210 min by 2 25 g l catalyst and 130 g l h2o2 65 hassani et al synthesized cofe2o4 mpg c3n4 nanocomposite by thermal decomposition which removed 71 64 mb in 120 min under uv irradiation 66 compared with other studies the as prepared 20 fe c3n4 can efficiently activate h2o2 without additional energy and mb can be entirely removed within 60 min with small dosages of catalyst and h2o2 which is more environmentally friendly moreover the toc removal efficiency and mb degradation rate in the system were also carefully investigated as shown in fig s5 about 40 of mb was mineralized to harmless co2 and h2o in the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 catalytic system the kinetics of the degradation reaction were fitted using pseudo first order rate equation fig s6a and the reaction rate constants were calculated fig 5b the results showed that the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 catalytic system not only had the highest degradation efficiency but also the fastest reaction rate therefore follow up experiments were carried out using 20 fe c3n4 five typical mb degradation processes were carried out to further investigate the h2o2 activation capacity of the fe c3n4 composites fig 5c it can be seen that mb removal was negligible when only h2o2 was added which showed that the oxidation capacity of h2o2 itself was not sufficient to remove mb from the wastewater in the absence of h2o2 only the adsorption process occurred and the adsorption desorption equilibrium was reached within 10 min at which point approximately 20 of mb being adsorbed on the fe c3n4 catalyst surface by electrostatic attraction hydrophobic interactions and other forces 67 at the same time in order to confirm that the reaction was a heterogeneous fenton like reaction a catalytic experiment of the eluent was carried out first the 20 fe c3n4 catalyst was dispersed in mb solution without the addition of h2o2 and stirred for 70 min the filtrate was collected at the end of stirring and then 10 mm h2o2 was added into it to initiate the catalytic reaction the results showed that the degradation efficiency of mb was almost zero fig 5c which indicated that h2o2 activation was realized by the fe active site on the catalyst surface rather than the eluted fe ions therefore the h2o2 activation process in the reaction system was typical of a heterogeneous fenton like reaction in addition the influence of h2o2 dosing method on the catalytic activity was investigated one method added h2o2 after the fe c3n4 catalyst adsorption equilibrium i e sectional reaction and the other added the fe c3n4 catalyst and h2o2 at the same time allowing simultaneous adsorption processes i e one stage reaction similar to previous studies the reaction endpoints of the two methods were almost identical and both could completely remove mb within 60 min 68 but the sectional reaction having pre adsorption process exhibited the higher reaction rate as seen in fig 5 d the rate constant of the one stage reaction was 0 068 min 1 while that of the sectional reaction was 0 075 min 1 this may be due to the fact that the contaminants were fully adsorbed on the catalyst surface during pre sorption which effectively facilitate the close contact of the catalyst contaminants and oxidant based on this conclusion the pollutants degradation in the fe c3n4 h2o2 system was achieved through the synergistic effect of adsorption and catalysis in this study the sectional reaction process was chosen for the follow up research in order to eliminate the interference of adsorption and to better reveal the specific mechanism of h2o2 activation by fe c3n4 3 3 optimization of reaction conditions in fenton like reaction system the catalyst dosage the initial concentration of pollutants and h2o2 and the initial solution ph were all critical factors affecting the reaction process therefore the effect of different experimental conditions on the catalytic performance was further investigated fig 6 and the degradation kinetics of different systems were fitted using the pseudo first order equation fig s7 fig 6a displays the effect of catalyst dosage on mb removal the experimental dosages of 20 fe c3n4 ranged from 0 05 to 0 3 g l with the mb concentration fixed at 5 mg l when the dosage of 20 fe c3n4 nanocomposite was 0 05 g l the mb degradation efficiency reached 48 within 60 min and it reached 84 3 when the catalyst concentration was 0 1 g l the reaction time required for complete mb removal became shorter when the catalyst concentration was further increased from 0 1 to 0 15 0 2 or 0 3 g l in addition the degradation rate of mb significantly increased as the catalyst dosage was increased from 0 05 to 0 3 g l with reaction rate constants of 0 010 0 033 0 075 0 099 and 0 125 min 1 respectively this phenomenon can be explained that with the injection of more catalyst more reaction sites and oxidizing species are produced which accelerates the degradation of mb based on the h2o2 concentration 10 mm in the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 system 0 15 g l was determined to be the optimum catalyst dosage in this study except for catalyst dosage the initial concentration of mb was another key factor affecting the activation of h2o2 the effect of the mb concentration on catalytic activity was investigated using mb concentrations ranging from 2 5 to 20 0 mg l fig 6b obviously when the catalyst dosage was fixed the removal of mb decreased with the increase of initial mb concentration at an initial mb concentration of 2 5 mg l the mb was degraded within 45 min while 5 0 mg l mb required 60 min for complete degradation however at initial mb concentrations of 10 0 and 20 0 mg l the mb removal efficiency decreased to 72 3 and 47 8 respectively similar to the degradation efficiency the degradation rate of mb decreased rapidly with increasing initial mb concentration it can be seen that the apparent reaction rate constant was 0 124 min 1 for 2 5 mg l mb but 0 075 0 020 and 0 009 min 1 for the other three concentrations respectively this was because the quantity of free radicals generated in the system is constant when the dosages of catalysts and oxidants are fixed therefore when the initial concentration of mb was too high excess pollutant molecules could not be effectively removed under the same conditions the mb degradation efficiency decreased as its concentration increased fenton like reactions generally utilize ros reactive oxidizing species generated by h2o2 activation to degrade target pollutants in water the amount of oxidant used directly determines the yield of ros thereby influencing the pollutant degradation efficiency the influence of h2o2 concentration on the mb removal efficiency in the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 system is illustrated in fig 6c in this study we used six different h2o2 concentrations i e 2 5 5 0 7 5 10 15 and 20 mm as the h2o2 concentration increased from 2 5 to 10 mm the mb removal efficiency rose from 85 4 to 100 in 60 min and the value of kapp increased rapidly from 0 033 to 0 075 min 1 as expected the mb degradation efficiency and rate increased as the h2o2 concentration went up but when the dosage of h2o2 reached and passed 15 and 20 mm the removal efficiency of mb gradually decreased it could be seen that increasing the concentration of h2o2 initially helped to generate more active free radicals and promote the degradation of mb but excessive h2o2 had a slight inhibitory effect on mb removal this may have been due to the following reasons 1 the quantity of catalyst added into the system was fixed so the limited catalyst could only activate a portion of the h2o2 to generate active free radicals this would explain why increasing the h2o2 concentration from 10 to 20 mm did not improve the mb removal efficiency 2 there was a self quenching effect of h2o2 wherein the excess h2o2 itself produced ineffective decomposition which resulted in a scavenging effect on oh and limited the potential improvement of catalytic efficiency eqs 2 3 69 in order to achieve a balance between cost and efficiency 10 mm h2o2 was selected for subsequent experiments 2 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o 3 ho 2 oh h 2 o o 2 the ph of actual water column varies over a wide range so it is important to characterize the effect of ph on mb removal in the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 system the catalytic activity of 20 fe c3n4 was examined in solutions with different initial ph values 3 to 11 as shown in fig 6d all mb could be completely removed in 60 min at initial ph values ranging from 3 0 to 11 0 the fastest degradation rate occurred in strongly acidic solutions kapp 0 474 min 1 when the ph was 3 0 mb was completely removed within 10 min when the ph was 11 0 mb degradation reached completion in 30 min this may have been because h2o2 was more easily activated under acidic conditions generating more free radicals and promoting the degradation of mb 70 compared with the traditional fenton process which can only achieve high efficiency within a small ph range the fe c3n4 catalyst prepared in this study demonstrated a higher treatment efficiency throughout the ph range of 3 11 this indicates that the immobilization of fe ions on the g c3n4 carrier somewhat weakens the effect of ph on the fenton like system 3 4 environmental application potential 3 4 1 effects of aquatic environmental factors the composition of actual wastewater is complex and the presence of various ions and natural organic matters noms will directly affect how free radicals react during wastewater treatment therefore in order to investigate the effects of inorganic anions and noms on the catalytic activity of the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 system to anticipate the potential of this system in practical applications several typical inorganic salts and humic acids ha were added to the reaction system and the results are presented in fig 7 the mb degradation experiments were performed using the sectional procedure at a concentration of 10 mm inorganic ions compared with mb removal in normal uncontaminated conditions the presence of co3 2 and hco3 had almost no effect on mb removal but so4 2 po4 3 cl and no3 had inhibitory effects of varying degrees fig 7a among them the inhibition by no3 was the most obvious followed by po4 3 cl and so4 2 which reduced the removal efficiency of mb from 100 to 85 87 90 and 95 respectively this was either because 1 these inorganic anions competed with the pollutants for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface and hindered the progress of the catalytic reaction 2 these anions had a quenching effect on the free radicals and converted oh into no3 hocl and other free radicals with weaker oxidizing power eqs 4 5 71 72 4 no 3 oh oh no 3 5 cl oh hocl in the fe c3n4 h2o2 system the addition of ha inhibited the degradation of mb and the inhibition enhanced with increasing ha concentration fig 7b when 10 mg l ha was added to the solution only 72 of mb was degraded there were two possible causes for this result 1 the electron rich groups on the ha competed with pollutants for oh during mb degradation 2 the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of ha were adsorbed on the catalyst surface occupying the reaction sites and reducing the rate of the catalytic reaction 71 73 74 based on the above experimental results despite interference by different kinds of anions and ha the fe c3n4 h2o2 system could still remove mb in a relatively short time therefore the fe c3n4 h2o2 catalytic system has a certain tolerance to interference by the various components of a complex water matrix 3 4 2 reusability and stability of 20 fe c3n4 catalyst the reusability and stability are critical parameters in determining whether catalysts can be applied in the long term therefore a cycling experiment was conducted to investigate the continuous removal effect of mb in the proposed catalytic system as exhibited in fig 8 the activity of the catalyst decreased significantly with successive reactions and the mb removal efficiencies for the first three cycles were 100 74 and 51 respectively this may have been due to two reasons 1 the activity of doped fe decreased as the number of cycles increases 2 more degradation products are generated during the cycling process which may occupy the catalyst surface and hinder the reactions between the catalyst and mb however the catalytic activity of 20 fe c3n4 catalyst can be fully restored by heat treatment under an n2 atmosphere at 550 c this indicated that the intermediate products enriched on the catalyst surface could be effectively removed during the high temperature calcination process in addition the amount of leached fe after the reaction in different ph conditions was determined by icp ms when the initial solution ph was 3 5 86 9 and 11 the concentration of leached fe after reaction was 0 477 0 018 0 012 and 0 005 mg l respectively which are lower than the eu standard 2 mg l 52 except for strong acid conditions the amount of fe leaching was less than 0 02 mg l indicating the high stability of the catalyst therefore it has the potential for applications in complex water environments 75 the above results indicate that the as prepared 20 fe c3n4 catalyst has good economic benefits due to the low catalyst dosage low h2o2 dosage high stability and regenerability 3 5 mechanism of the fenton like system 3 5 1 evaluation of reactive oxidizing species in order to better explain the mechanism of the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 mb system the main active species contributing to mb degradation were investigated using quenching experiments here tert butyl alcohol tba sodium azide nan3 p benzoquinone bq and silver nitrate agno3 were selected as the quenchers of oh 1o2 o2 and e respectively the results showed that tba nan3 and agno3 all had certain inhibitory effects on mb degradation in the 20 fe c3n4 h2o2 system and agno3 had the most pronounced inhibitory effect when an excessive amount of agno3 20 mm was added to the reaction system only 22 8 of the mb was degraded excessive tba n tba h2o2 100 1 and nan3 20 mm reduced the mb degradation efficiency from 100 to 88 and 85 respectively in contrast the addition of 20 mm bq did not affect on mb degradation the quenching experiment showed that e oh and 1o2 play major roles in the degradation of mb in addition the fe nx group was poisoned with potassium thiocyanate kscn to demonstrate that fe nx was the active center of the fenton like reaction 46 after adding 20 mm kscn the degradation efficiency of mb over 60 min decreased from 100 to 70 fig 9 this suggested that fe nx indeed existed in the fe c3n4 composites and was the active center of the fenton like reaction in agreement with the xps analysis to further confirm the reactive oxidizing species generated in this fenton like system electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy was conducted 53 the epr spectra of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo ros adducts and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp ros adducts captured during the reaction are exhibited in fig 10 obviously the addition of fe c3n4 catalyst and h2o2 resulted in an obvious dmpo oh 1 2 2 1 signal peak in the reaction system fig 10a as the reaction proceeded the dmpo oh signal first increased and then decreased slightly however as shown in the epr spectrum in fig 10b no dmpo o2 signal peak was observed at any time during the reaction as for the temp capture agent fig 10c there was already a trilinear mode signal 0 min attributable to temp 1o2 1 1 1 before the addition of fe c3n4 which was probably produced by the reaction between the dissolved oxygen in the water and temp after adding the catalyst the temp 1o2 signal showed a weak increasing trend at first and then a decreasing trend indicating that only a small amount of 1o2 was formed in the system fig 10d therefore when mb is degraded in the fe c3n4 h2o2 system both free radical pathways and non radical pathways are present and electron transfer plays a critical part in the catalytic process 3 5 2 exploration of the reaction mechanism based on the previous results and analysis a probable mechanism for the fe c3n4 h2o2 catalytic system was proposed as reported before in the similar fe c3n4 h2o2 catalytic system fe ii plays the only role for h2o2 activation 40 47 76 however according to the above analysis the doped fe in the as prepared fe c3n4 catalyst only existed as fe iii which is unable to activate h2o2 directly therefore in the proposed fe c3n4 h2o2 system fe iii must be reduced to fe ii at first for initiating the catalytic process as for the transformation process between fe iii and fe ii hu et al found that the ability of metal to capture electrons is related to the magnitude of its work function 77 specifically the greater the work function is the less likely the electrons are to leave the metal according to the references the work function of fe iii is 4 5 ev which indicates it has strong electron capturing ability and can act as an electron acceptor to accelerate the transfer process 77 based on this principle there are three pathways for the transformation of fe iii to fe ii 1 the introduced fe species can make the adjacent c atoms have higher positive charge which facilitates the adsorption of h2o2 63 78 when h2o2 comes into contact with the fe c3n4 catalyst the fe iii nx active sites combines with h2o2 to form a surface complex via the electron transfer process between fe c3n4 and h2o2 fe iii nx is reduced to fe ii nx eq 6 2 the formed fe iii nx active sites have strong electron withdrawing ability which can extract electrons from adjacent c atoms to generate fe ii nx and c eq 7 79 3 thirdly the fe c3n4 composites contain rich pyridine n and graphitic n among them pyridine n owns a large number of solitary electrons and can function as a lewis base to improve the catalytic performance 78 graphite n has a small covalent radius and high electronegativity promoting electron transfer from adjacent c atoms to n atoms 80 subsequently the electrons are further transferred to fe iii through the fe nx bonds promoting the regeneration of fe ii eqs 8 9 6 fe iii nx h 2 o 2 fe ii nx ho 2 h 7 fe iii nx e c fe ii nx c 8 n e c e n c 9 fe iii e n fe ii in order to further verify the electron transfer process of the fe c3n4 catalyst electrochemical experiments were performed chronoamperometric analysis of the fe c3n4 h2o2 catalytic system is shown in fig 11a after adding h2o2 the current density instantly increased from 0 29 to 3 68 μa cm2 indicating that the intense electron transfer process occurred between fe c3n4 and h2o2 which was similar to previous studies 40 but the current density hardly changed when mb was added suggesting that there was no electron transfer between fe c3n4 and mb because mb could not directly obtain electrons from the catalyst it must be degraded by the produced reactive oxidizing species during the h2o2 activation process moreover fig 11b compares the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis of the different catalysts it can be found that the nyquist curve radius of the fe c3n4 catalyst was smaller than that of g c3n4 which indicates fe doping can improve the conductivity of the catalyst 67 after adding h2o2 the radius of the impedance ring slightly increased due to the electrons consuming and fe circulation 47 the above results further confirm that quick transformation from fe iii to fe ii occurs in the reaction process which initiates the fenton like reaction by the fe ii generation oh and 1o2 can be produced specifically fe ii nx reacts quickly with h2o2 to generate large amounts of oh and fe iii then the generated oh attacks the mb molecules decomposing them into small molecular organics even mineralizing into co2 and h2o eqs 10 11 81 in this process the unique defects on the catalyst surface caused by fe doping facilitate the conversion of fe iii nx to fe ii nx therefore the cycle of fe iii fe ii promotes the rapid decomposition of h2o2 improving h2o2 utilization efficiency 10 fe iii nx h 2 o 2 fe ii nx oh oh 11 oh mb degraded or mineralized products in addition the non radical pathway also contributed to mb degradation in the fe c3n4 h2o2 system both quenching experiments and epr analysis confirmed that 1o2 also participated in mb removal process in order to investigate the source of 1o2 and account for the interference by dissolved oxygen the signal of 1o2 was captured in a solution pre saturated with n2 fig 11c it is clear that 1o2 was indeed produced in the fe c3n4 h2o2 system which differed from the traditional o2 induced production method 82 therefore it was concluded that h2o2 was the only source of 1o2 in the fe c3n4 h2o2 system based on the previous studies 1o2 may have been generated via the following pathways firstly ho2 can be produced during the reduction of fe iii to fe ii eqs 5 12 then through ho2 self recombination ho2 and ho reacted or the reaction between ho2 and h2o2 produced 1o2 eqs 13 15 83 86 however because the reaction rate constant between ho2 and h2o2 is only 3 m 1 s 1 which is greatly lower than the rate constants of the other two reactions k13 8 3 105 m 1 s 1 k14 7 1 109 m 1 s 1 its contribution for 1o2 generation was small 84 the specific mechanism diagram is shown in fig 12 12 c h 2 o 2 ho 2 c h 13 ho 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 1 o 2 14 ho 2 oh h 2 o 1 o 2 15 ho 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 o oh 1 o 2 quenching experiments also confirmed this conclusion the activity of fe c3n4 h2o2 fenton like system was significantly reduced after quenching free electrons by agno3 fig 9a which indicates that free electron plays a key role in the formation of reactive species in summary the fe c3n4 h2o2 fenton like system for pollutants degradation operates in both radical and non radical pathways in these processes the formed fe iii nx bond builds a bridge for electron transfer which rapidly transforms into fe ii nx initiating the fenton like reaction to generate oh and 1o2 for pollutants degradation 4 conclusions in this study a high efficiency heterogeneous fe c3n4 catalyst was successfully prepared using a simple high temperature calcination method the introduction of fe into the g c3n4 catalyst obtains a rougher surface a lower crystallinity and a higher pore volume the coordination bond formed between fe iii and pyridine n accelerates electron transfer and realizes the rapid reduction of fe iii to fe ii when the fecl3 6h2o doping concentration is 20 the activation of h2o2 by fe c3n4 is optimized the optimized conditions wherein the mb removal efficiency reached 100 within 60 min were initial mb concentration 5 mg l catalyst dosage 0 15 g l and h2o2 concentration 10 mm compared with the conventional fenton system mentioned in the past the acceptable ph range of the heterogeneous fenton like reaction proposed in this research is greatly expanded furthermore it has a certain tolerance to interference by compounds in the complex water matrix the fe iii nx bond is the active center of this fenton like reaction which prevents the fe from leaching and accelerates electron transfer to form fe ii nx thus activating h2o2 and generating more oh and 1o2 for the efficient degradation of pollutants to sum up as a new heterogeneous fenton like catalyst the emergence of fe c3n4 provides a

13154,antibiotics in the water environment pose harm to animals plants and humans in this study biochar doped with sulfur s nitrogen n and ns was used to adsorb and activate peroxymonosulfate pms to degrade the antibiotics chlortetracycline ofloxacin and sulfadiazine in an aqueous solution the adsorption capacity of the biochar doped with single atoms increased significantly and the maximum saturated adsorption capacities of undoped n doped s doped and ns doped biochar were 40 7 85 5 63 3 and 40 7 mg g respectively the increase in specific surface area and the number of functional groups was the main cause for the increase in the adsorption capacity of heteroatom doped biochar the antibiotic degradation process involved the use of biochar to activate pms and produce reactive oxygen species ros for complete removal the concentration of environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs increased in response to heteroatom doped biochar and the type of epfrs changed which enhanced the ability of biochar to degrade antibiotics at the 500 c preparation temperature the degradation rates of antibiotics by the undoped n doped s doped and ns doped biochar were 73 83 84 32 79 60 and 74 10 respectively whereas the degradation rates at 900 c were 82 38 93 78 91 11 and 81 55 respectively the sulfate radical was produced during the activation process and made the largest relative ros contribution to the increased adsorption capacity followed by singlet oxygen hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical recycling experiments confirmed that the heteroatom doped biochar was highly reusable and that the removal rates of n doped biochar and s doped biochar were high 81 94 and 78 06 respectively graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords heteroatom biochar adsorption degradation antibiotics 1 introduction antibiotics are metabolites or synthetic analogs produced by bacteria molds or other microorganisms 1 they are used in various fields such as agriculture animal husbandry medicine and aquaculture 2 however antibiotics can enter the aquatic environment during use and their concentration in water increases with continued use 3 4 antibiotics persist in water and are difficult to degrade by water self purification 5 the abuse of antibiotics can lead to incurable diseases interfere with the human endocrine system and disrupt normal physiology 6 china is the world s largest producer and user of antibiotics in china the annual output of antibiotics was approximately 2 3 105 tons in 2020 and the average consumption per person was 138 g which is approximately three times that observed for europeans and americans 7 antibiotics persist in surface water where they can harm aquatic life therefore developing efficient approaches to treat antibiotics is a major focus of research corn is one of the world s most important food crops and corncobs are a major agricultural waste 8 corncobs have no edible value and are often disposed of carelessly 9 thus corncobs are a waste of biological resources thus there is a need to develop efficient ways to utilize corncobs biochar is usually prepared from raw materials with high biomass content such as agricultural waste excess sludge and animal waste 10 therefore crushed corncobs and pyrolysis can be used to produce biochar at high temperatures biochar has lower production costs and can be prepared more simply with a wider variety of raw materials than activated carbon 11 current studies are focused on optimizing the biochar preparatory conditions to replace activated carbon adsorption and degradation are the two processes used by biochar to remove pollutants from an aqueous solution 12 adsorption is mediated by the adsorption sites on the surface of the biochar 13 most research on increasing the adsorption capacity of biochar has focused on increasing the number of functional groups and the specific surface area of the biochar 14 the adsorption capacity of biochar can be greatly enhanced by increasing temperature because the specific surface area of the biochar increases rapidly with temperature 15 however the specific surface area of pristine biochar does not increase significantly with temperature increases thus there is still room for improving the preparation of pristine biochar biochar also degrades organic pollutants by activating oxidants hydrogen peroxide persulfate and o2 to produce reactive oxygen species ros 15 among them peroxymonosulfate pms has become the most commonly used oxidant because of its high efficiency low cost and lack of secondary pollution 16 in addition the activated sulfate radical so4 lasts longer than the hydroxyl radical oh and can adapt to a wider ph range in an aqueous solution 17 the main degradation process of organic pollutants by pristine biochar is through the use of environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs and the defect structure of biochar to activate the oxidants 18 epfrs form a stable structure with a transition metal and transfer electrons to oxidants to produce instant free radicals 19 previous studies have suggested that epfrs play a dominant role in the degradation of organic pollutants when the preparation temperature is 300 500 c and the defect structure plays a dominant role when the preparation temperature is 600 c 20 the catalytic effect is even greater when the preparation temperature of the biochar is 900 c 7 because of the presence of pores in biochar in addition the continuous increase in temperature results in the formation of pores and catalytic active sites and the high temperature does not collapse the pores the ros produced include so4 oh and o2 21 the ability of pristine biochar to degrade organic pollutants can be improved biochar must be modified for its adsorption and degradation capacity to improve because biochar is used to remove water pollutants non toxic materials that do not lead to secondary pollution should be used for the process the heteroatom doping of nitrogen n and sulfur s in common organic reagents has received increasing interest from researchers 22 heteroatom doping involves mixing urea sodium thiosulfate thiourea and other common forms of organic matter with biomass to prepare heteroatom doped biochar containing n or s through pyrolysis or a hydrothermal process 23 this modification significantly improves the specific surface area of biochar and enhances the number of functional groups the preparation process of heteroatom doped biochar by hydrothermal carbonization pyrolysis provides more functional groups and active sites to degrade organic pollutants 24 in addition the degradation capacity of heteroatom doped biochar improves because n atoms replace c atoms and s atoms replace o atoms in the network structure thus altering the internal structure 25 however no consensus exists regarding the effect of s doping on the biochar degradation rate 23 in addition n and s doping alter the structure of the biochar and may increase the role of non free radical pathways in the degradation process 26 this change in the relative contribution of free radical and non free radical pathways to degradation may have a substantial effect on the degradation process therefore the efficiency and mechanism of antibiotic adsorption and degradation by n or s doped biochar require further study in this study heteroatom doped n doped nbc s doped sbc and ns doped nsbc biochars were prepared from corncobs to adsorb and degrade ofloxacin ofx chlorotetracycline ctc and sulfadiazine sdz at different temperatures the main objectives of this study were to 1 optimize the adsorption parameters and analyze the adsorption capacity of the heteroatom doped biochars 2 compare the degradation efficiency of antibiotics by nbc sbc and nsbc by activating pms at different preparation temperatures and 3 characterize the mechanism of adsorption specific surface area vs functional groups and the degradation process free radical

hydrochar samples 220 c were placed in a tube furnace for three n2 vacuum cycles and then pyrolyzed at 300 900 c for 2 h the biochar samples corresponding to different preparation temperatures were

antibiotics by the heteroatom doped biochar in this study a typical antibiotic sdz was used to study the adsorption process of the heteroatom doped biochar the adsorption of sdz by the heteroatom doped biochar was optimized by testing a variety of ph values dosages and contact times the concentration of sdz was 30 mg l the dosages tested were 1 2 3 4 and 5 g l 1 the ph values tested were 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 and the contact times tested were 1 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 min the ph of the solution was adjusted with 1 mol hcl and 1 mol naoh the prepared sdz solution was added to a 100 ml triangular flask containing biochar 4 ml of anhydrous ethanol was added and the mixture was placed in a thermostatic oscillator for 50 min after the reaction the mixture was filtered through a 0 22 μm

study degradation of the heteroatom doped biochar the process of antibiotic degradation by the heteroatom doped biochar was as follows first 20 mg l ofx ctc and sdz were added with 3 g l 1 biochar and 5 mmol l 1 pms to a 100 ml triangle flask which was placed in a thermostatic oscillator and oscillated for 15 30 min without adjusting the ph the nbc reaction was run for 15 min and the reactions with bc sbc and nsbc were run for 30 min after the reaction the mixed liquor was filtered through a 0 22 μm microporous membrane all samples were measured at an interval of 2 or 5 min to calculate the apparent rate constant kobs of the degradation of the antibiotic by the biochar the free radical inhibitors during the degradation process were etoh tba bq and ffa which inhibited oh and so4 oh o2 and

milford ma usa system was used with a wondasil c18 column to separate the organic compounds the detection wavelength for ctc was 365 nm and methanol water v v 67 33 was added the detection wavelength

of 1 0 ml min and a column temperature of 30 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the heteroatom doped biochar scanning electron microscopy sem revealed many holes on the surface of the biochar and the fibrous structure of the plant was evident fig 1 after heteroatom doping the surface structure of the biochar was smoother the surface layer was covered with the doping reagent but the pore structure on the surface could still be seen indicating that the surface structure of the doped biochar was clear biochar doped with na2s2o3 had a rod like crystal structure on its surface indicating that the inorganic salts had been successfully loaded onto the surface of the biochar 27 sem showed that the heteroatom doping effect was pronounced and the surface changes in the biochar could be seen table s1 shows that the specific surface area of the biochar prepared by high temperature pyrolysis of the biomass increased significantly by 30 1 336 2 times the specific surface areas of bc nbc sbc and nsbc were 84 93 345 03 205 34 466 74 195 88 404 61 and 45 85 198 94 m2 g 1 at the preparation temperatures of 500 700 and 900 c respectively this result indicates that the doping of n or s had a positive effect on the structure of the biochar by increasing the specific surface area and providing more favorable conditions for subsequent adsorption and degradation however the specific surface area of the ns doped biochar was lower than that of the undoped biochar suggesting that ns doping may not enhance adsorption or antibiotic degradation by the biochar when the preparation temperature was 500 700 and 900 c the total pores of bc nbc sbc and nsbc were 0 0562 0 1464 0 0853 0 1969 0 0813 0 1678 and 0 0304 0 0828 cm3 g 1 respectively the change in the total pores was consistent with the change in specific surface area nbc had the most pores and nsbc had the fewest number of pores the average pore size range of the three types of biochar was 1 39 2 67 nm the average pore size of the biochar was inversely related to the specific surface area table s2 reveals that the n content of nbc was 1 93 which was similar to bc 1 19 this result indicates that a small amount of additional n significantly improved the adsorption and degradation capacity of the biochar after s doping s content increased significantly to 5 796 in sbc which was significantly higher than that of bc s 0 183 and nsbc s 0 972 this finding indicates that a greater amount of s was successfully doped into the biochar which could be used to effectively adsorb and degrade the antibiotics the id ig value showed that the defect structure of nbc and sbc was slightly enhanced and the id ig value of nsbc was consistent with that of bc indicating that the catalytic degradation performance of nbc and sbc could be superior to that of nsbc fig 2a in general the id ig value indicates the strength of the defect structure of the biochar the ratio of large defects is strong and the ratio of small defects is weak 19 therefore id ig reflects the catalytic ability of biochar to degrade organic pollutants the thermogravimetric analysis indicated a large difference between the corncobs and the corncob biochar fig 2b the weight of the corncobs decreased rapidly after heating from 0 to 400 c the mass loss was 75 72 when the preparation temperature reached 500 c nbc also had a greater mass loss this was likely explained by the fact that na2s2o3 salt reagent was used for s doping which remains on the surface and pores of the biochar after doping the residual reagent volatilizes and disappears when heated to 650 c resulting in the high mass loss 31 75 the weight losses of bc nbc and sbc remained more or less constant 15 this can be explained by the fact that the n doping and s doping reagents are organic reagents which do not remain on the surface of the biochar during the doping process consequently the mass loss after pyrolysis was the same as that of bc based on the organic element analysis the amount of s doped in sbc was much higher than that of the other heteroatom doped biochar samples and the specific surface area increased indicating that inorganic salt and organic reagents can be used for heteroatom doping fig 1c shows that the characteristic peaks of the heteroatom doped biochar were the ch bond at 649 cm 1 the c o c bond at 1124 cm 1 and the co bond at 1607 cm 1 in addition the cs bond 653 cm 1 appeared in the 720 622 cm 1 region for sbc and nsbc 28 the characteristic peaks at 2929 cm 1 and 3446 cm 1 corresponded to ch2 and oh respectively the oh stretching vibrations decreased slightly after pyrolysis of the biochar a new band appeared at 2343 cm 1 after heteroatom doping corresponding to cn for nbc and nsbc the emergence of new peaks also indicated that n was successfully doped into the biochar various characterization methods revealed that the physical and chemical properties of the biochar doped with heteroatoms improved in particular the increase in the surface area and the number of new functional groups after doping improved antibiotic adsorption and degradation by the biochar 3 2 optimization of the adsorption parameters and model analysis the ph of the solution the dosage of the adsorbent and the contact time are important parameters affecting the efficacy of the adsorption of pollutants by biochar we optimized the adsorption process by identifying the optimal parameters fig 3a shows that the optimal ph for adsorbing sdz by all biochars was 7 and the ph gradually decreased from 3 to 5 when the ph was 6 it began to rise gradually and reached a maximum of 7 it then decreased rapidly from 7 to 9 fig 2b shows that the isoelectric points of bc nbc sbc and nsbc were 2 21 2 03 1 92 and 2 14 respectively the isoelectric points of several of the biochars were similar indicating that the isoelectric point changes little after heteroatomic doping sdz assumes different forms ionizing or neutral at different ph values which is related to the ionization constant pka the dissociation constant pka of sdz is 6 48 and the adsorption effect of sdz was highest when the sdz dissociation constant was close to this value 29 the optimal dosage for sdz adsorption by all biochars was 3 g l 1 fig 3c the optimal adsorption rates of bc nbc sbc and nsbc for the antibiotics were 59 76 70 26 65 15 and 50 66 respectively the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e corresponding to the optimal removal rates of sdz by bc nbc sbc and nsbc were 7 32 8 02 7 68 and 6 71 mg g 1 respectively the q e of the adsorbent for sdz decreased rapidly when the dosage was increased from 1 to 5 g l 1 q e decreased after the dosage was increased because an increase in dosage does not mean that the adsorbent can efficiently adsorb all pollutants thus many adsorbents have a blocking and shielding effect between adsorption sites which affects the adsorption rate 30 fig 3d shows that the biochar and heteroatom doped biochar reach the adsorption equilibrium within 30 min the q e of nbc was the highest 8 07 mg g 1 followed by sbc 7 66 mg g 1 bc 7 28 mg g 1 and nsbc 6 67 mg g 1 the adsorption curves of the several types of heteroatom doped biochar on sdz over time were consistent however the adsorption rate differed but the change in the removal rate was consistent with the findings described above the optimal adsorption parameters for sdz were ph of 7 dosage of 3 g l 1 and contact time of 30 min the microstructural characterization and adsorption data of the heteroatom doped biochar showed that the adsorption of sdz mainly depended on the interaction between the surface functional groups and specific surface area 3 3 antibiotic adsorption model for the heteroatom doped biochar 3 3 1 adsorption isothermal model adsorption plays an important role during the removal of an antibiotic by heteroatom doped biochar the data were further analyzed using the langmuir and freundlich isothermal adsorption models 31 the langmuir model is used to describe the adsorption of a monomolecular layer and to calculate the maximum saturated adsorption capacity of the adsorbent which is useful to evaluate the potential of the adsorbent 3 q e b q m c e 1 b c e eq 3 is the langmuir isothermal model and its linear form is 4 1 q e 1 q m 1 c e b q m where b is the sdz equilibrium adsorption coefficient l mg 1 q m is the maximum saturated adsorption capacity mg g 1 q e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g 1 and c e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg l 1 the freundlich model is used to determine whether antibiotic adsorption by the adsorbent is multi molecular layer adsorption and the detailed equation is as follows 5 q e k f c e 1 n 6 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where k f is the adsorption coefficient related to adsorption capacity mg g 1 l mg 1 l n table 1 shows the sdz adsorption data for all of the biochars the langmuir model average r2 0 9970 was a better fit for the adsorption of sdz by the heteroatom doped biochar than the freundlich model average r2 0 9741 based on the experimental data calculated with the langmuir model the q m values were 40 7 bc 85 5 nbc 63 3 sbc and 22 1 mg g 1 nsbc on the one hand the langmuir model shows that the adsorption of sdz by the heteroatom doped biochar was a monomolecular adsorption process on the other hand the langmuir model was also useful to evaluate the adsorption potential of the adsorbent using the maximum saturated adsorption capacity table s3 shows that sdz adsorption capacity was better than that of the other adsorbents using the heteroatom doped corncob biochar n or s doped biochar was superior to pristine biochar but the q m was slightly lower for the pristine biochar than organically modified biochar in addition the heteroatom doped biochar is more economical and environmentally friendly the q m of pristine biochar was low and the q m of modified biochar was large indicating that biochar still has much room for improvement 3 3 2 adsorption kinetic model the adsorption kinetics were examined and the reaction process was characterized in addition the rate limiting steps were determined and the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were established 32 the pseudo first order kinetic model was 7 log q e 1 q t log q e 1 k 1 t 2 303 where q t is the equilibrium adsorption capacity at time t mg g 1 q e1 is the theoretical adsorption capacity mg g 1 and k 1 is a constant the pseudo second order kinetic model was formulated as follows 8 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 2 t q e 2 where k 2 is the constant of the pseudo second order kinetic model table 2 shows the adsorption kinetics model of the heteroatom doped biochar for the adsorption of antibiotics the q e1 cal of the pseudo first order kinetic model differed from the experimentally measured q e exp value and the r2 was 0 8577 0 9914 the correlation coefficient and equilibrium adsorption capacity indicated that the pseudo first order kinetics model was not suitable to fit the adsorption data this model was only useful for describing the initial stage of antibiotic adsorption and could not be used to describe the entire adsorption process the average r2 of the pseudo second order kinetic model was 0 9996 and the qe1 was close to the qe exp which could be used to describe the entire adsorption process therefore the pseudo second order kinetic model was more suitable than the pseudo first order kinetic model for the adsorption of antibiotics by the heteroatom doped biochar overall the pseudo first order kinetic model was useful for describing the initial stage of adsorption and the pseudo second order kinetic model was useful for describing the entire adsorption process almost all of the adsorption processes were consistent with the latter 3 3 3 adsorption thermodynamic parameters the gibbs function δg 0 value indicates whether a reaction occurs spontaneously under certain conditions reactions generally occur spontaneously when δg 0 0 in addition enthalpy is an endothermic reaction when δh 0 0 but an exothermic reaction when δh 0 0 9 δ g 0 rt ln k d 10 ln k d δ s 0 r δ h 0 rt 11 k d q e c e 12 δ g 0 δ h 0 t δ s 0 where r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k and k d is a constant table 3 shows that the adsorption of antibiotics by the heteroatom doped biochar was exothermic and the δh 0 values were 8 15 10 17 17 01 and 14 69 kj mol 1 for bc nbc sbc and nsbc respectively the entropy value δs 0 is a physical quantity of the disorder of matter δg 0 was 0 during the entire adsorption process indicating that the adsorption of antibiotics by the heteroatom doped biochar proceeded spontaneously 3 4 change of the epfrs in the heteroatom doped biochar epfrs were generated during preparation of the heteroatom doped biochar and played an important role in activating pms to produce ros particularly at the preparation temperatures of 300 500 c fig 4 shows the epfr signal generated in the heteroatom doped biochar at preparation temperatures of 300 500 c epfr signal intensity gradually increased as the preparation temperature was increased table 4 shows that the concentrations of the epfrs were the highest when the preparation temperature of the heteroatom doped biochar was 500 c and their concentrations in bc 500 nbc 500 sbc 500 and nsbc 500 were 7 96 1018 3 19 1019 2 11 1019 and 4 58 1018 spin g 1 respectively at a lower preparation temperature 300 c the concentrations of epfrs in bc 300 nbc 300 sbc 300 and nsbc 300 were 3 28 1018 8 35 1018 6 77 1019 and 2 16 1018 spin g 1 respectively the concentrations of the epfrs produced by the biochar through n and s doping also increased indicating that the catalytic degradation of antibiotics by biochar could be improved by single element doping a positive correlation has been reported between the concentrations of epfrs and the degradation efficiency of antibiotics 28 therefore heteroatom doping enhances the degradation of antibiotics by biochar except for ns doped biochar in addition epfrs were not be detected at 600 or 700 c indicating that epfrs decompose gradually when the temperature is higher the decomposition temperature of the biochar prepared from different types of biomass varied slightly but the decomposition temperature was usually 600 c the type of epfr is also important for the catalytic degradation of antibiotics the g factors determine the epfr species which are usually divided into three types carbon centered free radicals g1 2 0030 carbon centered radicals with oxygen atoms 2 0030 g2 2 0040 and oxygen centered free radicals g3 2 0040 table 4 shows the changes in the g factor for the epfrs produced by the heteroatom doped biochar the g factor decreased as preparation temperature was increased when the preparation temperature was 300 c g1 type epfrs were dominant in the heteroatom doped biochar and the g2 type epfrs were dominant in bc this was explained by the increase in oxygen containing functional groups in the biochar after heteroatom doping consistent with the results of the organic element analysis section 3 1 an increase in the oxygen content changed the type of epfr the g3 type epfr was dominant at 300 c whereas the g2 type epfrs were dominant in bc and nsbc when the temperature reached 400 c nbc and sbc had low g factors of 2 0032 0 0002 and 2 0031 0 0001 respectively although g2 type epfrs were present in nbc and sbc at this temperature their g factors were close to 2 0030 suggesting the presence of g1 type epfrs when the preparation temperature was increased to 500 c the g factors of the four types of biochar continued to decrease and carbon centered free radicals became dominant g1 2 0030 oxygen centered free radicals carbon centered radicals with oxygen atoms and carbon centered free radicals were the dominant epfrs at preparation temperatures of 300 400 and 500 c respectively however only the g2 and g1 type epfrs were observed in bc when the preparation temperature was 300 500 c this finding indicates that the species of epfr became richer after heteroatom doping and included all three types of epfrs carbon centered radicals were dominant in nbc and sbc g factor close to 2 0030 when the preparation temperature was 400 c most studies have suggested that carbon centered free radicals are potentially more active thus they may improve the ability of biochar to degrade antibiotics 33 the increase in carbon centered free radicals may also improve the ability of biochar to degrade antibiotics 34 the epfrs and the degradation ability of biochar were maximized when the preparation temperature of the heteroatom doped biochar reached 500 c no signals were detected in the epfrs of biochar at 600or 700 c and the epfrs decomposed rapidly when the preparation temperature was 500 c 3 5 degradation of antibiotics by the heteroatom doped biochar 3 5 1 degradation of antibiotics by the heteroatom doped biochar at different preparation temperatures no less than 50 of the sdz c 0 30 mg l 1 was adsorbed by the heteroatom doped biochar based on the results of the adsorption experiment the initial concentration of 20 mg l was used to degrade the antibiotics sdz ctc and ofx fig 5 shows the degradation rates of the three antibiotics by all of the biochars at preparation temperatures from 300to 900 c the adsorption data are provided in fig s1 changes in the degradation rate of the antibiotics were divided into three parts the first process occurred from 300 to 500 c and the removal rate increased gradually over this temperature range the removal rate of antibiotics was highest for nbc followed by sbc nsbc and bc the average removal rates of antibiotics by nbc sbc nsbc and bc at 500 c were 84 32 79 60 74 10 and 73 83 respectively the improvement in the degradation rate of antibiotics was attributed to the action of epfrs the mineralization rate of antibiotics ranged from 36 9 to 43 44 and the mineralization rate increased as the degradation rate increased fig s2a thus less than half of the antibiotics were completely degraded into co2 h2o and other inorganic substances e g f or cl during the degradation process the continuous increase in the degradation rate of antibiotics originated from the rapid increase in the concentration of epfrs in the biochar as the preparation temperature was increased the epfrs activated pms and quickly produced ros to degrade the antibiotics higher concentrations of epfrs resulted in a greater amount of ros and thus a higher degradation rate the second process occurred from 500 to 600 c and the removal rate sharply decreased over this temperature range the removal rates of the antibiotics by nbc sbc nsbc and bc at 600 c were 70 71 67 80 62 84 and 65 13 respectively the removal rate of antibiotics decreased by 11 34 on average at 600 c compared with that at 500 c this can be explained by the rapid decomposition of epfrs leading to a reduction in the activation efficiency of pms which cannot produce sufficient ros to degrade the antibiotics therefore the removal rate of antibiotics may be positively correlated with the concentration of epfrs the third process occurred from 600 to 900 c and the removal rate increased gradually to its maximum value the removal rates of nbc sbc nsbc and bc at 900 c were 93 78 91 11 81 55 and 82 38 respectively the toc of the antibiotics at 900 c was 48 95 and nearly half of the antibiotics were completely degraded fig s2b the toc value of the antibiotics via heteroatom doped biochar degradation was high compared to other advanced oxidation technologies at this stage the epfrs were completely decomposed but the biochar can still activate pms to produce ros and degrade antibiotics this is because the defect structure of the biochar became more pronounced as the preparation temperature was increased and the defect structure activated pms to produce ros to degrade the antibiotics when the temperature reached 900 c the disappearance of the epfrs did not reduce the removal rate of the antibiotics and the removal rate continued to increase however the high temperature of 900 c did not result in the collapse of internal pores in the biochar but increased the specific surface area this is because the internal pores of the biochar were well developed and high temperatures further increased the number of internal pores the removal rates of antibiotics in the three types of heteroatom doped biochar from large to small were nbc sbc and nsbc the results of the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis are shown in fig 6 the xps analysis showed that the proportion of graphite n was high in nbc 68 8 and nsbc 70 3 graphite n directly affects the degradation efficiency of antibiotics 35 the contents of pyridine n in nbc and nsbc were 18 7 and 23 5 respectively the contents of pyrrole n in nbc and nsbc were 12 5 and 6 2 respectively the effects of pyridine n and pyrrole n on the degradation of antibiotics by the heteroatom doped biochar were weaker than those of graphite n the percentage of c s c in sbc 19 0 and nsbc 38 1 differed the c s c bond is the sbc active group and the higher content in biochar results in higher catalytic activity for antibiotic degradation 23 however the antibiotic degradation rate was lower by nsbc than by sbc this may be explained by the fact that both n and s occur in nsbc and their combined action may have affected the biochar active sites in addition nsbc had the lowest specific surface area which might also explain its low efficiency in antibiotic degradation the content of the c sox c group in sbc was high and s and o form this group this is consistent with the results of the organic element analysis section 3 1 o content increased significantly in sbc because of the c sox c group in general the heteroatom doped biochar had the highest antibiotic degradation rate at 500 c average r 77 and 900 c average r 87 epfrs played a major role in the degradation process when the preparation temperature was 500 c whereas the defect structure played a major role in the degradation process at 900 c nbc and sbc had the highest antibiotic degradation efficiency and nsbc had the lowest indicating that doping of a single element n or s is more conducive to improving the catalytic performance of biochar whereas ns doping had the opposite effect 3 5 2 apparent rate constant of antibiotic degradation by the heteroatom doped biochar the rate at which the heteroatom doped biochar degrades antibiotics is important and the degradation data were further analyzed by the apparent rate constant kobs fig 7 shows the antibiotic degradation efficiency by the heteroatom doped biochar within 30 min sbc nsbc and bc reached a balance in degradation at 30 min and the removal rate of antibiotics by nbc reached an average of 93 78 in 12 min the average degradation rates of the antibiotics by bc nbc and sbc were 91 11 81 55 and 82 38 in 30 min respectively the degradation efficiency of nbc was higher than that of the other types of heteroatom doped biochar and 90 of the antibiotics were completely degraded within a short period demonstrating that nbc is effective for degrading antibiotics table 5 shows the kobs values of antibiotic degradation by the heteroatom doped biochar according to the kobs values the antibiotic degradation efficiency was much higher by nbc followed by sbc the antibiotic degradation efficiency of nsbc and bc did not differ the kobs analysis showed that the efficiency of antibiotic degradation improved by nbc and sbc but the degradation process was not greatly affected by nsbc nbc degraded more than 90 of the antibiotics in 12 min which was much more efficient than bc 3 6 free radical and non free radical reactions of the heteroatom doped biochar 3 6 1 contribution of different ros to degradation the ros produced by the heteroatom doped biochar after activating pms included so4 oh o2 and 1o2 ros vary in their ability to degrade antibiotics determining the contribution of ros is important when analyzing the degradation mechanism in control experiments etoh tba tempol and ffa were used to inhibit so4 oh oh o2 and 1o2 respectively 36 fig 8 shows that the antibiotic removal rate by the heteroatom doped biochar decreased sharply when so4 and oh were inhibited the antibiotic degradation rates by nbc sbc nsbc and bc were 45 40 37 44 30 93 and 31 49 respectively the degradation rate was nearly 50 lower after ethanol was added compared to before ethanol was added indicating that so4 and oh play a dominant role in antibiotic degradation the degradation rate did not decrease significantly after adding tba to inhibit oh and the average antibiotic degradation rates by nbc sbc nsbc and bc decreased by 12 55 11 86 11 34 and 12 14 respectively this result suggests that so4 is a major contributor to antibiotic degradation compared to oh 37 the antibiotic degradation rate decreased by less than 5 when o2 was inhibited indicating that o2 had little effect on antibiotic degradation finally inhibiting 1o2 by adding ffa significantly decreased the antibiotic degradation rate by the heteroatom doped biochar however the antibiotic degradation rates by bc after adding ffa only decreased by 7 00 5 31 and 5 55 compared to before ffa was added respectively indicating that 1o2 had little effect on antibiotic degradation by bc heteroatom doping may alter the mechanism of antibiotic degradation by biochar and the increase in the non free radical pathway 1o2 may be one of the main reasons for the increase in the antibiotic degradation rate 38 the effect of different ros on antibiotic degradation was verified by the control experiments in which different inhibitors were added the ros with the strongest ability to inhibit the degradation rate was so4 followed by 1o2 oh and o2 1o2 contributed little to the degradation rate by bc 3 6 2 intermediate antibiotic products during degradation the degradation intermediates of all antibiotics were measured by liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy bruker ultimate 3000 and the corresponding spectrum is shown in fig s3 table 6 shows that ofx ctc and sdz consisted of five five and three types of intermediate products respectively the m z values of the ctc intermediates were 274 9 217 1 165 0 122 9 and 150 0 the m z values of the ofx intermediates were 354 8 348 8 341 2 300 8 and 322 8 and the m z values of the sdz intermediates were 217 1 186 6 and 96 1 antibiotics were degraded by the heteroatom doped biochar and gradually decomposed into small molecules such as co2 and h2o 39 other inorganic substances such as f or cl were also observed 3 7 mechanism of antibiotic degradation by the heteroatom doped biochar and the antibiotic intermediates the heteroatom doped biochar directly adsorbed the antibiotics on the surface this process mainly takes advantage of the large specific surface area and functional groups the epfrs quickly activated the pms to produce instant radicals when pms was added as shown in eqs 13 16 including so4 oh and o2 the so4 oh o2 and 1o2 signals are shown in fig 9 the earliest activation of pms by the heteroatom doped biochar produces so4 which rapidly degraded the antibiotics so4 was metabolized into oh in the presence of h2o and oh subsequently oh began to degrade the antibiotics according to the analysis in section 3 6 1 the contribution rate of oh to antibiotic degradation was lower than that of so4 when dissolved oxygen is present in the water the epfrs provide electrons to o2 molecules to produce o2 however the contribution of o2 was small throughout the control experiment and the antibiotics were not degraded by o2 epfrs play a major role in the preparation of heteroatom doped biochar at 300 500 c 15 13 nbc or sbc pms epfr s s o 4 14 s o 4 h 2 o hs o 4 oh 15 s o 4 o h s o 4 2 oh 16 nbc sbc o 2 epfr s o 2 in addition to these free radical pathways non free radical pathways occurred in the antibiotic degradation system of the heteroatom doped biochar the control experiment showed that 1o2 contributed significantly to antibiotic degradation the non free radical pathway was more significant in the degradation process in the heteroatom doped biochar than bc in the non free radical pathway pms was further decomposed to 1o2 or directly receives electrons from the antibiotics to degrade them 40 17 hs o 5 s o 5 2 s o 4 2 hs o 4 o 1 2 according to the analysis of the variation in the degradation rate at different temperatures section 3 5 1 the ability of the heteroatom doped biochar to degrade antibiotics improved significantly when the preparation temperature was 700 c and reached a maximum value at 900 c the improvement in the antibiotic degradation rate was attributed to the enhancement of the defect structure of the heteroatom doped biochar raman spectroscopy is the most intuitive approach for characterizing the structure of biochar the raman spectra of biochar prepared at temperatures of 500 700 and 900 c and the data are provided in fig s4 a comparison of the raman spectra of the heteroatom doped biochar at different preparation temperatures revealed that the id ig value increased indicating that the defect structure gradually became more pronounced as the temperature was increased the defect structure of biochar also activated pms to produce ros and degrade the antibiotics therefore the defect structure of biochar is the main factor mediating antibiotic degradation at higher preparation temperatures at preparation temperatures of 300 500 c epfrs play a major role in activating pms whereas the defect structure is dominant in the free radical pathway after 700 c the non free radical pathway of antibiotic degradation by biochar was enhanced after heteroatom doping 1o2 is a major contributor to antibiotic degradation in the non free radical pathway 3 8 reusability of the heteroatom doped biochar the reusability of biochar is another important criterion for evaluating the degradation of organic pollutants nbc and sbc which had the greatest degradation effects were used in five cycles of antibiotic degradation fig 10 shows that the removal rates of the antibiotics degraded by bc nbc and sbc decreased by 19 26 11 58 and 9 24 respectively after five cycles this result indicates that heteroatom doped biochar has high reusability and its overall effect was superior to that of undoped biochar despite the decrease in the removal rate after five cycles the overall removal rate of the heteroatom doped biochar remained high 81 94 and 78 06 for nbc and sbc respectively compared to the undoped biochar 63 30 thus the persistence of biochar utilization increased to a certain extent after heteroatom doping the reduction in the removal rate mainly stemmed from the consumption of active surface sites and the oxidation of the defect structure which reduced the catalytic degradation ability of antibiotics by biochar 16 in general heteroatom doped biochar has high reusability which reduces costs and improves the utilization of biochar 4 conclusion in this study typical antibiotics were removed by heteroatom doped biochar prepared from corncobs the adsorption and degradation of antibiotics improved in response to the heteroatom doped biochar the adsorption capacity of nbc or sbc increased because of the increase in specific surface area and the number of functional groups the maximum saturated adsorption capacities of nbc and sbc were 85 5 and 63 3 mg g 1 which were higher than those of bc 22 10 mg g 1 and nsbc 22 10 mg g 1 all biochar adsorbed antibiotics were consistent with the langmuir model and quasi second order kinetic model and the reaction was exothermic the main role of heteroatom doped biochar is to generate ros to degrade antibiotics by activating pms during degradation the concentration of epfrs increased after heteroatom doping and the type of epfr changed single atom doping greatly improved the efficiency of antibiotic degradation so4 played a major role in the free radical pathway of antibiotic degradation by the heteroatom doped biochar followed by oh and o2 the heteroatom doping of biochar enhanced the non free radical pathway and 1o2 was the major contributor to antibiotic degradation in the non free radical pathway antibiotics were degraded by the heteroatom doped biochar and eventually formed co2 and h2o as well as other inorganic substances f or cl the reuse experiment confirmed that the heteroatom doped biochar degraded antibiotics efficiently after five cycles overall heteroatom doping improved the range of biochar applications declaration of

13154,antibiotics in the water environment pose harm to animals plants and humans in this study biochar doped with sulfur s nitrogen n and ns was used to adsorb and activate peroxymonosulfate pms to degrade the antibiotics chlortetracycline ofloxacin and sulfadiazine in an aqueous solution the adsorption capacity of the biochar doped with single atoms increased significantly and the maximum saturated adsorption capacities of undoped n doped s doped and ns doped biochar were 40 7 85 5 63 3 and 40 7 mg g respectively the increase in specific surface area and the number of functional groups was the main cause for the increase in the adsorption capacity of heteroatom doped biochar the antibiotic degradation process involved the use of biochar to activate pms and produce reactive oxygen species ros for complete removal the concentration of environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs increased in response to heteroatom doped biochar and the type of epfrs changed which enhanced the ability of biochar to degrade antibiotics at the 500 c preparation temperature the degradation rates of antibiotics by the undoped n doped s doped and ns doped biochar were 73 83 84 32 79 60 and 74 10 respectively whereas the degradation rates at 900 c were 82 38 93 78 91 11 and 81 55 respectively the sulfate radical was produced during the activation process and made the largest relative ros contribution to the increased adsorption capacity followed by singlet oxygen hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical recycling experiments confirmed that the heteroatom doped biochar was highly reusable and that the removal rates of n doped biochar and s doped biochar were high 81 94 and 78 06 respectively graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords heteroatom biochar adsorption degradation antibiotics 1 introduction antibiotics are metabolites or synthetic analogs produced by bacteria molds or other microorganisms 1 they are used in various fields such as agriculture animal husbandry medicine and aquaculture 2 however antibiotics can enter the aquatic environment during use and their concentration in water increases with continued use 3 4 antibiotics persist in water and are difficult to degrade by water self purification 5 the abuse of antibiotics can lead to incurable diseases interfere with the human endocrine system and disrupt normal physiology 6 china is the world s largest producer and user of antibiotics in china the annual output of antibiotics was approximately 2 3 105 tons in 2020 and the average consumption per person was 138 g which is approximately three times that observed for europeans and americans 7 antibiotics persist in surface water where they can harm aquatic life therefore developing efficient approaches to treat antibiotics is a major focus of research corn is one of the world s most important food crops and corncobs are a major agricultural waste 8 corncobs have no edible value and are often disposed of carelessly 9 thus corncobs are a waste of biological resources thus there is a need to develop efficient ways to utilize corncobs biochar is usually prepared from raw materials with high biomass content such as agricultural waste excess sludge and animal waste 10 therefore crushed corncobs and pyrolysis can be used to produce biochar at high temperatures biochar has lower production costs and can be prepared more simply with a wider variety of raw materials than activated carbon 11 current studies are focused on optimizing the biochar preparatory conditions to replace activated carbon adsorption and degradation are the two processes used by biochar to remove pollutants from an aqueous solution 12 adsorption is mediated by the adsorption sites on the surface of the biochar 13 most research on increasing the adsorption capacity of biochar has focused on increasing the number of functional groups and the specific surface area of the biochar 14 the adsorption capacity of biochar can be greatly enhanced by increasing temperature because the specific surface area of the biochar increases rapidly with temperature 15 however the specific surface area of pristine biochar does not increase significantly with temperature increases thus there is still room for improving the preparation of pristine biochar biochar also degrades organic pollutants by activating oxidants hydrogen peroxide persulfate and o2 to produce reactive oxygen species ros 15 among them peroxymonosulfate pms has become the most commonly used oxidant because of its high efficiency low cost and lack of secondary pollution 16 in addition the activated sulfate radical so4 lasts longer than the hydroxyl radical oh and can adapt to a wider ph range in an aqueous solution 17 the main degradation process of organic pollutants by pristine biochar is through the use of environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs and the defect structure of biochar to activate the oxidants 18 epfrs form a stable structure with a transition metal and transfer electrons to oxidants to produce instant free radicals 19 previous studies have suggested that epfrs play a dominant role in the degradation of organic pollutants when the preparation temperature is 300 500 c and the defect structure plays a dominant role when the preparation temperature is 600 c 20 the catalytic effect is even greater when the preparation temperature of the biochar is 900 c 7 because of the presence of pores in biochar in addition the continuous increase in temperature results in the formation of pores and catalytic active sites and the high temperature does not collapse the pores the ros produced include so4 oh and o2 21 the ability of pristine biochar to degrade organic pollutants can be improved biochar must be modified for its adsorption and degradation capacity to improve because biochar is used to remove water pollutants non toxic materials that do not lead to secondary pollution should be used for the process the heteroatom doping of nitrogen n and sulfur s in common organic reagents has received increasing interest from researchers 22 heteroatom doping involves mixing urea sodium thiosulfate thiourea and other common forms of organic matter with biomass to prepare heteroatom doped biochar containing n or s through pyrolysis or a hydrothermal process 23 this modification significantly improves the specific surface area of biochar and enhances the number of functional groups the preparation process of heteroatom doped biochar by hydrothermal carbonization pyrolysis provides more functional groups and active sites to degrade organic pollutants 24 in addition the degradation capacity of heteroatom doped biochar improves because n atoms replace c atoms and s atoms replace o atoms in the network structure thus altering the internal structure 25 however no consensus exists regarding the effect of s doping on the biochar degradation rate 23 in addition n and s doping alter the structure of the biochar and may increase the role of non free radical pathways in the degradation process 26 this change in the relative contribution of free radical and non free radical pathways to degradation may have a substantial effect on the degradation process therefore the efficiency and mechanism of antibiotic adsorption and degradation by n or s doped biochar require further study in this study heteroatom doped n doped nbc s doped sbc and ns doped nsbc biochars were prepared from corncobs to adsorb and degrade ofloxacin ofx chlorotetracycline ctc and sulfadiazine sdz at different temperatures the main objectives of this study were to 1 optimize the adsorption parameters and analyze the adsorption capacity of the heteroatom doped biochars 2 compare the degradation efficiency of antibiotics by nbc sbc and nsbc by activating pms at different preparation temperatures and 3 characterize the mechanism of adsorption specific surface area vs functional groups and the degradation process free radical pathway vs non free radical pathway by heteroatom doped biochar 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents ofx ctc sdz pms 42 khso5 urea 99 thiourea 99 na2s2o3 5h2o furfuryl alcohol ffa 98 ki 99 tert butyl

and preparation of the biochar corncobs were obtained in xinxiang city china the corncobs were dried in natural sunlight for 5 d after the corncobs were completely dried they were cut into pieces and crushed into 10 mesh 2 0 mm particles with a pulverizer next the corncobs were placed in a 2 l beaker and cleaned with deionized water to remove surface impurities and float ash the corncobs were dried in a blast drying oven at 80 c for 24 h and ground to 100 mesh 0 147 mm particles which were sealed and stored the heteroatom doping process was as follows first 50 g of pretreated corncobs were placed in a 1 l beaker different types and proportions of doping reagents were added including urea n doping at ratios of 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 mass ratio biomass urea na2s2o3 s doping at ratios of 3 1 2 1

storage pyrolysis involved a hydrothermal carbonization process followed by high temperature pyrolysis first the pretreated corncobs were placed in a 200 ml teflon lined high pressure reactor a stainless steel coat was added to the lining and the reactor was placed in the blast drying oven for the hydrothermal carbonization reaction next 16 g of corncobs were added the solid liquid ratio was controlled at 1 5 v v and the hydrothermal temperatures were controlled at 160 180 200 220 and 240 c for 2 h after the supernatant was removed the hydrochar was dried in an oven for 24 h finally the hydrochar samples 220 c were placed in a tube furnace for three n2 vacuum cycles and then pyrolyzed at 300 900 c for 2 h the biochar samples corresponding to different preparation temperatures were referred to as hp300 hp400 hp500 hp600 hp700 hp800 and hp900 undoped n doped s doped and ns doped biochar were referred to as bc nbc sbc and nsbc respectively 2 3 adsorption and degradation of antibiotics by the heteroatom doped biochar in this study a typical antibiotic sdz was used to study the adsorption process of the heteroatom doped biochar the adsorption of sdz by the heteroatom doped biochar was optimized by testing a variety of ph values dosages and contact times the concentration of sdz was 30 mg l the dosages tested were 1 2 3 4 and 5 g l 1 the ph values tested were 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 and the contact times tested were 1 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 min the ph of the solution was adjusted with 1 mol hcl and 1 mol naoh the prepared sdz solution was added to a 100 ml triangular flask containing biochar 4 ml of anhydrous ethanol was added and the mixture was placed in a thermostatic oscillator for 50 min after the reaction the mixture was filtered through a 0 22 μm microporous membrane and measurements were taken ethanol is commonly used as a radical scavenger as it inhibits the instant radicals that are generated in solution to calculate the adsorption rate more accurately the removal rate and equilibrium adsorption capacity were obtained from the adsorption data 1 q e v c 0 c e m 2 r c 0 c e c 0 where q e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g 1 v is the volume of antibiotics l c 0 is the initial concentration of sdz mg l c e is the equilibrium adsorption concentration mg l 1 and m is the amount of adsorbent g three antibiotics were used to study degradation of the heteroatom doped biochar the process of antibiotic degradation by the heteroatom doped biochar was as follows first 20 mg l ofx ctc and sdz were added with 3 g l 1 biochar and 5 mmol l 1 pms to a 100 ml triangle flask which was placed in a thermostatic oscillator and oscillated for 15 30 min without adjusting the ph the nbc reaction was run for 15 min and the reactions with bc sbc and nsbc were run for 30 min after the reaction the mixed liquor was filtered through a 0 22 μm microporous membrane all samples were measured at an interval of 2 or 5 min to calculate the apparent rate constant kobs of the degradation of the antibiotic by the biochar the free radical inhibitors during the degradation process were etoh tba bq and ffa which inhibited oh and so4 oh o2 and 1o2 respectively 2 4 determination of epfrs and ros in the heteroatom doped biochar epfrs on the surface of the heteroatom doped biochar including nbc sbc and nsbc were detected by the epr method at preparation temperatures of 300 900 c a total of 50 mg of biochar was added to a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 5 mm and measurements were taken from an epr instrument bruker emxplus bremen germany instant free radicals so4 oh and o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 in the liquid were detected by adding a corresponding trapping agent dmpo was used to capture so4 and oh and a dmso dmpo solution was used to capture o2 1o2 was captured in the temp solution the detailed capture methods and procedures were based on a previous study 15 all reagents were prepared using ph 7 pbs 2 5 total organic carbon toc and the antibiotic testing toc was determined using a toc analyzer elementer vario toc eschenbach germany o2 was used as the carrier gas and the system was composed of two channels the total amounts of carbon tc and inorganic carbon ic were determined ten ml water samples were injected through the injection port with a microsyringe so that they were completely burned or decomposed the co2 concentration was determined after the combusted gas moved the water vapor into the infrared portion of the analyzer toc tc ic a high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters e2695 milford ma usa system was used with a wondasil c18 column to separate the organic compounds the detection wavelength for ctc was 365 nm and methanol water v v 67 33 was added the detection wavelength for sdz was 264 nm and methanol water v v 85 15 was added and the detection wavelength for lev was 288 nm and methanol water v v 80 10 was added all contaminants were tested in 10 μl with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and a column temperature of 30 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the heteroatom doped biochar scanning electron microscopy sem revealed many holes on the surface of the biochar and the fibrous structure of the plant was evident fig 1 after heteroatom doping the surface structure of the biochar was smoother the surface layer was covered with the doping reagent but the pore structure on the surface could still be seen indicating that the surface structure of the doped biochar was clear biochar doped with na2s2o3 had a rod like crystal structure on its surface indicating that the inorganic salts had been successfully loaded onto the surface of the biochar 27 sem showed that the heteroatom doping effect was pronounced and the surface changes in the biochar could be seen table s1 shows that the specific surface area of the biochar prepared by high temperature pyrolysis of the biomass increased significantly by 30 1 336 2 times the specific surface areas of bc nbc sbc and nsbc were 84 93 345 03 205 34 466 74 195 88 404 61 and 45 85 198 94 m2 g 1 at the preparation temperatures of 500 700 and 900 c respectively this result indicates that the doping of n or s had a positive effect on the structure of the biochar by increasing the specific surface area and providing more favorable conditions for subsequent adsorption and degradation however the specific surface area of the ns doped biochar was lower than that of the undoped biochar suggesting that ns doping may not enhance adsorption or antibiotic degradation by the biochar when the preparation temperature was 500 700 and 900 c the total pores of bc nbc sbc and nsbc were 0 0562 0 1464 0 0853 0 1969 0 0813 0 1678 and 0 0304 0 0828 cm3 g 1 respectively the change in the total pores was consistent with the change in specific surface area nbc had the most pores and nsbc had the fewest number of pores the average pore size range of the three types of biochar was 1 39 2 67 nm the average pore size of the biochar was inversely related to the specific surface area table s2 reveals that the n content of nbc was 1 93 which was similar to bc 1 19 this result indicates that a small amount of additional n significantly improved the adsorption and degradation capacity of the biochar after s doping s content increased significantly to 5 796 in sbc which was significantly higher than that of bc s 0 183 and nsbc s 0 972 this finding indicates that a greater amount of s was successfully doped into the biochar which could be used to effectively adsorb and degrade the antibiotics the id ig value showed that the defect structure of nbc and sbc was slightly enhanced and the id ig value of nsbc was consistent with that of bc indicating that the catalytic degradation performance of nbc and sbc could be superior to that of nsbc fig 2a in general the id ig value indicates the strength of the defect structure of the biochar the ratio of large defects is strong and the ratio of small defects is weak 19 therefore id ig reflects the catalytic ability of biochar to degrade organic pollutants the thermogravimetric analysis indicated a large difference between the corncobs and the corncob biochar fig 2b the weight of the corncobs decreased rapidly after heating from 0 to 400 c the mass loss was 75 72 when the preparation temperature reached 500 c nbc also had a greater mass loss this was likely explained by the fact that na2s2o3 salt reagent was used for s doping which remains on the surface and pores of the biochar after doping the residual reagent volatilizes and disappears when heated to 650 c resulting in the high mass loss 31 75 the weight losses of bc nbc and sbc remained more or less constant 15 this can be explained by the fact that the n doping and s doping reagents are organic reagents which do not remain on the surface of the biochar during the doping process consequently the mass loss after pyrolysis was the same as that of bc based on the organic element analysis the amount of s doped in sbc was much higher than that of the other heteroatom doped biochar samples and the specific surface area increased indicating that inorganic salt and organic reagents can be used for heteroatom doping fig 1c shows that the characteristic peaks of the heteroatom doped biochar were the ch bond at 649 cm 1 the c o c bond at 1124 cm 1 and the co bond at 1607 cm 1 in addition the cs bond 653 cm 1 appeared in the 720 622 cm 1 region for sbc and nsbc 28 the characteristic peaks at 2929 cm 1 and 3446 cm 1 corresponded to ch2 and oh respectively the oh stretching vibrations decreased slightly after pyrolysis of the biochar a new band appeared at 2343 cm 1 after heteroatom doping corresponding to cn for nbc and nsbc the emergence of new peaks also indicated that n was successfully doped into the biochar various characterization methods revealed that the physical and chemical properties of the biochar doped with heteroatoms improved in particular the increase in the surface area and the number of new functional groups after doping improved antibiotic adsorption and degradation by the biochar 3 2 optimization of the adsorption parameters and model analysis the ph of the solution the dosage of the adsorbent and the contact time are important parameters affecting the efficacy of the adsorption of pollutants by biochar we optimized the adsorption process by identifying the optimal parameters fig 3a shows that the optimal ph for adsorbing sdz by all biochars was 7 and the ph gradually decreased from 3 to 5 when the ph was 6 it began to rise gradually and reached a maximum of 7 it then decreased rapidly from 7 to 9 fig 2b shows that the isoelectric points of bc nbc sbc and nsbc were 2 21 2 03 1 92 and 2 14 respectively the isoelectric points of several of the biochars were similar indicating that the isoelectric point changes little after heteroatomic doping sdz assumes different forms ionizing or neutral at different ph values which is related to the ionization constant pka the dissociation constant pka of sdz is 6 48 and the adsorption effect of sdz was highest when the sdz dissociation constant was close to this value 29 the optimal dosage for sdz adsorption by all biochars was 3 g l 1 fig 3c the optimal adsorption rates of bc nbc sbc and nsbc for the antibiotics were 59 76 70 26 65 15 and 50 66 respectively the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e corresponding to the optimal removal rates of sdz by bc nbc sbc and nsbc were 7 32 8 02 7 68 and 6 71 mg g 1 respectively the q e of the adsorbent for sdz decreased rapidly when the dosage was increased from 1 to 5 g l 1 q e decreased after the dosage was increased because an increase in dosage does not mean that the adsorbent can efficiently adsorb all pollutants thus many adsorbents have a blocking and shielding effect between adsorption sites which affects the adsorption rate 30 fig 3d shows that the biochar and heteroatom doped biochar reach the adsorption equilibrium within 30 min the q e of nbc was the highest 8 07 mg g 1 followed by sbc 7 66 mg g 1 bc 7 28 mg g 1 and nsbc 6 67 mg g 1 the adsorption curves of the several types of heteroatom doped biochar on sdz over time were consistent however the adsorption rate differed but the change in the removal rate was consistent with the findings described above the optimal adsorption parameters for sdz were ph of 7 dosage of 3 g l 1 and contact time of 30 min the microstructural characterization and adsorption data of the heteroatom doped biochar showed that the adsorption of sdz mainly depended on the interaction between the surface functional groups and specific surface area 3 3 antibiotic adsorption model for the heteroatom doped biochar 3 3 1 adsorption isothermal model adsorption plays an important role during the removal of an antibiotic by heteroatom doped biochar the data were further analyzed using the langmuir and freundlich isothermal adsorption models 31 the langmuir model is used to describe the adsorption of a monomolecular layer and to calculate the maximum saturated adsorption capacity of the adsorbent which is useful to evaluate the potential of the adsorbent 3 q e b q m c e 1 b c e eq 3 is the langmuir isothermal model and its linear form is 4 1 q e 1 q m 1 c e b q m where b is the sdz equilibrium adsorption coefficient l mg 1 q m is the maximum saturated adsorption capacity mg g 1 q e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g 1 and c e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg l 1 the freundlich model is used to determine whether antibiotic adsorption by the adsorbent is multi molecular layer adsorption and the detailed equation is as follows 5 q e k f c e 1 n 6 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where k f is the adsorption coefficient related to adsorption capacity mg g 1 l mg 1 l n table 1 shows the sdz adsorption data for all of the biochars the langmuir model average r2 0 9970 was a better fit for the adsorption of sdz by the heteroatom doped biochar than the freundlich model average r2 0 9741 based on the experimental data calculated with the langmuir model the q m values were 40 7 bc 85 5 nbc 63 3 sbc and 22 1 mg g 1 nsbc on the one hand the langmuir model shows that the adsorption of sdz by the heteroatom doped biochar was a monomolecular adsorption process on the other hand the langmuir model was also useful to evaluate the adsorption potential of the adsorbent using the maximum saturated adsorption capacity table s3 shows that sdz adsorption capacity was better than that of the other adsorbents using the heteroatom doped corncob biochar n or s doped biochar was superior to pristine biochar but the q m was slightly lower for the pristine biochar than organically modified biochar in addition the heteroatom doped biochar is more economical and environmentally friendly the q m of pristine biochar was low and the q m of modified biochar was large indicating that biochar still has much room for improvement 3 3 2 adsorption kinetic model the adsorption kinetics were examined and the reaction process was characterized in addition the rate limiting steps were determined and the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were established 32 the pseudo first order kinetic model was 7 log q e 1 q t log q e 1 k 1 t 2 303 where q t is the equilibrium adsorption capacity at time t mg g 1 q e1 is the theoretical adsorption capacity mg g 1 and k 1 is a constant the pseudo second order kinetic model was formulated as follows 8 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 2 t q e 2 where k 2 is the constant of the pseudo second order kinetic model table 2 shows the adsorption kinetics model of the heteroatom doped biochar for the adsorption of antibiotics the q e1 cal of the pseudo first order kinetic model differed from the experimentally measured q e exp value and the r2 was 0 8577 0 9914 the correlation coefficient and equilibrium adsorption capacity indicated that the pseudo first order kinetics model was not suitable to fit the adsorption data this model was only useful for describing the initial stage of antibiotic adsorption and could not be used to describe the entire adsorption process the average r2 of the pseudo second order kinetic model was 0 9996 and the qe1 was close to the qe exp which could be used to describe the entire adsorption process therefore the pseudo second order kinetic model was more suitable than the pseudo first order kinetic model for the adsorption of antibiotics by the heteroatom doped biochar overall the pseudo first order kinetic model was useful for describing the initial stage of adsorption and the pseudo second order kinetic model was useful for describing the entire adsorption process almost all of the adsorption processes were consistent with the latter 3 3 3 adsorption thermodynamic parameters the gibbs function δg 0 value indicates whether a reaction occurs spontaneously under certain conditions reactions generally occur spontaneously when δg 0 0 in addition enthalpy is an endothermic reaction when δh 0 0 but an exothermic reaction when δh 0 0 9 δ g 0 rt ln k d 10 ln k d δ s 0 r δ h 0 rt 11 k d q e c e 12 δ g 0 δ h 0 t δ s 0 where r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k and k d is a constant table 3 shows that the adsorption of antibiotics by the heteroatom doped biochar was exothermic and the δh 0 values were 8 15 10 17 17 01 and 14 69 kj mol 1 for bc nbc sbc and nsbc respectively the entropy value δs 0 is a physical quantity of the disorder of matter δg 0 was 0 during the entire adsorption process indicating that the adsorption of antibiotics by the heteroatom doped biochar proceeded spontaneously 3 4 change of the epfrs in the heteroatom doped biochar epfrs were generated during preparation of the heteroatom doped biochar and played an important role in activating pms to produce ros particularly at the preparation temperatures of 300 500 c fig 4 shows the epfr signal generated in the heteroatom doped biochar at preparation temperatures of 300 500 c epfr signal intensity gradually increased as the preparation temperature was increased table 4 shows that the concentrations of the epfrs were the highest when the preparation temperature of the heteroatom doped biochar was 500 c and their concentrations in bc 500 nbc 500 sbc 500 and nsbc 500 were 7 96 1018 3 19 1019 2 11 1019 and 4 58 1018 spin g 1 respectively at a lower preparation temperature 300 c the concentrations of epfrs in bc 300 nbc 300 sbc 300 and nsbc 300 were 3 28 1018 8 35 1018 6 77 1019 and 2 16 1018 spin g 1 respectively the concentrations of the epfrs produced by the biochar through n and s doping also increased indicating that the catalytic degradation of antibiotics by biochar could be improved by single element doping a positive correlation has been reported between the concentrations of epfrs and the degradation efficiency of antibiotics 28 therefore heteroatom doping enhances the degradation of antibiotics by biochar except for ns doped biochar in addition epfrs were not be detected at 600 or 700 c indicating that epfrs decompose gradually when the temperature is higher the decomposition temperature of the biochar prepared from different types of biomass varied slightly but the decomposition temperature was usually 600 c the type of epfr is also important for the catalytic degradation of antibiotics the g factors determine the epfr species which are usually divided into three types carbon centered free radicals g1 2 0030 carbon centered radicals with oxygen atoms 2 0030 g2 2 0040 and oxygen centered free radicals g3 2 0040 table 4 shows the changes in the g factor for the epfrs produced by the heteroatom doped biochar the g factor decreased as preparation temperature was increased when the preparation temperature was 300 c g1 type epfrs were dominant in the heteroatom doped biochar and the g2 type epfrs were dominant in bc this was explained by the increase in oxygen containing functional groups in the biochar after heteroatom doping consistent with the results of the organic element analysis section 3 1 an increase in the oxygen content changed the type of epfr the g3 type epfr was dominant at 300 c whereas the g2 type epfrs were dominant in bc and nsbc when the temperature reached 400 c nbc and sbc had low g factors of 2 0032 0 0002 and 2 0031 0 0001 respectively although g2 type epfrs were present in nbc and sbc at this temperature their g factors were close to 2 0030 suggesting the presence of g1 type epfrs when the preparation temperature was increased to 500 c the g factors of the four types of biochar continued to decrease and carbon centered free radicals became dominant g1 2 0030 oxygen centered free radicals carbon centered radicals with oxygen atoms and carbon centered free radicals were the dominant epfrs at preparation temperatures of 300 400 and 500 c respectively however only the g2 and g1 type epfrs were observed in bc when the preparation temperature was 300 500 c this finding indicates that the species of epfr became richer after heteroatom doping and included all three types of epfrs carbon centered radicals were dominant in nbc and sbc g factor close to 2 0030 when the preparation temperature was 400 c most studies have suggested that carbon centered free radicals are potentially more active thus they may improve the ability of biochar to degrade antibiotics 33 the increase in carbon centered free radicals may also improve the ability of biochar to degrade antibiotics 34 the epfrs and the degradation ability of biochar were maximized when the preparation temperature of the heteroatom doped biochar reached 500 c no signals were detected in the epfrs of biochar at 600or 700 c and the epfrs decomposed rapidly when the preparation temperature was 500 c 3 5 degradation of antibiotics by the heteroatom doped biochar 3 5 1 degradation of antibiotics by the heteroatom doped biochar at different preparation temperatures no less than 50 of the sdz c 0 30 mg l 1 was adsorbed by the heteroatom doped biochar based on the results of the adsorption experiment the initial concentration of 20 mg l was used to degrade the antibiotics sdz ctc and ofx fig 5 shows the degradation rates of the three antibiotics by all of the biochars at preparation temperatures from 300to 900 c the adsorption data are provided in fig s1 changes in the degradation rate of the antibiotics were divided into three parts the first process occurred from 300 to 500 c and the removal rate increased gradually over this temperature range the removal rate of antibiotics was highest for nbc followed by sbc nsbc and bc the average removal rates of antibiotics by nbc sbc nsbc and bc at 500 c were 84 32 79 60 74 10 and 73 83 respectively the improvement in the degradation rate of antibiotics was attributed to the action of epfrs the mineralization rate of antibiotics ranged from 36 9 to 43 44 and the mineralization rate increased as the degradation rate increased fig s2a thus less than half of the antibiotics were completely degraded into co2 h2o and other inorganic substances e g f or cl during the degradation process the continuous increase in the degradation rate of antibiotics originated from the rapid increase in the concentration of epfrs in the biochar as the preparation temperature was increased the epfrs activated pms and quickly produced ros to degrade the antibiotics higher concentrations of epfrs resulted in a greater amount of ros and thus a higher degradation rate the second process occurred from 500 to 600 c and the removal rate sharply decreased over this temperature range the removal rates of the antibiotics by nbc sbc nsbc and bc at 600 c were 70 71 67 80 62 84 and 65 13 respectively the removal rate of antibiotics decreased by 11 34 on average at 600 c compared with that at 500 c this can be explained by the rapid decomposition of epfrs leading to a reduction in the activation efficiency of pms which cannot produce sufficient ros to degrade the antibiotics therefore the removal rate of antibiotics may be positively correlated with the concentration of epfrs the third process occurred from 600 to 900 c and the removal rate increased gradually to its maximum value the removal rates of nbc sbc nsbc and bc at 900 c were 93 78 91 11 81 55 and 82 38 respectively the toc of the antibiotics at 900 c was 48 95 and nearly half of the antibiotics were completely degraded fig s2b the toc value of the antibiotics via heteroatom doped biochar degradation was high compared to other advanced oxidation technologies at this stage the epfrs were completely decomposed but the biochar can still activate pms to produce ros and degrade antibiotics this is because the defect structure of the biochar became more pronounced as the preparation temperature was increased and the defect structure activated pms to produce ros to degrade the antibiotics when the temperature reached 900 c the disappearance of the epfrs did not reduce the removal rate of the antibiotics and the removal rate continued to increase however the high temperature of 900 c did not result in the collapse of internal pores in the biochar but increased the specific surface area this is because the internal pores of the biochar were well developed and high temperatures further increased the number of internal pores the removal rates of antibiotics in the three types of heteroatom doped biochar from large to small were nbc sbc and nsbc the results of the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis are shown in fig 6 the xps analysis showed that the proportion of graphite n was high in nbc 68 8 and nsbc 70 3 graphite n directly affects the degradation efficiency of antibiotics 35 the contents of pyridine n in nbc and nsbc were 18 7 and 23 5 respectively the contents of pyrrole n in nbc and nsbc were 12 5 and 6 2 respectively the effects of pyridine n and pyrrole n on the degradation of antibiotics by the heteroatom doped biochar were weaker than those of graphite n the percentage of c s c in sbc 19 0 and nsbc 38 1 differed the c s c bond is the sbc active group and the higher content in biochar results in higher catalytic activity for antibiotic degradation 23 however the antibiotic degradation rate was lower by nsbc than by sbc this may be explained by the fact that both n and s occur in nsbc and their combined action may have affected the biochar active sites in addition nsbc had the lowest specific surface area which might also explain its low efficiency in antibiotic degradation the content of the c sox c group in sbc was high and s and o form this group this is consistent with the results of the organic element analysis section 3 1 o content increased significantly in sbc because of the c sox c group in general the heteroatom doped biochar had the highest antibiotic degradation rate at 500 c average r 77 and 900 c average r 87 epfrs played a major role in the degradation process when the preparation temperature was 500 c whereas the defect structure played a major role in the degradation process at 900 c nbc and sbc had the highest antibiotic degradation efficiency and nsbc had the lowest indicating that doping of a single element n or s is more conducive to improving the catalytic performance of biochar whereas ns doping had the opposite effect 3 5 2 apparent rate constant of antibiotic degradation by the heteroatom doped biochar the rate at which the heteroatom doped biochar degrades antibiotics is important and the degradation data were further analyzed by the apparent rate constant kobs fig 7 shows the antibiotic degradation efficiency by the heteroatom doped biochar within 30 min sbc nsbc and bc reached a balance in degradation at 30 min and the removal rate of antibiotics by nbc reached an average of 93 78 in 12 min the average degradation rates of the antibiotics by bc nbc and sbc were 91 11 81 55 and 82 38 in 30 min respectively the degradation efficiency of nbc was higher than that of the other types of heteroatom doped biochar and 90 of the antibiotics were completely degraded within a short period demonstrating that nbc is effective for degrading antibiotics table 5 shows the kobs values of antibiotic degradation by the heteroatom doped biochar according to the kobs values the antibiotic degradation efficiency was much higher by nbc followed by sbc the antibiotic degradation efficiency of nsbc and bc did not differ the kobs analysis showed that the efficiency of antibiotic degradation improved by nbc and sbc but the degradation process was not greatly affected by nsbc nbc degraded more than 90 of the antibiotics in 12 min which was much more efficient than bc 3 6 free radical and non free radical reactions of the heteroatom doped biochar 3 6 1 contribution of different ros to degradation the ros produced by the heteroatom doped biochar after activating pms included so4 oh o2 and 1o2 ros vary in their ability to degrade antibiotics determining the contribution of ros is important when analyzing the degradation mechanism in control experiments etoh tba tempol and ffa were used to inhibit so4 oh oh o2 and 1o2 respectively 36 fig 8 shows that the antibiotic removal rate by the heteroatom doped biochar decreased sharply when so4 and oh were inhibited the antibiotic degradation rates by nbc sbc nsbc and bc were 45 40 37 44 30 93 and 31 49 respectively the degradation rate was nearly 50 lower after ethanol was added compared to before ethanol was added indicating that so4 and oh play a dominant role in antibiotic degradation the degradation rate did not decrease significantly after adding tba to inhibit oh and the average antibiotic degradation rates by nbc sbc nsbc and bc decreased by 12 55 11 86 11 34 and 12 14 respectively this result suggests that so4 is a major contributor to antibiotic degradation compared to oh 37 the antibiotic degradation rate decreased by less than 5 when o2 was inhibited indicating that o2 had little effect on antibiotic degradation finally inhibiting 1o2 by adding ffa significantly decreased the antibiotic degradation rate by the heteroatom doped biochar however the antibiotic degradation rates by bc after adding ffa only decreased by 7 00 5 31 and 5 55 compared to before ffa was added respectively indicating that 1o2 had little effect on antibiotic degradation by bc heteroatom doping may alter the mechanism of antibiotic degradation by biochar and the increase in the non free radical pathway 1o2 may be one of the main reasons for the increase in the antibiotic degradation rate 38 the effect of different ros on antibiotic degradation was verified by the control experiments in which different inhibitors were added the ros with the strongest ability to inhibit the degradation rate was so4 followed by 1o2 oh and o2 1o2 contributed little to the degradation rate by bc 3 6 2 intermediate antibiotic products during degradation the degradation intermediates of all antibiotics were measured by liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy bruker ultimate 3000 and the corresponding spectrum is shown in fig s3 table 6 shows that ofx ctc and sdz consisted of five five and three types of intermediate products respectively the m z values of the ctc intermediates were 274 9 217 1 165 0 122 9 and 150 0 the m z values of the ofx intermediates were 354 8 348 8 341 2 300 8 and 322 8 and the m z values of the sdz intermediates were 217 1 186 6 and 96 1 antibiotics were degraded by the heteroatom doped biochar and gradually decomposed into small molecules such as co2 and h2o 39 other inorganic substances such as f or cl were also observed 3 7 mechanism of antibiotic degradation by the heteroatom doped biochar and the antibiotic intermediates the heteroatom doped biochar directly adsorbed the antibiotics on the surface this process mainly takes advantage of the large specific surface area and functional groups the epfrs quickly activated the pms to produce instant radicals when pms was added as shown in eqs 13 16 including so4 oh and o2 the so4 oh o2 and 1o2 signals are shown in fig 9 the earliest activation of pms by the heteroatom doped biochar produces so4 which rapidly degraded the antibiotics so4 was metabolized into oh in the presence of h2o and oh subsequently oh began to degrade the antibiotics according to the analysis in section 3 6 1 the contribution rate of oh to antibiotic degradation was lower than that of so4 when dissolved oxygen is present in the water the epfrs provide electrons to o2 molecules to produce o2 however the contribution of o2 was small throughout the control experiment and the antibiotics were not degraded by o2 epfrs play a major role in the preparation of heteroatom doped biochar at 300 500 c 15 13 nbc or sbc pms epfr s s o 4 14 s o 4 h 2 o hs o 4 oh 15 s o 4 o h s o 4 2 oh 16 nbc sbc o 2 epfr s o 2 in addition to these free radical pathways non free radical pathways occurred in the antibiotic degradation system of the heteroatom doped biochar the control experiment showed that 1o2 contributed significantly to antibiotic degradation the non free radical pathway was more significant in the degradation process in the heteroatom doped biochar than bc in the non free radical pathway pms was further decomposed to 1o2 or directly receives electrons from the antibiotics to degrade them 40 17 hs o 5 s o 5 2 s o 4 2 hs o 4 o 1 2 according to the analysis of the variation in the degradation rate at different temperatures section 3 5 1 the ability of the heteroatom doped biochar to degrade antibiotics improved significantly when the preparation temperature was 700 c and reached a maximum value at 900 c the improvement in the antibiotic degradation rate was attributed to the enhancement of the defect structure of the heteroatom doped biochar raman spectroscopy is the most intuitive approach for characterizing the structure of biochar the raman spectra of biochar prepared at temperatures of 500 700 and 900 c and the data are provided in fig s4 a comparison of the raman spectra of the heteroatom doped biochar at different preparation temperatures revealed that the id ig value increased indicating that the defect structure gradually became more pronounced as the temperature was increased the defect structure of biochar also activated pms to produce ros and degrade the antibiotics therefore the defect structure of biochar is the main factor mediating antibiotic degradation at higher preparation temperatures at preparation temperatures of 300 500 c epfrs play a major role in activating pms whereas the defect structure is dominant in the free radical pathway after 700 c the non free radical pathway of antibiotic degradation by biochar was enhanced after heteroatom doping 1o2 is a major contributor to antibiotic degradation in the non free radical pathway 3 8 reusability of the heteroatom doped biochar the reusability of biochar is another important criterion for evaluating the degradation of organic pollutants nbc and sbc which had the greatest degradation effects were used in five cycles of antibiotic degradation fig 10 shows that the removal rates of the antibiotics degraded by bc nbc and sbc decreased by 19 26 11 58 and 9 24 respectively after five cycles this result indicates that heteroatom doped biochar has high reusability and its overall effect was superior to that of undoped biochar despite the decrease in the removal rate after five cycles the overall removal rate of the heteroatom doped biochar remained high 81 94 and 78 06 for nbc and sbc respectively compared to the undoped biochar 63 30 thus the persistence of biochar utilization increased to a certain extent after heteroatom doping the reduction in the removal rate mainly stemmed from the consumption of active surface sites and the oxidation of the defect structure which reduced the catalytic degradation ability of antibiotics by biochar 16 in general heteroatom doped biochar has high reusability which reduces costs and improves the utilization of biochar 4 conclusion in this study typical antibiotics were removed by heteroatom doped biochar prepared from corncobs the adsorption and degradation of antibiotics improved in response to the heteroatom doped biochar the adsorption capacity of nbc or sbc increased because of the increase in specific surface area and the number of functional groups the maximum saturated adsorption capacities of nbc and sbc were 85 5 and 63 3 mg g 1 which were higher than those of bc 22 10 mg g 1 and nsbc 22 10 mg g 1 all biochar adsorbed antibiotics were consistent with the langmuir model and quasi second order kinetic model and the reaction was exothermic the main role of heteroatom doped biochar is to generate ros to degrade antibiotics by activating pms during degradation the concentration of epfrs increased after heteroatom doping and the type of epfr changed single atom doping greatly improved the efficiency of antibiotic degradation so4 played a major role in the free radical pathway of antibiotic degradation by the heteroatom doped biochar followed by oh and o2 the heteroatom doping of biochar enhanced the non free radical pathway and 1o2 was the major contributor to antibiotic degradation in the non free radical pathway antibiotics were degraded by the heteroatom doped biochar and eventually formed co2 and h2o as well as other inorganic substances f or cl the reuse experiment confirmed that the heteroatom doped biochar degraded antibiotics efficiently after five cycles overall heteroatom doping improved the range of biochar applications declaration of
