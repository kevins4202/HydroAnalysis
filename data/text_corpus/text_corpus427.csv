2135,drought is a detrimental global warming effect that severely impacts the environment society and economy drought indices are used worldwide for drought monitoring and assessments this study aims to develop a new meteorological drought index based on fuzzy logic fl and neuro fuzzy models to describe and predict droughts the developed models were compared to nine conventional drought indices and correlated with multiple drought indicators different combinations of inputs such as maximum temperature mean temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were tested to develop the models observed weather data from alice springs australia were used to examine the developed models and train the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis model additionally historical records of various drought indicators were used to evaluate the predictions of all models including deep soil moisture lower soil moisture root zone soil moisture upper soil moisture and runoff this study showed that the rainfall anomaly drought index rai was the best conventional drought index with the highest correlation 0 718 between the drought index and upper soil moisture drought indicator the average of the best performing fl models outperformed all conventional indices with a correlation of 0 784 with the upper soil moisture moreover when the average output of the best performing fl models was used for training the best anfis model had a correlation of 0 809 with upper soil moisture the best anfis model in terms of correlation with conventional drought indices had a correlation of 0 941 with the rai when the normalised average output of the best performing conventional drought indices was used for training to validate the developed models drought assessment was conducted for five stations in different climate zones and seasons the validation results showed that the developed models had similar performance to the best correlated conventional drought index rai in most cases the developed models yielded better predictions compared to the conventional index in the subtropical and tropical regions overall the developed soft computing drought indices based on fuzzy logic and anfis outperformed conventional methods thus effectively contributing to more precise drought prediction and mitigation data availability online data source 1 introduction the global surface temperature has been rising drastically during the last century mainly due to anthropogenic reasons and is projected to increase until greenhouse gas ghg emissions are significantly decreased ipcc 2022 on average the temperature had risen by 0 08 c per decade since 1880 and 2020 was the warmest year on record with around 0 98 c warmer than the twentieth century average over the world lindsey and dahlman 2021 this rise in temperature caused variations in precipitation humidity and wind speed these variations especially in precipitation affect stream flow leading to extreme events including floods and droughts trenberth 2011 drought is one of the main consequences of climate change and can vary in duration intensity and frequency jenkins and warren 2015 drought is usually defined as extended periods with below average rainfall causing a shortage of surface water groundwater or both drought can lead to crop destruction soil erosion and severe water supply shortages kalamaras et al 2010 wilhite and glantz 1985 classified drought into four major categories namely meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic the first three categories are used to measure drought as a physical phenomenon on the other hand the fourth drought category i e socioeconomic is used to track the impacts of water deficiency on humanity through socioeconomic systems meteorological drought is stated merely based on the degree of aridity i e receiving less than average rainfall łabędzki and bąk 2014 agricultural drought is associated with meteorological drought with agrarian effects mainly based on precipitation scarcity variation between actual and potential evapotranspiration and soil water shortages the most common definition of agricultural drought is the soil water deficit of a particular crop during a specific period hydrological drought is defined as the low recharge of water from the soil to water resources such as streams lakes and groundwater dutta et al 2015 drought is mainly characterised by six elements namely duration magnitude intensity severity geographic extent and frequency zargar et al 2011 definitions of these drought characteristics are given below the drought duration depends on the region and can fluctuate from days to years on different time scales drought magnitude is the accumulated shortage of water below the threshold during a drought period whereas drought intensity is the ratio of the drought magnitude to its duration drought severity is the degree of impact of a deficit the geographic extent of drought is the spatial distribution of drought the drought frequency is the return period defined as the mean time between drought events with a severity equal to or greater than the threshold zargar et al 2011 drought indices are key tools for drought assessment and management mukherjee et al 2018 which are used to empirically compute and compare drought characteristics such as severity duration and geographic extent across districts with various climatic and hydrological regimes stagge et al 2015 several conventional drought indices have been developed and widely used for drought monitoring to reduce drought impacts multiple studies have investigated the capacity of various drought indices to monitor and assess drought for example loukas et al 2008 used the standardised precipitation index spi to assess drought severity in thessaly greece the index was calculated for multiple timescales 1 3 6 9 and 12 months using data from 50 precipitation stations over 30 years the study showed that the thessaly region experienced frequent moderate and severe droughts in the past and indicated that the future and the far future would face a considerable increase in drought events tefera et al 2019 compared the most common meteorological drought indices that is spi and standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei in the tigray region northern ethiopia the results of this study indicate that spi and spei showed a fair level of agreement haied et al 2017 evaluated drought in algeria using deciles spi and reconnaissance drought index rdi and reported a good correlation between spi and rdi at different time scales proving that these two indices are well adapted to the study area however the rdi which requires precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration data as an input resulted in a more accurate outcome in comparison to the deciles and spi which require precipitation data only as an input for duration and severity assessment despite the widespread use of conventional drought indices they are considered old techniques and their performance varies significantly depending on their input parameters in addition these techniques sometimes lead to uncertain results when adapted to different conditions weng et al 2015 as a good alternative to conventional methods soft computing techniques require less development time minimal input easy implementation and generally low computational costs many studies have adopted soft computing methods for drought monitoring and forecasting for instance abbasi et al 2019 utilized spei and gene expression programming gep model for drought forecasting over various timescales the model accuracy increased from 60 1 in spei1 one month scale to 92 3 in spei48 48 month scale demonstrating that the overall accuracy was enhanced by increasing the scale of spei another study was carried out by kisi et al 2019 who compared the performance of four evolutionary adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis methods after obtaining the monthly precipitation data it was found that when predicting the spi index in various time series the neuro fuzzy methods outperformed the classical anfis method by comparing the rmse of the models keskin et al 2009 applied the spi and an advanced drought analysis model using fuzzy logic fl and anfis for meteorological drought analysis at nine stations in turkey at different time scales the study reported that the anfis model had a high capacity for drought assessment malik et al 2020 established a modern version of the fl model called the co active neuro fuzzy inference system canfis which predicts spi at different time scales at six stations in uttarakhand state india the study compared the spi simulation of canfis with two other models including classical artificial intelligence and regression models and reported that the canfis model predicted spi better than the other two models shirmohammadi et al 2013 forecasted meteorological drought using wavelet ann and anfis hybrid models for various time scales in the south eastern part of azerbaijan province iran this study demonstrated that the anfis model provided more accurate predictions than the artificial neural network ann model few studies e g zhang et al 2019 adnan et al 2015 and bahrami et al 2019 have applied soft computing techniques to predict and assess drought however those studies were limited to simulating the conventional drought indices i e since their training data included the outcomes of the conventional drought index as the true outputs the newly developed ai model could only perform as good as the conventional index used to create it moreover the ai model performance was rarely correlated to various environmental and hydrological drought indicators this study aims to develop a new meteorological drought index based on fl rules describing the relationship between the drought and major meteorological features the specific objectives of this research were to 1 assess the efficiency of conventional meteorological drought indices using correlations with various indicators 2 develop a new fl based drought index and evaluate its capability to predict drought and 3 assess the capacity of the anfis technique to improve predictions from the developed fl based drought index as an original contribution to the literature this comprehensive study aims to incorporate data from conventional indices with soil moisture data to create a better input dataset for the fl and anfis based drought indices the developed methodology is expected to improve the accuracy of drought assessment supporting decision makers in planning and mitigation 2 study area and data australia is the driest inhabited continent in the world as approximately 70 of the country is classified as either arid rainfall less than 250 mm or semi arid rainfall between 250 and 350 mm pilz 2010 fig 1 shows different climate classification zones in australia in the present study the seven selected meteorological stations are located in alice springs in the northern territory in the middle of the australian desert with geographical coordinates of 23 70 s latitude and 133 88 e longitude table 1 lists the details and coordinates of the seven meteorological stations the data were provided by the bureau of meteorology australia national weather and climate agency monthly precipitation maximum and mean temperatures and latitude data from 1985 to 2020 were available for each station in addition to the above mentioned data including precipitation maximum and mean temperature and latitude deep soil moisture lower soil moisture root zone soil moisture upper soil moisture and runoff data were used as drought indicators monthly drought indicator data were available from 2005 to 2020 for all studied stations however as the required data was collected from climatic stations and dated many years ago it is expected that the data are prone to uncertainty due to inaccuracies in measurements human errors and data gaps 3 methodology this study aimed to establish a novel soft computing model for drought monitoring and assessment fig 2 summarises the methodological framework of the study the first step was to collect the input data that is precipitation i1 and maximum mean temperature i2 the other set of collected data was the drought indicators namely deep soil moisture di1 lower soil moisture di2 root zone soil moisture di3 upper soil moisture di4 and runoff di5 for the seven selected meteorological stations in the study area following data collection linear interpolation was used to fill any gaps in the data it should be noted that the available temperature data were collected from four stations alice springs airport kulgera jervois and curtin springs located around the study area whereas the precipitation data were collected from the seven stations listed in table 2 therefore the temperature data were transformed from four stations to seven stations listed in table 2 using the inverse distance weighting method idw several methods are available to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet such as hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1985 thornthwaite thornthwaite 1948 and blaney criddle doorenbos pruitt 1977 in the present study pet was calculated using the thornthwaite method as it is widely used in the field and requires minimal data average temperature and latitude al sudani 2019 according to this method pet can be calculated using equations 1 to 3 thornthwaite 1948 and equations 4 to 6 thornthwaite mather 1957 as follows 1 pet 16 k 10 t i i m 2 i i 1 12 t i 5 1 514 3 m 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 792 10 2 i 0 49239 4 k n 12 ndm 30 n 24 π ω s 5 6 ω s a r c c o s t a n θ t a n δ where t is the average temperature in month i c i is the annual heat index calculated as the sum of 12 monthly index values k is a correction factor n is the maximum number of sun hours ndm is the number of days in a specific month ω s is the hourly angle of the sun θ is the latitude radians and δ is the declination angle of the sun radians the following steps in the methodology were used to estimate drought using conventional methods such as standardised precipitation index spi percent of normal index pni china z index czi modified china z index mczi rainfall anomaly index rai z score index zsi palmer drought severity index pdsi standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and reconnaissance drought index rdi using the dmap software r program and drinc software after calculating the drought index values using the conventional methods a comparative assessment was conducted between the outcomes of the conventional models and drought indicators including deep soil moisture di1 lower soil moisture di2 root zone soil moisture di3 upper soil moisture di4 and runoff di5 using pearson correlation furthermore a soft computing based drought assessment model that is the fl model was developed and validated using the correlation between the output from the conventional models and drought indicators finally the anfis model was developed to enhance the capability of the fl model through training and testing data over different periods 3 1 conventional drought indices one of the methodological steps of this study was to evaluate drought severity and duration using multiple conventional drought indices at alice springs meteorological stations table 2 summarises the information and description of the conventional drought indices used in this study in addition the table shows the range and number of drought classifications for each index the ranges vary significantly where the negative values indicate dry conditions and the positive values indicate wet conditions in most indices except the pni which ranges from 40 to 120 3 2 soft computing models soft computing techniques including fl and anfis models were used in the present study to assess and monitor drought 3 2 1 fuzzy logic fl fl is a generalisation of the boolean logic that implements the concept of partial truth or uncertainty an element can have gradual membership in different sets within fuzzy set theory this algorithm uses rule based knowledge or if then rules which ease the process for human operators to understand based on knowledge and experimental data gonzalez et al 2016 abdallah et al 2009 fl modelling was developed from the classical boolean set of rules to make decisions where possible outputs are constrained to be 0 or 1 or true or false ngarambe et al 2020 fl was first introduced in 1965 by lotfi zadeh to model and explain complex systems that are difficult to model using classical mathematics manic et al 2016 several advantages distinguish fl from other soft computing methods for example 1 there is no training involved during the model development 2 the fuzzy inference engine accommodate the data uncertainty and 3 the model can be easily reproduced on the other hand the limitations of fl mostly originate from its complete dependency on human expertise and reasoning and its relatively low precision in cases where a very accurate number is needed at the output fortunately the latter limitation is irrelevant in this application as the final results are reported as drought classifications defined over wide ranges fl algorithms have been studied in many applications that require control classification and prediction of nonlinear and time series data systems wilbik et al 2012 fl has been widely used in various drought studies in the literature özger et al 2012 sobhani et al 2019 esfahanian et al 2017 these studies have established the suitability of utilizing fl in assessing and evaluating drought fig 3 shows different components of the fl controller structure including the inputs fuzzifier units databases rule bases fuzzy inference engines defuzzifier units and outputs the algorithm first defines the linguistic variables and terms for instance if the variable to be measured is temperature it is necessary to set a range of degrees to translate the measurement in fuzzy terms 0 1 membership functions must be constructed as they are essential in the fuzzification and defuzzification processes in other words the membership function is used to transform the non fuzzy input values to fuzzy linguistic terms and vice versa moreover fuzzy rules are constructed to control the output variable where the fuzzy rule is a simple if then rule with a condition and consequence after constructing fuzzy membership functions and rules the inference engine combines them to derive the fuzzy output the defuzzification process produces a quantitative outcome based on the membership function creates a lookup table to evaluate each input to its associated output and converts the output data in nonfuzzy values bai and wang 2006 table 3 shows the list of developed fl models in this study along with different inputs used for each model number of membership functions of each model and number of rules it should be noted that the number of membership functions of the output was fixed at five in fl1 nine statements were created to describe the system behaviour under different operating scenarios using the gaussian membership function the following rule is an example of the developed fuzzy rule base statement if rainfall is low maximum temperature is low and pet is low then the fl index is moderately dry table 4 lists all the developed fuzzy rules for the developed f1 model supplementary tables 2 10 provide the list of fuzzy rules defined in the other nine fl models data were obtained from the bureau of meteorology australia and implemented using the developed fuzzy rules the fl system was developed using the fuzzy logic toolbox in matlabtm r2021a 3 2 2 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis model anfis has been effectively utilised for modelling and predicting complex hydrologic systems and processes mokhtarzad et al 2017 this model combines the learning skills of anns and the inference system of fl models tagliabue et al 2021 it eliminates the fundamental problems in fuzzy modelling defining the membership function parameters and design of fuzzy if then rules using anns for automatic fuzzy rule generation and parameter optimization mokhtarzad et al 2017 this study applies the takagi sugeno method to a fuzzy inference system the sugeno output membership functions are either linear or constant making them computationally efficient and compatible with adaptive techniques such as ann the ann learning algorithm was used to tune the parameters of the membership functions during the training process the developed architecture includes nine input membership functions 27 output membership functions and 27 fuzzy rules owing to the numerous interactions between the system components in its complete structure a simplified adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system is shown in fig 4 the simplified anfis model includes two inputs x and y and an output f the anfis architecture developed by jang 1993 includes the following five layers incorporating the computations represented by equations 7 to 11 jang 1993 layer 1 every node in this layer is an adaptive node with a node function that can be computed as 7 o i 1 μ a i t where t is the input to node i and ai is the linguistic label set associated with this node layer 2 every node in this layer is a fixed node labelled π which represents the firing strength w of a fuzzy rule the output of each node is the product of the incoming signals 8 o i 2 w i μ a i t μ b i p layer 3 every node in this layer is a fixed node n which calculates the ratio of each rule s firing strength to the sum of all the rules firing strengths the outputs of this layer are called the normalised firing strengths and can be computed as follows 9 o i 3 w i w i w i w 2 i 1 2 layer 4 every node in this layer is an adaptive node with a node function a linear combination of input variables if p i q i r i is the parameter set then 10 o i 4 w i f i w i p i x q i y r i layer 5 the single node in this layer is a fixed node that computes the overall output as the summation of all the incoming signals 11 o i 5 i w i f i i w i f i i w i the anfis model was built and trained using the fuzzy logic toolbox in matlabtm r2021a table 5 presents the main methods and characteristics of the developed anfis models three inputs rainfall maximum temperature and potential evapotranspiration and two output types were tested in the developed anfis models in the first eight models anfis1 anfis2 to anfis8 the output was the prediction of the average of top performing fl models the second output used in developing the other eight anfis models anfis9 anfis10 to anfis16 was the average normalisation of the top performing conventional drought indices the training size was fixed at 70 of the total data and 30 of the dataset was used for testing the number of training epochs was 1000 and the optimisation method was hybrid the membership function type of the output was constant in the developed models 3 3 drought indicators drought indicators are key indicators for tracking and monitoring drought conditions worldwide hayes et al 2012 the bureau of meteorology and commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro have developed the australian water resources assessment awra model over the last decade operating at the bureau to provide both situational awareness and national retrospective water resource assessment frost et al 2018 the available drought indicators provided by awra typically depend on meteorological agricultural and hydrological parameters such as soil moisture streamflow groundwater levels and runoff steinemann et al 2015 soil moisture data were used to evaluate the performance of the drought models in this study as soil moisture observations are an essential source of information for deducing drought events at the earliest ford et al 2015 in this study four types of soil moisture were used as drought indicators deep soil moisture di1 lower soil moisture di2 root zone soil moisture di3 upper soil moisture di4 and runoff di5 which represented a modelled estimate expected from a small unimpaired catchment 3 4 statistical assessment tools the pearson correlation coefficient is a statistical metric that measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two random variables it has been widely used for many applications such as time delay estimation data analysis and noise reduction benesty et al 2008 the pearson coefficient has been proven to accurately correlate drought indices to their corresponding drought indicators such as soil moisture tian et al 2020 therefore the pearson correlation coefficient was used in the present study as a comparative assessment tool to validate the output of the soft computing models with the drought indicators and outcomes of conventional models additionally two types of non parametric tests of rank correlation coefficients spearman and kendall tau were calculated to examine potential non linear relationships between variables 3 5 model validation table 6 shows the proposed drought classification for the newly developed fl and anfis models the scale and ranges were selected to be compatible with those of most conventional drought indices the scale ranges between 3 0 and 3 0 with 0 5 increments representing extremely dry and wet conditions respectively in addition to the seven stations selected for data collection five different stations in various climate regions around australia were selected to test and validate the developed fl and anfis drought indices precipitation mean temperature maximum temperature pet and soil moisture data were compiled for the middle month of each season in 2019 i e beginning of january april july and october table 7 shows the data collected from the selected stations for validation purposes 4 results and discussion as explained in the methodology section the present study was conducted to assess drought using various drought indices and correlate the outcome of each index with five different drought indicators in this study different fl models were developed and validated via correlations with drought indicators to produce a new meteorological drought index that can be utilized in the future for drought monitoring the correlation was reported through pearson coefficient as it constantly demonstrated greater correlation than spearman and kendall tau rank coefficients thus indicating close to linear relationships between the tested variables this agrees with the correlation measures used by previous studies in the reviewed literature benesty et al 2008 tian et al 2020 4 1 conventional drought indices nine conventional drought indices spi pni czi mczi rai zsi pdsi spei and rdi were computed for alice springs at the seven selected stations the indices were calculated using various software tools based on the computations described in the section 3 the potential evapotranspiration i3 calculation is essential for computing spei and rdi rainfall and temperature i1 and i2 data from 1985 to 2020 were used to calculate i3 at seven meteorological stations the calculated i3 was used to compute the conventional drought indices and formulate the fl and anfis models the computed conventional drought indices are presented in the form of box plots supplementary material figs 1 8 as an example fig 5 shows the temporal variation in spi values for each station from 2005 to 2020 the spi values frequently changed indicating drought fluctuation throughout the study period the spi values were similar for all stations with slight differences to illustrate the variation in spi values table 8 lists the maximum and minimum spi values for each station in the study area the spi classification suggests that positive values indicate a wet climate whereas negative values indicate a dry climate the highest spi value of 2 91 was found in allambi station in september 2010 extremely wet climate while the lowest spi value of 2 17 was found in the garden station in 2019 extreme dryness the results of other conventional drought indices are presented in the supplementary materials file all indices showed extreme values in the dry season particularly in 2009 and 2019 furthermore the overall outcomes of all indices showed slight variation between the considered stations garden station is identified as the driest station whereas allambi station is the wettest station it was found that the spi spei and rdi had a fair degree of agreement where the drought level estimated by each index was in the same range from 3 0 to 3 0 this agrees with the findings reported in the literature tefera et al 2019 haied et al 2017 the czi and mczi had minor differences because in czi the mean precipitation was used in the calculation whereas the median precipitation was used for mczi fig 6 shows the fluctuation of the calculated conventional drought index values of the garden station from 2005 to 2020 however the values shown in the figure are normalised from 0 to 1 because of the variation in the classification ranges of each index the pearson correlation coefficient between the conventional index values and five drought indicators was computed and utilised as a comparative assessment tool to determine the best conventional drought index for the study area fig 7 shows the correlation between each conventional drought index and drought indicators the highest correlation with di1 was noted for pdsi with a coefficient value of 0 596 this can be attributed to the fact that the available water content is used in the computations of the pdsi model hence it is expected to be highly correlated with the deep soil moisture szép et al 2005 rai showed the highest correlation with di2 di3 and di4 with coefficient values of 0 603 0 620 and 0 718 respectively therefore rai was concluded to be the most correlated conventional drought index with drought indicators in contrast di5 had the least correlation with any of the indices with the lowest value of 0 543 for the pdsi these outcomes agreed with those of a previous study that used a similar assessment approach tian et al 2020 developed a hybrid drought index and the findings showed that the hybrid index had a high correlation with the soil moisture measured at a depth of 5 cm which was used as an effective drought indicator 4 2 fuzzy logic fl models ten different fl model structures were developed using the matlab r2021a software to achieve more accurate drought forecasting there are two key strengths of fl models compared to conventional drought indices 1 fl uses linguistic terms and casual rules to describe the well understood relationship between meteorological inputs and drought making it easier to model and accommodate uncertainties in the data and 2 it does not require fitting probability distribution functions the input number of membership functions for the input and output of the fl models were previously discussed in the methodology section table 4 the pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between each developed fl model and the conventional drought indices and is colour coded in descending order in table 9 the correlation between the monthly fl index values and the monthly conventional index values over 1344 data points 7 stations 12 months 16 years was calculated the highest correlation was found between fl1 and zsi 0 818 whereas the lowest correlation was observed between fl10 and pdsi 0 206 a high correlation indicates that there is a strong relationship between the developed fl model and the conventional drought index and vice versa it should be noted that the best performing model fl1 constituted two inputs rainfall and maximum temperature three membership functions for each input and nine fuzzy rules on the other hand the least performing model fl10 was developed using three inputs rainfall mean temperature and potential evapotranspiration five membership functions for the rainfall and mean temperature three membership functions for potential evapotranspiration and 75 fuzzy rules it can be observed that the additional inputs and fuzzy rules resulted in lower performance likely owing to overfitting of the model these results also show the remarkable effect of rainfall and temperature as inputs for a drought index compared to evapotranspiration fig 8 shows the relationship between fl1 and the zsi as an example of the correlation between the fl and conventional indices the trend line in fig 8 shows a linear relationship with r2 0 818 in the present study the majority of the developed fl models had a strong linear relationship that is higher than 0 5 with conventional indices except for the fl5 and fl10 models most studies e g mohammed et al 2022 abbasi et al 2019 and kisi et al 2019 developing a new soft computing based drought model index in the literature have validated the developed models using conventional drought indices this approach was also adopted in this study and the results have been explained above in this study the fl models were further validated by computing pearson correlation coefficients with drought indicators fig 9 shows the correlation between the ten fl models and the selected drought indicators the correlation between the monthly fl index values and drought indicators was calculated over 1344 data points 7 stations 12 months 16 years the highest correlation coefficient 0 784 was observed between fl4 and di4 whereas the lowest correlation was 0 010 between fl10 and di4 a low correlation was observed between fl5 and all the drought indicators these results suggest that fl5 and fl10 were the least accurate drought forecasting models whereas fl1 fl4 and fl9 were the best performing models with the highest correlation with the drought indicator di4 at 0 758 0 784 and 0 757 respectively details on the best performing models are shown in the supplementary tables 11 13 it should be noted that the nonlinear correlation coefficients spearman and kendall tau were calculated between the output of fl4 and the upper soil moisture and were found to be 0 656 and 0 488 respectively compared to a pearson coefficient of 0 784 this emphasizes the appropriateness of linear correlation to test the relationship between drought indices and soil indicators similar to the correlation with conventional indices the highest correlated model fl1 had the lowest number of inputs membership functions and if then rules whereas the least correlated model fl4 constituted three inputs three membership functions and 27 rules it should be noted that the structure of fl4 was similar to that of the highly correlated model fl9 except that the model inputs included the mean temperature instead of the maximum temperature this demonstrates the appropriateness of maximum temperature as an effective input parameter for drought indices along with rainfall these findings agree with those of nasab et al 2018 who developed an fl based drought index and the outcome showed a high correlation between the developed fl based index and calculated conventional drought indices it is worth mentioning that the original contribution of this study is emphasized as four types of soil moisture and nine conventional drought indices were used to examine the prediction capability of the developed soft computing methods 4 3 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis models anfis models were developed to enhance the predictions of fl models by fine tuning the fuzzy parameters based on a multi input single output training dataset in these models two types of outputs were examined 1 the average of the normalised best performing conventional indices and 2 the average of the best performing fl models eight anfis models were developed for each type of output a total of 16 anfis models using different membership functions as described in the methodology the pearson correlation coefficient was computed between each anfis model and all conventional drought indices and is colour coded in descending order in table 10 the correlation between the monthly anfis index values and the monthly conventional index values over 1344 data points 7 stations 12 months 16 years was calculated the highest correlation was found between anfis11 and rai 0 941 whereas the lowest correlation coefficient was 0 529 between anfis6 and pdsi in terms of model structure anfis11 consists of three inputs each with three membership functions one output average normalised top performing conventional indices with 27 generalised bell shaped membership functions and 27 fuzzy rules on the other hand anfis6 had three inputs each with three membership functions one output average top performing fl models with 27 pi shaped membership functions and 27 fuzzy rules moreover it can be stated that the bell shaped membership functions fit the data better as the best performing anfis models employed a generalized bell shaped membership function which was anfis1 as shown in table 10 as explained previously soft computing based models including anfis models were further validated based on the pearson correlation coefficient between the anfis models and multiple drought indicators fig 10 shows the correlation between the 16 anfis models and five drought indicators the correlation between the monthly anfis index values and drought indicators was calculated over 1344 data points 7 stations 12 months 16 years the highest correlation was observed between anfis1 and di4 0 809 whereas the lowest correlation coefficient was 0 206 between anfis6 and di1 in addition a low correlation was observed between anfis14 and most of the drought indicators the highest correlated model anfis1 had the same number of inputs membership functions and rules as anfis14 the lowest correlated model however the membership functions were triangular and the output was the average top performing fl model in anfis1 these differences caused the correlation coefficient with the upper soil moisture to increase from the lowest to the highest value to test the suitability of pearson correlation the rank correlation coefficients spearman and kendall tau were calculated between the output of anfis1 and the upper soil moisture and were found to be 0 699 and 0 528 respectively compared to a pearson coefficient of 0 809 this finding agrees with the linearity check performed for the fl model indicating that pearson coefficient was the best comparative assessment tool to be used in this study to test the performance of the neuro fuzzy model thescatter graphs of the best performing anfis model were plotted for thetraining phase a and testing phase b of the datasets fig 11 showed a strong positive linear relationship between the predicted and observed values of the developed anfis model for drought assessment the slope of both trendlines is slightly above 1 indicating negligible overestimation comparing the performance of the examined fuzzy and neuro fuzzy models it can be noticed that the anfis model outperformed the individual fl models albeit trained on the output of those models this may be expected as the anfis model was trained on the average outputs of the top performing fl models which exhibited varying performance over the broad range of the drought index hence the average of the top performing fl models improved compared to each individual one on the other hand using the average of the conventional indices as the output for the anfis models did not demonstrate as much improvement as that of the fl based anfis models 4 4 model validation to validate the developed models data from five selected stations around australia were compiled at the midpoint of each season in 2019 and utilized shown in table 9 the best performing models i e fl4 and anfis1 were applied to assess drought in the regions of the selected stations using the drought classifications previously illustrated in table 10 these indices were compared with the conventional drought index rai which showed the highest correlation with the soil moisture indicator as shown in table 11 and according to the bureau of meteorology bom the average precipitation was less in 2019 compared to previous years which severely increased drought risks overall the validation results showed that the developed models had similar performance in drought prediction and were matching the outcomes of the best correlated conventional drought index rai in most cases the developed models showed better performance compared to the conventional index within the subtropical region at perth airport station at this station particularly in july rainfall amount was high 101 mm and the developed drought index using fl and anfis predicted near normal to slightly wet conditions however the rai index predicted a very dry condition showing a better prediction outcome by the newly developed models this was also observed at darwin airport station in january on the other hand the developed models did not perform well at darwin airport station in april with a prediction of near normal conditions whereas the actual rainfall was 163 2 mm such inaccuracies could be related to multiple climate features that were not incorporated in the developed models as they theoretically have less effects on drought though they could have still altered the outcomes of the model in a few scenarios these results agreed with nguyen et al 2017 work who investigated the applicability of anfis for drought forecasting and quantitative value of spi and spei drought indices the findings demonstrated that the anfis model has a potential to be successfully applied with high reliability and accuracy for drought forecasting another study by mokhtarzad et al 2017 compared the performance of ann support vector machine svm and anfis for drought predicting using spi the findings showed that compared to ann and anfis the svm model had more accurate forecasting values overall previous studies and the present work have elaborated on the importance and benefits of utilizing soft computing methods in drought monitoring and forecasting 5 conclusion drought is a complex natural phenomenon caused by extreme meteorological conditions including mainly temperature and precipitation the prediction of drought is crucial to mitigate the various adverse impacts on the environment society and economy however as shown in this study the conventional drought indices which are commonly used for drought assessment are sometimes deficient in forecasting drought as their physical models do not effectively cover the wide range of drought conditions and overlook the effect of various influencing environmental features e g land cover use and global warming ai models have been successfully used to accommodate the uncertainty and non linearity of such multi parameter events using the wealth of historical records for measurable meteorological parameters this study was conducted to develop new drought assessment models based on fl and anfis the models were evaluated based on the correlation of their findings with those of nine widely used conventional indices and more effectively with measured drought indicators this study found that the upper soil moisture is more indicative of meteorological drought than runoff and other deeper moisture contents hence the upper soil moisture was used to indicate the severity of drought and the prediction efficiency of the models the models were applied to meteorological data collected for alice springs australia between 1985 and 2020 the study concluded that rai index was the best conventional drought index due to high correlation with drought indicators moreover the highest correlation of the examined fl models was observed between fl4 and di4 with a value of 0 784 whereas a higher correlation was achieved between the anfis1 model and di4 0 809 generally it was found that evapotranspiration had minimal effect on the outcomes of drought indices five stations that were not used in the rule development of the fl model or the training of the anfis model were selected to validate the best performing models fl4 and anfis1 overall the new indices showed accurate drought assessment over diverse geographical and climatological conditions and drought levels compared to the rai conventional index with acceptable efficiency achieved in cases that were not described in the rules and functions however unlike most machine learning models fuzzy logic remains advantageous for its reproducibility and proven effectiveness against uncertainty accurate drought monitoring and prediction through drought indices is essential for successful drought management drought indices are significant components of drought early warning systems which provide timely and precise information on drought conditions an effective early warning system can aid to reduce drought vulnerability and improve the resilience of people and systems under the drought risk therefore this study with investigation of new and accurate fl and anfis based drought indices has a large potential to contribute to the literature as well as policy makers and practitioners in the field the outcomes of this study may lead to several future works that would enrich the relevant literature including 1 incorporating irregular climate patterns e g those related to climate change and variability in the developed models and examining the new indices to forecast potential future drought events under various climate phases 2 testing the use of diverse long term hydro environmental data such as land cover and vegetation in the development training and validation of soft computing methods 3 assessing other drought categories e g hydrological and agricultural using soft computing methods 4 examining other individual and hybrid machine learning approaches as potential dynamic drought indices that continue to improve as more data are fed to the models 5 studying the effects of the drought on water resources including surface and groundwater and other environmental features and 6

2135,drought is a detrimental global warming effect that severely impacts the environment society and economy drought indices are used worldwide for drought monitoring and assessments this study aims to develop a new meteorological drought index based on fuzzy logic fl and neuro fuzzy models to describe and predict droughts the developed models were compared to nine conventional drought indices and correlated with multiple drought indicators different combinations of inputs such as maximum temperature mean temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were tested to develop the models observed weather data from alice springs australia were used to examine the developed models and train the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis model additionally historical records of various drought indicators were used to evaluate the predictions of all models including deep soil moisture lower soil moisture root zone soil moisture upper soil moisture and runoff this study showed that the rainfall anomaly drought index rai was the best conventional drought index with the highest correlation 0 718 between the drought index and upper soil moisture drought indicator the average of the best performing fl models outperformed all conventional indices with a correlation of 0 784 with the upper soil moisture moreover when the average output of the best performing fl models was used for training the best anfis model had a correlation of 0 809 with upper soil moisture the best anfis model in terms of correlation with conventional drought indices had a correlation of 0 941 with the rai when the normalised average output of the best performing conventional drought indices was used for training to validate the developed models drought assessment was conducted for five stations in different climate zones and seasons the validation results showed that the developed models had similar performance to the best correlated conventional drought index rai in most cases the developed models yielded better predictions compared to the conventional index in the subtropical and tropical regions overall the developed soft computing drought indices based on fuzzy logic and anfis outperformed conventional methods thus effectively contributing to more precise drought prediction and mitigation data availability online data source 1 introduction the global surface temperature has been rising drastically during the last century mainly due to anthropogenic reasons and is projected to increase until greenhouse gas ghg emissions are significantly decreased ipcc 2022 on average the temperature had risen by 0 08 c per decade since 1880 and 2020 was the warmest year on record with around 0 98 c warmer than the twentieth century average over the world lindsey and dahlman 2021 this rise in temperature caused variations in precipitation humidity and wind speed these variations especially in precipitation affect stream flow leading to extreme events including floods and droughts trenberth 2011 drought is one of the main consequences of climate change and can vary in duration intensity and frequency jenkins and warren 2015 drought is usually defined as extended periods with below average rainfall causing a shortage of surface water groundwater or both drought can lead to crop destruction soil erosion and severe water supply shortages kalamaras et al 2010 wilhite and glantz 1985 classified drought into four major categories namely meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic the first three categories are used to measure drought as a physical phenomenon on the other hand the fourth drought category i e socioeconomic is used to track the impacts of water deficiency on humanity through socioeconomic systems meteorological drought is stated merely based on the degree of aridity i e receiving less than average rainfall łabędzki and bąk 2014 agricultural drought is associated with meteorological drought with agrarian effects mainly based on precipitation scarcity variation between actual and potential evapotranspiration and soil water shortages the most common definition of agricultural drought is the soil water deficit of a particular crop during a specific period hydrological drought is defined as the low recharge of water from the soil to water resources such as streams lakes and groundwater dutta et al 2015 drought is mainly characterised by six elements namely duration magnitude intensity severity geographic extent and frequency zargar et al 2011 definitions of these drought characteristics are given below the drought duration depends on the region and can fluctuate from days to years on different time scales drought magnitude is the accumulated shortage of water below the threshold during a drought period whereas drought intensity is the ratio of the drought magnitude to its duration drought severity is the degree of impact of a deficit the geographic extent of drought is the spatial distribution of drought the drought frequency is the return period defined as the mean time between drought events with a severity equal to or greater than the threshold zargar et al 2011 drought indices are key tools for drought assessment and management mukherjee et al 2018 which are used to empirically compute and compare drought characteristics such as severity duration and geographic extent across districts with various climatic and hydrological regimes stagge et al 2015 several conventional drought indices have been developed and widely used for drought monitoring to reduce drought impacts multiple studies have investigated the capacity of various drought indices to monitor and assess drought for example loukas et al 2008 used the standardised precipitation index spi to assess drought severity in thessaly greece the index was calculated for multiple timescales 1 3 6 9 and 12 months using data from 50 precipitation stations over 30 years the study showed that the thessaly region experienced frequent moderate and severe droughts in the past and indicated that the future and the far future would face a considerable increase in drought events tefera et al 2019 compared the most common meteorological drought indices that is spi and standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei in the tigray region northern ethiopia the results of this study indicate that spi and spei showed a fair level of agreement haied et al 2017 evaluated drought in algeria using deciles spi and reconnaissance drought index rdi and reported a good correlation between spi and rdi at different time scales proving that these two indices are well adapted to the study area however the rdi which requires precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration data as an input resulted in a more accurate outcome in comparison to the deciles and spi which require precipitation data only as an input for duration and severity assessment despite the widespread use of conventional drought indices they are considered old techniques and their performance varies significantly depending on their input parameters in addition these techniques sometimes lead to uncertain results when adapted to different conditions weng et al 2015 as a good alternative to conventional methods soft computing techniques require less development time minimal input easy implementation and generally low computational costs many studies have adopted soft computing methods for drought monitoring and forecasting for instance abbasi et al 2019 utilized spei and gene expression programming gep model for drought forecasting over various timescales the model accuracy increased from 60 1 in spei1 one month scale to 92 3 in spei48 48 month scale demonstrating that the overall accuracy was enhanced by increasing the scale of spei another study was carried out by kisi et al 2019 who compared the performance of four evolutionary adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis methods after obtaining the monthly precipitation data it was found that when predicting the spi index in various time series the neuro fuzzy methods outperformed the classical anfis method by comparing the rmse of the models keskin et al 2009 applied the spi and an advanced drought analysis model using fuzzy logic fl and anfis for meteorological drought analysis at nine stations in turkey at different time scales the study reported that the anfis model had a high capacity for drought assessment malik et al 2020 established a modern version of the fl model called the co active neuro fuzzy inference system canfis which predicts spi at different time scales at six stations in uttarakhand state india the study compared the spi simulation of canfis with two other models including classical artificial intelligence and regression models and reported that the canfis model predicted spi better than the other two models shirmohammadi et al 2013 forecasted meteorological drought using wavelet ann and anfis hybrid models for various time scales in the south eastern part of azerbaijan province iran this study demonstrated that the anfis model provided more accurate predictions than the artificial neural network ann model few studies e g zhang et al 2019 adnan et al 2015 and bahrami et al 2019 have applied soft computing techniques to predict and assess drought however those studies were limited to simulating the conventional drought indices i e since their training data included the outcomes of the conventional drought index as the true outputs the newly developed ai model could only perform as good as the conventional index used to create it moreover the ai model performance was rarely correlated to various environmental and hydrological drought indicators this study aims to develop a new meteorological drought index based on fl rules describing the relationship between the drought and major meteorological features the specific objectives of this research were to 1 assess the efficiency of conventional meteorological drought indices using correlations with various indicators 2 develop a new fl based drought index and evaluate its capability to predict drought and 3 assess the capacity of the anfis technique to improve predictions from the developed fl based drought index as an original contribution to the literature this comprehensive study aims to incorporate data from conventional indices with soil moisture data to create a better input dataset for the fl and anfis based drought indices the developed methodology is expected to improve the accuracy of drought assessment supporting decision makers in planning and mitigation 2 study area and data australia is the driest inhabited continent in the world as approximately 70 of the country is classified as either arid rainfall less than 250 mm or semi arid rainfall between 250 and 350 mm pilz 2010 fig 1 shows different climate classification zones in australia in the present study the seven selected meteorological stations are located in alice springs in the northern territory in the middle of the australian desert with geographical coordinates of 23 70 s latitude and 133 88 e longitude table 1 lists the details and coordinates of the seven meteorological stations the data were provided by the bureau of meteorology australia national weather and climate agency monthly precipitation maximum and mean temperatures and latitude data from 1985 to 2020 were available for each station in addition to the above mentioned data including precipitation maximum and mean temperature and latitude deep soil moisture lower soil moisture root zone soil moisture upper soil moisture and runoff data were used as drought indicators monthly drought indicator data were available from 2005 to 2020 for all studied stations however as the required data was collected from climatic stations and dated many years ago it is expected that the data are prone to uncertainty due to inaccuracies in measurements human errors and data gaps 3 methodology this study aimed to establish a novel soft computing model for drought monitoring and assessment fig 2 summarises the methodological framework of the study the first step was to collect the input data that is precipitation i1 and maximum mean temperature i2 the other set of collected data was the drought indicators namely deep soil moisture di1 lower soil moisture di2 root zone soil moisture di3 upper soil moisture di4 and runoff di5 for the seven selected meteorological stations in the study area following data collection linear interpolation was used to fill any gaps in the data it should be noted that the available temperature data were collected from four stations alice springs airport kulgera jervois and curtin springs located around the study area whereas the precipitation data were collected from the seven stations listed in table 2 therefore the temperature data were transformed from four stations to seven stations listed in table 2 using the inverse distance weighting method idw several methods are available to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet such as hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1985 thornthwaite thornthwaite 1948 and blaney criddle doorenbos pruitt 1977 in the present study pet was calculated using the thornthwaite method as it is widely used in the field and requires minimal data average temperature and latitude al sudani 2019 according to this method pet can be calculated using equations 1 to 3 thornthwaite 1948 and equations 4 to 6 thornthwaite mather 1957 as follows 1 pet 16 k 10 t i i m 2 i i 1 12 t i 5 1 514 3 m 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 792 10 2 i 0 49239 4 k n 12 ndm 30 n 24 π ω s 5 6 ω s a r c c o s t a n θ t a n δ where t is the average temperature in month i c i is the annual heat index calculated as the sum of 12 monthly index values k is a correction factor n is the maximum number of sun hours ndm is the number of days in a specific month ω s is the hourly angle of the sun θ is the latitude radians and δ is the declination angle of the sun radians the following steps in the methodology were used to estimate drought using conventional methods such as standardised precipitation index spi percent of normal index pni china z index czi modified china z index mczi rainfall anomaly index rai z score index zsi palmer drought severity index pdsi standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and reconnaissance drought index rdi using the dmap software r program and drinc software after calculating the drought index values using the conventional methods a comparative assessment was conducted between the outcomes of the conventional models and drought indicators including deep soil moisture di1 lower soil moisture di2 root zone soil moisture di3 upper soil moisture di4 and runoff di5 using pearson correlation furthermore a soft computing based drought assessment model that is the fl model was developed and validated using the correlation between the output from the conventional models and drought indicators finally the anfis model was developed to enhance the capability of the fl model through training and testing data over different periods 3 1 conventional drought indices one of the methodological steps of this study was to evaluate drought severity and duration using multiple conventional drought indices at alice springs meteorological stations table 2 summarises the information and description of the conventional drought indices used in this study in addition the table shows the range and number of drought classifications for each index the ranges vary significantly where the negative values indicate dry conditions and the positive values indicate wet conditions in most indices except the pni which ranges from 40 to 120 3 2 soft computing models soft computing techniques including fl and anfis models were used in the present study to assess and monitor drought 3 2 1 fuzzy logic fl fl is a generalisation of the boolean logic that implements the concept of partial truth or uncertainty an element can have gradual membership in different sets within fuzzy set theory this algorithm uses rule based knowledge or if then rules which ease the process for human operators to understand based on knowledge and experimental data gonzalez et al 2016 abdallah et al 2009 fl modelling was developed from the classical boolean set of rules to make decisions where possible outputs are constrained to be 0 or 1 or true or false ngarambe et al 2020 fl was first introduced in 1965 by lotfi zadeh to model and explain complex systems that are difficult to model using classical mathematics manic et al 2016 several advantages distinguish fl from other soft computing methods for example 1 there is no training involved during the model development 2 the fuzzy inference engine accommodate the data uncertainty and 3 the model can be easily reproduced on the other hand the limitations of fl mostly originate from its complete dependency on human expertise and reasoning and its relatively low precision in cases where a very accurate number is needed at the output fortunately the latter limitation is irrelevant in this application as the final results are reported as drought classifications defined over wide ranges fl algorithms have been studied in many applications that require control classification and prediction of nonlinear and time series data systems wilbik et al 2012 fl has been widely used in various drought studies in the literature özger et al 2012 sobhani et al 2019 esfahanian et al 2017 these studies have established the suitability of utilizing fl in assessing and evaluating drought fig 3 shows different components of the fl controller structure including the inputs fuzzifier units databases rule bases fuzzy inference engines defuzzifier units and outputs the algorithm first defines the linguistic variables and terms for instance if the variable to be measured is temperature it is necessary to set a range of degrees to translate the measurement in fuzzy terms 0 1 membership functions must be constructed as they are essential in the fuzzification and defuzzification processes in other words the membership function is used to transform the non fuzzy input values to fuzzy linguistic terms and vice versa moreover fuzzy rules are constructed to control the output variable where the fuzzy rule is a simple if then rule with a condition and consequence after constructing fuzzy membership functions and rules the inference engine combines them to derive the fuzzy output the defuzzification process produces a quantitative outcome based on the membership function creates a lookup table to evaluate each input to its associated output and converts the output data in nonfuzzy values bai and wang 2006 table 3 shows the list of developed fl models in this study along with different inputs used for each model number of membership functions of each model and number of rules it should be noted that the number of membership functions of the output was fixed at five in fl1 nine statements were created to describe the system behaviour under different operating scenarios using the gaussian membership function the following rule is an example of the developed fuzzy rule base statement if rainfall is low maximum temperature is low and pet is low then the fl index is moderately dry table 4 lists all the developed fuzzy rules for the developed f1 model supplementary tables 2 10 provide the list of fuzzy rules defined in the other nine fl models data were obtained from the bureau of meteorology australia and implemented using the developed fuzzy rules the fl system was developed using the fuzzy logic toolbox in matlabtm r2021a 3 2 2 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis model anfis has been effectively utilised for modelling and predicting complex hydrologic systems and processes mokhtarzad et al 2017 this model combines the learning skills of anns and the inference system of fl models tagliabue et al 2021 it eliminates the fundamental problems in fuzzy modelling defining the membership function parameters and design of fuzzy if then rules using anns for automatic fuzzy rule generation and parameter optimization mokhtarzad et al 2017 this study applies the takagi sugeno method to a fuzzy inference system the sugeno output membership functions are either linear or constant making them computationally efficient and compatible with adaptive techniques such as ann the ann learning algorithm was used to tune the parameters of the membership functions during the training process the developed architecture includes nine input membership functions 27 output membership functions and 27 fuzzy rules owing to the numerous interactions between the system components in its complete structure a simplified adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system is shown in fig 4 the simplified anfis model includes two inputs x and y and an output f the anfis architecture developed by jang 1993 includes the following five layers incorporating the computations represented by equations 7 to 11 jang 1993 layer 1 every node in this layer is an adaptive node with a node function that can be computed as 7 o i 1 μ a i t where t is the input to node i and ai is the linguistic label set associated with this node layer 2 every node in this layer is a fixed node labelled π which represents the firing strength w of a fuzzy rule the output of each node is the product of the incoming signals 8 o i 2 w i μ a i t μ b i p layer 3 every node in this layer is a fixed node n which calculates the ratio of each rule s firing strength to the sum of all the rules firing strengths the outputs of this layer are called the normalised firing strengths and can be computed as follows 9 o i 3 w i w i w i w 2 i 1 2 layer 4 every node in this layer is an adaptive node with a node function a linear combination of input variables if p i q i r i is the parameter set then 10 o i 4 w i f i w i p i x q i y r i layer 5 the single node in this layer is a fixed node that computes the overall output as the summation of all the incoming signals 11 o i 5 i w i f i i w i f i i w i the anfis model was built and trained using the fuzzy logic toolbox in matlabtm r2021a table 5 presents the main methods and characteristics of the developed anfis models three inputs rainfall maximum temperature and potential evapotranspiration and two output types were tested in the developed anfis models in the first eight models anfis1 anfis2 to anfis8 the output was the prediction of the average of top performing fl models the second output used in developing the other eight anfis models anfis9 anfis10 to anfis16 was the average normalisation of the top performing conventional drought indices the training size was fixed at 70 of the total data and 30 of the dataset was used for testing the number of training epochs was 1000 and the optimisation method was hybrid the membership function type of the output was constant in the developed models 3 3 drought indicators drought indicators are key indicators for tracking and monitoring drought conditions worldwide hayes et al 2012 the bureau of meteorology and commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro have developed the australian water resources assessment awra model over the last decade operating at the bureau to provide both situational awareness and national retrospective water resource assessment frost et al 2018 the available drought indicators provided by awra typically depend on meteorological agricultural and hydrological parameters such as soil moisture streamflow groundwater levels and runoff steinemann et al 2015 soil moisture data were used to evaluate the performance of the drought models in this study as soil moisture observations are an essential source of information for deducing drought events at the earliest ford et al 2015 in this study four types of soil moisture were used as drought indicators deep soil moisture di1 lower soil moisture di2 root zone soil moisture di3 upper soil moisture di4 and runoff di5 which represented a modelled estimate expected from a small unimpaired catchment 3 4 statistical assessment tools the pearson correlation coefficient is a statistical metric that measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two random variables it has been widely used for many applications such as time delay estimation data analysis and noise reduction benesty et al 2008 the pearson coefficient has been proven to accurately correlate drought indices to their corresponding drought indicators such as soil moisture tian et al 2020 therefore the pearson correlation coefficient was used in the present study as a comparative assessment tool to validate the output of the soft computing models with the drought indicators and outcomes of conventional models additionally two types of non parametric tests of rank correlation coefficients spearman and kendall tau were calculated to examine potential non linear relationships between variables 3 5 model validation table 6 shows the proposed drought classification for the newly developed fl and anfis models the scale and ranges were selected to be compatible with those of most conventional drought indices the scale ranges between 3 0 and 3 0 with 0 5 increments representing extremely dry and wet conditions respectively in addition to the seven stations selected for data collection five different stations in various climate regions around australia were selected to test and validate the developed fl and anfis drought indices precipitation mean temperature maximum temperature pet and soil moisture data were compiled for the middle month of each season in 2019 i e beginning of january april july and october table 7 shows the data collected from the selected stations for validation purposes 4 results and discussion as explained in the methodology section the present study was conducted to assess drought using various drought indices and correlate the outcome of each index with five different drought indicators in this study different fl models were developed and validated via correlations with drought indicators to produce a new meteorological drought index that can be utilized in the future for drought monitoring the correlation was reported through pearson coefficient as it constantly demonstrated greater correlation than spearman and kendall tau rank coefficients thus indicating close to linear relationships between the tested variables this agrees with the correlation measures used by previous studies in the reviewed literature benesty et al 2008 tian et al 2020 4 1 conventional drought indices nine conventional drought indices spi pni czi mczi rai zsi pdsi spei and rdi were computed for alice springs at the seven selected stations the indices were calculated using various software tools based on the computations described in the section 3 the potential evapotranspiration i3 calculation is essential for computing spei and rdi rainfall and temperature i1 and i2 data from 1985 to 2020 were used to calculate i3 at seven meteorological stations the calculated i3 was used to compute the conventional drought indices and formulate the fl and anfis models the computed conventional drought indices are presented in the form of box plots supplementary material figs 1 8 as an example fig 5 shows the temporal variation in spi values for each station from 2005 to 2020 the spi values frequently changed indicating drought fluctuation throughout the study period the spi values were similar for all stations with slight differences to illustrate the variation in spi values table 8 lists the maximum and minimum spi values for each station in the study area the spi classification suggests that positive values indicate a wet climate whereas negative values indicate a dry climate the highest spi value of 2 91 was found in allambi station in september 2010 extremely wet climate while the lowest spi value of 2 17 was found in the garden station in 2019 extreme dryness the results of other conventional drought indices are presented in the supplementary materials file all indices showed extreme values in the dry season particularly in 2009 and 2019 furthermore the overall outcomes of all indices showed slight variation between the considered stations garden station is identified as the driest station whereas allambi station is the wettest station it was found that the spi spei and rdi had a fair degree of agreement where the drought level estimated by each index was in the same range from 3 0 to 3 0 this agrees with the findings reported in the literature tefera et al 2019 haied et al 2017 the czi and mczi had minor differences because in czi the mean precipitation was used in the calculation whereas the median precipitation was used for mczi fig 6 shows the fluctuation of the calculated conventional drought index values of the garden station from 2005 to 2020 however the values shown in the figure are normalised from 0 to 1 because of the variation in the classification ranges of each index the pearson correlation coefficient between the conventional index values and five drought indicators was computed and utilised as a comparative assessment tool to determine the best conventional drought index for the study area fig 7 shows the correlation between each conventional drought index and drought indicators the highest correlation with di1 was noted for pdsi with a coefficient value of 0 596 this can be attributed to the fact that the available water content is used in the computations of the pdsi model hence it is expected to be highly correlated with the deep soil moisture szép et al 2005 rai showed the highest correlation with di2 di3 and di4 with coefficient values of 0 603 0 620 and 0 718 respectively therefore rai was concluded to be the most correlated conventional drought index with drought indicators in contrast di5 had the least correlation with any of the indices with the lowest value of 0 543 for the pdsi these outcomes agreed with those of a previous study that used a similar assessment approach tian et al 2020 developed a hybrid drought index and the findings showed that the hybrid index had a high correlation with the soil moisture measured at a depth of 5 cm which was used as an effective drought indicator 4 2 fuzzy logic fl models ten different fl model structures were developed using the matlab r2021a software to achieve more accurate drought forecasting there are two key strengths of fl models compared to conventional drought indices 1 fl uses linguistic terms and casual rules to describe the well understood relationship between meteorological inputs and drought making it easier to model and accommodate uncertainties in the data and 2 it does not require fitting probability distribution functions the input number of membership functions for the input and output of the fl models were previously discussed in the methodology section table 4 the pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between each developed fl model and the conventional drought indices and is colour coded in descending order in table 9 the correlation between the monthly fl index values and the monthly conventional index values over 1344 data points 7 stations 12 months 16 years was calculated the highest correlation was found between fl1 and zsi 0 818 whereas the lowest correlation was observed between fl10 and pdsi 0 206 a high correlation indicates that there is a strong relationship between the developed fl model and the conventional drought index and vice versa it should be noted that the best performing model fl1 constituted two inputs rainfall and maximum temperature three membership functions for each input and nine fuzzy rules on the other hand the least performing model fl10 was developed using three inputs rainfall mean temperature and potential evapotranspiration five membership functions for the rainfall and mean temperature three membership functions for potential evapotranspiration and 75 fuzzy rules it can be observed that the additional inputs and fuzzy rules resulted in lower performance likely owing to overfitting of the model these results also show the remarkable effect of rainfall and temperature as inputs for a drought index compared to evapotranspiration fig 8 shows the relationship between fl1 and the zsi as an example of the correlation between the fl and conventional indices the trend line in fig 8 shows a linear relationship with r2 0 818 in the present study the majority of the developed fl models had a strong linear relationship that is higher than 0 5 with conventional indices except for the fl5 and fl10 models most studies e g mohammed et al 2022 abbasi et al 2019 and kisi et al 2019 developing a new soft computing based drought model index in the literature have validated the developed models using conventional drought indices this approach was also adopted in this study and the results have been explained above in this study the fl models were further validated by computing pearson correlation coefficients with drought indicators fig 9 shows the correlation between the ten fl models and the selected drought indicators the correlation between the monthly fl index values and drought indicators was calculated over 1344 data points 7 stations 12 months 16 years the highest correlation coefficient 0 784 was observed between fl4 and di4 whereas the lowest correlation was 0 010 between fl10 and di4 a low correlation was observed between fl5 and all the drought indicators these results suggest that fl5 and fl10 were the least accurate drought forecasting models whereas fl1 fl4 and fl9 were the best performing models with the highest correlation with the drought indicator di4 at 0 758 0 784 and 0 757 respectively details on the best performing models are shown in the supplementary tables 11 13 it should be noted that the nonlinear correlation coefficients spearman and kendall tau were calculated between the output of fl4 and the upper soil moisture and were found to be 0 656 and 0 488 respectively compared to a pearson coefficient of 0 784 this emphasizes the appropriateness of linear correlation to test the relationship between drought indices and soil indicators similar to the correlation with conventional indices the highest correlated model fl1 had the lowest number of inputs membership functions and if then rules whereas the least correlated model fl4 constituted three inputs three membership functions and 27 rules it should be noted that the structure of fl4 was similar to that of the highly correlated model fl9 except that the model inputs included the mean temperature instead of the maximum temperature this demonstrates the appropriateness of maximum temperature as an effective input parameter for drought indices along with rainfall these findings agree with those of nasab et al 2018 who developed an fl based drought index and the outcome showed a high correlation between the developed fl based index and calculated conventional drought indices it is worth mentioning that the original contribution of this study is emphasized as four types of soil moisture and nine conventional drought indices were used to examine the prediction capability of the developed soft computing methods 4 3 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis models anfis models were developed to enhance the predictions of fl models by fine tuning the fuzzy parameters based on a multi input single output training dataset in these models two types of outputs were examined 1 the average of the normalised best performing conventional indices and 2 the average of the best performing fl models eight anfis models were developed for each type of output a total of 16 anfis models using different membership functions as described in the methodology the pearson correlation coefficient was computed between each anfis model and all conventional drought indices and is colour coded in descending order in table 10 the correlation between the monthly anfis index values and the monthly conventional index values over 1344 data points 7 stations 12 months 16 years was calculated the highest correlation was found between anfis11 and rai 0 941 whereas the lowest correlation coefficient was 0 529 between anfis6 and pdsi in terms of model structure anfis11 consists of three inputs each with three membership functions one output average normalised top performing conventional indices with 27 generalised bell shaped membership functions and 27 fuzzy rules on the other hand anfis6 had three inputs each with three membership functions one output average top performing fl models with 27 pi shaped membership functions and 27 fuzzy rules moreover it can be stated that the bell shaped membership functions fit the data better as the best performing anfis models employed a generalized bell shaped membership function which was anfis1 as shown in table 10 as explained previously soft computing based models including anfis models were further validated based on the pearson correlation coefficient between the anfis models and multiple drought indicators fig 10 shows the correlation between the 16 anfis models and five drought indicators the correlation between the monthly anfis index values and drought indicators was calculated over 1344 data points 7 stations 12 months 16 years the highest correlation was observed between anfis1 and di4 0 809 whereas the lowest correlation coefficient was 0 206 between anfis6 and di1 in addition a low correlation was observed between anfis14 and most of the drought indicators the highest correlated model anfis1 had the same number of inputs membership functions and rules as anfis14 the lowest correlated model however the membership functions were triangular and the output was the average top performing fl model in anfis1 these differences caused the correlation coefficient with the upper soil moisture to increase from the lowest to the highest value to test the suitability of pearson correlation the rank correlation coefficients spearman and kendall tau were calculated between the output of anfis1 and the upper soil moisture and were found to be 0 699 and 0 528 respectively compared to a pearson coefficient of 0 809 this finding agrees with the linearity check performed for the fl model indicating that pearson coefficient was the best comparative assessment tool to be used in this study to test the performance of the neuro fuzzy model thescatter graphs of the best performing anfis model were plotted for thetraining phase a and testing phase b of the datasets fig 11 showed a strong positive linear relationship between the predicted and observed values of the developed anfis model for drought assessment the slope of both trendlines is slightly above 1 indicating negligible overestimation comparing the performance of the examined fuzzy and neuro fuzzy models it can be noticed that the anfis model outperformed the individual fl models albeit trained on the output of those models this may be expected as the anfis model was trained on the average outputs of the top performing fl models which exhibited varying performance over the broad range of the drought index hence the average of the top performing fl models improved compared to each individual one on the other hand using the average of the conventional indices as the output for the anfis models did not demonstrate as much improvement as that of the fl based anfis models 4 4 model validation to validate the developed models data from five selected stations around australia were compiled at the midpoint of each season in 2019 and utilized shown in table 9 the best performing models i e fl4 and anfis1 were applied to assess drought in the regions of the selected stations using the drought classifications previously illustrated in table 10 these indices were compared with the conventional drought index rai which showed the highest correlation with the soil moisture indicator as shown in table 11 and according to the bureau of meteorology bom the average precipitation was less in 2019 compared to previous years which severely increased drought risks overall the validation results showed that the developed models had similar performance in drought prediction and were matching the outcomes of the best correlated conventional drought index rai in most cases the developed models showed better performance compared to the conventional index within the subtropical region at perth airport station at this station particularly in july rainfall amount was high 101 mm and the developed drought index using fl and anfis predicted near normal to slightly wet conditions however the rai index predicted a very dry condition showing a better prediction outcome by the newly developed models this was also observed at darwin airport station in january on the other hand the developed models did not perform well at darwin airport station in april with a prediction of near normal conditions whereas the actual rainfall was 163 2 mm such inaccuracies could be related to multiple climate features that were not incorporated in the developed models as they theoretically have less effects on drought though they could have still altered the outcomes of the model in a few scenarios these results agreed with nguyen et al 2017 work who investigated the applicability of anfis for drought forecasting and quantitative value of spi and spei drought indices the findings demonstrated that the anfis model has a potential to be successfully applied with high reliability and accuracy for drought forecasting another study by mokhtarzad et al 2017 compared the performance of ann support vector machine svm and anfis for drought predicting using spi the findings showed that compared to ann and anfis the svm model had more accurate forecasting values overall previous studies and the present work have elaborated on the importance and benefits of utilizing soft computing methods in drought monitoring and forecasting 5 conclusion drought is a complex natural phenomenon caused by extreme meteorological conditions including mainly temperature and precipitation the prediction of drought is crucial to mitigate the various adverse impacts on the environment society and economy however as shown in this study the conventional drought indices which are commonly used for drought assessment are sometimes deficient in forecasting drought as their physical models do not effectively cover the wide range of drought conditions and overlook the effect of various influencing environmental features e g land cover use and global warming ai models have been successfully used to accommodate the uncertainty and non linearity of such multi parameter events using the wealth of historical records for measurable meteorological parameters this study was conducted to develop new drought assessment models based on fl and anfis the models were evaluated based on the correlation of their findings with those of nine widely used conventional indices and more effectively with measured drought indicators this study found that the upper soil moisture is more indicative of meteorological drought than runoff and other deeper moisture contents hence the upper soil moisture was used to indicate the severity of drought and the prediction efficiency of the models the models were applied to meteorological data collected for alice springs australia between 1985 and 2020 the study concluded that rai index was the best conventional drought index due to high correlation with drought indicators moreover the highest correlation of the examined fl models was observed between fl4 and di4 with a value of 0 784 whereas a higher correlation was achieved between the anfis1 model and di4 0 809 generally it was found that evapotranspiration had minimal effect on the outcomes of drought indices five stations that were not used in the rule development of the fl model or the training of the anfis model were selected to validate the best performing models fl4 and anfis1 overall the new indices showed accurate drought assessment over diverse geographical and climatological conditions and drought levels compared to the rai conventional index with acceptable efficiency achieved in cases that were not described in the rules and functions however unlike most machine learning models fuzzy logic remains advantageous for its reproducibility and proven effectiveness against uncertainty accurate drought monitoring and prediction through drought indices is essential for successful drought management drought indices are significant components of drought early warning systems which provide timely and precise information on drought conditions an effective early warning system can aid to reduce drought vulnerability and improve the resilience of people and systems under the drought risk therefore this study with investigation of new and accurate fl and anfis based drought indices has a large potential to contribute to the literature as well as policy makers and practitioners in the field the outcomes of this study may lead to several future works that would enrich the relevant literature including 1 incorporating irregular climate patterns e g those related to climate change and variability in the developed models and examining the new indices to forecast potential future drought events under various climate phases 2 testing the use of diverse long term hydro environmental data such as land cover and vegetation in the development training and validation of soft computing methods 3 assessing other drought categories e g hydrological and agricultural using soft computing methods 4 examining other individual and hybrid machine learning approaches as potential dynamic drought indices that continue to improve as more data are fed to the models 5 studying the effects of the drought on water resources including surface and groundwater and other environmental features and 6

2136,in the mountainous western u s a considerable portion of water supply originates as snowmelt passing through karst watersheds accurately simulating streamflow in snow dominated karst basins is important for water resources management however this has been challenging due to high spatiotemporal variability of meteorological and hydrogeological processes in these watersheds and scarcity of climate stations to overcome these challenges a physically based snow model is used to simulate snow processes at 100 m resolution and the calculated snowmelt and potential evapotranspiration rates are fed into a deep learning model to simulate streamflow the snow model was driven by meteorological variables from a regional scale weather research and forecasting wrf model or from the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 the two datasets were used both at the original resolution and downscaled to 100 m resolution based on orographic adjustments leading to four sets of forcings snow model simulation results from the four sets of forcings showed large differences in simulated snow water equivalent swe and snowmelt rate and timing however the differences were damped in simulated streamflow as the deep learning model is partially immune to input bias and picked up different streamflow responses to snowmelt and rainfall when trained using snow model results while the meteorological datasets considered yielded close streamflow simulation accuracy averaging simulated streamflow from the four sets of forcings consistently achieved better performance suggesting the value of including multiple meteorological datasets for modeling streamflow in mountainous watersheds keywords snow hydrology karst rainfall runoff modeling deep learning downscaling meteorological uncertainty data availability all data used in this research are publicly available the code used for deep learning models is available at https github com gw asu ueb convlstm model 1 introduction in many mountainous regions of the world much of the water for residential and agriculture use originates as snowpack adam et al 2009 some of these snow dominated watersheds include karst formations where carbonate rock has undergone dissolution resulting in fissures and conduits water is able to flow through karst conduits much faster than in porous matrices karst watersheds supply water to approximately one fourth of the world s population hartmann et al 2014 streamflow in karst snow dominated watersheds is controlled both by snow processes and karst hydrogeology accurate quantification of snow accumulation often measured as snow water equivalence swe and melt in these snow dominated karst regions are essential for simulating streamflow and predicting water supply availability swe levels and melt rates in mountainous regions have high spatial variability due to topography i e elevation slope aspect and canopy coverage and their combined effects on precipitation temperature and radiation shamir and georgakakos 2006 clark et al 2011 winstral et al 2014 in mountainous karst watersheds small scale 1 km spatial variability of snow processes may have a significant effect on the timing and magnitude of streamflow due to hydrogeologic heterogeneity portions of meltwater feed the karst aquifer by entering sinkholes directly connected to karst conduits diffusing through small fissures or fractures or infiltrating the soil matrix that slowly diffuses into karst conduits hartmann et al 2014 spangler 2011 white 2002 depending on where the snowmelt occurs recharge can take a wide range of travel times to reach the stream channel varying from days to years spangler 2011 goldscheider and drew 2014 in addition karst watersheds frequently display piracy where water in one watershed flows across topographic watershed boundaries into neighboring watersheds hartmann et al 2014 spangler 2011 at the mesoscale 100 1000 k m 2 the spatial variability in snow processes can be resolved by high resolution snow modeling schlögl et al 2016 winstral et al 2014 these models require topography e g elevation land use e g canopy coverage and meteorological forcing data at scales appropriate for the model grid size due to the scarcity of ground based observations especially in mountainous areas distributed hydrologic models typically rely on meteorological datasets derived by reanalysis interpolation of ground stations remote sensing techniques or the combination of two or three methods uncertainty in meteorological variables precipitation in particular has been recognized as a key source of uncertainty in hydrologic modeling hong et al 2006 salamon and feyen 2009 strauch et al 2012 eum et al 2014 fallah et al 2020 in addition meteorological data are generally provided at coarse resolutions e g 4 km 0 125 mizukami et al 2016 shamir and georgakakos 2006 methods have been developed for downscaling meteorological variables to the resolution of hydrologic models e g 1 km hungerford et al 1989 liston and elder 2006 thornton et al 2012 fiddes and gruber 2014 sen gupta and tarboton 2016 mital et al 2022 by using fine resolution topography data and adjusting meteorological variables according to known topographical effects on climate unfortunately this downscaling process brings additional uncertainty to the modeling process dibike et al 2008 behnke et al 2016 shuai et al 2022 while numerous studies have applied various hydrologic models to a range of watersheds due to the complexities of karst geology traditional hydrologic models fail to adequately model flow in karst basins therefore a hybrid modeling approach that combines a spatially distributed physically based snow model and a deep learning model has been developed to overcome the lack of information about subsurface hydrologic connectivity that is common in these watersheds xu et al 2022 in this hybrid model the snow model simulates snow accumulation and melt processes at 100 m resolution which are fed into a deep learning model that simulates streamflow response to snowmelt the deep learning model is based on the convlstm architecture shi et al 2015 capable of handling spatiotemporal dynamics such as the precipitation discharge processes in the mountainous karst watersheds unlike physically based or conceptual karst models machine learning and deep learning models do not require site specific knowledge of subsurface hydrologic connectivity li et al 2017 in addition they often do not impose mass balance and use scaled input data e g precipitation or snowmelt while various studies have investigated the effects of meteorological forcing uncertainty on hydrologic modeling using physically based models elsner et al 2014 eum et al 2014 maina et al 2020 shuai et al 2022 rasouli et al 2022 such understanding has been lacking for deep learning models this study aims to understand how the choice of meteorological datasets and downscaling techniques affect simulating snow accumulation melt and streamflow focused on a snow dominated mountainous karst watershed on the utah idaho border we hypothesize that physically based simulation of spatially varying variables such as swe and snowmelt is more sensitive to the uncertainties in meteorological forcing than deep learning based simulation of streamflow to test this hypothesis this study employs modeling experiments to 1 quantify the spatial and temporal patterns of swe and snowmelt rate and how these patterns are affected by the choice of meteorological inputs and downscaling methods and 2 simulate streamflow response to snowmelt which is modeled from different meteorological datasets and downscaling techniques using a deep learning model and determine its accuracy 2 study site our study area is the canyon portion of the logan river watershed located in northeastern utah and southeastern idaho fig 1 a this portion of the logan river watershed has an area of 550 km2 and an elevation range from 1366 m to 3037 m fig 1b the study area contains both coniferous and deciduous forested areas fig 1c average basin average precipitation is about 1080 mm and more than 50 of the precipitation falls as snow according to the weather research forecasting wrf derived meteorological dataset used in this study section 3 1 the river flows primarily from the north and east to the south and west of the watershed however developed karst conduits and sinkholes in the watershed add complexity to subsurface water flow direction the karst features in and around the topographically defined watershed result in significant karst piracy requiring the study area to include terrain outside the topographic watershed particularly in areas with known karst subsurface connections spangler 2011 hydrometeorological data of the study area are available from seven snotel stations among them four stations have data of three or more years and will be used in this study table 1 discharge records of the logan river are provided by usgs station 10 109 000 fig 1 located at the watershed outlet since 1954 two diversions via the highline canal and at the dewitt spring exist upstream of the usgs gage for agricultural and municipal water uses daily diversion rates via the highline canal are obtained from usgs station 10108400 monthly use of dewitt spring discharge was obtained from logan city and assumed to occur evenly over each month daily naturalized streamflow was determined by summing the observed streamflow at the usgs gage and the two diversion rates the combined rates from the three sites are hereafter referred to as observed streamflow 3 methods in order to assess how uncertainty in meteorological forcing would affect the simulation of snow processes and streamflow within the logan river watershed we performed modeling experiments using various meteorological forcing and compare the simulation results fig 2 we used two forcing datasets at their raw resolution and downscaled respectively leading to four sets of meteorological forcing a 100 m spatial resolution and 1 h temporal resolution utah energy balance ueb model mahat and tarboton 2012 tarboton and luce 1996 is used to simulate snowmelt and rainfall the simulated snowmelt and rainfall as well as potential evapotranspiration were fed into the deep learning model to simulate streamflow xu et al 2022 3 1 meteorological forcing and orographic adjustments meteorological variables required to run the ueb model were obtained from two sources of meteorological data the first is a dynamically downscaled dataset based on simulation results of a weather research forecasting wrf model centered on the wasatch mountains utah scalzitti et al 2016 the wrf model used initial and boundary conditions derived from climate forecast system reanalysis the dataset is available at 4 km resolution and hourly time steps from 1985 to 2010 the simulated precipitation was validated using snotel and parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 datasets because it is dynamically downscaled the wrf dataset has an advantage of resolving processes over complex topography at a scale much finer than the resolution of global climate models 50 to hundreds of kilometers the second meteorological dataset is the nldas 2 xia et al 2012 forcing a national dataset commonly used in hydrologic studies the nldas forcing dataset has a 0 125 12 km spatial resolution and 1 h temporal resolution from 1979 to the present non precipitation variables were derived primarily from the ncep north american regional reanalysis narr lin et al 2001 mesinger et al 2006 the narr meteorological variables at 32 km resolution and 3 hourly time steps were spatially interpolated to 0 125 and temporally disaggregated to hourly cosgrove et al 2003 precipitation was derived by temporally disaggregating the climate prediction center cpc prism adjusted daily conus gauge data using hourly doppler stage ii radar available since 1996 lin and mitchell 2005 when the stage ii radar was not available half hourly cmorph available since 2002 joyce et al 2004 cpc hourly precipitation dataset higgins et al 1996 or narr data were used in descending preference ferguson and mocko 2017 to run the ueb model meteorological variables 2 m humidity surface downward shortwave surface radiation surface downward longwave surface radiation wind speed at 2 m above the surface temperature at 2 m above the surface surface pressure and precipitation were derived from the wrf and nldas datasets both as raw data and with orographic adjustments for raw data simulations each ueb grid is assigned the value of meteorological variables from the location of the ueb grid for orographic adjustment runs the raw meteorological variables were first bilinearly interpolated within the study area and then adjusted to account for elevation and other topographical features using methods developed in liston and elder 2006 and sen gupta and tarboton 2013 detailed in text s1 supplementary material temperature was adjusted using a lapse rate derived from snotel stations in the study area precipitation was adjusted based on a monthly factor and the elevation difference specific humidity was downscaled using elevation adjusted temperature calculated previously and the elevation difference and then converted to relative humidity for the ueb model incoming longwave radiation was altered first according to the adjusted temperature and then by calculating air emissivity for elevation shortwave radiation was altered according to atmospheric pressure that had been altered according to the elevation difference and monthly coefficients for the bristow campbell parameterization of the shortwave radiation as a function of air temperature diurnal range wind was adjusted based on wind direction and the slope aspect and curvature of the grid cell and its neighboring cells 3 2 utah energy balance snow model we simulated snow accumulation and melt at 100 m spatial resolution and 1 h temporal resolution for the study area using the ueb model mahat and tarboton 2012 tarboton and luce 1996 the ueb model is a physically based model utilizing mass and energy balances of the snowpack both on land and intercepted by canopy and can be run using a distributed gridded setup we chose the 100 m resolution to capture the small scale variability in snow accumulation and melt based on preliminary results changing resolution from 200 m to 100 m could cause swe differing by more than 20 at model grids having the largest variabilities in slope and aspect due to the smoothing out of aspect and slope however changing resolution from 100 m to 50 m altered swe levels by less than 5 at these grids suggesting 100 m resolution adequately captured slope and aspect at reasonable computational cost the ueb snow model was run for all years the wrf dataset was available oct 1985 jun 2010 ueb simulated hourly swe and the combined snowmelt and rainfall were lumped to daily resolution by taking swe from the last hour of the day and summing up snowmelt and rainfall for each day parameter values were set following recommendations in tarboton and luce 1996 and mahat and tarboton 2012 a digital elevation model dem with 1 3 arc second about 9 m resolution u s geological survey 2017 was coarsened to the 100 m ueb grids and then used to calculate slope and aspect canopy coverage data was obtained from the nlcd 2011 tree canopy dataset coulston et al 2012 leaf area index and forest structure parameters were derived from nlcd land use dataset yang et al 2018 following recommendations in sen gupta and tarboton 2012 canopy height data was obtained from nasa landfire database nelson et al 2013 ueb simulation results are compared with swe observations at snotel stations and modis fractional snow covered area sca product at 500 m resolution mod10a1 hall and riggs 2016 swe recorded at end of day is compared with simulated swe at the ueb grid containing the snotel site the mod10a1 sca product is derived based on normalized difference snow index ndsi the product is known to have lower accuracy in forested areas hall and riggs 2016 yang et al 2015 however it is the only publicly available spatially observed snow dataset with desired coverage and resolution in this study we use mod10a1 as a secondary validation that is independent from snotel stations and provides spatial information to compare mod10a1 sca to ueb results the percent of ueb grids in each mod10a1 grid with swe above 10 mm was calculated to determine the ueb simulated sca experiments showed that varying swe threshold results in negligible difference in sca during december to june 3 3 deep learning karst model a deep learning model using the convolutional long short term memory convlstm architecture is applied to simulate logan river streamflow based on the ueb model outputs the implementation of the architecture used in this work is the same as in xu et al 2022 and shown in fig 3 the convlstm architecture shi et al 2015 integrates convolutional networks into lstm kratzert et al 2018 i t σ w xi x t w hi h t 1 b i f t σ w xf x t w hf h t 1 b f o t w xo x t w ho h t 1 b o c t i t t a n h w xg x t w hg h t 1 b g f t c t

are combined with hidden state from the previous time step h t 1 to determine the input gate i t forget gate f t and output gate o t the cell memory c t contains historical information and is analogous to the watershed storage the input gate controls how new information is used to update the cell memory and the forget gate determines how much of the old cell memory c t 1 will be forgotten the output gate is used to calculate the hidden state h t from the cell memory the convolutional operation applies a filter that sweeps through the spatially distributed x t and h t 1 fig 3 in this way convlstm calculates cell memory of a given grid using information of itself as well as its neighbor grids we stack three layers of convlstm where the hidden state calculated by each layer is used as input by the next layer the hidden state of the third layer at the last time step passes through a fully connected layer to output streamflow q t 1 ueb simulated hourly snowmelt and rainfall combined was lumped to daily to generate inputs to the convlstm model the inputs also include daily potential evapotranspiration pet rates calculated using the hamon method hamon 1960 from the raw and orographically adjusted meteorological forcing respectively the 100 m resolution pet and snowmelt and rainfall were aggregated to 1 6 km resolution grids before being used as inputs to the convlstm model given that the ueb simulation uses meteorological datasets downscaled to 100 m resolution the process of scaling results back up seems counterintuitive however the high resolution snow predictions are necessary to capture the spatially varying meteorological forcing and snow accumulation and melt processes as controlled by topography in mountainous areas schlögl et al 2016 winstral et al 2014 to keep the deep learning computational costs reasonable the detailed snow predictions are coarsened but the values representing the larger grid size now accounts for the within grid variability xu et al 2022 because the distribution of streamflow is heavy tailed we performed a nonlinear transformation y ln y 1 where y is the original observed or simulated streamflow next y and the inputs snowmelt and rainfall pet were all normalized i e linearly scaled to the range of 0 1 data from water years wy 1986 2002 and 2003 2010 were used as training and test datasets for the convlstm model dropout was implemented as described in gal and ghahramani 2016a b to mitigate overfitting training was performed using adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 for 500 epochs from the last 100 epochs we save the models at randomly selected 10 epochs during the test period we run each model for 20 times using random dropout masks gal and ghahramani 2016b this results in 200 time series of simulated streamflow for each of the four meteorological forcing the average of 200 realizations was calculated as the final simulated streamflow 3 4 evaluation of simulated streamflow the simulated streamflow using two meteorological forcing datasets at their original resolution and downscaled is evaluated using three different statistics percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 root mean

streamflow values respectively r is the correlation coefficient between y o y m and σ o σ m are the standard deviation of y o y m a positive pbias suggests the simulations are overall lower than the measurements while a negative pbias shows the simulations are generally higher than measurements lower rmse and nse and kge closer to one indicate better fit to measurements in addition to the four performance metrics we calculated the time lag between ueb simulated rainfall plus snowmelt and convlstm simulated streamflow as a measure of the timing of streamflow response to snowmelt and rainfall learned by the convlstm model yilmaz et al 2008 this was done by calculating the correlation coefficient between simulated streamflow and snowmelt plus rainfall with varying lags the lag that maximizes the correlation was selected as the time lag signature following the recommendation in yilmaz et al 2008 the calculation was performed using high flow with exceedance probability less than or equal to 0 2 the time lag was compared to lag calculated for observed streamflow using raw and orographically adjusted wrf and nldas forcing 4 results 4 1 comparing meteorological variables from different datasets and downscaling methods noticeable differences are found among raw and orographically adjusted wrf and nldas meteorological forcing especially in the amount of precipitation fig 4 during the study period wy 1986 2010 wrf annual cumulative precipitation is 15 5 higher than nldas on average and ranges from nldas being 35 higher than wrf precipitation in 1986 to wrf being 41 higher than nldas in 2006 orographic adjustments increased annual average precipitation by 3 4 for both wrf and nldas less than the difference between the two datasets and with little interannual variation besides precipitation the wrf dataset has overall lower temperature significantly higher incoming shortwave radiation lower incoming longwave radiation higher wind speeds and higher relative humidity than nldas dataset orographic adjustment increased spatial variability suggested by flatter distributions particularly for nldas forcing fig 4 for both datasets orographic adjustment led to overall lower temperature and slightly higher incoming shortwave radiation while its effects on incoming longwave radiation differ between the two datasets 4 2 swe and snowmelt rates simulated using different datasets and downscaling methods the differences in the meteorological forcing propagated to ueb simulated swe fig 5 on average during 1986 2010 annual peak swe simulated using the raw wrf dataset is 90 higher than raw nldas and can vary between 19 in 1998 to 170 in 2003 the orographically adjusted wrf dataset resulted in swe levels 9 higher than raw ranging from 7 higher in 1989 to 15 higher in 2001 while orographic adjustment of nldas data results in swe levels increased by an average of 12 ranging from 9 in 1986 to 19 in 2010 the differences in swe are higher than the differences in precipitation due to orographic adjustment and especially the choice of meteorological dataset fig s2 in addition even in years when the nldas dataset had higher precipitation e g wy 1998 wrf still led to higher swe this highlights that the other meteorological variables affected swe levels comparison with snotel swe measurements shows an underestimation of swe using raw nldas forcing in most years especially at the tony grove lake station while overestimation is observed when using raw wrf fig 5 orographic adjustments increased swe for both datasets resulting in higher rmse for wrf while lower rmse for nldas table s2 simulation results from the four sets of meteorological forcing also differ in fractional sca compared to modis sca mod10a1 product hall and riggs 2016 fig 6 the wrf dataset resulted in higher sca than nldas both datasets led to significantly higher sca than mod10a1 mod10a1 is known to have difficulty detecting snow with canopy presence particularly in complex terrains hall and riggs 2016 huang et al 2011 shamir and georgakakos 2006 in the study area we found that the mod10a1 sca tends to be substantially lower than 100 fig s3 s6 while we observed full snow coverage at higher elevations during winter months because of the likely underestimation of mod10a1 sca we focus the comparison on the monthly change of sca rather than the absolute values the nldas forced runs led to similar melt period as the mod10a1 sca product while the wrf forcing yielded later melt by approximately one month for both datasets orographic adjustment slightly delayed snow melt fig 7 further shows spatial distribution of multi year average snowmelt and rainfall in april may and june according to ueb runs forced by the raw and orographically adjusted wrf and nldas forcing results simulated with the raw data show discontinuity patterns due to the coarse resolutions of raw data 4 km for wrf and 12 km for nldas compared to nldas runs the wrf dataset led to lower snowmelt occurring in april and higher snowmelt in june at higher elevations because orographic adjustment led to higher swe levels it yielded higher monthly snowmelt rates occurring at later times 4 3 effects of different melt rate and timing on streamflow simulation testing the performance of the deep learning models using ueb simulated snowmelt driven by the wrf and nldas datasets with and without orographic adjustments illustrated that the wrf dataset led to overestimation of streamflow negative pbias while the nldas dataset led to underestimation positive pbias other performance metrics rmse nse and kge show similar test accuracy among the four deep learning models the wrf driven simulations yielded lower rmse higher nse and higher kge than simulations driven by nldas although the differences in the performance metrics are small orographic adjustment improved streamflow accuracy at a slightly higher degree for nldas than wrf this is likely because orographically adjusting the wrf dataset worsened the overestimation of swe thus deteriorating overestimation of streamflow because wrf and nldas forcing led to offsetting pbias we additionally calculated an ensemble mean as the average of streamflow simulated with raw and orographically adjusted wrf and nldas forcing the ensemble mean yielded overall the best performance suggested by lowest rmse highest nse slightly higher kge and the second lowest pbias table 2 the improvement in rmse and nse yielded by the ensemble mean appears more significant than the differences caused by orographic adjustment and the choice between wrf and nldas datasets the time lag that maximizes correlation between both simulated and observed streamflow and ueb simulated snowmelt and rainfall shows an overall trend where the time lag of simulated streamflow agrees with that of observed streamflow but tends to be slightly higher table 3 driving the ueb model using the wrf dataset led to much shorter lag i e fast response between streamflow and snowmelt than using the nldas dataset and orographic adjustment led to slightly shorter lags observed and simulated streamflow typically exhibits multiple peaks in response to several major snowmelt events figs 8 10 overall wrf driven simulations yielded higher streamflow peaks in may and june than nldas driven simulations resulting in a better fit to observed streamflow in wy 2006 and 2007 figs 8 9 however wrf driven simulations often overestimate streamflow during recession period table 2 fig s7 such as in wy 2009 fig 10 while sometimes underestimate in april and may fig 8a orographic adjustments enhanced late season peaks occurring in june and recession flow but it also can dampen early season peaks fig 9a 10a 5 discussion 5 1 value of representing topographic control on meteorological variables and snow processes the substantially higher precipitation and swe resulting from the wrf dataset than nldas forcing are consistent with findings in other studies he et al 2019 wrzesien et al 2019 that compared the convection permitting regional climate model simulations with statistically downscaled products the differences in precipitation explain only a portion of the gaps in simulated swe resulting from meteorological dataset and downscaling methods fig s2 due to the effects of other meteorological variables primarily air temperature higher air temperatures would result in less precipitation falling as snow as well as accelerate snow melt leading to lower swe similar underestimation of swe and early snowmelt biases have been found in the nldas forcing for other north american mountain areas wrzesien et al 2019 shuai et al 2022 orographic adjustment increased watershed average precipitation and lowered temperature leading to higher simulated swe on the other hand compared to nldas the wrf dataset has higher incoming shortwave radiation and lower longwave radiation which have offsetting effects on swe higher wind speed and lower rh would decrease swe but these factors are likely to have a smaller effect than the other meteorological variables mizukami et al 2014 while the 100 m resolution ueb simulation already accounts for terrain controls on snow processes when the coarse resolution 12 km nldas meteorological forcing is used the ueb model did not capture the snowmelt derived from deep snowpack southwest and east of the watershed fig 7 c g k orographic adjustment overall improved the representation of swe and snowmelt spatial variability figs 5 7 d h l table s2 on the other hand as a dynamically downscaled dataset the 4 km wrf forcing captures the terrain effects on precipitation reasonably well scalzitti et al 2016 he et al 2019 leading to more realistic spatial patterns of snowmelt and rainfall simulated by the ueb model than the raw nldas dataset fig 7 a e i however orographic adjustment increased swe rmse at three of the four snotel stations for wrf table s2 suggesting that it may be unnecessary to further downscale the 4 km resolution wrf forcing this supports previous finding in rasmussen et al 2011 while appearing to differ from maina et al 2020 the latter study found that meteorological forcing generated by wrf simulations at 0 5 km resolution yielded more accurate swe than coarser resolution forcing the different findings indicate that dynamic downscaling as opposed to orographic adjustment may be needed to adequately resolve spatial variabilities of forcing and swe within 4 km resolution despite mixed results with respect to swe simulation accuracy table s2 orographically adjusted wrf and nldas driven ueb runs were able to capture snowmelt from deep snowpacks in high elevations fig 7 representing the spatial variability realistically is important for simulating streamflow as a deep snowpack would sustain streamflow later into summer than a shallow snowpack an additional factor is that due to the karst geology the logan river streamflow may be more sensitive to snowmelt at certain locations than others xu et al 2022 for example in the high elevation areas west of the study area sinkholes and faults developed in outcropped carbonate units form pathways for fast recharge and conduit flow spangler 2001 2011 5 2 effects of differences in simulated snowmelt on the inference of streamflow response to snowmelt and rainfall the overall trend of overestimating streamflow using the wrf dataset and underestimating streamflow using the nldas dataset particularly during spring runoff reflects the differences in simulated snowmelt figs 5 8 10 table 2 because wrf yields overall deeper snowpack that melts later than nldas the resulting simulated streamflow could underestimate in early season while overestimate in late season similarly orographic adjustments led to slightly higher late season streamflow figs 8 10 late season streamflow peaks mostly result from snowmelt at higher elevations this is where the snow melts last and usually has significant enough volume of snowmelt to create major streamflow peaks orographic adjustment increases precipitation while lowering temperature at higher elevations text s1 leading to higher swe and snowmelt volume in june and july fig 7 and therefore larger streamflow peaks despite the large difference in simulated snowmelt timing and rate the convlstm models simulated streamflow with similar accuracy among the runs using raw and orographically adjusted wrf and nldas datasets this observation is consistent with findings in previous studies that streamflow simulated by physically based hydrologic models is less sensitive to the differences in meteorological forcing and resolution than spatially distributed variables such as swe elsner et al 2014 shuai et al 2022 rasouli et al 2022 in this study the differences in snowmelt rate and timing were dampened as they propagated through the convlstm models primarily due to two reasons first the convlstm models used linearly scaled inputs by doing so they rely on the relative information as opposed to absolute values to infer streamflow response to snowmelt and rainfall in addition the learnable weights of convlstm can absorb input biases when the model is trained and compensate for the bias during inference in other words when trained using snowmelt simulated by different meteorological forcing the convlstm models learned different streamflow response to snowmelt and rainfall the convlstm models trained using wrf driven ueb simulation results learned fast streamflow response with 1 4 days of time lag while the convlstm models trained using nldas driven ueb learned a time lag of approximately one month table 3 this is consistent with the one month delay in snowmelt fig 6 the results suggest that the convlstm models are at least partially immune from input bias when such bias is consistent during training and test periods for coarse resolution meteorological dataset such as nldas downscaling to a finer resolution using orographic adjustment overall improved swe and streamflow simulation accuracy although orographically adjusting wrf led to deleterious overestimation of swe it slightly improved streamflow simulation accuracy except for pbias likely due to better representation of deep snowpack and late melt at high elevations it is also noteworthy that the ensemble mean streamflow as the average of four simulations yielded the best performance during the test period table 2 this observation supports the inclusion of multiple meteorological datasets for streamflow simulation in mountainous watersheds wong et al 2021 this is particularly important when utilizing deep learning models for streamflow prediction under projected climate scenarios 6 conclusions we investigated the effects of different meteorological datasets and downscaling methods on snow and streamflow modeling in a snow dominated mountainous karst watershed notable differences were found in the meteorological variables precipitation in particular from two meteorological datasets nldas and wrf orographic adjustment effects are much smaller than the differences between the two datasets the raw and orographically adjusted nldas and wrf datasets were used to drive the ueb model at 100 m resolution the differences in precipitation led to amplified differences in swe and snowmelt highlighting the effects of temperature comparison with observed swe at snotel stations shows overestimation of wrf results and underestimation of nldas results orographic adjustment decreased swe accuracy for wrf while increasing swe accuracy for nldas the results suggest that orographic adjustment is necessary when using coarse resolution meteorological forcing for a mesoscale watershed to capture the spatial distribution of snow processes but may be unnecessary when dynamically downscaled forcing is available at 4 km or a finer resolution snowmelt simulated by the ueb model were fed into a deep learning model to simulate streamflow response to spatiotemporally varied snowmelt despite large differences in swe and snowmelt much smaller differences were observed in simulated streamflow suggesting the deep learning model is at least partially immune to systematic input bias due to input scaling and model flexibility to compensate for biases among all experiments streamflow simulated using orographically adjusted wrf dataset resulted in overall higher accuracy although the improvement in performance metrics contributed by orographic adjustment is smaller for the wrf dataset than for nldas the improvement is likely due to a better representation of snow accumulation and melt at high elevation areas that overlap with concentrated recharge locations our results underline the value of dynamically downscaled meteorological datasets as well as orographically adjusting coarse resolution datasets when the former is unavailable for modeling streamflow in mountainous watersheds in addition ensemble analyses using multiple

2136,in the mountainous western u s a considerable portion of water supply originates as snowmelt passing through karst watersheds accurately simulating streamflow in snow dominated karst basins is important for water resources management however this has been challenging due to high spatiotemporal variability of meteorological and hydrogeological processes in these watersheds and scarcity of climate stations to overcome these challenges a physically based snow model is used to simulate snow processes at 100 m resolution and the calculated snowmelt and potential evapotranspiration rates are fed into a deep learning model to simulate streamflow the snow model was driven by meteorological variables from a regional scale weather research and forecasting wrf model or from the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 the two datasets were used both at the original resolution and downscaled to 100 m resolution based on orographic adjustments leading to four sets of forcings snow model simulation results from the four sets of forcings showed large differences in simulated snow water equivalent swe and snowmelt rate and timing however the differences were damped in simulated streamflow as the deep learning model is partially immune to input bias and picked up different streamflow responses to snowmelt and rainfall when trained using snow model results while the meteorological datasets considered yielded close streamflow simulation accuracy averaging simulated streamflow from the four sets of forcings consistently achieved better performance suggesting

introduction in many mountainous regions of the world much of the water for residential and agriculture use originates as snowpack adam et al 2009 some of these snow dominated watersheds include karst

temperature and radiation shamir and georgakakos 2006 clark et al 2011 winstral et al 2014 in mountainous karst watersheds small scale 1 km spatial variability of snow processes may have a significant effect on the timing and magnitude of streamflow due to hydrogeologic heterogeneity portions of meltwater feed the karst aquifer by entering sinkholes directly connected to karst conduits diffusing through small fissures or fractures or infiltrating the soil matrix that slowly diffuses into karst conduits hartmann et al 2014 spangler 2011 white 2002 depending on where the snowmelt occurs recharge can take a wide range of travel times to reach the stream channel varying from days to years spangler 2011 goldscheider and drew 2014 in addition karst watersheds frequently display piracy where water in one watershed flows across topographic watershed boundaries into neighboring watersheds hartmann et al 2014 spangler 2011 at the mesoscale 100 1000 k m 2 the spatial variability in snow

data at scales appropriate for the model grid size due to the scarcity of ground based observations especially in mountainous areas distributed hydrologic models typically rely on meteorological datasets derived by reanalysis interpolation of ground stations remote sensing techniques or the combination of two or three methods uncertainty in meteorological variables precipitation in particular has been recognized as a key source of uncertainty in hydrologic modeling hong et al 2006 salamon and feyen 2009 strauch et al 2012 eum et al 2014 fallah et al 2020 in addition meteorological data are

and adjusting meteorological variables according to known topographical effects on climate unfortunately this downscaling process brings additional uncertainty to the modeling process dibike et al 2008 behnke et al 2016 shuai et al 2022 while numerous studies have applied various hydrologic models to a range of watersheds due to the complexities of karst geology traditional hydrologic models fail to adequately model flow in karst basins therefore a hybrid modeling approach that combines a spatially distributed physically based snow model and a deep learning model has been developed to overcome the lack of information about subsurface hydrologic connectivity that is common in these watersheds xu et al 2022 in this hybrid model the snow model simulates snow accumulation and melt processes at 100 m resolution which are fed into a deep learning model that simulates streamflow response to snowmelt the deep learning model is based on the convlstm architecture shi et al 2015 capable of handling spatiotemporal dynamics such as the precipitation discharge processes in the mountainous karst watersheds unlike physically based or conceptual karst models machine learning and deep learning models do not require site specific knowledge of subsurface hydrologic connectivity li et al 2017 in addition they often do not impose mass balance and use scaled input data e g precipitation or snowmelt while various studies have investigated the effects of meteorological forcing uncertainty on hydrologic modeling using physically based models elsner et al 2014 eum et al 2014 maina et al 2020 shuai et al 2022 rasouli et al 2022 such understanding has been lacking for deep learning models this study aims to understand how the choice of meteorological datasets and downscaling techniques affect simulating snow accumulation melt and streamflow focused on a snow dominated mountainous karst watershed on the utah idaho border we hypothesize that physically based simulation of spatially varying variables such as swe and snowmelt is more sensitive to the uncertainties in meteorological forcing than deep learning based simulation of streamflow to test this hypothesis this study employs modeling experiments to 1 quantify the spatial and temporal patterns of swe and snowmelt rate and how these patterns are affected by the choice of meteorological inputs and downscaling methods and 2 simulate streamflow response to snowmelt which is modeled from different meteorological datasets and downscaling techniques using a deep learning model and determine its accuracy 2 study site our study area is the canyon portion of the logan river watershed located in northeastern utah and southeastern idaho fig 1 a this portion of the logan river watershed has an area of 550 km2 and an elevation range from 1366 m to 3037 m fig 1b the study area contains both coniferous and deciduous forested areas fig 1c average basin average precipitation is about 1080 mm and more than 50 of the precipitation falls as snow according to the weather research forecasting wrf derived meteorological dataset used in this study section 3 1 the river flows primarily from the north and east to the south and west of the watershed however developed karst conduits and sinkholes in the watershed add complexity to subsurface water flow direction the karst features in and around the topographically defined watershed result in significant karst piracy requiring the study area to include terrain outside the topographic watershed particularly in areas with known karst subsurface connections spangler 2011 hydrometeorological data of the study area are available from seven snotel stations among them four stations have data of three or more years and will be used in this study table 1 discharge records of the logan river are provided by usgs station 10 109 000 fig 1 located at the watershed outlet since 1954 two diversions via the highline canal and at the dewitt spring exist upstream of the usgs gage for agricultural and municipal water uses daily diversion rates via the highline canal are obtained from usgs station 10108400 monthly use of dewitt spring discharge was obtained from logan city and assumed to occur evenly over each month daily naturalized streamflow was determined by summing the observed streamflow at the usgs gage and the two diversion rates the combined rates from the three sites are hereafter referred to as observed streamflow 3 methods in order to assess how uncertainty in meteorological forcing would affect the simulation of snow processes and streamflow within the logan river watershed we performed modeling experiments using various meteorological forcing and compare the simulation results fig 2 we used two forcing datasets at their raw resolution and downscaled respectively leading to four sets of meteorological forcing a 100 m spatial resolution and 1 h temporal resolution utah energy balance ueb model mahat and tarboton 2012 tarboton and luce 1996 is used to simulate snowmelt and rainfall the simulated snowmelt and rainfall as well as potential evapotranspiration were fed into the deep learning model to simulate streamflow xu et al 2022 3 1 meteorological forcing and orographic adjustments meteorological variables required to run the ueb model were obtained from two sources of meteorological data the first is a dynamically downscaled dataset based on simulation results of a weather research forecasting wrf model centered on the wasatch mountains utah scalzitti et al 2016 the wrf model used initial and boundary conditions derived from climate forecast system reanalysis the dataset is available at 4 km resolution and hourly time steps from 1985 to 2010 the simulated precipitation was validated using snotel and parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 datasets because it is dynamically downscaled the wrf dataset has an advantage of resolving processes over complex topography at a scale much finer than the resolution of global climate models 50 to hundreds of kilometers the second meteorological dataset is the nldas 2 xia et al 2012 forcing a national dataset commonly used in hydrologic studies the nldas forcing dataset has a 0 125 12 km spatial resolution and 1 h temporal resolution from 1979 to the present non precipitation variables were derived primarily from the ncep north american regional reanalysis narr lin et al 2001 mesinger et al 2006 the narr meteorological variables at 32 km resolution and 3 hourly time steps were spatially interpolated to 0 125 and temporally disaggregated to hourly cosgrove et al 2003 precipitation was derived by temporally disaggregating the climate prediction center cpc prism adjusted daily conus gauge data using hourly doppler stage ii radar available since 1996 lin and mitchell 2005 when the stage ii radar was not available half hourly cmorph available since 2002 joyce et al 2004 cpc hourly precipitation dataset higgins et al 1996 or narr data were used in descending preference ferguson and mocko 2017 to run the ueb model meteorological variables 2 m humidity surface downward shortwave surface radiation surface downward longwave surface radiation wind speed at 2 m above the surface temperature at 2 m above the surface surface pressure and precipitation were derived from the wrf and nldas datasets both as raw data and with orographic adjustments for raw data simulations each ueb grid is assigned the value of meteorological variables from the location of the ueb grid for orographic adjustment runs the raw meteorological variables were first bilinearly interpolated within the study area and then adjusted to account for elevation and other topographical features using methods developed in liston and elder 2006 and sen gupta and tarboton 2013 detailed in text s1 supplementary material temperature was adjusted using a lapse rate derived from snotel stations in the study area precipitation was adjusted based on a monthly factor and the elevation difference specific humidity was downscaled using elevation adjusted temperature calculated previously and the elevation difference and then converted to relative humidity for the ueb model incoming longwave radiation was altered first according to the adjusted temperature and then by calculating air emissivity for elevation shortwave radiation was altered according to atmospheric pressure that had been altered according to the elevation difference and monthly coefficients for the bristow campbell parameterization of the shortwave radiation as a function of air temperature diurnal range wind was adjusted based on wind direction and the slope aspect and curvature of the grid cell and its neighboring cells 3 2 utah energy balance snow model we simulated snow accumulation and melt at 100 m spatial resolution and 1 h temporal resolution for the study area using the ueb model mahat and tarboton 2012 tarboton and luce 1996 the ueb model is a physically based model utilizing mass and energy balances of the snowpack both on land and intercepted by canopy and can be run using a distributed gridded setup we chose the 100 m resolution to capture the small scale variability in snow accumulation and melt based on preliminary results changing resolution from 200 m to 100 m could cause swe differing by more than 20 at model grids having the largest variabilities in slope and aspect due to the smoothing out of aspect and slope however changing resolution from 100 m to 50 m altered swe levels by less than 5 at these grids suggesting 100 m resolution adequately captured slope and aspect at reasonable computational cost the ueb snow model was run for all years the wrf dataset was available oct 1985 jun 2010 ueb simulated hourly swe and the combined snowmelt and rainfall were lumped to daily resolution by taking swe from the last hour of the day and summing up snowmelt and rainfall for each day parameter values were set following recommendations in tarboton and luce 1996 and mahat and tarboton 2012 a digital elevation model dem with 1 3 arc second about 9 m resolution u s geological survey 2017 was coarsened to the 100 m ueb grids and then used to calculate slope and aspect canopy coverage data was obtained from the nlcd 2011 tree canopy dataset coulston et al 2012 leaf area index and forest structure parameters were derived from nlcd land use dataset yang et al 2018 following recommendations in sen gupta and tarboton 2012 canopy height data was obtained from nasa landfire database nelson et al 2013 ueb simulation results are compared with swe observations at snotel stations and modis fractional snow covered area sca product at 500 m resolution mod10a1 hall and riggs 2016 swe recorded at end of day is compared with simulated swe at the ueb grid containing the snotel site the mod10a1 sca product is derived based on normalized difference snow index ndsi the product is known to have lower accuracy in forested areas hall and riggs 2016 yang et al 2015 however it is the only publicly available spatially observed snow dataset with desired coverage and resolution in this study we use mod10a1 as a secondary validation that is independent from snotel stations and provides spatial information to compare mod10a1 sca to ueb results the percent of ueb grids in each mod10a1 grid with swe above 10 mm was calculated to determine the ueb simulated sca experiments showed that varying swe threshold results in negligible difference in sca during december to june 3 3 deep learning karst model a deep learning model using the convolutional long short term memory convlstm architecture is applied to simulate logan river streamflow based on the ueb model outputs the implementation of the architecture used in this work is the same as in xu et al 2022 and shown in fig 3 the convlstm architecture shi et al 2015

are combined with hidden state from the previous time step h t 1 to determine the input gate i t forget gate f t and output gate o t the cell memory c t contains historical information and is analogous to the watershed storage the input gate controls how new information is used to update the cell memory and the forget gate determines how much of the old cell memory c t 1 will be forgotten the output gate is used to calculate the hidden state h t from the cell memory the convolutional operation applies a filter that sweeps through the spatially distributed x t and h t 1 fig 3 in this way convlstm calculates cell memory of a given grid using information of itself as well as its neighbor grids we stack three layers of convlstm where the hidden state calculated by each layer is used as input by the next layer the hidden state of the third layer at the last time step passes through a fully connected layer to output streamflow q t 1 ueb simulated hourly snowmelt and rainfall combined was lumped to daily to generate inputs to the convlstm model the inputs also include daily potential evapotranspiration pet rates calculated using the hamon method hamon 1960 from the raw and orographically adjusted meteorological forcing respectively the 100 m resolution pet and snowmelt and rainfall were aggregated to 1 6 km resolution grids before being used as inputs to the convlstm model given that the ueb simulation uses meteorological datasets downscaled to 100 m resolution the process of scaling results back up seems counterintuitive however the high resolution snow predictions are necessary to capture the spatially varying meteorological forcing and snow accumulation and melt processes as controlled by topography in mountainous areas schlögl et al 2016 winstral et al 2014 to keep the deep learning computational costs reasonable the detailed snow predictions are coarsened but the values representing the larger grid size now accounts for the within grid variability xu et al 2022 because the distribution of streamflow is heavy tailed we performed a nonlinear transformation y ln y 1 where y is the original observed or simulated streamflow next y and the inputs snowmelt and rainfall pet were all normalized i e linearly scaled to the range of 0 1 data from water years wy 1986 2002 and 2003 2010 were used as training and test datasets for the convlstm model dropout was implemented as described in gal and ghahramani 2016a b to mitigate overfitting training was performed using adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 for 500 epochs from the last 100 epochs we save the models at randomly selected 10 epochs during the test period we run each model for 20 times using random dropout masks gal and ghahramani 2016b this results in 200 time series of simulated streamflow for each of the four meteorological forcing the average of 200 realizations was calculated as the final simulated streamflow 3 4 evaluation of simulated streamflow the simulated streamflow using two meteorological forcing datasets at their original resolution and downscaled is evaluated using three different statistics percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 root mean

measurements while a negative pbias shows the simulations are generally higher than measurements lower rmse and nse and kge closer to one indicate better fit to measurements in addition to the four performance metrics we calculated the time lag between ueb simulated rainfall plus snowmelt and convlstm simulated streamflow as a measure of the timing of streamflow response to snowmelt and rainfall learned by the convlstm model yilmaz et al 2008 this was done by calculating the correlation coefficient between simulated streamflow and snowmelt plus rainfall with varying lags the lag that maximizes the correlation was selected as the time lag signature following the recommendation in yilmaz et al 2008 the calculation was performed using high flow with exceedance probability less than or equal to 0 2 the time lag was compared to lag calculated for observed streamflow using raw and orographically adjusted wrf and nldas forcing 4 results 4 1 comparing meteorological variables from different datasets and downscaling methods noticeable differences are found among raw and orographically adjusted wrf and nldas meteorological forcing especially in the amount of precipitation fig 4 during the study period wy 1986 2010 wrf annual cumulative precipitation is 15 5 higher than nldas on average and ranges from nldas being 35 higher than wrf precipitation in 1986 to wrf being 41 higher than nldas in 2006 orographic adjustments increased annual average precipitation by 3 4 for both wrf and nldas less than the difference between the two datasets and with little interannual variation besides precipitation the wrf dataset has overall lower temperature significantly higher incoming shortwave radiation lower incoming longwave radiation higher wind speeds and higher relative humidity than nldas dataset orographic adjustment increased spatial variability suggested by flatter distributions particularly for nldas forcing fig 4 for both datasets orographic adjustment led to overall lower temperature and slightly higher incoming shortwave radiation while its effects on incoming longwave radiation differ between the two datasets 4 2 swe and snowmelt rates simulated using different datasets and downscaling methods the differences in the meteorological forcing propagated to ueb simulated swe fig 5 on average during 1986 2010 annual peak swe simulated using the raw wrf dataset is 90 higher than raw nldas and can vary between 19 in 1998 to 170 in 2003 the orographically adjusted wrf dataset resulted in swe levels 9 higher than raw ranging from 7 higher in 1989 to 15 higher in 2001 while orographic adjustment of nldas data results in swe levels increased by an average of 12 ranging from 9 in 1986 to 19 in 2010 the differences in swe are higher than the differences in precipitation due to orographic adjustment and especially the choice of meteorological dataset fig s2 in addition even in years when the nldas dataset had higher precipitation e g wy 1998 wrf still led to higher swe this highlights that the other meteorological variables affected swe levels comparison with snotel swe measurements shows an underestimation of swe using raw nldas forcing in most years especially at the tony grove lake station while overestimation is observed when using raw wrf fig 5 orographic adjustments increased swe for both datasets resulting in higher rmse for wrf while lower rmse for nldas table s2 simulation results from the four sets of meteorological forcing also differ in fractional sca compared to modis sca mod10a1 product hall and riggs 2016 fig 6 the wrf dataset resulted in higher sca than nldas both datasets led to significantly higher sca than mod10a1 mod10a1 is known to have difficulty detecting snow with canopy presence particularly in complex terrains hall and riggs 2016 huang et al 2011 shamir and georgakakos 2006 in the study area we found that the mod10a1 sca tends to be substantially lower than 100 fig s3 s6 while we observed full snow coverage at higher elevations during winter months because of the likely underestimation of mod10a1 sca we focus the comparison on the monthly change of sca rather than the absolute values the nldas forced runs led to similar melt period as the mod10a1 sca product while the wrf forcing yielded later melt by approximately one month for both datasets orographic adjustment slightly delayed snow melt fig 7 further shows spatial distribution of multi year average snowmelt and rainfall in april may and june according to ueb runs forced by the raw and orographically adjusted wrf and nldas forcing results simulated with the raw data show discontinuity patterns due to the coarse resolutions of raw data 4 km for wrf and 12 km for nldas compared to nldas runs the wrf dataset led to lower snowmelt occurring in april and higher snowmelt in june at higher elevations because orographic adjustment led to higher swe levels it yielded higher monthly snowmelt rates occurring at later times 4 3 effects of different melt rate and timing on streamflow simulation testing the performance of the deep learning models using ueb simulated snowmelt driven by the wrf and nldas datasets with and without orographic adjustments illustrated that the wrf dataset led to overestimation of streamflow negative pbias while the nldas dataset led to underestimation positive pbias other performance metrics rmse nse and kge show similar test accuracy among the four deep learning models the wrf driven simulations yielded lower rmse higher nse and higher kge than simulations driven by nldas although the differences in the performance metrics are small orographic adjustment improved streamflow accuracy at a slightly higher degree for nldas than wrf this is likely because orographically adjusting the wrf dataset worsened the overestimation of swe thus deteriorating overestimation of streamflow because wrf and nldas forcing led to offsetting pbias we additionally calculated an ensemble mean as the average of streamflow simulated with raw and orographically adjusted wrf and nldas forcing the ensemble mean yielded overall the best performance suggested by lowest rmse highest nse slightly higher kge and the second lowest pbias table 2 the improvement in rmse and nse yielded by the ensemble mean appears more significant than the differences caused by orographic adjustment and the choice between wrf and nldas datasets the time lag that maximizes correlation between both simulated and observed streamflow and ueb simulated snowmelt and rainfall shows an overall trend where the time lag of simulated streamflow agrees with that of observed streamflow but tends to be slightly higher table 3 driving the ueb model using the wrf dataset led to much shorter lag i e fast response between streamflow and snowmelt than using the nldas dataset and orographic adjustment led to slightly shorter lags observed and simulated streamflow typically exhibits multiple peaks in response to several major snowmelt events figs 8 10 overall wrf driven simulations yielded higher streamflow peaks in may and june than nldas driven simulations resulting in a better fit to observed streamflow in wy 2006 and 2007 figs 8 9 however wrf driven simulations often overestimate streamflow during recession period table 2 fig s7 such as in wy 2009 fig 10 while sometimes underestimate in april and may fig 8a orographic adjustments enhanced late season peaks occurring in june and recession flow but it also can dampen early season peaks fig 9a 10a 5 discussion 5 1 value of representing topographic control on meteorological variables and snow processes the substantially higher precipitation and swe resulting from the wrf dataset than nldas forcing are consistent with findings in other studies he et al 2019 wrzesien et al 2019 that compared the convection permitting regional climate model simulations with statistically downscaled products the differences in precipitation explain only a portion of the gaps in simulated swe resulting from meteorological dataset and downscaling methods fig s2 due to the effects of other meteorological variables primarily air temperature higher air temperatures would result in less precipitation falling as snow as well as accelerate snow melt leading to lower swe similar underestimation of swe and early snowmelt biases have been found in the nldas forcing for other north american mountain areas wrzesien et al 2019 shuai et al 2022 orographic adjustment increased watershed average precipitation and lowered temperature leading to higher simulated swe on the other hand compared to nldas the wrf dataset has higher incoming shortwave radiation and lower longwave radiation which have offsetting effects on swe higher wind speed and lower rh would decrease swe but these factors are likely to have a smaller effect than the other meteorological variables mizukami et al 2014 while the 100 m resolution ueb simulation already accounts for terrain controls on snow processes when the coarse resolution 12 km nldas meteorological forcing is used the ueb model did not capture the snowmelt derived from deep snowpack southwest and east of the watershed fig 7 c g k orographic adjustment overall improved the representation of swe and snowmelt spatial variability figs 5 7 d h l table s2 on the other hand as a dynamically downscaled dataset the 4 km wrf forcing captures the terrain effects on precipitation reasonably well scalzitti et al 2016 he et al 2019 leading to more realistic spatial patterns of snowmelt and rainfall simulated by the ueb model than the raw nldas dataset fig 7 a e i however orographic adjustment increased swe rmse at three of the four snotel stations for wrf table s2 suggesting that it may be unnecessary to further downscale the 4 km resolution wrf forcing this supports previous finding in rasmussen et al 2011 while appearing to differ from maina et al 2020 the latter study found that meteorological forcing generated by wrf simulations at 0 5 km resolution yielded more accurate swe than coarser resolution forcing the different findings indicate that dynamic downscaling as opposed to orographic adjustment may be needed to adequately resolve spatial variabilities of forcing and swe within 4 km resolution despite mixed results with respect to swe simulation accuracy table s2 orographically adjusted wrf and nldas driven ueb runs were able to capture snowmelt from deep snowpacks in high elevations fig 7 representing the spatial variability realistically is important for simulating streamflow as a deep snowpack would sustain streamflow later into summer than a shallow snowpack an additional factor is that due to the karst geology the logan river streamflow may be more sensitive to snowmelt at certain locations than others xu et al 2022 for example in the high elevation areas west of the study area sinkholes and faults developed in outcropped carbonate units form pathways for fast recharge and conduit flow spangler 2001 2011 5 2 effects of differences in simulated snowmelt on the inference of streamflow response to snowmelt and rainfall the overall trend of overestimating streamflow using the wrf dataset and underestimating streamflow using the nldas dataset particularly during spring runoff reflects the differences in simulated snowmelt figs 5 8 10 table 2 because wrf yields overall deeper snowpack that melts later than nldas the resulting simulated streamflow could underestimate in early season while overestimate in late season similarly orographic adjustments led to slightly higher late season streamflow figs 8 10 late season streamflow peaks mostly result from snowmelt at higher elevations this is where the snow melts last and usually has significant enough volume of snowmelt to create major streamflow peaks orographic adjustment increases precipitation while lowering temperature at higher elevations text s1 leading to higher swe and snowmelt volume in june and july fig 7 and therefore larger streamflow peaks despite the large difference in simulated snowmelt timing and rate the convlstm models simulated streamflow with similar accuracy among the runs using raw and orographically adjusted wrf and nldas datasets this observation is consistent with findings in previous studies that streamflow simulated by physically based hydrologic models is less sensitive to the differences in meteorological forcing and resolution than spatially distributed variables such as swe elsner et al 2014 shuai et al 2022 rasouli et al 2022 in this study the differences in snowmelt rate and timing were dampened as they propagated through the convlstm models primarily due to two reasons first the convlstm models used linearly scaled inputs by doing so they rely on the relative information as opposed to absolute values to infer streamflow response to snowmelt and rainfall in addition the learnable weights of convlstm can absorb input biases when the model is trained and compensate for the bias during inference in other words when trained using snowmelt simulated by different meteorological forcing the convlstm models learned different streamflow response to snowmelt and rainfall the convlstm models trained using wrf driven ueb simulation results learned fast streamflow response with 1 4 days of time lag while the convlstm models trained using nldas driven ueb learned a time lag of approximately one month table 3 this is consistent with the one month delay in snowmelt fig 6 the results suggest that the convlstm models are at least partially immune from input bias when such bias is consistent during training and test periods for coarse resolution meteorological dataset such as nldas downscaling to a finer resolution using orographic adjustment overall improved swe and streamflow simulation accuracy although orographically adjusting wrf led to deleterious overestimation of swe it slightly improved streamflow simulation accuracy except for pbias likely due to better representation of deep snowpack and late melt at high elevations it is also noteworthy that the ensemble mean streamflow as the average of four simulations yielded the best performance during the test period table 2 this observation supports the inclusion of multiple meteorological datasets for streamflow simulation in mountainous watersheds wong et al 2021 this is particularly important when utilizing deep learning models for streamflow prediction under projected climate scenarios 6 conclusions we investigated the effects of different meteorological datasets and downscaling methods on snow and streamflow modeling in a snow dominated mountainous karst watershed notable differences were found in the meteorological variables precipitation in particular from two meteorological datasets nldas and wrf orographic adjustment effects are much smaller than the differences between the two datasets the raw and orographically adjusted nldas and wrf datasets were used to drive the ueb model at 100 m resolution the differences in precipitation led to amplified differences in swe and snowmelt highlighting the effects of temperature comparison with observed swe at snotel stations shows overestimation of wrf results and underestimation of nldas results orographic adjustment decreased swe accuracy for wrf while increasing swe accuracy for nldas the results suggest that orographic adjustment is necessary when using coarse resolution meteorological forcing for a mesoscale watershed to capture the spatial distribution of snow processes but may be unnecessary when dynamically downscaled forcing is available at 4 km or a finer resolution snowmelt simulated by the ueb model were fed into a deep learning model to simulate streamflow response to spatiotemporally varied snowmelt despite large differences in swe and snowmelt much smaller differences were observed in simulated streamflow suggesting the deep learning model is at least partially immune to systematic input bias due to input scaling and model flexibility to compensate for biases among all experiments streamflow simulated using orographically adjusted wrf dataset resulted in overall higher accuracy although the improvement in performance metrics contributed by orographic adjustment is smaller for the wrf dataset than for nldas the improvement is likely due to a better representation of snow accumulation and melt at high elevation areas that overlap with concentrated recharge locations our results underline the value of dynamically downscaled meteorological datasets as well as orographically adjusting coarse resolution datasets when the former is unavailable for modeling streamflow in mountainous watersheds in addition ensemble analyses using multiple

2137,the significant impact of soil structure on soil hydraulic properties and then on the associated water and solute transport is well recognized however existing soil hydraulic models that account for the effect of soil structure often at the cost of overparameterization preventing further application in simulation of water and solute transport on large scales in this study we developed a new model that considers the effects of soil structure near saturation in prediction of hydraulic conductivity while introducing no new free parameters testing with 52 soil samples that include different soil types showed that the new model considerably improved the prediction of hydraulic conductivity compared to an earlier version of the model that did not take into account the effects of soil structure the reported root mean square error rmse of the new model is 0 78 cm d 1 much lower than the 0 90 cm d 1 when the earlier version of model is used when the new model was used for fitting observations it performed very well with an rmse of only 0 23 cm d 1 remained for 52 soil samples this new soil hydraulic model provides a simple and practical way to incorporate the influence of soil structure near saturation in water and solute transport simulations data availability the link to the data is shown in the acknowledgements section 1 introduction soil structure which refers to the arrangement of soil pore space e g rabot et al 2018 meurer et al 2020 is an important property that is generally related to the effects of biological activity abiotic factors or tillage practices the significant influence of soil structure such as the presence of macropores on soil hydraulic functions including the soil water retention curve swrc and the hydraulic conductivity curve hcc and therefore on the associated water and solute transport has long been recognized e g dexter 1988 smettem et al 1991 gerke van genuchten 1993 1996 zhang van genuchten 1994 durner 1994 mohanty et al 1997 nimmo 1997 šimůnek et al 2003 dexter et al 2008 jarvis 2007 beven and germann 1982 2013 jarvis et al 2016 vereecken et al 2016 robinson et al 2019 nimmo et al 2021 the significant impact of soil structure on the water cycle has also been recognized for large scale applications for example a recent study by fatichi et al 2020 showed that accounting for soil structure in land surface models can considerably alter the infiltration runoff process especially in wet and vegetated regions bonetti et al 2021 also demonstrated the crucial role of soil structure in the infiltration runoff process in order to capture the effects of soil structure on water and solute transport the first task is to develop a soil hydraulic model that takes into account the effects of soil structure the mostly applied soil hydraulic models such as the van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 model are the unimodal models and do not consider the effects of soil structure early studies such as van genuchten and nielsen 1985 schaap and leij 2000 and schaap et al 2001 have found that when applying the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks as a matching point in predicting the hcc a standard method used by the hydrological community the unimodal models tend to considerably overestimate the unsaturated conductivity especially for fine textured soils van genuchten and nielsen 1985 argued that a new matching point below saturation rather than ks should be applied in predicting the hcc which unsurprisingly will underestimate the hydraulic conductivity at and near saturation from a hydrologic point of view the primary effect of soil structure is more pronounced at and near saturated conditions mostly reflected in the saturated or near saturated hydraulic conductivity in contrast soil texture matrix mainly controls the unsaturated flow therefore a simple way to represent the effects of soil structure in a soil hydraulic model is to separate the hydraulic conductivity function into a soil structure dominated zone and a soil matrix dominated zone such models developed by jarvis et al 1991 larsbo et al 2005 børgesen et al 2006 and schaap and van genuchten 2006 introduced a new parameter of the saturated matrix hydraulic conductivity above which the soil structure controls the water flow to predict the hcc from swrc therefore two matching points of ks and saturated matrix hydraulic conductivity are needed these hydraulic functions were generally used in dual permeability models that do not require knowledge of the water retention curve near saturation larsbo et al 2005 in contrast to models that focus only on the effects of soil structure on the hcc bimodal or multimodal soil hydraulic models that were well established back to the early 1990s e g othmer et al 1991 ross smettem 1993 durner 1994 capture the effects of soil structure in both the swrc and hcc functions similar to unimodal models only a matching point of ks is needed in predicting the hcc in addition to the parameters defined by the swrc however the developed bi modal models introduce a large number of parameters generally requiring at least three more parameters compared to the commonly applied unimodal models the determination of parameters and then the prediction of hcc rely heavily on the detailed measurements of soil water retention properties in particular near saturation which however are often not available a recent study by zhang et al 2022 also showed that fitting solely the swrc and applying ks as a matching point yield poor estimation of the hcc when using the bimodal model developed by durner 1994 they attributed the poor performance to the fact that most information about bimodality is represented in the hcc rather than the swrc additionally few existing pedotransfer functions ptfs that relate soil hydraulic parameters to more easily measured soil information e g soil texture properties have been developed for bimodal soil hydraulic models that consider the effects of soil structure e g jarvis et al 2013 fatichi et al 2020 consequently the bimodal hydraulic models are rarely used in large scale applications fatichi et al 2020 wang et al 2022a recently proposed a new hcc model through building a physical relationship between the soil matrix controlled conductivity and the swrc the new hcc model has the ability to predict the hcc completely from the swrc without the knowledge of ks however due to not consider the effects of soil structure the hcc model in wang et al 2022a tends to underestimate the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for most soil samples consequently this study aimed to develop and evaluate a novel soil hydraulic model that considers the influence of soil structure near saturation based on the hcc model developed in wang et al 2022a specifically we focus mainly on the impact of soil structure near saturation on the prediction of hcc although it is evident that soil structure also impacts swrc the reason for this is that water flow in macropores is often assumed to be driven mainly by gravity gerke 2006 and the hydraulic conductivity is of greater concern the new model developed has three attractive properties 1 it does not introduce additional free parameters compared to the unimodal soil hydraulic models 2 it has the ability to predict the hcc from the swrc with the known matching point of ks as did the unimodal model and 3 it takes into account the effects of adsorption forces in the dry range 2 model development in this section we first recall the fxw m2 model developed in wang et al 2022a following this we demonstrate the development of the new model that accounts for the effects of soil structure the fxw m2 may underestimate the hydraulic conductivity near saturation due to either the uncaptured impact of soil structure or the underestimated hydraulic conductivity that accounts for the effects of adsorption forces which is applied as a matching point in estimating the hcc therefore to demonstrate the influence of soil structure we also introduce the modified van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 model developed by ippisch et al 2006 termed as the mvgm model hereafter for a given soil sample when the mvgm model overestimates and the fxw m2 model underestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation we conclude that the effects of soil structure are important 2 1 the fxw m2 model developed by wang et al 2022a the fxw m2 model developed by wang et al 2022a is a modification of the original fredlund and xing 1994 wang et al 2018 model the fxw m2 model introduces a new matching point rather than ks in estimating the hcc this new matching point that accounts for the effects of adsorption forces can be estimated directly from the swrc therefore enabling a direct prediction of hcc fully from swrc the swrc of the fxw m2 model is written as 1 s h θ θ s 1 ln 1 h h s h r ln 1 h 0 h s h r γ h γ h s h h s 1 h h s with γ hs being 2 γ h s ln e α h s n m in equations 1 and 2 θ l3 l 3 is the volumetric water content and θs l3 l 3 is the saturated water content h l is the matric potential hr is a shape parameter and is set to 1 5 103cm following fredlund and xing 1994 h 0 which is set as 6 3 106cm according to schneider and goss 2012 is the matric potential corresponding to zero water content hs set to 1 cm according to wang et al 2022a is introduced to overcome the unrealistic decrease near saturation for fine textured soils and α l 1 n and m are the fitted parameters the hcc of the fxw m2 model is expressed as 3 k h θ s b h m γ h m γ h γ h 0 γ h m γ h 0 l 1 1 γ h 1 m 1 1 n 1 1 γ h m 1 m 1 1 n 2 h h s θ s b h m γ h m γ h s γ h 0 γ h m γ h 0 l 1 1 γ h s 1 m 1 1 n 1 1 γ h m 1 m 1 1 n 2 h h s where l has a default value of 3 5 following wang et al 2018 hm set to 1 0 105cm according to wang et al 2022a is a typical matric potential where soil water is assumed to be held solely by the van der waals forces b hm set to 2 693 10 6 cm d 1 is a combination of the film thickness and the specific surface area estimation wang et al 2022a the detailed derivation of b hm can be found in wang et al 2022a equation 3 indicates that the hcc can be fully predicted from the swrc since l and b hm are constants while the other parameters required can be estimated based on equation 1 2 2 accounting for the influence of soil structure the fxw m3 model and the fxw m3 opt model although the fxw m2 model matches the observations well in the medium to dry water content range it underestimates the conductivity near saturation for many soil samples wang et al 2022a this underestimation is attributed mainly to the inability of the fxw m2 model to account for the effects of macroporosity to represent the influence of soil structure in the soil hydraulic model the first step is to define a critical matric potential of ha to distinguish the impact from soil structure and soil texture the corresponding hydraulic conductivity k ha termed also as the saturated matrix hydraulic conductivity can be estimated by equation 3 written as 4 k h a min θ s b h m γ h m γ h a γ h 0 γ h m γ h 0 l 1 1 γ h a 1 m 1 1 n 1 1 γ h m 1 m 1 1 n 2 k s the maximum limitation of ks introduced in equation 4 is to avoid the unrealistic estimation of k ha value by equation 3 for matric potentials lower than ha the hydraulic conductivity can still be estimated by equation 3 when the matric potential is higher than ha the impact of the soil structure becomes to be important here we simply assume that the hydraulic conductivity for a potential higher than ha can be described as a power function of the saturation degree s following campbell 1974 when the matric potential is higher than ha the conductivity is written as 5 k h k s s h n where n is a scaling factor by equaling equation 5 to k ha gives the expression of the scaling factor n written as 6 n ln k h a k s ln s h a resubstituting equation 6 into equation 5 gives the conductivity for matric potentials higher than ha which is written as 7 k h k s s h ln k h a k s ln s h a k s γ h ln k h a k s ln γ h a notably for matric potential that varies from ha to 0 the saturation degree s h is almost the same as γ h wang et al 2016 together with the conductivity described by equation 3 for a matric potential less than ha the new hcc can thus be expressed as 8 k h k h a γ h γ h 0 γ h a γ h 0 l 1 1 γ h 1 m 1 1 n 1 1 γ h a 1 m 1 1 n 2 h h a k s γ h ln k h a k s ln γ h a h h a the value of the threshold potential ha depends on the diameter of the smallest macropore of the individual soil the reported ha varies from approximately 4 cm in børgesen et al 2006 to 40 cm in schaap and van genuchten 2006 in this study the exact value of ha is determined by optimizing the hcc with observations for each soil type when ha is determined the hcc can be directly predicted from the swrc with known ks for the swrc equation 1 can be applied alternatively we can apply the swrc model developed originally by fredlund and xing 1994 that is the new model does not require the introduction of hs as in the fxw m2 model to overcome the unrealistic decrease in hcc for fine textured soils wang et al 2022a the reason for this is that for matric potentials higher than ha a new conductivity function that has a fixed lower boundary of k ha is introduced in the new model equation 8 as a result the hcc of the new model no longer shows an abrupt decrease for values of n close to 1 fig 1 consequently we can apply the simple swrc model developed originally by fredlund and xing 1994 for the new model which is written as 9 θ θ s 1 ln 1 h h r ln 1 h 0 h r γ h equations 8 and 9 provide a simple way to describe the soil hydraulic properties from saturation to oven dryness we refer the new model as the fxw m3 model hereafter both the impact of soil structure and soil texture are represented in the hcc the ability of the fxw m3 model to capture the bimodal shape of the hcc is clearly demonstrated in fig 1 a higher potential of ha and a lower value of l represent a sharp decrease in hydraulic conductivity near saturation however it should be noted that the swrc in the fxw m3 model equation 9 is still a unimodal function as discussed previously in the introduction section the reason for not applying a bimodal swrc is to avoid the cost of overparameterization and the hcc is of more concern than swrc as water flow in macropores is often assumed to be driven by gravity gerke 2006 notably the saturated matrix conductivity k ha of the fxw m3 model can be measured or treated as a free fitted parameter as in other soil hydraulic models developed by jarvis et al 1991 børgesen et al 2006 and schaap and van genuchten 2006 that deal with the influence of soil structure when there is no measurement k ha can also be estimated from the known swrc as a result the fxw m3 model is able to predict the hcc from swrc with the known matching point of ks furthermore both capillary and adsorption forces are considered in the fxw m3 model allowing a better description of soil hydraulic properties in the low water content range e g wang et al 2016 2018 2022b additionally to demonstrate the flexibility of the fxw m3 model in describing the hcc we showed the fitted results by treating k ha ha and l as free fitting parameters we refer the model as the fxw m3 opt model hereafter 2 3 the mvgm model developed by ippisch et al 2006 compared to the original vgm model the mvgm overcomes the unrealistic decrease of conductivity near saturation for especially fine textured soils ippisch et al 2006 when the effects of soil structure are important near saturation the mvgm model tends to overestimate the hydraulic conductivity near saturation schaap et al 2001 the swrc of the mvgm model is described as 10 s c h θ θ r θ s θ r γ vg h γ vg h s h h s 1 h h s with γvg h being 11 γ vg h 1 α vg h n vg m vg where sc is the effective water saturation degree θr is the residual water content and αvg l 1 nvg mvg 1 1 nvg are fitting parameters hs is set to 1 cm following vogel et al 2000 the hcc of the mvgm model is written as 12 k h k s s c l vg 1 1 s c γ vg h s 1 m vg 1 1 n vg 1 1 γ vg h s 1 m vg 1 1 n vg 2 h h s k s h h s where lvg is set as 0 5 3 materials and methods 3 1 datasets the applied datasets were selected from the unsaturated soil hydraulic database unsoda nemes et al 2001 following zhang et al 2022 to ensure that the measured data contains sufficient information near saturation the measured k h dataset should include ks and two more data points at matric potentials higher than 20 cm however when it comes to θ h only five data pairs have measured θs when the requirement of k h is met therefore in order to have a larger amount of data we specified the measured θ h should have at least two data pairs at matric potentials higher than 10 cm meanwhile both θ h and k h should have at least five measured data as a result a total of 52 soil samples were selected among them there were seven samples of sand soils ten samples of sandy loam soils 11 samples of loam soils and 14 samples of silt loam soils for loamy sand silt silty clay and clay soils only a limited data size of one two one three respectively are included 3 2 the optimization procedure and the prediction of hcc we applied four models for comparison including the mvgm model developed in ippisch et al 2006 the fxw m2 model developed in wang et al 2022a and the fxw m3 model and the fxw m3 opt model proposed in this study all the optimized and fixed parameters of different model settings are listed in table 1 first the swrc was fitted with observations to get the parameter sets p α n m θs it should be noted that θs in p is only optimized when there is no observation we apply a bayesian framework to get the posterior distribution of parameters set p in general the posterior distribution of candidate parameter sets p can be expressed as 13 f p θ obs f φ i 1 n θ 1 2 π σ 2 exp θ obs i θ sim p i 2 2 σ 2 where the f φ is the prior parameter distributions f φ θi is the posterior parameter distributions nθ is the number of observations of the water content and θobs and θsim are the measured and simulated water contents respectively σ is the standard deviation of the model error we apply the particle evolution metropolis sequential monte carlo pem smc algorithm developed by zhu et al 2018 to get the posterior parameter distribution to approximate the posterior parameter distribution the pem smc method applies a new sequential monte carlo sampler that incorporates the advantages from genetic algorithm differential evolution and metropolis hasting algorithm to run the pem smc method two critical parameters need to be set including the number of particles and the number of evolutions in this study the number of particles was set to 400 and the number of evolutions was set to 300 we refer the readers to zhu et al 2018 for details when the parameter vector p of the swrc was determined the hcc can be predicted by equations 3 and 14 for the fxw m2 and the mvgm model respectively when it comes to the fxw m3 model the prediction of hcc requires the optimal value of ha for each soil type the optimal value for ha was derived by finding the lowest root mean square error of the hcc estimation for ha varying from 0 1 to 150 cm when the optimal value of ha was derived the hcc was predicted by equation 8 with the known matching point of ks to evaluate the model performance the root mean square error rmselog10 k and the coefficient of determination r2 are calculated the log scale value is applied for the hydraulic conductivity the rmselog10 k is defined as 14 rms e log 10 k 1 n k i 1 n k log 10 k i log 10 k i 2 r2 is defined as 15 r 2 1 i 1 n k log 10 k i log 10 k i 2 i 1 n k log 10 k i log 10 k 2 where log 10 k is the mean value of log 10 k i 4 results 4 1 the optimal values of ha for different soil types fig 2 shows the impact of different values of ha on the performance of the hcc estimation with the fxw m3 model a non zero ha does improve the estimation of hcc represented by a higher value of r2 and a lower value of rmselog10 k the improvement is more pronounced for sand sandy loam loam and silt loam soils when it comes to clay soils only slightly improvement is achieved the optimal value of ha varies for the different soil types of the validated 52 soil samples for sand and loam soils the rmselog10 k decreases and the r2 increases sharply for ha varying from 0 1 to about 50 cm and then changes smoothly for more negative matric potentials yielding an optimized value of ha close to the lower boundary of 150 cm the optimal value of ha is about 27 cm and 8 cm for sandy loam and silt loam soils respectively when it comes to clay soils ha has a much higher optimized value of about 4 cm however it should be kept in mind that the clay soil types have only three soil samples for all the 52 soil samples the optimal value of ha is about 16 cm 4 2 the overall performance in predicting the hcc the optimal value of ha for each soil type is applied in estimating the hcc the model performance for the evaluated 52 soil samples and for the five main soil types are summarized in table 2 among all models the mvgm model shows the poorest performance with the highest rmselog10 k value of 1 46 cm d 1 and the lowest r2 value of 0 69 when evaluating with the 52 soil samples the fxw m2 model substantially improves the prediction of hcc with a much lower rmselog10 k of 0 90 cm d 1 and a higher r2 of 0 86 when taking into account the effects of soil structure the fxw m3 model further improves the prediction of the hcc reducing the rmselog10 k from 0 90 cm d 1 the fxw m2 model to 0 78 cm d 1 and increasing the r2 slightly from 0 86 to 0 88 when treating k ha ha and l as free fitting parameters the fxw m3 opt model a reported rmselog10 k of only 0 23 cm d 1 remains and a much higher r2 of 0 99 was achieved for the five main soil types the mvgm model generally reports the highest values of rmselog10 k except for loam soils where the fxw m2 model has the highest value the fxw m3 model outperforms the mvgm and the fxw m2 models for all five soil types reporting the lowest values of rmselog10 k and the highest values of r2 when treating k ha ha and l as free fitting parameters the fxw m3 opt model achieves a substantial improvement for all soil types with reported rmselog10 k ranging from 0 20 cm d 1 loam and silt loam to 0 36 cm d 1 clay and reported r2 all higher than 0 96 4 3 predicting the hcc for individual soil samples 4 3 1 sand soils seven soil samples belong to sand soil for the swrc fig 3 shows that all models are in excellent agreement with observations for all the seven samples due to the difference in model structure the mvgm model approaches the residual water content while the fxw m2 and fxw m3 models show a decrease trend of water content in very dry conditions however no observation of water retention data is available in very dry range hindering the evaluation of the model performance the observed swrc generally does not exhibit an obviously bimodal shape for sand soils when it comes to hcc prediction the mvgm model underestimates the conductivity of all soils for matric potentials less than about 1000 cm except for soil 4001 which has no observations in this matric potential range fig 3 the mvgm model overestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for soil 4131 as a result the mvgm model reported the highest rmselog10 k value of 1 80 cm d 1 for sand soils table 2 compared to the mvgm model both the fxw m2 and the fxw m3 models improve the prediction of conductivity in dry conditions the fxw m2 model reported a much lower value of rmselog10 k of 0 96 cm d 1 and generally showed a close agreement with observations for soils 4000 4001 and 4650 however mainly for soils 4651 4660 and 4661 the fxw m2 model underestimates the conductivity for almost all the measured matric potential range as a result a much negative value of 149 cm was derived for the optimal ha for the fxw m3 model the fxw m3 model notably improves the prediction of hcc near saturation with the value of rmselog10 k reducing from 0 96 cm d 1 of the fxw m2 model to 0 79 cm d 1 however according to the criteria set for the importance role of soil structure i e the underestimation by the fxw m2 model and the overestimation by the mvgm model of near saturated hydraulic conductivity the effects of soil structure on the seven sandy soils were concluded as not significant when treating k ha ha and l as free fitting parameters a rmselog10 k of only 0 25 cm d 1 remains for the seven soil samples 4 3 2 sandy loam soils for the ten sandy loam soil samples all models are generally in close agreements with observations in fitting the swrc fig 4 and figure s1 the deviation happens for soils 2751 and 2753 fig 4 where the retention data shows an obvious bimodal shape the structure bimodality which may be due to the effects of a bimodal soil particle size distribution dexter et al 2008 occurs generally close to the matric potential of about 1000 cm however the measured hydraulic conductivity does not reach this matric potential range hindering the evaluation of the impact of bimodal swrc on the estimation of hcc the fxw m2 model underestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for all ten sandy loam soils with a reported rmselog10 k of 0 80 cm d 1 and r2 of 0 87 meanwhile the overestimation of the mvgm model in predicting the hcc is noticed for soils 2762 2764 4100 in fig 4 and 4162 4171 in figure s1 indicating clearly the effects of soil structure the reported rmselog10 k is 0 95 cm d 1 and r2 is 0 81 for the mvgm model compared to the fxw m2 model the fxw m3 model improves the prediction of conductivity for all ten sandy loam soils with reported rmselog10 k reduces from 0 80 of the fxw m2 model to 0 64 cm d 1 and r2 increases from 0 87 to 0 92 however for soils 2762 2764 4110 4162 and 4172 the fxw m3 model overestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation indicating a higher ha value than the optimized 27 cm for these five soil samples the model performance can be substantially improved when treating k ha ha and l as free fitting parameters with reported rmselog10 k of 0 21 cm d 1 and r2 of 0 99 remain table 2 4 3 3 loam soils for the 11 loam soils a slight deviation in fitting the swrc is noticed for soils 2601 2602 2611 2750 and 2752 where a bimodal swrc is shown in the mid water content range fig 5 the mvgm model is generally in close agreement with observations when predicting the hcc for seven out of 11 loam soil samples fig 5 for soils 2601 2602 4102 and 4111 the mvgm model overestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation the reported rmselog10 k is 0 88 cm d 1 and r2 is 0 89 the fxw m2 model underestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for almost all 11 loam soil samples reporting a higher rmselog10 k of 1 07 cm d 1 and a lower r2 of 0 86 than those reported by the mvgm model table 2 the critical matric potential for the fxw m2 model to underestimate the hydraulic conductivity ranged from about 10 cm for soils 2604 2752 4101 and 4102 to negative hundreds of cm for soils 2611 2741 2742 2750 as a result the optimal ha of the fxw m3 model is about 132 cm when evaluating with the 11 loam soils according to the criteria set for the importance of soil structure the effects of soil structure are concluded to be important for soils 2601 2602 4102 and 4111 compared to the fxw m2 model the fxw m3 model improves the prediction near saturation for all 11 loam soil samples fig 5 and figure s4 the rmselog10 k decreases from 1 07 cm d 1 of the fxw m2 model to 0 83 cm d 1 of the fxw m3 model and the r2 increases from 0 86 to 0 90 table 2 due to the much negative optimal value of ha the fxw m3 model slightly overestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for soils 2601 4102 and 4111 indicating the ha value is in fact different for different soils the rmselog10 k is only 0 20 cm d 1 and the r2 is 0 99 when treating k ha ha and l as free fitting parameters 4 3 4 silty loam soils all models are generally in close agreement with observations in fitting the swrc except for soils 2612 2613 2760 and 2761 where a bimodal swrc is noticed fig 6 the structure bimodality occurs in the mid water content range where no measurements of hydraulic conductivity are available when it comes to the hcc the mvgm model overestimates while the fxw m2 model underestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for almost all 14 silty loam soils indicating clearly the effects of soil structure the reported rmselog10 k is 1 37 cm d 1 and 0 68 cm d 1 and the r2 is 0 70 and 0 85 for the mvgm and the fxw m2 model respectively table 2 when accounting for the effects of soil structure the fxw m3 model improves the estimation of hcc near saturation in comparison with the fxw m2 model reducing the rmselog10 k from 0 68 cm d 1 of the fxw m2 model to 0 54 cm d 1 and increasing the r2 from 0 85 to 0 92 for the 14 silty loam soils the effects of soil structure are generally important for matric potentials higher than 10 cm treating k ha ha and l as free fitting parameters substantially reduces the rmselog10 k to 0 20 cm d 1 and increases the r2 to 0 98 4 3 5 clay soils the validated clay soils include only three soil samples all three soils show clearly the effects of soil structure indicated by the overestimation of the mvgm model and the underestimation of the fxw m2 model in estimating the near saturated hydraulic conductivity fig 7 the reported rmselog10 k is 2 06 cm d 1 and 0 89 cm d 1 and the r2 is 0 68 and 0 84 for the mvgm model and the fxw m2 model respectively table 2 when applying the fxw m3 model that accounts for the effects of soil structure the rmselog10 k reduces from 0 89 cm d 1 of the fxw m2 model to 0 68 cm d 1 and the r2 increases from 0 84 of the fxw m2 model to 0 94 for three clay soils evaluated the optimal ha has a much higher value of 4 cm than the values of other soil types the fxw m3 opt model that treating k ha ha and l as free fitted parameters reduces further the rmselog10 k to 0 36 cm d 1 and increases the r2 to 0 96 5 discussion 5 1 effects of soil structure on different soil types for the evaluated 52 soil samples the mvgm model developed by ippisch et al 2006 underestimates the hydraulic conductivity in the dry range for almost all seven sand soils while overestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for almost all 14 silt loam soils all three clay soils three out of ten sandy loam soils and three out of 11 loam soils the underestimation as discussed in detail in wang et al 2018 2022a b is because the mvgm model does not consider the effects of adsorption forces which are dominant in dry conditions the overestimation near saturation can be attributed to the application of the matching point ks that is sensitive to the presence of macropores while the mvgm model only accounts for the impact of soil texture van genuchten and nielsen 1985 the fxw m2 model underestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for almost all 52 soil samples the main reason for the underestimation is that the fxw m2 model does not address the impact of soil structure wang et al 2022a besides the uncertainty in estimating the parameter b hm may also be the reason of the underestimation of hydraulic conductivity by the fxw m2 model wang et al 2022a when accounting for the effects of soil structure near saturation the proposed fxw m3 model outperforms the mvgm and the fxw m2 models for almost all 52 soil samples represented by a lower value of rmselog10 k however according to the criteria set only when the mvgm model overestimates while the fxw m2 model underestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation we can conclude that the effects of soil structure near saturation are important for a given soil as a result for the 52 evaluated soil samples the effects of soil structure near saturation are concluded to be important for almost all 14 silt loam soils all three clay soils three out of ten sandy loam soils and three out of 11 loam soils while for all the seven sandy soils seven sandy loam soils and eight loam soils the influence of soil structure near saturation is not significant for the soil samples where the effects of soil structure near saturation are not significant the outperformance of the fxw m3 model to the fxw m2 model can be attributed to the underestimated parameter b hm or k h a the possible underestimation of parameter k h a in the fxw m3 model and the small data size evaluated also explain why the optimal h a has a much negative value close to 150 cm for the evaluated seven sand soils and 11 loam soils for three out of seven sand soils fig 3 and four out of 11 loam soils fig 5 the fxw m3 model considerably underestimated the hydraulic conductivity in the relatively low matric potential range due to the small data size evaluated a much negative value of h a is thus required to give the lowest rmselog10 k according to the definition h a means the critical potential separating the influence of soil structure and soil texture therefore it is expected that h a has a much higher value for example scotter 1978 suggested the critical matric potential h a is about 15 cm to account for macropore børgesen et al 2006 suggested a value of 4 cm whereas jarvis 2007 suggested the value as 10 to 6 cm therefore the optimal h a value derived here for different soil type should not be interpreted strictly as an effect of soil structure when evaluating with all the 52 soil samples the optimal h a value is about 16 cm much close to the reported value in the literature in fact the fitting results of the fxw m3 opt model suggested although h a generally varies in a narrow range the value can be different for different soil sample besides the effects of soil structure near saturation the effects of soil structure in the mid water content range were found for two sandy loam soils three loam soils and five silt loam soils represented by a bimodal shape swrc figs 4 6 dexter et al 2008 also concluded that the bimodal swrc are normal in sandy loam and loamy sand soils while it is less common in pure sand soils this structural bimodality that occurs in the mid water content range could be attributed to the impacts of a bimodal particle size distribution dexter et al 2008 5 2 model limitations when the fxw m3 model is generally in good agreement with observations it underestimates the hydraulic conductivity for about seven out of 52 soil samples as discussed previously this underestimation is attributed to the uncertainty in estimation of b hm or k h a wang et al 2022a presented a detail discussion on the uncertainty in estimating b hm showing many factors such as the applied value of the hamaker constant the ionic concentration tokunaga 2011 and the possible impact of capillary forces in the dry range all have an impact on the estimation of b hm therefore if the saturated matrix hydraulic conductivity k h a is measured it is preferred to use the measured value directly as a matching point another limitation of the fxw m3 model is that it only accounts for the effects of soil structure near saturation for two sandy loam soils three loam soils and five silt loam soils the swrc shows a bimodal shape this structural bimodality that occurs in the mid water content range cannot be captured by the proposed fxw m3 model however it is hard to evaluate the impact of this bimodal swrc on the estimated hydraulic conductivity because the measured hydraulic conductivity generally does not reach this potential range to fully describe the influence of soil structure that occurs both near saturation due to the presence of macropore and far from saturation due to a bimodal particle size distribution the bimodal or multimodal swrc should also be applied in addition to modifying the hcc however as discussed in the introduction section the application of the bimodal or multimodal swrc introduces too many parameters and requires a detailed measurement of water retention data e g othmer et al 1991 ross smettem 1993 durner 1994 this complex bimodal soil hydraulic model may be useful in profile applications but is rarely applied in large scale applications fatichi et al 2020 5 3 data limitations in this study 52 soil samples from the unsoda database were applied for model evaluation however only 18 soil samples of them have more than three measured data pairs and one been still ks for matric potentials higher than 10 cm where soil structure is known to exert a strong influence on hydraulic conductivity jarvis 2007 meanwhile only five soil samples have measured value of θs the limited data size and the limited information close to saturation thus hinder an accurate assessment of the model performance for the ten soil samples that exhibited bimodal swrc the measured hcc generally covered only a relatively high range of matrix potentials as a result it is also difficult to assess the impact of bimodal swrc on hcc prediction 6 concluding remarks in this study we developed a novel model for the prediction of hcc by considering the effects of soil structure near saturation the introduced saturated matrix hydraulic conductivity in the termed fxw m3 model can either be measured using tension infiltrometers jorda et al 2015 or be estimated from the swrc in addition the new fxw m3 model takes into account both the capillary and adsorption forces providing a much better description of soil hydraulic properties in the low water content range compared to the commonly applied capillary based models wang et al 2016 therefore the fxw m3 model accounts for both the impact of soil structure near saturation and soil texture and is able to describe the soil hydraulic properties from saturation to oven dryness compared to the well known van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 model the fxw m3 model introduces no additional free parameters it is worth noting that in the fxw m3 model only the effects of soil structure on hcc are considered while the effects on swrc are considered to be of less concern testing with 52 soil samples suggested the fxw m3 model with k h a estimated from the swrc outperformed the fxw m2 model developed in wang et al 2022a and was generally in close agreement with observations therefore this new fxw m3 model provides an easy and practical way to incorporate the influence of soil structure near saturation in water and solute transport simulations however due to the uncertainty in estimating k h a from the swrc the fxw m3 model may underestimate the hydraulic conductivity for some soil samples indicating it is preferring to use the measured k h a as matching point when available in addition the fxw m3 model also cannot capture the structural bimodality that occurs in the mid water content range which is found in a few soil samples finally only 52 soil samples with limited measurements near saturation were applied for model evaluation therefore a large data size with high quality measurements of soil hydraulic properties are further needed to better assess the performance of the proposed

2137,the significant impact of soil structure on soil hydraulic properties and then on the associated water and solute transport is well recognized however existing soil hydraulic models that account for the effect of soil structure often at the cost of overparameterization preventing further application in simulation of water and solute transport on large scales in this study we developed a new model that considers the effects of soil structure near saturation in prediction of hydraulic conductivity while introducing no new free parameters testing with 52 soil samples that include different soil types showed that the new model considerably improved the prediction of hydraulic conductivity compared to an earlier version of the model that did not take into account the effects of soil structure the reported root mean square error rmse of the new model is 0 78 cm d 1 much lower than the 0 90 cm d 1 when the earlier version of model is used when the new model was used for fitting observations it performed very well with an rmse of only 0 23 cm d 1 remained for 52 soil samples this new soil hydraulic model provides a simple and practical way to incorporate the influence of soil structure near saturation in water and solute transport simulations data availability the link to the data is shown in the acknowledgements section 1 introduction soil structure which refers to the arrangement of soil pore space e g rabot et al 2018 meurer et al 2020 is an important property that is generally related to the effects of biological activity abiotic factors or tillage practices the significant influence of soil structure such as the presence of macropores on soil hydraulic functions including the soil water retention curve swrc and the hydraulic conductivity curve hcc and therefore on the associated water and solute transport has long been recognized e g dexter 1988 smettem et al 1991 gerke van genuchten 1993 1996 zhang van genuchten 1994 durner 1994 mohanty et al 1997 nimmo 1997 šimůnek et al 2003 dexter et al 2008 jarvis 2007 beven and germann 1982 2013 jarvis et al 2016 vereecken et al 2016 robinson et al 2019 nimmo et al 2021 the significant impact of soil structure on the water cycle has also been recognized for large scale applications for example a recent study by fatichi et al 2020 showed that accounting for soil structure in land surface models can considerably alter the infiltration runoff process especially in wet and vegetated regions bonetti et al 2021 also demonstrated the crucial role of soil structure in the infiltration runoff process in order to capture the effects of soil structure on water and solute transport the first task is to develop a soil hydraulic model that takes into account the effects of soil structure the mostly applied soil hydraulic models such as the van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 model are the unimodal models and do not consider the effects of soil structure early studies such as van genuchten and nielsen 1985 schaap and leij 2000 and schaap et al 2001 have found that when applying the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks as a matching point in predicting the hcc a standard method used by the hydrological community the unimodal models tend to considerably overestimate the unsaturated conductivity especially for fine textured soils van genuchten and nielsen 1985 argued that a new matching point below saturation rather than ks should be applied in predicting the hcc which unsurprisingly will underestimate the hydraulic conductivity at and near saturation from a hydrologic point of view the primary effect of soil structure is more pronounced at and near saturated conditions mostly reflected in the saturated or near saturated hydraulic conductivity in contrast soil texture matrix mainly controls the unsaturated flow therefore a simple way to represent the effects of soil structure in a soil hydraulic model is to separate the hydraulic conductivity function into a soil structure dominated zone and a soil matrix dominated zone such models developed by jarvis et al 1991 larsbo et al 2005 børgesen et al 2006 and schaap and van genuchten 2006 introduced a new parameter of the saturated matrix hydraulic conductivity above which the soil structure controls the water flow to predict the hcc from swrc therefore two matching points of ks and saturated matrix hydraulic conductivity are needed these hydraulic functions were generally used in dual permeability models that do not require knowledge of the water retention curve near saturation larsbo et al 2005 in contrast to models that focus only on the effects of soil structure on the hcc bimodal or multimodal soil hydraulic models that were well established back to the early 1990s e g othmer et al 1991 ross smettem 1993 durner 1994 capture the effects of soil structure in both the swrc and hcc functions similar to unimodal models only a matching point of ks is needed in predicting the hcc in addition to the parameters defined by the swrc however the developed bi modal models introduce a large number of parameters generally requiring at least three more parameters compared to the commonly applied unimodal models the determination of parameters and then the prediction of hcc rely heavily on the detailed measurements of soil water retention properties in particular near saturation which however are often not available a recent study by zhang et al 2022 also showed that fitting solely the swrc and applying ks as a matching point yield poor estimation of the hcc when using the bimodal model developed by durner 1994 they attributed the poor performance to the fact that most information about bimodality is represented in the hcc rather than the swrc additionally few existing pedotransfer functions ptfs that relate soil hydraulic parameters to more easily measured soil information e g soil texture properties have been developed for bimodal soil hydraulic models that consider the effects of soil structure e g jarvis et al 2013 fatichi et al 2020 consequently the bimodal hydraulic models are rarely used in large scale applications fatichi et al 2020 wang et al 2022a recently proposed a new hcc model through building a physical relationship between the soil matrix controlled conductivity and the swrc the new hcc model has the ability to predict the hcc completely from the swrc without the knowledge of ks however due to not consider the effects of soil structure the hcc model in wang et al 2022a tends to underestimate the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for most soil samples consequently this study aimed to develop and evaluate a novel soil hydraulic model that considers the influence of soil structure near saturation based on the hcc model developed in wang et al 2022a specifically we focus mainly on the impact of soil structure near saturation on the prediction of hcc although it is evident that soil structure also impacts swrc the reason for this is that water flow in macropores is often assumed to be driven mainly by gravity gerke 2006 and the hydraulic conductivity is of greater concern the new model developed has three attractive properties 1 it does not introduce additional free parameters compared to the unimodal soil hydraulic models 2 it has the ability to predict the hcc from the swrc with the known matching point of ks as did the unimodal model and 3 it takes into account the effects of adsorption forces in the dry range 2 model development in this section we first recall the fxw m2 model developed in wang et al 2022a following this we demonstrate the development of the new model that accounts for the effects of soil structure the fxw m2 may underestimate the hydraulic conductivity near saturation due to either the uncaptured impact of soil structure or the underestimated hydraulic conductivity that accounts for the effects of adsorption forces which is applied as a matching point in estimating the hcc therefore to demonstrate the influence of soil structure we also introduce the modified van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 model developed by ippisch et al 2006 termed as the mvgm model hereafter for a given soil sample when the mvgm model overestimates and the fxw m2 model underestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation we conclude that the effects of soil structure are important 2 1 the fxw m2 model developed by wang et al 2022a the fxw m2 model developed by wang et al 2022a is a modification of the original fredlund and xing 1994 wang et al 2018 model the fxw m2 model introduces a new matching point rather than ks in estimating the hcc this new matching point that accounts for the effects of adsorption forces can be estimated directly from the swrc therefore enabling a direct prediction of hcc fully from swrc the swrc of the fxw m2 model is written as 1 s h θ θ s 1 ln 1 h h s h r ln 1 h 0 h s h r γ h γ h s h h s 1 h h s with γ hs being 2 γ h s ln e α h s n m in equations 1 and 2 θ l3 l 3 is the volumetric water content and θs l3 l 3 is the saturated water content h l is the matric potential hr is a shape parameter and is set to 1 5 103cm following fredlund and xing 1994 h 0 which is set as 6 3 106cm according to schneider and goss 2012 is the matric potential corresponding to zero water content hs set to 1 cm according to wang et al 2022a is introduced to overcome the unrealistic decrease near saturation for fine textured soils and α l 1 n and m are the fitted parameters the hcc of the fxw m2 model is expressed as 3 k h θ s b h m γ h m γ h γ h 0 γ h m γ h 0 l 1 1 γ h 1 m 1 1 n 1 1 γ h m 1 m 1 1 n 2 h h s θ s b h m γ h m γ h s γ h 0 γ h m γ h 0 l 1 1 γ h s 1 m 1 1 n 1 1 γ h m 1 m 1 1 n 2 h h s where l has a default value of 3 5 following wang et al 2018 hm set to 1 0 105cm according to wang et al 2022a is a typical matric potential where soil water is assumed to be held solely by the van der waals forces b hm set to 2 693 10 6 cm d 1 is a combination of the film thickness and the specific surface area estimation wang et al 2022a the detailed derivation of b hm can be found in wang et al 2022a equation 3 indicates that the hcc can be fully predicted from the swrc since l and b hm are constants while the other parameters required can be estimated based on equation 1 2 2 accounting for the influence of soil structure the fxw m3 model and the fxw m3 opt model although the fxw m2 model matches the observations well in the medium to dry water content range it underestimates the conductivity near saturation for many soil samples wang et al 2022a this underestimation is attributed mainly to the inability of the fxw m2 model to account for the effects of macroporosity to represent the influence of soil structure in the soil hydraulic model the first step is to define a critical matric potential of ha to distinguish the impact from soil structure and soil texture the corresponding hydraulic conductivity k ha termed also as the saturated matrix hydraulic conductivity can be estimated by equation 3 written as 4 k h a min θ s b h m γ h m γ h a γ h 0 γ h m γ h 0 l 1 1 γ h a 1 m 1 1 n 1 1 γ h m 1 m 1 1 n 2 k s the maximum limitation of ks introduced in equation 4 is to avoid the unrealistic estimation of k ha value by equation 3 for matric potentials lower than ha the hydraulic conductivity can still be estimated by equation 3 when the matric potential is higher than ha the impact of the soil structure becomes to be important here we simply assume that the hydraulic conductivity for a potential higher than ha can be described as a power function of the saturation degree s following campbell 1974 when the matric potential is higher than ha the conductivity is written as 5 k h k s s h n where n is a scaling factor by equaling equation 5 to k ha gives the expression of the scaling factor n written as 6 n ln k h a k s ln s h a resubstituting equation 6 into equation 5 gives the conductivity for matric potentials higher than ha which is written as 7 k h k s s h ln k h a k s ln s h a k s γ h ln k h a k s ln γ h a notably for matric potential that varies from ha to 0 the saturation degree s h is almost the same as γ h wang et al 2016 together with the conductivity described by equation 3 for a matric potential less than ha the new hcc can thus be expressed as 8 k h k h a γ h γ h 0 γ h a γ h 0 l 1 1 γ h 1 m 1 1 n 1 1 γ h a 1 m 1 1 n 2 h h a k s γ h ln k h a k s ln γ h a h h a the value of the threshold potential ha depends on the diameter of the smallest macropore of the individual soil the reported ha varies from approximately 4 cm in børgesen et al 2006 to 40 cm in schaap and van genuchten 2006 in this study the exact value of ha is determined by optimizing the hcc with observations for each soil type when ha is determined the hcc can be directly predicted from the swrc with known ks for the swrc equation 1 can be applied alternatively we can apply the swrc model developed originally by fredlund and xing 1994 that is the new model does not require the introduction of hs as in the fxw m2 model to overcome the unrealistic decrease in hcc for fine textured soils wang et al 2022a the reason for this is that for matric potentials higher than ha a new conductivity function that has a fixed lower boundary of k ha is introduced in the new model equation 8 as a result the hcc of the new model no longer shows an abrupt decrease for values of n close to 1 fig 1 consequently we can apply the simple swrc model developed originally by fredlund and xing 1994 for the new model which is written as 9 θ θ s 1 ln 1 h h r ln 1 h 0 h r γ h equations 8 and 9 provide a simple way to describe the soil hydraulic properties from saturation to oven dryness we refer the new model as the fxw m3 model hereafter both the impact of soil structure and soil texture are represented in the hcc the ability of the fxw m3 model to capture the bimodal shape of the hcc is clearly demonstrated in fig 1 a higher potential of ha and a lower value of l represent a sharp decrease in hydraulic conductivity near saturation however it should be noted that the swrc in the fxw m3 model equation 9 is still a unimodal function as discussed previously in the introduction section the reason for not applying a bimodal swrc is to avoid the cost of overparameterization and the hcc is of more concern than swrc as water flow in macropores is often assumed to be driven by gravity gerke 2006 notably the saturated matrix conductivity k ha of the fxw m3 model can be measured or treated as a free fitted parameter as in other soil hydraulic models developed by jarvis et al 1991 børgesen et al 2006 and schaap and van genuchten 2006 that deal with the influence of soil structure when there is no measurement k ha can also be estimated from the known swrc as a result the fxw m3 model is able to predict the hcc from swrc with the known matching point of ks furthermore both capillary and adsorption forces are considered in the fxw m3 model allowing a better description of soil hydraulic properties in the low water content range e g wang et al 2016 2018 2022b additionally to demonstrate the flexibility of the fxw m3 model in describing the hcc we showed the fitted results by treating k ha ha and l as free fitting parameters we refer the model as the fxw m3 opt model hereafter 2 3 the mvgm model developed by ippisch et al 2006 compared to the original vgm model the mvgm overcomes the unrealistic decrease of conductivity near saturation for especially fine textured soils ippisch et al 2006 when the effects of soil structure are important near saturation the mvgm model tends to overestimate the hydraulic conductivity near saturation schaap et al 2001 the swrc of the mvgm model is described as 10 s c h θ θ r θ s θ r γ vg h γ vg h s h h s 1 h h s with γvg h being 11 γ vg h 1 α vg h n vg m vg where sc is the effective water saturation degree θr is the residual water content and αvg l 1 nvg mvg 1 1 nvg are fitting parameters hs is set to 1 cm following vogel et al 2000 the hcc of the mvgm model is written as 12 k h k s s c l vg 1 1 s c γ vg h s 1 m vg 1 1 n vg 1 1 γ vg h s 1 m vg 1 1 n vg 2 h h s k s h h s where lvg is set as 0 5 3 materials and methods 3 1 datasets the applied datasets were selected from the unsaturated soil hydraulic database unsoda nemes et al 2001 following zhang et al 2022 to ensure that the measured data contains sufficient information near saturation the measured k h dataset should include ks and two more data points at matric potentials higher than 20 cm however when it comes to θ h only five data pairs have measured θs when the requirement of k h is met therefore in order to have a larger amount of data we specified the measured θ h should have at least two data pairs at matric potentials higher than 10 cm meanwhile both θ h and k h should have at least five measured data as a result a total of 52 soil samples were selected among them there were seven samples of sand soils ten samples of sandy loam soils 11 samples of loam soils and 14 samples of silt loam soils for loamy sand silt silty clay and clay soils only a limited data size of one two one three respectively are included 3 2 the optimization procedure and the prediction of hcc we applied four models for comparison including the mvgm model developed in ippisch et al 2006 the fxw m2 model developed in wang et al 2022a and the fxw m3 model and the fxw m3 opt model proposed in this study all the optimized and fixed parameters of different model settings are listed in table 1 first the swrc was fitted with observations to get the parameter sets p α n m θs it should be noted that θs in p is only optimized when there is no observation we apply a bayesian framework to get the posterior distribution of parameters set p in general the posterior distribution of candidate parameter sets p can be expressed as 13 f p θ obs f φ i 1 n θ 1 2 π σ 2 exp θ obs i θ sim p i 2 2 σ 2 where the f φ is the prior parameter distributions f φ θi is the posterior parameter distributions nθ is the number of observations of the water content and θobs and θsim are the measured and simulated water contents respectively σ is the standard deviation of the model error we apply the particle evolution metropolis sequential monte carlo pem smc algorithm developed by zhu et al 2018 to get the posterior parameter distribution to approximate the posterior parameter distribution the pem smc method applies a new sequential monte carlo sampler that incorporates the advantages from genetic algorithm differential evolution and metropolis hasting algorithm to run the pem smc method two critical parameters need to be set including the number of particles and the number of evolutions in this study the number of particles was set to 400 and the number of evolutions was set to 300 we refer the readers to zhu et al 2018 for details when the parameter vector p of the swrc was determined the hcc can be predicted by equations 3 and 14 for the fxw m2 and the mvgm model respectively when it comes to the fxw m3 model the prediction of hcc requires the optimal value of ha for each soil type the optimal value for ha was derived by finding the lowest root mean square error of the hcc estimation for ha varying from 0 1 to 150 cm when the optimal value of ha was derived the hcc was predicted by equation 8 with the known matching point of ks to evaluate the model performance the root mean square error rmselog10 k and the coefficient of determination r2 are calculated the log scale value is applied for the hydraulic conductivity the rmselog10 k is defined as 14 rms e log 10 k 1 n k i 1 n k log 10 k i log 10 k i 2 r2 is defined as 15 r 2 1 i 1 n k log 10 k i log 10 k i 2 i 1 n k log 10 k i log 10 k 2 where log 10 k is the mean value of log 10 k i 4 results 4 1 the optimal values of ha for different soil types fig 2 shows the impact of different values of ha on the performance of the hcc estimation with the fxw m3 model a non zero ha does improve the estimation of hcc represented by a higher value of r2 and a lower value of rmselog10 k the improvement is more pronounced for sand sandy loam loam and silt loam soils when it comes to clay soils only slightly improvement is achieved the optimal value of ha varies for the different soil types of the validated 52 soil samples for sand and loam soils the rmselog10 k decreases and the r2 increases sharply for ha varying from 0 1 to about 50 cm and then changes smoothly for more negative matric potentials yielding an optimized value of ha close to the lower boundary of 150 cm the optimal value of ha is about 27 cm and 8 cm for sandy loam and silt loam soils respectively when it comes to clay soils ha has a much higher optimized value of about 4 cm however it should be kept in mind that the clay soil types have only three soil samples for all the 52 soil samples the optimal value of ha is about 16 cm 4 2 the overall performance in predicting the hcc the optimal value of ha for each soil type is applied in estimating the hcc the model performance for the evaluated 52 soil samples and for the five main soil types are summarized in table 2 among all models the mvgm model shows the poorest performance with the highest rmselog10 k value of 1 46 cm d 1 and the lowest r2 value of 0 69 when evaluating with the 52 soil samples the fxw m2 model substantially improves the prediction of hcc with a much lower rmselog10 k of 0 90 cm d 1 and a higher r2 of 0 86 when taking into account the effects of soil structure the fxw m3 model further improves the prediction of the hcc reducing the rmselog10 k from 0 90 cm d 1 the fxw m2 model to 0 78 cm d 1 and increasing the r2 slightly from 0 86 to 0 88 when treating k ha ha and l as free fitting parameters the fxw m3 opt model a reported rmselog10 k of only 0 23 cm d 1 remains and a much higher r2 of 0 99 was achieved for the five main soil types the mvgm model generally reports the highest values of rmselog10 k except for loam soils where the fxw m2 model has the highest value the fxw m3 model outperforms the mvgm and the fxw m2 models for all five soil types reporting the lowest values of rmselog10 k and the highest values of r2 when treating k ha ha and l as free fitting parameters the fxw m3 opt model achieves a substantial improvement for all soil types with reported rmselog10 k ranging from 0 20 cm d 1 loam and silt loam to 0 36 cm d 1 clay and reported r2 all higher than 0 96 4 3 predicting the hcc for individual soil samples 4 3 1 sand soils seven soil samples belong to sand soil for the swrc fig 3 shows that all models are in excellent agreement with observations for all the seven samples due to the difference in model structure the mvgm model approaches the residual water content while the fxw m2 and fxw m3 models show a decrease trend of water content in very dry conditions however no observation of water retention data is available in very dry range hindering the evaluation of the model performance the observed swrc generally does not exhibit an obviously bimodal shape for sand soils when it comes to hcc prediction the mvgm model underestimates the conductivity of all soils for matric potentials less than about 1000 cm except for soil 4001 which has no observations in this matric potential range fig 3 the mvgm model overestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for soil 4131 as a result the mvgm model reported the highest rmselog10 k value of 1 80 cm d 1 for sand soils table 2 compared to the mvgm model both the fxw m2 and the fxw m3 models improve the prediction of conductivity in dry conditions the fxw m2 model reported a much lower value of rmselog10 k of 0 96 cm d 1 and generally showed a close agreement with observations for soils 4000 4001 and 4650 however mainly for soils 4651 4660 and 4661 the fxw m2 model underestimates the conductivity for almost all the measured matric potential range as a result a much negative value of 149 cm was derived for the optimal ha for the fxw m3 model the fxw m3 model notably improves the prediction of hcc near saturation with the value of rmselog10 k reducing from 0 96 cm d 1 of the fxw m2 model to 0 79 cm d 1 however according to the criteria set for the importance role of soil structure i e the underestimation by the fxw m2 model and the overestimation by the mvgm model of near saturated hydraulic conductivity the effects of soil structure on the seven sandy soils were concluded as not significant when treating k ha ha and l as free fitting parameters a rmselog10 k of only 0 25 cm d 1 remains for the seven soil samples 4 3 2 sandy loam soils for the ten sandy loam soil samples all models are generally in close agreements with observations in fitting the swrc fig 4 and figure s1 the deviation happens for soils 2751 and 2753 fig 4 where the retention data shows an obvious bimodal shape the structure bimodality which may be due to the effects of a bimodal soil particle size distribution dexter et al 2008 occurs generally close to the matric potential of about 1000 cm however the measured hydraulic conductivity does not reach this matric potential range hindering the evaluation of the impact of bimodal swrc on the estimation of hcc the fxw m2 model underestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for all ten sandy loam soils with a reported rmselog10 k of 0 80 cm d 1 and r2 of 0 87 meanwhile the overestimation of the mvgm model in predicting the hcc is noticed for soils 2762 2764 4100 in fig 4 and 4162 4171 in figure s1 indicating clearly the effects of soil structure the reported rmselog10 k is 0 95 cm d 1 and r2 is 0 81 for the mvgm model compared to the fxw m2 model the fxw m3 model improves the prediction of conductivity for all ten sandy loam soils with reported rmselog10 k reduces from 0 80 of the fxw m2 model to 0 64 cm d 1 and r2 increases from 0 87 to 0 92 however for soils 2762 2764 4110 4162 and 4172 the fxw m3 model overestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation indicating a higher ha value than the optimized 27 cm for these five soil samples the model performance can be substantially improved when treating k ha ha and l as free fitting parameters with reported rmselog10 k of 0 21 cm d 1 and r2 of 0 99 remain table 2 4 3 3 loam soils for the 11 loam soils a slight deviation in fitting the swrc is noticed for soils 2601 2602 2611 2750 and 2752 where a bimodal swrc is shown in the mid water content range fig 5 the mvgm model is generally in close agreement with observations when predicting the hcc for seven out of 11 loam soil samples fig 5 for soils 2601 2602 4102 and 4111 the mvgm model overestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation the reported rmselog10 k is 0 88 cm d 1 and r2 is 0 89 the fxw m2 model underestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for almost all 11 loam soil samples reporting a higher rmselog10 k of 1 07 cm d 1 and a lower r2 of 0 86 than those reported by the mvgm model table 2 the critical matric potential for the fxw m2 model to underestimate the hydraulic conductivity ranged from about 10 cm for soils 2604 2752 4101 and 4102 to negative hundreds of cm for soils 2611 2741 2742 2750 as a result the optimal ha of the fxw m3 model is about 132 cm when evaluating with the 11 loam soils according to the criteria set for the importance of soil structure the effects of soil structure are concluded to be important for soils 2601 2602 4102 and 4111 compared to the fxw m2 model the fxw m3 model improves the prediction near saturation for all 11 loam soil samples fig 5 and figure s4 the rmselog10 k decreases from 1 07 cm d 1 of the fxw m2 model to 0 83 cm d 1 of the fxw m3 model and the r2 increases from 0 86 to 0 90 table 2 due to the much negative optimal value of ha the fxw m3 model slightly overestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for soils 2601 4102 and 4111 indicating the ha value is in fact different for different soils the rmselog10 k is only 0 20 cm d 1 and the r2 is 0 99 when treating k ha ha and l as free fitting parameters 4 3 4 silty loam soils all models are generally in close agreement with observations in fitting the swrc except for soils 2612 2613 2760 and 2761 where a bimodal swrc is noticed fig 6 the structure bimodality occurs in the mid water content range where no measurements of hydraulic conductivity are available when it comes to the hcc the mvgm model overestimates while the fxw m2 model underestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for almost all 14 silty loam soils indicating clearly the effects of soil structure the reported rmselog10 k is 1 37 cm d 1 and 0 68 cm d 1 and the r2 is 0 70 and 0 85 for the mvgm and the fxw m2 model respectively table 2 when accounting for the effects of soil structure the fxw m3 model improves the estimation of hcc near saturation in comparison with the fxw m2 model reducing the rmselog10 k from 0 68 cm d 1 of the fxw m2 model to 0 54 cm d 1 and increasing the r2 from 0 85 to 0 92 for the 14 silty loam soils the effects of soil structure are generally important for matric potentials higher than 10 cm treating k ha ha and l as free fitting parameters substantially reduces the rmselog10 k to 0 20 cm d 1 and increases the r2 to 0 98 4 3 5 clay soils the validated clay soils include only three soil samples all three soils show clearly the effects of soil structure indicated by the overestimation of the mvgm model and the underestimation of the fxw m2 model in estimating the near saturated hydraulic conductivity fig 7 the reported rmselog10 k is 2 06 cm d 1 and 0 89 cm d 1 and the r2 is 0 68 and 0 84 for the mvgm model and the fxw m2 model respectively table 2 when applying the fxw m3 model that accounts for the effects of soil structure the rmselog10 k reduces from 0 89 cm d 1 of the fxw m2 model to 0 68 cm d 1 and the r2 increases from 0 84 of the fxw m2 model to 0 94 for three clay soils evaluated the optimal ha has a much higher value of 4 cm than the values of other soil types the fxw m3 opt model that treating k ha ha and l as free fitted parameters reduces further the rmselog10 k to 0 36 cm d 1 and increases the r2 to 0 96 5 discussion 5 1 effects of soil structure on different soil types for the evaluated 52 soil samples the mvgm model developed by ippisch et al 2006 underestimates the hydraulic conductivity in the dry range for almost all seven sand soils while overestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for almost all 14 silt loam soils all three clay soils three out of ten sandy loam soils and three out of 11 loam soils the underestimation as discussed in detail in wang et al 2018 2022a b is because the mvgm model does not consider the effects of adsorption forces which are dominant in dry conditions the overestimation near saturation can be attributed to the application of the matching point ks that is sensitive to the presence of macropores while the mvgm model only accounts for the impact of soil texture van genuchten and nielsen 1985 the fxw m2 model underestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation for almost all 52 soil samples the main reason for the underestimation is that the fxw m2 model does not address the impact of soil structure wang et al 2022a besides the uncertainty in estimating the parameter b hm may also be the reason of the underestimation of hydraulic conductivity by the fxw m2 model wang et al 2022a when accounting for the effects of soil structure near saturation the proposed fxw m3 model outperforms the mvgm and the fxw m2 models for almost all 52 soil samples represented by a lower value of rmselog10 k however according to the criteria set only when the mvgm model overestimates while the fxw m2 model underestimates the hydraulic conductivity near saturation we can conclude that the effects of soil structure near saturation are important for a given soil as a result for the 52 evaluated soil samples the effects of soil structure near saturation are concluded to be important for almost all 14 silt loam soils all three clay soils three out of ten sandy loam soils and three out of 11 loam soils while for all the seven sandy soils seven sandy loam soils and eight loam soils the influence of soil structure near saturation is not significant for the soil samples where the effects of soil structure near saturation are not significant the outperformance of the fxw m3 model to the fxw m2 model can be attributed to the underestimated parameter b hm or k h a the possible underestimation of parameter k h a in the fxw m3 model and the small data size evaluated also explain why the optimal h a has a much negative value close to 150 cm for the evaluated seven sand soils and 11 loam soils for three out of seven sand soils fig 3 and four out of 11 loam soils fig 5 the fxw m3 model considerably underestimated the hydraulic conductivity in the relatively low matric potential range due to the small data size evaluated a much negative value of h a is thus required to give the lowest rmselog10 k according to the definition h a means the critical potential separating the influence of soil structure and soil texture therefore it is expected that h a has a much higher value for example scotter 1978 suggested the critical matric potential h a is about 15 cm to account for macropore børgesen et al 2006 suggested a value of 4 cm whereas jarvis 2007 suggested the value as 10 to 6 cm therefore the optimal h a value derived here for different soil type should not be interpreted strictly as an effect of soil structure when evaluating with all the 52 soil samples the optimal h a value is about 16 cm much close to the reported value in the literature in fact the fitting results of the fxw m3 opt model suggested although h a generally varies in a narrow range the value can be different for different soil sample besides the effects of soil structure near saturation the effects of soil structure in the mid water content range were found for two sandy loam soils three loam soils and five silt loam soils represented by a bimodal shape swrc figs 4 6 dexter et al 2008 also concluded that the bimodal swrc are normal in sandy loam and loamy sand soils while it is less common in pure sand soils this structural bimodality that occurs in the mid water content range could be attributed to the impacts of a bimodal particle size distribution dexter et al 2008 5 2 model limitations when the fxw m3 model is generally in good agreement with observations it underestimates the hydraulic conductivity for about seven out of 52 soil samples as discussed previously this underestimation is attributed to the uncertainty in estimation of b hm or k h a wang et al 2022a presented a detail discussion on the uncertainty in estimating b hm showing many factors such as the applied value of the hamaker constant the ionic concentration tokunaga 2011 and the possible impact of capillary forces in the dry range all have an impact on the estimation of b hm therefore if the saturated matrix hydraulic conductivity k h a is measured it is preferred to use the measured value directly as a matching point another limitation of the fxw m3 model is that it only accounts for the effects of soil structure near saturation for two sandy loam soils three loam soils and five silt loam soils the swrc shows a bimodal shape this structural bimodality that occurs in the mid water content range cannot be captured by the proposed fxw m3 model however it is hard to evaluate the impact of this bimodal swrc on the estimated hydraulic conductivity because the measured hydraulic conductivity generally does not reach this potential range to fully describe the influence of soil structure that occurs both near saturation due to the presence of macropore and far from saturation due to a bimodal particle size distribution the bimodal or multimodal swrc should also be applied in addition to modifying the hcc however as discussed in the introduction section the application of the bimodal or multimodal swrc introduces too many parameters and requires a detailed measurement of water retention data e g othmer et al 1991 ross smettem 1993 durner 1994 this complex bimodal soil hydraulic model may be useful in profile applications but is rarely applied in large scale applications fatichi et al 2020 5 3 data limitations in this study 52 soil samples from the unsoda database were applied for model evaluation however only 18 soil samples of them have more than three measured data pairs and one been still ks for matric potentials higher than 10 cm where soil structure is known to exert a strong influence on hydraulic conductivity jarvis 2007 meanwhile only five soil samples have measured value of θs the limited data size and the limited information close to saturation thus hinder an accurate assessment of the model performance for the ten soil samples that exhibited bimodal swrc the measured hcc generally covered only a relatively high range of matrix potentials as a result it is also difficult to assess the impact of bimodal swrc on hcc prediction 6 concluding remarks in this study we developed a novel model for the prediction of hcc by considering the effects of soil structure near saturation the introduced saturated matrix hydraulic conductivity in the termed fxw m3 model can either be measured using tension infiltrometers jorda et al 2015 or be estimated from the swrc in addition the new fxw m3 model takes into account both the capillary and adsorption forces providing a much better description of soil hydraulic properties in the low water content range compared to the commonly applied capillary based models wang et al 2016 therefore the fxw m3 model accounts for both the impact of soil structure near saturation and soil texture and is able to describe the soil hydraulic properties from saturation to oven dryness compared to the well known van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 model the fxw m3 model introduces no additional free parameters it is worth noting that in the fxw m3 model only the effects of soil structure on hcc are considered while the effects on swrc are considered to be of less concern testing with 52 soil samples suggested the fxw m3 model with k h a estimated from the swrc outperformed the fxw m2 model developed in wang et al 2022a and was generally in close agreement with observations therefore this new fxw m3 model provides an easy and practical way to incorporate the influence of soil structure near saturation in water and solute transport simulations however due to the uncertainty in estimating k h a from the swrc the fxw m3 model may underestimate the hydraulic conductivity for some soil samples indicating it is preferring to use the measured k h a as matching point when available in addition the fxw m3 model also cannot capture the structural bimodality that occurs in the mid water content range which is found in a few soil samples finally only 52 soil samples with limited measurements near saturation were applied for model evaluation therefore a large data size with high quality measurements of soil hydraulic properties are further needed to better assess the performance of the proposed model and the optimal value of ha declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

2138,afforestation is an efficient measure to mitigating climate change and achieving carbon neutrality however there is a growing concern regarding the impact of afforestation on water resource availability owing to the water consumption through evapotranspiration et the loess plateau lp in china has implemented the largest afforestation program in the world the grain for green program gfgp to curtail severe soil erosion however the effects of large scale afforestation on the atmospheric branch of the hydrological cycle i e the atmospheric water cycle awc are poorly understood combining a regional climate model and an analytical precipitation recycling model this study quantitatively investigated the responses of precipitation recycling and components of the atmospheric water cycle to the gfgp over the lp during the rainy season two long term simulations with high resolution were conducted for the lp s regional climate under two scenarios with and without the implementation of the gfgp results show that the gfgp intensified the awc and increased the precipitation and atmospheric water vapor the gfgp enhanced the et and precipitation recycling ratio of the internal branch of the awc which contributed 15 51 of the increased precipitation meanwhile the contribution of the external branch was 84 49 in addition both the inflow and outflow moisture fluxes showed increases induced by the gfgp the inflow was larger than the outflow leading to more moisture being retained on the lp moreover the enhanced et reinforced surface diabatic heating and caused an abnormal cyclone resulting in more moisture being advected from the southern boundary which can partly counteract the weakening east asian summer monsoon furthermore the gfgp has remotely strengthened the water vapor advection being received by downwind areas this work advances the current understanding of the way large scale afforestation affects the hydrological cycle from the viewpoint of the awc and can help direct future afforestation plans towards science informed carbon neutrality and sustainable ecosystem management keywords afforestation precipitation recycling atmospheric water cycle wrf model loess plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction afforestation has been considered an adequate strategy to mitigate climate change given its positive role in carbon neutrality branch and wulfmeyer 2019 swann et al 2012 it is also an efficient way to protect the ecosystem and curb soil erosion feng et al 2016 however afforestation can enhance or reduce regional water availability by altering evapotranspiration et streamflow precipitation and soil moisture hoek van dijke et al 2022 when to assess the influence of afforestation numerous studies have concentrated on the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle qiu et al 2021 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 but have paid little attention to its atmospheric branch that is the atmospheric water cycle awc e g atmospheric water and precipitation recycling moreover atmospheric water is an important water resource mainly influenced by the processes of moisture flux advection and moisture recycling these processes of the awc can be modified by afforestation through land atmosphere interaction meier et al 2021 yosef et al 2018 however the ways in which the awc responds to afforestation are still poorly understood there is an urgent need to advance our knowledge of such responses facilitating the formulation of sustainable global afforestation policies especially in water limited regions atmospheric water over a region originates from two sources advected external water vapor and evaporated internal water vapor eltahir and bras 1996 the former refers to water vapor flowing into a region through external advection and the latter refers to water vapor from local et the process of converting evaporated internal water vapor into precipitation is called precipitation recycling dominguez et al 2006 previous studies have shown afforestation can lead to changes in these two sources of atmospheric water kemena et al 2018 suggested that afforestation of the sahara enhanced the obtainment of moisture advection mid latitude afforestation has been shown to lead to a shift in atmospheric circulation swann et al 2012 which affected moisture transport at a continental scale in addition syktus and mcalpine 2016 concluded that the restoration of woodlands in australia led to increased precipitation via the enhancement of et however as pointed out by wierik et al 2021 regional studies that aim to explore the effects of afforestation on regional climate remain scarce the chinese loess plateau lp comprises the largest loess area about 640 000 km2 in the world and contributes approximately 90 of the sediment that enters the yellow river wang et al 2016 to control severe soil erosion of the lp the chinese government launched a large scale afforestation program the grain for green program gfgp in the late 1990 s with an accumulated investment of us 54 570 million bryan et al 2018 the gfgp is well known as the largest afforestation program on earth cao et al 2019 as a result the ecological environment has been greatly improved the vegetation cover of the lp has dramatically increased by approximately 25 feng et al 2016 and the sediment content of the yellow river has markedly declined by approximately 80 zhao et al 2014 meanwhile the et of the lp has substantially increased at a rate of 4 30 mm yr 1 feng et al 2016 therefore the lp can serve as an ideal platform for exploring the hydroclimatic response to afforestation furthermore it is estimated that our planet still has an extra tree restoration potential of 9 million km2 under current climate conditions bastin et al 2019 given the recent announcement by the united nations of the decade on ecosystem restoration hoek van dijke et al 2022 a detailed investigation of the hydroclimatic effect of the gfgp will provide valuable insights for similar regions intensive land cover change induced by the gfgp has profoundly affected the hydrological cycle and the availability of water resources over the lp feng et al 2016 luan et al 2022 qiu et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 feng et al 2016 used a creative conceptual model which suggested that the gfgp has resulted in sustainable water resources of the lp reaching their limit but this did not consider the impact of the gfgp on precipitation using a coupled land atmosphere global climate model y li et al 2018 pointed out that the increased precipitation induced by the improved vegetation cover can partly offset the enhanced et resulting from the gfgp and such an impact on precipitation has usually been overlooked using the weather research and forecasting model wrf zhang et al 2021 also found that the gfgp has exerted a positive impact on regional precipitation over the lp however the impact of the gfgp on the awc has not been investigated in detail it remains unclear how the external e g moisture inflow and outflow and internal e g precipitation recycling components of the awc respond to the gfgp quantification of the relative contributions of advected external and evaporated internal moisture to regional precipitation i e precipitation recycling is central to the analysis of the response of the awc to the gfgp analytical models based on the conservation of atmospheric water vapor are efficient tools and are widely used to quantify precipitation recycling dominguez et al 2006 insua costa and miguez macho 2018 owing to the simplicity of calculation and economy of computational resources additionally reanalysis datasets are often used to drive the analytical models dominguez et al 2018 gimeno et al 2012 but their relatively coarse spatial resolution limits their application in regions with complex terrain a further limitation is that reanalysis datasets cannot be used to separate the effects of climate change and land cover change because they merely offer a numerical representation of the historical climate reichle et al 2017 tariku and gan 2018 in contrast with high spatial resolutions regional climate models rcms are able to realize various simulations with different artificially controlled boundary conditions and then isolate the net effect of land cover change cao et al 2019 halder et al 2016 huang et al 2020 consequently using output from rcms to drive analytical models is an appropriate option to quantitatively diagnose precipitation recycling over a region this study aims to quantify the effect of large scale afforestation i e the gfgp on the awc of the lp the precipitation recycling analysis is performed using the wrf model in conjunction with an analytical model first we conducted two long term wrf simulations under scenarios with and without the occurrence of the gfgp next changes in precipitation and atmospheric water induced by the gfgp were analyzed responses of the internal and external branches of the awc to the gfgp were then investigated in detail finally we systematically diagnosed the physical mechanism to interpret the influence of the gfgp this study attempts to address the following questions 1 how do precipitation and atmospheric water respond to the gfgp 2 to what extent does the gfgp affect precipitation recycling 3 how does the gfgp modify regional moisture transport 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lp is situated in the upper and middle reaches fig 1 a of the yellow river basin in north central china 33 41 41 51 n 99 113 40 e with a population of 97 81 million li et al 2021 the lp is a crucial region for the nation it plays an important role in the eco security shield for reducing sediment and the risk of flooding in downstream regions the plateau has a complex topography with an elevation that varies from 91 to 4 812 m the plateau is located in the transitional zone between semi arid and semi humid regions wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 and the annual mean 2 m air temperature ranges from 4 to 14 1982 2015 the annual mean et varies from 150 to 600 mm yr 1 the annual mean precipitation varies from 200 to 800 mm yr 1 1982 2015 and 68 71 of this precipitation is concentrated during the rainy season from june to september tang et al 2018 which is controlled by the east asian summer monsoon zhang et al 2011 the lp has suffered severe soil erosion owing to the high erodibility of loess and serious farming activities feng et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 with the aim of protecting the regional ecosystem the gfgp was launched to convert cropland to grassland and forest across the lp hence the gfgp led to an extreme change in land cover lc fig 1b shows that there were 54 types of lc conversion between 1999 and 2015 with the top five conversion types contributing 83 57 of the changed area across the lp the converted areas from cropland to grassland and from barren land to grassland were 33 664 and 13 563 km2 respectively this accounts for approximately 60 of the top five conversion types detailed spatial information is provided in fig s1 consequently the fraction of vegetation cover fvc in the rainy season substantially increased over most areas 91 45 of the lp fig 1c with an increase of 4 13 decade 1 after the initiation of the gfgp compared with 1 18 decade 1 before the gfgp fig s2 a meanwhile 70 69 of the lp area experienced an upward trend of precipitation in the rainy season fig 1d with an increase of 18 49 mm decade 1 after the initiation of the gfgp compared with a decreasing trend 2 99 mm decade 1 before the gfgp fig s2b given the greening and wetting trends after the initiation of the gfgp this work aims to unravel the impact of the gfgp on the awc during the rainy season 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 forcing datasets in this study we adopted the european centre for medium range weather forecasts interim reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 to drive the wrf model the era interim supplied initial and boundary atmospheric conditions for our wrf simulations it has been widely employed to force previous regional climate modeling and shows excellent performance over the lp cao et al 2019 ge et al 2020 the era interim has a horizontal resolution of 0 75 and 60 vertical levels up to 0 1 hpa this reanalysis dataset supplies variables on the land surface and pressure levels at an interval of 6 h in addition lc forcing data in this study was acquired from the climate change initiative program of the european space agency esa cci lc plummer et al 2017 the esa cci lc dataset provides annual global lc maps with a spatial resolution of 300 m covering the period 1992 to 2015 it presents a consistent time series by absorbing multiple observational products with high accuracy and has wide application in climate modeling w li et al 2018 liu et al 2021 moreover we obtained land forcing data from the global land surface satellite glass datasets liang et al 2013 which offer important parameters associated with land surface processes related to vegetation in the wrf including monthly albedo leaf area index lai and fvc the above land forcing data was used to set up different scenarios within wrf simulations details of the experimental settings are presented in section 2 3 2 2 2 evaluation datasets simulated precipitation was validated based on a gridded dataset the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd the cmfd assimilates in situ observations reanalysis data and remote sensing products he et al 2020 and has a spatial resolution of 0 1 covering the period 1979 2018 at a monthly scale owing to its high spatial resolution and accuracy the cmfd has been widely used in model validation in china shao et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 in addition the simulated land surface temperature lst was assessed using a global monthly land surface temperature dataset developed by chen et al 2017 which was produced using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis datasets the spatial resolution of this lst dataset is 0 05 0 05 and it covers the period 2000 2020 moreover we adopted an ensemble et dataset to evaluate our et simulations in order to decrease the uncertainties in et products three products were used to derive the ensemble et dataset these were the modified priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl dataset shao et al 2019 global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 3a gleamv3 3a dataset martens et al 2017 and penman monteith leuning model version 1 pml v1 dataset zhang et al 2016 the three et datasets were interpolated to 0 1 using the bilinear interpolation method and then the ensemble et product was calculated as the average of the three interpolated et datasets during their shared period detailed information regarding the datasets used in this work can be found in table s1 2 3 wrf model and experiment design 2 3 1 wrf model the wrf version 3 6 model was employed in this study this mesoscale forecast model is a fully compressible and non hydrostatic model that uses the terrain following coordinate and has a variety of physical schemes skamarock et al 2008 the wrf has been broadly applied to study regional climate change at high spatial resolution zhang et al 2022 in this study the wrf was configured with a single domain covering the whole lp fig 1a the domain had a horizontal resolution of 10 km and consisted of 160 160 grids with a projection of lambert conformal conic the center of the domain was at 37 n 108 e with a boundary covering less mountainous regions as far as possible to reduce the effect of complex topography on the simulation the model had 30 layers up to 50 hpa in the vertical direction we used an optimal combination of wrf schemes for the lp as suggested by tian et al 2022a such an optimal combination was derived through comprehensive sensitivity tests and has been shown to greatly improve regional climate modeling of the lp interested readers can refer to tian et al 2022a for details of this combination table s2 lists the physical schemes used in this study 2 3 2 experiment design to isolate the net effect of the gfgp on the awc we conducted two numerical experiments using the same optimal physical schemes the simulations ran from september 1999 to december 2015 and the spin up periods were set as four months from the previous year september to december to minimize the uncertainties introduced by initial conditions the land surface driving data were the only differences between the two simulations the control experiment wrf ctl used the wrf default land forcing data to represent a hypothetical scenario in which the gfgp did not occur in contrast the dynamic vegetation experiment wrf dyn updated the default land forcing data with annual lc datasets from the esa cci lc and monthly glass datasets during the period 2000 2015 to reflect the actual land cover condition induced by the gfgp because the lc classification system in esa cci lc adopted the standard of the food and agriculture organization we reclassed the lc data into the united states geological survey classification system which is recognized by the wrf and then re gridded the reclassed lc data to the curvilinear grid of the wrf the essential parameters i e albedo lai and fvc obtained from the glass datasets were bilinearly interpolated to 0 1 and then re gridded to the wrf curvilinear grid we only replaced the annual lc and monthly parameters data within the lp thus the difference between wrf ctl and wrf dyn can be used to quantify the net influence of the gfgp 2 4 analysis methods 2 4 1 dynamic precipitation recycling model the dynamic precipitation recycling model dprm is an analytical model dominguez et al 2006 that is mainly applied to derive the precipitation recycling ratio prr this model has a simple calculation process and can explore the spatial distribution of the prr wang et al 2021 unlike traditional analytical models it can be used at multiple time scales daily monthly and longer given its consideration of the change in the atmospheric water vapor dominguez et al 2020 details of the dprm can be found in dominguez et al 2006 here we briefly introduce the dprm as follows the change in water vapor in the entire atmospheric column can be described as the conservation equation of atmospheric water vapor eq 1 which is applicable for both grid and regional scales 1 p w v t p w v u x p w v v y e t p r e c where pwv indicates the precipitable water vapor p w v t indicates the temporal variation in pwv u v is the vertically integrated moisture weighted zonal meridional wind speed p w v u x p w v v y represents the vertically integrated moisture flux divergence and et and prec denote the evapotranspiration and precipitation respectively furthermore the total water vapor can be divided into the internal recycled component and external advected component and we can obtain eq 2 by separating the recycled component from eq 1 2 pwv r t pwv r u x pwv r v y e t r p where pwvr is the recycled evaporated component of pwv pwv r t is the temporal variation in pwvr pwv r u x pwv r v y represents the vertically integrated moisture flux divergence originating from et and rp represents the recycled precipitation additionally given the assumption that the two sources of water vapor are well mixed the ratio ρ prr in a grid of recycled precipitation rp to total precipitation prec is equal to the ratio of recycled water vapor pwvr to total water vapor pwv that is 3 prec r p prec a p w v pwv r pwv a ρ rp prec pwv r pwv therefore by applying eqs 1 and 3 to eq 2 we can derive the formula of the prr in a grid ρ 4 ρ 1 e x p 0 t et pwv d t finally the prr of the entire region can be calculated using the ρ and precipitation of all grids within the region 5 prr region i 1 n ρ i prec i δ a i i 1 n prec i δ a i where prrregion denotes the prr of the whole region and ρi preci and δai denote the prr precipitation and area of the grid i within the region respectively 2 4 2 metrics for evaluation and statistical analysis the pattern correlation coefficient pcc root mean square error rmse and mean bias error bias were applied to evaluate the spatiotemporal performance of the wrf simulations the formulas of these metrics are as follows argüeso et al 2012 wang et al 2020 6 pcc i 1 n x obs i x obs x wrf i x wrf i 1 n x obs i x obs 2 i 1 n x wrf i x wrf 2 7 rmse i 1 n x wrf i x obs i 2 n 8 bias i 1 n x wrf i x obs i n where i denotes the grid i in the spatial evaluation and the time i in the temporal validation n denotes the total number of grids within the study region or years during the verified period x obs i is the observation ranking of i x obs is the average of n observations x wrf i is the re gridded simulation ranking of i and x wrf is the average of the n re gridded simulations the trend analysis used in this study was linear regression based on the ordinary least squares method this method calculates the slope of the time series to depict the overall trend of the climate variables before and after the gfgp the student s t test was further applied to evaluate the significance of the linear fitting trend meanwhile the student s t test was utilized to determine whether the impact of the gfgp on the awc was significant or not the difference was considered a significant change if it passed the test at a significance level of 95 2 4 3 potential vorticity diagnosis potential vorticity pv diagnosis has been widely employed to diagnose the dynamic and thermodynamic conditions of the atmosphere xie et al 2018 we investigated the effect of surface diabatic heating on moisture convergence based on the pv budget equation zhang et al 2019 the pv at the grid scale can be calculated in the p vertical coordinate as shown in eq 9 9 p v t u p v x v p v y w p v p g v p q x u p q y f ξ p q p where u v and w represent zonal wind speed meridional wind speed and vertical velocity respectively g denotes gravitational acceleration q denotes diabatic heating rate f denotes coriolis parameter and ξ p v x u y denotes the vertical component of relative vorticity the regional pv budget can be expressed in the form of an area integral as shown in eq 10 and the change in regional pv qtnd can be decomposed into three different contributions the net cross boundary pv fluxes qbnd the condensing or diluting rates of area integrated pv owing to 3d velocity divergence qcon and the pv production rates induced by diabatic heating qdbh 10 s p v t d s s v 3 p v d s s p v v 3 d s s g ξ a q d s where s p v t d s is qtnd s v 3 p v d s is qbnd s p v v 3 d s is qcon and s g ξ a q d s is qdbh the qbnd2d qcon2d and qdbh2d stand for the horizontal component of each corresponding term respectively 3 results 3 1 evaluation of wrf simulations the capability of the wrf model to reproduce the regional climate is an essential prerequisite to quantifying the effects of large scale afforestation this study first evaluated the accuracy of wrf simulations in capturing precipitation prec lst and et fig 2 over the lp which are fundamental variables of hydrological and energy processes the spatiotemporal assessment of prec is shown in the first column of fig 2 it is clear that both wrf ctl fig 2d and wrf dyn fig 2g successfully captured the observed spatial pattern fig 2a of prec specifically the pcc and rmse of wrf ctl wrf dyn were 0 86 0 88 and 60 80 mm yr 1 48 02 mm yr 1 respectively in addition the biases of wrf ctl and wrf dyn were compared at a grid scale fig 2j the mean bias of wrf ctl was 37 50 mm yr 1 the magnitude of which was considerably larger than that of wrf dyn 1 83 mm yr 1 moreover fig 2m shows a comparison of the temporal variation in annual area averaged prec where the time series of wrf dyn is closer to that of the observations than is wrf ctl thus wrf dyn incorporating the real lc change over the lp has a higher degree of agreement with prec observations than does wrf ctl we further evaluated the performance of the wrf in simulating lst over the lp by comparing the spatial distributions of climatological lst from observations wrf ctl and wrf dyn fig 2b e h the pccs of both wrf ctl and wrf dyn were 0 95 and the rmses were 1 60 and 1 41 respectively additionally the lst comparison between the two wrf simulations at a grid scale is displayed in fig 2k the ratio of the bias of wrf dyn to that of wrf ctl was 0 83 indicating that wrf dyn had a smaller bias than did wrf ctl fig 2n shows the temporal variations in wrf ctl and wrf dyn the r2 and rmse of wrf ctl wrf dyn were 0 63 0 72 and 0 60 0 47 respectively hence both wrf lst simulations were able to approximate the observations but wrf dyn performed better similarly the right hand column of fig 2 examines the ability of the wrf to mirror the observed et as shown in fig 2f and i a spatial comparison of climatological et showed that the pccs and rmses of wrf ctl wrf dyn were 0 82 0 84 and 45 64 mm yr 1 41 97 mm yr 1 respectively at a grid scale fig 2l the mean bias of wrf ctl wrf dyn was 23 26 mm yr 1 1 25 mm yr 1 for the temporal variation in annual area averaged et fig 2o the rmse of wrf dyn 9 01 mm yr 1 was substantially less than that of wrf ctl 22 57 mm yr 1 which indicates that wrf dyn was closer to the et observations in summary the above evaluation illustrates that the wrf simulation with real land cover forcing i e wrf dyn can adequately represent variables relevant to the hydrological and energy processes while the non afforestation scenario i e wrf ctl produced results that deviated markedly from the observations such an outperformance of wrf dyn over wrf ctl provides considerable confidence for our subsequent numerical experiments to quantify the influence of the gfgp furthermore the difference between the wrf dyn and wrf ctl can be used to isolate the net impact of large scale afforestation on the awc over the lp see sections 3 2 3 4 3 2 impact of large scale afforestation on water vapor transport 3 2 1 precipitation and precipitable water vapor the effect of the gfgp on the awc is directly reflected in the change in prec fig 3 a shows the temporal variability in annual prec difference δprec wrf dyn minus wrf ctl after the introduction of the gfgp all years exhibited a positive δprec with a mean value of 32 44 mm yr 1 these values were statistically significant at the 95 confidence level fig 3b demonstrates that prec increased in most areas 99 95 of the lp after the introduction of the gfgp these results suggest that the gfgp exerted a positive impact on regional prec over the lp the increased prec also indicates that the awc underwent considerable changes under the scenario of large scale afforestation we investigated changes in the precipitable water vapor pwv over the lp because pwv in the atmosphere supplies moisture during the formation of precipitation as shown in fig 3c positive pwv differences δpwv dominated all years after the introduction of the gfgp with a mean δpwv of 0 64 mm 90 confidence level fig 3d shows the spatial pattern of climatological δpwv where the entire lp is dominated by positive δpwv with a maximum δpwv of 1 19 mm spatiotemporal analysis of δpwv revealed that the gfgp caused the increase in pwv over the lp the increased pwv results from changes in the external and internal branches of moisture transport in the awc the following section will scrutinize the responses of moisture transport to the gfgp and explore the physical reasons for these responses 3 2 2 evaporated internal water vapor local water vapor evaporated through et is an important contributor to atmospheric water vapor over the lp to quantify the response of evaporated internal water vapor to the gfgp we investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of et changes δet et difference between wrf dyn and wrf ctl as depicted in fig 4 a positive δet was presented in all years after the introduction of the gfgp with a mean δet of 26 38 mm yr 1 99 confidence level additionally positive δet covered 86 85 of the lp fig 4b and δet was statistically significant in a large proportion of areas 62 19 hence this spatiotemporal analysis demonstrates that the amount of evaporated internal water vapor has increased significantly under the influence of the gfgp furthermore the relationship between the fraction of vegetation cover fvc and et was analyzed there has been a rapid upward trend in fvc 4 13 decade 1 fig s2a and the changes in fvc fig 1c and et fig 4b show similar spatial patterns characterized by a widespread increase over the lp and higher values clustering around the southeastern lp the correlation coefficient between the rainy season δet and δfvc was 0 64 99 confidence level therefore we can conclude that the significant greening trend induced by the gfgp led to the increased et which is in accordance with previous studies feng et al 2016 luan et al 2022 3 2 3 advected external water vapor advected moisture from outside the study area is another source of atmospheric water vapor over the lp we quantified changes in the inflow and outflow of moisture flux after the introduction of the gfgp fig 5 to this end the boundary of the lp was divided into 14 edges fig 5a including 8 inflow edges blue and 6 outflow edges red according to the climatological state of the vertically integrated moisture flux vimf over the lp in details we calculated the mean annual vimf during the rainy season and then obtained these edges through keeping less difference between directions of the vimf above the same edge as possible fig 5a shows the spatial pattern of vimf difference δvimf between wrf dyn and wrf ctl a comparison of the climatological vimf between wrf ctl and wrf dyn is shown in fig s3 a positive δvimf with a mean value of 0 93 kg m 1 s 1 is shown to dominate most areas 75 67 of the lp revealing a strengthening transport of moisture flux caused by the gfgp a detailed analysis was conducted with respect to moisture flux changes at each edge as depicted in fig 5b the moisture flux of five inflow edges 3 4 11 12 and 13 increased while that of three inflow edges 1 2 and 9 decreased edges 3 and 4 at the southern boundary dominated the changes in the inflow edges meanwhile the moisture flux of four outflow edges 6 7 8 and 10 increased while that of two outflow edges 5 and 14 decreased edges 6 7 and 8 at the eastern boundary dominated the changes in the outflow edges in total fig 5c both the climatological inflow and outflow of moisture flux increased after the introduction of the gfgp with increases of 15 67 105 and 11 99 105 kg s 1 respectively however the increase in inflow was larger than that of outflow and thus the net moisture flow flux exhibited an increase of 3 68 105 kg s 1 indicating that implementation of the gfgp resulted in more water vapor being retained within the lp in summary the impact of gfgp strengthened not only the internal but also the external branches of moisture transport 3 3 impact of large scale afforestation on the atmospheric water cycle 3 3 1 precipitation recycling following the analysis of atmospheric water transport the effect of the gfgp on the conversion from evaporated water vapor to prec was further probed using the precipitation recycling ratio prr fig 6 a shows the spatial pattern of the prr difference δprr between wrf dyn and wrf ctl where positive δprr occupies 84 10 of the entire lp area over 40 of the lp area showed a significant 95 confidence level increase in prr and this was mainly distributed in the central and eastern parts of the plateau additionally the inset of fig 6a demonstrates that the difference between the prr of wrf dyn and wrf ctl was significant 99 confidence level at a grid scale while the mean prr of wrf ctl and wrf dyn was 8 18 and 8 91 respectively moreover as the time series of annual δprr shows fig s4a positive δprr was displayed in all years after the implementation of the gfgp with a mean δprr of 0 73 statistically significant at 99 confidence level these results imply that the gfgp enhanced the efficiency of conversion from evaporated water vapor to prec we subsequently assessed the contributions of the internal and external branches of the awc to δprec over the lp fig 6b displays the spatial pattern of the difference in recycled precipitation rp that originates from evaporated internal water vapor most areas 95 89 of the lp exhibited a positive difference in rp δrp and rp increased significantly 95 confidence level in 35 88 of lp areas after the implementation of the gfgp additionally the inset of fig 6b compares the rp of the two wrf simulations at a grid scale the rp was significantly different between wrf ctl and wrf dyn the mean rp of wrf ctl and wrf dyn were 23 27 and 28 30 mm yr 1 respectively furthermore the time series of δrp shown in fig s4b shows a significant positive rp difference after the introduction of the gfgp 99 confidence level with a mean δrp of 5 03 mm yr 1 thus rp increased significantly in response to the implementation of the gfgp fig 6c inspects the change in prec originating from advected external water vapor preca with positive δpreca widely distributed 99 93 over the lp the inset shows the preca difference 90 confidence level between wrf ctl and wrf dyn at a grid scale with mean preca of 241 89 and 269 30 mm yr 1 respectively in addition the temporal variation in δpreca exhibited large positive differences in all years after the implementation of the gfgp with a mean δpreca of 27 41 mm yr 1 fig s4b consequently preca increased substantially in response to the gfgp in general both rp and preca have been elevated by the impact of the gfgp but preca has changed more markedly 27 41 mm yr 1 relative to rp 5 03 mm yr 1 that is the contributions of changes in the internal and external branches of the awc to the increased prec induced by the gfgp were 15 51 and 84 49 respectively such an dominant contribution 84 49 indicates that the increase in prec has mainly been caused by the intensified external branch of the awc 3 3 2 atmospheric water budget to clarify the impact of the gfgp on the awc over the lp we used a schematic diagram to describe changes in the different components of the awc fig 7 it should be noted that all values i e differences between wrf dyn and wrf ctl were divided by the climatological value of δprec and then multiplied by 100 for ease of reading guo et al 2018 additionally fig s5 shows the climatological atmospheric water budget of wrf ctl and wrf dyn for the internal branch of the awc all components have significantly changed 99 confidence level in detail et has increased by 81 31 a relative change of 14 27 the portion of et that is converted into regional precipitation rp has increased by 15 51 21 66 and the remainder of the et that flows out of the region fout r has increased by 65 80 13 21 for the external branch of the awc the advected external water vapor that flows into the region fin has increased by 79 59 2 24 the portion of fin that is converted into regional precipitation preca has increased by 84 49 11 33 and the remainder of fin that flows out of the region fout a has decreased by 4 90 0 17 furthermore the water vapor that flows out of the region fout the sum of fout a and fout r has increased by 60 90 1 84 mainly attributed to an increase in fout r indicating that enhanced et sustains moisture outflow from the lp to downwind regions 3 4 atmospheric diagnosis of responses in the atmospheric water cycle 3 4 1 thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere we further performed a detailed atmospheric diagnosis to explore the physical mechanism of the intensified awc induced by the gfgp fig 8 a demonstrates the difference δq in specific humidity q between wrf dyn and wrf ctl which represents the change in the moisture condition near the surface 800 hpa pressure level after the implementation of the gfgp the q increased over almost the entire lp 97 85 and the mean δq was 0 27 g kg 1 indicating a more humid atmosphere under the wrf dyn scenario in addition fig 8b shows the change in the horizontal wind at the 800 hpa pressure level there was an obvious cyclonic circulation over the lp after the implementation of the gfgp indicating an enhanced moisture convergence this abnormal cyclone also resulted in a stronger southwesterly wind at the southern boundary of the lp which is in accordance with the strengthened inflow of moisture flux fig 5b in fig 8c we show the changes δcape in convective available potential energy cape a measure of the convective instability of the entire atmosphere after the implementation of the gfgp positive δcape covered a high proportion 95 97 of the entire lp with a mean δcape of 28 34 j kg 1 and the cape increased significantly over 44 34 of the lp 95 confidence level moreover the inset of fig 8c also shows a remarkable difference in the cape between wrf ctl and wrf dyn at a regional scale after the introduction of the gfgp with mean capes of 183 72 and 212 06 j kg 1 respectively the reinforced cape illustrates that more energy was available for the development of convection furthermore as per the profiles shown in fig 8d compared with wrf ctl vertical velocity in wrf dyn showed increases at all pressure levels from 850 to 300 hpa indicating the intensification of uplift movement in the atmosphere after the implementation of the gfgp in summary after the implementation of the gfgp an abnormal cyclone led to moisture advection from the southern boundary and a change in the thermodynamic properties of the atmospheric condition was more conducive to precipitation formation 3 4 2 surface energy fluxes and diabatic heating fluxes associated with the surface energy budget were further analyzed because the atmospheric state is tightly related to energy exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere fig 9 a depicts the spatial pattern of sensible heat flux sh difference δsh between wrf ctl and wrf dyn positive δsh occupies 57 10 of the lp with a mean δsh of 1 70 w m 2 in addition the inset shows the slight increase in sh in wrf dyn 51 36 w m 2 compared with wrf ctl 49 66 w m 2 however latent heat flux lh shows a more obvious increase than that of sh as shown in fig 9b positive δlh dominates 86 83 of the area of the lp with a mean δlh of 6 18 w m 2 the lh increased significantly over 62 21 of the lp 95 confidence level in addition the inset of fig 9b also shows a significant difference between wrf ctl and wrf dyn 99 confidence level with mean lhs of 42 92 and 49 10 w m 2 respectively therefore both sh and lh increased after the gfgp implying an increase in surface diabatic heating that was dominated by enhanced lh the potential vorticity pv was next diagnosed to clarify the impact of surface diabatic heating fig 9c shows the vertical profile of differences δqtnd in the time rates of area integrated pv changes qtnd from 800 to 300 hpa δqtnd is distinctly larger than zero in the lower atmosphere from 800 to 750 hpa the occurrence of positive δqtnd indicates the regional potential vorticity of near surface atmosphere increased after the implementation of the gfgp in addition we analyzed the vertical profiles of differences in the components of the pv budget fig 9d with the profiles of each component in the pv budgets of wrf ctl and wrf dyn shown in fig s6 as fig 9d shows the three components in the qtnd budget are qbnd3d qcon3d and qdbh3d the change in qdbh3d δqdbh3d was evidently larger than those in the other two components and thus δqdbh3d dominated the positive δqtnd fig 9c additionally the change in the vertical component of qdbh3d provided the larger contribution 69 94 to the δqdbh3d this indicates that intensified surface diabatic heating was the main driver of the pv increase hence enhanced lh was the main contributor to the reinforced surface diabatic heating subsequently causing the stronger cyclonic vorticity fig 8b in the lower atmosphere 4 discussion to alleviate severe soil erosion china has carried out a large scale afforestation program the gfgp over the lp in the context of rising concerns about water security over this water limited region branch and wulfmeyer 2019 luan et al 2022 we quantified the net impact of the gfgp on the atmospheric branch of the hydrological cycle using high resolution wrf simulations as far as we are aware this is the first study to quantify the response of the awc to the gfgp in terms of precipitation recycling and atmospheric moisture budget we found that the gfgp intensified the awc and increased the regional prec and atmospheric moisture our findings are well supported by previous studies which pointed out that the gfgp had a positive impact on regional prec by considering land atmosphere interactions cao et al 2019 y li et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 however these studies did not further investigate the response of the awc conversely studies exist feng et al 2016 qiu et al 2021 yu et al 2021 which suggest that excessive afforestation is responsible for a decline in streamflow and soil moisture over the lp these studies mainly used offline land surface hydrological and physical based conceptual models which overlooked the potential feedback of prec ge et al 2020 in fact the indirect precipitation recycling effects of large scale afforestation can counterbalance direct et effects hoek van dijke et al 2022 therefore this study advances our understanding of the climatic impact of the gfgp from the perspective of the awc water evaporated by local et can partly be recycled as local prec dominguez et al 2006 using high resolution wrf output to drive a precipitation recycling model we assessed the net impact of the gfgp on precipitation recycling over the lp we found that the gfgp enhanced the prr by 0 73 indicating that the efficiency of conversion of et to prec was elevated after the implementation of the gfgp wang et al 2021 and tian et al 2022b reported that the prr increased after the introduction of the gfgp but they did not isolate the contribution of the gfgp given regional climate change is also an important factor affecting the prr an et al 2017 this was mainly because wang et al 2021 used a reanalysis dataset which comprised mixed climate change and afforestation information to drive their dprm in addition we here report that increased et contributed approximately 16 of the increased prec which underscores the impact of land use change on prec in temperate regions wierik et al 2021 this study also suggests a strong relationship between afforestation and increased et the gfgp has previously been reported to be the main driver of increasing et luan et al 2022 enhanced et is attributed to sufficient soil moisture supply enhanced infiltration and water retention capacity deep roots and high conductance induced by high vegetation cover farley et al 2005 the atmospheric moisture budget is an essential aspect of the awc dennis and berbery 2022 this study specifically explored how the inflow and outflow of moisture fluxes responded to the gfgp over the lp we found that the gfgp led to more moisture being retained on the lp mainly attributed to increased inflow at the southern boundary through this boundary the east asian summer monsoon easm transports water vapor to the lp during the rainy season yang et al 2019 it has been reported that the easm has experienced significant weakening that has decreased moisture transport to the lp ding et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 which was mainly caused by the ocean variability and human aerosol forcing li et al 2010 zhou et al 2020 interestingly our study suggests that enhanced et led to an abnormal cyclone caused by a strengthening of diabatic heating further strengthening moisture transport across the southern boundary this finding confirms that afforestation can indirectly change atmospheric circulation by altering the exchanges of moisture momentum and energy between the land surface and atmosphere wierik et al 2021 previous studies have also shown that land cover change can affect atmospheric circulation and cause prec redistribution ruiz vásquez et al 2020 silva et al 2016 the present study highlights the positive impact of the gfgp on moisture transport which partly offsets the negative impact of the easm weakness we found that the enhanced et induced by the gfgp not only provides moisture for regional precipitation recycling but also transports considerable amounts of water vapor to downwind areas e g the north china plain the north china plain ncp is a fundamental breadbasket for china as shown in fig 10 although the area averaged precipitation of the ncp slightly decreased with a rate of 3 74 mm decade 1 most grids in the northern ncp of which moisture outflows from the east boundary of the loess plateau show an upward trend 22 26 mm decade 1 that is besides the local effects afforestation can also remotely affect the water resource availability in downwind areas similar conclusions have also been drawn in previous studies wang erlandsson et al 2018 suggested that land cover change can impact remote prec through land atmosphere interactions e g precipitation recycling weng et al 2019 reported that upwind large scale afforestation 71 000 km2 could increase prec over a downwind city by 1 25 yr 1 unfortunately the current governance of water resources rarely considers the remote effect of afforestation dalin et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 our study emphasizes that the assessment of the impact of afforestation should be carried out in a comprehensive manner therefore evaluating the remote influence of the gfgp on downwind regions is a direction for our future work 5 conclusions large scale afforestation i e the gfgp has a substantial impact on the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle over the lp but the way the atmospheric branch of the hydrological cycle responds to the gfgp is currently unknown this study quantified the impact of the large scale afforestation of the lp on the awc in the rainy season we used wrf simulation from controlled experiments to drive an analytical model of precipitation recycling and then investigated the responses of various components of the awc to gfgp afforestation based on our results the following conclusions can be drawn the gfgp intensified the rainy season awc and increased the precipitation and atmospheric water vapor over the lp the gfgp significantly increased the et and prr over the lp and the contribution of the internal branch of the awc to increased precipitation was 15 51 the gfgp caused more advected moisture to be converted into precipitation and the contribution of the external branch of the awc to increased precipitation was 84 49 both the inflow and outflow moisture fluxes of the lp increased after the implementation of the gfgp the inflow increase was larger than that of the outflow leading to more moisture being retained on the lp the enhanced lh induced by the gfgp reinforced surface diabatic heating and caused an abnormal cyclone resulting in increased moisture advection from the southern boundary after the gfgp the changed thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere are more conducive to precipitation formation this study highlights the ability of afforestation to intensify the awc and exert a positive impact on water resource availability we suggest that changes in the external branch of the awc rather than those in the internal branch dominate the increase in precipitation induced by afforestation our study also illustrates that afforestation can increase the moisture supply for downwind areas moreover the way in which afforestation remotely affects the regional climate and hydrological cycle of downwind areas remains an interesting subject for future research our conclusions provide new perspectives for assessing the climatic effect of afforestation and can help policymakers formulate science

2138,afforestation is an efficient measure to mitigating climate change and achieving carbon neutrality however there is a growing concern regarding the impact of afforestation on water resource availability owing to the water consumption through evapotranspiration et the loess plateau lp in china has implemented the largest afforestation program in the world the grain for green program gfgp to curtail severe soil erosion however the effects of large scale afforestation on the atmospheric branch of the hydrological cycle i e the atmospheric water cycle awc are poorly understood combining a regional climate model and an analytical precipitation recycling model this study quantitatively investigated the responses of precipitation recycling and components of the atmospheric water cycle to the gfgp over the lp during the rainy season two long term simulations with high resolution were conducted for the lp s regional climate under two scenarios with and without the implementation of the gfgp results show that the gfgp intensified the awc and increased the precipitation and atmospheric water vapor the gfgp enhanced the et and precipitation recycling ratio of the internal branch of the awc which contributed 15 51 of the increased precipitation meanwhile the contribution of the external branch was 84 49 in addition both the inflow and outflow moisture fluxes showed increases induced by the gfgp the inflow was larger than the outflow leading to more moisture being retained on the lp moreover the enhanced et reinforced surface diabatic heating and caused an abnormal cyclone resulting in more moisture being advected from the southern boundary which can partly counteract the weakening east asian summer monsoon furthermore the gfgp has remotely strengthened the water vapor advection being received by downwind areas this work advances the current understanding of the way large scale afforestation affects the hydrological cycle from the viewpoint of the awc and can help direct future afforestation plans towards science informed carbon neutrality and sustainable ecosystem management keywords afforestation precipitation recycling atmospheric water cycle wrf model loess plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction afforestation has been considered an adequate strategy to mitigate climate change given its positive role in carbon neutrality branch and wulfmeyer 2019 swann et al 2012 it is also an efficient way to protect the ecosystem and curb soil erosion feng et al 2016 however afforestation can enhance or reduce regional water availability by altering evapotranspiration et streamflow precipitation and soil moisture hoek van dijke et al 2022 when to assess the influence of afforestation numerous studies have concentrated on the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle qiu et al 2021 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 but have paid little attention to its atmospheric branch that is the atmospheric water cycle awc e g atmospheric water and precipitation recycling moreover atmospheric water is an important water resource mainly influenced by the processes of moisture flux advection and moisture recycling these processes of the awc can be modified by afforestation through land atmosphere interaction meier et al 2021 yosef et al 2018 however the ways in which the awc responds to afforestation are still poorly understood there is an urgent need to advance our knowledge of such responses facilitating the formulation of sustainable global afforestation policies especially in water limited regions atmospheric water over a region originates from two sources advected external water vapor and evaporated internal water vapor eltahir and bras 1996 the former refers to water vapor flowing into a region through external advection and the latter refers to water vapor from local et the process of converting evaporated internal water vapor into precipitation is called precipitation recycling dominguez et al 2006 previous studies have shown afforestation can lead to changes in these two sources of atmospheric water kemena et al 2018 suggested that afforestation of the sahara enhanced the obtainment of moisture advection mid latitude afforestation has been shown to lead to a shift in atmospheric circulation swann et al 2012 which affected moisture transport at a continental scale in addition syktus and mcalpine 2016 concluded that the restoration of woodlands in australia led to increased precipitation via the enhancement of et however as pointed out by wierik et al 2021 regional studies that aim to explore the effects of afforestation on regional climate remain scarce the chinese loess plateau lp comprises the largest loess area about 640 000 km2 in the world and contributes approximately 90 of the sediment that enters the yellow river wang et al 2016 to control severe soil erosion of the lp the chinese government launched a large scale afforestation program the grain for green program gfgp in the late 1990 s with an accumulated investment of us 54 570 million bryan et al 2018 the gfgp is well known as the largest afforestation program on earth cao et al 2019 as a result the ecological environment has been greatly improved the vegetation cover of the lp has dramatically increased by approximately 25 feng et al 2016 and the sediment content of the yellow river has markedly declined by approximately 80 zhao et al 2014 meanwhile the et of the lp has substantially increased at a rate of 4 30 mm yr 1 feng et al 2016 therefore the lp can serve as an ideal platform for exploring the hydroclimatic response to afforestation furthermore it is estimated that our planet still has an extra tree restoration potential of 9 million km2 under current climate conditions bastin et al 2019 given the recent announcement by the united nations of the decade on ecosystem restoration hoek van dijke et al 2022 a detailed investigation of the hydroclimatic effect of the gfgp will provide valuable insights for similar regions intensive land cover change induced by the gfgp has profoundly affected the hydrological cycle and the availability of water resources over the lp feng et al 2016 luan et al 2022 qiu et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 feng et al 2016 used a creative conceptual model which suggested that the gfgp has resulted in sustainable water resources of the lp reaching their limit but this did not consider the impact of the gfgp on precipitation using a coupled land atmosphere global climate model y li et al 2018 pointed out that the increased precipitation induced by the improved vegetation cover can partly offset the enhanced et resulting from the gfgp and such an impact on precipitation has usually been overlooked using the weather research and forecasting model wrf zhang et al 2021 also found that the gfgp has exerted a positive impact on regional precipitation over the lp however the impact of the gfgp on the awc has not been investigated in detail it remains unclear how the external e g moisture inflow and outflow and internal e g precipitation recycling components of the awc respond to the gfgp quantification of the relative contributions of advected external and evaporated internal moisture to regional precipitation i e precipitation recycling is central to the analysis of the response of the awc to the gfgp analytical models based on the conservation of atmospheric water vapor are efficient tools and are widely used to quantify precipitation recycling dominguez et al 2006 insua costa and miguez macho 2018 owing to the simplicity of calculation and economy of computational resources additionally reanalysis datasets are often used to drive the analytical models dominguez et al 2018 gimeno et al 2012 but their relatively coarse spatial resolution limits their application in regions with complex terrain a further limitation is that reanalysis datasets cannot be used to separate the effects of climate change and land cover change because they merely offer a numerical representation of the historical climate reichle et al 2017 tariku and gan 2018 in contrast with high spatial resolutions regional climate models rcms are able to realize various simulations with different artificially controlled boundary conditions and then isolate the net effect of land cover change cao et al 2019 halder et al 2016 huang et al 2020 consequently using output from rcms to drive analytical models is an appropriate option to quantitatively diagnose precipitation recycling over a region this study aims to quantify the effect of large scale afforestation i e the gfgp on the awc of the lp the precipitation recycling analysis is performed using the wrf model in conjunction with an analytical model first we conducted two long term wrf simulations under scenarios with and without the occurrence of the gfgp next changes in precipitation and atmospheric water induced by the gfgp were analyzed responses of the internal and external branches of the awc to the gfgp were then investigated in detail finally we systematically diagnosed the physical mechanism to interpret the influence of the gfgp this study attempts to address the following questions 1 how do precipitation and atmospheric water respond to the gfgp 2 to what extent does the gfgp affect precipitation recycling 3 how does the gfgp modify regional moisture transport 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lp is situated in the upper and middle reaches fig 1 a of the yellow river basin in north central china 33 41 41 51 n 99 113 40 e with a population of 97 81 million li et al 2021 the lp is a crucial region for the nation it plays an important role in the eco security shield for reducing sediment and the risk of flooding in downstream regions the plateau has a complex topography with an elevation that varies from 91 to 4 812 m the plateau is located in the transitional zone between semi arid and semi humid regions wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 and the annual mean 2 m air temperature ranges from 4 to 14 1982 2015 the annual mean et varies from 150 to 600 mm yr 1 the annual mean precipitation varies from 200 to 800 mm yr 1 1982 2015 and 68 71 of this precipitation is concentrated during the rainy season from june to september tang et al 2018 which is controlled by the east asian summer monsoon zhang et al 2011 the lp has suffered severe soil erosion owing to the high erodibility of loess and serious farming activities feng et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 with the aim of protecting the regional ecosystem the gfgp was launched to convert cropland to grassland and forest across the lp hence the gfgp led to an extreme change in land cover lc fig 1b shows that there were 54 types of lc conversion between 1999 and 2015 with the top five conversion types contributing 83 57 of the changed area across the lp the converted areas from cropland to grassland and from barren land to grassland were 33 664 and 13 563 km2 respectively this accounts for approximately 60 of the top five conversion types detailed spatial information is provided in fig s1 consequently the fraction of vegetation cover fvc in the rainy season substantially increased over most areas 91 45 of the lp fig 1c with an increase of 4 13 decade 1 after the initiation of the gfgp compared with 1 18 decade 1 before the gfgp fig s2 a meanwhile 70 69 of the lp area experienced an upward trend of precipitation in the rainy season fig 1d with an increase of 18 49 mm decade 1 after the initiation of the gfgp compared with a decreasing trend 2 99 mm decade 1 before the gfgp fig s2b given the greening and wetting trends after the initiation of the gfgp this work aims to unravel the impact of the gfgp on the awc during the rainy season 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 forcing datasets in this study we adopted the european centre for medium range weather forecasts interim reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 to drive the wrf model the era interim supplied initial and boundary atmospheric conditions for our wrf simulations it has been widely employed to force previous regional climate modeling and shows excellent performance over the lp cao et al 2019 ge et al 2020 the era interim has a horizontal resolution of 0 75 and 60 vertical levels up to 0 1 hpa this reanalysis dataset supplies variables on the land surface and pressure levels at an interval of 6 h in addition lc forcing data in this study was acquired from the climate change initiative program of the european space agency esa cci lc plummer et al 2017 the esa cci lc dataset provides annual global lc maps with a spatial resolution of 300 m covering the period 1992 to 2015 it presents a consistent time series by absorbing multiple observational products with high accuracy and has wide application in climate modeling w li et al 2018 liu et al 2021 moreover we obtained land forcing data from the global land surface satellite glass datasets liang et al 2013 which offer important parameters associated with land surface processes related to vegetation in the wrf including monthly albedo leaf area index lai and fvc the above land forcing data was used to set up different scenarios within wrf simulations details of the experimental settings are presented in section 2 3 2 2 2 evaluation datasets simulated precipitation was validated based on a gridded dataset the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd the cmfd assimilates in situ observations reanalysis data and remote sensing products he et al 2020 and has a spatial resolution of 0 1 covering the period 1979 2018 at a monthly scale owing to its high spatial resolution and accuracy the cmfd has been widely used in model validation in china shao et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 in addition the simulated land surface temperature lst was assessed using a global monthly land surface temperature dataset developed by chen et al 2017 which was produced using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis datasets the spatial resolution of this lst dataset is 0 05 0 05 and it covers the period 2000 2020 moreover we adopted an ensemble et dataset to evaluate our et simulations in order to decrease the uncertainties in et products three products were used to derive the ensemble et dataset these were the modified priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl dataset shao et al 2019 global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 3a gleamv3 3a dataset martens et al 2017 and penman monteith leuning model version 1 pml v1 dataset zhang et al 2016 the three et datasets were interpolated to 0 1 using the bilinear interpolation method and then the ensemble et product was calculated as the average of the three interpolated et datasets during their shared period detailed information regarding the datasets used in this work can be found in table s1 2 3 wrf model and experiment design 2 3 1 wrf model the wrf version 3 6 model was employed in this study this mesoscale forecast model is a fully compressible and non hydrostatic model that uses the terrain following coordinate and has a variety of physical schemes skamarock et al 2008 the wrf has been broadly applied to study regional climate change at high spatial resolution zhang et al 2022 in this study the wrf was configured with a single domain covering the whole lp fig 1a the domain had a horizontal resolution of 10 km and consisted of 160 160 grids with a projection of lambert conformal conic the center of the domain was at 37 n 108 e with a boundary covering less mountainous regions as far as possible to reduce the effect of complex topography on the simulation the model had 30 layers up to 50 hpa in the vertical direction we used an optimal combination of wrf schemes for the lp as suggested by tian et al 2022a such an optimal combination was derived through comprehensive sensitivity tests and has been shown to greatly improve regional climate modeling of the lp interested readers can refer to tian et al 2022a for details of this combination table s2 lists the physical schemes used in this study 2 3 2 experiment design to isolate the net effect of the gfgp on the awc we conducted two numerical experiments using the same optimal physical schemes the simulations ran from september 1999 to december 2015 and the spin up periods were set as four months from the previous year september to december to minimize the uncertainties introduced by initial conditions the land surface driving data were the only differences between the two simulations the control experiment wrf ctl used the wrf default land forcing data to represent a hypothetical scenario in which the gfgp did not occur in contrast the dynamic vegetation experiment wrf dyn updated the default land forcing data with annual lc datasets from the esa cci lc and monthly glass datasets during the period 2000 2015 to reflect the actual land cover condition induced by the gfgp because the lc classification system in esa cci lc adopted the standard of the food and agriculture organization we reclassed the lc data into the united states geological survey classification system which is recognized by the wrf and then re gridded the reclassed lc data to the curvilinear grid of the wrf the essential parameters i e albedo lai and fvc obtained from the glass datasets were bilinearly interpolated to 0 1 and then re gridded to the wrf curvilinear grid we only replaced the annual lc and monthly parameters data within the lp thus the difference between wrf ctl and wrf dyn can be used to quantify the net influence of the gfgp 2 4 analysis methods 2 4 1 dynamic precipitation recycling model the dynamic precipitation recycling model dprm is an analytical model dominguez et al 2006 that is mainly applied to derive the precipitation recycling ratio prr this model has a simple calculation process and can explore the spatial distribution of the prr wang et al 2021 unlike traditional analytical models it can be used at multiple time scales daily monthly and longer given its consideration of the change in the atmospheric water vapor dominguez et al 2020 details of the dprm can be found in dominguez et al 2006 here we briefly introduce the dprm as follows the change in water vapor in the entire atmospheric column can be described as the conservation equation of atmospheric water vapor eq 1 which is applicable for both grid and regional scales 1 p w v t p w v u x p w v v y e t p r e c where pwv indicates the precipitable water vapor p w v t indicates the temporal variation in pwv u v is the vertically integrated moisture weighted zonal meridional wind speed p w v u x p w v v y represents the vertically integrated moisture flux divergence and et and prec denote the evapotranspiration and precipitation respectively furthermore the total water vapor can be divided into the internal recycled component and external advected component and we can obtain eq 2 by separating the recycled component from eq 1 2 pwv r t pwv r u x pwv r v y e t r p where pwvr is the recycled evaporated component of pwv pwv r t is the temporal variation in pwvr pwv r u x pwv r v y represents the vertically integrated moisture flux divergence originating from et and rp represents the recycled precipitation additionally given the assumption that the two sources of water vapor are well mixed the ratio ρ prr in a grid of recycled precipitation rp to total precipitation prec is equal to the ratio of recycled water vapor pwvr to total water vapor pwv that is 3 prec r p prec a p w v pwv r pwv a ρ rp prec pwv r pwv therefore by applying eqs 1 and 3 to eq 2 we can derive the formula of the prr in a grid ρ 4 ρ 1 e x p 0 t et pwv d t finally the prr of the entire region can be calculated using the ρ and precipitation of all grids within the region 5 prr region i 1 n ρ i prec i δ a i i 1 n prec i δ a i where prrregion denotes the prr of the whole region and ρi preci and δai denote the prr precipitation and area of the grid i within the region respectively 2 4 2 metrics for evaluation and statistical analysis the pattern correlation coefficient pcc root mean square error rmse and mean bias error bias were applied to evaluate the spatiotemporal performance of the wrf simulations the formulas of these metrics are as follows argüeso et al 2012 wang et al 2020 6 pcc i 1 n x obs i x obs x wrf i x wrf i 1 n x obs i x obs 2 i 1 n x wrf i x wrf 2 7 rmse i 1 n x wrf i x obs i 2 n 8 bias i 1 n x wrf i x obs i n where i denotes the grid i in the spatial evaluation and the time i in the temporal validation n denotes the total number of grids within the study region or years during the verified period x obs i is the observation ranking of i x obs is the average of n observations x wrf i is the re gridded simulation ranking of i and x wrf is the average of the n re gridded simulations the trend analysis used in this study was linear regression based on the ordinary least squares method this method calculates the slope of the time series to depict the overall trend of the climate variables before and after the gfgp the student s t test was further applied to evaluate the significance of the linear fitting trend meanwhile the student s t test was utilized to determine whether the impact of the gfgp on the awc was significant or not the difference was considered a significant change if it passed the test at a significance level of 95 2 4 3 potential vorticity diagnosis potential vorticity pv diagnosis has been widely employed to diagnose the dynamic and thermodynamic conditions of the atmosphere xie et al 2018 we investigated the effect of surface diabatic heating on moisture convergence based on the pv budget equation zhang et al 2019 the pv at the grid scale can be calculated in the p vertical coordinate as shown in eq 9 9 p v t u p v x v p v y w p v p g v p q x u p q y f ξ p q p where u v and w represent zonal wind speed meridional wind speed and vertical velocity respectively g denotes gravitational acceleration q denotes diabatic heating rate f denotes coriolis parameter and ξ p v x u y denotes the vertical component of relative vorticity the regional pv budget can be expressed in the form of an area integral as shown in eq 10 and the change in regional pv qtnd can be decomposed into three different contributions the net cross boundary pv fluxes qbnd the condensing or diluting rates of area integrated pv owing to 3d velocity divergence qcon and the pv production rates induced by diabatic heating qdbh 10 s p v t d s s v 3 p v d s s p v v 3 d s s g ξ a q d s where s p v t d s is qtnd s v 3 p v d s is qbnd s p v v 3 d s is qcon and s g ξ a q d s is qdbh the qbnd2d qcon2d and qdbh2d stand for the horizontal component of each corresponding term respectively 3 results 3 1 evaluation of wrf simulations the capability of the wrf model to reproduce the regional climate is an essential prerequisite to quantifying the effects of large scale afforestation this study first evaluated the accuracy of wrf simulations in capturing precipitation prec lst and et fig 2 over the lp which are fundamental variables of hydrological and energy processes the spatiotemporal assessment of prec is shown in the first column of fig 2 it is clear that both wrf ctl fig 2d and wrf dyn fig 2g successfully captured the observed spatial pattern fig 2a of prec specifically the pcc and rmse of wrf ctl wrf dyn were 0 86 0 88 and 60 80 mm yr 1 48 02 mm yr 1 respectively in addition the biases of wrf ctl and wrf dyn were compared at a grid scale fig 2j the mean bias of wrf ctl was 37 50 mm yr 1 the magnitude of which was considerably larger than that of wrf dyn 1 83 mm yr 1 moreover fig 2m shows a comparison of the temporal variation in annual area averaged prec where the time series of wrf dyn is closer to that of the observations than is wrf ctl thus wrf dyn incorporating the real lc change over the lp has a higher degree of agreement with prec observations than does wrf ctl we further evaluated the performance of the wrf in simulating lst over the lp by comparing the spatial distributions of climatological lst from observations wrf ctl and wrf dyn fig 2b e h the pccs of both wrf ctl and wrf dyn were 0 95 and the rmses were 1 60 and 1 41 respectively additionally the lst comparison between the two wrf simulations at a grid scale is displayed in fig 2k the ratio of the bias of wrf dyn to that of wrf ctl was 0 83 indicating that wrf dyn had a smaller bias than did wrf ctl fig 2n shows the temporal variations in wrf ctl and wrf dyn the r2 and rmse of wrf ctl wrf dyn were 0 63 0 72 and 0 60 0 47 respectively hence both wrf lst simulations were able to approximate the observations but wrf dyn performed better similarly the right hand column of fig 2 examines the ability of the wrf to mirror the observed et as shown in fig 2f and i a spatial comparison of climatological et showed that the pccs and rmses of wrf ctl wrf dyn were 0 82 0 84 and 45 64 mm yr 1 41 97 mm yr 1 respectively at a grid scale fig 2l the mean bias of wrf ctl wrf dyn was 23 26 mm yr 1 1 25 mm yr 1 for the temporal variation in annual area averaged et fig 2o the rmse of wrf dyn 9 01 mm yr 1 was substantially less than that of wrf ctl 22 57 mm yr 1 which indicates that wrf dyn was closer to the et observations in summary the above evaluation illustrates that the wrf simulation with real land cover forcing i e wrf dyn can adequately represent variables relevant to the hydrological and energy processes while the non afforestation scenario i e wrf ctl produced results that deviated markedly from the observations such an outperformance of wrf dyn over wrf ctl provides considerable confidence for our subsequent numerical experiments to quantify the influence of the gfgp furthermore the difference between the wrf dyn and wrf ctl can be used to isolate the net impact of large scale afforestation on the awc over the lp see sections 3 2 3 4 3 2 impact of large scale afforestation on water vapor transport 3 2 1 precipitation and precipitable water vapor the effect of the gfgp on the awc is directly reflected in the change in prec fig 3 a shows the temporal variability in annual prec difference δprec wrf dyn minus wrf ctl after the introduction of the gfgp all years exhibited a positive δprec with a mean value of 32 44 mm yr 1 these values were statistically significant at the 95 confidence level fig 3b demonstrates that prec increased in most areas 99 95 of the lp after the introduction of the gfgp these results suggest that the gfgp exerted a positive impact on regional prec over the lp the increased prec also indicates that the awc underwent considerable changes under the scenario of large scale afforestation we investigated changes in the precipitable water vapor pwv over the lp because pwv in the atmosphere supplies moisture during the formation of precipitation as shown in fig 3c positive pwv differences δpwv dominated all years after the introduction of the gfgp with a mean δpwv of 0 64 mm 90 confidence level fig 3d shows the spatial pattern of climatological δpwv where the entire lp is dominated by positive δpwv with a maximum δpwv of 1 19 mm spatiotemporal analysis of δpwv revealed that the gfgp caused the increase in pwv over the lp the increased pwv results from changes in the external and internal branches of moisture transport in the awc the following section will scrutinize the responses of moisture transport to the gfgp and explore the physical reasons for these responses 3 2 2 evaporated internal water vapor local water vapor evaporated through et is an important contributor to atmospheric water vapor over the lp to quantify the response of evaporated internal water vapor to the gfgp we investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of et changes δet et difference between wrf dyn and wrf ctl as depicted in fig 4 a positive δet was presented in all years after the introduction of the gfgp with a mean δet of 26 38 mm yr 1 99 confidence level additionally positive δet covered 86 85 of the lp fig 4b and δet was statistically significant in a large proportion of areas 62 19 hence this spatiotemporal analysis demonstrates that the amount of evaporated internal water vapor has increased significantly under the influence of the gfgp furthermore the relationship between the fraction of vegetation cover fvc and et was analyzed there has been a rapid upward trend in fvc 4 13 decade 1 fig s2a and the changes in fvc fig 1c and et fig 4b show similar spatial patterns characterized by a widespread increase over the lp and higher values clustering around the southeastern lp the correlation coefficient between the rainy season δet and δfvc was 0 64 99 confidence level therefore we can conclude that the significant greening trend induced by the gfgp led to the increased et which is in accordance with previous studies feng et al 2016 luan et al 2022 3 2 3 advected external water vapor advected moisture from outside the study area is another source of atmospheric water vapor over the lp we quantified changes in the inflow and outflow of moisture flux after the introduction of the gfgp fig 5 to this end the boundary of the lp was divided into 14 edges fig 5a including 8 inflow edges blue and 6 outflow edges red according to the climatological state of the vertically integrated moisture flux vimf over the lp in details we calculated the mean annual vimf during the rainy season and then obtained these edges through keeping less difference between directions of the vimf above the same edge as possible fig 5a shows the spatial pattern of vimf difference δvimf between wrf dyn and wrf ctl a comparison of the climatological vimf between wrf ctl and wrf dyn is shown in fig s3 a positive δvimf with a mean value of 0 93 kg m 1 s 1 is shown to dominate most areas 75 67 of the lp revealing a strengthening transport of moisture flux caused by the gfgp a detailed analysis was conducted with respect to moisture flux changes at each edge as depicted in fig 5b the moisture flux of five inflow edges 3 4 11 12 and 13 increased while that of three inflow edges 1 2 and 9 decreased edges 3 and 4 at the southern boundary dominated the changes in the inflow edges meanwhile the moisture flux of four outflow edges 6 7 8 and 10 increased while that of two outflow edges 5 and 14 decreased edges 6 7 and 8 at the eastern boundary dominated the changes in the outflow edges in total fig 5c both the climatological inflow and outflow of moisture flux increased after the introduction of the gfgp with increases of 15 67 105 and 11 99 105 kg s 1 respectively however the increase in inflow was larger than that of outflow and thus the net moisture flow flux exhibited an increase of 3 68 105 kg s 1 indicating that implementation of the gfgp resulted in more water vapor being retained within the lp in summary the impact of gfgp strengthened not only the internal but also the external branches of moisture transport 3 3 impact of large scale afforestation on the atmospheric water cycle 3 3 1 precipitation recycling following the analysis of atmospheric water transport the effect of the gfgp on the conversion from evaporated water vapor to prec was further probed using the precipitation recycling ratio prr fig 6 a shows the spatial pattern of the prr difference δprr between wrf dyn and wrf ctl where positive δprr occupies 84 10 of the entire lp area over 40 of the lp area showed a significant 95 confidence level increase in prr and this was mainly distributed in the central and eastern parts of the plateau additionally the inset of fig 6a demonstrates that the difference between the prr of wrf dyn and wrf ctl was significant 99 confidence level at a grid scale while the mean prr of wrf ctl and wrf dyn was 8 18 and 8 91 respectively moreover as the time series of annual δprr shows fig s4a positive δprr was displayed in all years after the implementation of the gfgp with a mean δprr of 0 73 statistically significant at 99 confidence level these results imply that the gfgp enhanced the efficiency of conversion from evaporated water vapor to prec we subsequently assessed the contributions of the internal and external branches of the awc to δprec over the lp fig 6b displays the spatial pattern of the difference in recycled precipitation rp that originates from evaporated internal water vapor most areas 95 89 of the lp exhibited a positive difference in rp δrp and rp increased significantly 95 confidence level in 35 88 of lp areas after the implementation of the gfgp additionally the inset of fig 6b compares the rp of the two wrf simulations at a grid scale the rp was significantly different between wrf ctl and wrf dyn the mean rp of wrf ctl and wrf dyn were 23 27 and 28 30 mm yr 1 respectively furthermore the time series of δrp shown in fig s4b shows a significant positive rp difference after the introduction of the gfgp 99 confidence level with a mean δrp of 5 03 mm yr 1 thus rp increased significantly in response to the implementation of the gfgp fig 6c inspects the change in prec originating from advected external water vapor preca with positive δpreca widely distributed 99 93 over the lp the inset shows the preca difference 90 confidence level between wrf ctl and wrf dyn at a grid scale with mean preca of 241 89 and 269 30 mm yr 1 respectively in addition the temporal variation in δpreca exhibited large positive differences in all years after the implementation of the gfgp with a mean δpreca of 27 41 mm yr 1 fig s4b consequently preca increased substantially in response to the gfgp in general both rp and preca have been elevated by the impact of the gfgp but preca has changed more markedly 27 41 mm yr 1 relative to rp 5 03 mm yr 1 that is the contributions of changes in the internal and external branches of the awc to the increased prec induced by the gfgp were 15 51 and 84 49 respectively such an dominant contribution 84 49 indicates that the increase in prec has mainly been caused by the intensified external branch of the awc 3 3 2 atmospheric water budget to clarify the impact of the gfgp on the awc over the lp we used a schematic diagram to describe changes in the different components of the awc fig 7 it should be noted that all values i e differences between wrf dyn and wrf ctl were divided by the climatological value of δprec and then multiplied by 100 for ease of reading guo et al 2018 additionally fig s5 shows the climatological atmospheric water budget of wrf ctl and wrf dyn for the internal branch of the awc all components have significantly changed 99 confidence level in detail et has increased by 81 31 a relative change of 14 27 the portion of et that is converted into regional precipitation rp has increased by 15 51 21 66 and the remainder of the et that flows out of the region fout r has increased by 65 80 13 21 for the external branch of the awc the advected external water vapor that flows into the region fin has increased by 79 59 2 24 the portion of fin that is converted into regional precipitation preca has increased by 84 49 11 33 and the remainder of fin that flows out of the region fout a has decreased by 4 90 0 17 furthermore the water vapor that flows out of the region fout the sum of fout a and fout r has increased by 60 90 1 84 mainly attributed to an increase in fout r indicating that enhanced et sustains moisture outflow from the lp to downwind regions 3 4 atmospheric diagnosis of responses in the atmospheric water cycle 3 4 1 thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere we further performed a detailed atmospheric diagnosis to explore the physical mechanism of the intensified awc induced by the gfgp fig 8 a demonstrates the difference δq in specific humidity q between wrf dyn and wrf ctl which represents the change in the moisture condition near the surface 800 hpa pressure level after the implementation of the gfgp the q increased over almost the entire lp 97 85 and the mean δq was 0 27 g kg 1 indicating a more humid atmosphere under the wrf dyn scenario in addition fig 8b shows the change in the horizontal wind at the 800 hpa pressure level there was an obvious cyclonic circulation over the lp after the implementation of the gfgp indicating an enhanced moisture convergence this abnormal cyclone also resulted in a stronger southwesterly wind at the southern boundary of the lp which is in accordance with the strengthened inflow of moisture flux fig 5b in fig 8c we show the changes δcape in convective available potential energy cape a measure of the convective instability of the entire atmosphere after the implementation of the gfgp positive δcape covered a high proportion 95 97 of the entire lp with a mean δcape of 28 34 j kg 1 and the cape increased significantly over 44 34 of the lp 95 confidence level moreover the inset of fig 8c also shows a remarkable difference in the cape between wrf ctl and wrf dyn at a regional scale after the introduction of the gfgp with mean capes of 183 72 and 212 06 j kg 1 respectively the reinforced cape illustrates that more energy was available for the development of convection furthermore as per the profiles shown in fig 8d compared with wrf ctl vertical velocity in wrf dyn showed increases at all pressure levels from 850 to 300 hpa indicating the intensification of uplift movement in the atmosphere after the implementation of the gfgp in summary after the implementation of the gfgp an abnormal cyclone led to moisture advection from the southern boundary and a change in the thermodynamic properties of the atmospheric condition was more conducive to precipitation formation 3 4 2 surface energy fluxes and diabatic heating fluxes associated with the surface energy budget were further analyzed because the atmospheric state is tightly related to energy exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere fig 9 a depicts the spatial pattern of sensible heat flux sh difference δsh between wrf ctl and wrf dyn positive δsh occupies 57 10 of the lp with a mean δsh of 1 70 w m 2 in addition the inset shows the slight increase in sh in wrf dyn 51 36 w m 2 compared with wrf ctl 49 66 w m 2 however latent heat flux lh shows a more obvious increase than that of sh as shown in fig 9b positive δlh dominates 86 83 of the area of the lp with a mean δlh of 6 18 w m 2 the lh increased significantly over 62 21 of the lp 95 confidence level in addition the inset of fig 9b also shows a significant difference between wrf ctl and wrf dyn 99 confidence level with mean lhs of 42 92 and 49 10 w m 2 respectively therefore both sh and lh increased after the gfgp implying an increase in surface diabatic heating that was dominated by enhanced lh the potential vorticity pv was next diagnosed to clarify the impact of surface diabatic heating fig 9c shows the vertical profile of differences δqtnd in the time rates of area integrated pv changes qtnd from 800 to 300 hpa δqtnd is distinctly larger than zero in the lower atmosphere from 800 to 750 hpa the occurrence of positive δqtnd indicates the regional potential vorticity of near surface atmosphere increased after the implementation of the gfgp in addition we analyzed the vertical profiles of differences in the components of the pv budget fig 9d with the profiles of each component in the pv budgets of wrf ctl and wrf dyn shown in fig s6 as fig 9d shows the three components in the qtnd budget are qbnd3d qcon3d and qdbh3d the change in qdbh3d δqdbh3d was evidently larger than those in the other two components and thus δqdbh3d dominated the positive δqtnd fig 9c additionally the change in the vertical component of qdbh3d provided the larger contribution 69 94 to the δqdbh3d this indicates that intensified surface diabatic heating was the main driver of the pv increase hence enhanced lh was the main contributor to the reinforced surface diabatic heating subsequently causing the stronger cyclonic vorticity fig 8b in the lower atmosphere 4 discussion to alleviate severe soil erosion china has carried out a large scale afforestation program the gfgp over the lp in the context of rising concerns about water security over this water limited region branch and wulfmeyer 2019 luan et al 2022 we quantified the net impact of the gfgp on the atmospheric branch of the hydrological cycle using high resolution wrf simulations as far as we are aware this is the first study to quantify the response of the awc to the gfgp in terms of precipitation recycling and atmospheric moisture budget we found that the gfgp intensified the awc and increased the regional prec and atmospheric moisture our findings are well supported by previous studies which pointed out that the gfgp had a positive impact on regional prec by considering land atmosphere interactions cao et al 2019 y li et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 however these studies did not further investigate the response of the awc conversely studies exist feng et al 2016 qiu et al 2021 yu et al 2021 which suggest that excessive afforestation is responsible for a decline in streamflow and soil moisture over the lp these studies mainly used offline land surface hydrological and physical based conceptual models which overlooked the potential feedback of prec ge et al 2020 in fact the indirect precipitation recycling effects of large scale afforestation can counterbalance direct et effects hoek van dijke et al 2022 therefore this study advances our understanding of the climatic impact of the gfgp from the perspective of the awc water evaporated by local et can partly be recycled as local prec dominguez et al 2006 using high resolution wrf output to drive a precipitation recycling model we assessed the net impact of the gfgp on precipitation recycling over the lp we found that the gfgp enhanced the prr by 0 73 indicating that the efficiency of conversion of et to prec was elevated after the implementation of the gfgp wang et al 2021 and tian et al 2022b reported that the prr increased after the introduction of the gfgp but they did not isolate the contribution of the gfgp given regional climate change is also an important factor affecting the prr an et al 2017 this was mainly because wang et al 2021 used a reanalysis dataset which comprised mixed climate change and afforestation information to drive their dprm in addition we here report that increased et contributed approximately 16 of the increased prec which underscores the impact of land use change on prec in temperate regions wierik et al 2021 this study also suggests a strong relationship between afforestation and increased et the gfgp has previously been reported to be the main driver of increasing et luan et al 2022 enhanced et is attributed to sufficient soil moisture supply enhanced infiltration and water retention capacity deep roots and high conductance induced by high vegetation cover farley et al 2005 the atmospheric moisture budget is an essential aspect of the awc dennis and berbery 2022 this study specifically explored how the inflow and outflow of moisture fluxes responded to the gfgp over the lp we found that the gfgp led to more moisture being retained on the lp mainly attributed to increased inflow at the southern boundary through this boundary the east asian summer monsoon easm transports water vapor to the lp during the rainy season yang et al 2019 it has been reported that the easm has experienced significant weakening that has decreased moisture transport to the lp ding et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 which was mainly caused by the ocean variability and human aerosol forcing li et al 2010 zhou et al 2020 interestingly our study suggests that enhanced et led to an abnormal cyclone caused by a strengthening of diabatic heating further strengthening moisture transport across the southern boundary this finding confirms that afforestation can indirectly change atmospheric circulation by altering the exchanges of moisture momentum and energy between the land surface and atmosphere wierik et al 2021 previous studies have also shown that land cover change can affect atmospheric circulation and cause prec redistribution ruiz vásquez et al 2020 silva et al 2016 the present study highlights the positive impact of the gfgp on moisture transport which partly offsets the negative impact of the easm weakness we found that the enhanced et induced by the gfgp not only provides moisture for regional precipitation recycling but also transports considerable amounts of water vapor to downwind areas e g the north china plain the north china plain ncp is a fundamental breadbasket for china as shown in fig 10 although the area averaged precipitation of the ncp slightly decreased with a rate of 3 74 mm decade 1 most grids in the northern ncp of which moisture outflows from the east boundary of the loess plateau show an upward trend 22 26 mm decade 1 that is besides the local effects afforestation can also remotely affect the water resource availability in downwind areas similar conclusions have also been drawn in previous studies wang erlandsson et al 2018 suggested that land cover change can impact remote prec through land atmosphere interactions e g precipitation recycling weng et al 2019 reported that upwind large scale afforestation 71 000 km2 could increase prec over a downwind city by 1 25 yr 1 unfortunately the current governance of water resources rarely considers the remote effect of afforestation dalin et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 our study emphasizes that the assessment of the impact of afforestation should be carried out in a comprehensive manner therefore evaluating the remote influence of the gfgp on downwind regions is a direction for our future work 5 conclusions large scale afforestation i e the gfgp has a substantial impact on the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle over the lp but the way the atmospheric branch of the hydrological cycle responds to the gfgp is currently unknown this study quantified the impact of the large scale afforestation of the lp on the awc in the rainy season we used wrf simulation from controlled experiments to drive an analytical model of precipitation recycling and then investigated the responses of various components of the awc to gfgp afforestation based on our results the following conclusions can be drawn the gfgp intensified the rainy season awc and increased the precipitation and atmospheric water vapor over the lp the gfgp significantly increased the et and prr over the lp and the contribution of the internal branch of the awc to increased precipitation was 15 51 the gfgp caused more advected moisture to be converted into precipitation and the contribution of the external branch of the awc to increased precipitation was 84 49 both the inflow and outflow moisture fluxes of the lp increased after the implementation of the gfgp the inflow increase was larger than that of the outflow leading to more moisture being retained on the lp the enhanced lh induced by the gfgp reinforced surface diabatic heating and caused an abnormal cyclone resulting in increased moisture advection from the southern boundary after the gfgp the changed thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere are more conducive to precipitation formation this study highlights the ability of afforestation to intensify the awc and exert a positive impact on water resource availability we suggest that changes in the external branch of the awc rather than those in the internal branch dominate the increase in precipitation induced by afforestation our study also illustrates that afforestation can increase the moisture supply for downwind areas moreover the way in which afforestation remotely affects the regional climate and hydrological cycle of downwind areas remains an interesting subject for future research our conclusions provide new perspectives for assessing the climatic effect of afforestation and can help policymakers formulate science

corresponding author this manuscript was handled by emmanouil anagnostou editor in chief seasonal forecast of soil moisture at large spatial scale over forested landscape has numerous implications in forest hydrology and bushfire risk planning remotely sensed plant response to rainfall input meteorological forcing and site specific landscape attributes were integrated into a data driven gradient boosting machine learning ml model to forecast summer season december to february soil moisture equivalent to those from australian water resource assessment landscape awra l at root zone 0 1 m and deep 1 6 m layers of the soil multispectral and thermal infrared bands from modis band 1 12 lst day night and meteorological forcing for 2000 2018 during and prior to winter before august and site specific landscape attributes were used to generate the explanatory input variables to the model spatial and temporal forecasting skills of the model were evaluated using two types of cross validation two fold cross validation by space over the entire period 2000 2018 and two fold cross validation by time for all grid cells 2160 cells in the first method the model showed a high skill to forecast deep soil moisture r2 0 81 nse 0 79 rmse 58 01 mm and root zone soil moisture r2 0 65 nse 0 63 rmse 24 34 mm in comparison the second evaluation resulted in more accurate forecast deep soil moisture r2 0 88 nse 0 86 rmse 47 39 mm but in lower performance for root zone soil r2 0 55 nse 0 47 rmse 29 2 mm these outcomes have highlighted that the 80 variability in summers deep 1 6 m soil moisture and 50 variability in root zone 0 1 m soil moisture over forested landscape can be explained at the end of winters furthermore integrating remotely sensed observations has improved the results by showing an enhancement in the rmse by 22 8 33 3 in the deep 1 6 m soil moisture and 8 8 14 3 in root zone 0 1 m soil moisture overall the integrated system using remotely sensed plant response climate forcing and machine learning exhibit great potential to forecast summer soil moisture three months ahead in the mediterranean climates keywords asynchronous climate soil moisture forecast seasonal soil moisture machine learning lightgbm modis temperate forests awra l data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction seasonal 3 months ahead forecast of soil moisture across a large spatial extent is valuable for timely management actions required to enhance forest productivity and health it can also improve early prediction of processes linked to soil moisture such as carbon cycle modelling flood and drought vegetation water stress fuel moisture and streamflow an a priori knowledge of the probability of low soil moisture is of particular interest to stakeholders because low soil moisture is correlated with high fire danger drought and low streamflow these factors significantly impact the australian socio economy a prime example being regular large fire events that threaten human life agriculture and forest ecosystems allen et al 2010 fensham et al 2009 dry periods drive low streamflow increased threats to water availability khaledi et al 2022 water security is strongly linked to forest moisture status as forested catchments are a significant source of drinking water into most australian states bates et al 2008 recent projections of climate change models indicate more frequent occurrence of dry conditions in the coming decade bates et al 2008 booth et al 2015 dey et al 2019 evans et al 2017 herold et al 2018 to our best knowledge there is no operational seasonal soil moisture forecast system exists for australia although hydrological forecasting systems exist at global or continental scale including glofas e hype efas and ww hype arheimer et al 2020 arnal et al 2018 donnelly et al 2016 emerton et al 2018 vogel et al 2021 it is essential to note that global systems are not necessarily transferrable regionally because they may not realize regional climate and hydrological characteristics due to the spatial heterogeneity in climatic situations and land surface properties such as topography vegetation and soil texture hence a seasonal soil moisture forecast system developed and tested for australia is required seasonal soil moisture forecasts at the global scale are currently produced by coupling climate forecast models with hydrological models in this method process based hydrological models are forced with the climate forecasts generated through seasonal climate forecasting models arnal et al 2018 emerton et al 2018 however the operational implementation of these methods models are challenging as they are computationally expensive and require a considerable amount of data and resources to maintain the system arnal et al 2018 emerton et al 2018 also the input forcing data to climate and hydrological models are from sparsely located weather stations studies show that the spatial distribution and precision of rainfall measurements considerably influence the accuracy of the modelled soil moisture shen et al 2012 sun et al 2002 yin et al 2018 in addition landscape water storing capacity on which hydrological models rely on is inaccurate because it is impractical to measure them especially in upland forests affecting models output accuracy furthermore these models produce output at a coarse spatial resolution such as glofas 0 1 deg e hype ww hype and era 5 1000 km2 which may be too coarse for some applications like bushfire risk planning and streamflow predictions vogel et al 2021 studies suggest the need for soil moisture at high spatial resolution is rapidly increasing for many applications in hydrology agriculture and climatology kornelsen and coulibaly 2013 further the existing seasonal soil moisture forecast systems methods were primarily developed in and concentrated in europe and the us esit et al 2021 sehgal and sridhar 2019 these approaches may not always be transferrable to the australian context although some studies have attempted soil moisture forecast regionally they were limited to short term forecasts 7 days or limited to a few centimeters of soil further most of them were tested over agricultural fields because food security has been seen as more important than forest ecosystem conservation and knowing soil moisture dynamics in the upper few centimeters is adequate for many agricultural purposes however for long range forest health wildfire risk planning seven days forecast or even one month in advance is not sufficient in fact mediterranean forests depend on deep soil moisture during extensive dry seasons so knowing soil moisture only in 1 100 cm soil depth will not make much sense if the intention is to predict forest health wildfire risk and or streamflow these existing gaps can be addressed by developing a computationally light regional model using observed data at a large spatio temporal scale which can forecast soil moisture at different soil depths over the forested regions in better than existing 10 km spatial resolution there has been growing use of machine learning ml models due to their outstanding capability to extract features in historical data without requiring the knowledge of underlying processes lary et al 2016 these methods have been widely used to identify the linear or non linear relationship between predictor and predictand fahimi et al 2017 rhee and im 2017 the ml models can learn data patterns and produce predictions without a pre defined structure of the existing association between the input parameters alavi et al 2010 lantz 2019 sachindra and kanae 2019 although there is a general perception that ml approaches require extensive data for training a study by karandish and šimůnek 2016 showed that ml might provide a useful alternative to physical based models using limited input data which suggests that a computationally light model can be developed using ml methods more recently gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and deep learning dl approaches have attracted interests of modelers and data scientists due to their efficient learning capabilities especially for the time series problems out of many ml approaches the lightgbm ke et al 2017 and long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 are widely used for various applications moreover ml methods have demonstrated acceptable skills in forecasting hydro meteorological variables such asprecipitation barrera animas et al 2022 parmar et al 2017 drought khan et al 2020 rhee and im 2017 sundararajan et al 2021 streamflow feng et al 2020 ferreira et al 2021 rahimzad et al 2021 saraiva et al 2021 runoff kumar et al 2019 mohammadi 2021 flood mosavi et al 2018 water table depth

the last decade the application of ml has been broadly explored to predict retrieve soil moisture mostly over agricultural areas adab et al 2020 cai et al 2019 carranza et al 2021 dubois et al 2021 hong et al 2016 karandish and šimůnek 2016 karthikeyan and mishra 2021 matei et al 2017 with fewer studies on forests de oliveira et al 2021 senanayake et al 2021 the scarcity of in situ data in forested landscape and potential of satellite observations to include repeatedly obtained spatio temporal data has led to the extensive use of the ml approaches integrated with optical and thermal data from the satellite sensors particularly modis landsat and noaa avhrr to forecast predict or retrieve surface soil moisture over the forests along with other relevant variables adab et al 2020 ahmad et al 2010 korres et al 2015 petropoulos et al 2015 senanayake et al 2021 wang and qu 2009 however most of the studies have focused on real time soil moisture estimation adab et al 2020 ahmad et al 2010 fang et al 2017 jiang and cotton 2004 senanayake et al 2021 with only a few of them focusing on the long term soil moisture forecasting duan and kumar 2020 esit et al 2021 fang et al 2019 sehgal and sridhar 2019 this paper explores an ml based method for seasonal soil moisture forecast with a 3 month lead time at two different soil depths root zone 0 1 m and deep soil 1 6 m over forest regions in victoria in se australia previous work joshi et al 2022 found that in mediterranean regions like southeast australia plants primarily depend on the stored water from long past rainfall inputs therefore their location specific response to antecedent rainfall could relate to the landscape water storing capacity building on this understanding the present study has explored the integration of this mechanistic knowledge from joshi et al 2022 with remotely sensed forest observations meteorological data and landscape attributes like soil properties topography and some derived attributes to forecast summer season soil moisture at the end of the antecedent winter further this idea can be supported by the studies that suggest that plant optical thermal response to climate forcing could provide insights into groundwater storage capacity especially in the mediterranean regions dralle et al 2020 esit et al 2021 kundu et al 2017 li et al 2016 poméon et al 2018 yassin et al 2017 the study hypothesizes that integrating machine learning methods and continuously observed remotely sensed plant response to climate forcing will enhance the retrieval of the long range relationship between climate forcing and soil moisture accordingly incorporating modis into the machine learning methods will improve the skill for seasonal soil moisture forecast compared to the base model i e ml model without remotely sensed plant response to the climate forcing these two models were developed and compared for their capability to forecast seasonal soil moisture in this study due to scarcity of available observed soil moisture data at a large spatial scale the modelled soil moisture from awra l has been used as a pseudo ground truth for this study 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area encompasses the eucalypt forest region in victoria southeastern australia there are 23 forest types in victoria according to the vegetation spatial layer created by the agriculture department of the government of victoria and 11 bioregions as classified by the interim biogeographic regionalization for australia ibra7 these geographically distinctive bioregions are founded on shared climate geology landform and native vegetation the 11 bioregions are further divided into 30 subregions which are more localized and homogenous geomorphological units in each

drivers of rainfall and temperature are asynchronous in these regions as they are in the mediterranean climate classified under csa temperate dry summer hot summer and csb temperate dry summer warm summer by köppen geiger the regions of interest located in victoria have been sampled into 2160 grid cells of 0 05 x 0 05 lying over forest patches as shown in fig 1 the vegetation layer from national vegetation information system nvis australia version 6 0 has been used to identify these forest patches these data are available at the spatial resolution of 100 m nvis technical working group 2017 selection of the sampling grid cell size of 0 05 x 0 05 is determined 1 to remove the artifacts caused by the spatial discrepancy between modis optical available at 500 m and 1000 m and modis lst available at 1000 m 2 to make spatial resolution comparable as the modeled soil moisture data from awra l along with other meteorological and site specific data used in this study such as rainfall air

this study were accessed through the google earth engine gee platform gorelick et al 2017 the gee javascript code was used to mask the cloud pixels and the high quality pixels were extracted and saved in the comma separated files csv file which was used for further analysis 2 2 2 meteorological and modelled soil moisture the gridded meteorological datasets rainfall temperature vapour pressure deficit relative humidity and solar radiation at a spatial resolution of 0 05 x 0 05 were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology bom for a period of 19 years 2000 2018 the rainfall and temperature data are a part of bom s australian water availability project awap raupach et al 2009 awap provides the interpolated daily accumulated rainfall prior to 9 am local time minimum and maximum temperature values observed from the automatic weather station aws at 0 05 x 0 05 resolution jones et al 2009 numerous studies have used gridded rainfall and temperature products and the quality of the product is under the acceptable error limits for hydrological modelling chubb et al 2016 awra l s soil moisture outputs at root zone 0 1 m and deep 1 6 m hereafter root zone and deep soil was used as a reference data representing soil moisture dynamics awra l australian water resource assessment landscape is a landscape model developed by bom and commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization csiro and the model runs on a daily timestep and simulates the landscape water balance for australia from 1911 to present van dijk and warren 2010 the modelled soil moisture by awra l is the only soil moisture available at relatively high resolution over the australian continent and is validated for the several catchments in the victorian forest 2 2 3 site specific landscape attributes three categories of parameters were included in the model spatial location latitude longitude soil properties and elevation the soil attributes were obtained from a recent project called soil and landscape grid of australia slga https www clw csiro au aclep soilandlandscapegrid accessed on 25 october 2021 this dataset is the first continental version of the globalsoilmap idea containing a fine spatial resolution set of continuous soil characteristics with australia wide coverage it incorporates historical soil data new measurements with spectroscopic sensors and novel spatial modelling to generate national digital maps of soil features at 3 arcsec spatial resolution grundy et al 2015 viscarra rossel et al 2014 eleven soil attributes as shown in table 2 are available at each pixel accompanied by the confidence intervals for each estimate to a depth of 2 m or less the elevation data was obtained from the globally available shuttle radar topographic mission srtm at 30 m spatial resolution matching to the spatial resolution of awra l 0 05 x 0 05 all other input variables were averaged to this spatial resolution and then the dynamic time series observations were resampled to weekly timestamp by taking average of across seven days 3 methodology 3 1 modeling concept connection between wintertime rain and summertime soil moisture in asynchronous climate in asynchronous climate the vegetation in the extended dry periods mainly the deep rooted plants depends on the rainfall inputs from past wet events the present study has integrated this understanding of the rainfall landscape water storing capacity and plant available moisture relationship into the model via the plant s response in the summer season december january and february hereafter summertime to the rainfall in winter season august and before hereafter wintertime which on average represents 80 of annual rain two models hereafter called base model and integrated model as elaborated in fig 2 were developed to analyze and compare the significance of including mechanistic empirical knowledge of wintertime rain relationship to summertime soil moisture in forecasting summertime soil moisture a novel technique as described in 3 4 1 was explored to back calculate the size of the location specific wintertime rainfall time period hereafter termed rainfall windows to which vegetation responds in the summertime fig 3 along with other inputs as described in table 2 the accumulated rain corresponding to these rainfall windows was used as input to a machine learning ml model to forecast soil moisture three months ahead of time fig 3 that is represented as the integrated model while for comparison a base model was developed which uses all the input variables as in the integrated model except remotely sensed observations as shown in fig 2 the rainfall window size for the base model was calculated by the model itself described in detail in section 3 4 1 due to non existence of observed data at continental scale modelled awra l root zone and deep soil moisture is used as the truth dataset i e a proxy for actual soil moisture observations 3 2 machine learning ml model this study tested an ensemble gradient boosting method called lightgbm ke et al 2017 this approach efficiently implements the stochastic gradient boosting ensemble algorithms it extends gradient boosting by adding an automatic feature selection and is more focused on boosting with more significant gradients furthermore this algorithm adds two critical ideas to gradient boosting gradient based one side sampling goss and exclusive feature bundling efb these additional features accelerate the training time of the algorithm up to 20 times faster than the original gradient boosting algorithm while achieving almost the same accuracy ke et al 2017 also the outputs from these gradient boosting models are relatively more interpretable than the deep learning models for example each input variable s importance in predicting the output can be computed for the gradient boosting models to decide whether to keep or remove that input variable contributions of individual input variables to output predictions in the gradient boosting models are evaluated using the multi dimensional metric like shap shapley additive explanations more details of lightgbm can be found in ke et al 2017 3 3 choice and rationale of the input explanatory variables to the ml model feature selection the input explanatory variables to the ml model are categorized into three groups dynamic site specific and derived inputs as shown in table 2 the dynamic category includes historical time series observations and the site specific landscape attributes representing geomorphological characteristics which are considered constant for geolocation in contrast the derived category includes the specific property extracted from the long term historical time series weather observations for geolocation all these input time series variables were resampled by taking the mean value to match the spatial resolution of output awra l 0 05 the rationale behind choosing these input variables is presented in the following section 3 3 1 dynamic input variables air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity studies show that air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity has significant control on the evapotranspiration thus plays a significant role in soil water balance lofgren et al 2011 rahimikhoob 2010 zanetti et al 2007 rainfall this is the primary input climatic forcing that decides the amount of water input to the system wintertime rain was cumulated employing different methods for the base model and integrated model described in section 3 4 1 remotely sensed optical and thermal response of the plant to soil moisture the study assumed that the optical reflection through the forest canopy could link to the long term soil moisture condition as forests in these asynchronous climates depend on deep soil moisture optical reflection could indicate the long term moisture conditions numerous studies have used modis multispectral and thermal observations in one or more aspects of hydrological modelling and linking to transpiration status bohn and vivoni 2019 hwang et al 2008 ruhoff et al 2013 wang et al 2009 3 3 2 static landscape attributes elevation elevation could be a significant explanatory variable considering its effects on rainfall javari 2017 song et al 2019 temperature heynen et al 2016 kattel and yao 2018 phan et al 2018 vegetation functioning geng et al 2019 veen et al 2017 and soil depth amundson et al 2015 soil properties soil composition parameters determine the water holding capacity that controls overall soil moisture content and these could act as an important input explanatory variable to the machine learning model baroni et al 2013 huang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 geographical coordinates machine learning based approaches found a significant correlation and importance of geographical coordinates latitude longitude in predicting soil moisture at various depths de oliveira et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 this is likely the result of systematic variation of weather climate conditions with location particularly their meridional gradient based on these observations this study has considered location information an input explanatory variable to the model 3 3 3 derived input parameters some of the input parameters for the models were extracted using the long term 1911 2000 time series data the motivation for using these parameters is to distinguish the site characteristics based on the climate and location specific land processes these include the long term mean annual temperature and precipitation and the long term ratio of wintertime rainfall to summer season soil moisture for each 2160 study sampling windows this long term ratio could be significant in relating to the geomorphological conditions based on how much wintertime rainfall gets converted into summer season soil moisture the other variable is weeks to summer wts this is the time in the week from the end of winter to the week of summer in which forecasts are made 3 4 input data preparation and model training and testing strategy input information to machine learning models needs to be prepared in a certain quantitative and standard format these modifications to input data are the way to transfer human knowledge or understanding of the physical ecosystems processes to the model various kinds of input data modifications practices have been adopted and suggested rigorously by numerous studies to make ml ready training datasets for various purposes abidin et al 2020 alemohammad 2021 brownlee 2020 2022 frye and schmitt 2020 shetty et al 2021 the daily input time series were resampled to weekly average timesteps to remove any noise outlier in the data these data were then partitioned into two sets wintertime data i e observations during and before august and summertime data i e december to february because the study intend to forecast soil moisture three months ahead of time the study has not considered any data corresponding to september october and november which means the model relies on wintertime data to forecast summertime soil moisture finally the model was trained with wintertime observations corresponding to dynamic static and derived input explanatory variables as shown in table 2 to forecast summer season soil moisture awra l at root zone and deep soil 3 4 1 calculation of rainfall windows incorporating vegetation response in summer to wintertime rainfall into a machine learning ml model the study assumes that the summertime december to february ndvi could be a proxy of yearly accumulated biomass yab and can be predicted by cumulative wintertime rainfall this relationship between antecedent rainfall and ndvi has been studied in detail in joshi et al 2022 the vegetation response in summer to antecedent rainfall was calculated by fitting a simple linear relationship between summertime modis ndvi and cumulated rainfall prior to september corresponding to variable sized windows the window size in weeks that yielded the highest r2 with summertime ndvi was considered the optimal rainfall window that has maximum effect on the summertime vegetation growth ndvi has also been employed as an indicator of vegetation growth status by several past studies donohue et al 2009 donohue et al 2013 nemani et al 2003 tucker 1979 the accumulated rainfall corresponding to these variable sized windows along with modis multispectral thermal observations band 1 through 12 and lst day night other meteorological variables prior to september and site specific landscape attributes table 2 were used as an input to the integrated model to forecast the summer season december to february soil moisture awra l at root zone 0 1 m and deep 1 6 m however the optimal rainfall window for the base model was calculated by accumulating variable rainfall duration and checking its relationship with the output summer season awra l soil moisture the duration which yielded the highest r2 with the awra l soil moisture was considered the optimal window for that location finally as shown in table 2 the accumulated rainfall corresponding to these optimal windows meteorological variables prior to september and site specific landscape attributes were used to input the base model 3 4 2 model training and testing strategy two types of cross validation strategies were adopted to train and test the model by resampling training validating pixels with respect to space spatially constrained and time temporally constrained in temporally constrained strategy 30 percent of the years 6 out of 19 were randomly selected and were used to evaluate model performance while 70 percent of data 13 years were used to train the model similarly 500 iterations were executed and the results were evaluated for consistency in the spatially constrained strategy 30 percent of the study grid cells 648 out of 2160 grids were excluded and the remaining 70 percent 1512 grids were used to train the model this 70 30 cross validation process was repeated 500 times to check the consistency of the results spatially constrained strategy assesses the performance of the model in predicting soil moisture on the spatial location which was never used to train the model while temporally constrained strategy assesses the performance of model in predicting soil moisture in the temporal period which was not used to train the model 3 5 model configuration interpretation and evaluation 3 5 1 model configuration previous studies suggest that the hyperparameters provided with the lightgbm algorithm needs to be tuned for a specific dataset li et al 2018 luo 2016 yang and shami 2020 there are many hyperparameters but this study has considered tunning four of them the number of trees or estimators learning rate maximum tree depth and the regularization terms alpha and lambda this selection of hyperparameters was based on the experience that most studies have and in the official lightgbm document these parameters are advisable to hyper tune nayak et al 2021 a grid search was executed to select the optimal value for these four hyperparameters based on the highest model s performance 3 5 2 model interpretation shap shapley additive explanations values of the input variables were analyzed and present for the lightgbm model shap values are an efficient method to understand which features significantly influence the output prediction and whether the influence is positive or negative shap is an extension of a shapley value in cooperative game theory as a method for calculating the contribution of each feature in machine learning lundberg and lee 2017 wen et al 2021 this chapter has used tree shap algorithm lundberg et al 2018 for calculating shap values as this is an efficient way of shap calculation for tree based models such as random forest and gradient boosting machines ayoub et al 2021 shap values are calculated by determining the difference between the predicted values with and without the addition of each feature i e the effect of adding each feature for all combinations and taking the average more details of shap and tree shap algorithm can be found in lundberg and lee 2017 and lundberg et al 2018 shap values served three purposes 1 to remove unnecessary input variables 2 to analyze input variable importance in forecasting soil moisture and 3 identify the input variables modis was able to remove and modis s importance as an input explanatory variable over the base model model without modis all the analysis model development training testing and evaluation was performed using the scikit learn library of python pedregosa et al 2011 along with lightgbm and shap packages 3 5 3 model evaluation the following four metrics were utilized to evaluate the model performance root mean square error rmse 1 rmse i n obs i for i 2 n nash sutcliffe efficiency metric nse was used to analyze how better the forecasts are compared to mean of the observed modelled awra l data nse is generally used to assess the strength of hydrological models nash and sutcliffe 1970 the values of nse nearer to 1 suggest a model with better predictive skills while values near to 0 and less suggests the predictions are worse than mean of the observed timeseries 2 nse 1 i 1 n obs i for i 2 i 1 n obs i obs 2 where obsi and fori are the observed modelled awra l and the forecasted value at a time step i n is the total number of time steps or the observations obs is the average of observed modelled awra l values from i 1 to n fig 4 shows the contingency metrics used to calculate probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and accuracy of forecasting hydrological extremes the study considers the soil moisture less than or equal to 10th percentile value and more than or equal to 90th percentile value as the extreme hydrological events 4 results 4 1 input feature significance fig 5 shows the shap scores of the input features corresponding to the base model and integrated model against two cross validations in forecasting root zone and deep soil moisture y axis shows the order of the input explanatory variable corresponding to its importance high to low in modelling output each dot in the chart corresponds to each instance of the input variable while the colour represents the value contribution to the forecasting skill of the input feature from low blue to high red the distribution of data across the x axis represents its impact on the model output i e negative lower or positive higher for example fig 5 a shows that wintertime rainfall is the most critical variable in forecasting summer soil moisture the higher the rainfall higher is its shap value so the higher the impact on the summer season soil moisture and vice versa the dominant control of wintertime rainfall on summertime soil moisture is observed across all cross validations and soil depths this is in accord with the notion that wintertime rainfall plays a vital role in the summer season available water to the vegetation in the asynchronous climates burgess 1995 viola et al 2008 also the importance of rainfall does not change with model training constraints which could suggest that rainfall significantly varies temporally and spatially and must be considered to forecast soil moisture at any depth with higher accuracy in other observations the time from winter end to the forecasted week in the summer weeks to summer wts was found important in forecasting root zone soil moisture while it was not found among top 10 important parameter in forecasting deep soil moisture across two cross validations this could suggest that moisture in root zone is significantly dynamic in time which could change in a matter of weeks in the absence of the inputs from modis in the base model the geographical coordinates latitude longitude soil texture parameters mainly cly ece slt pto soc nto phc bdw and awc and daily maximum air temperature tmax in antecedent winter were in the list of top 10 essential input features in forecasting summer season soil moisture at both depths fig 5a and 5c and cross validations however modis optical and thermal observations have replaced almost all soil texture parameters and became an essential explanatory variable in forecasting summer season deep and root zone soil moisture across two cross validations fig 5b and 5d in addition the geographical coordinates latitude and longitude were replaced by modis observations in predicting root zone 0 1 m soil moisture while their importance decreases in predicting deep soil moisture fig 5 b d wintertime maximum temperature still maintained its position in the top ten important input features list in the integrated model four of the multispectral reflectance bands of modis b1 b2 b3 b6 and b7 representing red nir blue and two swir bands along with daytime land surface temperature lst day were found to be an essential input explanatory variable in forecasting summer season deep soil moisture the red and nir regions are sensitive to chlorophyll and leaf canopy structure datt 1998 1999 sims and gamon 2002 zarco tejada et al 2019 the literature suggests forest canopy observations in these reflections have a lagged relationship with upper layer some upper centimeters soil moisture but a real time relationship with deep soil moisture chen et al 2014 jamali et al 2011 that is why the winters observations in these ranges red and nir might have indicated the wintertime deep soil moisture status which acted as the initial soil moisture condition and helped the model to forecast deep soil moisture status in summers while the last four bands mainly b7 b8 b9 b10 and b12 represent swir and visible region and nighttime land surface temperature lst night of modis were found important to forecast summer season root zone soil moisture these are the visible regions sensitive to chlorophyll and carotenoid and generally have a real time relationship with upper layer soil moisture again observations in these reflections might have proxied upper layer soil moisture during winter 4 2 soil moisture forecast accuracy and improvements by integrating modis fig 6 compares the forecast accuracy for the deep and root zone soil moisture of the base model and integrated model evaluated and presented with metrics r2 nse and rmse corresponding to the spatially and temporally constrained cross validations the scatter plot in fig 6 shows the actual awra l vs forecasted awra l soil moisture from the 500 iterations 500 random selections of training and testing datasets please refer to section 3 4 3 for more details while the evaluation metrics are the averages of these 500 iterations the results suggest that deep soil moisture forecast can be achieved with greater improvement in skill than the root zone soil moisture across all cross validations and models in comparison the trend in the forecast accuracy for deep and root zone soil moisture is opposite across the two cross validations and models deep soil moisture showed high forecast accuracy with the temporally constrained models while root zone soil moisture had high forecast accuracy with the spatially constrained models on other hand the scatter plot shown in figure s1 suggests that a significant improvement in the integrated model soil moisture prediction accuracy is incorporated by the novel rainfall accumulation method moreover it appears that the forecasting accuracy of deep soil moisture is significantly enhanced percentage improvement in rmse of 22 8 33 3 by integrating wintertime modis observations in the base model fig 6 and table 3 however comparatively less enhancement in the forecast accuracy of root zone soil moisture percentage improvement in rmse of 8 8 14 3 is observed the reason could be that the forest growth in the asynchronous climate like victoria is driven by long term antecedent rainfall recharges deep moisture stores as suggested by joshi et al 2022 and others eamus et al 2002 hutley et al 2011 laclau et al 2013 therefore including summertime vegetation response to the wintertime or prior rainfall in the model might have included the soil moisture stores information resulting in the enhanced forecast notably the r2 score shown in fig 6 suggests that 81 88 of variability in summer season deep soil moisture and 55 65 in the summer season root zone soil moisture can be explained at the end of winter which allows 3 6 months of lead time in the asynchronous climate 4 3 evaluation of the base model and integrated model skill in forecasting hydrological extremes and inter comparison fig 7 and fig 8 show the contingency metrics constructed for evaluating the base model and integrated model capability to forecast hydrological extremes i e when soil moisture goes down to the 10th percentile extremely dry scenarios or exceeds the 90th percentile extremely wet scenarios respectively broadly three major observations can be made from the results first the model performed slightly better in forecasting extremely wetter scenarios compared to the extremely dry scenario though the difference is not large secondly spatially constrained models performed better in forecasting extreme hydrological scenarios than the temporally constrained models and third integration of modis into the integrated model has improved base model skill in forecasting hydrological extremes though the improvements are more pronounced in the temporally constrained models the probability of detection pod of extremely dry scenarios in deep soil has improved from 0 33 to 0 49 with a 0 66 to 0 51 improvement in false alarm ratio far upon integration of modis to the integrated model for spatially constrained cross validation at the same time improvements were 0 07 to 0 24 in pod and 0 84 to 0 44 in far for temporally constrained validation in comparison slight or no improvements were observed in pod and far of extremely dry scenarios in root zone soil for both cross validations on the other hand the observed improvements in the pod and far of extremely wetter scenarios in deep soil were 0 41 to 0 55 and 0 54 to 0 48 respectively for spatially constrained cross validation while the relatively more improved pod 0 15 0 36 far 0 72 to 0 46 were observed for temporally constrained cross validation again slight or no improvement was noticed in pod and far of extremely wetter scenarios in root zone soil for both cross validations 5 discussion this study has explored the possibility of developing an integrated machine learning based seasonal soil moisture forecast model founded on the mediterranean climate links between long antecedent rainfall inputs available moisture and vegetation response this method of employing winter observations to forecast summer season soil moisture exploits the connection of plants and geomorphological adaptations in the mediterranean regions where stored winter rainwater is required to meet plant needs in the summer pumo et al 2008 rodriguez iturbe et al 2001 viola et al 2008 we hypothesized that including the remotely sensed plant response to the antecedent rainfall would improve the model accuracy to forecast soil moisture because it might accommodate rainfall inputs landscape storing capacity and plant available moisture relationship that existing modelling systems lack arheimer et al 2020 arnal et al 2018 donnelly et al 2016 emerton et al 2018 results showed that antecedent seasonal wintertime and prior rainfall is the most critical predictor of peak growing season soil moisture in se australia s forested landscape the question of how skillful is the antecedent wintertime rainfall in forecasting summertime soil moisture content was tested using two methods firstly the time duration window calibration through the machine learning model itself as used in the base model and secondly through the novel method of summertime plant response to the wintertime rainfall as used in the integrated model both techniques have put rainfall at the top of the ten most important predictors list as shown in fig 6 however the later approach enhanced the soil moisture forecast accuracy suggesting additional forecast skills introduced by remotely sensed optical and thermal infrared imagery multispectral reflectance and lst from modis replaced many site specific landscape attributes in the top 10 most critical predictors when they were introduced to determine the integrated model fig 5 this might suggest that remotely sensed vegetation response to the climate forcing can be a surrogate for site specific landscape attribute like soil properties which are impractical to measure in high spatial resolution in forested landscapes hahm et al 2020 smith et al 2001 furthermore enhancement in the soil prediction accuracy in the integrated model compared to the base model suggests that long term modis observations better represent soil properties than the modelled or extrapolated soil layer the output accuracy of the physically based hydrological models could be enhanced by assimilating remotely sensed observations these could overcome the data paucity issues with the current modelling methods mainly with site specific geomorphology our results align with the numerous studies that have reported the enhancements in the output results by assimilation of one or other forms of remotely sensed observations especially over the forested landscape khaki et al 2018 khaki and awange 2019 the satellite based sensors like modis provide data at a relatively higher spatial and temporal resolution of 500 m to 1000 m daily which is preferable for several applications in the hydrology kornelsen and coulibaly 2013 and is a constraint with the current available global models arheimer et al 2020 arnal et al 2018 donnelly et al 2016 emerton et al 2018 with geographic coordinates latitude and longitude the climatic conditions change and consequently the vegetation composition and its functioning andersen et al 2011 bowman 1996 results showed that wintertime modis observations have replaced latitude and longitude from the list of top 10 essential features in forecasting root zone soil moisture fig 5 b d suggesting that modis can surrogate location specific variations in climatic conditions and vegetation feedbacks to root zone soil moisture while the persistent existence of longitude in the top 10 important feature list in forecasting deep soil moisture fig 5 b d suggests a significant variation in deep soil moisture across longitude in se australia which modis was unable to capture fig 6 showed that deep soil moisture has high forecast accuracy with the temporally constrained models while root zone soil moisture had high forecast accuracy with the spatially constrained models these two opposite trends suggest that root zone soil moisture exhibits high interannual variability and low spatial variability thus it could be contended that the entire temporal span is essential rather than entire spatial observations for a much more accurate forecast in the case of root zone soil moisture in comparison deep soil moisture exhibits low interannual variability but high spatial variability and the reason for high spatial variability could be dynamic soil moisture stores across the landscape these results suggest that forecasts at the unknown locations can be made more accurately for the root zone than deep layer soil moisture by machine learning models in contrast a forecast at an unknown time year can be made more accurately in deeper soil than the root zone soil as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 relatively higher pod and lower far in forecasting hydrological extremes with spatially constraint models suggest that complete temporal events as inputs provide the model with more opportunity to learn to forecast extreme soil moisture events while higher skills to forecast wetter scenarios than the drier scenario suggest that extremely wet winters are most likely able to maintain extremely higher soil moisture in the summer season in contrast soil moisture forecast in summer with antecedent drier winters could be influenced by rainfall status in the middle spring months september to november the study s result is interesting in that the 80 variability in deep and 50 variability in root zone summer season soil moisture can be forecast at the end of the antecedent winter fig 6 it is consistent with the intuitive observations of fire management people that the scene is set for big fire years in autumn the year before abram et al 2021 lucas et al 2007 this is relevant as se australia experiences a mediterranean climate where winter is cold and wet while summers are warm and dry in the winter and spring seasons rain allows for building fuel growth while the warm and dry conditions in the summer allow to build up the fire danger lucas et al 2007 similarly studies showed that the condition for the recent big fire season of 2019 20 was started building up much earlier in the year abram et al 2021 the current way of forecasting soil moisture has exploited the potential of input explanatory parameters until winter only however the low forecasting skills of summertime root zone soil moisture as compared to deep soil moisture might suggest that integrating springtime september to november rainfall could further enhance the forecast accuracy this could be achieved by integrating the seasonal rainfall forecast from sources like the australian bureau of meteorology s seasonal prediction system bom access s1 hudson et al 2017 2020 the next significant improvement to the model could be integrating ocean atmosphere teleconnections el nino southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod and southern annular mode sam as per the climate change models severely dry and warm seasons could frequently occur ahead evans et al 2017 herold et al 2018 therefore integrating these will leverage the model s capability to forecast hydrological extremes more accurately than the current model 6 conclusions 80 of the variability in 1 6 m and 50 of the variability in 0 1 m of summer season soil moisture can be forecast from rainfall until the end of winter remotely sensed vegetation response and site specific landscape attributes in se australia integrating remotely sensed observations of vegetation growth response to growth drivers has improved the soil moisture forecast accuracy with an enhancement in rmse for deep 1 6 m by 22 8 33 3 and for root zone 0 1 m by 8 8 14 3 also a significant improvement in forecasting hydrological extremes were observed long term remotely sensed observations over forested landscape could relatively better represent site specific landscape attributes evident from its top rank in feature importance list acquired by pushing out soil properties and landscape attributes in predicting soil moisture a computationally light model can be operationalized for se australia to forecast soil moisture 3 months ahead on forested landscape by integrating machine learning with remotely sensed observation rainfall and minimal site specific landscape attributes credit authorship contribution statement rakesh chandra joshi conceptualization methodology

corresponding author this manuscript was handled by emmanouil anagnostou editor in chief seasonal forecast of soil moisture at large spatial scale over forested landscape has numerous implications in forest hydrology and bushfire risk planning remotely sensed plant response to rainfall input meteorological forcing and site specific landscape attributes were integrated into a data driven gradient boosting machine learning ml model to forecast summer season december to february soil moisture equivalent to those from australian water resource assessment landscape awra l at root zone 0 1 m and deep 1 6 m layers of the soil multispectral and thermal infrared bands from modis band 1 12 lst day night and meteorological forcing for 2000 2018 during and prior to winter before august and site specific landscape attributes were used to generate the explanatory input variables to the model spatial and temporal forecasting skills of the model were evaluated using two types of cross validation two fold cross validation by space over the entire period 2000 2018 and two fold cross validation by time for all grid cells 2160 cells in the first method the model showed a high skill to forecast deep soil moisture r2 0 81 nse 0 79 rmse 58 01 mm and root zone soil moisture r2 0 65 nse 0 63 rmse 24 34 mm in comparison the second evaluation resulted in more accurate forecast deep soil moisture r2 0 88 nse 0 86 rmse 47 39 mm but in lower performance for root zone soil r2 0 55 nse 0 47 rmse 29 2 mm these outcomes have highlighted that the 80 variability in summers deep 1 6 m soil moisture and 50 variability in root zone 0 1 m soil moisture over forested landscape can be explained at the end of winters furthermore integrating remotely sensed observations has improved the results by showing an enhancement in the rmse by 22 8 33 3 in the deep 1 6 m soil moisture and 8 8 14 3 in root zone 0 1 m soil moisture overall the integrated system using remotely sensed plant response climate forcing and machine learning exhibit great potential to forecast summer soil moisture three months ahead in the mediterranean climates keywords asynchronous climate soil moisture forecast seasonal soil moisture machine learning lightgbm modis temperate forests awra l data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction seasonal 3 months ahead forecast of soil moisture across a large spatial extent is valuable for timely management actions required to enhance forest productivity and health it can also improve early prediction of processes linked to soil moisture such as carbon cycle modelling flood and drought vegetation water stress fuel moisture and streamflow an a priori knowledge of the probability of low soil moisture is of particular interest to stakeholders because low soil moisture is correlated with high fire danger drought and low streamflow these factors significantly impact the australian socio economy a prime example being regular large fire events that threaten human life agriculture and forest ecosystems allen et al 2010 fensham et al 2009 dry periods drive low streamflow increased threats to water availability khaledi et al 2022 water security is strongly linked to forest moisture status as forested catchments are a significant source of drinking water into most australian states bates et al 2008 recent projections of climate change models indicate more frequent occurrence of dry conditions in the coming decade bates et al 2008 booth et al 2015 dey et al 2019 evans et al 2017 herold et al 2018 to our best knowledge there is no operational seasonal soil moisture forecast system exists for australia although hydrological forecasting systems exist at global or continental scale including glofas e hype efas and ww hype arheimer et al 2020 arnal et al 2018 donnelly et al 2016 emerton et al 2018 vogel et al 2021 it is essential to note that global systems are not necessarily transferrable regionally because they may not realize regional climate and hydrological characteristics due to the spatial heterogeneity in climatic situations and land surface properties such as topography vegetation and soil texture hence a seasonal soil moisture forecast system developed and tested for australia is required seasonal soil moisture forecasts at the global scale are currently produced by coupling climate forecast models with hydrological models in this method process based hydrological models are forced with the climate forecasts generated through seasonal climate forecasting models arnal et al 2018 emerton et al 2018 however the operational implementation of these methods models are challenging as they are computationally expensive and require a considerable amount of data and resources to maintain the system arnal et al 2018 emerton et al 2018 also the input forcing data to climate and hydrological models are from sparsely located weather stations studies show that the spatial distribution and precision of rainfall measurements considerably influence the accuracy of the modelled soil moisture shen et al 2012 sun et al 2002 yin et al 2018 in addition landscape water storing capacity on which hydrological models rely on is inaccurate because it is impractical to measure them especially in upland forests affecting models output accuracy furthermore these models produce output at a coarse spatial resolution such as glofas 0 1 deg e hype ww hype and era 5 1000 km2 which may be too coarse for some applications like bushfire risk planning and streamflow predictions vogel et al 2021 studies suggest the need for soil moisture at high spatial resolution is rapidly increasing for many applications in hydrology agriculture and climatology kornelsen and coulibaly 2013 further the existing seasonal soil moisture forecast systems methods were primarily developed in and concentrated in europe and the us esit et al 2021 sehgal and sridhar 2019 these approaches may not always be transferrable to the australian context although some studies have attempted soil moisture forecast regionally they were limited to short term forecasts 7 days or limited to a few centimeters of soil further most of them were tested over agricultural fields because food security has been seen as more important than forest ecosystem conservation and knowing soil moisture dynamics in the upper few centimeters is adequate for many agricultural purposes however for long range forest health wildfire risk planning seven days forecast or even one month in advance is not sufficient in fact mediterranean forests depend on deep soil moisture during extensive dry seasons so knowing soil moisture only in 1 100 cm soil depth will not make much sense if the intention is to predict forest health wildfire risk and or streamflow these existing gaps can be addressed by developing a computationally light regional model using observed data at a large spatio temporal scale which can forecast soil moisture at different soil depths over the forested regions in better than existing 10 km spatial resolution there has been growing use of machine learning ml models due to their outstanding capability to extract features in historical data without requiring the knowledge of underlying processes lary et al 2016 these methods have been widely used to identify the linear or non linear relationship between predictor and predictand fahimi et al 2017 rhee and im 2017 the ml models can learn data patterns and produce predictions without a pre defined structure of the existing association between the input parameters alavi et al 2010 lantz 2019 sachindra and kanae 2019 although there is a general perception that ml approaches require extensive data for training a study by karandish and šimůnek 2016 showed that ml might provide a useful alternative to physical based models using limited input data which suggests that a computationally light model can be developed using ml methods more recently gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and deep learning dl approaches have attracted interests of modelers and data scientists due to their efficient learning capabilities especially for the time series problems out of many ml approaches the lightgbm ke et al 2017 and long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 are widely used for various applications moreover ml methods have demonstrated acceptable skills in forecasting hydro meteorological variables such asprecipitation barrera animas et al 2022 parmar et al 2017 drought khan et al 2020 rhee and im 2017 sundararajan et al 2021 streamflow feng et al 2020 ferreira et al 2021 rahimzad et al 2021 saraiva et al 2021 runoff kumar et al 2019 mohammadi 2021 flood mosavi et al 2018 water table depth zhang et al 2018 water demand de souza groppo et al 2019 and soil moisture fang et al 2019 fang and shen 2020 fang et al 2017 jiang and cotton 2004 orth 2021 senanayake et al 2021 zou et al 2010 in the last decade the application of ml has been broadly explored to predict retrieve soil moisture mostly over agricultural areas adab et al 2020 cai et al 2019 carranza et al 2021 dubois et al 2021 hong et al 2016 karandish and šimůnek 2016 karthikeyan and mishra 2021 matei et al 2017 with fewer studies on forests de oliveira et al 2021 senanayake et al 2021 the scarcity of in situ data in forested landscape and potential of satellite observations to include repeatedly obtained spatio temporal data has led to the extensive use of the ml approaches integrated with optical and thermal data from the satellite sensors particularly modis landsat and noaa avhrr to forecast predict or retrieve surface soil moisture over the forests along with other relevant variables adab et al 2020 ahmad et al 2010 korres et al 2015 petropoulos et al 2015 senanayake et al 2021 wang and qu 2009 however most of the studies have focused on real time soil moisture estimation adab et al 2020 ahmad et al 2010 fang et al 2017 jiang and cotton 2004 senanayake et al 2021 with only a few of them focusing on the long term soil moisture forecasting duan and kumar 2020 esit et al 2021 fang et al 2019 sehgal and sridhar 2019 this paper explores an ml based method for seasonal soil moisture forecast with a 3 month lead time at two different soil depths root zone 0 1 m and deep soil 1 6 m over forest regions in victoria in se australia previous work joshi et al 2022 found that in mediterranean regions like southeast australia plants primarily depend on the stored water from long past rainfall inputs therefore their location specific response to antecedent rainfall could relate to the landscape water storing capacity building on this understanding the present study has explored the integration of this mechanistic knowledge from joshi et al 2022 with remotely sensed forest observations meteorological data and landscape attributes like soil properties topography and some derived attributes to forecast summer season soil moisture at the end of the antecedent winter further this idea can be supported by the studies that suggest that plant optical thermal response to climate forcing could provide insights into groundwater storage capacity especially in the mediterranean regions dralle et al 2020 esit et al 2021 kundu et al 2017 li et al 2016 poméon et al 2018 yassin et al 2017 the study hypothesizes that integrating machine learning methods and continuously observed remotely sensed plant response to climate forcing will enhance the retrieval of the long range relationship between climate forcing and soil moisture accordingly incorporating modis into the machine learning methods will improve the skill for seasonal soil moisture forecast compared to the base model i e ml model without remotely sensed plant response to the climate forcing these two models were developed and compared for their capability to forecast seasonal soil moisture in this study due to scarcity of available observed soil moisture data at a large spatial scale the modelled soil moisture from awra l has been used as a pseudo ground truth for this study 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area encompasses the eucalypt forest region in victoria southeastern australia there are 23 forest types in victoria according to the vegetation spatial layer created by the agriculture department of the government of victoria and 11 bioregions as classified by the interim biogeographic regionalization for australia ibra7 these geographically distinctive bioregions are founded on shared climate geology landform and native vegetation the 11 bioregions are further divided into 30 subregions which are more localized and homogenous geomorphological units in each bioregion the annual rainfall and mean temperature range from 400 mm 20 c in western parts to 1500 mm 5 c in eastern parts of the state bom 2010 according to köppen geiger classification the victoria is classified as csb temperate dry summer warm summer cfa temperate no dry season hot summer cfb temperate no dry season warm summer and bsk arid steppe cold peel et al 2007 the vegetation growth drivers of rainfall and temperature are asynchronous in these regions as they are in the mediterranean climate classified under csa temperate dry summer hot summer and csb temperate dry summer warm summer by köppen geiger the regions of interest located in victoria have been sampled into 2160 grid cells of 0 05 x 0 05 lying over forest patches as shown in fig 1 the vegetation layer from national vegetation information system nvis australia version 6 0 has been used to identify these forest patches these data are available at the spatial resolution of 100 m nvis technical working group 2017 selection of the sampling grid cell size of 0 05 x 0 05 is determined 1 to remove the artifacts caused by the spatial discrepancy between modis optical available at 500 m and 1000 m and modis lst available at 1000 m 2 to make spatial resolution comparable as the modeled soil moisture data from awra l along with other meteorological and site specific data used in this study such as rainfall air temperature and vapor pressure deficit are available at 0 05 spatial resolution 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 modis multispectral and thermal infrared dataset modis mcd43a4 version 6 nadir bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf adjusted reflectance nbar for bands 1 to 7 and modis modocga version 6 level 2 for bands 8 through 12 schaaf 2015 from the year 2000 to 2018 were used in the study the mcd43a4 dataset is produced daily using a 16 day retrieval period with the images date on the 9th day the final dataset is available at a 500 m spatial resolution which combines data from terra and aqua considering the best pixel in 16 day period it contains reflectance bands 1 through 7 accompanied by a quality layer for each band while the modocga is an atmospheric corrected data for the conditions such as gasses aerosols and rayleigh scattering it is a daily land product with a pixel size of 1000 m and contains reflectance bands 8 through 16 along with a quality layer for each band for this study modis reflectance bands 1 through 12 were used as the remaining bands 13 to 16 were missing for significant number of dates the lst data were extracted from modis dataset myd11a1 006 which provides daily land surface temperature and emissivity with 1000 m spatial resolution wan 2015 it provides both daytime approximately 1 30 pm local time and nighttime approximately 1 30am local time values accompanied by a quality layer for each the description of each of the optical and thermal bands used in this study along with the wavelength range is given in table 1 the data for this study were accessed through the google earth engine gee platform gorelick et al 2017 the gee javascript code was used to mask the cloud pixels and the high quality pixels were extracted and saved in the comma separated files csv file which was used for further analysis 2 2 2 meteorological and modelled soil moisture the gridded meteorological datasets rainfall temperature vapour pressure deficit relative humidity and solar radiation at a spatial resolution of 0 05 x 0 05 were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology bom for a period of 19 years 2000 2018 the rainfall and temperature data are a part of bom s australian water availability project awap raupach et al 2009 awap provides the interpolated daily accumulated rainfall prior to 9 am local time minimum and maximum temperature values observed from the automatic weather station aws at 0 05 x 0 05 resolution jones et al 2009 numerous studies have used gridded rainfall and temperature products and the quality of the product is under the acceptable error limits for hydrological modelling chubb et al 2016 awra l s soil moisture outputs at root zone 0 1 m and deep 1 6 m hereafter root zone and deep soil was used as a reference data representing soil moisture dynamics awra l australian water resource assessment landscape is a landscape model developed by bom and commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization csiro and the model runs on a daily timestep and simulates the landscape water balance for australia from 1911 to present van dijk and warren 2010 the modelled soil moisture by awra l is the only soil moisture available at relatively high resolution over the australian continent and is validated for the several catchments in the victorian forest 2 2 3 site specific landscape attributes three categories of parameters were included in the model spatial location latitude longitude soil properties and elevation the soil attributes were obtained from a recent project called soil and landscape grid of australia slga https www clw csiro au aclep soilandlandscapegrid accessed on 25 october 2021 this dataset is the first continental version of the globalsoilmap idea containing a fine spatial resolution set of continuous soil characteristics with australia wide coverage it incorporates historical soil data new measurements with spectroscopic sensors and novel spatial modelling to generate national digital maps of soil features at 3 arcsec spatial resolution grundy et al 2015 viscarra rossel et al 2014 eleven soil attributes as shown in table 2 are available at each pixel accompanied by the confidence intervals for each estimate to a depth of 2 m or less the elevation data was obtained from the globally available shuttle radar topographic mission srtm at 30 m spatial resolution matching to the spatial resolution of awra l 0 05 x 0 05 all other input variables were averaged to this spatial resolution and then the dynamic time series observations were resampled to weekly timestamp by taking average of across seven days 3 methodology 3 1 modeling concept connection between wintertime rain and summertime soil moisture in asynchronous climate in asynchronous climate the vegetation in the extended dry periods mainly the deep rooted plants depends on the rainfall inputs from past wet events the present study has integrated this understanding of the rainfall landscape water storing capacity and plant available moisture relationship into the model via the plant s response in the summer season december january and february hereafter summertime to the rainfall in winter season august and before hereafter wintertime which on average represents 80 of annual rain two models hereafter called base model and integrated model as elaborated in fig 2 were developed to analyze and compare the significance of including mechanistic empirical knowledge of wintertime rain relationship to summertime soil moisture in forecasting summertime soil moisture a novel technique as described in 3 4 1 was explored to back calculate the size of the location specific wintertime rainfall time period hereafter termed rainfall windows to which vegetation responds in the summertime fig 3 along with other inputs as described in table 2 the accumulated rain corresponding to these rainfall windows was used as input to a machine learning ml model to forecast soil moisture three months ahead of time fig 3 that is represented as the integrated model while for comparison a base model was developed which uses all the input variables as in the integrated model except remotely sensed observations as shown in fig 2 the rainfall window size for the base model was calculated by the model itself described in detail in section 3 4 1 due to non existence of observed data at continental scale modelled awra l root zone and deep soil moisture is used as the truth dataset i e a proxy for actual soil moisture observations 3 2 machine learning ml model this study tested an ensemble gradient boosting method called lightgbm ke et al 2017 this approach efficiently implements the stochastic gradient boosting ensemble algorithms it extends gradient boosting by adding an automatic feature selection and is more focused on boosting with more significant gradients furthermore this algorithm adds two critical ideas to gradient boosting gradient based one side sampling goss and exclusive feature bundling efb these additional features accelerate the training time of the algorithm up to 20 times faster than the original gradient boosting algorithm while achieving almost the same accuracy ke et al 2017 also the outputs from these gradient boosting models are relatively more interpretable than the deep learning models for example each input variable s importance in predicting the output can be computed for the gradient boosting models to decide whether to keep or remove that input variable contributions of individual input variables to output predictions in the gradient boosting models are evaluated using the multi dimensional metric like shap shapley additive explanations more details of lightgbm can be found in ke et al 2017 3 3 choice and rationale of the input explanatory variables to the ml model feature selection the input explanatory variables to the ml model are categorized into three groups dynamic site specific and derived inputs as shown in table 2 the dynamic category includes historical time series observations and the site specific landscape attributes representing geomorphological characteristics which are considered constant for geolocation in contrast the derived category includes the specific property extracted from the long term historical time series weather observations for geolocation all these input time series variables were resampled by taking the mean value to match the spatial resolution of output awra l 0 05 the rationale behind choosing these input variables is presented in the following section 3 3 1 dynamic input variables air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity studies show that air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity has significant control on the evapotranspiration thus plays a significant role in soil water balance lofgren et al 2011 rahimikhoob 2010 zanetti et al 2007 rainfall this is the primary input climatic forcing that decides the amount of water input to the system wintertime rain was cumulated employing different methods for the base model and integrated model described in section 3 4 1 remotely sensed optical and thermal response of the plant to soil moisture the study assumed that the optical reflection through the forest canopy could link to the long term soil moisture condition as forests in these asynchronous climates depend on deep soil moisture optical reflection could indicate the long term moisture conditions numerous studies have used modis multispectral and thermal observations in one or more aspects of hydrological modelling and linking to transpiration status bohn and vivoni 2019 hwang et al 2008 ruhoff et al 2013 wang et al 2009 3 3 2 static landscape attributes elevation elevation could be a significant explanatory variable considering its effects on rainfall javari 2017 song et al 2019 temperature heynen et al 2016 kattel and yao 2018 phan et al 2018 vegetation functioning geng et al 2019 veen et al 2017 and soil depth amundson et al 2015 soil properties soil composition parameters determine the water holding capacity that controls overall soil moisture content and these could act as an important input explanatory variable to the machine learning model baroni et al 2013 huang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 geographical coordinates machine learning based approaches found a significant correlation and importance of geographical coordinates latitude longitude in predicting soil moisture at various depths de oliveira et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 this is likely the result of systematic variation of weather climate conditions with location particularly their meridional gradient based on these observations this study has considered location information an input explanatory variable to the model 3 3 3 derived input parameters some of the input parameters for the models were extracted using the long term 1911 2000 time series data the motivation for using these parameters is to distinguish the site characteristics based on the climate and location specific land processes these include the long term mean annual temperature and precipitation and the long term ratio of wintertime rainfall to summer season soil moisture for each 2160 study sampling windows this long term ratio could be significant in relating to the geomorphological conditions based on how much wintertime rainfall gets converted into summer season soil moisture the other variable is weeks to summer wts this is the time in the week from the end of winter to the week of summer in which forecasts are made 3 4 input data preparation and model training and testing strategy input information to machine learning models needs to be prepared in a certain quantitative and standard format these modifications to input data are the way to transfer human knowledge or understanding of the physical ecosystems processes to the model various kinds of input data modifications practices have been adopted and suggested rigorously by numerous studies to make ml ready training datasets for various purposes abidin et al 2020 alemohammad 2021 brownlee 2020 2022 frye and schmitt 2020 shetty et al 2021 the daily input time series were resampled to weekly average timesteps to remove any noise outlier in the data these data were then partitioned into two sets wintertime data i e observations during and before august and summertime data i e december to february because the study intend to forecast soil moisture three months ahead of time the study has not considered any data corresponding to september october and november which means the model relies on wintertime data to forecast summertime soil moisture finally the model was trained with wintertime observations corresponding to dynamic static and derived input explanatory variables as shown in table 2 to forecast summer season soil moisture awra l at root zone and deep soil 3 4 1 calculation of rainfall windows incorporating vegetation response in summer to wintertime rainfall into a machine learning ml model the study assumes that the summertime december to february ndvi could be a proxy of yearly accumulated biomass yab and can be predicted by cumulative wintertime rainfall this relationship between antecedent rainfall and ndvi has been studied in detail in joshi et al 2022 the vegetation response in summer to antecedent rainfall was calculated by fitting a simple linear relationship between summertime modis ndvi and cumulated rainfall prior to september corresponding to variable sized windows the window size in weeks that yielded the highest r2 with summertime ndvi was considered the optimal rainfall window that has maximum effect on the summertime vegetation growth ndvi has also been employed as an indicator of vegetation growth status by several past studies donohue et al 2009 donohue et al 2013 nemani et al 2003 tucker 1979 the accumulated rainfall corresponding to these variable sized windows along with modis multispectral thermal observations band 1 through 12 and lst day night other meteorological variables prior to september and site specific landscape attributes table 2 were used as an input to the integrated model to forecast the summer season december to february soil moisture awra l at root zone 0 1 m and deep 1 6 m however the optimal rainfall window for the base model was calculated by accumulating variable rainfall duration and checking its relationship with the output summer season awra l soil moisture the duration which yielded the highest r2 with the awra l soil moisture was considered the optimal window for that location finally as shown in table 2 the accumulated rainfall corresponding to these optimal windows meteorological variables prior to september and site specific landscape attributes were used to input the base model 3 4 2 model training and testing strategy two types of cross validation strategies were adopted to train and test the model by resampling training validating pixels with respect to space spatially constrained and time temporally constrained in temporally constrained strategy 30 percent of the years 6 out of 19 were randomly selected and were used to evaluate model performance while 70 percent of data 13 years were used to train the model similarly 500 iterations were executed and the results were evaluated for consistency in the spatially constrained strategy 30 percent of the study grid cells 648 out of 2160 grids were excluded and the remaining 70 percent 1512 grids were used to train the model this 70 30 cross validation process was repeated 500 times to check the consistency of the results spatially constrained strategy assesses the performance of the model in predicting soil moisture on the spatial location which was never used to train the model while temporally constrained strategy assesses the performance of model in predicting soil moisture in the temporal period which was not used to train the model 3 5 model configuration interpretation and evaluation 3 5 1 model configuration previous studies suggest that the hyperparameters provided with the lightgbm algorithm needs to be tuned for a specific dataset li et al 2018 luo 2016 yang and shami 2020 there are many hyperparameters but this study has considered tunning four of them the number of trees or estimators learning rate maximum tree depth and the regularization terms alpha and lambda this selection of hyperparameters was based on the experience that most studies have and in the official lightgbm document these parameters are advisable to hyper tune nayak et al 2021 a grid search was executed to select the optimal value for these four hyperparameters based on the highest model s performance 3 5 2 model interpretation shap shapley additive explanations values of the input variables were analyzed and present for the lightgbm model shap values are an efficient method to understand which features significantly influence the output prediction and whether the influence is positive or negative shap is an extension of a shapley value in cooperative game theory as a method for calculating the contribution of each feature in machine learning lundberg and lee 2017 wen et al 2021 this chapter has used tree shap algorithm lundberg et al 2018 for calculating shap values as this is an efficient way of shap calculation for tree based models such as random forest and gradient boosting machines ayoub et al 2021 shap values are calculated by determining the difference between the predicted values with and without the addition of each feature i e the effect of adding each feature for all combinations and taking the average more details of shap and tree shap algorithm can be found in lundberg and lee 2017 and lundberg et al 2018 shap values served three purposes 1 to remove unnecessary input variables 2 to analyze input variable importance in forecasting soil moisture and 3 identify the input variables modis was able to remove and modis s importance as an input explanatory variable over the base model model without modis all the analysis model development training testing and evaluation was performed using the scikit learn library of python pedregosa et al 2011 along with lightgbm and shap packages 3 5 3 model evaluation the following four metrics were utilized to evaluate the model performance root mean square error rmse 1 rmse i n obs i for i 2 n nash sutcliffe efficiency metric nse was used to analyze how better the forecasts are compared to mean of the observed modelled awra l data nse is generally used to assess the strength of hydrological models nash and sutcliffe 1970 the values of nse nearer to 1 suggest a model with better predictive skills while values near to 0 and less suggests the predictions are worse than mean of the observed timeseries 2 nse 1 i 1 n obs i for i 2 i 1 n obs i obs 2 where obsi and fori are the observed modelled awra l and the forecasted value at a time step i n is the total number of time steps or the observations obs is the average of observed modelled awra l values from i 1 to n fig 4 shows the contingency metrics used to calculate probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and accuracy of forecasting hydrological extremes the study considers the soil moisture less than or equal to 10th percentile value and more than or equal to 90th percentile value as the extreme hydrological events 4 results 4 1 input feature significance fig 5 shows the shap scores of the input features corresponding to the base model and integrated model against two cross validations in forecasting root zone and deep soil moisture y axis shows the order of the input explanatory variable corresponding to its importance high to low in modelling output each dot in the chart corresponds to each instance of the input variable while the colour represents the value contribution to the forecasting skill of the input feature from low blue to high red the distribution of data across the x axis represents its impact on the model output i e negative lower or positive higher for example fig 5 a shows that wintertime rainfall is the most critical variable in forecasting summer soil moisture the higher the rainfall higher is its shap value so the higher the impact on the summer season soil moisture and vice versa the dominant control of wintertime rainfall on summertime soil moisture is observed across all cross validations and soil depths this is in accord with the notion that wintertime rainfall plays a vital role in the summer season available water to the vegetation in the asynchronous climates burgess 1995 viola et al 2008 also the importance of rainfall does not change with model training constraints which could suggest that rainfall significantly varies temporally and spatially and must be considered to forecast soil moisture at any depth with higher accuracy in other observations the time from winter end to the forecasted week in the summer weeks to summer wts was found important in forecasting root zone soil moisture while it was not found among top 10 important parameter in forecasting deep soil moisture across two cross validations this could suggest that moisture in root zone is significantly dynamic in time which could change in a matter of weeks in the absence of the inputs from modis in the base model the geographical coordinates latitude longitude soil texture parameters mainly cly ece slt pto soc nto phc bdw and awc and daily maximum air temperature tmax in antecedent winter were in the list of top 10 essential input features in forecasting summer season soil moisture at both depths fig 5a and 5c and cross validations however modis optical and thermal observations have replaced almost all soil texture parameters and became an essential explanatory variable in forecasting summer season deep and root zone soil moisture across two cross validations fig 5b and 5d in addition the geographical coordinates latitude and longitude were replaced by modis observations in predicting root zone 0 1 m soil moisture while their importance decreases in predicting deep soil moisture fig 5 b d wintertime maximum temperature still maintained its position in the top ten important input features list in the integrated model four of the multispectral reflectance bands of modis b1 b2 b3 b6 and b7 representing red nir blue and two swir bands along with daytime land surface temperature lst day were found to be an essential input explanatory variable in forecasting summer season deep soil moisture the red and nir regions are sensitive to chlorophyll and leaf canopy structure datt 1998 1999 sims and gamon 2002 zarco tejada et al 2019 the literature suggests forest canopy observations in these reflections have a lagged relationship with upper layer some upper centimeters soil moisture but a real time relationship with deep soil moisture chen et al 2014 jamali et al 2011 that is why the winters observations in these ranges red and nir might have indicated the wintertime deep soil moisture status which acted as the initial soil moisture condition and helped the model to forecast deep soil moisture status in summers while the last four bands mainly b7 b8 b9 b10 and b12 represent swir and visible region and nighttime land surface temperature lst night of modis were found important to forecast summer season root zone soil moisture these are the visible regions sensitive to chlorophyll and carotenoid and generally have a real time relationship with upper layer soil moisture again observations in these reflections might have proxied upper layer soil moisture during winter 4 2 soil moisture forecast accuracy and improvements by integrating modis fig 6 compares the forecast accuracy for the deep and root zone soil moisture of the base model and integrated model evaluated and presented with metrics r2 nse and rmse corresponding to the spatially and temporally constrained cross validations the scatter plot in fig 6 shows the actual awra l vs forecasted awra l soil moisture from the 500 iterations 500 random selections of training and testing datasets please refer to section 3 4 3 for more details while the evaluation metrics are the averages of these 500 iterations the results suggest that deep soil moisture forecast can be achieved with greater improvement in skill than the root zone soil moisture across all cross validations and models in comparison the trend in the forecast accuracy for deep and root zone soil moisture is opposite across the two cross validations and models deep soil moisture showed high forecast accuracy with the temporally constrained models while root zone soil moisture had high forecast accuracy with the spatially constrained models on other hand the scatter plot shown in figure s1 suggests that a significant improvement in the integrated model soil moisture prediction accuracy is incorporated by the novel rainfall accumulation method moreover it appears that the forecasting accuracy of deep soil moisture is significantly enhanced percentage improvement in rmse of 22 8 33 3 by integrating wintertime modis observations in the base model fig 6 and table 3 however comparatively less enhancement in the forecast accuracy of root zone soil moisture percentage improvement in rmse of 8 8 14 3 is observed the reason could be that the forest growth in the asynchronous climate like victoria is driven by long term antecedent rainfall recharges deep moisture stores as suggested by joshi et al 2022 and others eamus et al 2002 hutley et al 2011 laclau et al 2013 therefore including summertime vegetation response to the wintertime or prior rainfall in the model might have included the soil moisture stores information resulting in the enhanced forecast notably the r2 score shown in fig 6 suggests that 81 88 of variability in summer season deep soil moisture and 55 65 in the summer season root zone soil moisture can be explained at the end of winter which allows 3 6 months of lead time in the asynchronous climate 4 3 evaluation of the base model and integrated model skill in forecasting hydrological extremes and inter comparison fig 7 and fig 8 show the contingency metrics constructed for evaluating the base model and integrated model capability to forecast hydrological extremes i e when soil moisture goes down to the 10th percentile extremely dry scenarios or exceeds the 90th percentile extremely wet scenarios respectively broadly three major observations can be made from the results first the model performed slightly better in forecasting extremely wetter scenarios compared to the extremely dry scenario though the difference is not large secondly spatially constrained models performed better in forecasting extreme hydrological scenarios than the temporally constrained models and third integration of modis into the integrated model has improved base model skill in forecasting hydrological extremes though the improvements are more pronounced in the temporally constrained models the probability of detection pod of extremely dry scenarios in deep soil has improved from 0 33 to 0 49 with a 0 66 to 0 51 improvement in false alarm ratio far upon integration of modis to the integrated model for spatially constrained cross validation at the same time improvements were 0 07 to 0 24 in pod and 0 84 to 0 44 in far for temporally constrained validation in comparison slight or no improvements were observed in pod and far of extremely dry scenarios in root zone soil for both cross validations on the other hand the observed improvements in the pod and far of extremely wetter scenarios in deep soil were 0 41 to 0 55 and 0 54 to 0 48 respectively for spatially constrained cross validation while the relatively more improved pod 0 15 0 36 far 0 72 to 0 46 were observed for temporally constrained cross validation again slight or no improvement was noticed in pod and far of extremely wetter scenarios in root zone soil for both cross validations 5 discussion this study has explored the possibility of developing an integrated machine learning based seasonal soil moisture forecast model founded on the mediterranean climate links between long antecedent rainfall inputs available moisture and vegetation response this method of employing winter observations to forecast summer season soil moisture exploits the connection of plants and geomorphological adaptations in the mediterranean regions where stored winter rainwater is required to meet plant needs in the summer pumo et al 2008 rodriguez iturbe et al 2001 viola et al 2008 we hypothesized that including the remotely sensed plant response to the antecedent rainfall would improve the model accuracy to forecast soil moisture because it might accommodate rainfall inputs landscape storing capacity and plant available moisture relationship that existing modelling systems lack arheimer et al 2020 arnal et al 2018 donnelly et al 2016 emerton et al 2018 results showed that antecedent seasonal wintertime and prior rainfall is the most critical predictor of peak growing season soil moisture in se australia s forested landscape the question of how skillful is the antecedent wintertime rainfall in forecasting summertime soil moisture content was tested using two methods firstly the time duration window calibration through the machine learning model itself as used in the base model and secondly through the novel method of summertime plant response to the wintertime rainfall as used in the integrated model both techniques have put rainfall at the top of the ten most important predictors list as shown in fig 6 however the later approach enhanced the soil moisture forecast accuracy suggesting additional forecast skills introduced by remotely sensed optical and thermal infrared imagery multispectral reflectance and lst from modis replaced many site specific landscape attributes in the top 10 most critical predictors when they were introduced to determine the integrated model fig 5 this might suggest that remotely sensed vegetation response to the climate forcing can be a surrogate for site specific landscape attribute like soil properties which are impractical to measure in high spatial resolution in forested landscapes hahm et al 2020 smith et al 2001 furthermore enhancement in the soil prediction accuracy in the integrated model compared to the base model suggests that long term modis observations better represent soil properties than the modelled or extrapolated soil layer the output accuracy of the physically based hydrological models could be enhanced by assimilating remotely sensed observations these could overcome the data paucity issues with the current modelling methods mainly with site specific geomorphology our results align with the numerous studies that have reported the enhancements in the output results by assimilation of one or other forms of remotely sensed observations especially over the forested landscape khaki et al 2018 khaki and awange 2019 the satellite based sensors like modis provide data at a relatively higher spatial and temporal resolution of 500 m to 1000 m daily which is preferable for several applications in the hydrology kornelsen and coulibaly 2013 and is a constraint with the current available global models arheimer et al 2020 arnal et al 2018 donnelly et al 2016 emerton et al 2018 with geographic coordinates latitude and longitude the climatic conditions change and consequently the vegetation composition and its functioning andersen et al 2011 bowman 1996 results showed that wintertime modis observations have replaced latitude and longitude from the list of top 10 essential features in forecasting root zone soil moisture fig 5 b d suggesting that modis can surrogate location specific variations in climatic conditions and vegetation feedbacks to root zone soil moisture while the persistent existence of longitude in the top 10 important feature list in forecasting deep soil moisture fig 5 b d suggests a significant variation in deep soil moisture across longitude in se australia which modis was unable to capture fig 6 showed that deep soil moisture has high forecast accuracy with the temporally constrained models while root zone soil moisture had high forecast accuracy with the spatially constrained models these two opposite trends suggest that root zone soil moisture exhibits high interannual variability and low spatial variability thus it could be contended that the entire temporal span is essential rather than entire spatial observations for a much more accurate forecast in the case of root zone soil moisture in comparison deep soil moisture exhibits low interannual variability but high spatial variability and the reason for high spatial variability could be dynamic soil moisture stores across the landscape these results suggest that forecasts at the unknown locations can be made more accurately for the root zone than deep layer soil moisture by machine learning models in contrast a forecast at an unknown time year can be made more accurately in deeper soil than the root zone soil as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 relatively higher pod and lower far in forecasting hydrological extremes with spatially constraint models suggest that complete temporal events as inputs provide the model with more opportunity to learn to forecast extreme soil moisture events while higher skills to forecast wetter scenarios than the drier scenario suggest that extremely wet winters are most likely able to maintain extremely higher soil moisture in the summer season in contrast soil moisture forecast in summer with antecedent drier winters could be influenced by rainfall status in the middle spring months september to november the study s result is interesting in that the 80 variability in deep and 50 variability in root zone summer season soil moisture can be forecast at the end of the antecedent winter fig 6 it is consistent with the intuitive observations of fire management people that the scene is set for big fire years in autumn the year before abram et al 2021 lucas et al 2007 this is relevant as se australia experiences a mediterranean climate where winter is cold and wet while summers are warm and dry in the winter and spring seasons rain allows for building fuel growth while the warm and dry conditions in the summer allow to build up the fire danger lucas et al 2007 similarly studies showed that the condition for the recent big fire season of 2019 20 was started building up much earlier in the year abram et al 2021 the current way of forecasting soil moisture has exploited the potential of input explanatory parameters until winter only however the low forecasting skills of summertime root zone soil moisture as compared to deep soil moisture might suggest that integrating springtime september to november rainfall could further enhance the forecast accuracy this could be achieved by integrating the seasonal rainfall forecast from sources like the australian bureau of meteorology s seasonal prediction system bom access s1 hudson et al 2017 2020 the next significant improvement to the model could be integrating ocean atmosphere teleconnections el nino southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod and southern annular mode sam as per the climate change models severely dry and warm seasons could frequently occur ahead evans et al 2017 herold et al 2018 therefore integrating these will leverage the model s capability to forecast hydrological extremes more accurately than the current model 6 conclusions 80 of the variability in 1 6 m and 50 of the variability in 0 1 m of summer season soil moisture can be forecast from rainfall until the end of winter remotely sensed vegetation response and site specific landscape attributes in se australia integrating remotely sensed observations of vegetation growth response to growth drivers has improved the soil moisture forecast accuracy with an enhancement in rmse for deep 1 6 m by 22 8 33 3 and for root zone 0 1 m by 8 8 14 3 also a significant improvement in forecasting hydrological extremes were observed long term remotely sensed observations over forested landscape could relatively better represent site specific landscape attributes evident from its top rank in feature importance list acquired by pushing out soil properties and landscape attributes in predicting soil moisture a computationally light model can be operationalized for se australia to forecast soil moisture 3 months ahead on forested landscape by integrating machine
