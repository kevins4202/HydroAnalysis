17745,elucidating the interactions between algae and associated microbial communities is critical for understanding the mechanisms that mediate the dynamic of harmful algal blooms habs in marine environment however the microbial functional profiles and their biogeochemical potential in habs process remains elusive especially during a complete natural hab cycle here we used pyrosequencing and functional gene array geochip to investigate microbial community dynamics and metabolic potential during a natural dinoflagellate noctiluca scintillans bloom the results shown that bacterioplankton exhibited significant temporal heterogeneity over the course of the bloom stages microbial succession was co driven by environmental parameters and biotic interactions the functional analysis revealed significant variations in microbial metabolism during matter cycling at bloom onset stage metabolic potential associated with iron oxidation and transport was elevated carbon fixation and degradation denitrification phosphorus acquisition and sulfur transfer oxidation were significantly enhanced at the plateau stage during the decline and terminal stages oxidative stress lysis of compounds and toxin degradation protease synthesis increased this work reveal phycosphere microorganisms can enhanced organic c decomposition capacity altered n assimilation rate and s p turnover efficiency and balancing of the fe budget during hab process the ecological linkage analysis has further shown that microbial composition and functional potential were significantly linked to algal blooms occurrence it suggest that structural variability and functional plasticity of microbial communities influence hab trajectory graphical abstract image 1 keywords dinoflagellate bloom microbial communities metabolic functions microecological mechanisms 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs are an ecological disaster and have serious consequences on regional and global scales as they affect the nutritional structure of ecosystems and alter biogeochemical cycles zhang et al 2018 which reduces seafood resources through the release of toxins and threaten human health by food chain transmission christian et al 2019 as such considerable effort has been made to elucidate the dynamics of habs which is critical for their effective management and control zohdi and abbaspour 2019 the occurrence development and extinction of habs is influenced by a combination of abiotic and biotic factors for example water temperature salinity light and nutrient levels have been shown to regulate hab occurrence zheng 2011 seymour et al 2017 however physiochemical factors are not sufficient for hab formation stamps et al 2018 in fact microbial interactions are more critical than environmental parameters in regulating plankton dynamics needham and fuhrman 2016 as demonstrated for algae associated microorganisms teeling et al 2012 2016 klindworth et al 2014 this is due to the key roles of microbes in biogeochemical cycling micro food web structure and production of essential elements for algal cells ferrier et al 2002 recent studies have shown that microbial succession patterns and behavior in phycosphere microenvironments contribute to bloom formation and longevity amin et al 2015 lima mendez et al 2015 the dynamics of bacterioplankton community composition in response to habs sintes et al 2013 thomas et al 2014 and their abiotic effects on the surrounding environment mulholland et al 2009 zhou et al 2018 were shown to be linked to the emergence of habs in microcosm mesocosm experiments riemann et al 2000 tada et al 2012 and in situ surveys lamy et al 2010 tada et al 2011 a typical pattern of dynamic succession of distinct bacterial clades before during and after bloom events in the north sea was observed telling et al 2012 indicating that specific microbial populations occupy transitory ecological niches created by algal derived substrates moreover structural differences in the bacterioplankton community in response to a phaeocystis globosa bloom have been observed by sequencing approaches wemheuer et al 2014 2015 thus bloom initiation and collapse are influenced by bacterial community structure and the abundance of certain taxa the behavior and physiological responses of microorganisms drive ecological processes in biogeochemical cycles previous transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of bacterioplankton community structure and function during a diatom bloom event revealed high metabolic activity associated with rhodobacteraceae and the sar92 clade klindworth et al 2014 the differential expression of functional genes in bacteria during a phaeocystis globosa bloom has also been investigated with a comparative metagenomic approach wemheuer et al 2015 however these studies were mostly carried out in small scale ecosystems or laboratory mesocosm experiments and there are little data from in situ investigations teeling et al 2012 resulting in a lack of detailed knowledge of the structural and functional changes in bacterioplankton during a complete natural dinoflagellate bloom event recent work has highlighted the role of algal bacterial interactions in modulating the marine carbon c cycle from mutualistic and antagonistic standpoints mayali and azma 2004 seyedsayamdost et al 2011 amin et al 2012 durham et al 2015 these interactions presumably also shape the organic matter cycle but there is little experimental evidence regarding the relationship between microbes and specific elements during a bloom clarifying the changes in microbial function at different bloom stages is critical for assessing the ecological impact of habs on biogeochemical cycles brussaard et al 2016 to this end in present study we analyzed field samples over a complete cycle of a dinoflagellate noctiluca scintillans bloom by 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing and using a functional gene microarray geochip 5 0 to survey microbial community dynamics and the metabolic potential of phycosphere microbes we hypothesized that 1 significant temporal heterogeneity was exist in microbial communities and their metabolic potential during different hab stages and 2 the phycosphere microbial abilities on element metabolism carbon nitrogen phosphorus sulfur iron influence hab fate the aim of this study was to supply a new perspective for help us better understand microbial potentiality in regulate hab dynamics in the natural environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection samples were collected from a coastal area of dongchong dc 117 03 24 e 23 44 19 n in shenzhen china where a n scintillans bloom regularly occurs in order to obtain a complete set of bloom samples we monitored the phytoplankton concentration twice a week by track sampling an algal bloom had occurred on february 3 to 16 2016 for a total of 14 time point samples in the bloom cycle that were labeled as dc1 to dc14 respectively three parallel samples were collected at each time point in a niskin bottle each sample consisted of 5 l of seawater the samples were transferred to a polyethylene container and maintained at 4 c during delivery to the laboratory where they were successively filtered through a 300 mesh plankton net to remove large zooplankton and then through a 0 22 Î¼m composite fiber membrane diameter 47 mm millipore billerica ma usa to collect microbes the filters were immediately stored at 80 c before dna extraction in addition a portion of each water sample was fixed with 1 lugol s iodine solution for phytoplankton

partial least squares path modeling pls pm was carried out using the functions in vegan v 2 4e1 and plspm v 0 4 7 packages in r v 3 1 1 http www rproject org 3 results 3 1 bloom characteristics samples were obtained at the following five stages during the bloom event i pre bloom dc1 ii onset dc2 and dc3 iii plateau dc4 and dc5 iv decline dc6 dc10 and v terminal dc11 dc14 blooming dinoflagellates were morphologically identified as predominantly noctiluca scintillans additional file 2 fig s1 the algal cell number ranged from 1 05 102 to 2 53 103 cells ml with the peak value recorded at dc4 which was accompanied by maximum chl a concentration and algal density over the sampling period physical factors temperature salinity and ph biological parameters bacterial and algal abundance and chemical factors chl a concentration fv fm ratio and nutrient nh4 no3 no2 and po4 3 levels varied significantly p 0 05 or p 0 01 consistent with our previous findings sun et al 2017 in addition iron fe3 concentration was lower 0 41 Î¼g l at onset dc3 and gradually increased with bloom progression reaching 1 01 Î¼g l at the decline stage p 0 05 additional file 2 fig s2 total organic c toc increased from 6 1 to 8 2 mg l during the early to middle stages dc1 dc6 and reached a peak 12 6 14 3 mg l at the post bloom stage dc7 dc12 p 0 05 before gradually decreasing and fluctuating between 5 5 and 6 9 mg l additional file 2 fig s2 3 2 microbial community structure and association network as the bloom progressed there were significant alterations in bacterial community composition fig 1 a alphaproteobacteria rhodobacter and pelagibacter gammaproteobacteria alteromonas and halomonas and flavobacteriia tenacibaculum and winogradskyella dominated during bloom onset the relative abundance of fcb group members bacteroides polaribacter and flavobacterium increased 3 7 2 6 and 2 2 fold respectively during bloom progression reaching a peak at the plateau stage p 0 05 in post bloom stage i e decline and terminal stages the dominant taxa were flavobacteriia sediminicola gammaproteobacteria oceanospirilium alteromonas and coraliomargarita and actinobacteria e g mycobacterium which accounted for over 50 of otu tags besides bacteria differences were also observed in the archaea community profile fig 1b methanocellaceae was predominant at bloom onset p 0 05 methanomicrobiaceae and methanocorpusculaceae were most abundant at the plateau stage p 0 05 and ammonia oxidizing archaea nitrosocaldaceae and nitrosopumilaceae along with halobacteriaceae and cenarchaeaceae were present at high levels during bloom decline and terminal stages p 0 05 in terms of 18s otu profiles reflecting eukaryotic community structure dinoflagellates especially the main alga noctilucea became more prevalent with bloom progression p 0 05 fig 1c and additional file 2 fig s3 these results show that there are clear variations in algal community structure at different time points during an hab event this was further confirmed by cluster analyses of 16s and 18s rrna gene sequences at different bloom stages additional file 2 figs s4a and b cca was carried out in order to identify possible factors responsible for the observed variation community composition 16s and distribution were significantly influenced by temperature p 0 01 r2 0 97 additional file 2 fig s5a no3 and nh4 concentrations and toc meanwhile po4 3 nh4 and fe3 levels were the major factors associated with variations in the microeukaryote 18s population additional file 2 fig s5b the detailed relationship between species and nutrient levels is shown in fig s6 additional file 2 partial mantel tests showed that biological communities were more closely correlated with each other than with physicochemical parameters additional file 2 fig s7 we also performed a network co occurrence analysis and found complex interactions including mutualism competition cross feeding parasitism and predation among the main microorganisms analyzed at the family level rickettsiaceae ns 11 12 saprospriaceae winogradskyella flavobacteriaceae and chitinophagaceae were the potential keystone taxa within the network fig 2 a which also revealed a relationship between community members and environmental variables as well as time lagged mutual dependencies overall 76 time lagged correlations among tribes were detected fig 2a showing that time shifted interdependencies are probably prevalent in bacterioplankton communities we constructed a co occurrence network to further clarify correlations between main phycosphere species and the bloom forming alga n scintillans the results showed that n scintillans bloom formation was influenced by plesiocysis lentisphaeraceae thalassomonas marinicellaceae and vibrio whereas bloom termination was affected by winogradskyella oleiphilaceae phytoplankton gryodinium skeletonema and alexandrium as well as some zooplankton such as amoebophrya and syndiniales fig 2b 3 3 general patterns in microbial function in order to elucidate microbial functions during the hab event we performed geochip analysis using seven representative samples from different time points namely onset dc3 plateau dc4 and dc5 decline dc6 dc7 and dc9 and terminal dc13 stages three biological repeats were performed at each phase the observed patterns including functional diversity of genes gene overlap and hierarchical clustering are shown in tables s1 s2 and fig s8 additional file 2 the overall functional profile of an hab event is shown in fig 3 two groups showed heightened fe electron transfer and secondary metabolic potential during bloom onset organic remediation and n p utilization were the major pathways represented during the plateau stage intriguingly genes associated with various types of metabolism were depleted in the decline stage whereas those related to stress response s metabolism and other physiological activities such as metal homeostasis were enriched when the bloom was in the collapse stage the most abundant genes were those responsible for c n metabolism and environmental adaption 3 4 key functional genes involved in carbon c and nitrogen n cycles for c degradation cellulose lignin and starch are the most abundant c sources accordingly microbial genes encoding cellulase lactase and glucoamylase were present in relatively high abundance we also observed that genes involved in the degradation of relatively labile c based molecules e g starch cellulose and hemicellulose were highly represented at mid or mid post bloom stages p 0 05 fig 4 a these included genes encoding pullulanase glucoamylase exoglucanse cellobiase and xylanase which are present in nearly all bacterial taxa additional file 2 fig s9 in addition microbes at these stages exhibited greater capacity for degrading recalcitrant c e g lignin which involves glyoxal oxidase glx manganese peroxidase mnp and phenol oxidase the main contributors to this degradation were alphaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and zetaproteobacteria additional file 2 fig s9 genes such as amoa quasi camdcab and lmo associated with the major biomolecules e g protein sugars and lipids were enriched at the plateau or terminal stage to varying degrees p 0 05 two major c fixation pathways were detected in this work namely glyoxylate cycle acea and aceb and methanogenesis apra and dsra fig 4a components of both pathways were enriched at the post stage and especially at the plateau stage over 2 fold increase p 0 05 these results shown that c fixation potential was enhanced during an hab via reductive acetyl coenzyme coa and 3 hydroxypropionate malyl coa cycle pathways regulated by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and propionyl acetyl coa carboxylase respectively a total of 356 and 402 genes in these two pathways were identified respectively with betaproteobacteria solibacteres synergistia thaumarchaeota and verrucomicrobia as the main contributors additional file 2 fig s9 as for n cycling process genes involved in denitrification assimilation ammonification and nitrification were differentially expressed according to hab stage fig 4b a substantial number 583 of genes involved in denitrification were enriched by 180 250 at the plateau stage compared with the other stages p 0 05 especially nirk and nirs encoding nitrite reductase two genes amya and anyx involved in n assimilation showed increased relative abundance p 0 05 during the hab event and followed similar patterns i e a peak was observed at the plateau stage but the levels decreased to those at bloom onset during the decline stage rebounding only at the terminal stage a similar trend was observed for the nirb gene which is involved in assimilatory n reduction the expression of nirb was 3 times higher at the plateau stage as compared to bloom onset p 0 05 and remained 1 2 1 5 times higher post bloom only one gene urec involved in ammonification was detected in this work the level was 61 2 higher at the plateau stage than at bloom onset p 0 05 there was no difference in the expression of genes involved in nitrification across stages p 0 05 n cycling genes were primarily associated with bacteria and archaea among them proteobacteria response for ammonofication and dinitrification fcb and pvc groups participate in assimilatory n reduction and archaea like euryachaeota involved in nitrification and methanogenic process additional file 2 fig s10 3 5 functional genes involved in phosphorus p sulfur s iron fe metabolism genes related to four p utilization pathways including phytic acid hydrolysis polyphosphate synthesis polyphosphate degradation and p oxidation were differentially expressed according to hab stage e g phytase phytate degradation ppx inorganic polyphosphate degradation and ppk polyphosphate biosynthesis fig 4c for instance compared with bloom onset the relative level of ppk was increased at all other stages especially at the plateau stage 3 times higher p 0 01 bacteroidia accounted for more than half of ppx genes detected in this study followed by coriobacteriia and bacilli additional file 2 fig s11 there were no obvious changes in p oxidation during the hab event with 5f1 htxa 5f1 ppn and 5fi ptxd gene levels showing no statistically significant differences across stages p 0 05 the abundance of s cycling genes showed a similar trend to that of p cycling genes first increasing at the peak of the bloom before decreasing at the decline stage dsrb was the only s reduction gene showing a significant difference in expression during the bloom p 0 01 a total of 218 sulfite reduction related genes were differentially expressed during the hab event dsrb encoding dissimilatory sulfite reductase accounted for nearly 50 of these genes and was attributed to firmicutes 27 4 fibrobacteres 23 5 crenarchaeota 19 7 and chlorobi 11 6 additional file 2 fig s12 three sulfite oxidation genes soxa sox and soxy constituting an s oxidation gene cluster were enriched at each time point examined p 0 05 endoglucanase is an important enzyme for other aspects of s utilization such as dimethylsulfoniopropionate dmsp degradation in total 173 genes involved in dmsp degradation showed positive signal intensity especially at the peak of the bloom p 0 05 among the 1352 fe cycling genes detected 62 8 were involved in fe oxidation including bfr cira feca feob fepa iron and iro most showed the highest abundance p 0 05 at bloom onset fig 4d in contrast to fe oxidation seven fe storage genes fhua fhue fiu fptd fyua hxuc and dps were enriched at the plateau stage p 0 05 genes associated with fe affinity and transports were differentially expressed at the plateau and onset stages respectively two fe affinity genes iron permease high affinity and ferroxidase high affinity were enhanced at the plateau stage p 0 05 and three fe transport genes siderophore transporter vacuolar iron transport and ferric reductase transporter were decreased at the onset stage p 0 05 both sets of genes were enriched at the peak of the hab euryachaeota were mainly responsible for fe oxidation proteobacteria and cyanobacteria for fe transport and storage and bacteroidetes firmicutes pvc group and some acidobacteria species for fe affinity and oxidation additional file 2 fig s13 3 6 stress related genes in phycosphere microorganisms about 16 families of stress related genes showed variable expression across hab stages fig 4e genes mediating the response to temperature stress cold heat shock starvation n p glucose limitation acid base balance acidic alkaline shock and envelope stress p 0 05 were enriched at the plateau stage whereas those associated with oxidative stress osmotic pressure stress oxygen limitation lysis toxin and protease pressure were highly expressed p 0 05 at the decline terminal bloom stages fig 4e most of the genes were attributable to proteobacteria followed by fcb group firmicutes cyanobacteria and actinobacteria in addition some euryachaeota and fungal genes also contributed to this process most of the detected genera are known to be metabolically versatile and involved in multiple matter cycling processes additional file 2 fig s14 3 7 the ecological linkages among environmental parameters microbial functional traits and hab event cca was carried out in order to determine whether environmental variables contributed to the differential abundance of functional genes during hab progression fig 5 a the first two canonical axes explained 31 4 and 30 5 of the constrained variation in the levels of significantly altered functional genes the samples from different stages were well separated along the first canonical axis which was positively correlated with toc po4 3 and no3 concentrations and temperature fig 5a the second axis was positively correlated with nh4 level and ph and negatively correlated with no2 level and salinity the associations between environmental variables and microbial functions show that temperature was the major factor influencing microbial community structure at bloom onset n and p availability affected the structure at the plateau stage and ph had the greatest effect at the decline stage to better integrate these complicated interrelationships we constructed a partial least squares path model pls pm relating functional genes abundance to hab event fig 5b in general algal bloom formation were co associated with the microbial metabolic potential community composition and environmental factors among the functional genes c p fe n and s metabolism showed obvious effects on algal cell concentration with r2 value ranged from 0 109 to 0 599 and p 0 05 or 0 01 showing that matter metabolism was important factor affecting algal bloom occurrence 4 discussion the frequency and intensity of habs are increasing worldwide due to eutrophication from climate change human activities economic expansion and urbanization nwankwegu et al 2019 the dongchong coastal area is a typical example of double coupling i e influenced by both anthropogenic and climatic changes where habs frequently occur as such it is an ideal location for investigating the profiles of natural habs in this study we obtained samples at single day resolution which can reveal patterns in microbial populations in greater detail needham et al 2017 we focused on microbial functions that potentially influence hab formation and progression 4 1 possible factors driving microbial succession clear temporal succession of the bacterioplankton community was observed during hab progression Î± proteobacteria dominated the pre bloom and onset stages whereas flavobacteria and bacteroides were the most highly represented taxa during the plateau stage gammaproteobacteria along with a secondary spike in actinobacter e g mycobacterium and methanogenic archaea methanospirillum methanocorpusculum and methanomicrobium showed the highest abundance during post bloom i e decline and terminal stages fig 1a and b these results imply that phycosphere microorganism populations are heterogeneous during hab formation and that successional patterns are influenced by multiple factors such as temperature salinity irradiance and nutrients levels teeling et al 2012 needham and fuhrman 2016 zhou et al 2018 we found that the relative abundance of 16s species was mainly affected by temperature and nutrient factors such as no3 nh4 and po4 3 levels additional file 2 fig s5 our results support earlier findings that hab community succession is modulated by substrate availability which exerts bottom up control over microbe populations telling et al 2012 garcia et al 2016 it should be noted that there were some differences between the 16s and 18s rrna species indicating that the two kingdoms exhibit distinct sensitiveness to the different abiotic factors besides abiotic parameters biotic factors co presence or exclusion are also important driving forces for shaping microbial communities we observed a variety of network interactions positive or negative among the dominant prokaryotes the positive relationships may represent functional groups of microorganism that perform similar or complementary roles whereas negative correlations could reflect direct interactions such as antagonism or competition eiler et al 2012 time lags in the association network suggested that these groups have overlapping niches and respond to the same physicochemical factors gradually replacing each other over time in a succession time series eiler et al 2012 keystone nodes in the network were highly abundant groups such as ns11 12 flavobacteriaceae richettsiaceae prevatelia winogradskyella chitinophagaceae and halobacteriaceae fig 2a which are presumed to play a critical role in maintaining overall network structure in addition the results of the mantel test showed that biological communities are more closely linked to each other than to environmental factors additional file 2 fig s7 indicating that network interactions positive and negative among species in a community dictate its overall structure which is supported by the previous demonstration that bacterial communities in phycosphere environments are highly influenced by interactions among microorganisms needham and fuhrman 2016 analysis of co occurrence relationship between main microbes and target algae revealed multiple positive or negative correlations during the hab fig 2b suggesting that competitive and cooperative forces were acting concurrently to affect host and shape the microbial community thus biotic factors e g mutualism competition cross feeding and predation may have a greater influence on community structure than previously assumed worden et al 2015 4 2 microbial functions 4 2 1 c cycle c cycle gene distribution in the phycosphere environment was significantly affected by the hab event most of the enriched genes were associated with organic matter degradation fig 4a which was expected because a larger phytoplankton biomass produces greater amounts of organic matter by photosynthesis buchan et al 2014 our analysis of functional gene profiles of microbes in the phycosphere environment revealed a shift away from the utilization of more easily degraded to more recalcitrant c sources specifically the increased levels of genes involved in pyruvate and lignin metabolism and decreased levels of starch metabolism genes suggested that matter was gradually decomposed from macromolecular polysaccharide to monosaccharide and then to smaller molecules organic matter deficiency activates a specialized group of microorganisms producing enzymes that degrade recalcitrant c sources waldrop and firestone 2004 in fact at the post bloom stage we observed an increased abundance of actinobacteria which efficiently utilize more oxidized forms of c yergeau et al 2009 zinger et al 2009 characterization based on c metabolism strategies suggested that the pre bloom stage had a larger fraction of known r strategists whereas the post bloom stage had a higher proportion of k strategists r strategists preferentially consume substances with labile c have high nutritional requirements and exhibit rapid growth when resources are abundant in contrast k strategists have slower growth rates and likely outcompete r strategists under conditions of limited nutrient availability owing to their high substrate affinity fierer et al 2008 we also detected various genes involved in c fixation during the hab event the acea and aceb genes encoding isocitrate lyase were overrepresented at the peak of the bloom indicating that the glyoxylate cycle was more active at the plateau stage than at other stages additionally there are more genes involved in organic acid utilization but fewer genes for isocitrate dehydrogenase biosynthesis it is possible that a large amount of energy was stored for bacteria within the bloom and therefore more isocitric acid than usual entered the glyoxylate cycle via isocitrate lyase catalysis instead of entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle via isocitrate dehydrogenase catalysis the main pathway for energy production resulting in higher net c assimilation rinta kanto et al 2012 from an ecological standpoint shifts in bloom patterns and changes in c utilization and fixation by the microbial community in a bloom may have long term effects on c storage and sequestration zhou et al 2016 phytoplankton blooms extract carbon dioxide co2 from the atmosphere for sequestration in the interior of the ocean a metatranscriptomic analysis showed that factors involved in c4 type c fixation were highly enriched during an hab gong et al 2017 additionally apra and dsra which were mainly contributed by archaea through methanogenesis were overrepresented at the bloom peak zhou et al 2018 it can thus be inferred that habs are an efficient c sink contributed by bacteria and archaea phytoplankton secrete dissolved organic matter especially when nutrients are scarce wear et al 2015 a previous study demonstrated that algae release large amounts of extracellular polysaccharide that form large sticky aggregates under bloom conditions myklestad 1995 some of the colloidal matter secreted by a host is used as dissolved organic c by heterotrophic bacteria croft et al 2006 in such cases bacterial communities have higher biomass and are more efficient in the remineralization of organic substances thereby producing more inorganic matter for phytoplankton cooper and smith 2015 in this work the amoa quasi and camdcab genes involved in the response to organic c synthesis and mineralization were increased at the terminal stage of the bloom fig 4a reflecting more active biomineralization we speculated that n scientillans produces excess polysaccharides and biotins that promote the growth of and acquire essential macro and micronutrients produced by bacteria in order to prolong the bloom 4 2 2 n cycle various genes involved in n metabolism including nitrate ammonium transporter nitrate nitrite reductase and n assimilation suggesting that phycosphere microorganisms use multiple n sources fig 4b the enrichenment of these genes during the bloom process indicated an acceleration of n cycling potential especially for no2 denitrification nirk and nirs and no3 dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium nirb utilization and n assimilation amya and amyx the relative abundance of nitrate nitrite related genes were increased at the plateau stage suggesting enhanced n consumption and a heightened demand for n that was not met by biological n fixation in addition the bloom may have enhanced the transfer potential of nitrate to n2 by stimulating the expression of denitrification related genes nirs and nirk previous study showed that denitrification was decreased by 25 97 28 16 in microcystis aeruginosa yang et al 2017 we also observed that denitrification activity was diminished at the decline stage fig 4b indicating that n limitation is a possible factor contributing to bloom collapse the overrepresentation of n assimilating taxa at the plateau stage implied that n demand and n stress were increased in n scientillans relative to bloom onset or decline stages the higher metabolic demand for n likely stemmed from rapid cell growth within an increasingly n deprived environment as n rich metabolites are critical components for protein biosynthesis and cell wall formation in addition to regulating cellular n status allen et al 2011 ammonium is the preferred n source for most phytoplankton and microalgal species due to of its lower energetic costs for metabolism even when nitrate is sufficient bloom et al 1992 kronzucker et al 1999 in this work the production potential of ammonium from organic n and no2 in the microbial community was increased by enrichment of nira nirb and urec genes fig 4b which may have contributed to bloom duration ammonia ammonium accumulation reflects an elevated n requirement for microbial protein synthesis this was supported by the higher relative metabolic potential of glutamine synthetase glna which mediates the incorporation of ammonium into glutamine leigh and dodsworth 2007 on the other hand the low nh4 concentration at the bloom peak and decreased ammonification activity indicated adaptation to n limitation in microbial communities sun et al 2017 4 2 3 p cycle the most significantly altered p synthesis gene was ppk polyphosphate kinase which was significantly enriched at the bloom peak p is required for rapid a sanguinea growth and bloom formation yang et al 2016 polyphosphate kinase catalyzes the formation of polyphosphate which removes p from water the increase in ppk level may allow the algal biomass to reach a maximal value likewise the ppx gene involved in polyphosphate degradation was highly increased during the bloom plateau stage we previously showed that dissolved inorganic phosphate po4 3 concentration was very low at the bloom peak sun et al 2017 under phosphate limitation algae and bacteria compete for nutrients meanwhile phosphate limitation can also stimulate algal exudate production which promotes the growth of phycosphere bacteria that more effectively remineralize and acquire phosphate hader et al 2014 here we observed that ppx level increased over the course of bloom progression fig 4c increasing exopolyphosphatase activity probably is an important adaptive strategy for p deficiency in algal bacterial interactions another important change was in the level of the phytic acid hydrolysis response gene phytase which was enriched at the plateau stage fig 4c the higher abundance of p starvation genes suggests an increased p demand by dinoflagellates possibly caused by the increased algal biomass hydrolysis products play important roles in photosynthesis respiration and other biological processes lin et al 2016 phytase expression was found to increase under p starvation belgaroui et al 2016 the enrichment of the phytase gene at the peak of the bloom could reflect intra and interspecies competition for limited resources under suboptimal environmental conditions p degradation and conversion activities were decreased at the post bloom stage implying that p limitation prevented bloom formation dai et al 2017 4 2 4 s cycle the main s metabolism genes showing altered relative abundance in the dinoflagellate bloom especially at the peak bloom stage were those related to s oxidation soxa soxb and soxy fig 4c the gene products stimulate the conversion of s2o3 2 to so3 2 which is a precursor in the dmsp synthesis pathway bacteria supply dmsp to support phytoplankton growth curson et al 2017 algal bacterial interactions drive the ocean s cycle through dmsp production and exchange we observed more active degradation of dmsp to dms by the dsyb gene product providing insight into the microbial ecology of s cycling and the contribution of microbial s interactions to hab progression compared with sulfite oxidation only one gene dsrb involved in sulfite reduction was differentially abundance across bloom stages with the peak level observed post bloom at this stage dead phytoplankton are decomposed and the dsrb gene is enriched additional file 2 fig s12 for the transfer of so3 2 to h2s accounting for the foul odor that arises at the end of an hab vargas montero and freer 2004 other s metabolism gene have multiple presumed roles for instance in polysaccharide degradation many algal polysaccharides e g glucan agarans and fucans are sulfated and require enzymes such as endoglucanase for complete degradation uzyol and sacan 2017 in this work endoglucanase gene relative abundance peaked at the plateau stage of the bloom when algal biomass and metabolic potential were also maximal fig 4c this may be because more carbohydrate was needed to compensate for c insufficiency during the bloom as with polysaccharides vitamin biosynthesis also requires the activity of s metabolizing microbes bacteria are the major suppliers of vb12 to dinoflagellates and vb12 biosynthesis genes are enriched under bloom conditions gong et al 2017 our results provide additional evidence that bacterially derived vb12 intermediates are acquired by dinoflagellates and processed to generate vb12 4 2 5 fe metabolism fe is an electron carrier in various protein complexes and has an important role in photosynthesis cellular respiration and other metabolic processes marchetti and maldonado 2016 fv fm values below 0 4 indicate that fe is a limiting factor in biochemical reactions strutton et al 2000 mcminn and hegseth 2004 in this study we observed fv fm 0 4 from dc7 to dc11 indicating that fe is a bio limiting element for algal growth variable responses by the microbial community have been recorded under nutrient amendment highlighting strain specific community responses to fe stress followed by n or p limitation in some taxa shilova et al 2014 these data provide mechanistic insight into changes in microbial communities in response to fluxes in nutrient levels or other environmental factors expression of fe metabolism related genes was found to increase under fe starvation yuan et al 2008 in this work we found that the levels of genes involved in fe oxidation cira feca feob fep iron and iro and transport siderophore transporter vacular transporter and ferric reductase transporter were highest at the pre bloom stage whereas genes associated with fe storage fhue fiu and hxue and affinity permease high affinity and ferroxidase high affinity were enriched at the peak of the bloom suggesting that microbes supply fe for algal growth and that some bacteria have fe sequestration capacity that promotes hab maintenance fig 4d in addition genes for the uptake of siderophore bound fe and fe2 were enriched at bloom onset possibly reflecting a role for fe s clusters and heme in respiratory chains and tricarboxylic cycle satinsky et al 2014 these results demonstrate that microbes have the ability to increase fe oxidation and transport at bloom onset and fe affinity and storage at the post bloom stage this may be attributable to the ability of some organisms to efficiently recycle fe either within the cell or through non redfieldian fe uptake we propose that microbes have the ability to balance the cellular fe budget during an hab 4 3 conceptual model for hab from structure to function among the most important questions in phycosphere ecology is how changes in microbial community structure affect microbial function and subsequent ecological events such as an hab the cca and co occurrence analysis showed that environmental factors and network interactions play important roles in controlling the dynamics of microbial communities fig 2 additional file 2 fig s5 it indicated that the complex interactions such as mutualistic or antagonistic among bacterial bacterial and algal bacterial are crucial factor affecting the habs dynamics amin et al 2012 additionally clearly temporal heterogeneity of microbial communities and metabolic activities was appeared among various algal bloom stages figs 1 and 4 the pls pm analysis also revealed that microbial composition and function co effect algal proliferation fig 5b these results implying a link between structural changes and functional plasticity in habs telling et al 2012 meanwhile the microbial functional potential especially the c p fe metabolism had bigger contribution to algal biomass providing evidence that the altered functional potential may be closely related to the occurrence of algal bloom event genes related to cell proliferation carbohydrate metabolism and energy flux were enriched at bloom onset whereas those associated with lipid and s metabolism and environmental adaption were overrepresented at both onset and decline stages fig 3 based on the above observations we propose a simple conceptual model of how microbial behavior influences an hab event fig 6 firstly microbial communities respond dynamically to an hab which in turn shapes community structure secondly in response to an hab microbial genes involved in key n cycling processes e g nirs k for denitrification nirb and nrfa for nitrate and nitrite reduction respectively and urec for ammonium oxidation are enhanced these are linked to other nutrient cycling pathways including c degradation and fixation s cycling sulfite oxidation and dmsp production and p metabolism whose key genes are largely derived from microorganisms with diverse physiological and metabolic features alterations in key functional processes are reflected in the increased metabolic versatility and availability of electron acceptors donors e g fe metabolism related molecules thus microbial behavior at different bloom stages facilitates the initiation maintenance and collapse of habs however one important point needs to note that there are still many challenges in linking microbiome changes to algal bloom event directly particularly in complex cycles and without accounting for intermediate mechanistic steps hall et al 2018 more comprehensive monitoring of microbial community dynamics along with physical chemical and biological analyses of ecosystem properties and functions is needed to clarify the precise contribution of microbes to habs 5 conclusions the results of our study support our hypotheses and provide potential novel insight into how changes in microbial community structure and function influence hab fate the microbial population initially contributed to fe acquisition oxidation and transport in the middle phase to c fixation and degradation as well as n and p uptake and in the late phase to s cycling secondary metabolite production and environmental stress response proteobacteria were the primary mediators of c and n metabolism fcb acidobacter and actinobacter participated in s p cycling and bacterodidetes were the major regulators of fe cycling additionally some bacteria had a broad metabolic spectrum and exhibited functional complementation although recent work has revealed partial correlations between phylogenetic diversity and functional profiles there may not always be a clear relationship between functional features and specific species due to functional redundancy across taxa rillig et al 2015 which uncouples ecological attributes from phylogeny barberan et al 2014 furthermore these findings are based on eight metagenomics in an algal bloom event which consists of a limited dataset for statistical analyses and are needed to be further tested with more hab samples therefore future studies that increasing the sample size and using new technologies such as stable isotope probing nanosims imaging and omics approaches to more precisely target specific biogeochemical processes are essential

17745,elucidating the interactions between algae and associated microbial communities is critical for understanding the mechanisms that mediate the dynamic of harmful algal blooms habs in marine environment however the microbial functional profiles and their biogeochemical potential in habs process remains elusive especially during a complete natural hab cycle here we used pyrosequencing and functional gene array geochip to investigate microbial community dynamics and metabolic potential during a natural dinoflagellate noctiluca scintillans bloom the results shown that bacterioplankton exhibited significant temporal heterogeneity over the course of the bloom stages microbial succession was co driven by environmental parameters and biotic interactions the functional analysis revealed significant variations in microbial metabolism during matter cycling at bloom onset stage metabolic potential associated with iron oxidation and transport was elevated carbon fixation and degradation denitrification phosphorus acquisition and sulfur transfer oxidation were significantly enhanced at the plateau stage during the decline and terminal stages oxidative stress lysis of compounds and toxin degradation protease synthesis increased this work reveal phycosphere microorganisms can enhanced organic c decomposition capacity altered n assimilation rate and s p turnover efficiency and balancing of the fe budget during hab process the ecological linkage analysis has further shown that microbial composition and functional potential were significantly linked to algal blooms occurrence it suggest that structural variability and functional plasticity of microbial communities influence hab trajectory graphical abstract image 1 keywords dinoflagellate bloom microbial communities metabolic functions microecological mechanisms 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs are an ecological disaster and have serious consequences on regional and global scales as they affect the nutritional structure of ecosystems and alter biogeochemical cycles zhang et al 2018 which reduces seafood resources through the release of toxins and threaten human health by food chain transmission christian et al 2019 as such considerable effort has been made to elucidate the dynamics of habs which is critical for their effective management and control zohdi and abbaspour 2019 the occurrence development and extinction of habs is influenced by a combination of abiotic and biotic factors for example water temperature salinity light and nutrient levels have been shown to regulate hab occurrence zheng 2011 seymour et al 2017 however physiochemical factors are not sufficient for hab formation stamps et al 2018 in fact microbial interactions are more critical than environmental parameters in regulating plankton dynamics needham and fuhrman 2016 as demonstrated for algae associated microorganisms teeling et al 2012 2016 klindworth et al 2014 this is due to the key roles of microbes in biogeochemical cycling micro food web structure and production of essential elements for algal cells ferrier et al 2002 recent studies have shown that microbial succession patterns and behavior in phycosphere microenvironments contribute to bloom formation and longevity amin et al 2015 lima mendez et al 2015 the dynamics of bacterioplankton community composition in response to habs sintes et al 2013 thomas et al 2014 and their abiotic effects on the surrounding environment mulholland et al 2009 zhou et al 2018 were shown to be linked to the emergence of habs in microcosm mesocosm experiments riemann et al 2000 tada et al 2012 and in situ surveys lamy et al 2010 tada et al 2011 a typical pattern of dynamic succession of distinct bacterial clades before during and after bloom events in the north sea was observed telling et al 2012 indicating that specific microbial populations occupy transitory ecological niches created by algal derived substrates moreover structural differences in the bacterioplankton community in response to a phaeocystis globosa bloom have been observed by sequencing approaches wemheuer et al 2014 2015 thus bloom initiation and collapse are influenced by bacterial community structure and the abundance of certain taxa the behavior and physiological responses of microorganisms drive ecological processes in biogeochemical cycles previous transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of bacterioplankton community structure and function during a diatom bloom event revealed high metabolic activity associated with rhodobacteraceae and the sar92 clade klindworth et al 2014 the differential expression of functional genes in bacteria during a phaeocystis globosa bloom has also been investigated with a comparative metagenomic approach wemheuer et al 2015 however these studies were mostly carried out in small scale ecosystems or laboratory mesocosm experiments and there are little data from in situ investigations teeling et al 2012 resulting in a lack of detailed knowledge of the structural and functional changes in bacterioplankton during a complete natural dinoflagellate bloom event recent work has highlighted the role of algal bacterial interactions in modulating the marine carbon c cycle from mutualistic and antagonistic standpoints mayali and azma 2004 seyedsayamdost et al 2011 amin et al 2012 durham et al 2015 these interactions presumably also shape the organic matter cycle but there is little experimental evidence regarding the relationship between microbes and specific elements during a bloom clarifying the changes in microbial function at different bloom stages is critical for assessing the ecological impact of habs on biogeochemical cycles brussaard et al 2016 to this end in present study we analyzed field samples over a complete cycle of a dinoflagellate noctiluca scintillans bloom by 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing and using a functional gene microarray geochip 5 0 to survey microbial community dynamics and the metabolic potential of phycosphere microbes we hypothesized that 1 significant temporal heterogeneity was exist in microbial communities and their metabolic potential during different hab stages and 2 the phycosphere microbial abilities on element metabolism carbon nitrogen phosphorus sulfur iron influence hab fate the aim of this study was to supply a new perspective for help us better understand microbial potentiality in regulate hab dynamics in the natural environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection samples were collected from a coastal area of dongchong dc 117 03 24 e 23 44 19 n in shenzhen china where a n scintillans bloom regularly occurs in order to obtain a complete set of bloom samples we monitored the phytoplankton concentration twice a week by track sampling an algal bloom had occurred on february 3 to 16 2016 for a total of 14 time point samples in the bloom cycle that were labeled as dc1 to dc14 respectively three parallel samples were collected at each time point in a niskin bottle each sample consisted of 5 l of seawater the samples were transferred to a polyethylene container and maintained at 4 c during delivery to the laboratory where they were successively filtered through a 300 mesh plankton net to remove large zooplankton and then through a 0 22 Î¼m composite fiber membrane diameter 47 mm millipore billerica ma

and filtered according to a published method huse et al 2007 after removing low quality reads representative sequences were annotated using basic local alignment search tool against the ribosomal database project and silva database augmented with sequences from major marine taxa for 16s and 18s rrna gene sequences we assigned operational taxonomic units otus at a 3 gene identity threshold

samples were obtained at the following five stages during the bloom event i pre bloom dc1 ii onset dc2 and dc3 iii plateau dc4 and dc5 iv decline dc6 dc10 and v terminal dc11 dc14 blooming dinoflagellates were morphologically identified as predominantly noctiluca scintillans additional file 2 fig s1 the algal cell number ranged from 1 05 102 to 2 53 103 cells ml with the peak value recorded at dc4 which was accompanied by maximum chl a concentration and algal density over the sampling period physical factors temperature salinity and ph biological parameters bacterial and algal abundance and chemical factors chl a concentration fv fm ratio and nutrient nh4 no3 no2 and po4 3 levels varied significantly p 0 05 or p 0 01 consistent with our previous findings sun et al 2017 in addition iron fe3 concentration was lower 0 41 Î¼g l at onset dc3 and gradually increased with bloom progression reaching 1 01 Î¼g l at the decline stage p 0 05 additional file 2 fig s2 total organic c toc increased from 6 1 to 8 2 mg l during the early to middle stages dc1 dc6 and reached a peak 12 6 14 3 mg l at the post bloom stage dc7 dc12 p 0 05 before gradually decreasing and fluctuating between 5 5 and 6 9 mg l additional file 2 fig s2 3 2 microbial community structure and association network as the bloom progressed there were significant alterations in bacterial community composition fig 1 a alphaproteobacteria rhodobacter and pelagibacter gammaproteobacteria alteromonas and halomonas and flavobacteriia tenacibaculum and winogradskyella dominated during bloom onset the relative abundance of fcb group members bacteroides polaribacter and flavobacterium increased 3 7 2 6 and 2 2 fold respectively during bloom progression reaching a peak at the plateau stage p 0 05 in post bloom stage i e decline and terminal stages the dominant taxa were flavobacteriia sediminicola gammaproteobacteria oceanospirilium alteromonas and coraliomargarita and actinobacteria e g mycobacterium which accounted for over 50 of otu tags besides bacteria differences were also observed in the archaea community profile fig 1b methanocellaceae was predominant at bloom onset p 0 05 methanomicrobiaceae and methanocorpusculaceae were most abundant at the plateau stage p 0 05 and ammonia oxidizing archaea nitrosocaldaceae and nitrosopumilaceae along with halobacteriaceae and cenarchaeaceae were present at high levels during bloom decline and terminal stages p 0 05 in terms of 18s otu profiles reflecting eukaryotic community structure dinoflagellates especially the main alga noctilucea became more prevalent with bloom progression p 0 05 fig 1c and additional file 2 fig s3 these results show that there are clear variations in algal community structure at different time points during an hab event this was further confirmed by cluster analyses of 16s and 18s rrna gene sequences at different bloom stages additional file 2 figs s4a and b cca was carried out in order to identify possible factors responsible for the observed variation community composition 16s and distribution were significantly influenced by temperature p 0 01 r2 0 97 additional file 2 fig s5a no3 and nh4 concentrations and toc meanwhile po4 3 nh4 and fe3 levels were the major factors associated with variations in the microeukaryote 18s population additional file 2 fig s5b the detailed relationship between species and nutrient levels is shown in fig s6 additional file 2 partial mantel tests showed that biological communities were more closely correlated with each other than with physicochemical parameters additional file 2 fig s7 we also performed a network co occurrence analysis and found complex interactions including mutualism competition cross feeding parasitism and predation among the main microorganisms analyzed at the family level rickettsiaceae ns 11 12 saprospriaceae winogradskyella flavobacteriaceae and chitinophagaceae were the potential keystone taxa within the network fig 2 a which also revealed a relationship between community members and environmental variables as well as time lagged mutual dependencies overall 76 time lagged correlations among tribes were detected fig 2a showing that time shifted interdependencies are probably prevalent in bacterioplankton communities we constructed a co occurrence network to further clarify correlations between main phycosphere species and the bloom forming alga n scintillans the results showed that n scintillans bloom formation was influenced by plesiocysis lentisphaeraceae thalassomonas marinicellaceae and vibrio whereas bloom termination was affected by winogradskyella oleiphilaceae phytoplankton gryodinium skeletonema and alexandrium as well as some zooplankton such as amoebophrya and syndiniales fig 2b 3 3 general patterns in microbial function in order to elucidate microbial functions during the hab event we performed geochip analysis using seven representative samples from different time points namely onset dc3 plateau dc4 and dc5 decline dc6 dc7 and dc9 and terminal dc13 stages three biological repeats were performed at each phase the observed patterns including functional diversity of genes gene overlap and hierarchical clustering are shown in tables s1 s2 and fig s8 additional file 2 the overall functional profile of an hab event is shown in fig 3 two groups showed heightened fe electron transfer and secondary metabolic potential during bloom onset organic remediation and n p utilization were the major pathways represented during the plateau stage intriguingly genes associated with various types of metabolism were depleted in the decline stage whereas those related to stress response s metabolism and other physiological activities such as metal homeostasis were enriched when the bloom was in the collapse stage the most abundant genes were those responsible for c n metabolism and environmental adaption 3 4 key functional genes involved in carbon c and nitrogen n cycles for c degradation cellulose lignin and starch are the most abundant c sources accordingly microbial genes encoding cellulase lactase and glucoamylase were present in relatively high abundance we also observed that genes involved in the degradation of relatively labile c based molecules e g starch cellulose and hemicellulose were highly represented at mid or mid post bloom stages p 0 05 fig 4 a these included genes encoding pullulanase glucoamylase exoglucanse cellobiase and xylanase which are present in nearly all bacterial taxa additional file 2 fig s9 in addition microbes at these stages exhibited greater capacity for degrading recalcitrant c e g lignin which involves glyoxal oxidase glx manganese peroxidase mnp and phenol oxidase the main contributors to this degradation were alphaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and zetaproteobacteria additional file 2 fig s9 genes such as amoa quasi camdcab and lmo associated with the major biomolecules e g protein sugars and lipids were enriched at the plateau or terminal stage to varying degrees p 0 05 two major c fixation pathways were detected in this work namely glyoxylate cycle acea and aceb and methanogenesis apra and dsra fig 4a components of both pathways were enriched at the post stage and especially at the plateau stage over 2 fold increase p 0 05 these results shown that c fixation potential was enhanced during an hab via reductive acetyl coenzyme coa and 3 hydroxypropionate malyl coa cycle pathways regulated by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and propionyl acetyl coa carboxylase respectively a total of 356 and 402 genes in these two pathways were identified respectively with betaproteobacteria solibacteres synergistia thaumarchaeota and verrucomicrobia as the main contributors additional file 2 fig s9 as for n cycling process genes involved in denitrification assimilation ammonification and nitrification were differentially expressed according to hab stage fig 4b a substantial number 583 of genes involved in denitrification were enriched by 180 250 at the plateau stage compared with the other stages p 0 05 especially nirk and nirs encoding nitrite reductase two genes amya and anyx involved in n assimilation showed increased relative abundance p 0 05 during the hab event and followed similar patterns i e a peak was observed at the plateau stage but the levels decreased to those at bloom onset during the decline stage rebounding only at the terminal stage a similar trend was observed for the nirb gene which is involved in assimilatory n reduction the expression of nirb was 3 times higher at the plateau stage as compared to bloom onset p 0 05 and remained 1 2 1 5 times higher post bloom only one gene urec involved in ammonification was detected in this work the level was 61 2 higher at the plateau stage than at bloom onset p 0 05 there was no difference in the expression of genes involved in nitrification across stages p 0 05 n cycling genes were primarily associated with bacteria and archaea among them proteobacteria response for ammonofication and dinitrification fcb and pvc groups participate in assimilatory n reduction and archaea like euryachaeota involved in nitrification and methanogenic process additional file 2 fig s10 3 5 functional genes involved in phosphorus p sulfur s iron fe metabolism genes related to four p utilization pathways including phytic acid hydrolysis polyphosphate synthesis polyphosphate degradation and p oxidation were differentially expressed according to hab stage e g phytase phytate degradation ppx inorganic polyphosphate degradation and ppk polyphosphate biosynthesis fig 4c for instance compared with bloom onset the relative level of ppk was increased at all other stages especially at the plateau stage 3 times higher p 0 01 bacteroidia accounted for more than half of ppx genes detected in this study followed by coriobacteriia and bacilli additional file 2 fig s11 there were no obvious changes in p oxidation during the hab event with 5f1 htxa 5f1 ppn and 5fi ptxd gene levels showing no statistically significant differences across stages p 0 05 the abundance of s cycling genes showed a similar trend to that of p cycling genes first increasing at the peak of the bloom before decreasing at the decline stage dsrb was the only s reduction gene showing a significant difference in expression during the bloom p 0 01 a total of 218 sulfite reduction related genes were differentially expressed during the hab event dsrb encoding dissimilatory sulfite reductase accounted for nearly 50 of these genes and was attributed to firmicutes 27 4 fibrobacteres 23 5 crenarchaeota 19 7 and chlorobi 11 6 additional file 2 fig s12 three sulfite oxidation genes soxa sox and soxy constituting an s oxidation gene cluster were enriched at each time point examined p 0 05 endoglucanase is an important enzyme for other aspects of s utilization such as dimethylsulfoniopropionate dmsp degradation in total 173 genes involved in dmsp degradation showed positive signal intensity especially at the peak of the bloom p 0 05 among the 1352 fe cycling genes detected 62 8 were involved in fe oxidation including bfr cira feca feob fepa iron and iro most showed the highest abundance p 0 05 at bloom onset fig 4d in contrast to fe oxidation seven fe storage genes fhua fhue fiu fptd fyua hxuc and dps were enriched at the plateau stage p 0 05 genes associated with fe affinity and transports were differentially expressed at the plateau and onset stages respectively two fe affinity genes iron permease high affinity and ferroxidase high affinity were enhanced at the plateau stage p 0 05 and three fe transport genes siderophore transporter vacuolar iron transport and ferric reductase transporter were decreased at the onset stage p 0 05 both sets of genes were enriched at the peak of the hab euryachaeota were mainly responsible for fe oxidation proteobacteria and cyanobacteria for fe transport and storage and bacteroidetes firmicutes pvc group and some acidobacteria species for fe affinity and oxidation additional file 2 fig s13 3 6 stress related genes in phycosphere microorganisms about 16 families of stress related genes showed variable expression across hab stages fig 4e genes mediating the response to temperature stress cold heat shock starvation n p glucose limitation acid base balance acidic alkaline shock and envelope stress p 0 05 were enriched at the plateau stage whereas those associated with oxidative stress osmotic pressure stress oxygen limitation lysis toxin and protease pressure were highly expressed p 0 05 at the decline terminal bloom stages fig 4e most of the genes were attributable to proteobacteria followed by fcb group firmicutes cyanobacteria and actinobacteria in addition some euryachaeota and fungal genes also contributed to this process most of the detected genera are known to be metabolically versatile and involved in multiple matter cycling processes additional file 2 fig s14 3 7 the ecological linkages among environmental parameters microbial functional traits and hab event cca was carried out in order to determine whether environmental variables contributed to the differential abundance of functional genes during hab progression fig 5 a the first two canonical axes explained 31 4 and 30 5 of the constrained variation in the levels of significantly altered functional genes the samples from different stages were well separated along the first canonical axis which was positively correlated with toc po4 3 and no3 concentrations and temperature fig 5a the second axis was positively correlated with nh4 level and ph and negatively correlated with no2 level and salinity the associations between environmental variables and microbial functions show that temperature was the major factor influencing microbial community structure at bloom onset n and p availability affected the structure at the plateau stage and ph had the greatest effect at the decline stage to better integrate these complicated interrelationships we constructed a partial least squares path model pls pm relating functional genes abundance to hab event fig 5b in general algal bloom formation were co associated with the microbial metabolic potential community composition and environmental factors among the functional genes c p fe n and s metabolism showed obvious effects on algal cell concentration with r2 value ranged from 0 109 to 0 599 and p 0 05 or 0 01 showing that matter metabolism was important factor affecting algal bloom occurrence 4 discussion the frequency and intensity of habs are increasing worldwide due to eutrophication from climate change human activities economic expansion and urbanization nwankwegu et al 2019 the dongchong coastal area is a typical example of double coupling i e influenced by both anthropogenic and climatic changes where habs frequently occur as such it is an ideal location for investigating the profiles of natural habs in this study we obtained samples at single day resolution which can reveal patterns in microbial populations in greater detail needham et al 2017 we focused on microbial functions that potentially influence hab formation and progression 4 1 possible factors driving microbial succession clear temporal succession of the bacterioplankton community was observed during hab progression Î± proteobacteria dominated the pre bloom and onset stages whereas flavobacteria and bacteroides were the most highly represented taxa during the plateau stage gammaproteobacteria along with a secondary spike in actinobacter e g mycobacterium and methanogenic archaea methanospirillum methanocorpusculum and methanomicrobium showed the highest abundance during post bloom i e decline and terminal stages fig 1a and b these results imply that phycosphere microorganism populations are heterogeneous during hab formation and that successional patterns are influenced by multiple factors such as temperature salinity irradiance and nutrients levels teeling et al 2012 needham and fuhrman 2016 zhou et al 2018 we found that the relative abundance of 16s species was mainly affected by temperature and nutrient factors such as no3 nh4 and po4 3 levels additional file 2 fig s5 our results support earlier findings that hab community succession is modulated by substrate availability which exerts bottom up control over microbe populations telling et al 2012 garcia et al 2016 it should be noted that there were some differences between the 16s and 18s rrna species indicating that the two kingdoms exhibit distinct sensitiveness to the different abiotic factors besides abiotic parameters biotic factors co presence or exclusion are also important driving forces for shaping microbial communities we observed a variety of network interactions positive or negative among the dominant prokaryotes the positive relationships may represent functional groups of microorganism that perform similar or complementary roles whereas negative correlations could reflect direct interactions such as antagonism or competition eiler et al 2012 time lags in the association network suggested that these groups have overlapping niches and respond to the same physicochemical factors gradually replacing each other over time in a succession time series eiler et al 2012 keystone nodes in the network were highly abundant groups such as ns11 12 flavobacteriaceae richettsiaceae prevatelia winogradskyella chitinophagaceae and halobacteriaceae fig 2a which are presumed to play a critical role in maintaining overall network structure in addition the results of the mantel test showed that biological communities are more closely linked to each other than to environmental factors additional file 2 fig s7 indicating that network interactions positive and negative among species in a community dictate its overall structure which is supported by the previous demonstration that bacterial communities in phycosphere environments are highly influenced by interactions among microorganisms needham and fuhrman 2016 analysis of co occurrence relationship between main microbes and target algae revealed multiple positive or negative correlations during the hab fig 2b suggesting that competitive and cooperative forces were acting concurrently to affect host and shape the microbial community thus biotic factors e g mutualism competition cross feeding and predation may have a greater influence on community structure than previously assumed worden et al 2015 4 2 microbial functions 4 2 1 c cycle c cycle gene distribution in the phycosphere environment was significantly affected by the hab event most of the enriched genes were associated with organic matter degradation fig 4a which was expected because a larger phytoplankton biomass produces greater amounts of organic matter by photosynthesis buchan et al 2014 our analysis of functional gene profiles of microbes in the phycosphere environment revealed a shift away from the utilization of more easily degraded to more recalcitrant c sources specifically the increased levels of genes involved in pyruvate and lignin metabolism and decreased levels of starch metabolism genes suggested that matter was gradually decomposed from macromolecular polysaccharide to monosaccharide and then to smaller molecules organic matter deficiency activates a specialized group of microorganisms producing enzymes that degrade recalcitrant c sources waldrop and firestone 2004 in fact at the post bloom stage we observed an increased abundance of actinobacteria which efficiently utilize more oxidized forms of c yergeau et al 2009 zinger et al 2009 characterization based on c metabolism strategies suggested that the pre bloom stage had a larger fraction of known r strategists whereas the post bloom stage had a higher proportion of k strategists r strategists preferentially consume substances with labile c have high nutritional requirements and exhibit rapid growth when resources are abundant in contrast k strategists have slower growth rates and likely outcompete r strategists under conditions of limited nutrient availability owing to their high substrate affinity fierer et al 2008 we also detected various genes involved in c fixation during the hab event the acea and aceb genes encoding isocitrate lyase were overrepresented at the peak of the bloom indicating that the glyoxylate cycle was more active at the plateau stage than at other stages additionally there are more genes involved in organic acid utilization but fewer genes for isocitrate dehydrogenase biosynthesis it is possible that a large amount of energy was stored for bacteria within the bloom and therefore more isocitric acid than usual entered the glyoxylate cycle via isocitrate lyase catalysis instead of entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle via isocitrate dehydrogenase catalysis the main pathway for energy production resulting in higher net c assimilation rinta kanto et al 2012 from an ecological standpoint shifts in bloom patterns and changes in c utilization and fixation by the microbial community in a bloom may have long term effects on c storage and sequestration zhou et al 2016 phytoplankton blooms extract carbon dioxide co2 from the atmosphere for sequestration in the interior of the ocean a metatranscriptomic analysis showed that factors involved in c4 type c fixation were highly enriched during an hab gong et al 2017 additionally apra and dsra which were mainly contributed by archaea through methanogenesis were overrepresented at the bloom peak zhou et al 2018 it can thus be inferred that habs are an efficient c sink contributed by bacteria and archaea phytoplankton secrete dissolved organic matter especially when nutrients are scarce wear et al 2015 a previous study demonstrated that algae release large amounts of extracellular polysaccharide that form large sticky aggregates under bloom conditions myklestad 1995 some of the colloidal matter secreted by a host is used as dissolved organic c by heterotrophic bacteria croft et al 2006 in such cases bacterial communities have higher biomass and are more efficient in the remineralization of organic substances thereby producing more inorganic matter for phytoplankton cooper and smith 2015 in this work the amoa quasi and camdcab genes involved in the response to organic c synthesis and mineralization were increased at the terminal stage of the bloom fig 4a reflecting more active biomineralization we speculated that n scientillans produces excess polysaccharides and biotins that promote the growth of and acquire essential macro and micronutrients produced by bacteria in order to prolong the bloom 4 2 2 n cycle various genes involved in n metabolism including nitrate ammonium transporter nitrate nitrite reductase and n assimilation suggesting that phycosphere microorganisms use multiple n sources fig 4b the enrichenment of these genes during the bloom process indicated an acceleration of n cycling potential especially for no2 denitrification nirk and nirs and no3 dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium nirb utilization and n assimilation amya and amyx the relative abundance of nitrate nitrite related genes were increased at the plateau stage suggesting enhanced n consumption and a heightened demand for n that was not met by biological n fixation in addition the bloom may have enhanced the transfer potential of nitrate to n2 by stimulating the expression of denitrification related genes nirs and nirk previous study showed that denitrification was decreased by 25 97 28 16 in microcystis aeruginosa yang et al 2017 we also observed that denitrification activity was diminished at the decline stage fig 4b indicating that n limitation is a possible factor contributing to bloom collapse the overrepresentation of n assimilating taxa at the plateau stage implied that n demand and n stress were increased in n scientillans relative to bloom onset or decline stages the higher metabolic demand for n likely stemmed from rapid cell growth within an increasingly n deprived environment as n rich metabolites are critical components for protein biosynthesis and cell wall formation in addition to regulating cellular n status allen et al 2011 ammonium is the preferred n source for most phytoplankton and microalgal species due to of its lower energetic costs for metabolism even when nitrate is sufficient bloom et al 1992 kronzucker et al 1999 in this work the production potential of ammonium from organic n and no2 in the microbial community was increased by enrichment of nira nirb and urec genes fig 4b which may have contributed to bloom duration ammonia ammonium accumulation reflects an elevated n requirement for microbial protein synthesis this was supported by the higher relative metabolic potential of glutamine synthetase glna which mediates the incorporation of ammonium into glutamine leigh and dodsworth 2007 on the other hand the low nh4 concentration at the bloom peak and decreased ammonification activity indicated adaptation to n limitation in microbial communities sun et al 2017 4 2 3 p cycle the most significantly altered p synthesis gene was ppk polyphosphate kinase which was significantly enriched at the bloom peak p is required for rapid a sanguinea growth and bloom formation yang et al 2016 polyphosphate kinase catalyzes the formation of polyphosphate which removes p from water the increase in ppk level may allow the algal biomass to reach a maximal value likewise the ppx gene involved in polyphosphate degradation was highly increased during the bloom plateau stage we previously showed that dissolved inorganic phosphate po4 3 concentration was very low at the bloom peak sun et al 2017 under phosphate limitation algae and bacteria compete for nutrients meanwhile phosphate limitation can also stimulate algal exudate production which promotes the growth of phycosphere bacteria that more effectively remineralize and acquire phosphate hader et al 2014 here we observed that ppx level increased over the course of bloom progression fig 4c increasing exopolyphosphatase activity probably is an important adaptive strategy for p deficiency in algal bacterial interactions another important change was in the level of the phytic acid hydrolysis response gene phytase which was enriched at the plateau stage fig 4c the higher abundance of p starvation genes suggests an increased p demand by dinoflagellates possibly caused by the increased algal biomass hydrolysis products play important roles in photosynthesis respiration and other biological processes lin et al 2016 phytase expression was found to increase under p starvation belgaroui et al 2016 the enrichment of the phytase gene at the peak of the bloom could reflect intra and interspecies competition for limited resources under suboptimal environmental conditions p degradation and conversion activities were decreased at the post bloom stage implying that p limitation prevented bloom formation dai et al 2017 4 2 4 s cycle the main s metabolism genes showing altered relative abundance in the dinoflagellate bloom especially at the peak bloom stage were those related to s oxidation soxa soxb and soxy fig 4c the gene products stimulate the conversion of s2o3 2 to so3 2 which is a precursor in the dmsp synthesis pathway bacteria supply dmsp to support phytoplankton growth curson et al 2017 algal bacterial interactions drive the ocean s cycle through dmsp production and exchange we observed more active degradation of dmsp to dms by the dsyb gene product providing insight into the microbial ecology of s cycling and the contribution of microbial s interactions to hab progression compared with sulfite oxidation only one gene dsrb involved in sulfite reduction was differentially abundance across bloom stages with the peak level observed post bloom at this stage dead phytoplankton are decomposed and the dsrb gene is enriched additional file 2 fig s12 for the transfer of so3 2 to h2s accounting for the foul odor that arises at the end of an hab vargas montero and freer 2004 other s metabolism gene have multiple presumed roles for instance in polysaccharide degradation many algal polysaccharides e g glucan agarans and fucans are sulfated and require enzymes such as endoglucanase for complete degradation uzyol and sacan 2017 in this work endoglucanase gene relative abundance peaked at the plateau stage of the bloom when algal biomass and metabolic potential were also maximal fig 4c this may be because more carbohydrate was needed to compensate for c insufficiency during the bloom as with polysaccharides vitamin biosynthesis also requires the activity of s metabolizing microbes bacteria are the major suppliers of vb12 to dinoflagellates and vb12 biosynthesis genes are enriched under bloom conditions gong et al 2017 our results provide additional evidence that bacterially derived vb12 intermediates are acquired by dinoflagellates and processed to generate vb12 4 2 5 fe metabolism fe is an electron carrier in various protein complexes and has an important role in photosynthesis cellular respiration and other metabolic processes marchetti and maldonado 2016 fv fm values below 0 4 indicate that fe is a limiting factor in biochemical reactions strutton et al 2000 mcminn and hegseth 2004 in this study we observed fv fm 0 4 from dc7 to dc11 indicating that fe is a bio limiting element for algal growth variable responses by the microbial community have been recorded under nutrient amendment highlighting strain specific community responses to fe stress followed by n or p limitation in some taxa shilova et al 2014 these data provide mechanistic insight into changes in microbial communities in response to fluxes in nutrient levels or other environmental factors expression of fe metabolism related genes was found to increase under fe starvation yuan et al 2008 in this work we found that the levels of genes involved in fe oxidation cira feca feob fep iron and iro and transport siderophore transporter vacular transporter and ferric reductase transporter were highest at the pre bloom stage whereas genes associated with fe storage fhue fiu and hxue and affinity permease high affinity and ferroxidase high affinity were enriched at the peak of the bloom suggesting that microbes supply fe for algal growth and that some bacteria have fe sequestration capacity that promotes hab maintenance fig 4d in addition genes for the uptake of siderophore bound fe and fe2 were enriched at bloom onset possibly reflecting a role for fe s clusters and heme in respiratory chains and tricarboxylic cycle satinsky et al 2014 these results demonstrate that microbes have the ability to increase fe oxidation and transport at bloom onset and fe affinity and storage at the post bloom stage this may be attributable to the ability of some organisms to efficiently recycle fe either within the cell or through non redfieldian fe uptake we propose that microbes have the ability to balance the cellular fe budget during an hab 4 3 conceptual model for hab from structure to function among the most important questions in phycosphere ecology is how changes in microbial community structure affect microbial function and subsequent ecological events such as an hab the cca and co occurrence analysis showed that environmental factors and network interactions play important roles in controlling the dynamics of microbial communities fig 2 additional file 2 fig s5 it indicated that the complex interactions such as mutualistic or antagonistic among bacterial bacterial and algal bacterial are crucial factor affecting the habs dynamics amin et al 2012 additionally clearly temporal heterogeneity of microbial communities and metabolic activities was appeared among various algal bloom stages figs 1 and 4 the pls pm analysis also revealed that microbial composition and function co effect algal proliferation fig 5b these results implying a link between structural changes and functional plasticity in habs telling et al 2012 meanwhile the microbial functional potential especially the c p fe metabolism had bigger contribution to algal biomass providing evidence that the altered functional potential may be closely related to the occurrence of algal bloom event genes related to cell proliferation carbohydrate metabolism and energy flux were enriched at bloom onset whereas those associated with lipid and s metabolism and environmental adaption were overrepresented at both onset and decline stages fig 3 based on the above observations we propose a simple conceptual model of how microbial behavior influences an hab event fig 6 firstly microbial communities respond dynamically to an hab which in turn shapes community structure secondly in response to an hab microbial genes involved in key n cycling processes e g nirs k for denitrification nirb and nrfa for nitrate and nitrite reduction respectively and urec for ammonium oxidation are enhanced these are linked to other nutrient cycling pathways including c degradation and fixation s cycling sulfite oxidation and dmsp production and p metabolism whose key genes are largely derived from microorganisms with diverse physiological and metabolic features alterations in key functional processes are reflected in the increased metabolic versatility and availability of electron acceptors donors e g fe metabolism related molecules thus microbial behavior at different bloom stages facilitates the initiation maintenance and collapse of habs however one important point needs to note that there are still many challenges in linking microbiome changes to algal bloom event directly particularly in complex cycles and without accounting for intermediate mechanistic steps hall et al 2018 more comprehensive monitoring of microbial community dynamics along with physical chemical and biological analyses of ecosystem properties and functions is needed to clarify the precise contribution of microbes to habs 5 conclusions the results of our study support our hypotheses and provide potential novel insight into how changes in microbial community structure and function influence hab fate the microbial population initially contributed to fe acquisition oxidation and transport in the middle phase to c fixation and degradation as well as n and p uptake and in the late phase to s cycling secondary metabolite production and environmental stress response proteobacteria were the primary mediators of c and n metabolism fcb acidobacter and actinobacter participated in s p cycling and bacterodidetes were the major regulators of fe cycling additionally some bacteria had a broad metabolic spectrum and exhibited functional complementation although recent work has revealed partial correlations between phylogenetic diversity and functional profiles there may not always be a clear relationship between functional features and specific species due to functional redundancy across taxa rillig et al 2015 which uncouples ecological attributes from phylogeny barberan et al 2014 furthermore these findings are based on eight metagenomics in an algal bloom event which consists of a limited dataset for statistical analyses and are needed to be further tested with more hab samples therefore future studies that increasing the sample size and using new technologies such as stable isotope probing nanosims imaging and omics approaches to more precisely target specific biogeochemical processes are essential

17746,capacitive deionization cdi is an electrochemical method of removing salt ions from brackish water a common assumption in cdi is that monovalent ions e g na cl are removed in a 1 1 symmetry on the electrodes validation of this assumption with techniques such as ion chromatography is not commonly performed but is important to better understand how parasitic process such as faradaic reactions affect ion removals in this study we quantified the removals of na and cl as a function of electrode orientation in flow through cdi when the cathode was positioned upstream na and cl removals approached a 1 1 symmetry but when the anode was located upstream we observed a significant drop in na but not cl removals we attributed this drop to oxygen reduction reactions at the cathode that competed with na adsorption oxidation of carbon in the upstream anode yielded h that enhanced the reduction of oxygen to h2o2 at the downstream cathode which in turn diverted electrons from na adsorption in the absence of oxygen na removals increased in the upstream anode orientation and were comparable to cl removals confirming that competition with oxygen reduction reactions was the primary reason for decreased na removal in the upstream cathode orientation we show that h2o2 generated at the cathode can be oxidized at the downstream anode possibly enhancing na removals via internal electron recycling salt adsorption capacities calculated using actual ion removals did not always agree with those estimated using changes in solution conductivity with the largest disagreement observed when conductivity data were corrected for ph changes our results highlight that faradaic reactions particularly oxygen reduction reactions can contribute to asymmetrical removals of monovalent ions in flow through cdi graphical abstract image 1 keywords desalination capacitive deionization faradaic reactions 1 introduction there is a growing need for technologies that can increase fresh water supply from widely available brackish water resources located in coastal and inland environments ang et al 2015 gude 2016 2017 subramani and jacangelo 2015 capacitive deionization cdi is a promising desalination technology because of its low energy consumption and selectivity for ions hemmatifar et al 2016 kalfa et al 2020 mubita et al 2019 qu et al 2016 ramachandran et al 2019 suss et al 2015 xing et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 cdi has been also employed for a variety of applications such as water purification water disinfection resource recovery and energy harvesting xing et al 2020 in cdi a voltage or current is applied across a pair of capacitive electrodes typically porous activated carbon ac and ions e g na cl from the feed water are removed via storage within electrical double layers the adsorbed species are released back into the water and collected as a brine when the electrodes are short circuited or their polarity reversed ahualli et al 2017 cohen et al 2015 one of the main limitations of cdi using ac electrodes is the occurrence of parasitic losses driven by faradaic reactions these reactions can occur when oxygen present in the feed water is reduced at the cathode or when carbon in the anode becomes oxidized avraham et al 2010 bouhadana et al 2011 choi 2014 cohen et al 2013 he et al 2016 holubowitch et al 2017 2019 kim et al 2016 shapira et al 2016 tang et al 2017 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 2019 they are detrimental to cdi performance because they divert electrons from capacitive current i e ion removal and increase energy consumption the impact of faradaic reactions on cdi performance is typically evaluated based on calculations of charge efficiency which is defined as the ratio of adsorbed salt to electric charge low charge efficiencies occur when a large amount of charge in the system goes towards driving faradaic reactions instead of adsorbing salt ions to calculate charge efficiency and other performance metrics e g salt adsorption capacity sac the amount of salt removed is commonly determined based on changes between the influent and effluent solution conductivities during the charging phase agartan et al 2018 gao et al 2016 guyes et al 2019 krÃ¼ner et al 2017 porada et al 2013 in the case of nacl this approach assumes a 1 1 symmetrical removal of na and cl which inherently implies that faradaic reactions would affect the removal of both ions equally bouhadana et al 2011b suss et al 2015 several studies have hypothesized that na and cl may be removed asymmetrically but to the best of our knowledge no prior study has provided direct evidence for asymmetrical removals andres and yoshihara 2016 han et al 2013 tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 based on effluent conductivity and ph measurements holubowitch et al 2017 hypothesized that faradaic reactions could lead to less na removal than cl if na adsorption competed with reduction reactions at the cathode however without validation of na and cl removals using techniques such as an ion chromatography ic or ion selective electrodes it is challenging to quantify the effect of faradaic reactions on the removal of individual ions and conclude asymmetrical removals are occurring answering this question is important so that the accuracy of performance metrics such as sac can be improved and strategies developed to mitigate the negative effects of faradaic reactions the occurrence and extent of faradaic reactions can depend on cdi system architecture tang et al 2019 in flow by fb cdi flow is directed parallel to the electrodes ahualli et al 2017 tang et al 2017 yan et al 2018 in flow through ft cdi the flow is transported through or perpendicular to the electrodes bouhadana et al 2011b cohen et al 2015 guyes et al 2017 suss et al 2012 several advantages of ft cdi relative to fb cdi include lower resistance due to reduced spacer thickness requirements and enhanced mass transfer of ions to the electrodes cohen et al 2013 remillard et al 2018 suss et al 2012 tang et al 2019 despite these advantages ft cdi typically yields lower charge efficiencies and sac than fb cdi remillard et al 2018 additionally faradaic reactions have been reported to occur more readily in ft cdi than fb cdi remillard et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 ft cdi is unique relative to fb cdi because it is asymmetrical with respect to electrode orientation i e the cathode or anode can be the upstream electrode holubowitch et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 thus it is likely that any asymmetry in salt removal driven by faradaic reactions will be more pronounced in ft cdi than in fb cdi the overall objective of our work was to determine the effect of faradaic reactions on the symmetry of na and cl removal in ft cdi we selected a ft cdi design because of the asymmetrical nature of the electrode orientation and because it enabled us to study how electrode orientation impacts the synergistic effects of faradaic reactions on na and cl removals we examined two configurations water directed from cathode to anode upstream cathode uc and water directed from anode to cathode upstream anode ua the removals of na and cl were quantified using an ic and the impact of faradaic reactions quantified by recording effluent ph dissolved oxygen do and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 generation we found that oxygen reduction reactions can significantly impact na removals but that the magnitude of the impact is dependent on the electrode orientation in ft cdi these results have implications for calculating cdi performance metrics based on conductivity changes and for developing new approaches to minimize the impact of faradaic reactions 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and experimental setup the cdi cell contained two commercially available ac cloth electrodes acc 5092 15 nippon kynol japan each with a surface area of 1478 m2 g 1 and mass of 0 20 0 01 g cohen et al 2015 kim et al 2017 the electrodes were separated by a 25 Î¼m thick porous polypropylene spacer 3501 celgard usa to prevent short circuiting fig s1a graphite plate current collectors with dimensions of 5 5 0 1 cm3 and a 3 cm diameter hole to permit water flow were fabricated with a laser cutter and compressed against the acc electrodes when the cell was fully assembled polypropylene plastic sheets with the same dimensions as the graphite sheet were laser cut to serve as upstream and downstream reservoirs permitting the feedwater to pass evenly through the electrodes to measure the anode and cathode half cell potentials two ag agcl reference electrodes 200 mv versus standard hydrogen electrode she low profile silver silver chloride reference electrode pine research usa were installed in the center of each of the reservoirs neoprene rubber gaskets with dimensions of 5 5 0 015 cm3 were laser cut and inserted between the graphite plates and plastic end plates to seal the cell a glass flow through cell was installed 5 cm downstream from the cdi cell to permit continuous measurements of effluent ph semi micro orion ph electrode thermo fisher usa conductivity orion duraprobe conductivity thermo fisher usa and do neofox kit probe oceanoptics usa every minute during the charging and discharging phases 2 2 cdi operation the feed solution consisting of nacl 10 mm 99 pure sigma aldrich usa in deionized water 18 2 Î¼Ï was continuously pumped 3 ml min 1 using a peristaltic pump masterflex cole parmer usa through the cdi cell into the glass flow through cell and collected as needed for further analysis fig s1b before applying a voltage the cell was continuously flushed with the feed solution overnight in open circuit voltage ocv to reach a pseudo equilibrium state with respect to physical adsorption of nacl to the acc a potentiostat vmp3 biologic france was used to apply a whole cell potential of v cell 1 2 v between the electrodes for the charging phase 30 min during the discharge phase the potential was fixed to 0 v for another 30 min to regenerate the electrodes in order to reduce the effects of electrode changes over time and irreversible ion adsorption we used new electrodes for each set of tests we did not consider the first run in cycle after reassembling our cells but rather reported the average and standard deviation of the final three cycles porada et al 2013 this approach helped minimize any variability caused by reassembling the cell in tests where do was removed we continuously purged the influent solution with nitrogen gas ultra high purity nitrogen airgas usa preliminary tests showed that a flow rate of 3 ml min 1 was insufficient to keep the effluent do below 0 18 0 06 mg l 1 so the flowrate was increased to 7 ml min 1 since all other tests when oxygen was present were performed at 3 ml min 1 we conducted an additional set of tests at 7 ml min 1 in the presence of do to ensure that the higher flowrate did not impact our ph conductivity and do trends fig s2 effluent samples were collected either over time multi point sampling or from the entire charging phase single point sampling and analyzed for na and cl concentrations comparison and validation of these two approaches are shown in fig s3 in tests to determine if h2o2 could be oxidized in the ft cdi cells we added h2o2 65 Î¼m working concentration sigma aldrich usa to the influent nacl feed solution when the ft cdi cell was tested under acidic ph we added hydrochloric acid to reach the targeted influent ph 5 1 2 3 analytical tools to quantify na and cl concentrations we used two different ics one for cations ics 2000 thermo fisher usa and a second for anions ics 5000 thermo fisher usa both ics were calibrated using na and cl solution standards environmental express usa we validated the smallest detectable changes among our samples using quality controls prepared from na and cl standards obtained from a second source inorganic ventures usa to ensure that changes in na and cl ions within our samples were detectable and not within the error of the ics we developed a method for which the minimum reporting limits of the cation and anion ics were 180 and 280 mg l 1 respectively the effluent concentrations of h2o2 during the adsorption and desorption phases were measured using the i3 method summarized elsewhere monge 2011 this method was selected because its minimum detection level 1 Î¼m was suitable for the range of expected h2o2 concentrations in our study 2 4 cdi metrics and theoretical electrode potentials to determine salt adsorption two metrics were used 1 sac and 2 ion adsorption capacity iac sac is the ratio of total salt adsorbed to the total mass of electrodes and iac is the ratio of the adsorption of an individual ion i e na or cl to the total mass of electrodes eq 1 1 sac or iac q c 0 c t d t m where q ml min 1 is the flowrate c 0 and c t are the influent and effluent salt concentration mg l 1 at time t min respectively for sac mg g 1 or the influent and effluent ion concentration Î¼mol l 1 at time t min respectively for iac Î¼mol g 1 and m g is the total mass of both electrodes sac describes the total salt removal capacity and was calculated based on either conductivity or ic values while the iac is based on individual ion concentrations and could only be obtained from ic data in cases when we observed large ph fluctuations in the effluent we excluded subtracted the contributions of h or oh to the measured conductivity in order to obtain a corrected conductivity reflecting only na and cl eq 2 holubowitch et al 2017 lee et al 2018 2 Ð± nacl Ð± meas Ð± ph where Ð± nacl is the nacl conductivity after ph correction Ð± meas is the measured raw conductivity and Ð± ph is the conductivity of water due to the ph changes which was obtained by eq 3 holubowitch et al 2017 3 Ð± ph 10 p h Î» h 10 14 p h Î» oh where Î» h and Î» oh are the proton and hydroxide molar conductivities Î¼s cm2 mol 1 respectively conductivity Î¼s cm 1 was then converted to nacl concentration mm using a conductivity concentration calibration curve for nacl in a range of 0 15 mm charge efficiency Î» which is the ratio of total salt removed to the total charge passing through the cell as current was calculated as 4 Î» q f c 0 c t d t m i t d t where f is the faraday constant 96 485 c mol 1 m is the molecular weight of nacl 58 5 g mol 1 and i t is current a at time t sec charge efficiency provides an indication of how well electrical current passing through the cell assists in the removal of ions versus driving other processes such as faradaic reactions it is also related to energy consumption a higher Î» translates into less energy consumed suss et al 2015 we calculated energy consumption normalized to mol of ions removed during the adsorption phase e ads by eq 5 zhao et al 2013 5 e ads j mol 1 v cell i t dt q c 0 c t dt where v cell is the applied voltage 1 2 v in our study e ads is often expressed as kt ion in the cdi literature to represent the energy demand per ion removed to find that normalized value we divided eq 5 by rt 2 48 kj mol 1 at room temperature zhao et al 2012 to assess the favorability of faradaic reactions in our ft cdi cells we calculated the theoretical potentials for several possible reactions under actual conditions of ph h2o2 and do measured in our cells eq 6 and compared them to the measured electrode potentials using 6 e e r t n f l n r e o x where e and e o v are the theoretical electrode potentials under actual and standard conditions respectively r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 t is the temperature in kelvin n is the number of electrons transferred re is the activity of reduced species and ox is the activity of oxidized species since the nacl concentration in this work was relatively low 10 mm we assumed activity coefficients of one for all species 3 results and discussion 3 1 na and cl removals in the presence of oxygen we first examined na and cl removals during the charging cycle upon applying a voltage na and cl concentrations in the effluent of the uc orientation dropped sharply and then slowly increased toward the influent concentration fig 1 a the difference between the na and cl concentrations at each time point was within the error of the ic method indicating that na and cl removals were approaching a 1 1 symmetry to confirm this observation we summed the total mass of na and cl removed comparable amounts of na and cl were removed 107 8 3 6 Î¼mol na g c and 126 5 4 9 Î¼mol cl g c after the 30 min charging phase was complete fig 1c although less na was removed than cl the difference was not significant p 0 06 thus the removal of ions in the uc orientation approached a 1 1 symmetry in the ua orientation cl but not na removal followed a similar trend as in the uc orientation at all time points na concentrations were greater than cl fig 1b this difference persisted throughout the entire charging phase at several time points na concentrations exceeded the influent value including near the beginning 2 min and from about 22 min until the end of the cycle the release of na at the beginning of charging which is consistent with prior reports of inversion peaks might be attributed to co ion expulsion ahualli et al 2017 bouhadana et al 2011a cohen et al 2015 omosebi et al 2014 this peak was unique to na in the ua orientation suggesting that the orientation of that cell led to changes on the electrode that did not occur in the uc orientation potential causes of this inversion peak are discussed below in the sections on faradaic reactions by the end of the charging phase 59 5 14 5 Î¼mol na g c and 143 5 7 9 Î¼mol cl g c were removed which based on statistical analysis were found to be significantly different p 0 05 while na removals were strongly dependent on electrode orientation p 0 05 cl removals were not indicating that the difference in na removals was independent of cl removal we measured na and cl recoveries during the discharge phase in each orientation although the removal of ions was approaching 1 1 symmetry in the uc configuration during charging the recovery of cl during discharging was lower than na 109 9 4 1 Î¼mol na g c and 85 3 14 2 Î¼mol cl g c fig s4a in the ua configuration the desorption results were consistent with the lower na removal observed during charging 74 9 15 7 Î¼mol na g c and 122 6 2 1 Î¼mol cl g c fig s4b collectively these charging and discharging results show that less na was removed in the ua orientation the charge efficiency and energy consumption were also dependent on electrode orientation the uc orientation which had a larger salt removal had a 38 1 1 4 larger charge efficiency 51 1 1 6 and 26 7 2 6 decrease in energy consumption 46 1 kt ion relative to the ua orientation the larger charge efficiency of the uc orientation supports our findings above that faradaic reactions occurred to a lesser extent than in the ua configuration 3 2 dissolved oxygen profiles since our ic results indicated that na removals were affected by electrode orientation we explored possible o2 driven cathodic reactions that may have competed with and decreased na adsorption we first measured effluent do concentrations during the charging and discharging cycles the effluent do concentrations in both orientations decreased during charging but the kinetics and extent of do consumption were orientation dependent fig 2 a in the uc orientation the do concentrations decreased slowly from 8 12 0 34 to around 3 73 0 25 mg l 1 and did not plateau the do concentrations in the ua orientation dropped much faster and nearly leveled reaching 1 28 0 04 mg l 1 within 14 min of the charging phase during discharging the do concentrations in the ua orientation converged back to the do of the influent 8 45 0 2 mg l 1 in the uc orientation the effluent do concentration did not reach the influent concentration within the 30 min discharge phase there are two possible mechanisms that can explain the do trend in the uc orientation during the discharging phase first less do was consumed in that orientation during charging a smaller do gradient would translate into a slower rate of o2 transfer because the deficit difference between do at saturation and actual do is smaller second the anode which was located downstream from the cathode may have provided an additional barrier to do transport prior to exiting the cell to test this hypothesis we operated the uc cell at a higher flow rate 7 ml min 1 instead of 3 ml min 1 not only did the effluent do levels approach saturation within 10 min of discharging fig s5 they also stabilized more quickly during the charging phase those results suggest that the dynamics of do consumption and regeneration were different in the two configurations 3 3 oxygen reduction reactions the decrease of do in both orientations may have been due to several cathode driven o2 reduction reactions orrs holubowitch et al 2019 shapira et al 2016 in a two electron transfer process o2 can be reduced to form h2o2 eq 7 and in a four electron pathway it can generate oh and or h2o eqs 8 and 9 7 o â 2 h 2

theoretical potentials i e standard reduction potentials adjusted for actual conditions via eq 6 for an oxidation reduction reaction to be thermodynamically favorable the measured potential needs to be more less positive than the theoretical value based on the measured cathode potentials and theoretical predictions for the ua orientation we assumed that the effluent ph measured in the uc orientation was identical to the ph coming in contact with the cathode in the ua orientation we determined that eqs 7 9 were thermodynamically favorable in our cells fig s6 3 3 1 oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide to validate the occurrence of eq 7 we measured effluent h2o2 concentrations over time during the charging and discharging phases at the end of the charging phase 68 8 0 2 and 12 3 0 6 Î¼m h2o2 were measured in the ua and the uc orientations respectively which translates into a factor of 5 5 increase in h2o2 generation in the ua orientation fig 2b during discharging h2o2 concentrations in both orientations decreased toward zero demonstrating that an applied voltage was required to drive h2o2 generation there are two possible explanations for the differences in h2o2 generation between the two orientations first conditions in the ua orientation may have been more favorable for h2o2 production according to eq 7 h2o2 generation is dependent on the concentration of do and h assuming that do concentrations reaching the cathode in both orientations were the same as measured in the influent i e no do loss at the anode in the ua orientation h would limit h2o2 production in this situation increasing h should increase h2o2 production oxidation of carbon at the anode is one faradaic reaction that could increase h according to eq 10 10 1 4 c 1 2 h â o 1 4 co â h e e 0 7 0 9 v she based on comparison of the anode potentials measured during the charging phase fig s7 and the theoretical potential for carbon oxidation this reaction was favorable during the entire 30 min for both orientations to determine if anode oxidation in the ua orientation generated h that enhanced h2o2 generation at the downstream cathode we measured the effluent ph in both orientations fig 3 during charging the influent ph remained constant at 6 0 0 1 we observed substantial differences in effluent ph between the two orientations in the uc orientation the effluent ph became acidic decreasing to 4 3 0 1 after 10 min of charging and then remained approximately constant at 3 7 0 2 for the rest of the charging phase the sharp drop in ph strongly suggests that carbon in the downstream anode was undergoing oxidation assuming the same ph drop occurred across the anode in the ua orientation the solution coming in contact with the downstream cathode would have an approximately 50 fold greater h concentration relative to the influent after 10 min of charging and 200 fold greater in the last 20 min of the cycle in the uc orientation the anode was located downstream h generated at the anode would transport away from the cathode due to the direction of flow and not enhance h2o2 generation to validate that the cathode was h limited in the uc orientation we conducted an additional test in which we decreased the influent ph from 6 0 0 1 to 5 1 0 2 using 1 m hcl the effluent h2o2 concentration in that test doubled compared to the test where the ph was neutral confirming h was a primary driver of h2o2 in the ft cdi cell fig s8 a second explanation for the lower h2o2 concentrations in the uc orientation is that h2o2 was oxidized when it came in contact with the downstream anode prior studies have suggested but not proven that h2o2 oxidation to o2 at the anode reverse of eq 7 may occur in cdi holubowitch et al 2019 based on our measured anode potentials in the uc orientation h2o2 oxidation was thermodynamically favorable fig s9 to determine if h2o2 oxidation was occurring we conducted an additional test in which 65 Î¼m h2o2 was amended to a n2 gas purged influent removing o2 allowed us to better quantify h2o2 oxidation and o2 generation during the charging cycle the influent h2o2 concentration remained constant at 65 3 0 9 Î¼m the effluent h2o2 concentration dropped sharply in the first 2 min to 26 6 1 6 Î¼m and then leveled at 17 7 0 4 Î¼m fig 4 the consumption of h2o2 was accompanied by production of o2 effluent do concentrations increased rapidly from an initial value of 0 22 0 08 mg l 1 to 1 27 0 04 mg l 1 within 2 min of charging fig 4 these measurements provide strong evidence that the lower effluent h2o2 concentrations and higher do concentrations recorded in the uc orientation under aerobic conditions may have been attributed to h2o2 oxidation at the downstream anode h2o2 oxidation was unlikely in the ua orientation because h2o2 generated at the downstream cathode in that orientation would be transported away from the anode 3 3 2 four electron oxygen reduction pathways to determine the contribution of the four electron pathway orrs eqs 8 and 9 to the observed differences in na removal we first conducted a do balance in each orientation we confirmed that prior to applying a voltage the effluent and influent do concentrations were in agreement fig 5 t 0 min once we applied a voltage we accounted for the do consumed to generate h2o2 in both orientations by converting our measured effluent h2o2 concentrations fig 2b into an equivalent amount of do based on eq 7 do h2o2 we combined that amount of do with the do measured in the effluent do effluent if all of the do consumed during charging fig 2a was associated with h2o2 generation the combined value would equal the influent do value in both orientations the combined and influent values did not agree indicating that other reactions consumed do in the cells do other fig 5 the magnitude of the disagreement was dependent on orientation in the ua orientation there was a larger amount of do that couldn t be accounted for than in the uc orientation one explanation for the unaccounted do in the ua orientation is that the four electron orrs were occurring to a greater extent in that orientation support for this hypothesis is the appreciable increase in effluent ph of the ua orientation during charging fig 3 the effluent ph initially dropped from 6 0 to 5 0 0 1 but then increased sharply to peak at 9 7 0 2 and remained around 9 5 0 1 for the remainder of the charging phase this ph change is consistent with oh generation eq 8 or h consumption eq 9 alternatively the basic ph could be attributed to generation of h2o2 which consumes h via eq 7 at the downstream cathode when we predicted the increase in effluent ph associated with only h2o2 generation predicted ph h2o2 in fig s10 calculated assuming the effluent ph in the uc orientation ph 3 7 was the same as the ph coming into contact with the downstream cathode in the ua orientation the ph did not agree with the measured ph in the effluent however when we assumed that the unaccounted do do other in fig 5 was reduced to oh and or h2o the predicted ph predicted ph orr in fig s10 became basic this trend was consistent with the measured ph values the predicted ph values were larger than the measured values possibly due to our assumption that the ph coming into contact with the cathode was around 3 7 the actual ph may have been lower than this assumption for example holubowitch et al 2017 reported a ph of 2 5 near the anode due to carbon oxidation when we assumed a ph of 2 5 the predicted ph orr and measured values were in much better agreement in short these results indicate that both the two and four electron orr pathways occurred to a greater extent in the ua orientation relative to the uc configuration 3 4 cdi operation in the absence of oxygen 3 4 1 na and cl removals our results above strongly suggest that orrs at the cathode were contributing to the decreased removal of na in the ua orientation in the absence of o2 this effect should disappear and equal amounts of na and cl removed to test this hypothesis we conducted additional experiments while continuously purging the influent with n2 gas during the tests the do concentrations remained below 0 18 0 06 mg l 1 in the influent in the uc orientation the amount of na and cl removed was similar by the end of the charging cycle 134 6 26 9 Î¼mol na g c and 125 1 25 1 Î¼mol cl g c were removed fig 6 a these removals were not significantly different than those recorded when o2 was present p 0 05 in the ua orientation na removal increased sharply in the absence of o2 reaching 143 3 15 7 Î¼mol na g c fig 6a this was a significant increase compared to the 59 5 14 5 Î¼mol na g c removed in the presence of o2 p 0 05 the cl removals were very comparable in the presence versus absence of o2 in the absence of o2 cl removal reached 152 6 24 1 Î¼mol cl g c which was slightly larger than when o2 was present 143 5 7 9 Î¼mol cl g c but not significantly different p 0 05 the symmetry of na and cl removal in the ua orientation therefore improved when o2 was removed from the system our results also suggest that when o2 is not present the effect of electrode orientation in ft cdi becomes minimal because orrs are eliminated this can be seen from the accumulated charge curves in our cells fig s11 the ua orientation resulted in a sharper increase in the accumulated charges when tested with o2 because of a greater consumption in charge towards faradaic reactions orrs and or carbon oxidation compared to the uc orientation both orientations showed a similar cumulative charge behavior during the charging and discharging cycles in the absence of o2 as a result both orientations under anaerobic conditions yielded a near symmetrical removal of na and cl 3 4 2 effluent ph profiles we also monitored the effluent ph in the absence of o2 to determine if similar ph profiles as we observed with o2 would occur with o2 absent electrode oxidation would be the primary faradaic reaction occurring in our system eq 10 since carbon oxidation is an anode driven process we expected that the effluent ph profile would follow the same trend under anaerobic and aerobic conditions when the anode was positioned downstream when we purged the influent with n2 gas the effluent ph in the uc orientation dropped during charging to 4 5 0 5 and then increased during discharging to the influent ph value fig 6b supporting the occurrence of anode oxidation this trend was consistent with the ph profile when o2 was present except that the effluent ph was lower in the presence of o2 two possible reasons for the lower ph under aerobic conditions are 1 h were generated during the oxidation of h2o2 at the downstream anode and 2 the presence of o2 shifted the distribution of the applied voltage towards anode potentials that enabled greater carbon oxidation cohen et al 2015 omosebi et al 2014 in the ua orientation the effluent ph profile was much different when o2 was absent rather than increasing the ph slowly decreased over the charging cycle reaching a final value of 5 5 0 1 fig 6b the change in effluent ph profile was due to the lack of o2 driven consumption generation of h oh instead the slow decrease in ph was likely a result of h generated from oxidation of the upstream anode the ph did not drop as quickly as in the uc orientation because some h produced at the anode were likely adsorbed at the downstream cathode the drop in effluent ph to 4 7 0 2 in the first 5 min of discharging supports our hypothesis that h were adsorbed onto the cathode during the charging phase and is consistent with the ph measured during discharging under aerobic conditions fig 3 since na removals were nearly identical in the uc and ua orientations in the absence of o2 h adsorption does not appear to be a strong competitor with na for adsorption sites during charging we did not expect a competitive effect because h concentrations were several orders of magnitude lower than na in both orientations 50 times lower at ph 3 7 in the ua cell and 10 000 times lower at ph 6 0 in the uc variation in effluent ph in ft cdi has previously been attributed to differences in diffusion coefficients of h and oh and or water dissociation dykstra et al 2017 tang et al 2017 h has a higher mobility than oh 9 13 10 9 and 5 16 10 9 m2 s 1 respectively atkins and de paula 2006 h may therefore more readily transport into electrode micropores of opposite charge than oh resulting in an excess of oh in solution he et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 regarding water dissociation zhang et al 2019 hypothesized that when cl adsorbed in the upstream electrode in the ua orientation h generated from water dissociation near the downstream electrode was adsorbed at the cathode resulting in a basic ph in the effluent our results suggest that these two non faradaic processes were not the main driver of ph changes in our ft cdi cells if these processes were predominant their effect should be independent of o2 in the absence of o2 we observed a dramatic shift in effluent ph from basic to acidic in the ua orientation during charging if differences in diffusion of h and oh and or water dissociation resulting in adsorption of h at the downstream cathode and release of oh into the effluent were predominate then we would expect similar ph profiles and na removals in the presence and absence of o2 our results showing a decrease in effluent ph in the absence of o2 indicate that faradaic reactions involving h oh consumption generation were the primary drivers of ph changes the ph dependence in o2 environment was also reported by bouhadana et al 2011b a much smaller ph variation was observed in their ft cdi system when o2 was removed further confirming the dependence of ph changes on o2 driven reactions and supporting our results nevertheless further elucidating the contribution of these non faradaic processes on ph fluctuations is warranted 3 5 salt adsorption capacity determining accurate values of sac is important for benchmarking cdi technologies we determined if asymmetrical salt removals impacted calculations of sac in our ft cdi cells the traditional approach to calculate sac is to estimate total salt removal based on changes in solution conductivity fig s12 but in the case of monovalent ions this approach is based on the assumption of a 1 1 symmetrical removal of anions and cations suss et al 2015 when we used that approach without correcting for ph we obtained a sac of 6 53 0 16 and 4 63 0 19 mg g c 1 in the uc and ua orientations respectively when we considered the actual ion concentrations based on our ic data of samples taken at the same time as the conductivity readings we calculated the sac as 6 97 0 17 and 6 46 0 61 mg g c 1 in the uc and ua orientations respectively while the conductivity and ic based sac values for the uc orientation were similar the sac was 39 3 11 5 larger when the actual ion composition was determined for the ua configuration this result is in contrast with the near identical sac values based on actual ion concentrations and conductivity changes reported by srimuk et al 2018 however in that study they removed do our system where do was present suggests that orrs and carbon oxidation were primary reasons for the discrepancy between sac values adjusting conductivity readings to account for changes in ph is a common practice when calculating sac holubowitch et al 2017 lado et al 2014 lee et al 2018 li and park 2018 tang et al 2017 when we used this approach we observed a difference between conductivity and ic based predictions of sac the sac for the ua orientation when recalculated based on a ph corrected solution conductivity eqs 2 and 3 increased from 4 63 0 19 to 5 28 0 20 mg g c 1 when this correction was applied to the uc orientation the contribution of water conductivity was more significant due to the larger number of h generated in the effluent this resulted in a corrected value of 10 65 0 19 mg g c 1 which was almost double the actual removal 6 97 0 17 mg g c 1 this result highlights that ph corrected conductivities might not reflect the true sac of a system especially when do is present further research is needed to better understand the relationships between ph fluctuations conductivity and actual salt removals so that the accuracy of sac values can be ensured 3 6 mechanisms driving asymmetrical salt removal in flow through cdi towards understanding a mechanistic explanation for asymmetrical salt removal in ft cdi we developed two conceptual models based on our experimental results one for each electrode orientation overall the primary difference between the orientations is the extent to which orrs occur in the system this in turn influences na removal at the cathode in the uc orientation fig 7 a there was less competition between na and the orrs for electrons generated at the anode since the ph of the influent as it flowed into the cathode was near neutral h2o2 generation which was h dependent was limited our tests in which h2o2 concentrations increased when we lowered the influent ph confirmed that h was limiting the reaction h generated at the anode due to carbon oxidation that could have enhanced h2o2 generation were transported away from the cathode due to the direction of flow through the cell removing o2 in the uc orientation did not significantly change na removals compared to when o2 was present p 0 23 further confirming minimal competition for electrons between na and the orrs in the ua orientation na removals decreased because orrs at the cathode were enhanced fig 7b the production of h2o2 became more favorable in this orientation because the concentration of h flowing into the cathode was larger the h originating from oxidation of the upstream anode were consumed during orrs and or adsorbed to the cathode support for the latter was provided by the sharp drop in ph during discharging in the ua orientation competition of h with na was unlikely a major driver of the na removal differences because h was always present at concentrations much lower than na in both orientations the adsorption of cl was not limited by na adsorption in the two orientations when na removals increased either by purging with n2 gas or positioning the cathode as the upstream electrode the removal of cl did not change significantly the primary faradaic reaction occurring at the anode was likely carbon oxidation it may be possible that carbon oxidation did not exert a competitive effect with cl because of the relatively short duration of our tests gao et al 2016 suggested that cl removal would not vary for short term tests because the competitive effect of carbon oxidation would not become pronounced until long term operation alternative explanations for asymmetrical salt removal in cdi have included differences in ion mobility and or surface complexation bouhadana et al 2011b tang et al 2017 kalluri et al 2013 reported that the hydrated radius of an ion can impact adsorption using activated carbon electrodes with micropores of various widths 0 65 1 6 nm which were comparable in size to hydrated cl and na they observed less cl adsorption than na they attributed differences in removal to the larger hydrated radius of cl ca 0 36 nm for cl and 0 33 nm for na differences in hydrated radii likely did not play a major role in our observed asymmetrical ion removals because 1 a previous study using the same electrode material as this study confirmed that the pores were large enough to not have an effect on the adsorption symmetry of na and cl avraham et al 2008 and 2 asymmetry driven by differences in hydrated radii should be independent of electrode orientation and presence absence of o2 since we observed improved symmetry of na and cl removal in either the uc orientation or the absence of o2 in the ua orientation our results do not support the hypothesis that differences in hydrated radii were the main drivers of asymmetry one way that o2 based faradaic reactions could have caused lower na removals in the ua orientation is that the point of zero charge of the anode e pzc shifted to more positive values e pzc is a fundamental material property of the electrical double layer interface for capacitive charge ion storage bouhadana et al 2011a cohen et al 2013 gao et al 2015 two identical electrodes will initially have the same e pzc under an applied voltage the cathode and anode e pzc may shift depending on the length of operation do concentration and extent of faradaic reactions omosebi et al 2014 shapira et al 2016 omosebi et al 2014 showed that after 50 cycles 1 h each of operation in the presence of do the anode e pzc shifted form ca 0 1to 0 4 v while the cathode e pzc remained nearly identical with or without do the authors attributed the positive shift in anode e pzc to the redox couple between cathodic orrs and anodic carbon oxidation that formed oxidative groups on the anode surface they reported that the positive e pzc shift resulted in an inversion peak during charging caused by co ion expulsion from the anode based on this understanding of e pzc we expect that the larger do concentrations coming into contact with the anode coupled with greater orrs at the cathode in the ua orientation likely caused a shift to more positive e pzc potentials at the anode in the uc orientation the anode e pzc was likely more stable because the do concentrations at the downstream anode were lower due to do consumption at the upstream cathode and faradaic reactions were less favorable our observation of a na but not cl inversion peak at the start of the charging cycle fig 1b in the ua orientation is consistent with increased expulsion of co ions due to a more positive e pzc at the anode we did not observe this inversion behavior in the uc orientation which suggests that the anode e pzc was more stable to summarize we hypothesize that the greater degree of faradaic reactions in the ua orientation may have increased the anode e pzc to more positive values which in turn contributed to asymmetrical ion removals in that orientation further support for this hypothesis is the improved symmetry of na and cl removal in the absence of o2 in the ua orientation one interesting hypothesis that our findings raise is the role of h2o2 oxidation on the removal of na at the cathode it is plausible that electrons obtained from h2o2 oxidation at a downstream anode contributed to upstream na adsorption analogous to asymmetrical cdi systems using one capacitive and one faradaic electrode lee et al 2014 internal recycling of electrons in this manner may be part of the reason why na removals improved in the uc orientation but further research on this pathway is needed to validate its contribution 4 conclusions in this study we measured the removals of na and cl as a function of electrode orientation in flow through capacitive deionization ft cdi we quantified ion removals using ion chromatography ic and determined the occurrence of oxygen reduction reactions orrs based on measurements of ph dissolved oxygen do and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the following points summarize our major findings when the cathode was placed upstream upstream cathode uc the removals of na and cl approached a 1 1 symmetry placing the anode upstream upstream anode ua however resulted in almost 2 5 times less na removed than cl between the uc and ua orientations cl removal remained nearly identical indicating that na was the main contributor to the asymmetry enhanced orrs were responsible for the decreased na removal in the ua orientation in the uc orientation do conversion to h2o2 at the cathode was h limited in the ua orientation h from the oxidation of carbon in the anode increased the orrs at the downstream cathode most notably the generation of h2o2 in the absence of o2 na and cl removals were nearly identical in the ua configuration confirming that orrs at the cathode were responsible for the decrease in na removal when o2 was present effluent ph profiles between the two orientations were dramatically different when o2 was present the uc orientation yielded an acidic ph 3 7 0 2 and the ua orientation produced a basic ph 9 7 0 2 during the charging phase in the absence of o2 both orientations yielded acidic effluents suggesting that the basic ph measured in the ua configuration under the aerobic experimental conditions was not due to oh generation from water dissociation salt adsorption capacities sacs calculated using actual na and cl concentrations based on ic measurements were 6 8 2 9 and 39 3 11 5 larger in the uc and ua orientations respectively compared to sacs calculated using changes in solution conductivity obtaining actual na and cl concentrations rather than using conductivity measurements is needed to improve the accuracy of sacs especially when large shifts in effluent ph are observed further investigation of ion removals as a function of salt concentration and type applied voltage current cdi configuration i e flow by and

17746,capacitive deionization cdi is an electrochemical method of removing salt ions from brackish water a common assumption in cdi is that monovalent ions e g na cl are removed in a 1 1 symmetry on the electrodes validation of this assumption with techniques such as ion chromatography is not commonly performed but is important to better understand how parasitic process such as faradaic reactions affect ion removals in this study we quantified the removals of na and cl as a function of electrode orientation in flow through cdi when the cathode was positioned upstream na and cl removals approached a 1 1 symmetry but when the anode was located upstream we observed a significant drop in na but not cl removals we attributed this drop to oxygen reduction reactions at the cathode that competed with na adsorption oxidation of carbon in the upstream anode yielded h that enhanced the reduction of oxygen to h2o2 at the downstream cathode which in turn diverted electrons from na adsorption in the absence of oxygen na removals increased in the upstream anode orientation and were comparable to cl removals confirming that competition with oxygen reduction reactions was the primary reason for decreased na removal in the upstream cathode orientation we show that h2o2 generated at the cathode can be oxidized at the downstream anode possibly enhancing na removals via internal electron recycling salt adsorption capacities calculated using actual ion removals did not always agree with those estimated using changes in solution conductivity with the largest disagreement observed when conductivity data were corrected for ph changes our results highlight that faradaic reactions particularly oxygen reduction reactions can contribute to asymmetrical removals

al 2020 in cdi a voltage or current is applied across a pair of capacitive electrodes typically porous activated carbon ac and ions e g na cl from the feed water are removed via storage within electrical double layers the adsorbed species are released back into the water and collected as a brine when the electrodes are short circuited or their polarity reversed ahualli et al 2017 cohen et al 2015 one of the main limitations of cdi using ac electrodes is the occurrence of parasitic losses driven by faradaic reactions these reactions can occur when oxygen present in the feed water is reduced at the cathode or when carbon in the anode becomes oxidized avraham et al 2010 bouhadana et al 2011 choi 2014 cohen et al 2013 he et al 2016 holubowitch et al 2017 2019 kim et al 2016 shapira

consumption the impact of faradaic reactions on cdi performance is typically evaluated based on calculations of charge efficiency which is defined as the ratio of adsorbed salt to electric charge low charge efficiencies occur when a large amount of charge in the system goes towards driving faradaic reactions instead of adsorbing salt ions to calculate charge efficiency and other performance metrics e g salt adsorption capacity sac the amount of salt removed is commonly determined based on changes between the influent and effluent solution conductivities during the charging phase agartan et al 2018 gao et al 2016 guyes et al 2019 krÃ¼ner et al 2017 porada et al 2013 in the case of nacl this approach assumes a 1 1 symmetrical removal of na and cl which inherently implies that faradaic reactions would affect the removal of both ions equally bouhadana et al 2011b suss et al 2015 several studies have hypothesized that na and cl may be removed asymmetrically but to the best of our knowledge no prior study has provided direct evidence for asymmetrical removals andres and yoshihara 2016 han et al 2013 tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 based on effluent conductivity and ph measurements holubowitch et al 2017 hypothesized that faradaic reactions could lead to less na removal than cl if na adsorption competed with reduction reactions at the cathode however without validation of na and cl removals using techniques such as an ion chromatography ic or ion selective electrodes it is challenging to quantify the effect of faradaic reactions on the removal of individual ions and conclude asymmetrical removals are occurring answering this question is important so that the accuracy of performance metrics such as sac can be improved and strategies developed to mitigate the negative effects of faradaic reactions the occurrence and extent of faradaic reactions can depend on cdi system architecture tang et al 2019 in flow by fb cdi flow is directed parallel to the electrodes ahualli et al 2017 tang et al 2017 yan et al 2018 in flow through ft cdi the flow is transported through or perpendicular to the electrodes bouhadana et al 2011b cohen et al 2015 guyes et al 2017 suss et al 2012 several advantages of ft cdi relative to fb cdi include lower resistance due to reduced spacer thickness requirements and enhanced mass transfer of ions to the electrodes cohen et al 2013 remillard et al 2018 suss et al 2012 tang et al 2019 despite these advantages ft cdi typically yields lower charge efficiencies and sac than fb cdi remillard et al 2018 additionally faradaic reactions have been reported to occur more readily in ft cdi than fb cdi remillard et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 ft cdi is unique relative to fb cdi because it is asymmetrical with respect to electrode orientation i e the cathode or anode can be the upstream electrode holubowitch et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 thus it is likely that any asymmetry in salt removal driven by faradaic reactions will be more pronounced in ft cdi than in fb cdi the overall objective of our work was to determine the effect of faradaic reactions on the symmetry of na and cl removal in ft cdi we selected a ft cdi design because of the asymmetrical nature of the electrode orientation and because it enabled us to study how electrode orientation impacts the synergistic effects of faradaic reactions on na and cl removals we examined two configurations water directed from cathode to anode upstream cathode uc and water directed from anode to cathode upstream anode ua the removals of na and cl were quantified using an ic and the impact of faradaic reactions quantified by recording effluent ph dissolved oxygen do and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 generation we found that oxygen reduction reactions can significantly impact na removals but that the magnitude of the impact is dependent on the electrode orientation in ft cdi these results have implications for calculating cdi performance

applying a voltage the cell was continuously flushed with the feed solution overnight in open circuit voltage ocv to reach a pseudo equilibrium state with respect to physical adsorption of nacl to the acc a potentiostat vmp3 biologic france was used to apply a whole cell potential of v cell 1 2 v between the electrodes for the charging phase 30 min during the discharge phase the potential was fixed to 0 v for another 30 min to regenerate the electrodes in order to reduce the effects of electrode changes over time and irreversible ion adsorption we used new electrodes for each set of tests we did not consider the first run in cycle after reassembling our cells but rather reported the average and standard deviation of the final three cycles porada et al 2013 this approach helped minimize any variability caused by reassembling the cell in tests where do was removed we continuously purged the influent solution with nitrogen gas ultra high purity nitrogen airgas usa preliminary tests showed that a flow rate of 3 ml min 1 was insufficient to keep the effluent do below 0 18 0 06 mg l 1 so the flowrate was increased to 7 ml min 1 since all other tests when oxygen was present were performed at 3 ml min 1 we conducted an additional set of tests at 7 ml min 1 in the presence of do to ensure that the higher flowrate did not impact our ph conductivity and do trends fig s2 effluent samples were collected either over time multi point sampling or from the entire charging phase single point sampling and analyzed for na and cl concentrations comparison and validation of these two approaches are shown in fig s3 in tests to determine if h2o2 could be oxidized in the ft cdi cells we added h2o2 65 Î¼m working concentration sigma aldrich usa to the influent nacl feed solution when the ft cdi cell was tested under acidic ph we added hydrochloric acid to reach the targeted influent ph 5 1 2 3 analytical tools to quantify na and cl concentrations we used two different ics one for cations ics 2000 thermo fisher usa and a second for anions ics 5000 thermo fisher usa both ics were calibrated using na and cl solution standards environmental express usa we validated the smallest detectable changes among our samples using quality controls prepared from na and cl standards obtained from a second source inorganic ventures usa to ensure that changes in na and cl ions within our samples were detectable and not within the error of the ics we developed a method for which the minimum reporting limits of the cation and anion ics were 180 and 280 mg l 1 respectively the effluent concentrations of h2o2 during the adsorption and desorption phases were measured using the i3 method summarized elsewhere monge 2011 this method was selected because its minimum detection level 1 Î¼m was suitable for the range of expected h2o2 concentrations in our study 2 4 cdi metrics and theoretical electrode potentials to determine salt adsorption two metrics were used 1 sac and 2 ion adsorption capacity iac sac is the ratio of total salt adsorbed to the total mass of electrodes and iac is the ratio of the adsorption of an individual ion i e na or cl to the total mass of electrodes eq 1 1 sac or iac q

conductivity or ic values while the iac is based on individual ion concentrations and could only be obtained from ic data in cases when we observed large ph fluctuations in the effluent we excluded subtracted the contributions of h or oh to the measured conductivity in order to obtain a corrected conductivity reflecting only na and cl eq 2 holubowitch et al 2017 lee et al 2018 2 Ð± nacl Ð± meas

we calculated the theoretical potentials for several possible reactions under actual conditions of ph h2o2 and do measured in our cells eq 6 and compared them to the measured electrode potentials

low 10 mm we assumed activity coefficients of one for all species 3 results and discussion 3 1 na and cl removals in the presence of oxygen we first examined na and cl removals during the charging cycle upon applying a voltage na and cl concentrations in the effluent of the uc orientation dropped sharply and then slowly increased toward the influent concentration fig 1 a the difference between the na and cl concentrations at each time point was within the error of the ic method indicating that na and cl removals were approaching a 1 1 symmetry to confirm this observation we summed the total mass of na and cl removed comparable amounts of na and cl were removed 107 8 3 6 Î¼mol na g c and 126 5 4 9 Î¼mol cl g c after the 30 min charging phase was complete fig 1c although less na was removed than cl the difference was not significant p 0 06 thus the removal of ions in the uc orientation approached a 1 1 symmetry in the ua orientation cl but not na removal followed a similar trend as in the uc orientation at all time points na concentrations were greater than cl fig 1b this difference persisted throughout the entire charging phase at several time points na concentrations exceeded the influent value including near the beginning 2 min and from about 22 min until the end of the cycle the release of na at the beginning of charging which is consistent with prior reports of inversion peaks might be attributed to co ion expulsion ahualli et al 2017 bouhadana et al 2011a cohen et al 2015 omosebi et al 2014 this peak was unique to na in the ua orientation suggesting that the orientation of that cell led to changes on the electrode that did not occur in the uc orientation potential causes of this inversion peak are discussed below in the sections on faradaic reactions by the end of the charging phase 59 5 14 5 Î¼mol na g c and 143 5 7 9 Î¼mol cl g c were removed which based on statistical analysis were found to be significantly different p 0 05 while na removals were strongly dependent on electrode orientation p 0 05 cl removals were not indicating that the difference in na removals was independent of cl removal we measured na and cl recoveries during the discharge phase in each orientation although the removal of ions was approaching 1 1 symmetry in the uc configuration during charging the recovery of cl during discharging was lower than na 109 9 4 1 Î¼mol na g c and 85 3 14 2 Î¼mol cl g c fig s4a in the ua configuration the desorption results were consistent with the lower na removal observed during charging 74 9 15 7 Î¼mol na g c and 122 6 2 1 Î¼mol cl g c fig s4b collectively these charging and discharging results show that less na was removed in the ua orientation the charge efficiency and energy consumption were also dependent on electrode orientation the uc orientation which had a larger salt removal had a 38 1 1 4 larger charge efficiency 51 1 1 6 and 26 7 2 6 decrease in energy consumption 46 1 kt ion relative to the ua orientation the larger charge efficiency of the uc orientation supports our findings above that faradaic reactions occurred to a lesser extent than in the ua configuration 3 2 dissolved oxygen profiles since our ic results indicated that na removals were affected by electrode orientation we explored possible o2 driven cathodic reactions that may have competed with and decreased na adsorption we first measured effluent do concentrations during the charging and discharging cycles the effluent do concentrations in both orientations decreased during charging but the kinetics and extent of do consumption were orientation dependent fig 2 a in the uc orientation the do concentrations decreased slowly from 8 12 0 34 to around 3 73 0 25 mg l 1 and did not plateau the do concentrations in the ua orientation dropped much faster and nearly leveled reaching 1 28 0 04 mg l 1 within 14 min of the charging phase during discharging the do concentrations in the ua orientation converged back to the do of the influent 8 45 0 2 mg l 1 in the uc orientation the effluent do concentration did not reach the influent concentration within the 30 min discharge phase there are two possible mechanisms that can explain the do trend in the uc orientation during the discharging phase first less do was consumed in that orientation during charging a smaller do gradient would translate into a slower rate of o2 transfer because the deficit difference between do at saturation and actual do is smaller second the anode which was located downstream from the cathode may have provided an additional barrier to do transport prior to exiting the cell to test this hypothesis we operated the uc cell at a higher flow rate 7 ml min 1 instead of 3 ml min 1 not only did the effluent do levels approach saturation within 10 min of discharging fig s5 they also stabilized more quickly during the charging phase those results suggest that the dynamics of do consumption and regeneration were different in the two configurations 3 3 oxygen reduction reactions the decrease of do in both orientations may have been due to several cathode driven o2 reduction reactions orrs holubowitch et al 2019 shapira et al 2016 in a two electron transfer process o2 can be reduced to form h2o2 eq 7 and in a four electron pathway it can generate oh and or h2o eqs 8 and 9 7 o â 2 h 2

theoretical potentials i e standard reduction potentials adjusted for actual conditions via eq 6 for an oxidation reduction reaction to be thermodynamically favorable the measured potential needs to be more less positive than the theoretical value based on the measured cathode potentials and theoretical predictions for the ua orientation we assumed that the effluent ph measured in the uc orientation was identical to the ph coming in contact with the cathode in the ua orientation we determined that eqs 7 9 were thermodynamically favorable in our cells fig s6 3 3 1 oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide to validate the occurrence of eq 7 we measured effluent h2o2 concentrations over time during the charging and discharging phases at the end of the charging phase 68 8 0 2 and 12 3 0 6 Î¼m h2o2 were measured in the ua and the uc orientations respectively which translates into a factor of 5 5 increase in h2o2 generation in the ua orientation fig 2b during discharging h2o2 concentrations in both orientations decreased toward zero demonstrating that an applied voltage was required to drive h2o2 generation there are two possible explanations for the differences in h2o2 generation between the two orientations first conditions in the ua orientation may have been more favorable for h2o2 production according to eq 7 h2o2 generation is dependent on the concentration of do and h assuming that do concentrations reaching the cathode in both orientations were the same as measured in the influent i e no do loss at the anode in the ua orientation h would limit h2o2 production in this situation increasing h should increase h2o2 production oxidation of carbon at the anode is one faradaic reaction that could increase h according to eq 10 10 1 4 c 1 2 h â o 1 4 co â h e e 0 7 0 9 v she based on comparison of the anode potentials measured during the charging phase fig s7 and the theoretical potential for carbon oxidation this reaction was favorable during the entire 30 min for both orientations to determine if anode oxidation in the ua orientation generated h that enhanced h2o2 generation at the downstream cathode we measured the effluent ph in both orientations fig 3 during charging the influent ph remained constant at 6 0 0 1 we observed substantial differences in effluent ph between the two orientations in the uc orientation the effluent ph became acidic decreasing to 4 3 0 1 after 10 min of charging and then remained approximately constant at 3 7 0 2 for the rest of the charging phase the sharp drop in ph strongly suggests that carbon in the downstream anode was undergoing oxidation assuming the same ph drop occurred across the anode in the ua orientation the solution coming in contact with the downstream cathode would have an approximately 50 fold greater h concentration relative to the influent after 10 min of charging and 200 fold greater in the last 20 min of the cycle in the uc orientation the anode was located downstream h generated at the anode would transport away from the cathode due to the direction of flow and not enhance h2o2 generation to validate that the cathode was h limited in the uc orientation we conducted an additional test in which we decreased the influent ph from 6 0 0 1 to 5 1 0 2 using 1 m hcl the effluent h2o2 concentration in that test doubled compared to the test where the ph was neutral confirming h was a primary driver of h2o2 in the ft cdi cell fig s8 a second explanation for the lower h2o2 concentrations in the uc orientation is that h2o2 was oxidized when it came in contact with the downstream anode prior studies have suggested but not proven that h2o2 oxidation to o2 at the anode reverse of eq 7 may occur in cdi holubowitch et al 2019 based on our measured anode potentials in the uc orientation h2o2 oxidation was thermodynamically favorable fig s9 to determine if h2o2 oxidation was occurring we conducted an additional test in which 65 Î¼m h2o2 was amended to a n2 gas purged influent removing o2 allowed us to better quantify h2o2 oxidation and o2 generation during the charging cycle the influent h2o2 concentration remained constant at 65 3 0 9 Î¼m the effluent h2o2 concentration dropped sharply in the first 2 min to 26 6 1 6 Î¼m and then leveled at 17 7 0 4 Î¼m fig 4 the consumption of h2o2 was accompanied by production of o2 effluent do concentrations increased rapidly from an initial value of 0 22 0 08 mg l 1 to 1 27 0 04 mg l 1 within 2 min of charging fig 4 these measurements provide strong evidence that the lower effluent h2o2 concentrations and higher do concentrations recorded in the uc orientation under aerobic conditions may have been attributed to h2o2 oxidation at the downstream anode h2o2 oxidation was unlikely in the ua orientation because h2o2 generated at the downstream cathode in that orientation would be transported away from the anode 3 3 2 four electron oxygen reduction pathways to determine the contribution of the four electron pathway orrs eqs 8 and 9 to the observed differences in na removal we first conducted a do balance in each orientation we confirmed that prior to applying a voltage the effluent and influent do concentrations were in agreement fig 5 t 0 min once we applied a voltage we accounted for the do consumed to generate h2o2 in both orientations by converting our measured effluent h2o2 concentrations fig 2b into an equivalent amount of do based on eq 7 do h2o2 we combined that amount of do with the do measured in the effluent do effluent if all of the do consumed during charging fig 2a was associated with h2o2 generation the combined value would equal the influent do value in both orientations the combined and influent values did not agree indicating that other reactions consumed do in the cells do other fig 5 the magnitude of the disagreement was dependent on orientation in the ua orientation there was a larger amount of do that couldn t be accounted for than in the uc orientation one explanation for the unaccounted do in the ua orientation is that the four electron orrs were occurring to a greater extent in that orientation support for this hypothesis is the appreciable increase in effluent ph of the ua orientation during charging fig 3 the effluent ph initially dropped from 6 0 to 5 0 0 1 but then increased sharply to peak at 9 7 0 2 and remained around 9 5 0 1 for the remainder of the charging phase this ph change is consistent with oh generation eq 8 or h consumption eq 9 alternatively the basic ph could be attributed to generation of h2o2 which consumes h via eq 7 at the downstream cathode when we predicted the increase in effluent ph associated with only h2o2 generation predicted ph h2o2 in fig s10 calculated assuming the effluent ph in the uc orientation ph 3 7 was the same as the ph coming into contact with the downstream cathode in the ua orientation the ph did not agree with the measured ph in the effluent however when we assumed that the unaccounted do do other in fig 5 was reduced to oh and or h2o the predicted ph predicted ph orr in fig s10 became basic this trend was consistent with the measured ph values the predicted ph values were larger than the measured values possibly due to our assumption that the ph coming into contact with the cathode was around 3 7 the actual ph may have been lower than this assumption for example holubowitch et al 2017 reported a ph of 2 5 near the anode due to carbon oxidation when we assumed a ph of 2 5 the predicted ph orr and measured values were in much better agreement in short these results indicate that both the two and four electron orr pathways occurred to a greater extent in the ua orientation relative to the uc configuration 3 4 cdi operation in the absence of oxygen 3 4 1 na and cl removals our results above strongly suggest that orrs at the cathode were contributing to the decreased removal of na in the ua orientation in the absence of o2 this effect should disappear and equal amounts of na and cl removed to test this hypothesis we conducted additional experiments while continuously purging the influent with n2 gas during the tests the do concentrations remained below 0 18 0 06 mg l 1 in the influent in the uc orientation the amount of na and cl removed was similar by the end of the charging cycle 134 6 26 9 Î¼mol na g c and 125 1 25 1 Î¼mol cl g c were removed fig 6 a these removals were not significantly different than those recorded when o2 was present p 0 05 in the ua orientation na removal increased sharply in the absence of o2 reaching 143 3 15 7 Î¼mol na g c fig 6a this was a significant increase compared to the 59 5 14 5 Î¼mol na g c removed in the presence of o2 p 0 05 the cl removals were very comparable in the presence versus absence of o2 in the absence of o2 cl removal reached 152 6 24 1 Î¼mol cl g c which was slightly larger than when o2 was present 143 5 7 9 Î¼mol cl g c but not significantly different p 0 05 the symmetry of na and cl removal in the ua orientation therefore improved when o2 was removed from the system our results also suggest that when o2 is not present the effect of electrode orientation in ft cdi becomes minimal because orrs are eliminated this can be seen from the accumulated charge curves in our cells fig s11 the ua orientation resulted in a sharper increase in the accumulated charges when tested with o2 because of a greater consumption in charge towards faradaic reactions orrs and or carbon oxidation compared to the uc orientation both orientations showed a similar cumulative charge behavior during the charging and discharging cycles in the absence of o2 as a result both orientations under anaerobic conditions yielded a near symmetrical removal of na and cl 3 4 2 effluent ph profiles we also monitored the effluent ph in the absence of o2 to determine if similar ph profiles as we observed with o2 would occur with o2 absent electrode oxidation would be the primary faradaic reaction occurring in our system eq 10 since carbon oxidation is an anode driven process we expected that the effluent ph profile would follow the same trend under anaerobic and aerobic conditions when the anode was positioned downstream when we purged the influent with n2 gas the effluent ph in the uc orientation dropped during charging to 4 5 0 5 and then increased during discharging to the influent ph value fig 6b supporting the occurrence of anode oxidation this trend was consistent with the ph profile when o2 was present except that the effluent ph was lower in the presence of o2 two possible reasons for the lower ph under aerobic conditions are 1 h were generated during the oxidation of h2o2 at the downstream anode and 2 the presence of o2 shifted the distribution of the applied voltage towards anode potentials that enabled greater carbon oxidation cohen et al 2015 omosebi et al 2014 in the ua orientation the effluent ph profile was much different when o2 was absent rather than increasing the ph slowly decreased over the charging cycle reaching a final value of 5 5 0 1 fig 6b the change in effluent ph profile was due to the lack of o2 driven consumption generation of h oh instead the slow decrease in ph was likely a result of h generated from oxidation of the upstream anode the ph did not drop as quickly as in the uc orientation because some h produced at the anode were likely adsorbed at the downstream cathode the drop in effluent ph to 4 7 0 2 in the first 5 min of discharging supports our hypothesis that h were adsorbed onto the cathode during the charging phase and is consistent with the ph measured during discharging under aerobic conditions fig 3 since na removals were nearly identical in the uc and ua orientations in the absence of o2 h adsorption does not appear to be a strong competitor with na for adsorption sites during charging we did not expect a competitive effect because h concentrations were several orders of magnitude lower than na in both orientations 50 times lower at ph 3 7 in the ua cell and 10 000 times lower at ph 6 0 in the uc variation in effluent ph in ft cdi has previously been attributed to differences in diffusion coefficients of h and oh and or water dissociation dykstra et al 2017 tang et al 2017 h has a higher mobility than oh 9 13 10 9 and 5 16 10 9 m2 s 1 respectively atkins and de paula 2006 h may therefore more readily transport into electrode micropores of opposite charge than oh resulting in an excess of oh in solution he et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 regarding water dissociation zhang et al 2019 hypothesized that when cl adsorbed in the upstream electrode in the ua orientation h generated from water dissociation near the downstream electrode was adsorbed at the cathode resulting in a basic ph in the effluent our results suggest that these two non faradaic processes were not the main driver of ph changes in our ft cdi cells if these processes were predominant their effect should be independent of o2 in the absence of o2 we observed a dramatic shift in effluent ph from basic to acidic in the ua orientation during charging if differences in diffusion of h and oh and or water dissociation resulting in adsorption of h at the downstream cathode and release of oh into the effluent were predominate then we would expect similar ph profiles and na removals in the presence and absence of o2 our results showing a decrease in effluent ph in the absence of o2 indicate that faradaic reactions involving h oh consumption generation were the primary drivers of ph changes the ph dependence in o2 environment was also reported by bouhadana et al 2011b a much smaller ph variation was observed in their ft cdi system when o2 was removed further confirming the dependence of ph changes on o2 driven reactions and supporting our results nevertheless further elucidating the contribution of these non faradaic processes on ph fluctuations is warranted 3 5 salt adsorption capacity determining accurate values of sac is important for benchmarking cdi technologies we determined if asymmetrical salt removals impacted calculations of sac in our ft cdi cells the traditional approach to calculate sac is to estimate total salt removal based on changes in solution conductivity fig s12 but in the case of monovalent ions this approach is based on the assumption of a 1 1 symmetrical removal of anions and cations suss et al 2015 when we used that approach without correcting for ph we obtained a sac of 6 53 0 16 and 4 63 0 19 mg g c 1 in the uc and ua orientations respectively when we considered the actual ion concentrations based on our ic data of samples taken at the same time as the conductivity readings we calculated the sac as 6 97 0 17 and 6 46 0 61 mg g c 1 in the uc and ua orientations respectively while the conductivity and ic based sac values for the uc orientation were similar the sac was 39 3 11 5 larger when the actual ion composition was determined for the ua configuration this result is in contrast with the near identical sac values based on actual ion concentrations and conductivity changes reported by srimuk et al 2018 however in that study they removed do our system where do was present suggests that orrs and carbon oxidation were primary reasons for the discrepancy between sac values adjusting conductivity readings to account for changes in ph is a common practice when calculating sac holubowitch et al 2017 lado et al 2014 lee et al 2018 li and park 2018 tang et al 2017 when we used this approach we observed a difference between conductivity and ic based predictions of sac the sac for the ua orientation when recalculated based on a ph corrected solution conductivity eqs 2 and 3 increased from 4 63 0 19 to 5 28 0 20 mg g c 1 when this correction was applied to the uc orientation the contribution of water conductivity was more significant due to the larger number of h generated in the effluent this resulted in a corrected value of 10 65 0 19 mg g c 1 which was almost double the actual removal 6 97 0 17 mg g c 1 this result highlights that ph corrected conductivities might not reflect the true sac of a system especially when do is present further research is needed to better understand the relationships between ph fluctuations conductivity and actual salt removals so that the accuracy of sac values can be ensured 3 6 mechanisms driving asymmetrical salt removal in flow through cdi towards understanding a mechanistic explanation for asymmetrical salt removal in ft cdi we developed two conceptual models based on our experimental results one for each electrode orientation overall the primary difference between the orientations is the extent to which orrs occur in the system this in turn influences na removal at the cathode in the uc orientation fig 7 a there was less competition between na and the orrs for electrons generated at the anode since the ph of the influent as it flowed into the cathode was near neutral h2o2 generation which was h dependent was limited our tests in which h2o2 concentrations increased when we lowered the influent ph confirmed that h was limiting the reaction h generated at the anode due to carbon oxidation that could have enhanced h2o2 generation were transported away from the cathode due to the direction of flow through the cell removing o2 in the uc orientation did not significantly change na removals compared to when o2 was present p 0 23 further confirming minimal competition for electrons between na and the orrs in the ua orientation na removals decreased because orrs at the cathode were enhanced fig 7b the production of h2o2 became more favorable in this orientation because the concentration of h flowing into the cathode was larger the h originating from oxidation of the upstream anode were consumed during orrs and or adsorbed to the cathode support for the latter was provided by the sharp drop in ph during discharging in the ua orientation competition of h with na was unlikely a major driver of the na removal differences because h was always present at concentrations much lower than na in both orientations the adsorption of cl was not limited by na adsorption in the two orientations when na removals increased either by purging with n2 gas or positioning the cathode as the upstream electrode the removal of cl did not change significantly the primary faradaic reaction occurring at the anode was likely carbon oxidation it may be possible that carbon oxidation did not exert a competitive effect with cl because of the relatively short duration of our tests gao et al 2016 suggested that cl removal would not vary for short term tests because the competitive effect of carbon oxidation would not become pronounced until long term operation alternative explanations for asymmetrical salt removal in cdi have included differences in ion mobility and or surface complexation bouhadana et al 2011b tang et al 2017 kalluri et al 2013 reported that the hydrated radius of an ion can impact adsorption using activated carbon electrodes with micropores of various widths 0 65 1 6 nm which were comparable in size to hydrated cl and na they observed less cl adsorption than na they attributed differences in removal to the larger hydrated radius of cl ca 0 36 nm for cl and 0 33 nm for na differences in hydrated radii likely did not play a major role in our observed asymmetrical ion removals because 1 a previous study using the same electrode material as this study confirmed that the pores were large enough to not have an effect on the adsorption symmetry of na and cl avraham et al 2008 and 2 asymmetry driven by differences in hydrated radii should be independent of electrode orientation and presence absence of o2 since we observed improved symmetry of na and cl removal in either the uc orientation or the absence of o2 in the ua orientation our results do not support the hypothesis that differences in hydrated radii were the main drivers of asymmetry one way that o2 based faradaic reactions could have caused lower na removals in the ua orientation is that the point of zero charge of the anode e pzc shifted to more positive values e pzc is a fundamental material property of the electrical double layer interface for capacitive charge ion storage bouhadana et al 2011a cohen et al 2013 gao et al 2015 two identical electrodes will initially have the same e pzc under an applied voltage the cathode and anode e pzc may shift depending on the length of operation do concentration and extent of faradaic reactions omosebi et al 2014 shapira et al 2016 omosebi et al 2014 showed that after 50 cycles 1 h each of operation in the presence of do the anode e pzc shifted form ca 0 1to 0 4 v while the cathode e pzc remained nearly identical with or without do the authors attributed the positive shift in anode e pzc to the redox couple between cathodic orrs and anodic carbon oxidation that formed oxidative groups on the anode surface they reported that the positive e pzc shift resulted in an inversion peak during charging caused by co ion expulsion from the anode based on this understanding of e pzc we expect that the larger do concentrations coming into contact with the anode coupled with greater orrs at the cathode in the ua orientation likely caused a shift to more positive e pzc potentials at the anode in the uc orientation the anode e pzc was likely more stable because the do concentrations at the downstream anode were lower due to do consumption at the upstream cathode and faradaic reactions were less favorable our observation of a na but not cl inversion peak at the start of the charging cycle fig 1b in the ua orientation is consistent with increased expulsion of co ions due to a more positive e pzc at the anode we did not observe this inversion behavior in the uc orientation which suggests that the anode e pzc was more stable to summarize we hypothesize that the greater degree of faradaic reactions in the ua orientation may have increased the anode e pzc to more positive values which in turn contributed to asymmetrical ion removals in that orientation further support for this hypothesis is the improved symmetry of na and cl removal in the absence of o2 in the ua orientation one interesting hypothesis that our findings raise is the role of h2o2 oxidation on the removal of na at the cathode it is plausible that electrons obtained from h2o2 oxidation at a downstream anode contributed to upstream na adsorption analogous to asymmetrical cdi systems using one capacitive and one faradaic electrode lee et al 2014 internal recycling of electrons in this manner may be part of the reason why na removals improved in the uc orientation but further research on this pathway is needed to validate its contribution 4 conclusions in this study we measured the removals of na and cl as a function of electrode orientation in flow through capacitive deionization ft cdi we quantified ion removals using ion chromatography ic and determined the occurrence of oxygen reduction reactions orrs based on measurements of ph dissolved oxygen do and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the following points summarize our major findings when the cathode was placed upstream upstream cathode uc the removals of na and cl approached a 1 1 symmetry placing the anode upstream upstream anode ua however resulted in almost 2 5 times less na removed than cl between the uc and ua orientations cl removal remained nearly identical indicating that na was the main contributor to the asymmetry enhanced orrs were responsible for the decreased na removal in the ua orientation in the uc orientation do conversion to h2o2 at the cathode was h limited in the ua orientation h from the oxidation of carbon in the anode increased the orrs at the downstream cathode most notably the generation of h2o2 in the absence of o2 na and cl removals were nearly identical in the ua configuration confirming that orrs at the cathode were responsible for the decrease in na removal when o2 was present effluent ph profiles between the two orientations were dramatically different when o2 was present the uc orientation yielded an acidic ph 3 7 0 2 and the ua orientation produced a basic ph 9 7 0 2 during the charging phase in the absence of o2 both orientations yielded acidic effluents suggesting that the basic ph measured in the ua configuration under the aerobic experimental conditions was not due to oh generation from water dissociation salt adsorption capacities sacs calculated using actual na and cl concentrations based on ic measurements were 6 8 2 9 and 39 3 11 5 larger in the uc and ua orientations respectively compared to sacs calculated using changes in solution conductivity obtaining actual na and cl concentrations rather than using conductivity measurements is needed to improve the accuracy of sacs

17747,the development of novel wastewater platforms should include the analysis of the most critical functional factors including the effects of toxic or inhibitory substances due to the novelty of purple phototrophic bacteria ppb based wastewater treatment systems this analysis has not been done yet in mixed cultures in this work various relevant chemical compounds including aromatic phenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol or 246tcp 4 nitrophenol or 4cp sulfathiazole and aliphatic organics methanol trichlorethylene or tce oleic acid ethanol propionic acid inorganic salts ammonium clo3 na and metals fe3 fe2 cu2 zn2 ni2 al3 as well as ph are analyzed for their effect on mixed ppb cultures in anaerobic photoheterotrophic conditions using acetate as the model organic substrate the most toxic substances detected were 246tcp 4np cu2 fe2 and ni2 k i for activity 23 2 97 12 3 1 0 4 13 3 13 1 mg l and k i or toxicity threshold for growth 17 2 119 3 5 0 4 4 8 22 9 mg l respectively some substances inhibited the activity more than the growth sulfathiazole ni2 and fe3 or the growth more than the activity tce 4np and fe2 in addition some organic substrates such as phenol ethanol and propionate specifically inhibited the acetate uptake being noncompetitive in the case of phenol and ethanol and most likely competitive in the case of propionate these findings are relevant for the wastewater treatment and resource recovery applications of the ppb technology as well as for the upgrading of current models photo anaerobic model in addition the data will open possibilities to promote the production of specific compounds as pha or single cell proteins by selectively inhibiting some parts of the ppb metabolism graphical abstract image 1 keywords purple phototrophic bacteria inhibition toxicity resource recovery 1 introduction the development of novel wastewater treatment technologies and the industrial scale up can be affected by several factors these include limited scalability high costs capital and operational as well as operational drawbacks such as inconsistent removal performances due to varying types of wastewaters and compositions da silva and reis 2015 all of these have affected and sometimes delayed the application of several treatment technologies examples include anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and microalgae based processes for the first anammox full scale it took nearly a decade to achieve stable performance at design removal loads van der star et al 2007 while microalgae based process after 50 years of research are still affected by sudden predation flynn et al 2017 and general culture instabilities da silva and reis 2015 pragya et al 2013 even long established conventional processes activated sludge and biological nutrient removal are still affected by episodes of sludge bulking and foaming pal et al 2014 martins et al 2004 while anaerobic system can be affected by sludge washout due to various reasons daud et al 2018 and are generally affected by high ammonia loads that considerably limits their applicability jiang et al 2019 in this context emerging purple phototrophic bacteria ppb based wastewater treatment is likely to experience various operational problems towards final scale up and application while some might be related to the reactor design which to date is still being assessed puyol et al 2020 others might very well be related to the chemical composition of the wastewater from other emerging biological processes some of the potential inhibitory components include nitrophenols trichlorethylene tce sulfathiazole chlorate or long chain fatty acids lcfa nitrophenols decouple metabolism in microalgae fuerst and norman 1991 while sulfathiazole inhibits the oxygenic photosynthesis biaÅk bieliÅska et al 2011 tce specifically inhibits nitrifying bacteria especially ammonium oxidation fuller and scow 1997 while chlorate inhibits nitrate reduction rusmana and nedwell 2004 in addition lcfa cause failure of anaerobic digestion by specifically binding in membranes of methanogens dasa et al 2016 therefore all of these components affect specific biological processes found in wastewater treatment technologies however none of these has been assessed for ppb specifically while some are likely to affect ppb due to the general mode of action others are not or the effects cannot be extrapolated due to fundamental metabolic differences in addition these compounds are typical in wastewater sources potentially treatable by ppb and concentrations are highly variable depending on the wastewater type as listed in table 1 other potentially inhibitory compounds belongs to the family of substituted and non substituted aromatics organic substrates as alcohols volatile and non volatile organic acids as well as inorganic compounds like ammonium sodium and transition metals which are also included in table 1 nevertheless the toxicities of some metals and pesticides over pure ppb cultures have been assessed to an extent previous works have demonstrated toxic effects of cu and cd on the photosynthetic apparatus zhuo et al 2017 jaime pÃ©rez et al 2019 however toxicities seem to be species dependent and while some species are resistant and have been proposed to be a heavy metal removal mediators rhodobacter sphaeroides others are completely inhibited at ni co cr and mo concentrations of 47 22 2015 and 18 mg l respectively buccolieri et al 2006 similar findings were reported for pesticides while several families of herbicides like triazines nitrophenols nitriles and pyridazinones were reported to inhibit the photosystem ii electron transport chain in ppb genera like rhodopseudomonas and rhodobacter fuerst and norman 1991 other authors published toxicological data indicating that ppb can tolerate up to 2 6 mg l of pesticides such as triclosan compared to ec50 values between 0 01 and 0 1 mg l for other photosynthetic microorganisms e g microalgae johansson et al 2014 there are a few studies analyzing the inhibitory effect of organic substrates as propionate and substituted phenols on the growth of ppb species witte et al 1998 maruyama and kitamura 1985 escher et al 1996 however there is a patent lack of studies on the inhibitory effect of phenol over ppb species and it has been shown as a good substrate for hydrogen production in e g rhodopseudomonas palustris shi et al 2015 in any case almost all of these works deal with pure cultures of ppb and the information regarding the inhibitory effect of organic or inorganic compounds over ppb mixed cultures is limited to a few works wu et al 2012 laurinavichene et al 2013 mixed cultures are known to exert increased resistance over stress situations caused by chemical or physical disturbances allison and martiny 2008 this is strongly motivated by the improved resilience and the inherent capability of bacteria to interact each other garcia 2016 in a previous work a mixed ppb culture showed a strong resilience against a toxic stress caused by a sudden increase of the organic loading rate of a synthetic wastewater containing a mixture of inhibitory organic compounds de las heras et al 2020 this resilience enlarges the resistance of mixed cultures to chemical toxicity compared with pure cultures bachenheimer and bennett 1961 in this context details about the quantitative and qualitative inhibitory effects of common wastewater components such as volatile fatty acids alcohols substituted phenols metals inorganic salts or long chain fatty acids on ppb mixed cultures remain unknown however the knowledge about the effects of these components on mixed ppb cultures is essential and it will enable the optimization of wastewater treatment and resource recovery with ppb eventually facilitating the scale up this work aims to analyze the inhibitory effect of a wide list of typical wastewater components on mixed ppb cultures the effects are measured and quantified by using a statistical approach and when possible inhibitory parameters are calculated the inhibitory limiting mechanisms are then discussed in order to propose solutions to enhance the capabilities of ppb for wastewater treatment with a specific focus on resource recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 origin of the cultures mixed ppb cultures were enriched from domestic wastewater obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant in mostoles spain spanish mixed culture smc or from brisbane australia australian mixed culture amc for the smc the wastewater was supplemented with 2 gcod l of a mixture of acetate propionate butyrate ethanol and yeast extract in a cod ratio of 1 1 1 1 0 1 ammonium chloride and sodium dihydrogen phosphate were added to reach a cod n p ratio of 100 7 5 1 5 the culture was cultivated in 10 l iso bottles during 7 days in anaerobic conditions ph 7 5 and a temperature of 33 6 0 8 c illuminated with 150 w infrared lamps and covered with vis uv filters providing 100 w m2 of nir irradiance following enrichment for analytical and inoculum purposes the culture was continuously stirred at 500 rpm in a 10 l schott bottle and fed weekly with 90 fresh wastewater under the above described conditions for the amc acetic acid 500 mgcod l was added as carbon source following enrichment the culture was continuously stirred at 500 rpm in a 10 l schott bottle and fed weekly with 90 fresh wastewater under the above described conditions in order to check for the consistent enrichment of the inoculum biomass samples from the inoculum were analyzed for the vis nir spectrum over a 400 900 nm range 2 2 inhibitory batch tests inhibition batch tests were conducted in 160 ml serum bottles the growth medium was prepared from stock solutions of macronutrients trace elements and organic source at ph 7 according to a previous work puyol et al 2017a acetate at 500 mgcod l was the sole organic carbon source and was added from a stock solution of acetate of 20 gcod l at ph 7 experimental basis for this relies on the assumption that there are no other potential microbial processes capable of uptaking acetate in anaerobic conditions without the presence of other electron acceptors like nitrite nitrate sulfate or oxidized metals in fact the only preeminent process that can sustain grow on acetate in these experimental conditions is acetoclastic methanogenesis which is a much slower process and the competition with ppb for the acetate would be almost non existent as has been previously pointed out puyol et al 2017 the medium was inoculated with 200 mgvss l of ppb mixed cultures and was subsequently supplemented with the toxicants of study in a different concentrations range as specified in table 2 initial ph was then fixed at 7 0 except for the assays where the initial ph effect was explored ph values set at 5 6 7 2 8 5 and 10 where the toxicant is included in the medium composition concentrations range in table 2 represents the extra addition of the toxicant an additional experiment with no toxicant was also prepared as a control thus every inhibitory assay had its own control test preparation of batch experiments was performed according to puyol et al 2017a the experiments were carried out in a 120 rpm temperature controlled shaker at 30 c illuminated with 150 w infrared lamps and covered with vis uv filters providing an average of 100 w m2 of nir irradiance liquid raw samples 3 5 ml were extracted several times during each assay to measure total cod part of the raw samples was filtered through 0 7 Î¼m glass fiber syringe filters when the toxicants were aromatic compounds or 0 44 Î¼m cellulose syringe filters in the rest of the cases to measure soluble cod consumption and to analyze the evolution of volatile fatty acids vfa ammonium and the inhibitory organics initial and final samples were also extracted to measure ph and total and volatile suspended solids tss vss 2 3 analytical methods total and soluble cod and tss vss were measured following standard procedures apha 2005 nh4 was measured by merck kits merck darmstadt germany data of ammonium concentration was independent from the ph and thereby ammonium is referred in this work to total ammonia nitrogen tan irradiance was measured with a spectroradiometer stn bluewave vis nir stellarnet tampa usa the vis nir 400 950 nm absorbance spectra was performed by vis nir spectrometry v 630 jasco madrid spain aromatic organics were measured by hplc dad according to melero et al 2007 by using a varian prostar 350 apparatus agilent technologies santa clara usa vfas and alcohols were measured by hplc ir following vasiliadou et al 2018 by using a varian 356 lc agilent technologies santa clara usa 2 4 data handling and statistical analysis dissociation of acid base pairs was simulated by using the software visual minteq 3 1 in order to simulate the effect of the presence of microorganisms over the inorganic s speciation and the chemical equilibrium at the beginning of the toxicity tests a 1 1 mixture of solid humic and fulvic acids at 200 mg l was added into the speciation model following the stockholm humic model solid humic and fulvic substances are complex organic nitrogen containing compounds with functional properties similar to microbial biomass marsac et al 2017 subsequently the model was run and the soluble precipitated and adsorbed species were recorded the sum of all the soluble species were considered as bioavailable for the microorganisms and thereby were used as the initial concentration values of the inorganic toxicants for the estimation of the inhibitory parameters this theoretical calculation has been checked with real soluble data of some metals at the beginning of the experiments which validated the assumptions made in the simulation see supplementary information for more details activity and growth are expressed as specific phototrophic activity spa in gcod gvss d and apparent biomass yield y x s in gvss gcod and were calculated dynamically by using the data from triplicate experiments for each concentration of the toxicant compound and the controls concerning the time course of scod and the initial and final vss values this data was fitted to a simple monod model where the saturation constant k s mgcod l was fixed at 20 mgcod l according to a previous work puyol et al 2017a the model leads to the calculation of the specific substrate consumption rate k m gcod gvss d which corresponds to the spa values and the y x s the model was implemented in aquasim 2 1d more details are provided in supplementary information normalized phototrophic activities npa and normalized biomass yield nby values were calculated based on the spa and y x s from the controls as follows 1 n p a s p a i s p a c 2 n b y y x s i y x s c where the indexes i and c represent the values for the i concentration of the toxicant and the values for the controls respectively normalized values were useful for the comparison between the different toxicity experiments as the values of the control experiments had some variability the correlation between the npa nby and the concentration of the toxicants was estimated by linear regression where positive or negative effects were associated to the slope of the linear regression at 95 confidence p value 0 05 additionally in those assays where the inhibitor was a biodegradable organic compound phenol propionate methanol ethanol and oleic acid which may potentially compete with acetate as substrate the normalized specific acetate uptake rate has been estimated dynamically following the same methodology described for the npa and nby in this case the specific acetate uptake rate has units of mgcod acetate mgvss d whereas the y x acetate units are mgvss mgcod acetate normalization was also carried out as described previously values of npa and nby of all the individual experiments were analyzed for the significance of the effects of the toxicant we used this method instead of the analysis of the significance for the averages from triplicates as some individual experiments were lost during the experimental stage linear correlations were performed over the whole data set and analysis of variance fisher matrix was used to check for the significance of the slope of the linear regression at 0 05 level a direct plot of npa against nby provides evidences on the inhibition nature of the tested compounds as it predicts whether the inhibitory effects over activity or growth are coupled or uncoupled as will be further analyzed in the section 4 2 2 5 modeling inhibitory processes where the correlation between npa nby and the concentration of the toxicant was significantly negative which evidences a negative effect data was fitted to a novel inhibition equation described in the eq 3 which is derived from the hill functions 3 n p a 1 1 i k i 2 k i k i i mode in the eq 3 the k i represents the non competitive inhibitory constant mg toxicant l and the new parameter i mode represents the inhibition type with values ranging between k i and k i when i mode k i the hill function becomes the typical non competitive function when k i i mode 0 there is no threshold in the inhibitory action for any increase of the inhibitor concentration the rate decreases significantly when i mode 0 the hill function becomes the typical 2 factor non competitive function when 0 i mode k i a threshold appears below that the inhibitor causes no significant effect on the rate cliff effect the i mode appears to be a minimum concentration of the inhibitor for the inhibition to be significant npa lower than 0 9 thereby i mode indicates the secure concentration of the inhibitor for avoiding inhibitory effects the derivation of the eq 3 is presented in the supplementary information this equation is proposed as a new inhibitory equation that can replace the non competitive equation and the hill functions in this new equation all the parameters have a physical meaning both k i and i mode represent inhibitor concentrations which differs from hill functions where exponentials are not associated to the physical nature of the experiment and therefore are empirical parameters in addition the non competitive equation is unable to predict a cliff effect the eq 3 have been updated in some cases to cover the situation where the toxicant does not stop completely the activity and the relationship between the npa values with the concentration of the compound follows asymptotically to a value higher than 0 this value corresponds to the minimum npa achieved irrespective of the toxicant concentration npa bas we modified the eq 3 in a way that inhibitory parameters are still possible to be calculated the eq 3 becomes in those cases eq 4 4 n p a 1 n p a b a s n p a c 1 1 i k i 2 k i k i i mode n p a b a s n p a c fitting experimental data to eqs 3 and 4 has been performed in originpro 2016 by using the levenberg marquardt algorithm damped least squares where the standard error in the parameter s estimation is calculated according to the error propagation formula confidence intervals were calculated by using the asymptotic symmetry method with a significance level Î± of 0 05 the data from the normalized specific acetate uptake rate obtained from the experiments where the toxicants are biodegradable organics were also compared with the competitive function which is described in eq 5 in this equation s ac and s i are the initial concentrations of acetate mgcod l and the organic inhibitor mgcod l respectively comparison between experimental data and simulation performed by using the eq 5 was performed by calculating the coefficient of correlation of spearman and significance of the difference was evaluated by confidence analysis with p value 0 05 5 n p a 1 s a c s i s a c 3 results 3 1 characterization of mixed cultures of ppb the smc and amc cultures were planktonic or micro granular bacterial aggregations with intense purple color the biomass vis nir absorbance spectra showed characteristic peaks at wavelengths around 400 550 nm carotenoids and three prominent peaks at 600 805 and 865 nm bacteriochlorophyll a the ratio between absorbance at 805 to absorbance at 660 nm abs805 abs660 was 1 19 0 07 which also gives a strong support about the uniformity of the inoculum and strong dominance of ppb as previously stated de las heras et al 2020 this indicates the successful enrichment of the ppb cultures puyol et al 2017a the spa values averaged 1 9 0 3 mgcod mgvss d with an average biomass yield of 0 62 0 08 mgvss mgcod similar to results described in the literature puyol et al 2017a hÃ¼lsen et al 2016 these cultures were used for all the inhibitory tests 3 2 effect of ph on the ppb metabolism the ph determines the speciation of the organic and inorganic salts the ionic potential through membranes and the reactivity of acidic and basic components kodukula et al 2018 it is necessary to control the ph to avoid hidden factors in inhibitory assays that can mask main findings as for example un dissociation of salts that can cause toxicity or precipitation of key nutrients that can hinder microbial growth carvajal arroyo et al 2013 zandvoort et al 2006 the effect of different ph was analyzed prior to all other tests to set the initial ph fig 1 shows the effect of ph on the nsa and the normalized biomass growth yield the ppb metabolism is quite stable at a ph range between 6 0 and 8 5 with negligible effects on both the nsa and the normalized biomass growth yield however extreme ph values 5 and 9 slightly affected the nsa and strongly reduce the nby chemical stressing conditions are suggested to be the main reason for low biomass yields the apparent biomass yield includes the use of substrate for maintenance energy production through catabolism via tri carboxylic acid tca cycle when the substrate is mainly use for maintenance low biomass yield is achieved this can be only possible by dissipating the excess of reductants in a dedicated pathway to allow for atp production it has been demonstrated that even in the presence of ammonium some ppb species as rba capsulatus are able to derepress the dinitrogenase protein accumulation which allows to remove the excess of reducing equivalents in the form of hydrogen gas tichi and tabita 2000 the fit of the experimental data to a gaussian model resulted in optimum ph values of 7 1 0 4 and 7 2 0 3 and amplitude values of 2 9 0 7 and 1 7 0 4 for the nsa and nby respectively this indicates that the ppb metabolism is not significantly affected at a ph range between 6 5 and 8 5 thereby all the experiments started with a ph of 7 0 which naturally increased to around 8 0 8 5 due to the consumption of the acetic acid and the additional organic substrates see more details in supporting information table s1 consequently the ph is discarded as an inhibitory factor in all cases 3 3 effect of aromatic organic compounds on the ppb metabolism aromatic organics are persistent pollutants that inhibit microorganisms typically present in wastewater treatment plants but they may also act as organic substrate cao et al 2009 fig 2 shows the effect of specific phenol derivatives on the metabolism of mixed ppb cultures at different initial concentrations regarding the effect on the activity 246tcp and 4np strongly inhibited the nsa the cultures were completely inhibited at concentrations above 50 and 200 mg l of 246tcp and 4np respectively however the inhibitory effect caused by 246tcp was incremental whereas 4np caused a sudden and very strong decrease of the activity at concentrations higher than 100 mg l cliff effect sulfathiazole caused a moderate inhibitory effect starting from the lowest concentration of 5 mg l in the case of phenol a strong inhibition at concentrations lower than 100 mg l was followed by a constant nsa at higher concentrations this indicates that the inhibitory mechanism of sulfathiazole and phenol is different from that caused by 246tcp and 4 cp fig 2 also shows the effect of these organics on the growth of the phototrophic cultures both sulfathiazole and phenol had minor impacts on the ppb growth at the tested concentrations ranges increasing concentrations of both compounds caused a significant increase of the biomass growth which may indicate usage as substrate this is further discussed below however both 246tcp and 4 cp resulted in complete growth inhibition at concentrations as low as 25 and 120 mg l respectively so these compounds are strong inhibitors of ppb biomass yield 3 4 effect of aliphatic organic compounds on the ppb metabolism the effects of some typical aliphatic organic compounds on the metabolism of mixed ppb cultures are shown in fig 3 in general aliphatic organics were mildly inhibitory for the specific activity with the exception of ethanol which was inhibitory of the nsa at values beyond 2000 mg l even propionic acid significantly improved the nsa over the concentration range tested and ethanol increased the nsa at concentrations below 2000 mg l this suggests that these act as co substrates as is further discussed below the effects of aliphatic organics on the growth yield differed especially in the case of tce and propionic acid increasing concentrations of tce caused a decrease of the nby while the nsa remained almost constant propionic acid caused a decrease of the nby and an increase of the nsa as opposed to this both oleic acid and methanol significantly increased the nby in general these compounds are not an impediment for the ppb growth under typical concentrations found in wastewater systems 3 5 effect of inorganic compounds on the ppb metabolism ammonium chlorate and sodium chloride were selected as typical inorganic toxicants potentially affecting the ppb metabolism ammonium as a major nutrient for phototrophic metabolism caused an increase of the activity at low concentrations but decreased the nsa at a threshold of 840 mg l whereas chlorate did not significantly affect the nsa fig 4 regarding the effect over the growth only dissociated sodium caused a relevant inhibition of the nby however the biomass growth almost completely stopped at the higher concentrations tested only around 16 g l which indicates a high tolerance of the ppb culture to salinity 3 6 effect of metal ions on the ppb metabolism metals were separated as an independent group from the inorganic compounds due to their significance in industrial wastewater treatment their effect on the ppb metabolism is summarized in fig 5 surprisingly not all the metals caused inhibition of the spa over the concentration range tested despite the high value of the upper range this indicates the high tolerance of ppb to several metals however some metals caused a strong inhibition of the activity specifically cu2 fe2 and ni2 causing a complete cessation of the activity at concentrations of 5 1 28 2 and 22 9 mg l respectively these concentrations can appear in the liquid fraction of manure or in petrochemical wastewater see table 1 so they should be monitored in wastewater treatment applications by ppb the effect of metals on the ppb growth is depicted in fig 5 cu2 inhibited the ppb growth and the activity causing a cessation of the growth at a concentration of 5 1 mgcu l however the ppb culture was resistant to the toxicity of ni2 which only stopped the biomass growth at the highest concentration tested of 22 9 mg l concurrently with the cessation of the activity interestingly this was not the case with fe2 which hampered the ppb growth at all tested concentrations these results encourage the detailed analysis of the effect of metals on activity and growth 3 7 statistical analysis and modelling of acute inhibitory effects data from batch experiments have been used to estimate the inhibitory effects on the activity and growth of the mixed ppb cultures in cases of significant inhibition the modified version of the hill equation was used to calculate inhibitory kinetic parameters these parameters are useful for kinetic models and increase the predictive power of potential inhibitory events a summary of the statistical analysis and model parameters is shown in table 2 this table also includes the thresholds for complete activity and growth inhibitions for each compound tested the complete description of the significance analysis for the linear regression is included in supporting information while oleic acid and chlorate had negligible effects at the tested concentrations all other tested compounds significantly affected the activity the growth or both the inhibition of the specific activity is somewhat dependent on the type of the chemical compound for the aromatic compounds the modified hill model was able to accurately calculate inhibitory concentrations where 246tcp was the most potent inhibitor k i 23 2 mg l followed by sulfathiazole k i 65 17 mg l 4np k i 97 12 mg l and phenol with a moderate inhibition k i 85 17 mg l but basal activity of 46 the inhibition mode parameter i mode was relatively high for all the compounds but sulfathiazole indicating a strong cliff effect of the aromatics on the inhibitory action as opposed to the aromatic compounds aliphatic organics except methanol were non inhibitory in fact compounds such as propionic acid and ethanol significantly increased the specific activity inorganics ammonium chlorate and sodium were not particularly harmful for the activity only ammonium caused a measurable inhibition k i 873 108 mg l with an intense cliff effect as due to the high inhibition mode i mode 567 371 mg l in contrast all metals inhibited the activity and the modified hill equation was applied successfully except for zn2 and al3 the model was able to predict the inhibitory effects accurately considering the inhibition constant and toxicity threshold copper was the most toxic metal followed by fe ii ni fe iii zn and al where the modified hill equation was applied the i mode parameter was high enough to consider a relevant cliff effect on the inhibitory action the inhibition of the growth was independent from the activity in most of the cases there were only a few cases where the inhibition of activity and growth were statistically similar 246tcp and copper yielding similar values of k i and i mode in contrast there were some compounds that were mildly inhibitory for the growth but were inhibitory or toxic for the activity e g phenol sulfathiazole methanol iron iii zinc nickel and aluminum and others that were highly toxic for microbial growth but the effect over activity was lower 4np propionic acid iron ii or even non existent tce this indicates an uncoupling of substrate uptake and growth in most of the cases with specific inhibitory effects as will be further discussed 4 discussion 4 1 significance despite the treatment of a large list of wastewater types by ppb based treatment has been described in the literature in recent works there is still a big knowledge gap on the effect of typical wastewater constituents on the metabolism of these microorganisms especially when using mixed cultures this work describes acute macroscopic and measurable effects of different organic and inorganic compounds over mixed cultures of ppb the selection of the potentially inhibitory compounds and concentration ranges responds to their presence in wastewater sources potentially treatable by ppb as shown in table 1 this section discusses the mechanisms and implications that these findings entail for the wastewater treatment by ppb specifically focused on resource recovery 4 2 mechanistic analysis of the inhibition analysis of the inhibition mechanisms was performed by contrasting the inhibition over substrate uptake activity and biomass yield growth fig 6 shows the relationship between the npa and the nby values calculated for all the experiments performed at increasing concentrations of every inhibitor this relationship may help to elucidate the mechanism of the inhibition for inorganic compounds such as chlorate ammonium zn2 and al3 the inhibitory effects over npa and nby are not coupled and a more detailed analysis is therefore needed to elucidate the inhibition mechanisms the ppb culture was proven to be resistant to concentrations of chlorate as high as 100 mg l this compound is a strong specific inhibitor of some microorganisms especially to nitrate reducing organisms including some microalgae rusmana and nedwell 2004 however it has been demonstrated that some ppb species can reduce chlorate and nitrate simultaneously as an electron sink roldan et al 1994 regarding ammonium its inhibitory nature is aligned with the uncoupling of redox processes at the photosystem level which clearly affects the energy availability for the central substrate metabolism this has been demonstrated for the photosystem ii of cyanobacteria lovyagina and semin 2016 which share a similar structure with the pheophytin quinone type photosystem of purple bacteria allen and williams 1998 ammonium can decouple the electron transfer from water to a final acceptor 2 6 dichlorophenolindophenol and this mechanism became evident at a concentration around 1200 mg nh4 l lovyagina and semin 2016 the mechanism may be similar for ppb but the decouple of electron transfer might happen at the interface between the tca and the electron transport chain the case of zn2 and al3 are particularly interesting as the ppb culture was very resistant to the toxicity of both metals despite the classifications as strong toxicants for most other microorganisms narendrula kotha et al 2019 some authors reported the potential of ppb for metal recovery due to their inherent metal accumulation capacity buccolieri et al 2006 especially in the case of zn2 magnin et al 2014 a coupled decrease of the npa and nby for increasing inhibitors concentration means a general unspecific toxic effect of the compound on the metabolism as the toxicant affects both the substrate uptake rate as well as the biomass yield this was the case with 246tcp and cu2 despite the potential use of 246tcp as a substrate for ppb the interaction with acetate caused a strong inhibition of the activity and growth yao et al 2011 the toxicity mechanism for copper is different implying strong inhibition of photosynthetic reaction centers at concentrations as low as 0 13 mgcu2 l which inhibits the photophosphorylation jaime pÃ©rez et al 2019 however the microbial response to the toxicity of these different compounds was similar unspecific toxicants like 246tcp and cu2 might cause the excretion of extracellular polymeric substances to withstand chemical stress which has been reported to considerably reduce the metabolic effort towards substrate uptake and biosynthesis sheng et al 2005 a stronger inhibitory effect over the nby than over the npa implies that the growth became uncoupled from the substrate uptake this was the case with tce 4np and fe2 roldÃ¡n et al 1994 indicated that ppb are not affected by the toxicity of 4np when ammonium and acetate are present which is in disagreement with the results presented in this work however nitrophenols are typical strong uncouplers of bacterial growth moreland 1980 the mechanism for photosynthetic bacteria is related to the inhibition of the photosynthesis by binding with quinones in the photosystem ii thus preventing energy and reductive power production to be used for the calvin cycle fuerst and norman 1991 the cases of fe2 and tce are particularly interesting as there are no mechanisms proposed in the literature explaining their uncoupling nature for ppb so far in microaerophilic conditions it has been claimed that 20 mgfe2 l can enhance the specific activity of mixed ppb cultures wu et al 2012 however the presence of oxygen in the samples can strongly affect the oxidation state of fe and therefore the authors did not consider the potential fe2 oxidation to fe3 since their analytical equipment did not allow for fe2 fe3 speciation in any case their results are not applicable to photo anaerobic conditions a toxicant inhibiting the npa more strongly than the nby is a specific inhibitor of the substrate uptake rate examples are sulfathiazole ni2 and fe3 sulfathiazole a member of the sulphonamides family is a strong inhibitor of the photosynthesis biaÅk bieliÅska et al 2011 however this compound caused stimulation of the ppb growth efficiency as ppb needed less substrate to growth this may be due as a result of a general change of growth strategy of the mixed culture where opportunists have a better niche to proliferate vadstein et al 2018 in the case of fe3 and ni2 both metals are key components of the metabolic machinery of ppb ni is a key component of the bacteriochlorophyll a and the light harvesting complex i and is an important part together with fe of the hydrogenase complex visschers et al 1991 ogata et al 2010 indeed it has been previously demonstrated that photosynthetic bacteria can accumulate and store metals like fe ni and cd as micronutrient reservoirs itoh et al 1998 this may explain the high tolerance of ppb to these metals the reduced npa with little no effect on the nby may be due to the increase in the diversion of energy to promote the active transport of the metallic elements into the cell this can be explained by the active hydrolysis of atp coming from the central metabolism by abc transporters to maintain a constant flux of transition metals into the cell this is one of the most endergonic mechanism existing in bacterial metabolism klein and lewinson 2011 there are some cases where the inhibitory action is not evident as the effects are only moderately negative or even positive this may be viewed as a modification of the metabolic strategy this occurs when increasing concentrations of the studied compound enhance either the npa or the nby and only moderately affect to the other one this happens in the presence organic compounds like phenol methanol oleic acid propionic acid and ethanol the ppb culture responds to the presence of the organics by decreasing the metabolic effort towards growth as in the case of propionic acid or increasing the efficiency of the growth as observed for phenol methanol and oleic acid synergistic growth within the microbial communities may explain metabolic shifts especially when the organic substrate is complex and requires the collaboration of more than one species for the degradation deng and wang 2016 for methanol and phenol the trends of the biomass yields have wide variability and therefore we consider that it is not reliable to adventure a specific mechanistic explanation in the case of oleic acid it is quite possible that its low solubility may underestimate its real concentration in the liquid phase expressed as cod but its active uptake by ppb resulted in an increase of the insoluble biomass expressed as vss however it is quite possible that the own ppb may modify the central metabolic pathways due to the presence of new organic substrates this is due to the high versatility of metabolic routes that ppb can use in anaerobic phototrophy like the tca cycle the ethyl malonyl pathway or the glyoxylate shunt in some species tang et al 2011 in any case the presence of more than one organic substrate may cause interactions between the organic toxicants with the main organic substrate and these are key to understand the inhibitory mechanism organic substrates compete with the main substrate acetate this is exemplified by the effect of the organics concentration on the normalized acetate specific uptake rate which is shown in fig 7 there was no clear effect of oleic acid and methanol over the acetate uptake rate data not shown in the cases of propionic acid phenol and ethanol increasing concentrations of these compounds systematically decreased the acetate uptake rate however the interaction between the substrates is not the same for all these co substrates this is evidenced by comparing the fit of the data to the modified hill equation which represents a non competitive interaction between substrates with the simulation of a simple competitive equation eq 5 the mechanism of the interaction between phenol and ethanol with acetate is clearly non competitive as the modified hill equation fits the experimental data much better both phenolic compounds and alcohols have been defined previously as unspecific non competitive inhibitors of the bacterial metabolism at membrane level sikkema et al 1995 however in the case of propionic acid there are no significant differences between the fit of the modified hill equation and the competitive equation p value 0 05 in both cases a previous work emphasized the competitive nature of the inhibition of propionate over the acetate metabolism in rhodobacter sphaeroides propionyl co a from propionate catabolism competes with coenzyme a for the active center of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex which ultimately affects the growth of ppb on acetate maruyama and kitamura 1985 thereby the competitive nature of the inhibition of propionate to acetate uptake is more likely 4 3 implications for biological wastewater treatment by ppb this work demonstrates that the presence of toxicants in wastewater impacts both nby and npa ultimately affecting the performance of the photo anaerobic process and the metabolic behavior of the mixed ppb culture it is important to understand the inherent mechanisms in order to elucidate the potential effects on the process the photo anaerobic processes for wastewater treatment are not merely related to the decontamination of the wastewater but also for resource recovery transformation puyol et al 2017b one potential application for ppb technology is the production of single cell proteins e g using wastewater with high n concentrations the toxic effect of ammonium on the ppb activity must be considered during the operation of the reactors the catabolic uncoupling effects detected here are also of interest in proteins production studies the mixed ppb cultures can growth at lower rate at high concentrations of typical elements of high n load wastewater as sulphonamides and metals like ni and fe iii e g slaughterhouse wastewater piggery or livestock wastewater and are resistant to other metals like zn and al however the cu2 and fe2 which are typical components of these wastewaters should be monitored though inhibitory data regarding toxicity of metals have not been reported for mixed cultures of ppb it is necessary to detail the inhibitory mechanism or even the effect of mixtures of metals on the ppb metabolism for example in a previous study a synergistic toxic effect of fe2 and cu2 has been detected using a pure culture of rhodopseudomonas palustris bird et al 2013 another key point for single cell proteins production is the homogeneity of the produced product as the ppb mixed cultures can modify their metabolic strategy upon a modification of the organic composition of the wastewater e g in the case of propionic acid phenol methanol ethanol and oleic acid it is highly probable that the proteins composition may change as well an effort towards maintaining the wastewater composition as homogeneous as possible is therefore required in order to avoid marketing problems of the single cell proteins based products delamare deboutteville et al 2019 bioplastics like polyhydroxyalkanoates pha are another potential product to obtain from ppb based technologies the typical strategy to increase the pha content of photo anaerobic cultures involves the limitation of the growth induced by limiting key micronutrients under such circumstances ppb use the organic substrate mainly for the transformation into organic acids and the subsequent accumulation as phas fradinho et al 2016 2019 however a very interesting finding of this paper is the anabolic uncoupling nature of some components this is the case with tce and more interestingly fe2 the controlled addition of these components in a wastewater treatment focused on the pha production may increase the pha content considerably as these components specifically inhibits microbial growth but not the substrate uptake thereby this enables the production of pha even from wastewater sources that are rich in micronutrients ppb have been claimed as a potential mediator to accumulate metals from high metal load wastewater with organic composition buccolieri et al 2006 like semiconductor wastewater landfill leachates wood industry wastewater and wastewater from tanneries and other dye user textile industries barakat 2011 as previously mentioned ppb cultures are highly resistant to the toxicity of metals like zn2 al3 ni2 fe3 but caution is required in the presence of cu2 and fe2 the competitive or non competitive nature of the inhibitory effects of some organics towards the acetate metabolism e g propionate ethanol and phenol is especially relevant as the organic compounds analyzed here are not only very typical in wastewater treatment systems but also in effluents coming from other biological processes as vfas and alcohols coming from fermentation therefore the prediction of the competition between substrates is of utmost importance in novel bio refinery platforms where ppb may play a prominent role in the future 5 conclusions the toxic and inhibitory boundaries for the wastewater treatment with mixed cultures of ppb have been analyzed the remarks are 246tcp is the most toxic organic compound assayed and critically affects both the activity and growth of mixed ppb cultures 4np also strongly affected the ppb metabolism but with a strong cliff effect indicating a clear threshold for the inhibitory action tce strongly inhibited growth with no effect on the substrate activity inversely sulfathiazole affected the ppb activity with no apparent effect on the growth the ppb cultures were resistant to the toxicity of some metals and only cu fe ii and ni were strong inhibitors of the activity of ppb ammonium inhibited the specific activity but not the growth a novel inhibitory equation is proposed as an inhibition predictor this equation can upgrade current ppb models and improve the simulation for process specific applications thereby optimizing the reactor design and operation ammonium sulphonamides and metals like ni fe iii zn and al decoupled the substrate uptake from the growth this allows single cell proteins production at lower rate while avoiding process inhibition decouplers of bacterial growth are tce and fe ii which can likely be used to improve the pha production with ppb as the microbial growth can be conveniently tuned without the need of limiting specific nutrients declaration of competing interest the authors

17747,the development of novel wastewater platforms should include the analysis of the most critical functional factors including the effects of toxic or inhibitory substances due to the novelty of purple phototrophic bacteria ppb based wastewater treatment systems this analysis has not been done yet in mixed cultures in this work various relevant chemical compounds including aromatic phenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol or 246tcp 4 nitrophenol or 4cp sulfathiazole and aliphatic organics methanol trichlorethylene or tce oleic acid ethanol propionic acid inorganic salts ammonium clo3 na and metals fe3 fe2 cu2 zn2 ni2 al3 as well as ph are analyzed for their effect on mixed ppb cultures in anaerobic photoheterotrophic conditions using acetate as the model organic substrate the most toxic substances detected were 246tcp 4np cu2 fe2 and ni2 k i for activity 23 2 97 12 3 1 0 4 13 3 13 1 mg l and k i or toxicity threshold for growth 17 2 119 3 5 0 4 4 8 22 9 mg l respectively some substances inhibited the activity more than the growth sulfathiazole ni2 and fe3 or the growth more than the activity tce 4np and fe2 in addition some organic substrates such as phenol ethanol and propionate specifically inhibited the acetate uptake being noncompetitive in the case of phenol and ethanol and most likely competitive in the case of propionate these findings are relevant for the wastewater treatment and resource recovery applications of the ppb technology as well as for the upgrading of current models photo anaerobic model in addition the data will open possibilities to promote the production of specific compounds as pha or single cell proteins by selectively inhibiting some parts of the ppb metabolism graphical abstract image 1 keywords purple phototrophic bacteria inhibition toxicity resource recovery 1 introduction the development of novel wastewater treatment technologies and the industrial scale up can be affected by several factors these include limited scalability high costs capital and operational as well as operational drawbacks such as inconsistent removal performances due to varying types of wastewaters and compositions da silva and reis 2015 all of these have affected and sometimes delayed the application of several treatment technologies examples include anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and microalgae based processes for the first anammox full scale it took nearly a decade to achieve stable performance at design removal loads van der star et al 2007 while microalgae based process after 50 years of research are still affected by sudden predation flynn et al 2017 and general culture instabilities da silva and reis 2015 pragya et al 2013 even long established conventional processes activated sludge and biological nutrient removal are still affected by episodes of sludge bulking and foaming pal et al 2014 martins et al 2004 while anaerobic system can be affected by sludge washout due to various reasons daud et al 2018 and are generally affected by high ammonia loads that considerably limits their applicability jiang et al 2019 in this context emerging purple phototrophic bacteria ppb based wastewater treatment is likely to experience various operational problems towards final scale up and application while some might be related to the reactor design which to date is still being assessed puyol et al 2020 others might very well be related to the chemical composition of the wastewater from other emerging biological processes some of the potential inhibitory components include nitrophenols trichlorethylene tce sulfathiazole chlorate or long chain fatty acids lcfa nitrophenols decouple metabolism in microalgae fuerst and norman 1991 while sulfathiazole inhibits the oxygenic photosynthesis biaÅk bieliÅska et al 2011 tce specifically inhibits nitrifying bacteria especially ammonium oxidation fuller and scow 1997 while chlorate inhibits nitrate reduction rusmana and nedwell 2004 in addition lcfa cause failure of anaerobic digestion by specifically binding in membranes of methanogens dasa et al 2016 therefore all of these components affect specific biological processes found in wastewater treatment technologies however none of these has been assessed for ppb specifically while some are likely to affect ppb due to the general mode of action others are not or the effects cannot be extrapolated due to fundamental metabolic differences in addition these compounds are typical in wastewater sources potentially treatable by ppb and concentrations are highly variable depending on the wastewater type as listed in table 1 other potentially inhibitory compounds belongs to the family of substituted and non substituted aromatics organic substrates as alcohols volatile and non volatile organic acids as well as inorganic compounds like ammonium sodium and transition metals which are also included in table 1 nevertheless the toxicities of some metals and pesticides over pure ppb cultures have been assessed to an extent previous works have demonstrated toxic effects of cu and cd on the photosynthetic apparatus zhuo et al 2017 jaime pÃ©rez et al 2019 however toxicities seem to be species dependent and while some species are resistant and have been proposed to be a heavy metal removal mediators rhodobacter sphaeroides others are completely inhibited at ni co cr and mo concentrations of 47 22 2015 and 18 mg l respectively buccolieri et al 2006 similar findings were reported for pesticides while several families of herbicides like triazines nitrophenols nitriles and pyridazinones were reported to inhibit the photosystem ii electron transport chain in ppb genera like rhodopseudomonas and rhodobacter fuerst and norman 1991 other authors published toxicological data indicating that ppb can tolerate up to 2 6 mg l of pesticides such as triclosan compared to ec50 values between 0 01 and 0 1 mg l for other photosynthetic microorganisms e g microalgae johansson et al 2014 there are a few studies analyzing the inhibitory effect of organic substrates as propionate and substituted phenols on the growth of ppb species witte et al 1998 maruyama and kitamura 1985 escher et al 1996 however there is a patent lack of studies on the inhibitory effect of phenol over ppb species and it has been shown as a good substrate for hydrogen production in e g rhodopseudomonas palustris shi et al 2015 in any case almost all of these works deal with pure cultures of ppb and the information regarding the inhibitory effect of organic or inorganic compounds over ppb mixed cultures is limited to a few works wu et al 2012 laurinavichene et al 2013 mixed cultures are known to exert increased resistance over stress situations caused by chemical or physical disturbances allison and martiny 2008 this is strongly motivated by the improved resilience and the inherent capability of bacteria to interact each other garcia 2016 in a previous work a mixed ppb culture showed a strong resilience against a toxic stress caused by a sudden increase of the organic loading rate of a synthetic wastewater containing a mixture of inhibitory organic compounds de las heras et al 2020 this resilience enlarges the resistance of mixed cultures to chemical toxicity compared with pure cultures bachenheimer and bennett 1961 in this context details about the quantitative and qualitative inhibitory effects of common wastewater components such as volatile fatty acids alcohols substituted phenols metals inorganic salts or long chain fatty acids on ppb mixed cultures remain unknown however the knowledge about the effects of these components on mixed ppb cultures is essential and it will enable the optimization of wastewater treatment and resource recovery with ppb eventually facilitating the scale up this work aims to analyze the inhibitory effect of a wide list of typical wastewater components on mixed ppb cultures the effects are measured and quantified by using a statistical approach and when possible inhibitory parameters are calculated the inhibitory limiting mechanisms are then discussed in order to propose solutions to enhance the capabilities of ppb for wastewater treatment with a specific focus on resource recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 origin of the cultures mixed ppb cultures were enriched from domestic wastewater obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant in mostoles spain spanish mixed culture smc or from brisbane australia australian mixed culture amc for the smc the wastewater was supplemented with 2 gcod l of a mixture of acetate propionate butyrate ethanol and yeast extract in a cod ratio of 1 1 1 1 0 1 ammonium chloride and sodium dihydrogen phosphate were added to reach a cod n p ratio of 100 7 5 1 5 the culture was cultivated in 10 l iso bottles during 7 days in anaerobic conditions ph 7 5 and a temperature of 33 6 0 8 c illuminated with 150 w infrared lamps and covered with vis uv filters providing 100 w m2 of nir irradiance following enrichment for analytical and inoculum purposes the culture was continuously stirred at 500 rpm in a 10 l schott bottle and fed weekly with 90 fresh wastewater under the above described conditions for the amc acetic acid 500 mgcod l was added as carbon source following enrichment the culture was continuously stirred at 500 rpm in a 10 l schott bottle and fed weekly with 90 fresh wastewater under the above described conditions in order to check for the consistent enrichment of the inoculum biomass samples from the inoculum were analyzed for the vis nir spectrum over a 400 900 nm range 2 2 inhibitory batch tests inhibition batch tests were conducted in 160 ml serum bottles the growth medium was prepared from stock solutions of macronutrients trace elements and organic source at ph 7 according to a previous work puyol et al 2017a acetate at 500 mgcod l was the sole organic carbon source and was added from a stock solution of acetate of 20 gcod l at ph 7 experimental basis for this relies on the assumption that there are no other potential microbial processes capable of uptaking acetate in anaerobic conditions without the presence of other electron acceptors like nitrite nitrate sulfate or oxidized metals in fact the only preeminent process that can sustain grow on acetate in these experimental conditions is acetoclastic methanogenesis which is a much slower process and the competition with ppb for the acetate would be almost non existent as has been previously pointed out puyol et al 2017 the medium was inoculated with 200 mgvss l of ppb mixed cultures and was subsequently supplemented with the toxicants of study in a different concentrations range as specified in table 2 initial ph was then fixed at 7 0 except for the assays where the initial ph effect was explored ph values set at 5 6 7 2 8 5 and 10 where the toxicant is included in the medium composition concentrations range in table 2 represents the extra addition of the toxicant an additional experiment with no toxicant was also prepared as a control thus every inhibitory assay had its own control test preparation of batch experiments was performed according to puyol et al 2017a the experiments were carried out in a 120 rpm temperature controlled shaker at 30 c illuminated with 150 w infrared lamps and covered with vis uv filters providing an average of 100 w m2 of nir irradiance liquid raw samples 3 5 ml were extracted several times during each assay to measure total cod part of the raw samples was filtered through 0 7 Î¼m glass fiber syringe filters when the toxicants were aromatic compounds or 0 44 Î¼m cellulose syringe filters in the rest of the cases to measure soluble cod consumption and to analyze the evolution of volatile fatty acids vfa ammonium and the inhibitory organics initial and final samples were also extracted to measure ph and total and volatile suspended solids tss vss 2 3 analytical methods total and soluble cod and tss vss were measured following standard procedures apha 2005 nh4 was measured by merck kits merck darmstadt germany data of ammonium concentration was independent from the ph and thereby ammonium is referred in this work to total ammonia nitrogen tan irradiance was measured with a spectroradiometer stn bluewave vis nir stellarnet tampa usa the vis nir 400 950 nm absorbance spectra was performed by vis nir spectrometry v 630 jasco madrid spain aromatic organics were measured by hplc dad according to melero et al 2007 by using a varian prostar 350 apparatus agilent technologies santa clara usa vfas and alcohols were measured by hplc ir following vasiliadou et al 2018 by using a varian 356 lc agilent technologies santa clara usa 2 4 data handling and statistical analysis dissociation of acid base pairs was simulated by using the software visual minteq 3 1 in order to simulate the effect of the presence of microorganisms over the inorganic s speciation and the chemical equilibrium at the beginning of the toxicity tests a 1 1 mixture of solid humic and fulvic acids at 200 mg l was added into the speciation model following the stockholm humic model solid humic and fulvic substances are complex organic nitrogen containing compounds with functional properties similar to microbial biomass marsac et al 2017 subsequently the model was run and the soluble precipitated and adsorbed species were recorded the sum of all the soluble species were considered as bioavailable for the microorganisms and thereby were used as the initial concentration values of the inorganic toxicants for the estimation of the inhibitory parameters this theoretical calculation has been checked with real soluble data of some metals at the beginning of the experiments which validated the assumptions made in the simulation see supplementary information for more details activity and growth are expressed as specific phototrophic activity spa in gcod gvss d and apparent biomass yield y x s in gvss gcod and were calculated dynamically by using the data from triplicate experiments for each concentration of the toxicant compound and the controls concerning the time course of scod and the initial and final vss values this data was fitted to a simple monod model where the saturation constant k s mgcod l was fixed at 20 mgcod l according to a previous work puyol et al 2017a the model leads to the calculation of the specific substrate consumption rate k m gcod gvss d which corresponds to the spa values and the y x s the model was implemented in aquasim 2 1d more details are provided in supplementary information normalized phototrophic activities npa and normalized biomass yield nby values were calculated based on the spa and y x s from the controls as follows 1 n p a s p a i s p a c 2 n b y y x s i y x s c where the indexes i and c represent the values for the i concentration of the toxicant and the values for the controls respectively normalized values were useful for the comparison between the different toxicity experiments as the values of the control experiments had some variability the correlation between the npa nby and the concentration of the toxicants was estimated by linear regression where positive or negative effects were associated to the slope of the linear regression at 95 confidence p value 0 05 additionally in those assays where the inhibitor was a biodegradable organic compound phenol propionate methanol ethanol and oleic acid which may potentially compete with acetate as substrate the normalized specific acetate uptake rate has been estimated dynamically following the same methodology described for the npa and nby in this case the specific acetate uptake rate has units of mgcod acetate mgvss d whereas the y x acetate units are mgvss mgcod acetate normalization was also carried out as described previously values of npa and nby of all the individual experiments were analyzed for the significance of the effects of the toxicant we used this method instead of the analysis of the significance for the averages from triplicates as some individual experiments were lost during the experimental stage linear correlations were performed over the whole data set and analysis of variance fisher matrix was used to check for the significance of the slope of the linear regression at 0 05 level a direct plot of npa against nby provides evidences on the inhibition nature of the tested compounds as it predicts whether the inhibitory effects over activity or growth are coupled or uncoupled as will be further analyzed in the section 4 2 2 5 modeling inhibitory processes where the correlation between npa nby and the concentration of the toxicant was significantly negative which evidences a negative effect data was fitted to a novel inhibition equation described in the eq 3 which is derived from the hill functions 3 n p a 1 1 i k i 2 k i k i i mode in the eq 3 the k i represents the non competitive inhibitory constant mg toxicant l and the new parameter i mode represents the inhibition type with values ranging between k i and k i when i mode k i the hill function becomes the typical non competitive function when k i i mode 0 there is no threshold in the inhibitory action for any increase of the inhibitor concentration the rate decreases significantly when i mode 0 the hill function becomes the typical 2 factor non competitive function when 0 i mode k i a threshold appears below that the inhibitor causes no significant effect on the rate cliff effect the i mode appears to be a minimum concentration of the inhibitor for the inhibition to be significant npa lower than 0 9 thereby i mode indicates the secure concentration of the inhibitor for avoiding inhibitory effects the derivation of the eq 3 is presented in the supplementary information this equation is proposed as a new inhibitory equation that can replace the non competitive equation and the hill functions in this new equation all the parameters have a physical meaning both k i and i mode represent inhibitor concentrations which differs from hill functions where exponentials are not associated to the physical nature of the experiment and therefore are empirical parameters in addition the non competitive equation is unable to predict a cliff effect the eq 3 have been updated in some cases to cover the situation where the toxicant does not stop completely the activity and the relationship between the npa values with the concentration of the compound follows asymptotically to a value higher than 0 this value corresponds to the minimum npa achieved irrespective of the toxicant concentration npa bas we modified the eq 3 in a way that inhibitory parameters are still possible to be calculated the eq 3 becomes in those cases eq 4 4 n p a 1 n p a b a s n p a c 1 1 i k i 2 k i k i i mode n p a b a s n p a c fitting experimental data to eqs 3 and 4 has been performed in originpro 2016 by using the levenberg marquardt algorithm damped least squares where the standard error in the parameter s estimation is calculated according to the error propagation formula confidence intervals were calculated by using the asymptotic symmetry method with a significance level Î± of 0 05 the data from the normalized specific acetate uptake rate obtained from the experiments where the toxicants are biodegradable organics were also compared with the competitive function which is described in eq 5 in this equation s ac and s i are the initial concentrations of acetate mgcod l and the organic inhibitor mgcod l respectively comparison between experimental data and simulation performed by using the eq 5 was performed by calculating the coefficient of correlation of spearman and significance of the difference was evaluated by confidence analysis with p value 0 05 5 n p a 1 s a c s i s a c 3 results 3 1 characterization of mixed cultures of ppb the smc and amc cultures were planktonic or micro granular bacterial aggregations with intense purple color the biomass vis nir absorbance spectra showed characteristic peaks at wavelengths around 400 550 nm carotenoids and three prominent peaks at 600 805 and 865 nm bacteriochlorophyll a the ratio between absorbance at 805 to absorbance at 660 nm abs805 abs660 was 1 19 0 07 which also gives a strong support about the uniformity of the inoculum and strong dominance of ppb as previously stated de las heras et al 2020 this indicates the successful enrichment of the ppb cultures puyol et al 2017a the spa values averaged 1 9 0 3 mgcod mgvss d with an average biomass yield of 0 62 0 08 mgvss mgcod similar to results described in the literature puyol et al 2017a hÃ¼lsen et al 2016 these cultures were used for all the inhibitory tests 3 2 effect of ph on the ppb metabolism the ph determines the speciation of the organic and inorganic salts the ionic potential through membranes and the reactivity of acidic and basic components kodukula et al 2018 it is necessary to control the ph to avoid hidden factors in inhibitory assays that can mask main findings as for example un dissociation of salts that can cause toxicity or precipitation of key nutrients that can hinder microbial growth carvajal arroyo et al 2013 zandvoort et al 2006 the effect of different ph was analyzed prior to all other tests to set the initial ph fig 1 shows the effect of ph on the nsa and the normalized biomass growth yield the ppb metabolism is quite stable at a ph range between 6 0 and 8 5 with negligible effects on both the nsa and the normalized biomass growth yield however extreme ph values 5 and 9 slightly affected the nsa and strongly reduce the nby chemical stressing conditions are suggested to be the main reason for low biomass yields the apparent biomass yield includes the use of substrate for maintenance energy production through catabolism via tri carboxylic acid tca cycle when the substrate is mainly use for maintenance low biomass yield is achieved this can be only possible by dissipating the excess of reductants in a dedicated pathway to allow for atp production it has been demonstrated that even in the presence of ammonium some ppb species as rba capsulatus are able to derepress the dinitrogenase protein accumulation which allows to remove the excess of reducing equivalents in the form of hydrogen gas tichi and tabita 2000 the fit of the experimental data to a gaussian model resulted in optimum ph values of 7 1 0 4 and 7 2 0 3 and amplitude values of 2 9 0 7 and 1 7 0 4 for the nsa and nby respectively this indicates that the ppb metabolism is not significantly affected at a ph range between 6 5 and 8 5 thereby all the experiments started with a ph of 7 0 which naturally increased to around 8 0 8 5 due to the consumption of the acetic acid and the additional organic substrates see more details in supporting information table s1 consequently the ph is discarded as an inhibitory factor in all cases 3 3 effect of aromatic organic compounds on the ppb metabolism aromatic organics are persistent pollutants that inhibit microorganisms typically present in wastewater treatment plants but they may also act as organic substrate cao et al 2009 fig 2 shows the effect of specific phenol derivatives on the metabolism of mixed ppb cultures at different initial concentrations regarding the effect on the activity 246tcp and 4np strongly inhibited the nsa the cultures were completely inhibited at concentrations above 50 and 200 mg l of 246tcp and 4np respectively however the inhibitory effect caused by 246tcp was incremental whereas 4np caused a sudden and very strong decrease of the activity at concentrations higher than 100 mg l cliff effect sulfathiazole caused a moderate inhibitory effect starting from the lowest concentration of 5 mg l in the case of phenol a strong inhibition at concentrations lower than 100 mg l was followed by a constant nsa at higher concentrations this indicates that the inhibitory mechanism of sulfathiazole and phenol is different from that caused by 246tcp and 4 cp fig 2 also shows the effect of these organics on the growth of the phototrophic cultures both sulfathiazole and phenol had minor impacts on the ppb growth at the tested concentrations ranges increasing concentrations of both compounds caused a significant increase of the biomass growth which may indicate usage as substrate this is further discussed below however both 246tcp and 4 cp resulted in complete growth inhibition at concentrations as low as 25 and 120 mg l respectively so these compounds are strong inhibitors of ppb biomass yield 3 4 effect of aliphatic organic compounds on the ppb metabolism the effects of some typical aliphatic organic compounds on the metabolism of mixed ppb cultures are shown in fig 3 in general aliphatic organics were mildly inhibitory for the specific activity with the exception of ethanol which was inhibitory of the nsa at values beyond 2000 mg l even propionic acid significantly improved the nsa over the concentration range tested and ethanol increased the nsa at concentrations below 2000 mg l this suggests that these act as co substrates as is further discussed below the effects of aliphatic organics on the growth yield differed especially in the case of tce and propionic acid increasing concentrations of tce caused a decrease of the nby while the nsa remained almost constant propionic acid caused a decrease of the nby and an increase of the nsa as opposed to this both oleic acid and methanol significantly increased the nby in general these compounds are not an impediment for the ppb growth under typical concentrations found in wastewater systems 3 5 effect of inorganic compounds on the ppb metabolism ammonium chlorate and sodium chloride were selected as typical inorganic toxicants potentially affecting the ppb metabolism ammonium as a major nutrient for phototrophic metabolism caused an increase of the activity at low concentrations but decreased the nsa at a threshold of 840 mg l whereas chlorate did not significantly affect the nsa fig 4 regarding the effect over the growth only dissociated sodium caused a relevant inhibition of the nby however the biomass growth almost completely stopped at the higher concentrations tested only around 16 g l which indicates a high tolerance of the ppb culture to salinity 3 6 effect of metal ions on the ppb metabolism metals were separated as an independent group from the inorganic compounds due to their significance in industrial wastewater treatment their effect on the ppb metabolism is summarized in fig 5 surprisingly not all the metals caused inhibition of the spa over the concentration range tested despite the high value of the upper range this indicates the high tolerance of ppb to several metals however some metals caused a strong inhibition of the activity specifically cu2 fe2 and ni2 causing a complete cessation of the activity at concentrations of 5 1 28 2 and 22 9 mg l respectively these concentrations can appear in the liquid fraction of manure or in petrochemical wastewater see table 1 so they should be monitored in wastewater treatment applications by ppb the effect of metals on the ppb growth is depicted in fig 5 cu2 inhibited the ppb growth and the activity causing a cessation of the growth at a concentration of 5 1 mgcu l however the ppb culture was resistant to the toxicity of ni2 which only stopped the biomass growth at the highest concentration tested of 22 9 mg l concurrently with the cessation of the activity interestingly this was not the case with fe2 which hampered the ppb growth at all tested concentrations these results encourage the detailed analysis of the effect of metals on activity and growth 3 7 statistical analysis and modelling of acute inhibitory effects data from batch experiments have been used to estimate the inhibitory effects on the activity and growth of the mixed ppb cultures in cases of significant inhibition the modified version of the hill equation was used to calculate inhibitory kinetic parameters these parameters are useful for kinetic models and increase the predictive power of potential inhibitory events a summary of the statistical analysis and model parameters is shown in table 2 this table also includes the thresholds for complete activity and growth inhibitions for each compound tested the complete description of the significance analysis for the linear regression is included in supporting information while oleic acid and chlorate had negligible effects at the tested concentrations all other tested compounds significantly affected the activity the growth or both the inhibition of the specific activity is somewhat dependent on the type of the chemical compound for the aromatic compounds the modified hill model was able to accurately calculate inhibitory concentrations where 246tcp was the most potent inhibitor k i 23 2 mg l followed by sulfathiazole k i 65 17 mg l 4np k i 97 12 mg l and phenol with a moderate inhibition k i 85 17 mg l but basal activity of 46 the inhibition mode parameter i mode was relatively high for all the compounds but sulfathiazole indicating a strong cliff effect of the aromatics on the inhibitory action as opposed to the aromatic compounds aliphatic organics except methanol were non inhibitory in fact compounds such as propionic acid and ethanol significantly increased the specific activity inorganics ammonium chlorate and sodium were not particularly harmful for the activity only ammonium caused a measurable inhibition k i 873 108 mg l with an intense cliff effect as due to the high inhibition mode i mode 567 371 mg l in contrast all metals inhibited the activity and the modified hill equation was applied successfully except for zn2 and al3 the model was able to predict the inhibitory effects accurately considering the inhibition constant and toxicity threshold copper was the most toxic metal followed by fe ii ni fe iii zn and al where the modified hill equation was applied the i mode parameter was high enough to consider a relevant cliff effect on the inhibitory action the inhibition of the growth was independent from the activity in most of the cases there were only a few cases where the inhibition of activity and growth were statistically similar 246tcp and copper yielding similar values of k i and i mode in contrast there were some compounds that were mildly inhibitory for the growth but were inhibitory or toxic for the activity e g phenol sulfathiazole methanol iron iii zinc nickel and aluminum and others that were highly toxic for microbial growth but the effect over activity was lower 4np propionic acid iron ii or even non existent tce this indicates an uncoupling of substrate uptake and growth in most of the cases with specific inhibitory effects as will be further discussed 4 discussion 4 1 significance despite the treatment of a large list of wastewater types by ppb based treatment has been described in the literature in recent works there is still a big knowledge gap on the effect of typical wastewater constituents on the metabolism of these microorganisms especially when using mixed cultures this work describes acute macroscopic and measurable effects of different organic and inorganic compounds over mixed cultures of ppb the selection of the potentially inhibitory compounds and concentration ranges responds to their presence in wastewater sources potentially treatable by ppb as shown in table 1 this section discusses the mechanisms and implications that these findings entail for the wastewater treatment by ppb specifically focused on resource recovery 4 2 mechanistic analysis of the inhibition analysis of the inhibition mechanisms was performed by contrasting the inhibition over substrate uptake activity and biomass yield growth fig 6 shows the relationship between the npa and the nby values calculated for all the experiments performed at increasing concentrations of every inhibitor this relationship may help to elucidate the mechanism of the inhibition for inorganic compounds such as chlorate ammonium zn2 and al3 the inhibitory effects over npa and nby are not coupled and a more detailed analysis is therefore needed to elucidate the inhibition mechanisms the ppb culture was proven to be resistant to concentrations of chlorate as high as 100 mg l this compound is a strong specific inhibitor of some microorganisms especially to nitrate reducing organisms including some microalgae rusmana and nedwell 2004 however it has been demonstrated that some ppb species can reduce chlorate and nitrate simultaneously as an electron sink roldan et al 1994 regarding ammonium its inhibitory nature is aligned with the uncoupling of redox processes at the photosystem level which clearly affects the energy availability for the central substrate metabolism this has been demonstrated for the photosystem ii of cyanobacteria lovyagina and semin 2016 which share a similar structure with the pheophytin quinone type photosystem of purple bacteria allen and williams 1998 ammonium can decouple the electron transfer from water to a final acceptor 2 6 dichlorophenolindophenol and this mechanism became evident at a concentration around 1200 mg nh4 l lovyagina and semin 2016 the mechanism may be similar for ppb but the decouple of electron transfer might happen at the interface between the tca and the electron transport chain the case of zn2 and al3 are particularly interesting as the ppb culture was very resistant to the toxicity of both metals despite the classifications as strong toxicants for most other microorganisms narendrula kotha et al 2019 some authors reported the potential of ppb for metal recovery due to their inherent metal accumulation capacity buccolieri et al 2006 especially in the case of zn2 magnin et al 2014 a coupled decrease of the npa and nby for increasing inhibitors concentration means a general unspecific toxic effect of the compound on the metabolism as the toxicant affects both the substrate uptake rate as well as the biomass yield this was the case with 246tcp and cu2 despite the potential use of 246tcp as a substrate for ppb the interaction with acetate caused a strong inhibition of the activity and growth yao et al 2011 the toxicity mechanism for copper is different implying strong inhibition of photosynthetic reaction centers at concentrations as low as 0 13 mgcu2 l which inhibits the photophosphorylation jaime pÃ©rez et al 2019 however the microbial response to the toxicity of these different compounds was similar unspecific toxicants like 246tcp and cu2 might cause the excretion of extracellular polymeric substances to withstand chemical stress which has been reported to considerably reduce the metabolic effort towards substrate uptake and biosynthesis sheng et al 2005 a stronger inhibitory effect over the nby than over the npa implies that the growth became uncoupled from the substrate uptake this was the case with tce 4np and fe2 roldÃ¡n et al 1994 indicated that ppb are not affected by the toxicity of 4np when ammonium and acetate are present which is in disagreement with the results presented in this work however nitrophenols are typical strong uncouplers of bacterial growth moreland 1980 the mechanism for photosynthetic bacteria is related to the inhibition of the photosynthesis by binding with quinones in the photosystem ii thus preventing energy and reductive power production to be used for the calvin cycle fuerst and norman 1991 the cases of fe2 and tce are particularly interesting as there are no mechanisms proposed in the literature explaining their uncoupling nature for ppb so far in microaerophilic conditions it has been claimed that 20 mgfe2 l can enhance the specific activity of mixed ppb cultures wu et al 2012 however the presence of oxygen in the samples can strongly affect the oxidation state of fe and therefore the authors did not consider the potential fe2 oxidation to fe3 since their analytical equipment did not allow for fe2 fe3 speciation in any case their results are not applicable to photo anaerobic conditions a toxicant inhibiting the npa more strongly than the nby is a specific inhibitor of the substrate uptake rate examples are sulfathiazole ni2 and fe3 sulfathiazole a member of the sulphonamides family is a strong inhibitor of the photosynthesis biaÅk bieliÅska et al 2011 however this compound caused stimulation of the ppb growth efficiency as ppb needed less substrate to growth this may be due as a result of a general change of growth strategy of the mixed culture where opportunists have a better niche to proliferate vadstein et al 2018 in the case of fe3 and ni2 both metals are key components of the metabolic machinery of ppb ni is a key component of the bacteriochlorophyll a and the light harvesting complex i and is an important part together with fe of the hydrogenase complex visschers et al 1991 ogata et al 2010 indeed it has been previously demonstrated that photosynthetic bacteria can accumulate and store metals like fe ni and cd as micronutrient reservoirs itoh et al 1998 this may explain the high tolerance of ppb to these metals the reduced npa with little no effect on the nby may be due to the increase in the diversion of energy to promote the active transport of the metallic elements into the cell this can be explained by the active hydrolysis of atp coming from the central metabolism by abc transporters to maintain a constant flux of transition metals into the cell this is one of the most endergonic mechanism existing in bacterial metabolism klein and lewinson 2011 there are some cases where the inhibitory action is not evident as the effects are only moderately negative or even positive this may be viewed as a modification of the metabolic strategy this occurs when increasing concentrations of the studied compound enhance either the npa or the nby and only moderately affect to the other one this happens in the presence organic compounds like phenol methanol oleic acid propionic acid and ethanol the ppb culture responds to the presence of the organics by decreasing the metabolic effort towards growth as in the case of propionic acid or increasing the efficiency of the growth as observed for phenol methanol and oleic acid synergistic growth within the microbial communities may explain metabolic shifts especially when the organic substrate is complex and requires the collaboration of more than one species for the degradation deng and wang 2016 for methanol and phenol the trends of the biomass yields have wide variability and therefore we consider that it is not reliable to adventure a specific mechanistic explanation in the case of oleic acid it is quite possible that its low solubility may underestimate its real concentration in the liquid phase expressed as cod but its active uptake by ppb resulted in an increase of the insoluble biomass expressed as vss however it is quite possible that the own ppb may modify the central metabolic pathways due to the presence of new organic substrates this is due to the high versatility of metabolic routes that ppb can use in anaerobic phototrophy like the tca cycle the ethyl malonyl pathway or the glyoxylate shunt in some species tang et al 2011 in any case the presence of more than one organic substrate may cause interactions between the organic toxicants with the main organic substrate and these are key to understand the inhibitory mechanism organic substrates compete with the main substrate acetate this is exemplified by the effect of the organics concentration on the normalized acetate specific uptake rate which is shown in fig 7 there was no clear effect of oleic acid and methanol over the acetate uptake rate data not shown in the cases of propionic acid phenol and ethanol increasing concentrations of these compounds systematically decreased the acetate uptake rate however the interaction between the substrates is not the same for all these co substrates this is evidenced by comparing the fit of the data to the modified hill equation which represents a non competitive interaction between substrates with the simulation of a simple competitive equation eq 5 the mechanism of the interaction between phenol and ethanol with acetate is clearly non competitive as the modified hill equation fits the experimental data much better both phenolic compounds and alcohols have been defined previously as unspecific non competitive inhibitors of the bacterial metabolism at membrane level sikkema et al 1995 however in the case of propionic acid there are no significant differences between the fit of the modified hill equation and the competitive equation p value 0 05 in both cases a previous work emphasized the competitive nature of the inhibition of propionate over the acetate metabolism in rhodobacter sphaeroides propionyl co a from propionate catabolism competes with coenzyme a for the active center of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex which ultimately affects the growth of ppb on acetate maruyama and kitamura 1985 thereby the competitive nature of the inhibition of propionate to acetate uptake is more likely 4 3 implications for biological wastewater treatment by ppb this work demonstrates that the presence of toxicants in wastewater impacts both nby and npa ultimately affecting the performance of the photo anaerobic process and the metabolic behavior of the mixed ppb culture it is important to understand the inherent mechanisms in order to elucidate the potential effects on the process the photo anaerobic processes for wastewater treatment are not merely related to the decontamination of the wastewater but also for resource recovery transformation puyol et al 2017b one potential application for ppb technology is the production of single cell proteins e g using wastewater with high n concentrations the toxic effect of ammonium on the ppb activity must be considered during the operation of the reactors the catabolic uncoupling effects detected here are also of interest in proteins production studies the mixed ppb cultures can growth at lower rate at high concentrations of typical elements of high n load wastewater as sulphonamides and metals like ni and fe iii e g slaughterhouse wastewater piggery or livestock wastewater and are resistant to other metals like zn and al however the cu2 and fe2 which are typical components of these wastewaters should be monitored though inhibitory data regarding toxicity of metals have not been reported for mixed cultures of ppb it is necessary to detail the inhibitory mechanism or even the effect of mixtures of metals on the ppb metabolism for example in a previous study a synergistic toxic effect of fe2 and cu2 has been detected using a pure culture of rhodopseudomonas palustris bird et al 2013 another key point for single cell proteins production is the homogeneity of the produced product as the ppb mixed cultures can modify their metabolic strategy upon a modification of the organic composition of the wastewater e g in the case of propionic acid phenol methanol ethanol and oleic acid it is highly probable that the proteins composition may change as well an effort towards maintaining the wastewater composition as homogeneous as possible is therefore required in order to avoid marketing problems of the single cell proteins based products delamare deboutteville et al 2019 bioplastics like polyhydroxyalkanoates pha are another potential product to obtain from ppb based technologies the typical strategy to increase the pha content of photo anaerobic cultures involves the limitation of the growth induced by limiting key micronutrients under such circumstances ppb use the organic substrate mainly for the transformation into organic acids and the subsequent accumulation as phas fradinho et al 2016 2019 however a very interesting finding of this paper is the anabolic uncoupling nature of some components this is the case with tce and more interestingly fe2 the controlled addition of these components in a wastewater treatment focused on the pha production may increase the pha content considerably as these components specifically inhibits microbial growth but not the substrate uptake thereby this enables the production of pha even from wastewater sources that are rich in micronutrients ppb have been claimed as a potential mediator to accumulate metals from high metal load wastewater with organic composition buccolieri et al 2006 like semiconductor wastewater landfill leachates wood industry wastewater and wastewater from tanneries and other dye user textile industries barakat 2011 as previously mentioned ppb cultures are highly resistant to the toxicity of metals like zn2 al3 ni2 fe3 but caution is required in the presence of cu2 and fe2 the competitive or non competitive nature of the inhibitory effects of some organics towards the acetate metabolism e g propionate ethanol and phenol is especially relevant as the organic compounds analyzed here are not only very typical in wastewater treatment systems but also in effluents coming from other biological processes as vfas and alcohols coming from fermentation therefore the prediction of the competition between substrates is of utmost importance in novel bio refinery platforms where ppb may play a prominent role in the future 5 conclusions the toxic and inhibitory boundaries for the wastewater treatment with mixed cultures of ppb have been analyzed the remarks are 246tcp is the most toxic organic compound assayed and critically affects both the activity and growth of mixed ppb cultures 4np also strongly affected the ppb metabolism but with a strong cliff effect indicating a clear threshold for the inhibitory action tce strongly inhibited growth with no effect on the substrate activity inversely sulfathiazole affected the ppb activity with no apparent effect on the growth the ppb cultures were resistant to the toxicity of some metals and only cu fe ii and ni were strong inhibitors of the activity of ppb ammonium inhibited the specific activity but not the growth a novel inhibitory equation is proposed as an inhibition predictor this equation can upgrade current ppb models and improve the simulation for process specific applications thereby optimizing the reactor design and operation ammonium sulphonamides and metals like ni fe iii zn and al decoupled the substrate uptake from the growth this allows single cell proteins production at lower rate while avoiding process inhibition decouplers of bacterial growth are tce and fe ii which can likely be used to improve the pha production with ppb as the microbial growth can be conveniently tuned without the need of limiting specific nutrients declaration of competing interest the authors

17748,granular activated carbon gac is widely used by drinking water treatment plants in the great lakes region to control 2 methylisoborneol mib and geosmin associated with summertime algal blooms recently however taste and odour events are being detected in the winter but there is limited information in the literature about the effect of temperature on gac performance in this study batch isotherm experiments were conducted at 4 c 10 c and 20 c to evaluate the temperature impact on adsorption thermodynamics pilot scale column tests were then performed at the same temperatures to evaluate the temperature effect on overall removal including both thermodynamics and kinetics the pore and surface diffusion model psdm was applied to fit the experimental data of the pilot scale column tests which allowed the kinetic parameters to be determined at each temperature the isotherm results showed that water temperature did not have a significant effect on the equilibrium adsorption capacity i e the thermodynamics for mib and geosmin under the conditions tested but the pilot tests showed an increased removal of mib and geosmin by 20 30 at 20 c compared to the lower temperatures this demonstrates that water temperature has more impact on kinetics than thermodynamics numerical simulations showed that the overall external mass transfer coefficient k f had the greatest impact on breakthrough an exponential equation was proposed to correlate temperature and k f and it could be incorporated into a site specific psdm to predict the removals of mib and geosmin in gac contactors at different temperatures the model could then be used by a utility for example to predict the required increase in empty bed contact time needed to control taste and odour in the winter to the same extent as in the summer graphical abstract image 1 keywords 2 methylisoborneol geosmin granular activated carbon adsorption temperature 1 introduction in the great lakes region granular activated carbon gac contactors are widely used by drinking water treatment plants to control 2 methylisoborneol mib and geosmin these taste and odour causing compounds have historically been associated with algal blooms that occur in the summer or early fall when water temperatures are at their highest around 20 c in recent years however there are increasing reports of taste and odour events in the winter possibly due to climate change that is leading to fewer days of ice cover in the winter and more frequent winter storms for example parinet et al 2010 reported concentrations of up to 15 ng l mib in three drinking water sources in canada during the winter seasons utilities would like to know whether their gac contactors that were designed to operate in the summer will continue to provide effective treatment at water temperatures near freezing surprisingly there is almost no information in the literature about the impact of temperature 0 20 c on gac performance under these types of operational conditions as an example the u s environmental protection agency s information collection rule in 1996 required many utilities to conduct rapid small scale column tests rsscts to assess gac performance for various treatment objectives but temperature control was not required with the result that most tests were conducted at the room temperature u s epa 1996 a review of much of the research literature related to gac performance for micropollutant removal also shows that almost all work was done at the room temperature e g corwin and summers 2012 summers et al 2013 greenwald et al 2015 gac performance in fixed bed adsorbers is affected by adsorption thermodynamics adsorption kinetics and biodegradation with each showing distinct and sometimes opposite trends with temperature starting with thermodynamics a negative change in gibbs free energy negative Î´ g has typically been reported for adsorption saha and chowdhury 2011 in a single solute adsorption system physical adsorption of an adsorbate by gac is a condensation process which is accompanied by a decrease in entropy negative Î´ s thomas 1961 thus according to the gibbs equation eq 1 Î´ h must be negative indicating that physical adsorption is thermodynamically exothermic it is therefore expected that adsorption decreases with increasing temperature 1 Î´ g Î´ h t Î´ s where Î´ g is the change of gibbs free energy during the process j Î´ h is the change of enthalpy j t is temperature k and Î´ s is the change of entropy j k the negative temperature effect on single solute adsorption has been confirmed in many studies adsorption at equilibrium was lower in warmer water for phenolic compounds ma et al 1996 fluroxypyr pastrana martÃ­nez et al 2009 as well as for phenol and o cresol in anoxic systems nakhla et al 1994 however in other studies warmer water led to an increase in adsorption at equilibrium for natural organic matter nom summers and roberts 1988 schreiber et al 2005 2007 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid aksu and kabasakal 2004 sulfamethazine nam et al 2014 and for phenol and o cresol in oxic systems nakhla et al 1994 this phenomenon was considered to be attributed to chemical as opposed to physical adsorption fontecha cÃ¡mara et al 2006 marczewski et al 2016 moreover the temperature effect on adsorption has been found to be more complicated in multi solute adsorption systems in which competitive adsorption takes place for example li et al 2014 observed that the adsorption capacity for atrazine decreased in warmer tap water but schreiber et al 2007 found that the adsorption capacity for atrazine increased in warmer water containing significant nom in summary while physical adsorption in a single solute system may be exothermic the effect of temperature on net equilibrium adsorption physical and chemical in a multicomponent system is variable in terms of adsorption kinetics the adsorption of a single solute is enhanced with temperature according to the arrhenius equation eq 2 zhdanov 1991 several studies have investigated the effect of water temperature on adsorption kinetics and confirmed that adsorption rate increases with temperature valenzuela calahorro et al 2004 azizian and yahyaei 2006 dudamel et al 2010 podkoÅcielny and nieszporek 2011 marczewski et al 2016 2 k a d a exp e a r t where k a d is the adsorption rate

full scale systems where all factors affecting treatment are considered together the objective of this study was therefore to investigate the effect of water temperature on the overall performance of gac under realistic operating conditions when treating mib and geosmin batch isotherm experiments were first conducted at 4 c 10 c and 20 c using gac harvested from drinking water treatment plants to determine freundlich isotherm parameters then pilot scale column tests were performed at the same temperatures to evaluate the temperature effect on the overall removal including both adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics as well as potential biodegradation the determined freundlich isotherm parameters were then inputted into a pore and surface diffusion model psdm to fit the experimental data of the pilot scale column tests which allowed the kinetic parameters to be determined at the different temperatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 gac samples three samples of preloaded coal based gac filtrasorb 300 were harvested from two drinking water treatment plants in ontario canada including 6 year old plant a gac 1 year old plant b gac and 6 year old plant b gac core samples across the depth of the gac were collected using a filter judge usabluebook and they were stored wet at 4 c for a maximum of two weeks prior to use the gac properties are listed in table 1 2 2 isotherm test to understand the effect of water temperature on the adsorption thermodynamics of mib and geosmin batch isotherm tests were conducted at 4 c 10 c and 20 c using 250 ml amber bottles the water samples used for the isotherm test included i samples collected from the drinking treatment plant at a point immediately prior to the gac contactor ii dechlorinated toronto tap water and iii ultrapure water the water characteristics are listed in the supplementary material table s1 each bottle was dosed with a different amount of the preloaded gac ranging from 16 to 128 mg harvested from plant a the uncrushed air dried gac of 10 12 mesh size 1 7 2 0 mm was used since this size fraction is the largest size fraction in the gac by mass based on sieve analysis an additional control bottle without gac was used to confirm that there was no system loss during the test the bottles were filled headspace free with water spiked with 300 mg l sodium azide to suppress microbial activity lichstein and soule 1944 previous work suggests that this level of sodium azide would not interfere with the adsorption process in batch reactors rattier et al 2012 mib and geosmin were added together to the water to an approximate initial concentration of 400 ng l for each compound using a 2 mg l mib geosmin milli q standard solution made from dry mib and geosmin chemical reagents sigma aldrich canada graham et al 2000 confirmed that there was insignificant competitive adsorption between geosmin and mib when they are at very low concentrations e g ng l then all the bottles were tightly sealed with teflon lined caps and tumbled for 35 days which was the time needed to sufficiently reach an accurate isotherm value according to preliminary tests run at 4 c to 96 days as shown in the supplementary information at the end of the adsorption period the water in each bottle was filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m membrane prior to analysis for aqueous phase mib or geosmin concentration 2 3 column test pilot scale column tests were conducted at 4 c 10 c and 20 c to evaluate the overall temperature effect on the adsorption including both thermodynamics and kinetics and potential biodegradation the pilot scale column test used only dechlorinated toronto tap water the pilot columns were made of glass with an internal diameter of 2 54 cm and a length of 125 cm the ratio of column diameter to particle diameter was 15 based on the mean particle size of the gac samples previous studies reported that a ratio as small as 6 5 can sufficiently eliminate wall effects on mass transfer gillogly 1999 knappe et al 1999 nie et al 2020 the gac core samples 1 year old plant a gac and 1 and 6 year old plant b gac were collected from the full scale filters and divided into five segments according to the full scale bed depth and then they were packed into the columns with the same stratification of the full scale beds duplicate columns were installed at each temperature the feedwater was spiked with a concentration of approximately 100 ng l of mib and geosmin using the same mib geosmin standard solution for the isotherm tests and it was pumped through the columns with an empty bed contact time ebct of 4 min the test was run for 300 bed volumes 20 h due to practical constraints the test was operated in an intermittent mode with flow only during normal working hours in theory stopping the flow overnight may cause desorption of mib geosmin however previous research has shown that the difference between the test results during intermittent versus continuous 24 h operation of such pilot scale column tests is insignificant due to the very low rate of desorption huang et al 2019 flow rate and water temperature were monitored regularly to ensure constant conditions headspace free water samples were collected periodically using amber vials to determine the mib geosmin concentrations in the influent and effluent which enabled calculation of the breakthrough fraction s s 0 each vial was spiked with 180 mg l sodium azide to preserve the sample which was stored in the dark at 4 c prior to analysis 2 4 analytical methods mib and geosmin were pre concentrated using a solid phase micro extraction syringe fiber sigma aldrich canada and analyzed on a varian 3800 gas chromatograph coupled with a varian 4200 mass spectrometer the analysis was based on standard method 6040d apha awwa wef 2012 kaloudis et al 2016 geosmin d3 was used as an internal standard the method has a detection limit of 2 4 ng l for mib and 1 8 ng l for geosmin 2 5 mathematical model and parameterization the research aimed to quantify the effect of water temperature on the adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics for mib and geosmin both empirically and mechanistically the mechanistic approach was based on the psdm the psdm describes adsorption through three processes liquid phase transport intraparticle diffusion pore and surface diffusion and adsorption onto the carbon surface which can be expressed by eqs 4 6 respectively the axial dispersion was neglected here since its contribution was quite small compared to advection and adsorption sontheimer et al 1988 a detailed description of the psdm can be found in friedman 1984 and crittenden et al 1986 4 s i z t t v s i z t z 3 1 Ïµ Ïµ r a k f i s i z t s p i r r a z t 5 t q i r z t Ïµ a Ï a s p i r z t 1 r 2 r r 2 d p i Ïµ a Ï a s p

the research was therefore aimed at estimating the impact of temperature on these five parameters and to identify if possible which one s tends to govern any observed temperature effects under the conditions evaluated biodegradation is considered later the values of input parameters for the model simulation are shown in table 2 it is important to note that the tortuosity value was calculated based on the 6 year old gac and the equivalent background compound ebc molar volume was arbitrarily set to be 1000 cm3 mol in order to calculate the diffusivity of ebc the effect of temperature on the two freundlich isotherm parameters was measured using the previously described isotherm tests performed at three different temperatures to solve eq 7 for 1 n and k for mib geosmin in ultrapure water 7 q e k s e 1 n where q e is the equivalent solid phase loading and s e is the equivalent liquid phase concentration then the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast ebc approach coupled with the multi component freundlich isotherm eq 6 was used to determine the 1 n and k values for the background organics that compete with mib geosmin for the adsorption sites based on the experimental data of the isotherm test with dechlorinated toronto tap water at three temperatures a detailed description of the iast ebc approach is given in the supplementary material the impact of temperature on the pore

five temperature dependent parameters in the psdm is the film diffusion coefficient k f the value of k f for a specific adsorbate on virgin gac can be estimated from the gnielinski correlation gnielinski 1978 however this equation does not consider the impact of nom fouling and cannot be used for calculating k f on preloaded gac nie et al 2020 in addition biological growth on carbon is expected and this biofilm would likely decrease k f yu et al 2009 thus to obtain a more accurate k f value on the preloaded gac and to determine its temperature dependence the mib and geosmin breakthrough results from the pilot scale column tests were fit to the psdm using values for the other four temperature dependent parameters as previously explained this therefore allowed the value of k f at each temperature to be back calculated the detailed procedure is described in the supplementary material note that this method for back calculating k f using the psdm coupled with the pilot scale data means that any biodegradation of mib and geosmin that may be occurring would be expressed within this kinetic term therefore a new kinetic term the overall external mass transfer coefficient k f was introduced this term reflects the effect of the two kinetic factors that may control the rate of removal of mib and geosmin from the water film diffusion and biodegradation that being said the atp that was measured on the harvested gac was in the order of 100 ng g table 1 which although not definitive implies a relatively low level of biological activity pharand et al 2014 it may therefore be reasonable to conclude that k f reflects mainly film diffusion in this study but this assumption is not essential to the interpretation of our results further research is needed to establish a more accurate quantitative estimate of the relative contribution of film diffusion i e adsorption and biodegradation a relationship between the overall external mass transfer coefficient k f and the water temperature was then derived by searching a function library datafit 9 oakdale engineering which contains more than 600 pre defined functions that are typically used in scientific and engineering applications a best fit function correlating water temperature to k f was determined subsequently this best fit function could be incorporated into the psdm to predict the effluent concentrations of the gac pilot scale column at different temperatures to assess the effect of variation in temperature dependent model parameters due to temperature change on the model output the sensitivity analysis was performed by varying one parameter s values across the range of 4 20 c while keeping the others constant at their values for 20 c assuming that the investigated model parameters are independent of ebct the analysis was conducted with two ebcts i e 4 min and 15 min to see how the breakthrough value changes when varying k f d p k and 1 n under high and low flow rates respectively 2 6 statistical methods the values of freundlich isotherm parameters 1 n and k and overall external mass transfer coefficients k f were estimated by minimizing the sum of squared deviations between the experimental data and the nonlinear model outputs however several sources of uncertainty such as systematic biases or measurement error may contribute to the biased estimation of the parameters vugrin et al 2005 for this reason 95 joint confidence regions jcrs for the two parameters i e 1 n and k were determined to allow the potential temperature effects to be identified with statistical confidence traditional linear methods to determine the jcr might be misleading because the freundlich isotherm model is nonlinear and its linearized model residuals may not be normally distributed to solve this problem the f test method eq 13 bates and watts 1988 was used to determine the jcr for the parameters the jcr was plotted using matlab r2018b mathworks see the supplementary material and it is based on the assumption that the error terms are jointly normally distributed or spherically normal to verify the normality q q quantile quantile plots were conducted

temperature did not significantly affect the equilibrium adsorption capacity for mib for geosmin however it was found that the adsorption behaviour at 10 c and 20 c was similar but adsorption decreased at 4 c a similar phenomenon has been reported in other studies for different adsorbates aksu and kabasakal 2004 fontecha cÃ¡mara et al 2006 where decreased adsorption at equilibrium was observed at lower temperatures this suggests that the adsorption of geosmin on preloaded gac is an endothermic process contrary to normal expectations that adsorption is typically exothermic a possible explanation is that chemisorption might play a more important role than physical adsorption for the adsorption of geosmin by preloaded gac different from physical adsorption which is purely a surface condensation chemisorption involves surface reaction thomas 1961 an increase in temperature may result in more rupture and creation of chemical bonds creating some new adsorption sites on the carbon surface aksu and kabasakal 2004 thus increasing adsorption in addition given its planar molecular structure the geosmin molecule could have an increased planarity at higher temperature which enables it to have more access to the micropores of the adsorbents fontecha cÃ¡mara et al 2006 this may explain why the adsorption of geosmin was more affected by water temperature than mib which has a three dimensional chemical structure note that in most cases the 1 n values in this study were greater than 1 which is different from the reported 1 n values 1 in previous studies that conducted isotherm tests for mib and geosmin chen et al 1997 graham et al 2000 a potential reason for this discrepancy is that this study used preloaded gac i e 6 year old gac for the isotherm test but the previous studies used either virgin gac or pac in preloaded gac nom fouling may render the adsorption of geosmin and mib less favorable thus resulting in a 1 n value greater than 1 in most cases tran et al 2017 there is a high correlation between 1 n and k in the freundlich equation hence it is preferable to define a jcr of these two parameters as a function of temperature rather than individual confidence ranges in fig 2 a the overlapped jcrs for mib adsorption isotherm parameters at the three temperatures indicates that there was no statistically significant effect of temperature for geosmin fig 2b however it was observed that the jcr at 4 c was significantly different from those at 10 c and 20 c it should be noted that the jcrs were set at the 95 confidence level which requires a large difference in solid phase loadings at different temperatures to yield a statistically significant effect e g the geosmin loading at 10 c would need to be at least three times that at 4 c to be significantly different the isotherm tests were then repeated in water containing nom fig 3i and 3ii including gac contactor influent from plant a and dechlorinated toronto tap water the effect of water temperature on geosmin adsorption was found to vary in different water matrices geosmin adsorption in water from plant a did not increase significantly with increasing water temperature fig 3ib however its adsorption in dechlorinated toronto tap water was greatly enhanced when water temperature increased from 4 c to 10 20 c and the temperature effect was more pronounced at low liquid phase concentration 30 ng l fig 3iib fig 3ib and 3iib show that solid phase loadings of geosmin in dechlorinated toronto tap water were much lower than that in water from plant a indicating a stronger competitive adsorption between geosmin and background organic matter bom in dechlorinated toronto tap water the potential reason for this phenomenon is that with the addition of an oxidant like chlorine large humics in natural water might be broken down into smaller organics resulting in a greater amount of low molecular weight aromatic organics in tap water which has been considered to be the key nom fraction that competes with geosmin wang et al 2020 thus it can be concluded that temperature had a greater impact on geosmin adsorption when the competitive adsorption between geosmin and bom was strong a similar observation was reported by schreiber et al 2007 who discovered that the effect of temperature on atrazine adsorption was more distinct in cases with strong competitive adsorption as shown in fig 4 i the overlapped jcrs for mib geosmin adsorption isotherm parameters in gac contactor influent from plant a at three temperatures indicates that there was no statistically significant difference among the fitted freundlich parameter values for the mib geosmin adsorption in dechlorinated toronto tap water fig 4ii however it was found that the jcr at 4 c was significantly different from that at 20 c at the 95 confidence level 3 2 effect of temperature on overall removal breakthrough across the pilot scale gac columns for mib and geosmin at the three different temperatures over 300 bed volumes of treated water 20 h using gac from plant a and dechlorinated toronto tap water is shown in fig 5 the breakthrough curves were plotted over only 300 bed volumes to evaluate the pseudo steady state breakthrough values which represent the current performance of the preloaded gac at different temperatures it has been reported that column tests reach pseudo steady state within this time frame gillogly 1999 huang et al 2019 at low temperatures 4 c and 10 c the breakthrough of mib was approximately 70 but it decreased to 50 when the water temperature was 20 c a similar phenomenon was observed for geosmin breakthrough at different temperatures the breakthrough of geosmin in cold water was greater than that in warm water overall geosmin breakthrough was approximately 30 lower than mib breakthrough which is consistent with full scale experience fig 6 shows the results of the pilot scale column tests using gac of two different ages 1 year old and 6 years old harvested from plant b with dechlorinated toronto tap water the water temperature had a similar effect on the breakthrough of mib and geosmin as was observed on gac from plant a the breakthrough decreased by around 20 as water became warmer from 4 10 c to 20 c as expected the 1 year old gac showed better performance than the 6 year old gac with around 25 and 30 more mib and geosmin removed respectively based on the results it can be summarized that mib geosmin breakthrough was similar at 4 c and 10 c but that removal improved by about 20 30 at 20 c for the three types of gac the pilot scale column test therefore showed a different temperature effect on mib geosmin adsorption compared to the isotherm test which indicated that mib adsorption was comparable at the three temperatures and that geosmin adsorption was similar at 10 c and 20 c but decreased at 4 c the pilot scale column test results depend on both adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics and potential biodegradation whereas the isotherm reflects only adsorption thermodynamics hence it is reasonable to conclude that water temperature had more impact on the adsorption kinetics and potential biodegradation of mib and geosmin than on the adsorption thermodynamics under the conditions tested with more mib and geosmin adsorbed at higher temperatures 3 3 effect of temperature on model prediction 3 3 1 temperature dependent model parameters there are five parameters in the psdm that are temperature dependent two are freundlich isotherm parameters k and 1 n whose temperature dependence was measured experimentally using isotherm tests on ultrapure water two more temperature dependent model parameters are the pore diffusion coefficient d p and surface diffusion coefficients d s whose temperature dependences can be calculated directly using equations eq 8 and eq 12 the values of d p and d s can also be determined using the psdm to fit the batch kinetic test data however in this study the batch kinetic test was conducted at 4 c which would enable the d p and d s values to be determined for that temperature only instead the d p and d s values calculated using the empirical equations were similar to the values errors 5 determined by fitting the model the model fitting results are shown in fig s1 thus using empirical equations instead of batch kinetic results to calculate values for d p and d s is a valid approach the final temperature dependent parameter was overall external mass transfer coefficient k f which describes a combination of film diffusion and potential biodegradation and it was solved by using the pilot scale data along with the psdm to obtain best fit values for k f at each temperature the resulting psdm model output is shown in fig 5 the values of the temperature dependent model parameters are shown in table 3 there is no apparent trend for the estimated k and 1 n values at different temperatures for diffusion coefficients the d p value increased as the water temperature increased but the d s value was approximately 30 orders of magnitude lower than that of d p this is because surface diffusion was not significant with background nom present thus the temperature effect on d s does not appear to meaningfully influence gac performance for both mib and gesomin the fitted k f value did not change significantly when the water temperature increased from 4 c to 10 c however as the temperature increased to 20 c k f doubled 3 3 2 sensitivity analysis of temperature dependent model parameters as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 an analysis was performed to assess the sensitivity of the model output to each temperature dependent model parameter for both mib and geosmin the variations in k f due to temperature change had the greatest impact on the simulated breakthrough value with both ebcts by changing k f from its value at 20 c to its values at 4 c and 10 c breakthrough increased by about 20 changes to d p k and 1 n had no observable impact and as explained previously the overall effect of d s is negligible this is similar to work reported by gillogly 1999 and nie et al 2020 who analyzed the sensitivity of simulated mib breakthrough to psdm model parameters at a fixed temperature by increasing or decreasing parameter values over several orders of magnitude and they also found that film diffusion had the greatest impact on mib breakthrough it is therefore reasonable to theorize that the adsorption of mib and geosmin under the conditions evaluated is a film diffusion controlled process and that the variations in their adsorption caused by temperature change is mainly due to the temperature effect on film diffusion in contrast other studies using trichloroethylene carter and weber 1994 and atrazine knappe et al 1999 reported that intraparticle diffusion d p d s had the greatest impact on breakthrough this may be due to different adsorption characteristics of the target compounds geosmin and mib have been found not to penetrate the adsorbent but instead preferentially adsorb near the external surface of activated carbon matsui et al 2014 so film diffusion instead of pore diffusion may be the rate limiting adsorption step for mib or geosmin 3 3 3 model prediction based on the results of the sensitivity analysis section 3 3 2 it was found that only one temperature dependent model parameter k f had a significant effect on the simulated breakthrough thus it would be relatively straightforward to modify the psdm to include temperature effects by expressing k f as a mathematical function of temperature such a function that fit the data well r2 0 75 0 83 is given in eq 15 and shown in fig 9 the model implies an initial slow and later rapid increase for k f with temperature interestingly this function is in the same form as the arrhenius equation eq 2 this exponential model is also a good fit for the k f values at different temperatures for atrazine and imidacloprid adsorption by virgin gac reported by dudamel et al 2010 which is the only other dataset that could be identified in the literature on this subject however the proposed function is based on only three data points and more data should be collected in future work to properly calibrate and validate the model 15 k f a exp b t where a and b are the fitted constants a represents the fouling index which decreases as the fouling film becomes thicker b quantifies the rate of exponential increase which may depend on the sensitivity of specific compound adsorption to temperature 4 summary and conclusions the effect of water temperature on the adsorption thermodynamics adsorption kinetics and potential biodegradation for mib and geosmin was studied using isotherm tests and pilot scale column tests at three temperatures the isotherm tests indicated that water temperature did not significantly affect the adsorption thermodynamics of mib while there was a moderate impact on geosmin whereby the equilibrium adsorption capacity was lower at 4 c compared to 10 c and 20 c the temperature had a greater impact on geosmin adsorption when there was competitive adsorption between geosmin and nom for the pilot scale column test it was found that mib geosmin breakthrough was similar at 4 c and 10 c but it increased by 20 30 at 20 c it was therefore concluded that water temperature had more impact on the adsorption kinetics and or potential biodegradation of mib and geosmin than on the adsorption thermodynamics under the conditions tested to learn more about the mechanism of the temperature effect the psdm was applied to data from the isotherm tests and pilot scale column tests the values of five temperature dependent parameters in the model 1 n k k f d p and d s were determined at three temperatures a sensitivity analysis revealed that the simulated mib and geosmin breakthrough values were most sensitive to variations in k f caused by temperature change with 15 20 breakthrough increase when temperature decreased from 20 c to 4 10 c an exponential model that uses temperature to calculate k f was proposed which enables the prediction of removals of mib and geosmin by gac at different temperatures perhaps the most immediate benefit of this research is that it demonstrates that the removal of geosmin and mib in fixed bed gac adsorbers is affected by temperature while this may seem intuitively obvious there was a surprising lack of information on this topic in the literature under the conditions of this study removal of the compounds was approximately 20 30 better at temperatures representative of the summer 20 c compared to the winter 4 c utilities often face lower water demands in the winter so the inferior gac performance in controlling a taste and odour event in the winter might be able to be overcome by bringing more gac contactors into service thereby reducing the flow rate in each individual bed to allow for more contact time declaration of competing

17748,granular activated carbon gac is widely used by drinking water treatment plants in the great lakes region to control 2 methylisoborneol mib and geosmin associated with summertime algal blooms recently however taste and odour events are being detected in the winter but there is limited information in the literature about the effect of temperature on gac performance in this study batch isotherm experiments were conducted at 4 c 10 c and 20 c to evaluate the temperature impact on adsorption thermodynamics pilot scale column tests were then performed at the same temperatures to evaluate the temperature effect on overall removal including both thermodynamics and kinetics the pore and surface diffusion model psdm was applied to fit the experimental data of the pilot scale column tests which allowed the kinetic parameters to be determined at each temperature the isotherm results showed that water temperature did not have a significant effect on the equilibrium adsorption capacity i e the thermodynamics for mib and geosmin under the conditions tested but the pilot tests showed an increased removal of mib and geosmin by 20 30 at 20 c compared to the lower temperatures this demonstrates that water temperature has more impact on kinetics than thermodynamics numerical simulations showed that the overall external mass transfer coefficient k f had the greatest impact on breakthrough an exponential equation was proposed to correlate temperature and k f and it could be incorporated into a site specific psdm to predict the removals of mib and geosmin in gac contactors at different temperatures the model could then be used by a utility for example to predict the required increase in empty bed contact time needed to control taste and odour in the winter to the same extent as in the summer graphical abstract image 1 keywords 2 methylisoborneol geosmin granular activated carbon adsorption temperature 1 introduction in the great lakes region granular activated carbon gac contactors are widely used by drinking water treatment plants to control 2 methylisoborneol mib and geosmin these taste and odour causing compounds have historically been associated with algal blooms that occur in the summer or early fall when water temperatures are at their highest around 20 c in recent years however there are increasing reports of taste and odour events in the winter possibly due to climate change that is leading to fewer days of ice cover in the winter and more frequent winter storms for example parinet et al 2010 reported concentrations of up to 15 ng l mib in three drinking water sources in canada during the winter seasons utilities would like to know whether their gac contactors that were designed to operate in the summer will continue to provide effective treatment at water temperatures near freezing surprisingly there is almost no information in the literature about the impact of temperature 0 20 c on gac performance under these types of operational conditions as an example the u s environmental protection agency s information collection rule in 1996 required many utilities to conduct rapid small scale column tests rsscts to assess gac performance for various treatment objectives but temperature control was not required with the result that most tests were conducted at the room temperature u s epa 1996 a review of much of the research literature related to gac performance for micropollutant removal also shows that almost all work was done at the room temperature e g corwin and summers 2012 summers et al 2013 greenwald et al 2015 gac performance in fixed bed adsorbers is affected by adsorption thermodynamics adsorption kinetics and biodegradation with each showing distinct and sometimes opposite trends with temperature starting with thermodynamics a negative change in gibbs free energy negative Î´ g has typically been reported for adsorption saha and chowdhury 2011 in a single solute adsorption system physical adsorption of an adsorbate by gac is a condensation process which is accompanied by a decrease in entropy negative Î´ s thomas 1961 thus according to the gibbs equation eq 1 Î´ h must be negative indicating that physical adsorption is thermodynamically exothermic it is therefore expected that adsorption decreases with increasing temperature 1 Î´ g Î´ h t Î´ s where Î´ g is the change of gibbs free energy during the process j Î´ h is the change of enthalpy j t is temperature k and Î´ s is the change of entropy j k the negative temperature effect on single solute adsorption has been confirmed in many studies adsorption at equilibrium was lower in warmer water for phenolic compounds ma et al 1996 fluroxypyr pastrana martÃ­nez et al 2009 as well as for phenol and o cresol in anoxic systems nakhla et al 1994 however in other studies warmer water led to an increase in adsorption at equilibrium for natural organic matter nom summers and roberts 1988 schreiber et al 2005 2007 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid aksu and kabasakal 2004 sulfamethazine nam et al 2014 and for phenol and o cresol in oxic systems nakhla et al 1994 this phenomenon was considered to be attributed to chemical as opposed to physical adsorption fontecha cÃ¡mara et al 2006 marczewski et al 2016 moreover the temperature effect on adsorption has been found to be more complicated in multi solute adsorption systems in which competitive adsorption takes place for example li et al 2014 observed that the adsorption capacity for atrazine decreased in warmer tap water but schreiber et al 2007 found that the adsorption capacity for atrazine increased in warmer water containing significant nom in summary while physical adsorption in a single solute system may be exothermic the effect of temperature on net equilibrium adsorption physical and chemical in a multicomponent system is variable in terms of adsorption kinetics the adsorption of a single solute is enhanced with temperature according to the arrhenius equation eq 2 zhdanov 1991 several studies have investigated the effect of water temperature on adsorption kinetics and confirmed that adsorption rate increases with

full scale systems where all factors affecting treatment are considered together the objective of this study was therefore to investigate the effect of water temperature on the overall performance of gac under realistic operating conditions when treating mib and geosmin batch isotherm experiments were first conducted at 4 c 10 c and 20 c using gac harvested from drinking water treatment plants to determine freundlich isotherm parameters then pilot scale column tests were performed at the same temperatures to evaluate the temperature effect on the overall removal including both adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics as well as potential biodegradation the determined freundlich isotherm parameters were then inputted into a pore and surface diffusion model psdm to fit the experimental data of the pilot scale column tests which allowed the kinetic parameters to be determined at the different temperatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 gac samples three samples of preloaded coal based gac filtrasorb 300 were harvested from two drinking water treatment plants in ontario canada including 6 year old plant a gac 1 year old plant b gac and 6 year old plant b gac core samples across the depth of the gac were collected using a filter judge usabluebook and they were stored wet at 4 c for a maximum of two weeks prior to use the gac properties are listed in table 1 2 2 isotherm test to understand the effect of water temperature on the adsorption thermodynamics of mib and geosmin batch isotherm tests were conducted at 4 c 10 c and 20 c using 250 ml amber bottles the water samples used for the isotherm test included i samples collected from the drinking treatment plant at a point immediately prior to the gac contactor ii dechlorinated toronto tap water and iii ultrapure water the water characteristics are listed in the supplementary material table s1 each bottle was dosed with a different amount of the preloaded gac ranging from 16 to 128 mg harvested from plant a the uncrushed air dried gac of 10 12 mesh size 1 7 2 0 mm was used since this size fraction is the largest size fraction in the gac by mass based on sieve analysis an additional control bottle without gac was used to confirm that there was no system loss during the test the bottles were filled headspace free with water spiked with 300 mg l sodium azide to suppress microbial activity lichstein and soule 1944 previous work suggests that this level of sodium azide would not interfere with the adsorption process in batch reactors rattier et al 2012 mib and geosmin were added together to the water to an approximate initial concentration of 400 ng l for each compound using a 2 mg l mib geosmin milli q standard solution made from dry mib and geosmin chemical reagents sigma aldrich canada graham et al 2000 confirmed that there was insignificant competitive adsorption between geosmin and mib when they are at very low concentrations e g ng l then all the bottles were tightly sealed with teflon lined caps and tumbled for 35 days which was the time needed to sufficiently reach an accurate isotherm value according to preliminary tests run at 4 c to 96 days as shown in the supplementary information at the end of the adsorption period the water in each bottle was filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m membrane prior to analysis for aqueous phase mib or geosmin concentration 2 3 column test pilot scale column tests were conducted at 4 c 10 c and 20 c to evaluate the overall temperature effect on the adsorption including both thermodynamics and kinetics and potential biodegradation the pilot scale column test used only dechlorinated toronto tap water the pilot columns were made of glass with an internal diameter of 2 54 cm and a length of 125 cm the ratio of column diameter to particle diameter was 15 based on the mean particle size of the gac samples previous studies reported that a ratio as small as 6 5 can sufficiently eliminate wall effects on mass transfer gillogly 1999 knappe et al 1999 nie et al 2020 the gac core samples 1 year old plant a gac and 1 and 6 year old plant b gac were collected from the full scale filters and divided into five segments according to the full scale bed depth and then they were packed into the columns with the same stratification of the full scale beds duplicate columns were installed at each temperature the feedwater was spiked with a concentration of approximately 100 ng l of mib and geosmin using the same mib geosmin standard solution for the isotherm tests and it was pumped through the columns with an empty bed contact time ebct of 4 min the test was run for 300 bed volumes 20 h due to practical constraints the test was operated in an intermittent mode with flow only during normal working hours in theory stopping the flow overnight may cause desorption of mib geosmin however previous research has shown that the difference between the test results during intermittent versus continuous 24 h operation of such pilot scale column tests is insignificant due to the very low rate of desorption huang et al 2019 flow rate and water temperature were monitored regularly to ensure constant conditions headspace free water samples were collected periodically using amber vials to determine the mib geosmin concentrations in the influent and effluent which enabled calculation of the breakthrough fraction s s 0 each vial was spiked with 180 mg l sodium azide to preserve the sample which was stored in the dark at 4 c prior to analysis 2 4 analytical methods mib and geosmin were pre concentrated using a solid phase micro extraction syringe fiber sigma aldrich canada and analyzed on a varian 3800 gas chromatograph coupled with a varian 4200 mass spectrometer the analysis was based on standard method 6040d apha awwa wef 2012 kaloudis et al 2016 geosmin d3 was used as an internal standard the method has a detection limit of 2 4 ng l for mib and 1 8 ng l for geosmin 2 5 mathematical model and parameterization the research aimed to quantify the effect of water temperature on the adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics for mib and geosmin both empirically and mechanistically the mechanistic approach was based on the psdm the psdm describes adsorption through three processes liquid phase transport intraparticle diffusion pore and surface diffusion and adsorption onto the carbon surface which can be expressed by eqs 4 6 respectively the axial dispersion was neglected here since its contribution was quite small compared to advection and adsorption sontheimer et al 1988 a detailed description of the psdm can be found in friedman 1984 and crittenden et al 1986 4 s i z t t v s i z t z 3 1 Ïµ Ïµ r a k f i s i z t s p i r r a z t 5 t q i r z t Ïµ a Ï a s p i r z t 1 r 2 r r 2 d p i Ïµ a Ï a s p

the research was therefore aimed at estimating the impact of temperature on these five parameters and to identify if possible which one s tends to govern any observed temperature effects under the conditions evaluated biodegradation is considered later the values of input parameters for the model simulation are shown in table 2 it is important to note that the tortuosity value was calculated based on the 6 year old gac and the equivalent background compound ebc molar volume was arbitrarily set to be 1000 cm3 mol in order to calculate the diffusivity of ebc the effect of temperature on the two freundlich isotherm parameters was measured using the previously described isotherm tests performed at three different temperatures to solve eq 7 for 1 n and k for mib geosmin in ultrapure water 7

isotherm test with dechlorinated toronto tap water at three temperatures a detailed description of the iast ebc approach is given in the supplementary material the impact of temperature on the pore diffusion coefficient d p cm2 s was calculated theoretically by using eq 8 sontheimer et al 1988 8 d p d l Ï p where d l is the liquid diffusivity cm2 s which can be estimated by the hayduk and laudie correlation eq 9 hayduk and laudie 1974 and Ï p is the adsorbent tortuosity dimensionless which can be calculated based on eq 10 sontheimer et al 1988 9 d l 13 26 10 5 Î¼ l 1 14 v b 0 589 10 Ï p 0 334 6 61 10 6 t s where Î¼ l is the water viscosity cp v b is the molar volume of the adsorbate at its normal boiling point cm3 mol and t s is the service time min in this study values of Ï p 3 and 20 were selected representing approximately 1 and 6 year old gac respectively the water viscosity Î¼ l varies at different temperatures eq 11 reid et al 1987 so d p at different temperatures can be determined accordingly 11 Î¼ l e 24 71 4209 t 0 04527 t 3 376 10 5 t 2 the effect of temperature on the surface diffusion coefficient d s cm2 s was also estimated from theory by using the following equation sontheimer et al 1988 12 d s d l Ïµ a s 0 Ï p Ï a q 0 s p d f r where s 0 is the influent concentration of the adsorbate mg l q 0 is the solid phase loading in equilibrium with s 0 mg g and s p d f r is the surface to pore diffusion flux ratio dimensionless it has been reported that surface diffusion can be neglected when significant background nom is present jarvie et al 2005 this scenario applies to our study since nom containing water and nom preloaded gac were used in the experiment for simplification s p d f r was set to near zero 10 30 to effectively remove the surface diffusion term from the model equations the value of d s at each temperature was determined based on its relationship eq 12 with d l which varies with temperature eqs 9 11 the final parameter of the five temperature dependent parameters in the psdm is the film diffusion coefficient k f the value of k f for a specific adsorbate on virgin gac can be estimated from the gnielinski correlation gnielinski 1978 however this equation does not consider the impact of nom fouling and cannot be used for calculating k f on preloaded gac nie et al 2020 in addition biological growth on carbon is expected and this biofilm would likely decrease k f yu et al 2009 thus to obtain a more accurate k f value on the preloaded gac and to determine its temperature dependence the mib and geosmin breakthrough results from the pilot scale column tests were fit to the psdm using values for the other four temperature dependent parameters as previously explained this therefore allowed the value of k f at each temperature to be back calculated the detailed procedure is described in the supplementary material note that this method for back calculating k f using the psdm coupled with the pilot scale data means that any biodegradation of mib and geosmin that may be occurring would be expressed within this kinetic term therefore a new kinetic term the overall external mass transfer coefficient k f was introduced this term reflects the effect of the two kinetic factors that may control the rate of removal of mib and geosmin from the water film diffusion and biodegradation that being said the atp that was measured on the harvested gac was in the order of 100 ng g table 1 which although not definitive implies a relatively low level of biological activity pharand et al 2014 it may therefore be reasonable to conclude that k f reflects mainly film diffusion in this study but this assumption is not essential to the interpretation of our results further research is needed to establish a more accurate quantitative estimate of the relative contribution of film diffusion i e adsorption and biodegradation a relationship between the overall external mass transfer coefficient k f and the water temperature was then derived by searching a function library datafit 9 oakdale engineering which contains more than 600 pre defined functions that are typically used in scientific and engineering applications a best fit function correlating water temperature to k f was determined subsequently this best fit function could be incorporated into the psdm to predict the effluent concentrations of the gac pilot scale column at different temperatures to assess the effect of variation in temperature dependent model parameters due to temperature change on the model output the sensitivity analysis was performed by varying one parameter s values across the range of 4 20 c while keeping the others constant at their values for 20 c assuming that the investigated model parameters are independent of ebct the analysis was conducted with two ebcts i e 4 min and 15 min to see how the breakthrough value changes when varying k f d p k and 1 n under high and low flow rates respectively 2 6 statistical methods the values of freundlich isotherm parameters 1 n and k and overall external mass transfer coefficients k f were estimated by minimizing the sum of squared deviations between the experimental data and the nonlinear model outputs however several sources of uncertainty such as systematic biases or measurement error may contribute to the biased estimation of the parameters vugrin et al 2005 for this reason 95 joint confidence regions jcrs for the two parameters i e 1 n and k were determined to allow the potential temperature effects to be identified with statistical confidence traditional linear methods to determine the jcr might be misleading because the freundlich isotherm model is nonlinear and its linearized model residuals may not be normally distributed to solve this problem the f test method eq 13 bates and watts 1988 was used to determine the jcr for the parameters the jcr was plotted using matlab r2018b mathworks see the supplementary material and it is based on the assumption that the error terms are jointly normally distributed or spherically normal to verify the normality q q quantile quantile plots were conducted the detailed procedure is shown in the supplementary material 13 s Î¸ s Î¸ Ë s Î¸ Ë p n p f p n p Î± where s Î¸ is the residual sum of squares for the parameter vector Î¸ s Î¸ Ë is the residual sum

standard deviation of the parameter 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of temperature on adsorption thermodynamics the results of the isotherm tests in ultrapure water are shown in fig 1 the water temperature did not significantly affect the equilibrium adsorption capacity for mib for geosmin however it was found that the adsorption behaviour at 10 c and 20 c was similar but adsorption decreased at 4 c a similar phenomenon has been reported in other studies for different adsorbates aksu and kabasakal 2004 fontecha cÃ¡mara et al 2006 where decreased adsorption at equilibrium was observed at lower temperatures this suggests that the adsorption of geosmin on preloaded gac is an endothermic process contrary to normal expectations that adsorption is typically exothermic a possible explanation is that chemisorption might play a more important role than physical adsorption for the adsorption of geosmin by preloaded gac different from physical adsorption which is purely a surface condensation chemisorption involves surface reaction thomas 1961 an increase in temperature may result in more rupture and creation of chemical bonds creating some new adsorption sites on the carbon surface aksu and kabasakal 2004 thus increasing adsorption in addition given its planar molecular structure the geosmin molecule could have an increased planarity at higher temperature which enables it to have more access to the micropores of the adsorbents fontecha cÃ¡mara et al 2006 this may explain why the adsorption of geosmin was more affected by water temperature than mib which has a three dimensional chemical structure note that in most cases the 1 n values in this study were greater than 1 which is different from the reported 1 n values 1 in previous studies that conducted isotherm tests for mib and geosmin chen et al 1997 graham et al 2000 a potential reason for this discrepancy is that this study used preloaded gac i e 6 year old gac for the isotherm test but the previous studies used either virgin gac or pac in preloaded gac nom fouling may render the adsorption of geosmin and mib less favorable thus resulting in a 1 n value greater than 1 in most cases tran et al 2017 there is a high correlation between 1 n and k in the freundlich equation hence it is preferable to define a jcr of these two parameters as a function of temperature rather than individual confidence ranges in fig 2 a the overlapped jcrs for mib adsorption isotherm parameters at the three temperatures indicates that there was no statistically significant effect of temperature for geosmin fig 2b however it was observed that the jcr at 4 c was significantly different from those at 10 c and 20 c it should be noted that the jcrs were set at the 95 confidence level which requires a large difference in solid phase loadings at different temperatures to yield a statistically significant effect e g the geosmin loading at 10 c would need to be at least three times that at 4 c to be significantly different the isotherm tests were then repeated in water containing nom fig 3i and 3ii including gac contactor influent from plant a and dechlorinated toronto tap water the effect of water temperature on geosmin adsorption was found to vary in different water matrices geosmin adsorption in water from plant a did not increase significantly with increasing water temperature fig 3ib however its adsorption in dechlorinated toronto tap water was greatly enhanced when water temperature increased from 4 c to 10 20 c and the temperature effect was more pronounced at low liquid phase concentration 30 ng l fig 3iib fig 3ib and 3iib show that solid phase loadings of geosmin in dechlorinated toronto tap water were much lower than that in water from plant a indicating a stronger competitive adsorption between geosmin and background organic matter bom in dechlorinated toronto tap water the potential reason for this phenomenon is that with the addition of an oxidant like chlorine large humics in natural water might be broken down into smaller organics resulting in a greater amount of low molecular weight aromatic organics in tap water which has been considered to be the key nom fraction that competes with geosmin wang et al 2020 thus it can be concluded that temperature had a greater impact on geosmin adsorption when the competitive adsorption between geosmin and bom was strong a similar observation was reported by schreiber et al 2007 who discovered that the effect of temperature on atrazine adsorption was more distinct in cases with strong competitive adsorption as shown in fig 4 i the overlapped jcrs for mib geosmin adsorption isotherm parameters in gac contactor influent from plant a at three temperatures indicates that there was no statistically significant difference among the fitted freundlich parameter values for the mib geosmin adsorption in dechlorinated toronto tap water fig 4ii however it was found that the jcr at 4 c was significantly different from that at 20 c at the 95 confidence level 3 2 effect of temperature on overall removal breakthrough across the pilot scale gac columns for mib and geosmin at the three different temperatures over 300 bed volumes of treated water 20 h using gac from plant a and dechlorinated toronto tap water is shown in fig 5 the breakthrough curves were plotted over only 300 bed volumes to evaluate the pseudo steady state breakthrough values which represent the current performance of the preloaded gac at different temperatures it has been reported that column tests reach pseudo steady state within this time frame gillogly 1999 huang et al 2019 at low temperatures 4 c and 10 c the breakthrough of mib was approximately 70 but it decreased to 50 when the water temperature was 20 c a similar phenomenon was observed for geosmin breakthrough at different temperatures the breakthrough of geosmin in cold water was greater than that in warm water overall geosmin breakthrough was approximately 30 lower than mib breakthrough which is consistent with full scale experience fig 6 shows the results of the pilot scale column tests using gac of two different ages 1 year old and 6 years old harvested from plant b with dechlorinated toronto tap water the water temperature had a similar effect on the breakthrough of mib and geosmin as was observed on gac from plant a the breakthrough decreased by around 20 as water became warmer from 4 10 c to 20 c as expected the 1 year old gac showed better performance than the 6 year old gac with around 25 and 30 more mib and geosmin removed respectively based on the results it can be summarized that mib geosmin breakthrough was similar at 4 c and 10 c but that removal improved by about 20 30 at 20 c for the three types of gac the pilot scale column test therefore showed a different temperature effect on mib geosmin adsorption compared to the isotherm test which indicated that mib adsorption was comparable at the three temperatures and that geosmin adsorption was similar at 10 c and 20 c but decreased at 4 c the pilot scale column test results depend on both adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics and potential biodegradation whereas the isotherm reflects only adsorption thermodynamics hence it is reasonable to conclude that water temperature had more impact on the adsorption kinetics and potential biodegradation of mib and geosmin than on the adsorption thermodynamics under the conditions tested with more mib and geosmin adsorbed at higher temperatures 3 3 effect of temperature on model prediction 3 3 1 temperature dependent model parameters there are five parameters in the psdm that are temperature dependent two are freundlich isotherm parameters k and 1 n whose temperature dependence was measured experimentally using isotherm tests on ultrapure water two more temperature dependent model parameters are the pore diffusion coefficient d p and surface diffusion coefficients d s whose temperature dependences can be calculated directly using equations eq 8 and eq 12 the values of d p and d s can also be determined using the psdm to fit the batch kinetic test data however in this study the batch kinetic test was conducted at 4 c which would enable the d p and d s values to be determined for that temperature only instead the d p and d s values calculated using the empirical equations were similar to the values errors 5 determined by fitting the model the model fitting results are shown in fig s1 thus using empirical equations instead of batch kinetic results to calculate values for d p and d s is a valid approach the final temperature dependent parameter was overall external mass transfer coefficient k f which describes a combination of film diffusion and potential biodegradation and it was solved by using the pilot scale data along with the psdm to obtain best fit values for k f at each temperature the resulting psdm model output is shown in fig 5 the values of the temperature dependent model parameters are shown in table 3 there is no apparent trend for the estimated k and 1 n values at different temperatures for diffusion coefficients the d p value increased as the water temperature increased but the d s value was approximately 30 orders of magnitude lower than that of d p this is because surface diffusion was not significant with background nom present thus the temperature effect on d s does not appear to meaningfully influence gac performance for both mib and gesomin the fitted k f value did not change significantly when the water temperature increased from 4 c to 10 c however as the temperature increased to 20 c k f doubled 3 3 2 sensitivity analysis of temperature dependent model parameters as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 an analysis was performed to assess the sensitivity of the model output to each temperature dependent model parameter for both mib and geosmin the variations in k f due to temperature change had the greatest impact on the simulated breakthrough value with both ebcts by changing k f from its value at 20 c to its values at 4 c and 10 c breakthrough increased by about 20 changes to d p k and 1 n had no observable impact and as explained previously the overall effect of d s is negligible this is similar to work reported by gillogly 1999 and nie et al 2020 who analyzed the sensitivity of simulated mib breakthrough to psdm model parameters at a fixed temperature by increasing or decreasing parameter values over several orders of magnitude and they also found that film diffusion had the greatest impact on mib breakthrough it is therefore reasonable to theorize that the adsorption of mib and geosmin under the conditions evaluated is a film diffusion controlled process and that the variations in their adsorption caused by temperature change is mainly due to the temperature effect on film diffusion in contrast other studies using trichloroethylene carter and weber 1994 and atrazine knappe et al 1999 reported that intraparticle diffusion d p d s had the greatest impact on breakthrough this may be due to different adsorption characteristics of the target compounds geosmin and mib have been found not to penetrate the adsorbent but instead preferentially adsorb near the external surface of activated carbon matsui et al 2014 so film diffusion instead of pore diffusion may be the rate limiting adsorption step for mib or geosmin 3 3 3 model prediction based on the results of the sensitivity analysis section 3 3 2 it was found that only one temperature dependent model parameter k f had a significant effect on the simulated breakthrough thus it would be relatively straightforward to modify the psdm to include temperature effects by expressing k f as a mathematical function of temperature such a function that fit the data well r2 0 75 0 83 is given in eq 15 and shown in fig 9 the model implies an initial slow and later rapid increase for k f with temperature interestingly this function is in the same form as the arrhenius equation eq 2 this exponential model is also a good fit for the k f values at different temperatures for atrazine and imidacloprid adsorption by virgin gac reported by dudamel et al 2010 which is the only other dataset that could be identified in the literature on this subject however the proposed function is based on only three data points and more data should be collected in future work to properly calibrate and validate the model 15 k f a exp b t where a and b are the fitted constants a represents the fouling index which decreases as the fouling film becomes thicker b quantifies the rate of exponential increase which may depend on the sensitivity of specific compound adsorption to temperature 4 summary and conclusions the effect of water temperature on the adsorption thermodynamics adsorption kinetics and potential biodegradation for mib and geosmin was studied using isotherm tests and pilot scale column tests at three temperatures the isotherm tests indicated that water temperature did not significantly affect the adsorption thermodynamics of mib while there was a moderate impact on geosmin whereby the equilibrium adsorption capacity was lower at 4 c compared to 10 c and 20 c the temperature had a greater impact on geosmin adsorption when there was competitive adsorption between geosmin and nom for the pilot scale column test it was found that mib geosmin breakthrough was similar at 4 c and 10 c but it increased by 20 30 at 20 c it was therefore concluded that water temperature had more impact on the adsorption kinetics and or potential biodegradation of mib and geosmin than on the adsorption thermodynamics under the conditions tested to learn more about the mechanism of the temperature effect the psdm was applied to data from the isotherm tests and pilot scale column tests the values of five temperature dependent parameters in the model 1 n k k f d p and d s were determined at three temperatures a sensitivity analysis revealed that the simulated mib and geosmin breakthrough values were most sensitive to variations in k f caused by temperature change with 15 20 breakthrough increase when temperature decreased from 20 c to 4 10 c an exponential model that uses temperature to calculate k f was proposed which enables the prediction of removals of mib and geosmin by gac at different temperatures perhaps the most immediate benefit of this research is that it demonstrates that the removal of geosmin and mib in fixed bed gac adsorbers is affected by temperature while this may seem intuitively obvious there was a surprising lack of information on this topic in the literature under the conditions of this study removal of the compounds was approximately 20 30 better at temperatures representative of the summer 20 c compared to the winter 4 c utilities often face lower water demands in the winter so the inferior gac performance in controlling a taste and odour event in the winter might be able to be overcome by bringing more gac contactors into service thereby reducing the flow rate in each individual bed to allow for more contact time declaration of competing

efficiency of water treatment processes to abate chlorothalonil tps from drinking water have not yet been evaluated therefore we aimed to investigate the abatement of sulfonic acid and phenol containing chlorothalonil tps from water in full scale waterworks pilot plants and laboratory experiments our hypothesis was that the more electron poor and more polar sulfonic acid tps exhibiting at least one sulfonic acid group r471811 sa r419492 sa r417888 sa and two isomers of r417888 sa sa for sulfonic acid are probably more recalcitrant during oxidative or adsorptive treatment in contrast the less polar phenolic tps syn507900 ph syn548580 ph r611968 ph ph for phenol are probably abated more efficiently by oxidation or adsorption as previously shown for other phenolic compounds kovalova

measurement of the second order rate constant with ozone similar approach as for the sulfonic acid tps was not feasible for the phenolic tps because these reactions are too fast to be observed in batch reactors at environmentally relevant ph values 2 3 3 advanced oxidation to evaluate the potential of aops the second order rate constants were determined for the reactions of oh koh with the tps oh can be produced by a combination of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 with uv irradiation or ozone or at high ph directly from ozone rosenfeldt and linden 2004 staehelin and hoigne 1982 here tps 0 1 Î¼m were exposed to h2o2 1 mm at ph 7 5 in a comparable reactor set up as for uvc photodegradation experiments section 2 3 1 here uva light with emission peak at 367 nm to reduce the experimental effort r471811 sa and syn507900 ph and r417888 sa and r611968 ph respectively were exposed to uva h2o2 in the same vials the second order rate constant koh was determined by competition kinetics using

showed no degradation probably because the oh concentration was too low 10 15 m thus the second order rate constants for sulfonic acid tps were determined by exposure to higher oh concentrations produced from ozone 0 80 Î¼m under alkaline conditions ph 10 0 3 mm naoh with the x ray contrast agent diatrizoic acid as a competitor diatrizoic acid was selected as a competitor due to its low reactivity koh 5 4 108 m 1s 1 real et al 2009 which is of similar order of magnitude as that expected for the sulfonic acid tps degradation by ozone could be excluded due to the low stability of ozone at ph 10 and the very low ozone reactivity of both diatrizoic acid ko3 0 05 m 1s 1 real et al 2009 and sulfonic acid tps 0 04 m 1s 1 see section 3 3 1 and table 1 for details see si a8 2 3 4 activated carbon the potential of adsorption to activated carbon was evaluated by conducting powdered activated carbon batch experiments as the experimental set up does not take into account kinetic effects adsorption might be overestimated compared to granular activated carbon filters in order to compare not only the adsorption behaviour between the chlorothalonil tps but also relative to other micropollutants present in many waterworks the herbicide atrazine and the x ray contrast agent diatrizoic acid were also included in the experiments as reference compounds adsorption to activated

kiefer et al 2019 or si a4 quantification results including limits of quantification loqs 0 2 10 ngl 1 in environmental samples relative recoveries average 85 110 and relative standard deviation 20 across spiked samples in environmental samples and isotope labelled internal standards are provided in si b1 and si b2 the chlorothalonil tps r419492 sa and syn548580 ph were quantified retrospectively because reference material was received after analysis for quantification and quality control eleven calibration standards one blank sample six samples from drinking water treatment and six corresponding spiked samples were enriched and analysed section 2 4 1 and 2 4 2 this calibration model was applied to the previously measured samples the concentration of syn548580 ph deviated less than 20 in the six samples which were measured twice however in case of r419492 sa the concentration results differed by a factor of two due to the early retention time of r419492 sa a suitable internal standard was not available therefore r419492 sa concentrations were multiplied by two in the retrospectively quantified samples it should be noted that measurement uncertainty for r419492 is expected to be higher 0 5 2 reported concentration than in case of the other chlorothalonil tps 0 7 1 5 reported concentration the abatement of chlorothalonil tps in the waterworks was compared to the abatement of the sweetener acesulfame and the x ray contrast agent diatrizoic acid in contrast to acesulfame diatrizoic acid could not be quantified because reference material for diatrizoic acid was not included in the multi component standard solution for quantification of the environmental samples however abatement was calculated from differences in the response ratios of diatrizoic acid and its structurally identical isotope labelled internal standard before and after treatment to estimate the error of the calculated abatement efficiencies in water treatment due to measurement uncertainty each sample taken along the treatment train was measured in triplicate the uncertainty in removal was calculated based on the standard deviation of the measurement triplicates using gaussian error propagation in addition three samples were enriched and measured in triplicate to assess the reproducibility of sample enrichment the standard deviations of the triplicate measurement concentrations and the enrichment triplicates was comparable to determine the extent of chlorothalonil tps in groundwater concentrations were quantified in 60 groundwater samples section 2 1 that have been analysed using a comparable method as the one used for the environmental samples in this study the major differences were a lower enrichment factor 75 instead of 100 and a lower injection volume 140 instead of 150 Î¼l corresponding to 10 5 ml of the original sample instead of 15 ml additionally only 35 isotope labelled internal standards were spiked the samples were analysed together with four calibration standards 1 10 100 1000 ngl 1 and three spiked samples 10 100 250 ngl 1 containing among other compounds the chlorothalonil tps r471811 sa r417888 sa syn507900 ph and r61198 ph the concentrations of the chlorothalonil tps r419492 sa and syn545850 ph were estimated based on the calibration standards measured separately see above 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorothalonil tps in drinking water resources fig 1 illustrates the concentration ranges of the chlorothalonil tps in different drinking water resources in addition to the tps presented in fig 1 the tps r611965 carboxylic acid and r418503 sa were investigated with reference material loq 10 ngl 1 but never detected syn548581 sa which is the r417888 sa isomer that we previously identified only tentatively based on comparison of the isotope pattern predicted ms ms spectrum and retention time kiefer et al 2019 was now confirmed with reference material fig si a9 as expected none of the tps were found above the loq of 0 2 10 ngl 1 in rain water or ultrapure water tp r471811 sa was detected in all other samples even in groundwater with very low anthropogenic impact in surface water river rhine 53 ngl 1 lake zurich 5 ngl 1 and in bottled water evian water 6 ngl 1 the two other sulfonic acid tps r417888 sa and r419492 sa were detected in 86 and 65 of samples without rain and ultrapure water whereas the phenols r611968 ph syn507900 ph syn548580 ph were detected less frequently in 10 30 of the samples and at lower concentrations fig 1 in the four surface waters investigated 3 rivers 1 lake all tps had concentrations below 100 ngl 1 whereas at least one tp was above 100 ngl 1 in 40 out of 73 groundwater samples it should be noted that concentrations in rivers may be subject to stronger seasonal fluctuations compared to concentrations in groundwater for a compilation of all quantitative data refer to si b1 and si b2 based on long term monitoring data the 60 groundwater monitoring sites were pre classified as influenced by agricultural micropollutants 20 sites micropollutants from wastewater 20 sites often influenced by river bank filtration or with only low anthropogenic influence 20 sites section 2 1 as expected the median concentration of the chlorothalonil tps was higher in groundwater samples influenced by agriculture 515 ngl 1 than in groundwater samples pre classified as wastewater impacted 99 ngl 1 or in samples with only low anthropogenic influence 19 ngl 1 the phenols play a minor role for the drinking water quality since they exceeded 100 ngl 1 in only 3 of samples whereas the sulfonic acids r471811 sa r417888 sa and r419492 sa exceeded 100 ngl 1 in 52 14 and 14 of samples respectively the concentration ratios between the tps vary strongly from sample to sample si b1 for example tp r471811 sa was found at 2 50 times median 7 4 higher concentrations compared to its direct precursor compound tp r417888 sa these differences could be related to a different formation rate and or transport behavior the less polar tp r417888 sa is more affected by sorption than the more polar tp r471811 sa therefore in case of tp r417888 sa the degree of retardation during transport through the unsaturated zone might depend more strongly on the site specific soil sediment characteristics e g organic carbon than in the case of tp r471811 sa in addition more r417888 sa will be oxidized to r471811 sa with increasing residence time depending e g on size of soil sediment particles in the biologically more active aerobic top soil therefore we speculate that the concentration ratio between the tps r471811 sa and r417888 sa will increase with increasing organic carbon content and residence time in the unsaturated zone 3 2 abatement of chlorothalonil tps during drinking water treatment fig 2 provides an overview of the abatement by granular activated carbon filtration ozonation and uv disinfection in different waterworks while fig 3 illustrates the abatement of the three sulfonic acid tps along the treatment train of waterworks a and b phenolic tps were not detected waterworks c and d showed only very low concentrations of chlorothalonil tps in the raw water and were therefore not discussed in detail lake zurich and river limmat both 7 ngl 1 see si b2 for all quantitative data sand filtration and subsequent infiltration to the aquifer followed by abstraction did not lead to a decrease of the concentrations fig 3 left which is in accordance with the high mobility and persistence of the sulfonic acid tps efsa 2018 whereas the sulfonic acid tps were stable during ozonation and uv disinfection granular activated carbon filtration led to an abatement fig 3 however only very fresh activated carbon specific throughput 23 and 25 m3kg 1 waterworks a and b was capable of sufficiently abating all sulfonic acid tps r471811 sa 80 abatement r417888 sa r419492 sa below loq for slightly older activated carbon specific throughput 55 m3kg 1 waterworks a no retention of r471811 sa was observed whereas r419492 sa was still abated by 55 and r417888 sa was below loq an activated carbon filter with a specific throughput of 215 m3kg 1 waterworks b retained only the sulfonic acid tp with the highest water n octanol distribution coefficient considering the speciation at ph 7 log dow ph7 r417888 sa 58 abatement the oldest activated carbon filter specific throughput 305 m3kg 1 waterworks a had higher effluent than influent concentrations for all sulfonic acid tps indicating slight leaching from the filter the poor retention behaviour for r471811 sa was comparable to the breakthrough behaviour of the x ray contrast agent diatrizoic acid fig 2 whereas both compounds were still abated by 80 by fresh activated carbon specific throughput 25 m3kg 1 neither r471811 sa nor diatrizoic acid were abated by slightly older activated carbon specific throughput 55 and 305 m3kg 1 diatrizoic acid was not present in the raw water of waterworks b it should be noted that the results from the two waterworks a and b are in good agreement although different granular activated carbons were used waterworks a bituminous coal filtrasorb 400 calgon carbon corporation waterworks b bituminous coal hydraffin xc 30 donau carbon in intensively used agricultural areas managed aquifer recharge can decrease groundwater contamination with chlorothalonil tps by dilution because surface waters are usually less polluted with chlorothalonil tps section 3 1 three of the investigated groundwater abstraction wells were close to a river 40 730 m which was only slightly contaminated concentration sum of chlorothalonil tps 100 ngl 1 in a grab sample with increasing distance to the river the concentration sum of the chlorothalonil tps in the abstracted groundwater increased 2 abstraction wells 40 m from river 85 and 220 ngl 1 concentrations may differ due to a different pumping regime before sampling leading to different proportions of river water in the abstracted sample abstraction well 730 m from river 420 ngl 1 si b2 however managed aquifer recharge may introduce other organic micropollutants such as wastewater derived compounds hollender et al 2018 accordingly we observed higher concentrations of the sweetener acesulfame in abstraction wells close to the river compared to an abstraction well with larger distance to the river grab sample in river 280 ngl 1 2 abstraction wells 40 m from river 120 and 34 ngl 1 concentrations may differ due to a different pumping regime before sampling abstraction well 730 m from river 11 ngl 1 si b2 the phenolic tps were partly abated by uv disinfection with a large variability 57 43 fig 2 si b3 waterworks e and f no clear difference in abatement between the uv disinfection systems with low pressure hg lamps monochromatic uv light 254 nm or medium pressure hg lamps polychromatic uv light was observed fig 2 uv systems at waterworks are usually installed for disinfection requiring only low fluences i e 400 jm 2 according to german austrian and swiss legislation dvgw 2006 Ã¶norm 2001 svgw 2010 despite the low fluences abatement of some organic micropollutants has been reported scheurer et al 2014 observed 30 abatement of the sweetener acesulfame at a waterworks in basel switzerland and similar acesulfame abatement 30 50 fig 2 was observed at the uv disinfection systems in this study in addition to acesulfame we also observed partial abatement of diatrizoic acid 30 40 fig 2 in contrast uv disinfection did not affect the concentration of the sulfonic acid tps waterworks a fig 3 the slight abatement or formation observed at three other uv systems fig 2 likely reflects uncertainty from sampling and sample analysis it can be asked whether the investigated tps may also be formed in the waterworks from chlorothalonil or chlorothalonil tps chlorothalonil itself was not analysed in this study as it does not ionize sufficiently in electrospray however based on laboratory and lysimeter experiments performed within the eu pesticide registration process efsa 2018 and a german groundwater monitoring program lubw 2011 the presence of chlorothalonil in the raw waters in relevant concentrations is unlikely accordingly the water supplier operating waterworks b regularly checks for chlorothalonil in the raw water using gas chromatography electron ionization mass spectrometry but has never detected this compound loq 20 ngl 1 furthermore a formation of one target tp from another target tp was only observed in small amounts in the laboratory experiments i e 2 r471811 sa was formed from r417888 sa at ph 10 for each ozone dose including the control without ozone si a8 indicating very slow basic hydrolysis section 3 3 therefore we expect that the results of our study are not influenced by chlorothalonil tps formed in the waterworks 3 3 laboratory experiments table 1 provides the results from laboratory experiments with ozone uv and aops and corresponding literature data for common micropollutants for comparison si b4 to si b10 show the experimental data si a5 to si a10 describe the calculations of the reported values 3 3 1 uv irradiation in full scale water treatment the phenolic tps were partially abated by uv disinfection 57 43 whereas the sulfonic acid tps were persistent section 3 2 fig 2 the uvc irradiation experiments confirmed the higher photodegradability at 254 nm of the phenolic tps exhibiting higher photon fluence based rate constants table 1 the fast decay of the phenolic tps relates to their higher quantum yields compared to the sulfonic acid tps while all tps have moderate to high molar absorptivities table 1 fig si a1 and si a2 using the photon fluence based rate constants determined we calculated the theoretical abatement by uv disinfection si a5 assuming an applied uv dose of 400 jm 2 as prescribed in switzerland germany and austria dvgw 2006 Ã¶norm 2001 svgw 2010 theoretically 0 2 of the sulfonic acids and 2 5 of the phenols should be abated under such uv disinfection conditions table si a10 however abatement in full scale treatment fig 2 was higher compared to the estimates from uvc treatment alone this difference might be explained by indirect phototransformation due to production of reactive intermediates that can contribute to the removal of micropollutants i e reactions with radicals or triplet states generated by photoexcitation of dissolved organic matter or nitrate canonica et al 1995 mark et al 1996 zepp et al 1987 especially nitrate may play an important role because groundwater polluted with chlorothalonil tps often has elevated nitrate concentrations since both originate from mainly agricultural sources median of nitrate concentration in groundwater samples with phenolic tps 20 mgl 1 si b1 in contrast dissolved organic matter concentrations are usually low in groundwater doc in the 60 groundwater samples 2 1 mgl 1 indirect phototransformation is especially important for compounds susceptible to oxidation such as phenols canonica et al 2008 in addition to disinfection uv irradiation is used to generate oh in uv based aops the fluence applied in uv based aops 5000 10000 jm 2 chuang et al 2017 are about 10 25 times higher compared to uv disinfection so also direct phototransfomation can become relevant in case of the phenols an abatement of 24 for r611968 ph and 37 for syn507900 ph is estimated for a uv dose of 7500 jm 2 and the respective rate constants for 90 abatement of the phenolic tps by direct photolysis 38000 64000 jm 2 would be required for the sulfonic acid tps uv doses would need to be even ten times higher table si a10 3 3 2 ozonation in the ozonation step of waterworks b the sulfonic acid tps were not degraded section 3 2 this is in agreement with the very low second order rate constant for the reaction with ozone ko3 0 04 m 1s 1 table 1 only micropollutants with second order rate constants 10 m 1s 1 are significantly abated during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 e g acesulfame ko3 88 m 1s 1 table 1 was abated by 85 during ozonation waterworks b and c fig 2 the measured second order rate constants support our hypothesis that ozone only minimally reacts with the sulfonic acid tps because the benzene rings have six electron withdrawing substituents such as chlorine sulfonic acid cyano and or amide groups fig 1 ozone refractory compounds e g atrazine table 1 are mostly abated by oh that are formed from ozone decay and ozone reactions with dissolved organic matter as secondary oxidants von sonntag and von gunten 2012 however the sulfonic acid containing tps are also very refractory against oh koh 5 0 107 m 1s 1 table 1 explaining why no abatement was observed in waterworks b for these compounds in contrast the more electron rich phenolic tps are clearly more reactive as expected both with ozone and oh ko3 104 m 1s 1 table 1 to what extent the phenolic tps will be abated in full scale treatment cannot be concluded from the data presented here because the concentrations of the phenolic tps were loq in the raw water of waterworks b and c however hollender et al 2009 showed for a wastewater treatment plant with 5 2 0 6 mgl 1 doc and hydraulic retention times of 3 7 10 1 min in the ozone reactor that micropollutants with ko3 104 m 1s 1

substituent descriptors hammett constants to predict the second order rate constants for the reactions with ozone the proposed qsar was applied to predict the second order rate constants of r611968 ph and syn507900 ph and in addition of the phenolic tp which was not investigated in laboratory experiments syn548580 ph see si a7 the second order rate constants of r611968 ph and syn507900 ph predicted by qsar were on average 2 4 times higher than the measured values a factor 2 4 is within the uncertainty described by lee and von gunten 2012 the predicted second order rate constant of syn548580 ph was three to five times higher than the predicted second order rate constants of syn507900 ph and r611968 ph indicating higher abatement 3 3 3 advanced oxidation overall a broader range of micropollutants can be transformed in aops compared to ozonation because the oh generated in aops is a less selective oxidant von gunten 2018 moreover direct phototransformation by uv irradiation can contribute to micropollutant abatement depending on the aop applied e g uv h2o2 uv free chlorine katsoyiannis et al 2011 the second order rate constant for the reaction of r611968 ph with oh was 2 7 0 6 109 m 1s 1 which is similar to e g atrazine and many other micropollutants table 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for syn507900 ph the second order rate constant could not be determined because it was already reacting by direct photochemical reactions during uva irradiation and an enhancement of the decay rates could not be observed in uva h2o2 si a9 si b8 however because of their similar structures we assume that the second order rate constant for the reaction of syn507900 ph with oh is in the same range as for r611968 ph for a treatment plant with reverse osmosis followed by uv h2o2 marron et al 2019 calculated pollutant abatement depending on their second order rate constants for the reaction with oh whereby they assumed that the uv h2o2 reactor is designed to remove 1 4 dioxane

60 70 due to reaction with oh in contrast to the phenolic tps the abatement of the sulfonic acids koh 5 0 107 m 1s 1 is expected to be negligible in o3 h2o2 or uv h2o2 based on these low reactivities both with the rather unselective oxidant oh and the selective oxidant ozone it is likely that sulfonic acids are also persistent towards other oxidants such as hocl clo2 or sulfate radicals 3 3 4 activated carbon adsorption to powdered activated carbon was investigated in a natural groundwater doc 1 1 mgl 1 spiked with four chlorothalonil tps and for comparison with diatrizoic acid anionic at ph 7 predicted log dow ph7 0 6 and atrazine neutral at ph 7 predicted log dow ph7 2 2 two micropollutants with well known adsorption behaviour fig si a7 and si a8 show the abatement as a function of the powdered activated carbon dose according to this the affinity to activated carbon decreases in the following order atrazine r611968 ph r417888 sa syn507900 ph r4718111 sa diatrizoic acid the laboratory experiments showed a higher activated carbon affinity of r417888 sa compared to r471811 sa which was confirmed by the better retention of r417888 sa in the waterworks section 3 2 and is in accordance with the higher hydrophobicity fig 1 higher log dow ph7 however hydrophobicity is not the only parameter governing adsorption to activated carbon kovalova et al 2013b diatrizoic acid which has a predicted log dow ph7 comparable to r417888 sa showed similar adsorption behaviour to r471811 sa this was observed as well in full scale section 3 2 i e diatrizoic acid can be used in waterworks as predictor for the expected breakthrough of r471811 sa 3 3 5 reverse osmosis the reverse osmosis pilot plant was sampled five times over a period of fourteen weeks the corresponding results are summarized in si b10 chemical analyses focused on the two chlorothalonil tps with the highest concentrations r471811 sa r417888 sa two additional pesticide tps chloridazon desphenyl log dow ph7 0 8 chloridazon desphenyl methyl log dow ph7 0 6 and nitrate which are typical groundwater contaminants in many agricultural areas were also investigated the phenolic tps were completely removed not detectable in permeate i e 10 ng l raw water 30 100 ng l furthermore the chlorothalonil tp r417888 sa and chloridazon desphenyl methyl were not detectable in the permeate raw water 200 280 ngl 1 and 30 33 ngl 1 whereas the chlorothalonil tp r471811 sa was abated by 98 raw water 1200 2100 ngl 1 permeate 15 20 ngl 1 nitrate by 95 98 raw water 16 5 18 6 mgl 1 permeate 0 4 0 9 mgl 1 and the pesticide tp chloridazon desphenyl was only abated by 87 94 raw water 440 560 ngl 1 permeate 30 63 ngl 1 the lower removal of chloridazon desphenyl compared to the chlorothalonil tps may be related to differences in the molecular properties in contrast to the chlorothalonil tps chloridazon desphenyl is uncharged and has a smaller molecular mass and volume r471811 sa 348 gmol 1 23 nm3 chloridazon desphenyl 146 gmol 1 11 nm3 predicted by jchem for excel version 17 1 2300 1455 chemaxon ltd 3 4 practical implications the sulfonic acid tps are detected more frequently in drinking water resources than the phenolic tps and exhibit higher concentrations often exceeding the swiss drinking water standard of 100 ngl 1 chlorothalonil has recently been banned in the eu and in switzerland blw 2019a european commission 2019 so chlorothalonil will no longer be applied in large parts of europe however it is difficult to predict how long these tps will continue to be present in groundwater and for how long water suppliers will face raw water polluted with chlorothalonil tps the duration depends on various factors such as the exact dissipation time groundwater recharge rate groundwater residence time and dilution with other water sources in the respective aquifer experience from other pesticides with similar properties related to biodegradability and application periods and polar tps is scarce however studies in germany and switzerland showed no concentration decline for the tps of the herbicide chloridazon within five years after the last application in two shallow aquifers with average groundwater residence times 15 20 years hintze and hunkeler 2019 neukum and meyer 2019 model predictions are uncertain but indicate that a decrease in chloridazon tp concentration by 90 will take more than 20 years neukum and meyer 2019 both sampling along water treatment trains and laboratory experiments indicate that the sulfonic acid tps of chlorothalonil are persistent in most water treatment processes photochemical and oxidative processes uv irradiation ozonation and aops based on oh are not able to abate the sulfonic acid containing tps in contrast activated carbon may offer a chance to abate the sulfonic acid tps to a certain extent but efficiency varies strongly among tps to remove all chlorothalonil tps activated carbon needs to be exchanged or regenerated very frequently approximately as often as for the removal of the x ray contrast agent diatrizoic acid causing high economic and ecological costs reverse osmosis abated 98 of chlorothalonil tps however this is an energy intensive process and the reject water 20 30 of treated water needs to be treated or disposed efficient post treatment processes are not known and disposal to lakes and rivers is questionable because the pollutants are returned to the water cycle 4 conclusions chlorothalonil tps are widespread in drinking water resources one tp r471811 sa was detected in all 77 samples even in groundwater with low anthropogenic impact the sulfonic acid containing tps r471811 sa r419492 sa r417888 sa exceeded concentrations of 100 ngl 1 in 14 52 of the samples while the phenol containing tps syn507900 ph syn548580 ph r611968 ph were less frequently detected in 97 of samples the phenol containing tps were below concentrations of 100 ngl 1 although chlorothalonil has recently been banned in europe the tps of chlorothalonil are expected to challenge drinking water suppliers for many years due to their persistence in the environment and in water treatment processes the phenolic tps can be removed by various treatment techniques such as ozonation aops and activated carbon even uv disinfection may lead to a certain extent of removal in contrast to the phenolic tps the less electron rich sulfonic acids are more persistent and can be removed neither by ozonation nor by oh based aops under typical water treatment conditions the sulfonic acids adsorb to activated carbon to varying extents depending on their polarity for an efficient removal of the tp with the highest concentrations granular activated carbon needs to be exchanged more frequently than for other common micropollutants reverse osmosis was able to abate the chlorothalonil tps by 98 however the reject water needs to be disposed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17749,chlorothalonil a fungicide applied for decades worldwide has recently been banned in the european union eu and switzerland due to its carcinogenicity and the presence of potentially toxic transformation products tps in groundwater the spread and concentration range of chlorothalonil tps in different drinking water resources was examined 73 groundwater and four surface water samples mainly from switzerland the chlorothalonil sulfonic acid tps r471811 r419492 r417888 occurred more frequently and at higher concentrations detected in 65 100 of the samples 2200 ngl 1 than the phenolic tps syn507900 syn548580 r611968 detected in 10 30 of the samples 130 ngl 1 the tp r471811 was found in all samples and even in 52 of the samples above 100 ngl 1 the drinking water standard in switzerland and other european countries therefore the abatement of chlorothalonil tps was investigated in laboratory and pilot scale experiments and along the treatment train of various water works

pesticide metabolite water treatment groundwater ozonation activated carbon 1 introduction chlorothalonil a broad spectrum fungicide has recently been banned in the eu and switzerland because of its carcinogenic properties the risks to fish and amphibians and the expected contamination of groundwater with chlorothalonil tps blw 2019a european commission 2019 in switzerland chlorothalonil had predominantly been used for grain and vegetable cultivation but its use had also been approved for viticulture and non agricultural land chlorothalonil has been applied in high amounts for decades first registration in the usa in 1966 epa 1999 as shown by the sales data in switzerland 45 t a 2017 and germany 1000 2500 t a 2017 where chlorothalonil was among the ten most sold pesticides in 2017 blw 2019b bvl 2018 due to the toxicity of the parent compound and insufficient toxicological data for the tps the european food safety agency efsa recommended to provisionally classify chlorothalonil tps as relevant pesticide tps in 2018 efsa 2018 implying an eu drinking water standard of 100 ngl 1 european commission 1998 to our knowledge the eu member states have not yet decided on the drinking water relevance of chlorothalonil tps e g in germany the previous classification as non relevant or not evaluated still applies resulting in a higher drinking water standard however some european countries such as denmark and france apply the same drinking water standard of 100 ngl 1 to all pesticide tps some non european countries e g australia and the usa define individual risk based thresholds but so far only for a limited number of pesticides and tps laabs et al 2015 as recommended by the european commission 2019 switzerland recently classified chlorothalonil as carcinogen category 1b thereby declaring all groundwater tps as relevant irrespectively of their toxicity following the eu guidance document sanco 221 2000 rev 10 final european commission 2003 to reduce drinking water contamination with organic micropollutants various treatment processes exist such as i managed aquifer recharge hollender et al 2018 maeng et al 2011 ii activated carbon treatment delgado et al 2012 westerhoff et al 2005 iii ozonation hÃ¼bner et al 2012 von gunten 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 westerhoff et al 2005 iv aops e g uv h2o2 o3 h2o2 uv cl2 chuang et al 2017 guo

on physical chemical properties of a compound managed aquifer recharge is most effective for less polar and well degradable compounds benotti et al 2012 maeng et al 2011 similarly activated carbon filtration retains especially semi to non polar micropollutants westerhoff et al 2005 while the oxidant ozone o3 selectively transforms mainly electron rich compounds e g phenols oh produced during ozone decomposition and in aops are less selective and react with a broader spectrum of organic compounds von sonntag and von gunten 2012 while these oxidative methods may only partially abate the micropollutant load and can produce reaction products reverse osmosis is capable of removing most micropollutants to a large extent however operational costs of reverse osmosis systems are high taheran et al 2016 and the highly concentrated reject water that is produced requires disposal umar et al 2014 in a recent suspect screening for more than 1000 pesticide tps including 25 chlorothalonil tps in swiss groundwater we have detected eight different chlorothalonil tps six of them reported for the first time kiefer et al 2019 the chlorothalonil tp r471811 was even found in all 31 groundwater samples with concentrations up to 2700 ngl 1 due to the high usage of chlorothalonil worldwide chlorothalonil tps may be a widespread threat for drinking water quality however the efficiency of water treatment processes to abate chlorothalonil tps from drinking water have not yet been evaluated therefore we aimed to investigate the abatement of sulfonic acid and phenol containing chlorothalonil tps from water in full scale waterworks pilot plants and laboratory experiments our hypothesis was that the more electron poor and more polar sulfonic acid tps exhibiting at least one sulfonic acid group r471811 sa r419492 sa r417888 sa and two isomers of r417888 sa sa for sulfonic acid are probably more recalcitrant during oxidative or adsorptive treatment in contrast the less polar phenolic tps syn507900 ph syn548580 ph r611968 ph ph for phenol are probably abated more efficiently by oxidation or adsorption as previously shown for other phenolic compounds kovalova et al 2013a lee et al 2005 first chlorothalonil tps were monitored in different drinking water resources such as in lakes rivers and groundwater to obtain more information on the scope of chlorothalonil tps contamination second the fate of chlorothalonil tps in a full scale water treatment train consisting of activated carbon ozonation and uv disinfection was investigated additional laboratory and pilot scale experiments were carried out to supplement the full scale observations regarding activated carbon ozonation and uv disinfection and to test additional advanced treatment processes aops reverse osmosis 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water resources and waterworks to investigate the fate of chlorothalonil tps in water treatment samples were taken along the treatment train of eight waterworks table si a1 in february 2019 waterworks a abstracts raw water from the river rhine suspended matter is removed in a settling pond followed by a rapid sand filter

sampled in switzerland the water from these wells or springs is delivered to the consumer as drinking water either without further treatment with only minor treatment uv disinfection or after mixing with water from other sources table si a1 waterworks e i samples were collected in laboratory glass bottles previously annealed at 500 c 500 ml bottles simax kavalier czech republic in february 2019 and then frozen at 20 c until sample enrichment and measurement six field blanks consisting of ultrapure water 18 mÏcm barnstead nanopure diamond system and elga purelab chorus filled in sampling bottles transferred to a second bottle during sampling and frozen until enrichment and measurement did not show detectable concentrations of the target analytes demonstrating that no contamination occurred during sample handling and analysis furthermore rain water from dÃ¼bendorf vicinity of zurich 431 m above sea level switzerland and jungfraujoch 3571 m above sea level switzerland was collected and analysed as background controls from hypothetically uncontaminated field sources since evian water is used in many laboratories for calibration standard preparation additionally evian water bottled in polyethylene terephthalate pet was enriched and analysed as a blank sample to investigate the occurrence of chlorothalonil tps in groundwater the major drinking water resource in switzerland we also present semi quantitative data for 60 groundwater samples collected in may and august 2018 within the swiss national groundwater monitoring naqua www bafu admin ch naqua the 60 groundwater monitoring sites were selected based on long term monitoring data twenty sites were known to have very low overall micropollutant concentrations whereas 40 sites were chosen because micropollutants from urban or agricultural sources had been detected in the past these samples were analysed using a comparable analytical method as described in section 2 4 2 2 stock solutions and chemicals stock solutions for liquid chromatography high resolution tandem mass spectrometry lc hrms ms analyses were prepared depending on compound solubility in ethanol methanol or ethanol water 1 1 volumetrically at a concentration of 0 1 or 1 gl 1 as organic solvents may influence ozonation and photodegradation experiments stock solutions for laboratory experiments except for activated carbon

available asca gmbh germany syngenta switzerland were analysed in the environmental water samples section 2 1 the tps differ in their functional groups fig 1 all tps contain at least one amide group three of the tps have at least one hydroxyl group phenolic tps whereas the other three tps are characterized by at least one sulfonic acid group sulfonic acid tps for the laboratory experiments two phenolic tps r611968 ph syn507900 ph and two sulfonic acid tps r471811 sa r417888 sa were selected as test compounds and it was assumed that structurally related tps would behave similarly during water treatment the four tps were selected due to lower measurement uncertainty compared to r419492 sa and syn548580 ph 2 3 laboratory and pilot scale experiments abatement of micropollutants with ozone or to a lesser extent with oh or degradation by uv photolysis can depend on the speciation of organic compounds such as phenols for the phenolic tps considered here r611968 ph and syn507900 ph experimentally determined acid base equilibrium constants pka were not available so the exact speciation under environmentally relevant ph values is not known however the predicted pka values 4 1 and 4 7 fig 1 predicted with jchem for office version 17 1 2300 1455 chemaxon ltd are more than two units below environmentally relevant ph values indicating the dominance of the anionic phenolate species 99 to obtain data applicable to most waterworks all laboratory experiments were conducted at ph 7 5 using a 5 mm phosphate buffer unless stated otherwise laboratory experiments were performed individually for each compound unless stated otherwise samples from laboratory or pilot scale experiments were analysed without prior enrichment 2 3 1 uvc irradiation photodegradation under uvc

glass vials in presence of tert butanol 50 mm to scavenge oh for details see si a7 other compounds for which reliable second order rate constants were reported e g carbamazepine clarithromycin were also tested or considered as competitors but finally not used either due to higher reactivity with ozone carbamazepine ko3 3 105 m 1s 1 huber et al 2003 or analytical problems clarithromycin direct measurement of the second order rate constant with ozone similar approach as for the sulfonic acid tps was not feasible for the phenolic tps because these reactions are too fast to be observed in batch reactors at environmentally relevant ph values 2 3 3 advanced oxidation to evaluate the potential of aops the second order rate constants were determined for the reactions of oh koh with the tps oh can be produced by a combination of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 with uv irradiation or ozone or at high ph directly from ozone rosenfeldt and linden 2004 staehelin and hoigne 1982 here tps 0 1 Î¼m were exposed to h2o2 1 mm at ph 7 5 in a comparable reactor set up as for uvc photodegradation experiments section 2 3 1 here uva light with emission peak at 367 nm to reduce the experimental effort r471811 sa and syn507900 ph and r417888 sa and r611968 ph respectively were exposed to uva h2o2 in the same vials the second order rate constant koh was determined by competition kinetics using benzoic acid as a reference compound exhibiting similar reactivity as the tps 10 Î¼m koh 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 for details see si a9 using this experimental set up the sulfonic acid tps showed no degradation probably because the oh concentration was too low 10 15 m thus the second order rate constants for sulfonic acid tps were determined by exposure to higher oh concentrations produced from ozone 0 80 Î¼m under alkaline conditions ph 10 0 3 mm naoh with the x ray contrast agent diatrizoic acid as a competitor diatrizoic acid was selected as a competitor due to its low reactivity koh 5 4 108 m 1s 1 real et al 2009 which is of similar order of magnitude as that expected for the sulfonic acid tps degradation by ozone could be excluded due to the low stability of ozone at ph 10 and the very low ozone reactivity of both diatrizoic acid ko3 0 05 m 1s 1 real et al 2009 and sulfonic acid tps 0 04 m 1s 1 see section 3 3 1 and table 1 for details see si a8 2 3 4 activated carbon the potential of adsorption to activated carbon was evaluated by conducting powdered activated carbon batch experiments as the experimental set up does not take into account kinetic effects adsorption might be overestimated compared to granular activated carbon filters in order to compare not only the adsorption behaviour between the chlorothalonil tps but also relative to other micropollutants present in many waterworks the herbicide atrazine and the x ray contrast agent diatrizoic acid were also included in the experiments as reference compounds adsorption to activated carbon is affected by the water matrix and micropollutant concentration delgado et al 2012 knappe et al 1998 to simulate real water conditions as closely as possible groundwater doc 1 1 mgl 1 electrical conductivity 840 Î¼scm 1 was spiked to a target concentration of 500 ngl 1 for each tp test solution 0 05 meoh adsorption experiments were not performed for each chlorothalonil tp individually because it was assumed that the competition for adsorption sites between the chlorothalonil tps and natural organic matter nom low mgl 1 range and further anthropogenic micropollutants

across spiked samples in environmental samples and isotope labelled internal standards are provided in si b1 and si b2 the chlorothalonil tps r419492 sa and syn548580 ph were quantified retrospectively because reference material was received after analysis for quantification and quality control eleven calibration standards one blank sample six samples from drinking water treatment and six corresponding spiked samples were enriched and analysed section 2 4 1 and 2 4 2 this calibration model was applied to the previously measured samples the concentration of syn548580 ph deviated less than 20 in the six samples which were measured twice however in case of r419492 sa the concentration results differed by a factor of two due to the early retention time of r419492 sa a suitable internal standard was not available therefore r419492 sa concentrations were multiplied by two in the retrospectively quantified samples it should be noted that measurement uncertainty for r419492 is expected to be higher 0 5 2 reported concentration than in case of the other chlorothalonil tps 0 7 1 5 reported concentration the abatement of chlorothalonil tps in the waterworks was compared to the abatement of the sweetener acesulfame and the x ray contrast agent diatrizoic acid in contrast to acesulfame diatrizoic acid could not be quantified because reference material for diatrizoic acid was not included in the multi component standard solution for quantification of the environmental samples however abatement was calculated from differences in the response ratios of diatrizoic acid and its structurally identical isotope labelled internal standard before and after treatment to estimate the error of the calculated abatement efficiencies in water treatment due to measurement uncertainty each sample taken along the treatment train was measured in triplicate the uncertainty in removal was calculated based on the standard deviation of the measurement triplicates using gaussian error propagation in addition three samples were enriched and measured in triplicate to assess the reproducibility of sample enrichment the standard deviations of the triplicate measurement concentrations and the enrichment triplicates was comparable to determine the extent of chlorothalonil tps in groundwater concentrations were quantified in 60 groundwater samples section 2 1 that have been analysed using a comparable method as the one used for the environmental samples in this study the major differences were a lower enrichment factor 75 instead of 100 and a lower injection volume 140 instead of 150 Î¼l corresponding to 10 5 ml of the original sample instead of 15 ml additionally only 35 isotope labelled internal standards were spiked the samples were analysed together with four calibration standards 1 10 100 1000 ngl 1 and three spiked samples 10 100 250 ngl 1 containing among other compounds the chlorothalonil tps r471811 sa r417888 sa syn507900 ph and r61198 ph the concentrations of the chlorothalonil tps r419492 sa and syn545850 ph were estimated based on the calibration standards measured separately see above 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorothalonil tps in drinking water resources fig 1 illustrates the concentration ranges of the chlorothalonil tps in different drinking water resources in addition to the tps presented in fig 1 the tps r611965 carboxylic acid and r418503 sa were investigated with reference material loq 10 ngl 1 but never detected syn548581 sa which is the r417888 sa isomer that we previously identified only tentatively based on comparison of the isotope pattern predicted ms ms spectrum and retention time kiefer et al 2019 was now confirmed with reference material fig si a9 as expected none of the tps were found above the loq of 0 2 10 ngl 1 in rain water or ultrapure water tp r471811 sa was detected in all other samples even in groundwater with very low anthropogenic impact in surface water river rhine 53 ngl 1 lake zurich 5 ngl 1 and in bottled water evian water 6 ngl 1 the two other sulfonic acid tps r417888 sa and r419492 sa were detected in 86 and 65 of samples without rain and ultrapure water whereas the phenols r611968 ph syn507900 ph syn548580 ph were detected less frequently in 10 30 of the samples and at lower concentrations fig 1 in the four surface waters investigated 3 rivers 1 lake all tps had concentrations below 100 ngl 1 whereas at least one tp was above 100 ngl 1 in 40 out of 73 groundwater samples it should be noted that concentrations in rivers may be subject to stronger seasonal fluctuations compared to concentrations in groundwater for a compilation of all quantitative data refer to si b1 and si b2 based on long term monitoring data the 60 groundwater monitoring sites were pre classified as influenced by agricultural micropollutants 20 sites micropollutants from wastewater 20 sites often influenced by river bank filtration or with only low anthropogenic influence 20 sites section 2 1 as expected the median concentration of the chlorothalonil tps was higher in groundwater samples influenced by agriculture 515 ngl 1 than in groundwater samples pre classified as wastewater impacted 99 ngl 1 or in samples with only low anthropogenic influence 19 ngl 1 the phenols play a minor role for the drinking water quality since they exceeded 100 ngl 1 in only 3 of samples whereas the sulfonic acids r471811 sa r417888 sa and r419492 sa exceeded 100 ngl 1 in 52 14 and 14 of samples respectively the concentration ratios between the tps vary strongly from sample to sample si b1 for example tp r471811 sa was found at 2 50 times median 7 4 higher concentrations compared to its direct precursor compound tp r417888 sa these differences could be related to a different formation rate and or transport behavior the less polar tp r417888 sa is more affected by sorption than the more polar tp r471811 sa therefore in case of tp r417888 sa the degree of retardation during transport through the unsaturated zone might depend more strongly on the site specific soil sediment characteristics e g organic carbon than in the case of tp r471811 sa in addition more r417888 sa will be oxidized to r471811 sa with increasing residence time depending e g on size of soil sediment particles in the biologically more active aerobic top soil therefore we speculate that the concentration ratio between the tps r471811 sa and r417888 sa will increase with increasing organic carbon content and residence time in the unsaturated zone 3 2 abatement of chlorothalonil tps during drinking water treatment fig 2 provides an overview of the abatement by granular activated carbon filtration ozonation and uv disinfection in different waterworks while fig 3 illustrates the abatement of the three sulfonic acid tps along the treatment train of waterworks a and b phenolic tps were not detected waterworks c and d showed only very low concentrations of chlorothalonil tps in the raw water and were therefore not discussed in detail lake zurich and river limmat both 7 ngl 1 see si b2 for all quantitative data sand filtration and subsequent infiltration to the aquifer followed by abstraction did not lead to a decrease of the concentrations fig 3 left which is in accordance with the high mobility and persistence of the sulfonic acid tps efsa 2018 whereas the sulfonic acid tps were stable during ozonation and uv disinfection granular activated carbon filtration led to an abatement fig 3 however only very fresh activated carbon specific throughput 23 and 25 m3kg 1 waterworks a and b was capable of sufficiently abating all sulfonic acid tps r471811 sa 80 abatement r417888 sa r419492 sa below loq for slightly older activated carbon specific throughput 55 m3kg 1 waterworks a no retention of r471811 sa was observed whereas r419492 sa was still abated by 55 and r417888 sa was below loq an activated carbon filter with a specific throughput of 215 m3kg 1 waterworks b retained only the sulfonic acid tp with the highest water n octanol distribution coefficient considering the speciation at ph 7 log dow ph7 r417888 sa 58 abatement the oldest activated carbon filter specific throughput 305 m3kg 1 waterworks a had higher effluent than influent concentrations for all sulfonic acid tps indicating slight leaching from the filter the poor retention behaviour for r471811 sa was comparable to the breakthrough behaviour of the x ray contrast agent diatrizoic acid fig 2 whereas both compounds were still abated by 80 by fresh activated carbon specific throughput 25 m3kg 1 neither r471811 sa nor diatrizoic acid were abated by slightly older activated carbon specific throughput 55 and 305 m3kg 1 diatrizoic acid was not present in the raw water of waterworks b it should be noted that the results from the two waterworks a and b are in good agreement although different granular activated carbons were used waterworks a bituminous coal filtrasorb 400 calgon carbon corporation waterworks b bituminous coal hydraffin xc 30 donau carbon in intensively used agricultural areas managed aquifer recharge can decrease groundwater contamination with chlorothalonil tps by dilution because surface waters are usually less polluted with chlorothalonil tps section 3 1 three of the investigated groundwater abstraction wells were close to a river 40 730 m which was only slightly contaminated concentration sum of chlorothalonil tps 100 ngl 1 in a grab sample with increasing distance to the river the concentration sum of the chlorothalonil tps in the abstracted groundwater increased 2 abstraction wells 40 m from river 85 and 220 ngl 1 concentrations may differ due to a different pumping regime before sampling leading to different proportions of river water in the abstracted sample abstraction well 730 m from river 420 ngl 1 si b2 however managed aquifer recharge may introduce other organic micropollutants such as wastewater derived compounds hollender et al 2018 accordingly we observed higher concentrations of the sweetener acesulfame in abstraction wells close to the river compared to an abstraction well with larger distance to the river grab sample in river 280 ngl 1 2 abstraction wells 40 m from river 120 and 34 ngl 1 concentrations may differ due to a different pumping regime before sampling abstraction well 730 m from river 11 ngl 1 si b2 the phenolic tps were partly abated by uv disinfection with a large variability 57 43 fig 2 si b3 waterworks e and f no clear difference in abatement between the uv disinfection systems with low pressure hg lamps monochromatic uv light 254 nm or medium pressure hg lamps polychromatic uv light was observed fig 2 uv systems at waterworks are usually installed for disinfection requiring only low fluences i e 400 jm 2 according to german austrian and swiss legislation dvgw 2006 Ã¶norm 2001 svgw 2010 despite the low fluences abatement of some organic micropollutants has been reported scheurer et al 2014 observed 30 abatement of the sweetener acesulfame at a waterworks in basel switzerland and similar acesulfame abatement 30 50 fig 2 was observed at the uv disinfection systems in this study in addition to acesulfame we also observed partial abatement of diatrizoic acid 30 40 fig 2 in contrast uv disinfection did not affect the concentration of the sulfonic acid tps waterworks a fig 3 the slight abatement or formation observed at three other uv systems fig 2 likely reflects uncertainty from sampling and sample analysis it can be asked whether the investigated tps may also be formed in the waterworks from chlorothalonil or chlorothalonil tps chlorothalonil itself was not analysed in this study as it does not ionize sufficiently in electrospray however based on laboratory and lysimeter experiments performed within the eu pesticide registration process efsa 2018 and a german groundwater monitoring program lubw 2011 the presence of chlorothalonil in the raw waters in relevant concentrations is unlikely accordingly the water supplier operating waterworks b regularly checks for chlorothalonil in the raw water using gas chromatography electron ionization mass spectrometry but has never detected this compound loq 20 ngl 1 furthermore a formation of one target tp from another target tp was only observed in small amounts in the laboratory experiments i e 2 r471811 sa was formed from r417888 sa at ph 10 for each ozone dose including the control without ozone si a8 indicating very slow basic hydrolysis section 3 3 therefore we expect that the results of our study are not influenced by chlorothalonil tps formed in the waterworks 3 3 laboratory experiments table 1 provides the results from laboratory experiments with ozone uv and aops and corresponding literature data for common micropollutants for comparison si b4 to si b10 show the experimental data si a5 to si a10 describe the calculations of the reported values 3 3 1 uv irradiation in full scale water treatment the phenolic tps were partially abated by uv disinfection 57 43 whereas the sulfonic acid tps were persistent section 3 2 fig 2 the uvc irradiation experiments confirmed the higher photodegradability at 254 nm of the phenolic tps exhibiting higher photon fluence based rate constants table 1 the fast decay of the phenolic tps relates to their higher quantum yields compared to the sulfonic acid tps while all tps have moderate to high molar absorptivities table 1 fig si a1 and si a2 using the photon fluence based rate constants determined we calculated the theoretical abatement by uv disinfection si a5 assuming an applied uv dose of 400 jm 2 as prescribed in switzerland germany and austria dvgw 2006 Ã¶norm 2001 svgw 2010 theoretically 0 2 of the sulfonic acids and 2 5 of the phenols should be abated under such uv disinfection conditions table si a10 however abatement in full scale treatment fig 2 was higher compared to the estimates from uvc treatment alone this difference might be explained by indirect phototransformation due to production of reactive intermediates that can contribute to the removal of micropollutants i e reactions with radicals or triplet states generated by photoexcitation of dissolved organic matter or nitrate canonica et al 1995 mark et al 1996 zepp et al 1987 especially nitrate may play an important role because groundwater polluted with chlorothalonil tps often has elevated nitrate concentrations since both originate from mainly agricultural sources median of nitrate concentration in groundwater samples with phenolic tps 20 mgl 1 si b1 in contrast dissolved organic matter concentrations are usually low in groundwater doc in the 60 groundwater samples 2 1 mgl 1 indirect phototransformation is especially important for compounds susceptible to oxidation such as phenols canonica et al 2008 in addition to disinfection uv irradiation is used to generate oh in uv based aops the fluence applied in uv based aops 5000 10000 jm 2 chuang et al 2017 are about 10 25 times higher compared to uv disinfection so also direct phototransfomation can become relevant in case of the phenols an abatement of 24 for r611968 ph and 37 for syn507900 ph is estimated for a uv dose of 7500 jm 2 and the respective rate constants for 90 abatement of the phenolic tps by direct photolysis 38000 64000 jm 2 would be required for the sulfonic acid tps uv doses would need to be even ten times higher table si a10 3 3 2 ozonation in the ozonation step of waterworks b the sulfonic acid tps were not degraded section 3 2 this is in agreement with the very low second order rate constant for the reaction with ozone ko3 0 04 m 1s 1 table 1 only micropollutants with second order rate constants 10 m 1s 1 are significantly abated during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 e g acesulfame ko3 88 m 1s 1 table 1 was abated by 85 during ozonation waterworks b and c fig 2 the measured second order rate constants support our hypothesis that ozone only minimally reacts with the sulfonic acid tps because the benzene rings have six electron withdrawing substituents such as chlorine sulfonic acid cyano and or amide groups fig 1 ozone refractory compounds e g atrazine table 1 are mostly abated by oh that are formed from ozone decay and ozone reactions with dissolved organic matter as secondary oxidants von sonntag and von gunten 2012 however the sulfonic acid containing tps are also very refractory against oh koh 5 0 107 m 1s 1 table 1 explaining why no abatement was observed in waterworks b for these compounds in contrast the more electron rich phenolic tps are clearly more reactive as expected both with ozone and oh ko3 104 m 1s 1 table 1 to what extent the phenolic tps will be abated in full scale treatment cannot be concluded from the data presented here because the concentrations of the phenolic tps were loq in the raw water of waterworks b and c however hollender et al 2009 showed for a wastewater treatment plant with 5 2 0 6 mgl 1 doc and hydraulic retention times of 3 7 10 1 min in the ozone reactor that micropollutants with ko3 104 m 1s 1 are fully abated at ozone doses 0 4 g ozone g 1 doc therefore we assume that the phenols will be fully abated in waterworks b 0 8 g o3 g 1 doc contact time 10 min and c pre ozonation 0 3 g o3 g 1 doc contact time 25 min intermediate ozonation 0 6 g o3 g 1 doc contact time 10 min for phenolic compounds lee and von gunten 2012 developed quantitative structure activity relationships qsars based on substituent descriptors hammett constants to predict the second order rate constants for the reactions with ozone the proposed qsar was applied to predict the second order rate constants of r611968 ph and syn507900 ph and in addition of the phenolic tp which was not investigated in laboratory experiments syn548580 ph see si a7 the second order rate constants of r611968 ph and syn507900 ph predicted by qsar were on average 2 4 times higher than the measured values a factor 2 4 is within the uncertainty described by lee and von gunten 2012 the predicted second order rate constant of syn548580 ph was three to five times higher than the predicted second order rate constants of syn507900 ph and r611968 ph indicating higher abatement 3 3 3 advanced oxidation overall a broader range of micropollutants can be transformed in aops compared to ozonation because the oh generated in aops is a less selective oxidant von gunten 2018 moreover direct phototransformation by uv irradiation can contribute to micropollutant abatement depending on the aop applied e g uv h2o2 uv free chlorine katsoyiannis et al 2011 the second order rate constant for the reaction of r611968 ph with oh was 2 7 0 6 109 m 1s 1 which is similar to e g atrazine and many other micropollutants table 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for syn507900 ph the second order rate constant could not be determined because it was already reacting by direct photochemical reactions during uva irradiation and an enhancement of the decay rates could not be observed in uva h2o2 si a9 si b8 however because of their similar structures we assume that the second order rate constant for the reaction of syn507900 ph with oh is in the same range as for r611968 ph for a treatment plant with reverse osmosis followed by uv h2o2 marron et al 2019 calculated pollutant abatement depending on their second order rate constants for the reaction with oh whereby they assumed that the uv h2o2 reactor is designed to remove 1 4 dioxane by 70 through reactions with oh i e 4 10 10 ms oh exposure under these comparably favourable conditions low oh scavenging due to low doc 0 5 mgl 1 r611968 ph koh 2 7 0 6 109 m 1s 1 would be abated by 60 70 due to reaction with oh in contrast to the phenolic tps the abatement of the sulfonic acids koh 5 0 107 m 1s 1 is expected to be negligible in o3 h2o2 or uv h2o2 based on these low reactivities both with the rather unselective oxidant oh and the selective oxidant ozone it is likely that sulfonic acids are also persistent towards other oxidants such as hocl clo2 or sulfate radicals 3 3 4 activated carbon adsorption to powdered activated carbon was investigated in a natural groundwater doc 1 1 mgl 1 spiked with four chlorothalonil tps and for comparison with diatrizoic acid anionic at ph 7 predicted log dow ph7 0 6 and atrazine neutral at ph 7 predicted log dow ph7 2 2 two micropollutants with well known adsorption behaviour fig si a7 and si a8 show the abatement as a function of the powdered activated carbon dose according to this the affinity to activated carbon decreases in the following order atrazine r611968 ph r417888 sa syn507900 ph r4718111 sa diatrizoic acid the laboratory experiments showed a higher activated carbon affinity of r417888 sa compared to r471811 sa which was confirmed by the better retention of r417888 sa in the waterworks section 3 2 and is in accordance with the higher hydrophobicity fig 1 higher log dow ph7 however hydrophobicity is not the only parameter governing adsorption to activated carbon kovalova et al 2013b diatrizoic acid which has a predicted log dow ph7 comparable to r417888 sa showed similar adsorption behaviour to r471811 sa this was observed as well in full scale section 3 2 i e diatrizoic acid can be used in waterworks as predictor for the expected breakthrough of r471811 sa 3 3 5 reverse osmosis the reverse osmosis pilot plant was sampled five times over a period of fourteen weeks the corresponding results are summarized in si b10 chemical analyses focused on the two chlorothalonil tps with the highest concentrations r471811 sa r417888 sa two additional pesticide tps chloridazon desphenyl log dow ph7 0 8 chloridazon desphenyl methyl log dow ph7 0 6 and nitrate which are typical groundwater contaminants in many agricultural areas were also investigated the phenolic tps were completely removed not detectable in permeate i e 10 ng l raw water 30 100 ng l furthermore the chlorothalonil tp r417888 sa and chloridazon desphenyl methyl were not detectable in the permeate raw water 200 280 ngl 1 and 30 33 ngl 1 whereas the chlorothalonil tp r471811 sa was abated by 98 raw water 1200 2100 ngl 1 permeate 15 20 ngl 1 nitrate by 95 98 raw water 16 5 18 6 mgl 1 permeate 0 4 0 9 mgl 1 and the pesticide tp chloridazon desphenyl was only abated by 87 94 raw water 440 560 ngl 1 permeate 30 63 ngl 1 the lower removal of chloridazon desphenyl compared to the chlorothalonil tps may be related to differences in the molecular properties in contrast to the chlorothalonil tps chloridazon desphenyl is uncharged and has a smaller molecular mass and volume r471811 sa 348 gmol 1 23 nm3 chloridazon desphenyl 146 gmol 1 11 nm3 predicted by jchem for excel version 17 1 2300 1455 chemaxon ltd 3 4 practical implications the sulfonic acid tps are detected more frequently in drinking water resources than the phenolic tps and exhibit higher concentrations often exceeding the swiss drinking water standard of 100 ngl 1 chlorothalonil has recently been banned in the eu and in switzerland blw 2019a european commission 2019 so chlorothalonil will no longer be applied in large parts of europe however it is difficult to predict how long these tps will continue to be present in groundwater and for how long water suppliers will face raw water polluted with chlorothalonil tps the duration depends on various factors such as the exact dissipation time groundwater recharge rate groundwater residence time and dilution with other water sources in the respective aquifer experience from other pesticides with similar properties related to biodegradability and application periods and polar tps is scarce however studies in germany and switzerland showed no concentration decline for the tps of the herbicide chloridazon within five years after the last application in two shallow aquifers with average groundwater residence times 15 20 years hintze and hunkeler 2019 neukum and meyer 2019 model predictions are uncertain but indicate that a decrease in chloridazon tp concentration by 90 will take more than 20 years neukum and meyer 2019 both sampling along water treatment trains and laboratory experiments indicate that the sulfonic acid tps of chlorothalonil are persistent in most water treatment processes photochemical and oxidative processes uv irradiation ozonation and aops based on oh are not able to abate the sulfonic acid containing tps in contrast activated carbon may offer a chance to abate the sulfonic acid tps to a certain extent but efficiency varies strongly among tps to remove all chlorothalonil tps activated carbon needs to be exchanged or regenerated very frequently approximately as often as for the removal of the x ray contrast agent diatrizoic acid causing high economic and ecological costs reverse osmosis abated 98 of chlorothalonil tps however this is an energy intensive process and the reject water 20 30 of treated water needs to be treated or disposed efficient post treatment processes are not known and disposal to lakes and rivers is questionable because the pollutants are returned to the water cycle 4 conclusions chlorothalonil tps are widespread in drinking water resources one tp r471811 sa was detected in all 77 samples even in groundwater with low anthropogenic impact the sulfonic acid containing tps r471811 sa r419492 sa r417888 sa exceeded concentrations of 100 ngl 1 in 14 52 of the samples while the phenol containing tps syn507900 ph syn548580 ph r611968 ph were less frequently detected in 97 of samples the phenol containing tps were below concentrations of 100 ngl 1 although chlorothalonil has recently been banned in europe the tps of chlorothalonil are expected to challenge drinking water suppliers for many years due to their persistence in the environment and in water treatment processes the phenolic tps can be removed by various treatment techniques such as ozonation aops and activated carbon even uv disinfection may lead to a certain extent of removal in contrast to the phenolic tps the less electron rich sulfonic acids are more persistent and can be removed neither by ozonation nor by oh based aops under typical water treatment conditions the sulfonic acids adsorb to activated carbon to varying extents depending on their polarity for an efficient removal of the tp with the highest concentrations granular activated carbon needs to be exchanged more frequently than for other common micropollutants reverse osmosis was able to abate the chlorothalonil tps by 98 however the reject water needs to be disposed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
