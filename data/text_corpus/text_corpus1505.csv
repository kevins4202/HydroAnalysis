7525,hydrological consequences of alternative harvesting strategies in deciduous forest landscapes with seasonal snow cover have received relatively little attention most forest harvesting experiments in landscapes with seasonal snow cover have focused on clearcutting in coniferous forests few have examined alternative strategies such as selection or shelterwood cutting in deciduous stands whose hydrologic responses to harvesting may differ from those of conifers this study presents results from a 31 year examination of hydrological response to and recovery from alternative harvesting strategies in a deciduous forest landscape with seasonal snow cover in central ontario canada a quantitative means of assessing hydrologic recovery to harvesting is also developed clearcutting resulted in increased water year wy runoff this was accompanied by increased runoff in all seasons with greatest relative increases in summer direct runoff and baseflow from treatment catchments generally increased following harvesting although annual peak streamflow did not largest increases in wy runoff and seasonal runoff as well as direct runoff and baseflow generally occurred in the selection harvest catchment likely as a result of interception of hillslope runoff by a forest access road and redirection to the stream channel hydrologic recovery appeared to begin towards the end of the experimental period for several streamflow metrics but was incomplete for all harvesting strategies 15 years after harvesting geochemical tracing indicated that harvesting enhanced the relative importance of surface and near surface water pathways on catchment slopes for all treatments with the clearcut catchment showing the most pronounced and prolonged response such insights into water partitioning between flow pathways may assist assessments of the ecological and biogeochemical consequences of forest disturbance keywords forest harvesting clearcutting selection harvest shelterwood harvest streamflow hydrologic recovery direct runoff baseflow flow pathways turkey lakes watershed 1 introduction numerous paired catchment experiments have assessed streamflow response to forest harvesting see brown et al 2005 along with a more recent review by buttle 2011 increased streamflow following harvesting enhances the potential export of sediment nutrients and contaminants from the forest ecosystem therefore knowledge of the hydrologic consequences of forest harvesting assists understanding their implications for water quantity and quality as well as site productivity hornbeck et al 1993 schelker et al 2013 studies have often examined clearcutting bosch and hewlett 1982 stednick 1996 but few have studied hydrological responses to alternative silvicultural systems such as selection removal of single trees to create an uneven aged forest stand or shelterwood removal of the existing forest stand in a series of cuttings to promote regeneration in the harvested areas under shelter of the remaining stand to create an even aged forest harvesting most harvesting experiments in north america and elsewhere have also been in coniferous forests paired catchment studies in north america reported by bosch and hewlett 1982 and stednick 1996 supplemented by additional canadian work e g hetherington 1987 jewett et al 1995 swanson and rothwell 2001 buttle and metcalfe 2000 total 38 separate experiments of these 23 had conifer forest while 15 had in part or in total deciduous forest cover of the latter only 5 experiments had a significant 10 snowfall component of annual precipitation hubbard brook nh hornbeck et al 1997 martin et al 2000 marcell mn verry et al 1983 verry 1987 leading ridge pa hornbeck et al 1993 nashwaak nb jewett et al 1995 and streeter basin ab swanson and rothwell 2001 a similar situation exists in europe where a review of forest management impacts on peak flows and baseflows found only a single study of harvesting effects in a broadleaf forest landscape with seasonal snow cover robinson et al 2003 hydrologic consequences of forest harvesting in deciduous stands should be examined separately from those in coniferous forests since the latter may use water throughout the year provided temperatures and soil moisture are not limiting whereas transpiration from the former is largely restricted to the leaf on period jones and post 2004 harvesting of coniferous and deciduous stands may also differentially impact snow accumulation and melt jones and post 2004 which is particularly relevant in regions with seasonal snow cover resilience of runoff from deciduous forest ecosystems i e stable and or predictable annual runoff in the face of changing environmental conditions such as precipitation and evapotranspiration may also differ from that of coniferous forests carey et al 2010 creed et al 2014 this highlights the need to consider the distinct hydrologic response of deciduous forests to harvesting under changing climatic conditions sustainable management of deciduous forests with seasonal snow cover would benefit from knowledge of ecosystem response to various silvicultural systems and any subsequent hydrologic recovery hydrologic recovery is the restoration of hydrologic characteristics to near pre disturbance conditions via forest regeneration after either natural or anthropogenic disturbance hudson 2000 previous work has often been in temperate landscapes where forest regrowth rates and hydrologic recovery may be more rapid than in more northerly landscapes e g buttle et al 2005 thus further study of hydrologic recovery in deciduous forests in colder climates is needed research into hydrologic response to and recovery from harvesting in deciduous forests with seasonal snow cover should also consider changes in water flow paths which may be associated with shifts in the partitioning of precipitation between high and low flows as well as altered nutrient and contaminant fluxes from the catchment forest harvesting may increase the proportion of runoff reaching streams via rapid flow pathways such as saturation overland flow and near surface lateral flow e g caissie et al 2002 waterloo et al 2007 this would presumably accompany more net precipitation entering the soil following forest canopy removal enhanced soil wetness and expansion of surface saturated areas increased water recharge following forest harvesting could also augment groundwater discharge to streams buttle 2011 therefore assessment of the biogeochemical consequences of forest harvesting would benefit from information regarding any associated changes to water flow pathways this paper presents the results of a long term 31 year examination of hydrological response to a range of forest silvicultural systems in a deciduous forest landscape with seasonal snow cover we present a quantitative approach to assessing hydrologic recovery for these silvicultural systems and examine changes in water flow pathways following harvesting the paper s specific objectives are to 1 determine whether different silvicultural systems clearcut shelterwood and selection have produced significant changes in a range of catchment streamflow metrics 2 assess the degree of hydrologic recovery for each metric in the time since harvesting and 3 test the hypothesis that harvesting has increased the relative importance of surface and near surface flowpaths for water delivery to streams these objectives provide the structural subheadings used in the following sections 3 5 2 study site silvicultural treatments and experimental design 2 1 study site the study was conducted at the turkey lakes watershed tlw 47 03 n 84 25 w 60 km north of sault ste marie ontario fig 1 in the great lakes st lawrence forest region rowe 1972 of the boreal shield ecozone in the algoma region of central ontario the tlw has a total relief of 300 m mean daily air temperature at the tlw 1980 2010 is 4 6 c with mean daily january and july air temperatures of 10 7 and 17 9 c respectively semkin et al 2012 mean annual precipitation is 1189 mm semkin et al 2012 of which 35 falls as snow beall et al 2001 snow cover begins to develop in late october and melts during the march may period mean annual runoff in the tlw is 400 mm omnr 1984 regional bedrock is precambrian metamorphic basalt silicate greenstone with some granitic outcrops covered by thin discontinuous two component till bouldery silt loam ablation till overlying compacted sandy loam basal till hazlett et al 2001 hillslope soil cover is orthic humo ferric podzols spodosols with well defined l and f oi and oe horizons with a combined average thickness of 0 05 m hazlett et al 2001 while dispersed organic soils occupy depressions and riparian areas creed et al 2008 the tlw has a mature shade tolerant hardwood forest cover of sugar maple acer saccharum marsh 90 yellow birch betula alleghaniensis britton 9 and various conifers 1 jeffries et al 1988 the tlw is undisturbed with the exception of a light selective harvest high grading in the 1950s beall et al 2001 and the experimental harvest in 1997 that is the focus of this study 2 2 silvicultural treatments and streamflow measurements in the late summer and fall of 1997 catchments within the tlw were harvested using differing silvicultural systems followed by natural stand regeneration a before after control impact baci paired catchment approach was used to evaluate whether harvesting resulted in changes to catchment streamflow catchment characteristics for treatment and control catchments are given in table 1 control catchments were selected based on their similar size morphology and proximity relative to a given treatment catchment data on pre and post harvest stocking basal area and volume are given in table 2 mensuration data from c35 and c46 are not available however visual observations suggest forest cover in these catchments was similar to that in c32 catchment c31 was clearcut using a diameter limit cut in which all trees 20 cm diameter were felled de limbed and removed and all trees 10 20 cm diameter were felled and left on site catchment c33 was harvested using single tree selection an uneven aged system where mature and undesirable trees were removed a forest harvest access road ran parallel to the stream in c33 for about 750 m and runoff culverts were oriented toward the stream channel an even aged uniform shelterwood system was used in c34 where 50 of mature trees were harvested with residual trees providing a shelter this system requires a series of harvests for successful regeneration and stand development selection and shelterwood harvesting are accepted silvicultural systems used in shade tolerant hardwood forests in ontario omnrf 2015 clearcut harvesting was undertaken to maximize hydrological and biogeochemical disturbance experimentally rather than to simulate actual commercial harvesting monteith et al 2006 selection and shelterwood harvesting left 64 and 61 of the pre harvest overstory volume as live standing compared to 22 for the clearcut harvest table 2 sites were harvested by mechanical harvester and cable skidders trees were felled by a timberjack 2618 feller buncher limbs were removed on site and tree length stems were forwarded to roadside landings by rubber tired skidders riparian reserves were not used along the streams and logging occurred to stream sides however operators followed the riparian code of practice for ontario which prohibits machinery use and tree felling within 3 m of stream edges except at designated stream crossings other best management guidelines were followed such as keeping tree tops and limbs out of stream channels avoiding upland wet areas when possible and orienting skidder trails to avoid downslope channeling of runoff from disturbed areas streamflow from all catchments was obtained from stage discharge relationships developed using 90 v notch weirs stilling wells and stevens a 71 water level recorders beall et al 2001 weirs were installed down into the basal till to capture all flow from the catchments however there is the potential for some deep groundwater to bypass the weirs 2 3 hydroclimatic variables daily air temperature precipitation p and precipitation type were measured at the tlw meteorological station 4 km south of the catchments fig 1 ratios of wy snowfall to total p were determined and were supplemented by snow water equivalent swe surveys at the meteorological station data for estimating potential evapotranspiration pet using approaches such as the penman monteith or priestley taylor methods were not available for the entire period of record instead pet for the period of record was estimated using the temperature based hamon approach dingman 2002 meteorological data were available to estimate pet using the penman monteith method for 1997 2004 and there was good agreement between monthly pet estimated by the hamon and penman monteith methods for this period mean difference 8 16 mm maximum difference 46 mm minimum difference 0 mm thus the hamon method appears to provide reasonable estimates of pet for the tlw 3 methods 3 1 objective 1 assessing response of streamflow metrics to silvicultural systems 3 1 1 streamflow metrics results are reported using a june 1 may 31 water year wy since catchment soils at the start of the wy would be fully recharged by spring snowmelt hornbeck et al 1997 there were 16 wys of pre harvest mean daily streamflow data 1981 1996 and 15 wys of post harvest data 1997 2011 for all catchments with the exception of c46 which had 11 wys of post harvest data 1997 2007 streamflow was converted to equivalent runoff depth to standardize streamflows across catchments wy runoff seasonal runoff winter december january february spring march april may summer june july august fall september october november magnitude and date as day of year doy of maximum daily flow and number of days with zero flow were abstracted stream baseflow bf was separated from direct runoff dr by the one parameter digital filter method default filter parameter 0 925 using the web based hydrological analysis tool what lim et al 2005 baseflow maintains streamflow between periods of water input and is often equated to groundwater contributions to streamflow while dr is that portion of streamflow supplied by prompt delivery of rainfall and snowmelt to the stream dingman 2002 wy dr and bf depths were determined 3 1 2 temporal trends in hydroclimatic variables temporal trends in hydroclimatic variables were analyzed using mann kendall tests in r version 3 4 1 adjusted for temporal autocorrelation in the data matalas and langbein 1962 clarke et al 2011 trends significant at p 05 are reported 3 1 3 analysis of covariance the extra sum of squares analysis of covariance ancova approach moore and scott 2005 was used in r version 3 4 1 to assess whether a streamflow response to forest treatment had occurred a regression model model 1 was fit to the entire data set both pre and post harvesting periods 1 y β 0 β 1 x 1 ε where y the value of the streamflow metric for a given time for the treatment catchment and x 1 the corresponding value for the selected control catchment a second model was of the form 2 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 1 x 2 ε where x 2 is a dummy variable 0 during the pre harvesting period 1 in the post harvesting period this results in the following model for the post harvesting period 3 y β 0 β 2 β 1 β 3 x 1 ε the null hypothesis of no treatment effect is 4 h 0 β 2 β 3 0 a partial f test was used to determine if the fit of model 2 was significantly different p 05 level from that of model 1 i e that harvesting influenced the relationship between streamflow from the treatment and control catchments the significance p 05 level of the coefficient of the interaction term x1x2 i e β3 was also evaluated to determine whether the relationship between treatment and control had changed between the pre and post harvest periods the ancova approach was used when there was a statistically significant pre harvest relationship between a treatment and control catchment for a given streamflow metric this was generally the case for wy maximum daily flows and the number of days during each wy with zero flow however pre harvest relationships between treatment and control catchments for the other streamflow metrics were generally not statistically significant invalidating the use of ancova to assess the significance of streamflow response to treatment instead these metrics were analyzed using double mass curves 3 1 4 double mass curves double mass curves dmcs were used to assess temporal changes in streamflow from control and treatment catchments following treatment for wy runoff seasonal runoff and direct runoff and baseflow double mass curves are cumulative relationships between one variable e g catchment streamflow and another e g annual precipitation streamflow from a different catchment the dmc slope is generally determined using linear regression and a change in the proportionality between the two variables is reflected in a change in the slope of the trend of the plotted values dingman 2002 several recent studies e g wei and zhang 2010 yao et al 2012 have used this approach to assess streamflow response to changes in forest cover the statistical significance of slope changes in dmcs has been assessed using ancova e g searcy and hardison 1960 however the significant autocorrelation between successive cumulative values means that the data are not independent and thus conventional statistical tests of differences in slope may not be applicable dingman 2002 here we combine the dmc results with a randomization and resampling approach e g fleming and weber 2012 to estimate the statistical significance of any changes in the slope of the dmc following treatment 1 slopes of the dmc for the post and pre harvest periods were determined using linear regression and the ratio of the dmc slopes for the post and pre harvest periods was used as the test statistic the null hypothesis is that the dmc slope does not change following treatment i e slope ratio 1 2 the years of data were randomized and used to derive a new dmc 3 the new dmc was then divided into two segments based on the number of years of the pre and post harvest periods with the date of treatment 1997 as the breakpoint for the dmc 4 the ratio of the dmc slopes for the second and first periods was determined 5 steps 2 4 were repeated 10 000 times 6 the cumulative density function was determined using the values from step 4 and was used to determine the exceedance for ratios 1 or non exceedance probability for ratios 1 of the observed dmc slope ratio step 1 a program to conduct the randomization test presented above was written in r version 3 4 1 and a p 05 level was used was used to assess the significance of the observed dmc slope ratio double mass curves exhibiting significant changes in slope between pre and post harvest periods were used to estimate deviations of observed post harvest values of a given streamflow metric for the treatment catchment from predicted values for the treatment catchment predicted values were based on the regression relationship between treatment and control catchment values describing the pre harvest dmc 3 2 objective 2 assessing hydrologic recovery analysis of hydrologic recovery was based on differences between observed and predicted treatment streamflow metrics with the latter derived from the pre harvest calibration relationship between treatment and control catchments verry 1987 stednick 2008 hydrologic recovery was assumed to be demonstrated in two ways the first is when observed and predicted streamflow metric differences fall within the pre harvest range fig 2 a shows an example of where that is not the case however this is an insufficient measure of recovery since post harvest metric values within the pre harvest range could exhibit a systematic difference consistently greater or smaller relative to predictions from the calibration relationship fig 2b thus the second measure of hydrologic recovery is a return to the pattern of differences between observed and predicted treatment values of the streamflow metric observed during the pre harvest period with the number of positive differences generally balanced by the number of negative ones fig 2c several studies e g hornbeck et al 1993 1997 robinson and dupeyrat 2005 report a decrease in annual runoff to pre harvest values within 10 years of treatment suggesting that hydrologic recovery may be in the order of a decade in many forest landscapes in this study the range between the maximum positive and negative differences between observed and predicted treatment values for the pre harvest record for a given streamflow metric was determined and deviations beyond this range for the last five years of the post harvest record were noted the five year period represents 1 3 of the post harvest record for all catchments with the exception of c46 and was a compromise between having sufficient years with which to evaluate any hydrologic recovery while allowing enough years for any hydrologic recovery to begin to occur post harvest 10 years in the case of treatment control comparisons with c32 and c35 and 5 years with c46 the ratio of the number of positive and negative differences between observed and predicted treatment values for the pre harvest record for a given streamflow metric was determined and compared with the ratio of positive and negative differences between treatment and estimated control values for the last five years of the post harvest period hydrologic recovery was assumed if 1 all metric deviations during that period fell within the maximum range of deviations during the pre harvest period and 2 if the ratio of the number of positive and negative differences between observed and predicted treatment values for the last five years of the post harvest period fell within the range of ratios of the number of positive and negative deviations between observed and predicted metric values during the pre harvest period 3 3 objective 3 assessing response of water flowpaths to silvicultural systems two widely used geochemical tracers are potassium k and dissolved silica sio2 an inverse vertical zonation of these tracers occurs in tlw soils from the litter layer to the bedrock foster and nicolson 1988 hazlett et al 2001 with decreasing k with depth due to biological uptake and immobilization and increasing sio2 with depth due to greater weathering of the glacial till overlying regional bedrock thus aqueous molar ratios of k sio2 can help assess water flowpaths to the stream channel with large ratios denoting fast or surface near surface pathways and small ratios indicating slower and deeper subsurface pathways elsenbeer et al 1995 the number of samplers and duration of sampling for water at various depths in soil and glacial till are given in table 3 forest floor percolate ffp was sampled below the f oe horizon from plastic tension free lysimeters 0 15 0 3 m soil percolate sp was sampled at 0 3 m depth using porous cup suction lysimeters while groundwater gw samples were taken predominantly during spring snowmelt from drive point piezometers installed in the bouldery silt loam ablation till and underlying compacted sandy loam basal till hazlett et al 2001 that mantles the bedrock in c31 and c32 streamflow samples were collected at each catchment weir bi weekly except during spring snowmelt when samples were collected daily samples were analyzed for k by inductively coupled argon plasma icap emission spectrometry using a thermo jarrell ash model 1100 icap emission spectrometer and for sio2 by the ammonium molybdate method using a technicon autoanalyzer ii c by the water chemistry laboratory at the natural resources canada great lakes forestry centre in sault ste marie the hypothesized shift of hillslope runoff to surface and near surface flow pathways following harvesting was assessed through graphical comparison of times series of k sio2 molar ratios in catchment streamflow to those of ffp sp and shallow and deeper gw results were compared to temporal changes in the partitioning of catchment runoff between dr and bf section 3 1 1 4 results 4 1 forest regrowth following treatment characteristics of undisturbed forest stands were assumed to be represented by c32 this catchment saw a slight reduction in stocking relative to pre harvest conditions following treatment combined with increases in basal area and volume table 2 there were minor changes in basal area and volume in all treatment catchments by 15 years post harvest and values remained below pre harvest conditions stocking showed little change in c34 in c33 stocking returned to pre harvest values within 15 years of treatment the greatest change in stocking was in c31 increasing above pre harvest values 15 years following treatment 4 2 temporal trends in hydroclimatic variables the tlw region was generally warmer and drier in the post harvest period relative to pre harvest conditions precipitation at tlw declined significantly for the 1981 2011 period fig 3 a snowfall also decreased although there were no significant trends in the snowfall p ratio or maximum swe fig 3b mean annual air temperature mat increased at an average rate of 0 06 c wy 1 for the 1981 2011 period fig 3a mirrored by increasing pet fig 3c p pet indicates the amount of water potentially available to contribute to catchment streamflow and decreased between 1981 and 2011 fig 3c 4 3 objective 1 assessing response of streamflow metrics to silvicultural systems 4 3 1 ancova analyses 4 3 1 1 magnitude and timing of maximum daily runoff correlations between the magnitude of maximum daily runoff from treatment vs control catchments were generally weak during pre and post harvest periods data not shown there were no obvious changes in the post harvest relationship between treatment and control maximum daily runoff and no significant treatment effect found using ancova most daily runoff maxima for all catchments occurred during snowmelt doy 61 march 1 to doy 121 end of april during pre and post harvest periods fall maxima comprised as few as five of 31 c33 and as many as eight of 26 c46 daily runoff maxima there was generally good synchrony between the date of daily runoff maxima from treatment and control catchments before and after harvesting for c31 and c33 relative to c32 and c35 no more than five daily runoff maxima out of 31 maxima deviated by more than 50 days from the date of the runoff maximum for the control catchment the c34 vs c32 relationship was an exception where eight daily runoff maxima dates deviated by more than 50 days from the date of the control runoff maximum out of 26 maxima there were significant pre harvest calibration relationships for the doy of maximum runoff for all treatment control comparisons except c34 vs c32 and c34 vs c46 and ancova analyses showed no treatment effects on timing of daily runoff maxima 4 3 1 2 number of zero flow days several catchments had days with no streamflow zero flow days prior to harvest c31 735 days c32 1052 days c33 859 days c35 219 days c46 468 days conversely c34 had no pre harvest zero flow days ancova analyses showed no treatment effect for any harvested catchment 4 3 2 double mass curve analyses all regression relationships used to estimate dmc slopes for pre and post harvest periods were significant at the p 05 level 4 3 2 1 wy runoff vs wy precipitation all control catchments showed a gradual decline in wy runoff relative to wy p fig 4 a table 4 this decline preceded the date of harvesting and annual decreases in the amount of wy p translated into runoff were similar between controls post harvest in contrast there was no change in wy runoff relative to wy p for two of the treatment catchments c31 and c34 while one treatment catchment c33 saw a significant increase in wy runoff relative to wy p fig 4b table 4 thus the treatment catchments were more effective in translating annual precipitation into streamflow relative to the control catchments during the post harvest period 4 3 2 2 wy runoff treatment vs control catchments there was a significant increase in runoff from all treatment catchments relative to their controls fig 5 table 5 the average wy increase in runoff during the post harvest period was relatively similar between treatments and was greatest for c33 selection harvest and least for c34 shelterwood harvest the greatest increases in runoff from all treatment catchments did not immediately follow harvesting but instead occurred 6 or more years later fig 6 the largest increases in runoff were 479 mm 2003 wy for c31 vs c32 299 mm for c33 vs c32 2004 wy and 354 mm 2005 wy for c34 vs c32 4 3 2 3 seasonal runoff treatment vs control catchments there was a general increase in seasonal runoff from treatment relative to control catchments table 5 fig 7 with only two treatment control comparisons exhibiting no significant increase in runoff from the treatment c31 vs c32 winter c34 vs c32 spring the season with the largest average annual increases differed between treatments however all treatments saw the smallest runoff increases during summer the largest increase in winter runoff was from c34 relative to c46 224 mm in the 2005 wy 1 6 times mean pre harvest winter runoff for c34 the largest runoff increases in all other seasons were from c31 relative to c32 the greatest increase in spring runoff was 206 mm 2003 wy 0 66 of the mean pre harvest spring runoff for c31 while the greatest increase in fall runoff was 255 mm 2003 wy 1 37 times mean pre harvest spring runoff for c31 however the greatest proportional increase was in summer where the increase of 72 mm in the 1997 wy was twice the mean pre harvest summer runoff from c31 4 3 2 4 direct runoff and baseflow vs wy precipitation direct runoff and baseflow decreased relative to wy p between pre and post harvest periods for controls c32 and c46 fig 8 table 4 this consistent with decreased wy runoff from these catchments with most of the decline attributable to decreasing bf relative to wy p decreased wy runoff from c35 could be ascribed completely to declining bf relative to wy p there was also a differential response amongst the treatment catchments between pre and post harvest periods fig 8 table 4 only c33 showed an increase in both dr and bf relative to wy p in the post harvest period neither dr nor bf changed relative to wy p during the post harvest period for c31 while there was no change in dr and a decline in bf relative to wy p for c34 in the post harvest period 4 3 2 5 direct runoff and baseflow treatment vs control catchments all treatment catchments showed post harvest increases in dr and bf relative to the control catchments fig 9 table 6 this occurred despite the differential response in changes in dr and bf relative to wy p from treatment catchments in the post harvest period however the degree of increase differed depending on which control catchment was used in the dmc analysis this partly reflects the differential decrease in dr and bf relative to wy p between control catchments during the post harvest period noted above thus the largest increases in bf from treatment catchments were seen relative to c35 which showed the largest cumulative decrease in bf relative to wy p during the post harvest period of all control catchments table 4 as with wy runoff the largest annual increase in dr and bf occurred 6 or more years following harvesting fig 9 4 4 objective 2 assessing hydrologic recovery the maximum range in differences between the observed and predicted flow metric during the pre harvest period was defined for each treatment catchment and the first condition of hydrologic recovery was met when metric values during the last five years of the post harvest period all fell within that range ratios of the number of positive and negative deviations between pre harvest observed and predicted metric values ranged from 0 46 to 3 and the second condition of hydrologic recovery was met when the ratio during the last five years of the post harvest period fell within that range results are summarized in table 7 there were numerous instances when post harvest differences between observed and predicted metric values during the last five years of record fell within the pre harvest period range e g wy runoff from c31 vs both c32 and c35 fig 6 however many times these differences were consistently greater than 0 implying complete hydrologic recovery had not yet occurred while all treatment catchments had examples of hydrologic recovery for a given streamflow metric for a given treatment control comparison hydrologic recovery of that metric was generally not indicated when a different control catchment was used in the comparison the exception was c34 shelterwood which indicated hydrologic recovery of summer runoff and dr when compared with both c32 and c35 there was no evidence of hydrologic recovery of any streamflow metric for c34 when compared with c46 this likely reflects the shorter post harvest record for the latter control catchment 4 5 objective 3 assessing response of water flowpaths to silvicultural systems 4 5 1 forest floor percolate ffp and catchment streamflow concentrations of k and sio2 in ffp for control catchments were represented by values from the unharvested area between c31 and c32 k sio2 molar ratios in unharvested ffp showed no temporal trends and generally ranged between 0 1 and 10 fig 10 k sio2 in ffp from c31 overlapped ratios for the unharvested area between c31 and c32 particularly post harvest 1997 2000 streamflow k sio2 for the control catchments was also temporally stable and at the lower end of the range in ffp for the unharvested forest pre harvest streamflow k sio2 for treatment catchments was similar to control catchment values streamflow ratios for c31 increased in 1997 and peaked in 1998 ratios subsequently declined but remained above pre harvest values ratios in c33 and c34 streamflow rose beginning in 1997 with a more pronounced rise in c33 nevertheless this increase was less than that for c31 streamflow ratios for c33 and c34 returned to pre harvest values by 2011 4 5 2 soil percolate sp and catchment streamflow k sio2 in sp decreased following short lived 1 2 years increases that likely resulted from lysimeter installation and was generally less than in ffp fig 11 control catchment sp was represented by values from c32 and the unharvested area between c31 and c32 fig 11 and control catchment streamflow ratios were usually within the range of corresponding sp values k sio2 in sp for treatment catchments was similar to that from unharvested areas although peak values from the former generally exceeded those from the latter streamflow ratios from c31 plotted in the upper portion of the corresponding range in sp this occurred to a lesser extent for c33 and c34 4 5 3 ablation till and basal till groundwater gw and catchment streamflow k sio2 in gw in c32 tended to be less than in ffp but similar to sp ratios the range in k sio2 in ablation till exceeded that in basal till gw fig 12 and streamflow ratios for c32 were within the ablation and basal till gw range unlike c32 gw the range in k sio2 was similar between ablation till and basal till gw in c31 there was a short lived 1998 2000 post harvest increase in k sio2 in both ablation till and basal till gw with values returning to the pre harvest range by 2002 streamflow k sio2 in c31 tended to plot at the upper end of the range of ablation till and basal till gw 5 discussion 5 1 objective 1 assessing response of streamflow metrics to silvicultural systems 5 1 1 wy runoff runoff from all treatment catchments increased significantly following treatment compared to the control catchments maximum wy increases fig 6 were similar to values 80 300 mm from other experiments in landscapes with seasonal snow cover under deciduous e g verry 1987 brechtel and führer 1991 hornbeck et al 1993 1997 and coniferous forest cover e g robinson and dupeyrat 2005 ide et al 2013 however peak wy runoff occurred 6 or more years after harvesting at tlw unlike 1 3 years following treatment seen elsewhere e g verry 1987 hornbeck et al 1993 martin et al 2000 swanson and rothwell 2001 lags of 3 or more years between harvesting and peak annual runoff increase were also seen in coniferous stands in britain robinson and dupeyrat 2005 changes in annual runoff following harvesting tend to be greater in years with above normal precipitation stegman 1996 caissie et al 2002 and both p and maximum swe in 1997 were well below the post harvest average fig 3 this may account for the modest difference between observed and predicted runoff for the first year following harvesting for all treatment catchments runoff increases from c31 exceeded those from c34 table 5 consistent with the greater proportion of basin area harvested fig 1 and the greater reduction of basal area and volume table 2 in the former however the largest runoff increase was for c33 selection harvest this likely reflects diversion of hillslope runoff by the forest access road in c33 observed during snowmelt and large rainfalls and its routing through culverts towards the stream channel enhanced and prolonged water delivery to the stream by the access road was also indicated by elevated fine sediment deposition rates near the c33 weir for 5 years following harvest kreutzweiser and capell 2001 a similar effect was noted at hubbard brook new hampshire martin et al 2000 where protracted increased runoff from a catchment following whole tree harvesting was attributed to slow regeneration on skid trails our results indicate that road building can influence surface water runoff to a degree that largely overshadows the effect of canopy removal due to forest harvesting 5 1 2 direct runoff and baseflow results support increased dr from harvested catchments due to greater net p and wetter catchment soils as hypothesized by waterloo et al 2007 the range of increase in dr from c31 and c33 relative to their control catchments was similar table 6 this contrasts with the difference in harvesting intensity between these treatments and likely reflects the ability of the forest access road in c33 to enhance rapid delivery of hillslope runoff to the stream channel the smaller increase in dr from c34 relative to c31 is consistent with the smaller fraction of basin area harvested and smaller reductions of basal area and volume in the former however harvesting at tlw had the greatest impact on bf table 5 assuming that bf includes groundwater flow hendriks 2010 this supports the consensus that forest harvesting increases groundwater discharge to streams buttle 2011 relative to the controls as with dr c33 saw the greatest increases in bf which suggest the forest access road augmented bf by enhancing water delivery to the stream the role of the forest access road in increasing dr and bf and thus total runoff from c33 compared to the other treatments is supported by increases in dr and bf relative to wy p between pre and post harvest periods table 4 despite declining wy p wy snowfall and p pet fig 3 similar changes were not seen for c31 and c34 instead the latter saw a significant decrease in bf relative to wy p post harvest thus c33 became more effective in translating water inputs into dr and bf following treatment 5 1 3 seasonal runoff runoff increased from all treatment catchments relative to the controls in each season average annual increases in winter spring and fall were similar across treatments all of which showed the smallest increases in summer runoff increases in winter and spring runoff may reflect greater snow accumulation and snowmelt rates seen in harvested areas at tlw murray and buttle 2003 monteith et al 2006 and in other deciduous forests e g verry et al 1983 however the effect of harvesting on winter and spring runoff varied between wys during the post harvest period with some wys showing significant increases in runoff relative to the control catchments while others saw observed predicted treatment catchment runoff differences fall within the pre harvest range fig 7 this may reflect in part interannual variations in the specific drivers of snowmelt in any given wy e g radiative energy fluxes vs sensible and latent heat fluxes schelker et al 2013 increased summer runoff for all treatments is consistent with reduced canopy interception and transpiration following harvesting in deciduous forests e g verry 1987 hornbeck et al 1997 this in turn would likely have led to wetter soil conditions at the end of the summer in the treatment catchments which would account for increased runoff response to rainfall during the fall ide et al 2013 table 5 5 1 4 peak flows and zero flow days we found no treatment effects on either peak flows or number of zero flow days inability to detect significant changes in peak flows may partly result from our focus on maxima rather than a wider range of peak flows that could be matched between control and treatment catchments e g verry et al 1983 caissie et al 2002 a non significant change in post harvest peak flow is consistent with some experiments in deciduous forests e g hornbeck et al 1997 swanson and rothwell 2001 but contradicts verry et al s 1983 observation of earlier and increased snowmelt peak flows following aspen clearcutting in minnesota forest harvesting may desynchronize snowmelt timing from cleared relative to forested areas reducing peak flows from partially cut catchments verry et al 1983 hornbeck et al 1997 while this may account for the absence of increased peak flows from c33 and c34 it does not explain the failure of c31 to exhibit larger and earlier maximum flows this may instead be attributed to the smaller response of snow accumulation and melt to harvesting in deciduous relative to coniferous forests e g verry et al 1983 murray and buttle 2003 jones and post 2004 failure to detect reductions in the number of zero flow days was surprising given the increase in summer runoff and the widespread agreement that increased soil water and groundwater recharge generally accompanies forest canopy removal and enhances groundwater discharge to streams and thus low flows buttle 2011 5 2 objective 2 assessing hydrologic recovery definitive hydrologic recovery according to the recovery analyses and metrics we applied was not apparent for most streamflow metrics in the treatment catchments 15 years following harvesting table 7 several studies have indicated that forest harvesting effects on various aspects of catchment streamflow can persist well beyond 10 years e g jones and post 2004 moore and wondzell 2005 ide et al 2013 this contrasts with results from other deciduous paired catchment harvesting experiments annual runoff recovered within 14 15 years of aspen clearcutting in minnesota verry 1987 while runoff increases following harvesting in the northeastern us seldom persisted for more than 10 years hornbeck et al 1993 similarly streamflow returned to pre harvest values within 12 years of harvesting at the nashwaak site in new brunswick jewett et al 1995 in all these cases several years of elevated streamflow values were followed by declines to pre harvest conditions with forest regrowth this was not seen at tlw where increases in wy runoff seasonal runoff dr and bf persisted throughout the post harvest period figs 6 7 9 nevertheless some of the difference between results reported here and elsewhere may relate to the relatively stringent measure of hydrologic recovery used compared to previous work summer runoff in all treatment catchments fig 7 and dr in the selection and shelterwood harvest catchments fig 9 appear to be approaching pre harvest conditions 14 and 15 years following harvest these declines are consistent with greater interception from the expanding forest cover in the treatment catchments table 2 they also suggest that transpiration from the pioneer tree species occupying harvested areas such as yellow birch and red cherry may exceed that of mature forest at tlw such a mechanism has been suggested as an explanation of post harvest runoff decreases from hardwood forests at hubbard brook nh hornbeck et al 1993 5 3 objective 3 assessing response of water flowpaths to silvicultural systems we found evidence of greater partitioning of precipitation inputs to surface and near surface flow pathways in all treatment catchments relative to the controls decreases in k from ffp to basal till gw and increases in sio2 in the same direction facilitate using k sio2 molar ratios to assess changes in dominant water flowpaths following harvesting increased treatment catchment streamflow ratios above pre harvest values occurred without corresponding increases in ffp fig 10 and control catchment streamflow harvesting and increased organic matter decomposition did not increase k in water draining from the forest floor and the lack of control catchment response suggests that treatment catchment response could not be attributed to regional climate change instead increased post harvest streamflow k sio2 ratios likely resulted from a greater fraction of hillslope runoff acquiring k as it moved via surface and near surface pathways during transit through the catchment monteith et al 2006 used similar reasoning when comparing c31 and c32 for the 2001 snowmelt 4 years post harvest they found no significant inter catchment differences in terms of mean depth to water for ablation till piezometers and estimated that groundwater contributions to streamflow were greater during snowmelt for c32 relative to c31 thus despite increases in k sio2 in ablation till and basal till gw in c31 fig 12 they argued that larger k sio2 ratios in streamflow from c31 relative to c32 implied greater water flow via surface and near surface pathways following clearcutting the assertion that harvesting increased the fraction of hillslope runoff reaching the stream via surface and near surface pathways must be tempered by the relatively short period of groundwater data in c31 and particularly c32 as well as similar k sio2 ratios in streamflow relative to sp and gw in all cases treatment streamflow k sio2 overlapped sp values although c31 streamflow plotted at the upper end of the sp ranges similarly c31 streamflow k sio2 overlapped the upper portion of the corresponding ranges in both ablation till and basal till gw in c31 thus we cannot eliminate the possibility that some or all of the increased k reaching the stream in harvested catchments was supplied by water that acquired k as it infiltrated the forest floor recharged groundwater and subsequently moved to the stream via relatively deep flow pathways nevertheless greater streamflow k sio2 ratios following harvesting corresponds to increased dr from the treatment catchments relative to the controls table 6 and presumably enhanced k transfer to the stream the increase in dr was a much larger proportion of the overall increase in wy runoff in c31 compared to c33 and c34 this is consistent with greater streamflow k sio2 ratios in the former whereas the relatively larger bf contribution to increased runoff in the latter would likely have greater sio2 and thus lead to reduced streamflow k sio2 ratios for these catchments the muted response of c33 and c34 streamflow k sio2 ratios to harvesting compared to c31 also agrees with lower harvesting intensity in the former treatments elevated streamflow k sio2 ratios began to decline a few years following harvesting nevertheless increases above pre harvest values persisted to 2011 for c31 whereas values had returned to the pre harvest range in c33 and c34 by this time thus geochemical tracing provides a valuable metric of hydrologic recovery of runoff pathways which was most rapid for selection and shelterwood harvest but remained incomplete for clearcut harvest 6 conclusion this study examined the effects of three different silvicultural treatments clearcutting selection harvesting and shelterwood harvesting on a range of streamflow metrics and on water partitioning between near surface and subsurface water pathways in a deciduous forest landscape where seasonal snow cover plays a key hydrological role the major findings are 1 all treatments generally resulted in significant increases in wy runoff seasonal runoff direct runoff and baseflow relative to multiple control catchments maximum increases occurred 6 or more years after treatment likely due to below average precipitation in the treatment year largest increases generally occurred in the selection harvest catchment this was unexpected given reduced harvesting intensity in this catchment relative to the clearcut catchment and appears to have been the result of a forest access road that intercepted hillslope runoff and directed it to the stream channel smallest responses to harvesting generally occurred in the shelterwood harvesting catchment whose harvesting intensity was lower than in the clearcut catchment 2 there were no significant treatment effects on peak daily runoff or the number of days with zero flow the former is consistent with results from several studies examining harvesting impacts on streamflow in deciduous forests with seasonal snow cover however the latter is inconsistent with our observation of increased summer runoff and wy baseflow following harvesting and the consensus that forest harvesting generally increases groundwater discharge to streams 3 there was no conclusive evidence of hydrologic recovery within 15 years of harvesting for any of the treatments this was despite forest regeneration particularly in the clearcut catchment nevertheless hydrologic recovery appeared to begin towards the end of the experimental period for several streamflow metrics 4 geochemical tracing indicated harvesting enhanced water fluxes from treatment catchments via surface and near surface pathways relative to the controls this was consistent with general increases in direct runoff from treatment catchments following harvesting partitioning of hillslope runoff to surface and near surface pathways was most pronounced and prolonged in the clearcut catchment relative to the other treatments it is important to note that clearcutting is not a standard management practice in the shade tolerant hardwood

7525,hydrological consequences of alternative harvesting strategies in deciduous forest landscapes with seasonal snow cover have received relatively little attention most forest harvesting experiments in landscapes with seasonal snow cover have focused on clearcutting in coniferous forests few have examined alternative strategies such as selection or shelterwood cutting in deciduous stands whose hydrologic responses to harvesting may differ from those of conifers this study presents results from a 31 year examination of hydrological response to and recovery from alternative harvesting strategies in a deciduous forest landscape with seasonal snow cover in central ontario canada a quantitative means of assessing hydrologic recovery to harvesting is also developed clearcutting resulted in increased water year wy runoff this was accompanied by increased runoff in all seasons with greatest relative increases in summer direct runoff and baseflow from treatment catchments generally increased following harvesting although annual peak streamflow did not largest increases in wy runoff and seasonal runoff as well as direct runoff and baseflow generally occurred in the selection harvest catchment likely as a result of interception of hillslope runoff by a forest access road and redirection to the stream channel hydrologic recovery appeared to begin towards the end of the experimental period for several streamflow metrics but was incomplete for all harvesting strategies 15 years after harvesting geochemical tracing indicated that harvesting enhanced the relative importance of surface and near surface water pathways on catchment slopes for all treatments with the clearcut catchment showing the most pronounced and prolonged response such insights into water partitioning between flow pathways may assist assessments of the ecological and biogeochemical consequences of forest disturbance keywords forest harvesting clearcutting selection harvest shelterwood harvest streamflow hydrologic recovery direct runoff baseflow flow pathways turkey lakes watershed 1 introduction numerous paired catchment experiments have assessed streamflow response to forest harvesting see brown et al 2005 along with a more recent review by buttle 2011 increased streamflow following harvesting enhances the potential export of sediment nutrients and contaminants from the forest ecosystem therefore knowledge of the hydrologic consequences of forest harvesting assists understanding their implications for water quantity and quality as well as site productivity hornbeck et al 1993 schelker et al 2013 studies have often examined clearcutting bosch and hewlett 1982 stednick 1996 but few have studied hydrological responses to alternative silvicultural systems such as selection removal of single trees to create an uneven aged forest stand or shelterwood removal of the existing forest stand in a series of cuttings to promote regeneration in the harvested areas under shelter of the remaining stand to create an even aged forest harvesting most harvesting experiments in north america and elsewhere have also been in coniferous forests paired catchment studies in north america reported by bosch and hewlett 1982 and stednick 1996 supplemented by additional canadian work e g hetherington 1987 jewett et al 1995 swanson and rothwell 2001 buttle and metcalfe 2000

swanson and rothwell 2001 a similar situation exists in europe where a review of forest management impacts on peak flows and baseflows found only a single study of harvesting effects in a broadleaf forest landscape with seasonal snow cover robinson et al 2003 hydrologic consequences of forest harvesting in deciduous stands should be examined separately from those in coniferous forests since the latter may use water throughout the year provided temperatures and soil moisture are not limiting whereas transpiration from the former is largely restricted to the leaf on period jones and post 2004 harvesting of coniferous and deciduous stands may also differentially impact snow accumulation and melt jones and post 2004 which is particularly relevant in regions with seasonal snow cover resilience of runoff from deciduous forest ecosystems i e stable and or predictable annual runoff in the face of changing environmental conditions such as precipitation and evapotranspiration may also differ from that of coniferous forests carey et al 2010 creed et al 2014 this highlights the need to consider the distinct hydrologic response of deciduous forests to harvesting under changing climatic conditions sustainable management of deciduous forests with seasonal snow cover would benefit from knowledge of ecosystem response to various silvicultural systems and any subsequent hydrologic recovery hydrologic recovery is the restoration of hydrologic characteristics to near pre disturbance conditions via forest regeneration after either natural or anthropogenic disturbance hudson 2000 previous work has often been in temperate landscapes where forest regrowth rates and hydrologic recovery may be more rapid than in more northerly landscapes e g buttle et al 2005 thus further study of hydrologic recovery in deciduous forests in colder climates is needed research into hydrologic response to and recovery from harvesting in deciduous forests with seasonal snow cover should also consider changes in water flow paths which may be associated with shifts in the partitioning of precipitation between high and low flows as well as altered nutrient and contaminant fluxes from the catchment forest harvesting may increase the proportion of runoff reaching streams via rapid flow pathways such as saturation overland flow and near surface lateral flow e g caissie et al 2002 waterloo et al 2007 this would presumably accompany more net precipitation entering the soil following forest canopy removal enhanced soil wetness and expansion of surface saturated areas increased water recharge following forest harvesting could also augment groundwater discharge to streams buttle 2011 therefore assessment of the biogeochemical consequences of forest harvesting would benefit from information regarding any associated changes to water flow pathways this paper presents the results of a long term 31 year examination of hydrological response to a range of forest silvicultural systems in a deciduous forest landscape with seasonal snow cover we present a quantitative approach to assessing hydrologic recovery for these silvicultural systems and examine changes in water flow pathways following harvesting the paper s specific objectives are to 1 determine whether different silvicultural systems clearcut shelterwood and selection have produced significant changes in a range of catchment streamflow metrics 2 assess the degree of hydrologic recovery for each metric in the time since harvesting and 3 test the hypothesis that harvesting has increased the relative importance of surface and near surface flowpaths for water delivery to streams these objectives provide the structural subheadings used in the following sections 3 5 2 study site

cover is orthic humo ferric podzols spodosols with well defined l and f oi and oe horizons with a combined average thickness of 0 05 m hazlett et al 2001 while dispersed organic soils occupy depressions and riparian areas creed et al 2008 the tlw has a mature shade tolerant hardwood forest cover of sugar maple acer saccharum marsh 90 yellow birch betula alleghaniensis britton 9 and various conifers 1 jeffries et al 1988 the tlw is undisturbed with the exception of a light selective harvest high grading in the 1950s beall et al 2001 and the experimental harvest in 1997 that is the focus of this study 2 2 silvicultural treatments and streamflow measurements in the late summer and fall of 1997 catchments within the tlw were harvested using differing silvicultural systems followed by natural stand regeneration a before after control impact baci paired catchment approach was used to evaluate whether harvesting resulted in changes to catchment streamflow catchment characteristics for treatment and control catchments are given in table 1 control catchments were selected based on their similar size morphology and proximity relative to a given treatment catchment data on pre and post harvest stocking basal area and volume are given in table 2 mensuration data from c35 and c46 are not available however visual observations suggest forest cover in these catchments was similar to that in c32 catchment c31 was clearcut using a diameter limit cut in which all trees 20 cm diameter were felled de limbed and removed and all trees 10 20 cm diameter were felled and left on site catchment c33 was harvested using single tree selection an uneven aged system where mature and undesirable trees were removed a forest harvest access road ran parallel to the stream in c33 for about 750 m and runoff culverts were oriented toward the stream channel an even aged uniform shelterwood system was used in c34 where 50 of mature trees were harvested with residual trees providing a shelter this system requires a series of harvests for successful regeneration and stand development selection and shelterwood harvesting are accepted silvicultural systems used in shade tolerant hardwood forests in ontario omnrf 2015 clearcut harvesting was undertaken to maximize hydrological and biogeochemical disturbance experimentally rather than to simulate actual commercial harvesting monteith et al 2006 selection and shelterwood harvesting left 64 and 61 of the pre harvest overstory volume as live standing compared to 22 for the clearcut harvest table 2 sites were harvested by mechanical harvester and cable skidders trees were felled by a timberjack 2618 feller buncher limbs were removed on site and tree length stems were forwarded to roadside landings by rubber tired skidders riparian reserves were not used along the streams and logging occurred to stream sides however operators followed the riparian code of practice for ontario which prohibits machinery use and tree felling within 3 m of stream edges except at designated stream crossings other best management guidelines were followed such as keeping tree tops and limbs out of stream channels avoiding upland wet areas when possible and orienting skidder trails to avoid downslope channeling of runoff from disturbed areas streamflow from all catchments was obtained from stage discharge relationships developed using 90 v notch weirs stilling wells and stevens a 71 water level recorders beall et al 2001 weirs were installed down into the basal till to capture all flow from the catchments however there is the potential for some deep groundwater to bypass the weirs 2 3 hydroclimatic variables daily air temperature precipitation p and precipitation type were measured at the tlw meteorological station 4 km south of the catchments fig 1 ratios of wy snowfall to total p were determined and were supplemented by snow water equivalent swe surveys at the meteorological station data for estimating potential evapotranspiration pet using approaches such as the penman monteith or priestley taylor methods were not available for the entire period of record instead pet for the period of record was estimated using the temperature based hamon approach dingman 2002 meteorological data were available to estimate pet using the penman monteith method for 1997 2004 and there was good agreement between monthly pet estimated by the hamon and penman monteith methods for this period mean difference 8 16 mm maximum difference 46 mm minimum difference 0 mm thus the hamon method appears to provide reasonable estimates of pet for the tlw 3 methods 3 1 objective 1 assessing response of streamflow metrics to silvicultural systems 3 1 1 streamflow metrics results are reported using a june 1 may 31 water year wy since catchment soils at the start of the wy would be fully recharged by spring snowmelt hornbeck et al 1997 there were 16 wys of pre harvest mean daily streamflow data 1981 1996 and 15 wys of post harvest data 1997 2011 for all catchments with the exception of c46 which had 11 wys of post harvest data 1997 2007 streamflow was converted to equivalent runoff depth to standardize streamflows across catchments wy runoff seasonal runoff winter december january february spring march april may summer june july august fall september october november magnitude and date as day of year doy of maximum daily flow and number of days with zero flow were abstracted stream baseflow bf was separated from direct runoff dr by the one parameter digital filter method default filter parameter 0 925 using the web based hydrological analysis tool what lim et al 2005 baseflow maintains streamflow between periods of water input and is often equated to groundwater contributions to streamflow while dr is that portion of streamflow supplied by prompt delivery of rainfall and snowmelt to the stream dingman 2002 wy dr and bf depths were determined 3 1 2 temporal trends in hydroclimatic variables temporal trends in hydroclimatic variables were analyzed using mann kendall tests in r version 3 4 1 adjusted for temporal autocorrelation in the data matalas and langbein 1962 clarke et al 2011 trends significant at p 05 are reported 3 1 3 analysis of covariance the extra sum of squares analysis of covariance ancova approach moore and scott 2005 was used in r version 3 4 1 to assess whether a streamflow response to forest treatment had occurred a regression model model 1 was fit to the entire data set both pre and post harvesting periods 1 y β 0 β 1 x 1 ε where y the value of the streamflow metric for a given time for the treatment catchment and x 1 the corresponding value for the selected control catchment a second model was of the form 2 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 1 x 2 ε where x 2 is a dummy variable 0 during the pre harvesting period 1 in the post harvesting period this results in the following model for the post harvesting period 3 y β 0 β 2 β 1 β 3 x 1 ε the null hypothesis of no treatment effect is 4 h 0 β 2 β 3 0 a partial f test was used to determine if the fit of model 2 was significantly different p 05 level from that of model 1 i e that harvesting influenced the relationship between streamflow from the treatment and control catchments the significance p 05 level of the coefficient of the interaction term x1x2 i e β3 was also evaluated to determine whether the relationship between treatment and control had changed between the pre and post harvest periods the ancova approach was used when there was a statistically significant pre harvest relationship between a treatment and control catchment for a given streamflow metric this was generally the case for wy maximum daily flows and the number of days during each wy with zero flow however pre harvest relationships between treatment and control catchments for the other streamflow metrics were generally not statistically significant invalidating the use of ancova to assess the significance of streamflow response to treatment instead these metrics were analyzed using double mass curves 3 1 4 double mass curves double mass curves dmcs were used to assess temporal changes in streamflow from control and treatment catchments following treatment for wy runoff seasonal runoff and direct runoff and baseflow double mass curves are cumulative relationships between one variable e g catchment streamflow and another e g annual precipitation streamflow from a different catchment the dmc slope is generally determined using linear regression and a change in the proportionality between the two variables is reflected in a change in the slope of the trend of the plotted values dingman 2002 several recent studies e g wei and zhang 2010 yao et al 2012 have used this approach to assess streamflow response to changes in forest cover the statistical significance of slope changes in dmcs has been assessed using ancova e g searcy and hardison 1960 however the significant autocorrelation between successive cumulative values means that the data are not independent and thus conventional statistical tests of differences in slope may not be applicable dingman 2002 here we combine the dmc results with a randomization and resampling approach e g fleming and weber 2012 to estimate the statistical significance of any changes in the slope of the dmc following treatment 1 slopes of the dmc for the post and pre harvest periods were determined using linear regression and the ratio of the dmc slopes for the post and pre harvest periods was used as the test statistic the null hypothesis is that the dmc slope does not change following treatment i e slope ratio 1 2 the years of data were randomized and used to derive a new dmc 3 the new dmc was then divided into two segments based on the number of years of the pre and post harvest periods with the date of treatment 1997 as the breakpoint for the dmc 4 the ratio of the dmc slopes for the second and first periods was determined 5 steps 2 4 were repeated 10 000 times 6 the cumulative density function was determined using the values from step 4 and was used to determine the exceedance for ratios 1 or non exceedance probability for ratios 1 of the observed dmc slope ratio step 1 a program to conduct the randomization test presented above was written in r version 3 4 1 and a p 05 level was used was used to assess the significance of the observed dmc slope ratio double mass curves exhibiting significant changes in slope between pre and post harvest periods were used to estimate deviations of observed post harvest values of a given streamflow metric for the treatment catchment from predicted values for the treatment catchment predicted values were based on the regression relationship between treatment and control catchment values describing the pre harvest dmc 3 2 objective 2 assessing hydrologic recovery analysis of hydrologic recovery was based on differences between observed and predicted treatment streamflow metrics with the latter derived from the pre harvest calibration relationship between treatment and control catchments verry 1987 stednick 2008 hydrologic recovery was assumed to be demonstrated in two ways the first is when observed and predicted streamflow metric differences fall within the pre harvest range fig 2 a shows an example of where that is not the case however this is an insufficient measure of recovery since post harvest metric values within the pre harvest range could exhibit a systematic difference consistently greater or smaller relative to predictions from the calibration relationship fig 2b thus the second measure of hydrologic recovery is a return to the pattern of differences between observed and predicted treatment values of the streamflow metric observed during the pre harvest period with the number of positive differences generally balanced by the number of negative ones fig 2c several studies e g hornbeck et al 1993 1997 robinson and dupeyrat 2005 report a decrease in annual runoff to pre harvest values within 10 years of treatment suggesting that hydrologic recovery may be in the order of a decade in many forest landscapes in this study the range between the maximum positive and negative differences between observed and predicted treatment values for the pre harvest record for a given streamflow metric was determined and deviations beyond this range for the last five years of the post harvest record were noted the five year period represents 1 3 of the post harvest record for all catchments with the exception of c46 and was a compromise between having sufficient years with which to evaluate any hydrologic recovery while allowing enough years for any hydrologic recovery to begin to occur post harvest 10 years in the case of treatment control comparisons with c32 and c35 and 5 years with c46 the ratio of the number of positive and negative differences between observed and predicted treatment values for the pre harvest record for a given streamflow metric was determined and compared with the ratio of positive and negative differences between treatment and estimated control values for the last five years of the post harvest period hydrologic recovery was assumed if 1 all metric deviations during that period fell within the maximum range of deviations during the pre harvest period and 2 if the ratio of the number of positive and negative differences between observed and predicted treatment values for the last five years of the post harvest period fell within the range of ratios of the number of positive and negative deviations between observed and predicted metric values during the pre harvest period 3 3 objective 3 assessing response of water flowpaths to silvicultural systems two widely used geochemical tracers are potassium k and dissolved silica sio2 an inverse vertical zonation of these tracers occurs in tlw soils from the litter layer to the bedrock foster and nicolson 1988 hazlett et al 2001 with decreasing k with depth due to biological uptake and immobilization and increasing sio2 with depth due to greater weathering of the glacial till overlying regional bedrock thus aqueous molar ratios of k sio2 can help assess water flowpaths to the stream channel with large ratios denoting fast or surface near surface pathways and small ratios indicating slower and deeper subsurface pathways elsenbeer et al 1995 the number of samplers and duration of sampling for water at various depths in soil and glacial till are given in table 3 forest floor percolate ffp was sampled below the f oe horizon from plastic tension free lysimeters 0 15 0 3 m soil percolate sp was sampled at 0 3 m depth using porous cup suction lysimeters while groundwater gw samples were taken predominantly during spring snowmelt from drive point piezometers installed in the bouldery silt loam ablation till and underlying compacted sandy loam basal till hazlett et al 2001 that mantles the bedrock in c31 and c32 streamflow samples were collected at each catchment weir bi weekly except during spring snowmelt when samples were collected daily samples were analyzed for k by inductively coupled argon plasma icap emission spectrometry using a thermo jarrell ash model 1100 icap emission spectrometer and for sio2 by the ammonium molybdate method using a technicon autoanalyzer ii c by the water chemistry laboratory at the natural resources canada great lakes forestry centre in sault ste marie the hypothesized shift of hillslope runoff to surface and near surface flow pathways following harvesting was assessed through graphical comparison of times series of k sio2 molar ratios in catchment streamflow to those of ffp sp and shallow and deeper gw results were compared to temporal changes in the partitioning of catchment runoff between dr and bf section 3 1 1 4 results 4 1 forest regrowth following treatment characteristics of undisturbed forest stands were assumed to be represented by c32 this catchment saw a slight reduction in stocking relative to pre harvest conditions following treatment combined with increases in basal area and volume table 2 there were minor changes in basal area and volume in all treatment catchments by 15 years post harvest and values remained below pre harvest conditions stocking showed little change in c34 in c33 stocking returned to pre harvest values within 15 years of treatment the greatest change in stocking was in c31 increasing above pre harvest values 15 years following treatment 4 2 temporal trends in hydroclimatic variables the tlw region was generally warmer and drier in the post harvest period relative to pre harvest conditions precipitation at tlw declined significantly for the 1981

2011 fig 3c 4 3 objective 1 assessing response of streamflow metrics to silvicultural systems 4 3 1 ancova analyses 4 3 1 1 magnitude and timing of maximum daily runoff correlations between the magnitude of maximum daily runoff from treatment vs control catchments were generally weak during pre and post harvest periods data not shown there were no obvious changes in the post harvest relationship between treatment and control maximum daily runoff and no significant treatment effect found using ancova most daily runoff maxima for all catchments occurred during snowmelt doy 61 march 1 to doy 121 end of april during pre and post harvest periods fall maxima comprised as few as five of 31 c33 and as many as eight of 26 c46 daily runoff maxima there was generally good synchrony between the date of daily runoff maxima from treatment and control catchments before and after harvesting for c31 and c33 relative to c32 and c35 no more than five daily runoff maxima out of 31 maxima deviated by more than 50 days from the date of the runoff maximum for the control catchment the c34 vs c32 relationship was an exception where eight daily runoff maxima dates deviated by more than 50 days from the date of the control runoff maximum out of 26 maxima there were significant pre harvest calibration relationships for the doy of maximum runoff for all treatment control comparisons except c34 vs c32 and c34 vs c46 and ancova analyses showed no treatment effects on timing of daily runoff maxima 4 3 1 2 number of zero flow days several catchments had days with no streamflow zero flow days prior to harvest c31 735 days c32 1052 days c33 859 days c35 219 days c46 468 days conversely c34 had no pre harvest zero flow days ancova analyses showed no treatment effect for any harvested catchment 4 3 2 double mass curve analyses all regression relationships used to estimate dmc slopes for pre and post harvest periods were significant at the p 05 level 4 3 2 1 wy runoff vs wy precipitation all control catchments showed a gradual decline in wy runoff relative to wy p fig 4 a table 4 this decline preceded the date of harvesting and annual decreases in the amount of wy p translated into runoff were similar between controls post harvest in contrast there was no change in wy runoff relative to wy p for two of the treatment catchments c31 and c34 while one treatment catchment c33 saw a significant increase in wy runoff relative to wy p fig 4b table 4 thus the treatment catchments were more effective in translating annual precipitation into streamflow relative to the control catchments during the post harvest period 4 3 2 2 wy runoff treatment vs control catchments there was a significant increase in runoff from all treatment catchments relative to their controls fig 5 table 5 the average wy increase in runoff during the post harvest period was relatively similar between treatments and was greatest for c33 selection harvest and least for c34 shelterwood harvest the greatest increases in runoff from all treatment catchments did not immediately follow harvesting but instead occurred 6 or more years later fig 6 the largest increases in runoff were 479 mm 2003 wy for c31 vs c32 299 mm for c33 vs c32 2004 wy and 354 mm 2005 wy for c34 vs c32 4 3 2 3 seasonal runoff treatment vs control catchments there was a general increase in seasonal runoff from treatment relative to control catchments table 5 fig 7 with only two treatment control comparisons exhibiting no significant increase in runoff from the treatment c31 vs c32 winter c34 vs c32 spring the season with the largest average annual increases differed between treatments however all treatments saw the smallest runoff increases during summer the largest increase in winter runoff was from c34 relative to c46 224 mm in the 2005 wy 1 6 times mean pre harvest winter runoff for c34 the largest runoff increases in all other seasons were from c31 relative to c32 the greatest increase in spring runoff was 206 mm 2003 wy 0 66 of the mean pre harvest spring runoff for c31 while the greatest increase in fall runoff was 255 mm 2003 wy 1 37 times mean pre harvest spring runoff for c31 however the greatest proportional increase was in summer where the increase of 72 mm in the 1997 wy was twice the mean pre harvest summer runoff from c31 4 3 2 4 direct runoff and baseflow vs wy precipitation direct runoff and baseflow decreased relative to wy p between pre and post harvest periods for controls c32 and c46 fig 8 table 4 this consistent with decreased wy runoff from these catchments with most of the decline attributable to decreasing bf relative to wy p decreased wy runoff from c35 could be ascribed completely to declining bf relative to wy p there was also a differential response amongst the treatment catchments between pre and post harvest periods fig 8 table 4 only c33 showed an increase in both dr and bf relative to wy p in the post harvest period neither dr nor bf changed relative to wy p during the post harvest period for c31 while there was no change in dr and a decline in bf relative to wy p for c34 in the post harvest period 4 3 2 5 direct runoff and baseflow treatment vs control catchments all treatment catchments showed post harvest increases in dr and bf relative to the control catchments fig 9 table 6 this occurred despite the differential response in changes in dr and bf relative to wy p from treatment catchments in the post harvest period however the degree of increase differed depending on which control catchment was used in the dmc analysis this partly reflects the differential decrease in dr and bf relative to wy p between control catchments during the post harvest period noted above thus the largest increases in bf from treatment catchments were seen relative to c35 which showed the largest cumulative decrease in bf relative to wy p during the post harvest period of all control catchments table 4 as with wy runoff the largest annual increase in dr and bf occurred 6 or more years following harvesting fig 9 4 4 objective 2 assessing hydrologic recovery the maximum range in differences between the observed and predicted flow metric during the pre harvest period was defined for each treatment catchment and the first condition of hydrologic recovery was met when metric values during the last five years of the post harvest period all fell within that range ratios of the number of positive and negative deviations between pre harvest observed and predicted metric values ranged from 0 46 to 3 and the second condition of hydrologic recovery was met when the ratio during the last five years of the post harvest period fell within that range results are summarized in table 7 there were numerous instances when post harvest differences between observed and predicted metric values during the last five years of record fell within the pre harvest period range e g wy runoff from c31 vs both c32 and c35 fig 6 however many times these differences were consistently greater than 0 implying complete hydrologic recovery had not yet occurred while all treatment catchments had examples of hydrologic recovery for a given streamflow metric for a given treatment control comparison hydrologic recovery of that metric was generally not indicated when a different control catchment was used in the comparison the exception was c34 shelterwood which indicated hydrologic recovery of summer runoff and dr when compared with both c32 and c35 there was no evidence of hydrologic recovery of any streamflow metric for c34 when compared with c46 this likely reflects the shorter post harvest record for the latter control catchment 4 5 objective 3 assessing response of water flowpaths to silvicultural systems 4 5 1 forest floor percolate ffp and catchment streamflow concentrations of k and sio2 in ffp for control catchments were represented by values from the unharvested area between c31 and c32 k sio2 molar ratios in unharvested ffp showed no temporal trends and generally ranged between 0 1 and 10 fig 10 k sio2 in ffp from c31 overlapped ratios for the unharvested area between c31 and c32 particularly post harvest 1997 2000 streamflow k sio2 for the control catchments was also temporally stable and at the lower end of the range in ffp for the unharvested forest pre harvest streamflow k sio2 for treatment catchments was similar to control catchment values streamflow ratios for c31 increased in 1997 and peaked in 1998 ratios subsequently declined but remained above pre harvest values ratios in c33 and c34 streamflow rose beginning in 1997 with a more pronounced rise in c33 nevertheless this increase was less than that for c31 streamflow ratios for c33 and c34 returned to pre harvest values by 2011 4 5 2 soil percolate sp and catchment streamflow k sio2 in sp decreased following short lived 1 2 years increases that likely resulted from lysimeter installation and was generally less than in ffp fig 11 control catchment sp was represented by values from c32 and the unharvested area between c31 and c32 fig 11 and control catchment streamflow ratios were usually within the range of corresponding sp values k sio2 in sp for treatment catchments was similar to that from unharvested areas although peak values from the former generally exceeded those from the latter streamflow ratios from c31 plotted in the upper portion of the corresponding range in sp this occurred to a lesser extent for c33 and c34 4 5 3 ablation till and basal till groundwater gw and catchment streamflow k sio2 in gw in c32 tended to be less than in ffp but similar to sp ratios the range in k sio2 in ablation till exceeded that in basal till gw fig 12 and streamflow ratios for c32 were within the ablation and basal till gw range unlike c32 gw the range in k sio2 was similar between ablation till and basal till gw in c31 there was a short lived 1998 2000 post harvest increase in k sio2 in both ablation till and basal till gw with values returning to the pre harvest range by 2002 streamflow k sio2 in c31 tended to plot at the upper end of the range of ablation till and basal till gw 5 discussion 5 1 objective 1 assessing response of streamflow metrics to silvicultural systems 5 1 1 wy runoff runoff from all treatment catchments increased significantly following treatment compared to the control catchments maximum wy increases fig 6 were similar to values 80 300 mm from other experiments in landscapes with seasonal snow cover under deciduous e g verry 1987 brechtel and führer 1991 hornbeck et al 1993 1997 and coniferous forest cover e g robinson and dupeyrat 2005 ide et al 2013 however peak wy runoff occurred 6 or more years after harvesting at tlw unlike 1 3 years following treatment seen elsewhere e g verry 1987 hornbeck et al 1993 martin et al 2000 swanson and rothwell 2001 lags of 3 or more years between harvesting and peak annual runoff increase were also seen in coniferous stands in britain robinson and dupeyrat 2005 changes in annual runoff following harvesting tend to be greater in years with above normal precipitation stegman 1996 caissie et al 2002 and both p and maximum swe in 1997 were well below the post harvest average fig 3 this may account for the modest difference between observed and predicted runoff for the first year following harvesting for all treatment catchments runoff increases from c31 exceeded those from c34 table 5 consistent with the greater proportion of basin area harvested fig 1 and the greater reduction of basal area and volume table 2 in the former however the largest runoff increase was for c33 selection harvest this likely reflects diversion of hillslope runoff by the forest access road in c33 observed during snowmelt and large rainfalls and its routing through culverts towards the stream channel enhanced and prolonged water delivery to the stream by the access road was also indicated by elevated fine sediment deposition rates near the c33 weir for 5 years following harvest kreutzweiser and capell 2001 a similar effect was noted at hubbard brook new hampshire martin et al 2000 where protracted increased runoff from a catchment following whole tree harvesting was attributed to slow regeneration on skid trails our results indicate that road building can influence surface water runoff to a degree that largely overshadows the effect of canopy removal due to forest harvesting 5 1 2 direct runoff and baseflow results support increased dr from harvested catchments due to greater net p and wetter catchment soils as hypothesized by waterloo et al 2007 the range of increase in dr from c31 and c33 relative to their control catchments was similar table 6 this contrasts with the difference in harvesting intensity between these treatments and likely reflects the ability of the forest access road in c33 to enhance rapid delivery of hillslope runoff to the stream channel the smaller increase in dr from c34 relative to c31 is consistent with the smaller fraction of basin area harvested and smaller reductions of basal area and volume in the former however harvesting at tlw had the greatest impact on bf table 5 assuming that bf includes groundwater flow hendriks 2010 this supports the consensus that forest harvesting increases groundwater discharge to streams buttle 2011 relative to the controls as with dr c33 saw the greatest increases in bf which suggest the forest access road augmented bf by enhancing water delivery to the stream the role of the forest access road in increasing dr and bf and thus total runoff from c33 compared to the other treatments is supported by increases in dr and bf relative to wy p between pre and post harvest periods table 4 despite declining wy p wy snowfall and p pet fig 3 similar changes were not seen for c31 and c34 instead the latter saw a significant decrease in bf relative to wy p post harvest thus c33 became more effective in translating water inputs into dr and bf following treatment 5 1 3 seasonal runoff runoff increased from all treatment catchments relative to the controls in each season average annual increases in winter spring and fall were similar across treatments all of which showed the smallest increases in summer runoff increases in winter and spring runoff may reflect greater snow accumulation and snowmelt rates seen in harvested areas at tlw murray and buttle 2003 monteith et al 2006 and in other deciduous forests e g verry et al 1983 however the effect of harvesting on winter and spring runoff varied between wys during the post harvest period with some wys showing significant increases in runoff relative to the control catchments while others saw observed predicted treatment catchment runoff differences fall within the pre harvest range fig 7 this may reflect in part interannual variations in the specific drivers of snowmelt in any given wy e g radiative energy fluxes vs sensible and latent heat fluxes schelker et al 2013 increased summer runoff for all treatments is consistent with reduced canopy interception and transpiration following harvesting in deciduous forests e g verry 1987 hornbeck et al 1997 this in turn would likely have led to wetter soil conditions at the end of the summer in the treatment catchments which would account for increased runoff response to rainfall during the fall ide et al 2013 table 5 5 1 4 peak flows and zero flow days we found no treatment effects on either peak flows or number of zero flow days inability to detect significant changes in peak flows may partly result from our focus on maxima rather than a wider range of peak flows that could be matched between control and treatment catchments e g verry et al 1983 caissie et al 2002 a non significant change in post harvest peak flow is consistent with some experiments in deciduous forests e g hornbeck et al 1997 swanson and rothwell 2001 but contradicts verry et al s 1983 observation of earlier and increased snowmelt peak flows following aspen clearcutting in minnesota forest harvesting may desynchronize snowmelt timing from cleared relative to forested areas reducing peak flows from partially cut catchments verry et al 1983 hornbeck et al 1997 while this may account for the absence of increased peak flows from c33 and c34 it does not explain the failure of c31 to exhibit larger and earlier maximum flows this may instead be attributed to the smaller response of snow accumulation and melt to harvesting in deciduous relative to coniferous forests e g verry et al 1983 murray and buttle 2003 jones and post 2004 failure to detect reductions in the number of zero flow days was surprising given the increase in summer runoff and the widespread agreement that increased soil water and groundwater recharge generally accompanies forest canopy removal and enhances groundwater discharge to streams and thus low flows buttle 2011 5 2 objective 2 assessing hydrologic recovery definitive hydrologic recovery according to the recovery analyses and metrics we applied was not apparent for most streamflow metrics in the treatment catchments 15 years following harvesting table 7 several studies have indicated that forest harvesting effects on various aspects of catchment streamflow can persist well beyond 10 years e g jones and post 2004 moore and wondzell 2005 ide et al 2013 this contrasts with results from other deciduous paired catchment harvesting experiments annual runoff recovered within 14 15 years of aspen clearcutting in minnesota verry 1987 while runoff increases following harvesting in the northeastern us seldom persisted for more than 10 years hornbeck et al 1993 similarly streamflow returned to pre harvest values within 12 years of harvesting at the nashwaak site in new brunswick jewett et al 1995 in all these cases several years of elevated streamflow values were followed by declines to pre harvest conditions with forest regrowth this was not seen at tlw where increases in wy runoff seasonal runoff dr and bf persisted throughout the post harvest period figs 6 7 9 nevertheless some of the difference between results reported here and elsewhere may relate to the relatively stringent measure of hydrologic recovery used compared to previous work summer runoff in all treatment catchments fig 7 and dr in the selection and shelterwood harvest catchments fig 9 appear to be approaching pre harvest conditions 14 and 15 years following harvest these declines are consistent with greater interception from the expanding forest cover in the treatment catchments table 2 they also suggest that transpiration from the pioneer tree species occupying harvested areas such as yellow birch and red cherry may exceed that of mature forest at tlw such a mechanism has been suggested as an explanation of post harvest runoff decreases from hardwood forests at hubbard brook nh hornbeck et al 1993 5 3 objective 3 assessing response of water flowpaths to silvicultural systems we found evidence of greater partitioning of precipitation inputs to surface and near surface flow pathways in all treatment catchments relative to the controls decreases in k from ffp to basal till gw and increases in sio2 in the same direction facilitate using k sio2 molar ratios to assess changes in dominant water flowpaths following harvesting increased treatment catchment streamflow ratios above pre harvest values occurred without corresponding increases in ffp fig 10 and control catchment streamflow harvesting and increased organic matter decomposition did not increase k in water draining from the forest floor and the lack of control catchment response suggests that treatment catchment response could not be attributed to regional climate change instead increased post harvest streamflow k sio2 ratios likely resulted from a greater fraction of hillslope runoff acquiring k as it moved via surface and near surface pathways during transit through the catchment monteith et al 2006 used similar reasoning when comparing c31 and c32 for the 2001 snowmelt 4 years post harvest they found no significant inter catchment differences in terms of mean depth to water for ablation till piezometers and estimated that groundwater contributions to streamflow were greater during snowmelt for c32 relative to c31 thus despite increases in k sio2 in ablation till and basal till gw in c31 fig 12 they argued that larger k sio2 ratios in streamflow from c31 relative to c32 implied greater water flow via surface and near surface pathways following clearcutting the assertion that harvesting increased the fraction of hillslope runoff reaching the stream via surface and near surface pathways must be tempered by the relatively short period of groundwater data in c31 and particularly c32 as well as similar k sio2 ratios in streamflow relative to sp and gw in all cases treatment streamflow k sio2 overlapped sp values although c31 streamflow plotted at the upper end of the sp ranges similarly c31 streamflow k sio2 overlapped the upper portion of the corresponding ranges in both ablation till and basal till gw in c31 thus we cannot eliminate the possibility that some or all of the increased k reaching the stream in harvested catchments was supplied by water that acquired k as it infiltrated the forest floor recharged groundwater and subsequently moved to the stream via relatively deep flow pathways nevertheless greater streamflow k sio2 ratios following harvesting corresponds to increased dr from the treatment catchments relative to the controls table 6 and presumably enhanced k transfer to the stream the increase in dr was a much larger proportion of the overall increase in wy runoff in c31 compared to c33 and c34 this is consistent with greater streamflow k sio2 ratios in the former whereas the relatively larger bf contribution to increased runoff in the latter would likely have greater sio2 and thus lead to reduced streamflow k sio2 ratios for these catchments the muted response of c33 and c34 streamflow k sio2 ratios to harvesting compared to c31 also agrees with lower harvesting intensity in the former treatments elevated streamflow k sio2 ratios began to decline a few years following harvesting nevertheless increases above pre harvest values persisted to 2011 for c31 whereas values had returned to the pre harvest range in c33 and c34 by this time thus geochemical tracing provides a valuable metric of hydrologic recovery of runoff pathways which was most rapid for selection and shelterwood harvest but remained incomplete for clearcut harvest 6 conclusion this study examined the effects of three different silvicultural treatments clearcutting selection harvesting and shelterwood harvesting on a range of streamflow metrics and on water partitioning between near surface and subsurface water pathways in a deciduous forest landscape where seasonal snow cover plays a key hydrological role the major findings are 1 all treatments generally resulted in significant increases in wy runoff seasonal runoff direct runoff and baseflow relative to multiple control catchments maximum increases occurred 6 or more years after treatment likely due to below average precipitation in the treatment year largest increases generally occurred in the selection harvest catchment this was unexpected given reduced harvesting intensity in this catchment relative to the clearcut catchment and appears to have been the result of a forest access road that intercepted hillslope runoff and directed it to the stream channel smallest responses to harvesting generally occurred in the shelterwood harvesting catchment whose harvesting intensity was lower than in the clearcut catchment 2 there were no significant treatment effects on peak daily runoff or the number of days with zero flow the former is consistent with results from several studies examining harvesting impacts on streamflow in deciduous forests with seasonal snow cover however the latter is inconsistent with our observation of increased summer runoff and wy baseflow following harvesting and the consensus that forest harvesting generally increases groundwater discharge to streams 3 there was no conclusive evidence of hydrologic recovery within 15 years of harvesting for any of the treatments this was despite forest regeneration particularly in the clearcut catchment nevertheless hydrologic recovery appeared to begin towards the end of the experimental period for several streamflow metrics 4 geochemical tracing indicated harvesting enhanced water fluxes from treatment catchments via surface and near surface pathways relative to the controls this was consistent with general increases in direct runoff from treatment catchments following harvesting partitioning of hillslope runoff to surface and near surface pathways was most pronounced and prolonged in the clearcut catchment relative to the other treatments it is important to note that clearcutting is not a standard management practice in the shade tolerant hardwood forests studied at tlw nevertheless insights into water partitioning between flow pathways can assist in assessing the ecological and biogeochemical consequences of forest disturbance acknowledgements

7526,bayesian inference using markov chain monte carlo mcmc provides an explicit framework for stochastic calibration of hydrogeologic models accounting for uncertainties however the mcmc sampling entails a large number of model calls and could easily become computationally unwieldy if the high fidelity hydrogeologic model simulation is time consuming this study proposes a surrogate based bayesian framework to address this notorious issue and illustrates the methodology by inverse modeling a regional modflow model the high fidelity groundwater model is approximated by a fast statistical model using bagging multivariate adaptive regression spline bmars algorithm and hence the mcmc sampling can be efficiently performed in this study the modflow model is developed to simulate the groundwater flow in an arid region of oman consisting of mountain coast aquifers and used to run representative simulations to generate training dataset for bmars model construction a bmars based sobol method is also employed to efficiently calculate input parameter sensitivities which are used to evaluate and rank their importance for the groundwater flow model system according to sensitivity analysis insensitive parameters are screened out of bayesian inversion of the modflow model further saving computing efforts the posterior probability distribution of input parameters is efficiently inferred from the prescribed prior distribution using observed head data demonstrating that the presented bmars based bayesian framework is an efficient tool to reduce parameter uncertainties of a groundwater system keywords modflow bayesian inverse modeling surrogate bagging mars 1 introduction numerical simulation of a groundwater flow system requires knowledge of hydrologic characteristics of the aquifers such as hydraulic conductivity and specific storage of hydrogeologic units complete knowledge of these properties are usually very hard to obtain in the subsurface and the incurred uncertainty will reduce the predictive capability of the groundwater model and impair the reliability of groundwater resources management based on model predictions to improve the model accuracy and reduce uncertainties many inverse modeling methods have been developed to estimate hydrologic parameters by matching modeled results to corresponding field measurements e g carrera 1988 dai and samper 2004 carrera et al 2005 hill and tiedeman 2007 tonkin and doherty 2009 sadeghi tabas et al 2016 shang et al 2016 whereas applications of these methods are usually limited by considerable number of forward model simulations required during inverse modeling wagner 1995 jordan et al 2015 owing to the insufficient knowledge of the aquifers considerable uncertainties might be introduced into groundwater modeling systems yielding ill posed inverse problems with non unique solutions de marsily et al 1999 to cope with this issue bayesian inference has been studied and applied extensively as an effective inverse framework yielding a parameter posterior probability distribution instead of a deterministic solution from its prior distribution oliver et al 1997 kavetski et al 2006 fu and gomez hernandez 2009 tarantola 2004 the analytical solutions of posterior distribution are usually very difficult to obtain in bayesian inversion khaleghi et al 2013 instead markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods provide a practical tool to draw samples from the specified target distribution to numerically approximate posterior distributions for groundwater model parameters hassan et al 2009 efendiev et al 2011 laloy et al 2013 however when dealing with large scale high fidelity groundwater models mcmc methods may become computationally burdensome because of the considerable number of uncertain parameters to be estimated and many times of repeated forward model calls for posterior distribution to reach convergence smith and marshall 2008 there are

sobol 1993 for highly efficient global sa of modflow model parameters according to importance ranking the insensitive parameters are thus identified and excluded from bayesian inversion without losing key physical characteristics of the original model the dimension of inverse modeling is reduced and computing efforts are focused on the most important parameters the presentation of the study is

followed by detailed description of core components 2 1 bmars based bayesian inversion framework the proposed inversion framework proceeds as follows fig 1 1 m input parameters are chosen with uncertainties defined by their distributions and ranges which are representative of prior knowledge of the groundwater flow system in this study the parameters are hydrogeologic characteristics of the aquifers including hydraulic conductivity specific storage and specific yield 2 n input m vectors are sampled from their prior probability density functions pdf using latin hypercube l h method mckay et al 1979 these n realizations are used to generate input files to run n modflow model simulations and their corresponding responses in our case below heads at observation wells are obtained 3 the n input vector response pairs shaded in fig 1 are used to train and cross validate bmars surrogate model leave one out cross validation loocv approach is used for surrogate model validation picard and cook 1984 4 the importance of the input parameters of the modflow model is ranked according to sobol total order sensitivity indices sobol 1993 which is efficiently computed using cheap bmars model only top sensitive parameters are considered influential to the hydrogeologic system and included in bayesian inversion 5 the bmars model is utilized in place of the modflow model within a bayesian inversion scheme from which posterior distributions of the sensitive parameters are inferred by comparisons with observed head data the posterior pdfs represent a subset of the prior data that yield indeterminate solutions with highest probabilities the bmars driven bayesian inference framework is programmed in python script by coupling modflow model with various algorithms mentioned above i e l h sampling bmars approximation loocv sobol method and bayesian inference the suite of modflow simulations are distributed to and executed on high performance computing facility at sultan qaboos university in oman 2 2 modflow model in modflow the groundwater mass balance equation governing transient groundwater flow is written as bear 1972 1 x kx h x y ky h y z kz h z ss h t w where t is the

input parameter vector k and c i are the number and coefficients of associated basis functions ji is the interaction order of basis function i e the number of input parameters included in the basis function s ji 1 is the sign indicators v j i is the index of the parameter x which is split on knots tji detailed description of mars can be found in friedman 1991 bmars model is the bootstrap expectation of mars models and usually approximated by monte carlo method below breiman 1996 3 f bmars 1 b b 1 b f b x where f b x is the mars model and b is defined as the instantiation number of mars model for monte carlo approximation 2 4 sobol sensitivity indices the sobol method is a variance based global sensitivity calculation approach the variance of response y is decomposed into fractions which are attributed to each input parameter 1st order indices and their interactions 2nd and higher order indices the sobol sensitivity indices si can be calculated as follows sobol 2001 4 si i var e y x i var y 5 si ij var e y x i x j var e y x i var e y x j var y 6 si ti si i j i si ij j i k j si ijk where si i si ij si ijk and si ti are the 1st 2nd 3rd and total order indices of input parameter x i respectively sobol total order sensitivity measures the contribution of each input parameter to the uncertainty of output y including all variances caused by its interactions with any other parameters in all the orders traditional sobol method calculates output response y using physical model f x and usually is very time consuming in our surrogate based sobol method bmars model f bmars is used in place of modflow model f x to achieve fast estimation of sobol total order sensitivity indices 2 5 bmars based bayesian inversion bayesian inversion aims to reduce parameter uncertainty by integrating prior information in form of prior pdf and the observations through the inference of the posterior pdf according to bayes theorem posterior distribution p x y can be expressed as 7 p x y p y x p x p y where x is the parameter vector to be inversed y is the observations p x is the parameter prior probability p y is the marginal distribution and usually a normalized constant and p y x is the likelihood function which measure the fitness between predictions and observations the errors between simulated and observed head is calculated as 8 ε y f x where f x is the predictions from groundwater flow models the errors ε is usually assumed to follow multivariate normal distribution with covariance matrix c resulting in gaussian likelihood function defined as zeng et al 2012 9 p y x exp ε t c 1 ε 2 2 π n 2 c 1 2 where c is the determinant of c and n is the number of observations in this study bmars surrogate model f bmars is used as an approximation of physical modflow model f x to evaluate p y x as a result the posterior probability distribution p x y can be calculated without executing expensive modflow models during mcmc sampling and thus significantly improves bayesian inversion efficiency 3 al fara regional groundwater flow model to illustrate the proposed framework methodology a hydrogeologic system consisting of mountain hardrock and coastal alluvium in al fara area of oman is chosen as the test case due to available data and knowledge from the extensive studies of this region amerjeed 2016 3 1 study area the study area wadi al fara catchment covers a 1172 km2 area extending from 522 700 to 570 700 e in longitude and from 2 559 400 to 2 633 900 n in latitude in north oman as shown in fig 2 a it originates from the northwest slopes of the mountain towards northern coastal plain for about 70 km to the sea the average winter temperatures range between 20 and 28 c in the study area while it may reach over 40 c in summer the average annual rainfall is between 73 and 270 mm year from coastal to mountain zone while the potential evapotranspiration may reach 2300 mm year in this area ground surface elevations drop rapidly from a maximum of 3000 m at the southern mountain to 100 m at the base of the piedmont and then to sea level at the coast fig 2b the mountainous zone generally lacks vegetation with little soil coverage wadi beds and their banks are inhabited with limited agriculture developed on terraces irrigated by aflaj originating from springs the coastal plain is made up of relatively uniform alluvial sediments and is the most extensive agricultural regions irrigated by groundwater 3 2 geologic model digital elevation model obtained from nasa shuttle radar topography mission and stratigraphy data from 57 borehole logs in the target area geo resources consultants 2006 are used to build the 3d geological model fig 3 as shown in fig 2b the geological structure consists of six primary hydrostratigraphic units that is hajar super group ophiolite wadi alluvium plain alluvium upper fars and lower fars hajar super group comprises carbonate rocks and dolomite siltstones and sandstones it is highly heterogeneous fractured and karstified as the upper mountain zone its surface covers 340 km2 and receives most of the rainfall in the target area ophiolite is characterized as fracture aquifer covered by wadi alluvium in valleys this middle valley zone covers about 350 km2 of area the plain alluvium is deposited as vari coloured sand interbedded with cemented and silty gravels it covers the total coastal plain an area of 480 km2 and serves as the most important aquifer in the study area beneath the plain alluvium is the upper fars which comprised dolomites limestone with interbeds of thin siltstones towards the base and it is the second important aquifer of al fara area the underlying lower fars produces little water and mainly serves as the impermeable bedrock it is characterized by mudstone claystone variably cemented gravels and calcareous shale 3 3 numerical model based upon the geological model the model domain is discretized into 150 rows 97 columns and 6 layers in modflow every layer consists of 14 550 cells whose area is 500 m by 500 m each cells that fall out of the model boundary are flagged as inactive in model simulations and removed from fig 4 the model is bounded by groundwater divide along the mountain ridge as the no flow southern boundary and the coast of the oman sea as the northern boundary with specified zero constant head previous studies show that the general groundwater flow is from the south highland to the north coast plain hence eastern and western boundaries are assumed parallel with groundwater flow direction and no flow the bottom layer is treated no flow boundary as impermeable bedrock time variant recharge estimated from rainfall evapotranspiration abstraction is specified on the top layer as shown in fig 5 hajor super group ophiolite wadi alluvium and plain alluvium are distributed from southern mountain area to the coast plain on the top layer head measurements are obtained from the 15 observations wells located in the target area as green solid circles shown in fig 5 alluvium material including both wadi and plain alluvium units disappear on the underlying layers impermeable low fars occurs from layer 3 indicating the layer 1 and 2 are the main flow path for groundwater from mountains to the coast fig 6 owing to the data availability the model simulates the groundwater flow in the target area over 20 years from january 1993 to september 2013 with 248 monthly stress periods totally the initial head data for the model are obtained from the measurements in january 1993 using empirical bayesian kriging interpolation method izady et al 2017 3 4 modflow simulations in the proposed method bmars models are constructed using a training dataset which is composed of sample inputs and associated responses from modflow simulations considering parameter uncertainties the scenarios of these simulations should represent various conditions of the physical system as complete as possible in this case the uncertainties are represented by range and distribution of key properties of five hydrogeologic units that is hydraulic conductivity specific storage and specific yield resulting in 15 uncertain parameters totally note that the 6th unit lower fars is considered impermeable bedrock and its properties are given fixed values as presented in table 1 the ranges of the 15 parameters account for our best knowledge about al fara groundwater flow system and expected to be improved by numerical method of bayesian inversion using monthly head measurements from 15 observation wells following the procedure in fig 1 the 15 uncertain parameters as a vector are sampled 1000 times within their ranges using l h method yielding 1000 modflow models the log transformed hydraulic conductivity and the other two properties are assumed to follow uniform random distribution in their ranges the outputs of the 1000 model simulations along with the corresponding input sample values form the training dataset for bmars model development as illustrated as gray area of fig 1 4 results and discussions 4 1 bmars model development during the bagging process 100 mars models b 100 in eq 3 are instantiated to approximate the bmars model and each mars model is developed by 100 basis functions and 8 variables k 100 ji 8 in eq 2 a well fitted bmars model does not necessarily mean good predictive ability due to over fitting and model validation is required for quality control the cross validation of bmars models in this study is conducted by loocv method which can use the existing training dataset without requiring additional test dataset picard and cook 1984 the quality of the bmars models is examined by scatter plots comparing true data from modflow model and predicted data by bmars model fig 7 gives an example for head output at well rq 1 see fig 5 for location at the last simulation stress to examine how bmars model approximates modflow model the 1000 points associated with predicted head values from bmars are plotted against true data from 1000 modflow simulations the well fitted bmars model fitting r 2 0 9954 show excellent predictive performance validation r 2 0 9976 during model cross validation the scaled root mean square errors rmse for fitting and validating bmars model are 0 01298 and 0 02165 respectively suggesting a remarkable goodness of fit of surrogate with physical models standard deviations for each head prediction by bmars model are also calculated based on the associated 100 instantiations of mars models in fig 7b only those heads whose true value from modflow falls outside the range one standard deviation of the predicted values from bmars are plotted with error bar for a clear display as a result none of those error bars intersect with the diagonal in the fig 7b 4 2 sensitivity analysis as discussed in introduction section sensitivity analysis provides a useful tool to identify the key properties that control the groundwater flow system the purpose of sensitivity analysis in this study is to 1 exclude insensitive parameters from bayesian inversion and 2 evaluate hydrogeologic system spatiotemporally thanks to the efficient bmars based sobol method the total order sensitivity indices si of head outputs at 15 well locations and 20 yearly time points to 15 input parameters i e total 15 20 15 4500 sis are conveniently computed preliminary investigation suggests that these sis are variant spatially and temporally for each input parameter it makes sense since these parameters are associated with spatially distributed hydrogeologic units whose properties may mostly affect the hydraulic heads at wells located within or near them this spatiotemporal variability of sis raises a challenge on how to evaluate overall importance of a parameter for screen purpose the spatially maximal si of each parameter at 15 different well locations is sorted out and summarized in table 2 for each of 20 yearly times the occurrence of si 0 2 which is considered sensitive are counted for each parameter over the 20 continuous years and shown in the 2nd row of table 2 obviously hydraulic conductivity of unit 1 2 4 and 5 hk 1 hk 2 hk 4 hk 5 are highly sensitive based on the fact that spatial maximal sis of all 20 yearly times are greater than 0 2 these four units are either primary aquifers or flow pathways of the groundwater flow in al fara area although only at two times are si greater than 0 2 for hk 3 the hydraulic conductivity of wadi alluvium this parameter is still somewhat sensitive and cannot be excluded from bayesian inference wadi alluvium overlies only a small portion of ophiolite in the valley surface explaining that its hk is not as important as that of other four units for the entire model system regarding specific storage ss 2 remains sensitive throughout 20 years of simulation while ss 5 is so at 8 times indicating that both of them play an important role in groundwater storage in contrast none of ss 1 ss 3 and ss 4 seems influential at any of 20 checked times according to the zero occurrence of si 0 2 specific yield on the other hand has little effect for all the hydrogeologic units except plain alluvium there is only one si of sy 4 greater than 0 2 at the first year of simulation though sy 4 is still considered sensitive to some degree based on the above analysis eight input parameters that is hk 1 hk 2 hk 3 hk 4 hk 5 ss 2 ss 5 and sy 4 are treated as controlling parameters of al fara groundwater flow system to be included in the bmars based bayesian inversion discussed in the next sub section see table 3 the spatially maximal sis for the eight sensitive parameters are visualized with the simulation time in fig 8 roughly hk 1 hk 2 hk 4 and ss 2 are highly sensitive as most of their sis are greater than 0 5 and hk 3 hk 5 ss 5 and sy 4 are second tier in sensitivity since sis are below 0 4 at most times with respect to the spatial variability sis for the eight sensitive parameters at 15 well locations at simulation time of year 10 and 20 are presented in fig 9 the wells from left to right at abscissa are sequenced from southern mountain to northern coastal plain see fig 5 for well locations as shown in fig 9a sis for hk 1 are very high at rq 1 and hz 5 the two southmost wells at highlands but drastically drop to near zero at subsequent wells it clearly indicates that hydraulic conductivity of unit 1 hajar super group can only affect areas as far as hz 5 and won t reach hz 1 and beyond note rq 1 and hz 5 are located at ophiolite zones but are the two closest wells to hajar super group just the opposite sis for hk 4 are zero at rq 1 and hz 5 and rise to 0 5 at hz 1 and finally reach above 0 8 at locations of alluvium areas this finding suggests hydraulic conductivity of plain alluvium won t influence flow in highland but plays a dominant role in the flow system in plain area hk 2 and ss 2 hydraulic conductivity and specific storage of ophiolite follow the similar spatial pattern in terms of si both parameters affect area including rq 1 hz 5 hz 1 jt 17 dp 5 and jt 14 with highest si at hz 5 this result is reasonable considering the relative close locations of these wells to ophiolite zone hk 3 s role is very limited in the entire flow system and only shows minor influence at hz 5 it is mostly due to the small volume portion of wadi alluvium hk 5 and ss 5 have little influence at the southmost three wells and show limited role at other wells northwards it can be explained by spatial distribution of upper fars zone which is located in northern part of domain it is noted that hk 5 becomes more important in areas near coast as its sis keep rising when approaching coast vertical cross section fig 2b of the model domain shows that the thickness of upper fars keeps increasing towards coast and occupies most area of the northern boundary this boundary is a constant head boundary allowing inflow and outflow which could be partially controlled by hydrogeologic properties of upper fars as for specific yield only sy 4 is somewhat sensitive because plain alluvium is the primary unconfined aquifer in al fara area and specific yield instead of specific storage takes the leading role in such hydrogeologic conditions according to flow equations of modflow the spatial sis at year 20 shows a pattern without significant difference to those at year 10 indicating temporal variability of si is not as significant as spatial variability as a summary for spatial variability hk 1 controls highland area including rq 1 and hz 5 and hk 4 dominates the left plain zones hk 2 and ss 2 affect areas between mountain and plain zones including 6 wells from rq 1 to jt 14 on the other hand hk 3 hk 5 ss 5 and sy 4 are less sensitive than the four parameters discussed above however hk 5 shows its innegligible effect near coast area in other words hydraulic conductivity of all the five units is sensitive storage properties either specific storage or specific yield are sensitive for unit 2 4 and 5 which are the major three aquifers of the target region unit 1 hajar super group consists of hardrock and bedrock while unit 3 wadi alluvium is sporadically deposited alluvium on gorges of ophiolite consequently neither of the two units could retain large volume of groundwater 4 3 bmars based bayesian inference bmars model is called 10 000 times during mcmc markov chain monte carlo burn in phase a procedure for parameter distribution to relax from the initial state gilks et al 1996 mcmc sampling procedure then run another 10 000 bmars models as a sample increment to create parameter posterior distributions and continues until the markov chain reaches convergence which is regarded to be reached if the posteriors won t change any more in this study the chain reaches convergence after four sample increments which means total model calls during mcmc is 50 000 note the maximum mcmc sampling size is set as 106 the time cost running bmars model and the associated bayesian inversion is negligible and the major efforts are made in 1000 representative modflow model simulations for generating training dataset as a result the bmars based bayesian inference improves inverse efficiency by 50 000 1000 50 times against the traditional approach in this case a single simulation of al fara modflow model takes about 8 min averagely in a normal computer that said the power of the proposed method can be more significant when a higher resolution model grid is needed for more realistic and complicated flow or reactive transport simulations fig 10 presents posterior pdf probability density function of the 8 parameters as well as 2d priors and posteriors between these parameters parameter values are normalized between 0 and 1 to facilitate effective inversion since prior distribution is assumed uniform for all the 8 parameters the 2d priors between any two of them show random likelihood however the 2d posteriors updated from priors with head observations reveal maximum likelihood area the corresponding posterior pdfs of each parameter are inferred from their uniform prior pdfs shown as red horizontal lines in fig 10 visually posterior distribution spread most widely for hk 3 suggesting little additional knowledge on the parameter is gained by inversion and least for hk 4 indicating significant uncertainty reduction achieved by incorporating head observations the low and high identifiability of hk 3 and hk 4 is consistent with their low and high sensitivity as discussed in sensitivity analysis in the previous section the dispersion of the distribution can be measured quantitatively by standard deviation the smaller the deviation is the less the spread is table 2 summarizes statistics for the posterior pdfs of the 8 parameters including standard deviation mean and the value at peak likelihood as shown in the table standard deviation for hk 3 and hk 4 is 0 296 the biggest and 0 103 the smallest respectively while those for the other 6 parameters are between them the modflow model with 8 parameter values at peak of likelihood from bayesian inference as listed in table 1 is executed and the simulated heads at well hz 5 is compared to 248 monthly observations as shown in fig 11 although the model didn t perform perfectly at those times with drastic head changes the simulated values match the general trend of head history well in fact the mean and maximum abstract error between simulated and observed head is only 1 11 and 4 87 m respectively which are very small considering head values are over 300 m at hz 5 this comparison demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed stochastic inversion methodology the relatively large discrepancy during sharp head changes are possibly caused by significant heterogeneity of each hydrogeologic unit which is treated homogeneous in modflow model in this study as a result the modflow model is not sensitive enough to track the abrupt changes of flow conditions in other words the relatively high error originates from the modflow model not the stochastic inversing modeling 5 conclusions in this paper a surrogate model approximating a regional groundwater flow model was developed using bagging multivariate adaptive regression spline bmars algorithms the cheap bmars model replaced a high fidelity groundwater flow model in sobol sensitivity analysis and bayesian mcmc inversion both of which require a large number of model iterations the bmars based bayesian framework was successfully implemented and demonstrated by stochastically calibrating a regional modflow model in al fara area in oman the simulated heads with parameter values at peak of likelihood show good match with observations in well hz 5 demonstrating reasonable accuracy of developed stochastic inversing modeling method in the test case bmars based bayesian inference entailing 50 thousands model runs was accomplished in no time while a single modflow model simulation can cost around 8 min the developed stochastic optimization framework was demonstrated computationally high efficient indicating that more complicated hydrologic system can be addressed when the cost of physical model becomes unaffordable sobol total order sensitivity indices can also be rapidly calculated using the bmars model providing a powerful variance based global sensitivity analysis tool future work will be focused on extending the bmars technique to more realistic and complicated problems that incorporate higher resolution grids variable density flow conditions e g seawater intrusion contaminant reactive transport simulation or water resources management and contamination risk assessment aspects that could impossibly be coped with physical hydrologic models it is because the developed framework methodology is model independent and any model other than modflow or a chain of models could be readily and flexibly integrated in addition to hydrogeologic property parameters operational parameters such as well number location and abstraction rate can be treated as uncertain variables to be optimized stochastically to facilitate groundwater resources management this operation related optimization will also be better constrained once a hydrologic model in natural condition is achieved as described above the obtained posterior pdfs can be used as prior pdf for another deterministic or stochastic optimization while only hydraulic head observation data are used in this case study various data sources such as flux could be jointly inversed this kind of extension can be accomplished by developing a new bmars model using the updated training dataset generated from the existing representative modflow simulations where flux is already simulated it has been emphasized in the context that the primary computational cost for bmars based bayesian framework is for running the suite of representative simulations and the time cost for bmars model fitting validation and the inversion process is trivial with the new data the surrogate based inversion can be conducted to update posterior distributions conveniently without requirement to run physical models it should be noted that bmars model induces additional errors from modflow model although it is cross validated against modflow model in this study it would be interesting to investigate its impact and propagation to posterior distributions by taking advantage of bayesian inference smith et al 2015 in this study the errors between bmars predicted and observed data are assumed to follow multivariate normal distribution to simplify the bayesian treatment which are usually correct for large number of samples however a more rigorous discussion on likelihood functions is expected in future application of this bayesian framework schoups and vrugt 2010 acknowledgements this work was performed under grant sr sci eths

7526,bayesian inference using markov chain monte carlo mcmc provides an explicit framework for stochastic calibration of hydrogeologic models accounting for uncertainties however the mcmc sampling entails a large number of model calls and could easily become computationally unwieldy if the high fidelity hydrogeologic model simulation is time consuming this study proposes a surrogate based bayesian framework to address this notorious issue and illustrates the methodology by inverse modeling a regional modflow model the high fidelity groundwater model is approximated by a fast statistical model using bagging multivariate adaptive regression spline bmars algorithm and hence the mcmc sampling can be efficiently performed in this study the modflow model is developed to simulate the groundwater flow in an arid region of oman consisting of mountain coast aquifers and used to run representative simulations to generate training dataset for bmars model construction a bmars based sobol method is also employed to efficiently calculate input parameter sensitivities which are used to evaluate and rank their importance for the groundwater flow model system according to sensitivity analysis insensitive parameters are screened out of bayesian inversion of the modflow model further saving computing efforts the posterior probability distribution of input parameters is efficiently inferred from the prescribed prior distribution using observed head data demonstrating that the presented bmars based bayesian framework is an efficient tool to reduce parameter uncertainties of a groundwater system keywords modflow bayesian inverse modeling surrogate bagging mars 1 introduction numerical simulation of a groundwater flow system requires knowledge of hydrologic characteristics of the aquifers such as hydraulic conductivity and specific storage of hydrogeologic units complete knowledge of these properties are usually very hard to obtain in the subsurface and the incurred uncertainty will reduce the predictive capability of the groundwater model and impair the reliability of groundwater resources management based on model predictions to improve the model accuracy and reduce uncertainties many inverse modeling methods have been developed to estimate hydrologic parameters by matching modeled results to corresponding field measurements e g carrera 1988 dai and samper 2004 carrera et al 2005 hill and tiedeman 2007 tonkin and doherty 2009 sadeghi tabas et al 2016 shang et al 2016 whereas applications of these methods are usually limited by considerable number of forward model simulations required during inverse modeling wagner 1995 jordan et al 2015 owing to the insufficient knowledge of the aquifers considerable uncertainties might be introduced into groundwater modeling systems yielding ill posed inverse problems with non unique solutions de marsily et al 1999 to cope with this issue bayesian inference has been studied and applied extensively as an effective inverse framework yielding a parameter posterior probability distribution instead of a deterministic solution from its prior distribution oliver et al 1997 kavetski et al 2006 fu and gomez hernandez 2009 tarantola 2004 the analytical solutions of posterior distribution are usually very difficult to obtain in bayesian inversion khaleghi et al 2013 instead markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods provide a practical tool to draw samples from the specified target distribution to numerically approximate posterior distributions for groundwater model parameters hassan et al 2009 efendiev et al 2011 laloy et al 2013 however when dealing with large scale high fidelity groundwater models mcmc methods may become computationally burdensome because of the considerable number of uncertain parameters to be estimated and many times of repeated forward model calls for posterior distribution to reach convergence smith and marshall 2008 there are primarily four promising ways to address this issue include 1 parallel calculation and grid computing e g kerrou et al 2010 2 improvement of mcmc sampling algorithms e g vrugt et al 2009 rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2016 3 reduction of inverse model dimension that is excluding insensitive physical properties and only keep key parameters in bayesian inversion e g kerrou and renard 2010 chen et al

handling high dimensional data and its stability can be enhanced by bootstrap aggregating namely bagging bühlmann and yu 2002 bagging is a kind of smoothing operation which could be used to improve mars model prediction bühlmann 2003 in our recent study bagging mars bmars surrogate model was coupled with an optimizer to numerically calibrate a complicated modflow for simulation of groundwater

sobol 1993 for highly efficient global sa of modflow model parameters according to importance ranking the insensitive parameters are thus identified and excluded from bayesian inversion without losing key physical characteristics of the original model the dimension of inverse modeling is reduced and computing efforts are focused on the most important parameters the presentation of the study is

groundwater flow model development bmars model construction sobol sensitivity analysis and bayesian inference using bmars model in this section the methodology framework is illustrated firstly followed by detailed description of core components 2 1 bmars based bayesian inversion framework the proposed inversion framework proceeds as follows fig 1 1 m input parameters are chosen with uncertainties defined by their distributions and ranges which are representative of prior knowledge of the groundwater flow system in this study the parameters are hydrogeologic characteristics of the aquifers including hydraulic conductivity specific storage and specific yield 2 n input m vectors are sampled from their prior probability density functions pdf using latin hypercube l h method mckay et al 1979 these n realizations are used to generate input files to run n modflow model simulations and their corresponding responses in our case below heads at observation wells are obtained 3 the n input vector response pairs shaded in fig 1 are used to train and cross validate bmars surrogate model leave one out cross validation loocv approach is used for surrogate model validation picard and cook 1984 4 the importance of the input parameters of the modflow model is ranked according to sobol total order sensitivity indices sobol 1993 which is efficiently computed using cheap bmars model only top sensitive parameters are considered influential to the hydrogeologic system and included in bayesian inversion 5 the bmars model is utilized in place of the modflow model within a bayesian inversion scheme from which posterior distributions of the sensitive parameters are inferred by comparisons with observed head data the posterior pdfs represent a subset of the prior data that yield indeterminate solutions with highest probabilities the bmars driven bayesian inference framework is programmed in python script by coupling modflow model with various algorithms mentioned above i e l h sampling bmars approximation loocv sobol method and bayesian inference the suite of modflow simulations are distributed to and executed on high performance computing facility at sultan qaboos university in oman 2 2 modflow model in modflow the groundwater mass balance equation governing transient groundwater flow is written as bear 1972 1 x kx h x y ky h y z kz h z ss h t w where t is the

yield and b is the aquifer thickness l according to eq 1 k ss and sy are important parameters to hydraulic dynamics and hence initially treated as uncertain parameters to be inferred fig 1 the modflow nwt version is chosen in this study because it is packed with newton solver and upstream weighting module and superior to deal with drying rewetting process of the unconfined aquifer flow problem in the test case niswonger et al 2011 2 3 bagging multivariate adaptive regression spline bmars a mars model can be expressed as 2 f x i 1 k c i j 1 j i s ji x v j i t ji where x is the m dimensional input parameter vector k and c i are the number and coefficients of associated basis functions ji is the interaction order of basis function i e the number of input parameters included in the basis

expectation of mars models and usually approximated by monte carlo method below breiman 1996 3 f bmars 1 b b 1 b f b x where f b x is the mars model and b is defined as the instantiation number of mars model for monte carlo approximation 2 4 sobol sensitivity indices the sobol method is a variance based global sensitivity calculation approach the variance of response y is decomposed into fractions which are attributed to each input parameter 1st order indices and their interactions 2nd and higher order indices the sobol sensitivity indices si can be calculated as follows sobol 2001 4 si i var e y x i var y 5 si ij var e y x i x j var e y x i var e y x j var y 6 si ti si i j i si ij j i k j si ijk where si i si ij si ijk and si ti are the 1st 2nd 3rd and total order indices of input parameter x i respectively sobol total order sensitivity measures the contribution of each input parameter to the uncertainty of output y including all variances caused by its interactions with any other parameters in all the orders traditional sobol method calculates output response y using physical model f x and usually is very time consuming in our surrogate based sobol method bmars model f bmars is used in place of modflow model f x to achieve fast estimation of sobol total order sensitivity indices 2 5 bmars based bayesian inversion bayesian inversion aims to reduce parameter uncertainty by integrating prior information in form of prior pdf and the observations through the inference of the posterior pdf according to bayes theorem posterior distribution p x y can be expressed as 7 p x y p y x p x p y where x is the parameter vector to be inversed y is the observations p x is the parameter prior probability p y is the marginal distribution and usually a normalized constant and p y x is the likelihood function which measure the fitness between predictions and observations the errors between simulated and observed head is calculated as 8 ε y f x where f x is the predictions from groundwater flow models the errors ε is usually assumed to follow multivariate normal distribution with covariance matrix c resulting in gaussian likelihood function defined as zeng et al 2012 9 p y x exp ε t c 1 ε 2 2 π n 2 c 1 2 where c is the determinant of c and n is the number of observations in this study bmars surrogate model f bmars is used as an approximation of physical modflow model f x to evaluate p y x as a result the posterior probability distribution p x y can be calculated without executing expensive modflow models during mcmc sampling and thus significantly improves bayesian inversion efficiency 3 al fara regional groundwater flow model to illustrate the proposed framework methodology a hydrogeologic system consisting of mountain hardrock and coastal alluvium in al fara area of oman is chosen as the test case due to available data and knowledge from the extensive studies of this region amerjeed 2016 3 1 study area the study area wadi al fara catchment covers a 1172 km2 area extending from 522 700 to 570 700 e in longitude and from 2 559 400 to 2 633 900 n in latitude in north oman as shown in fig 2 a it originates from the northwest slopes of the mountain towards northern coastal plain for about 70 km to the sea the average winter temperatures range between 20 and 28 c in the study area while it may reach over 40 c in summer the average annual rainfall is between 73 and 270 mm year from coastal to mountain zone while the potential evapotranspiration may reach 2300 mm year in this area ground surface elevations drop rapidly from a maximum of 3000 m at the southern mountain to 100 m at the base of the piedmont and then to sea level at the coast fig 2b the mountainous zone generally lacks vegetation with little soil coverage wadi beds and their banks are inhabited with limited agriculture developed on terraces irrigated by aflaj originating from springs the coastal plain is made up of relatively uniform alluvial sediments and is the most extensive agricultural regions irrigated by groundwater 3 2 geologic model digital elevation model obtained from nasa shuttle radar topography mission and stratigraphy data from 57 borehole logs in the target area geo resources consultants 2006 are used to build the 3d geological model fig 3 as shown in fig 2b the geological structure consists of six primary hydrostratigraphic units that is hajar super group ophiolite wadi alluvium plain alluvium upper fars and lower fars hajar super group comprises carbonate rocks and dolomite siltstones and sandstones it is highly heterogeneous fractured and karstified as the upper mountain zone its surface covers 340 km2 and receives most of the rainfall in the target area ophiolite is characterized as fracture aquifer covered by wadi alluvium in valleys this middle valley zone covers about 350 km2 of area the plain alluvium is deposited as vari coloured sand interbedded with cemented and silty gravels it covers the total coastal plain an area of 480 km2 and serves as the most important aquifer in the study area beneath the plain alluvium is the upper fars which comprised dolomites limestone with interbeds of thin siltstones towards the base and it is the second important aquifer of al fara area the underlying lower fars produces little water and mainly serves as the impermeable bedrock it is characterized by mudstone claystone variably cemented gravels and calcareous shale 3 3 numerical model based upon the geological model the model domain is discretized into 150 rows 97 columns and 6 layers in modflow every layer consists of 14 550 cells whose area is 500 m by 500 m each cells that fall out of the model boundary are flagged as inactive in model simulations and removed from fig 4 the model is bounded by groundwater divide along the mountain ridge as the no flow southern boundary and the coast of the oman sea as the northern boundary with specified zero constant head previous studies show that the general groundwater flow is from the south highland to the north coast plain hence eastern and western boundaries are assumed parallel with groundwater flow direction and no flow the bottom layer is treated no flow boundary as impermeable bedrock time variant recharge estimated from rainfall evapotranspiration abstraction is specified on the top layer as shown in fig 5 hajor super group ophiolite wadi alluvium and plain alluvium are distributed from southern mountain area to the coast plain on the top layer head measurements are obtained from the 15 observations wells located in the target area as green solid circles shown in fig 5 alluvium material including both wadi and plain alluvium units disappear on the underlying layers impermeable low fars occurs from layer 3 indicating the layer 1 and 2 are the main flow path for groundwater from mountains to the coast fig 6 owing to the data availability the model simulates the groundwater flow in the target area over 20 years from january 1993 to september 2013 with 248 monthly stress periods totally the initial head data for the model are obtained from the measurements in january 1993 using empirical bayesian kriging interpolation method izady et al 2017 3 4 modflow simulations in the proposed method bmars models are constructed using a training dataset which is composed of sample inputs and associated responses from modflow simulations considering parameter uncertainties the scenarios of these simulations should represent various conditions of the physical system as complete as possible in this case the uncertainties are represented by range and distribution of key properties of five hydrogeologic units that is hydraulic conductivity specific storage and specific yield resulting in 15 uncertain parameters totally note that the 6th unit lower fars is considered impermeable bedrock and its properties are given fixed values as presented in table 1 the ranges of the 15 parameters account for our best knowledge about al fara groundwater flow system and expected to be improved by numerical method of bayesian inversion using monthly head measurements from 15 observation wells following the procedure in fig 1 the 15 uncertain parameters as a vector are sampled 1000 times within their ranges using l h method yielding 1000 modflow models the log transformed hydraulic conductivity and the other two properties are assumed to follow uniform random distribution in their ranges the outputs of the 1000 model simulations along with the corresponding input sample values form the training dataset for bmars model development as illustrated as gray area of fig 1 4 results and discussions 4 1 bmars model development during the bagging process 100 mars models b 100 in eq 3 are instantiated to approximate the bmars model and each mars model is developed by 100 basis functions and 8 variables k 100 ji 8 in eq 2 a well fitted bmars model does not necessarily mean good predictive ability due to over fitting and model validation is required for quality control the cross validation of bmars models in this study is conducted by loocv method which can use the existing training dataset without requiring additional test dataset picard and cook 1984 the quality of the bmars models is examined by scatter plots comparing true data from modflow model and predicted data by bmars model fig 7 gives an example for head output at well rq 1 see fig 5 for location at the last simulation stress to examine how bmars model approximates modflow model the 1000 points associated with predicted head values from bmars are plotted against true data from 1000 modflow simulations the well fitted bmars model fitting r 2 0 9954 show excellent predictive performance validation r 2 0 9976 during model cross validation the scaled root mean square errors rmse for fitting and validating bmars model are 0 01298 and 0 02165 respectively suggesting a remarkable goodness of fit of surrogate with physical models standard deviations for each head prediction by bmars model are also calculated based on the associated 100 instantiations of mars models in fig 7b only those heads whose true value from modflow falls outside the range one standard deviation of the predicted values from bmars are plotted with error bar for a clear display as a result none of those error bars intersect with the diagonal in the fig 7b 4 2 sensitivity analysis as discussed in introduction section sensitivity analysis provides a useful tool to identify the key properties that control the groundwater flow system the purpose of sensitivity analysis in this study is to 1 exclude insensitive parameters from bayesian inversion and 2 evaluate hydrogeologic system spatiotemporally thanks to the efficient bmars based sobol method the total order sensitivity indices si of head outputs at 15 well locations and 20 yearly time points to 15 input parameters i e total 15 20 15 4500 sis are conveniently computed preliminary investigation suggests that these sis are variant spatially and temporally for each input parameter it makes sense since these parameters are associated with spatially distributed hydrogeologic units whose properties may mostly affect the hydraulic heads at wells located within or near them this spatiotemporal variability of sis raises a challenge on how to evaluate overall importance of a parameter for screen purpose the spatially maximal si of each parameter at 15 different well locations is sorted out and summarized in table 2 for each of 20 yearly times the occurrence of si 0 2 which is considered sensitive are counted for each parameter over the 20 continuous years and shown in the 2nd row of table 2 obviously hydraulic conductivity of unit 1 2 4 and 5 hk 1 hk 2 hk 4 hk 5 are highly sensitive based on the fact that spatial maximal sis of all 20 yearly times are greater than 0 2 these four units are either primary aquifers or flow pathways of the groundwater flow in al fara area although only at two times are si greater than 0 2 for hk 3 the hydraulic conductivity of wadi alluvium this parameter is still somewhat sensitive and cannot be excluded from bayesian inference wadi alluvium overlies only a small portion of ophiolite in the valley surface explaining that its hk is not as important as that of other four units for the entire model system regarding specific storage ss 2 remains sensitive throughout 20 years of simulation while ss 5 is so at 8 times indicating that both of them play an important role in groundwater storage in contrast none of ss 1 ss 3 and ss 4 seems influential at any of 20 checked times according to the zero occurrence of si 0 2 specific yield on the other hand has little effect for all the hydrogeologic units except plain alluvium there is only one si of sy 4 greater than 0 2 at the first year of simulation though sy 4 is still considered sensitive to some degree based on the above analysis eight input parameters that is hk 1 hk 2 hk 3 hk 4 hk 5 ss 2 ss 5 and sy 4 are treated as controlling parameters of al fara groundwater flow system to be included in the bmars based bayesian inversion discussed in the next sub section see table 3 the spatially maximal sis for the eight sensitive parameters are visualized with the simulation time in fig 8 roughly hk 1 hk 2 hk 4 and ss 2 are highly sensitive as most of their sis are greater than 0 5 and hk 3 hk 5 ss 5 and sy 4 are second tier in sensitivity since sis are below 0 4 at most times with respect to the spatial variability sis for the eight sensitive parameters at 15 well locations at simulation time of year 10 and 20 are presented in fig 9 the wells from left to right at abscissa are sequenced from southern mountain to northern coastal plain see fig 5 for well locations as shown in fig 9a sis for hk 1 are very high at rq 1 and hz 5 the two southmost wells at highlands but drastically drop to near zero at subsequent wells it clearly indicates that hydraulic conductivity of unit 1 hajar super group can only affect areas as far as hz 5 and won t reach hz 1 and beyond note rq 1 and hz 5 are located at ophiolite zones but are the two closest wells to hajar super group just the opposite sis for hk 4 are zero at rq 1 and hz 5 and rise to 0 5 at hz 1 and finally reach above 0 8 at locations of alluvium areas this finding suggests hydraulic conductivity of plain alluvium won t influence flow in highland but plays a dominant role in the flow system in plain area hk 2 and ss 2 hydraulic conductivity and specific storage of ophiolite follow the similar spatial pattern in terms of si both parameters affect area including rq 1 hz 5 hz 1 jt 17 dp 5 and jt 14 with highest si at hz 5 this result is reasonable considering the relative close locations of these wells to ophiolite zone hk 3 s role is very limited in the entire flow system and only shows minor influence at hz 5 it is mostly due to the small volume portion of wadi alluvium hk 5 and ss 5 have little influence at the southmost three wells and show limited role at other wells northwards it can be explained by spatial distribution of upper fars zone which is located in northern part of domain it is noted that hk 5 becomes more important in areas near coast as its sis keep rising when approaching coast vertical cross section fig 2b of the model domain shows that the thickness of upper fars keeps increasing towards coast and occupies most area of the northern boundary this boundary is a constant head boundary allowing inflow and outflow which could be partially controlled by hydrogeologic properties of upper fars as for specific yield only sy 4 is somewhat sensitive because plain alluvium is the primary unconfined aquifer in al fara area and specific yield instead of specific storage takes the leading role in such hydrogeologic conditions according to flow equations of modflow the spatial sis at year 20 shows a pattern without significant difference to those at year 10 indicating temporal variability of si is not as significant as spatial variability as a summary for spatial variability hk 1 controls highland area including rq 1 and hz 5 and hk 4 dominates the left plain zones hk 2 and ss 2 affect areas between mountain and plain zones including 6 wells from rq 1 to jt 14 on the other hand hk 3 hk 5 ss 5 and sy 4 are less sensitive than the four parameters discussed above however hk 5 shows its innegligible effect near coast area in other words hydraulic conductivity of all the five units is sensitive storage properties either specific storage or specific yield are sensitive for unit 2 4 and 5 which are the major three aquifers of the target region unit 1 hajar super group consists of hardrock and bedrock while unit 3 wadi alluvium is sporadically deposited alluvium on gorges of ophiolite consequently neither of the two units could retain large volume of groundwater 4 3 bmars based bayesian inference bmars model is called 10 000 times during mcmc markov chain monte carlo burn in phase a procedure for parameter distribution to relax from the initial state gilks et al 1996 mcmc sampling procedure then run another 10 000 bmars models as a sample increment to create parameter posterior distributions and continues until the markov chain reaches convergence which is regarded to be reached if the posteriors won t change any more in this study the chain reaches convergence after four sample increments which means total model calls during mcmc is 50 000 note the maximum mcmc sampling size is set as 106 the time cost running bmars model and the associated bayesian inversion is negligible and the major efforts are made in 1000 representative modflow model simulations for generating training dataset as a result the bmars based bayesian inference improves inverse efficiency by 50 000 1000 50 times against the traditional approach in this case a single simulation of al fara modflow model takes about 8 min averagely in a normal computer that said the power of the proposed method can be more significant when a higher resolution model grid is needed for more realistic and complicated flow or reactive transport simulations fig 10 presents posterior pdf probability density function of the 8 parameters as well as 2d priors and posteriors between these parameters parameter values are normalized between 0 and 1 to facilitate effective inversion since prior distribution is assumed uniform for all the 8 parameters the 2d priors between any two of them show random likelihood however the 2d posteriors updated from priors with head observations reveal maximum likelihood area the corresponding posterior pdfs of each parameter are inferred from their uniform prior pdfs shown as red horizontal lines in fig 10 visually posterior distribution spread most widely for hk 3 suggesting little additional knowledge on the parameter is gained by inversion and least for hk 4 indicating significant uncertainty reduction achieved by incorporating head observations the low and high identifiability of hk 3 and hk 4 is consistent with their low and high sensitivity as discussed in sensitivity analysis in the previous section the dispersion of the distribution can be measured quantitatively by standard deviation the smaller the deviation is the less the spread is table 2 summarizes statistics for the posterior pdfs of the 8 parameters including standard deviation mean and the value at peak likelihood as shown in the table standard deviation for hk 3 and hk 4 is 0 296 the biggest and 0 103 the smallest respectively while those for the other 6 parameters are between them the modflow model with 8 parameter values at peak of likelihood from bayesian inference as listed in table 1 is executed and the simulated heads at well hz 5 is compared to 248 monthly observations as shown in fig 11 although the model didn t perform perfectly at those times with drastic head changes the simulated values match the general trend of head history well in fact the mean and maximum abstract error between simulated and observed head is only 1 11 and 4 87 m respectively which are very small considering head values are over 300 m at hz 5 this comparison demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed stochastic inversion methodology the relatively large discrepancy during sharp head changes are possibly caused by significant heterogeneity of each hydrogeologic unit which is treated homogeneous in modflow model in this study as a result the modflow model is not sensitive enough to track the abrupt changes of flow conditions in other words the relatively high error originates from the modflow model not the stochastic inversing modeling 5 conclusions in this paper a surrogate model approximating a regional groundwater flow model was developed using bagging multivariate adaptive regression spline bmars algorithms the cheap bmars model replaced a high fidelity groundwater flow model in sobol sensitivity analysis and bayesian mcmc inversion both of which require a large number of model iterations the bmars based bayesian framework was successfully implemented and demonstrated by stochastically calibrating a regional modflow model in al fara area in oman the simulated heads with parameter values at peak of likelihood show good match with observations in well hz 5 demonstrating reasonable accuracy of developed stochastic inversing modeling method in the test case bmars based bayesian inference entailing 50 thousands model runs was accomplished in no time while a single modflow model simulation can cost around 8 min the developed stochastic optimization framework was demonstrated computationally high efficient indicating that more complicated hydrologic system can be addressed when the cost of physical model becomes unaffordable sobol total order sensitivity indices can also be rapidly calculated using the bmars model providing a powerful variance based global sensitivity analysis tool future work will be focused on extending the bmars technique to more realistic and complicated problems that incorporate higher resolution grids variable density flow conditions e g seawater intrusion contaminant reactive transport simulation or water resources management and contamination risk assessment aspects that could impossibly be coped with physical hydrologic models it is because the developed framework methodology is model independent and any model other than modflow or a chain of models could be readily and flexibly integrated in addition to hydrogeologic property parameters operational parameters such as well number location and abstraction rate can be treated as uncertain variables to be optimized stochastically to facilitate groundwater resources management this operation related optimization will also be better constrained once a hydrologic model in natural condition is achieved as described above the obtained posterior pdfs can be used as prior pdf for another deterministic or stochastic optimization while only hydraulic head observation data are used in this case study various data sources such as flux could be jointly inversed this kind of extension can be accomplished by developing a new bmars model using the updated training dataset generated from the existing representative modflow simulations where flux is already simulated it has been emphasized in the context that the primary computational cost for bmars based bayesian framework is for running the suite of representative simulations and the time cost for bmars model fitting validation and the inversion process is trivial with the new data the surrogate based inversion can be conducted to update posterior distributions conveniently without requirement to run physical models it should be noted that bmars model induces additional errors from modflow model although it is cross validated against modflow model in this study it would be interesting to investigate its impact and propagation to posterior distributions by taking advantage of bayesian inference smith et al 2015 in this study the errors between bmars predicted and observed data are assumed to follow multivariate normal distribution to simplify the bayesian treatment which are usually correct for large number of samples however a more rigorous discussion on likelihood functions is expected in future application of this bayesian framework schoups and vrugt 2010 acknowledgements this work was performed under grant sr sci eths

7527,the interactions between the extremely shallow funnel shaped topography and dynamic processes in the north branch nb of the changjiang estuary produce a particular type of saltwater intrusion saltwater spillover sso from the nb into the south branch sb this dominant type of saltwater intrusion threatens the winter water supplies of reservoirs located in the estuary simulated sso was weaker than actual sso in previous studies and this problem has not been solved until now the improved ecom si model with the advection scheme hsimt tvd was applied in this study logarithmic and chézy manning formulas of the bottom drag coefficient bdc were established in the model to investigate the associated effect on saltwater intrusion in the nb modeled data and data collected at eight measurement stations located in the nb from february 19 to march 1 2017 were compared and three skill assessment indicators the correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and skill score ss of water velocity and salinity were used to quantitatively validate the model the results indicated that the water velocities modeled using the chézy manning formula of bdc were slightly more accurate than those based on the logarithmic bdc formula but the salinities produced by the latter formula were more accurate than those of the former the results showed that the bdc increases when water depth decreases during ebb tide and the results based on the chézy manning formula were smaller than those based on the logarithmic formula additionally the landward net water flux in the upper reaches of the nb during spring tide increases based on the chézy manning formula and saltwater intrusion in the nb was enhanced especially in the upper reaches of the nb at a transect in the upper reaches of the nb the net transect water flux ntwf is upstream in spring tide and downstream in neap tide and the values produced by the chézy manning formula are much larger than those based on the logarithmic formula notably sso during spring tide was 1 8 times larger based on the chézy manning formula than that based on the logarithmic formula the model underestimated sso and salinity at the hydrological stations in the sb based on the logarithmic bdc formula but successfully simulated sso and the temporal variations in salinity in the sb using the chézy manning formula of bdc keywords saltwater intrusion bottom drag coefficient numerical model skill assessment changjiang estuary 1 introduction in single channel estuaries saltwater intrusion generally develops in the along channel direction however in bifurcated estuaries lateral saltwater intrusion may be significant and can play an important role in determining the temporal variation and spatial distribution of salinity in the spring neap tidal cycle wu et al 2006 gong and shen 2011 wang et al 2012 the changjiang also known as the yangtze river is one of the largest rivers in the world the changjiang estuary has a 90 km wide river mouth and is characterized by multiple bifurcations fig 1 firstly the estuary is divided by chongming island into the south branch sb and north branch nb the sb and its lower reaches form the main channel of the changjiang and contribute to the majority of river discharge while the nb is heavily silted secondly the lower sb is bifurcated into the south channel sc and the north channel nc by changxing island and hengsha island finally the sc is bifurcated into the south passage sp and the north passage np by jiuduansha island according to water column stratification or vertical salinity structure estuaries can be divided into three categories type a salt wedge or strongly stratified type b partially mixed and type c vertically well mixed prichard 1955 cameron and prichard 1963 shen et al 2003 concluded that the nb and sb belong to the type c and the nc np and sp present as type b during spring tide and present as type a during neap tide saltwater intrusion in the changjiang estuary is mainly controlled by the river discharge and tide shen et al 2003 wu et al 2006 li et al 2010 zhu et al 2010 qiu et al 2012 but is also influenced by wind li et al 2012 topography li et al 2014 river basin and estuarine projects zhu et al 2006 qiu and zhu 2013 and sea level rise qiu and zhu 2015 river discharge is recorded at the datong gauge station which is located 620 km from the changjiang mouth discharge exhibits pronounced seasonal variations with the lowest monthly mean value of 11 200 m3s 1 in january and the highest monthly mean value of 49 700 m3s 1 in july changjiang water resources commission based on data from 1950 to 2016 the tides in the estuary exhibits semidiurnal diurnal and fortnightly spring neap signals zhu et al 2015 the natural evolution and artificial reclamation of the intertidal zone from the 1950s to 2000s has severely narrowed the upper reaches of the nb zhu and bao 2016 consequently the upper reaches of the nb have become almost orthogonal to the sb while the lower reaches have become funnel shaped the evolution of the river regime of the nb has helped to prevent runoff from entering the nb especially during the dry season was also making the tidal range larger in the nb than in the sb strong tidal forcing in the nb induces significant subtidal circulation resulting in a net landward flow when river discharge is low during spring tide wu et al 2006 xue et al 2009 this residual transport forms a type of saltwater intrusion known as saltwater spillover sso from the nb into the sb which is the most characteristic type of saltwater intrusion in the estuary during spring tide the water level rises considerably in the upper reaches of the nb due to its funnel shape leading to a massive amount of sso from the shoals into the sb only a small amount of the saltwater returns to the nb because the shoals in the upper reaches of the nb are exposed to the air during ebb tide the saltwater that is spilled into the sb is transported downstream by runoff and arrives in the middle reaches of the sb during the subsequent neap tide this process impacts dongfengxisha reservoir chenhang reservoir and qingcaosha reservoir qcsr and threatens shanghai s water supply the massive qcsr was built in 2010 along the northwestern portion of changxing island and it supplies more than 70 of the freshwater for shanghai water from the changjiang is allowed to flow into qcsr when the salinity is lower than 0 45 the salinity standard of drinking water but this operation is suspended when saltwater intrusion influences the water intake although the author s research group has conducted intensive studies of saltwater intrusion in the changjiang estuary we found that the modeled sso was weaker than the real situation especially during spring tide the mean topographic depth is 3 07 3 44 and 5 07 m here and throughout the manuscript the datum is the mean sea level of the yellow sea in the upper middle and lower reaches of the nb and tidal flats with depths of less than 2 m account for 39 23 and 32 of these reaches respectively therefore the nb is extremely shallow the bottom drag coefficient bdc determined by the law of the wall in previous studies may be unsuitable for the extremely shallow nb the bdc c d is determined by the law of the wall and the logarithmic profile can be obtained via integration batchelor 1953 1 τ b ρ c d u b u b 2 c d 1 κ ln z b z 0 2 where τ b is the bottom friction stress c d is the bdc u b is the bottom current velocity at z b z b is the height from the bottom κ is the von karman constant equal to 0 4 and z 0 is the bottom roughness which is set to 0 001 m in this study in many studies the structure of tidally induced flow in channels and embayments has been characterized as logarithmic dyer 1980 soulsby and dyer 1981 lueck 1988 the logarithmic law of bdc c d may be unsuitable for extremely shallow waters collins et al 1998 analyzed 192 current velocity datasets collected from the tidal flats of the loughor estuary swansea bay and wash bay and found that fewer than 40 of the datasets were logarithmic in character in many previous studies of extremely shallow water the bdc c d has been written based on the chézy manning formula dronkers 1964 ludwick 1975 dunbar et al 1991 bokhorst 2003 3 c d g c 2 in this equation c is the chézy coefficient which can be determined from the manning roughness coefficient n chow 1959 4 c h 6 n where h is the water depth determining the value of the manning roughness coefficient becomes the key issue in this calculation notably the manning roughness coefficient varies with depth in shallow waters ree 1981 found that the manning roughness coefficient varied with the flow depth in a large number of flume experiments based on measurement data from gauge stations along the lower reaches of the yellow river qian et al 1959 concluded that the manning roughness coefficient gradually decreased with increasing water level chow 1959 argued that an increase in flow depth would cause a decrease in the manning roughness coefficient of most open channels knight 1981 and knight et al 2009 found that the manning roughness coefficients of the conwy estuary main river severn river waiwakaiho river and tomebamba river varied significantly with water stages through field measurements notably the manning roughness coefficient exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing tidal amplitude cheng et al 1993 found that the model results achieved a best fit to field data when the value of the manning roughness coefficient was assigned based on a range of water depths saltwater intrusion can produce estuarine circulation pritchard 1956 and effect stratification simpson et al 1990 thereby influencing sediment transport producing peak estuarine turbidities geyer 1993 and degrading the quality of freshwater flowing into reservoirs in the changjiang estuary based on numerical experiments of bdc we further studied saltwater intrusion in the nb to improve the simulation accuracy of sso in this paper the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes field observations the numerical model and experiments in section 3 the effect of the bdc on saltwater intrusion in the nb as well as sso is analyzed and discussed finally conclusions are presented in section 4 2 methods 2 1 observations we conducted the field observations in the nb from february 19 to march 1 2017 eight measurement stations located along the nb were sampled fig 1 we synchronously began the surveys at b d f and h stations black solid circles in fig 1 during the neap february 19 21 2017 fig 2 a to cover 4 complete semidiurnal tidal cycles the mean water depths of stations b d f and h were 2 80 4 28 6 14 and 8 02 m respectively one bottom mounted tripod was placed at each of these stations and one boat was secured close to each tripod after the observations during the neap tide we move the tripods and boats from stations b d f and h to stations a c e and g to conduct observations during the neap middle spring tide which february 21 27 2017 fig 2a lasted approximately 6 days the mean water depths of stations a c e and g were 2 45 2 65 4 37 and 6 01 m respectively after this observation period we again moved the tripods and boats to stations b d f and h to conduct observations during the spring tide observations were collected february 27 march 1 2017 fig 2a for at least 48 h to cover 4 complete semidiurnal tidal cycles at each measurement station the tripod was mounted to the river bottom and equipped with instruments 0 2 m above the river bottom a 600 khz acoustic doppler current profiler adcp rd instruments was used to measure the current profile an optical backscatter sensor obs 3a d a instrument company was used to measure salinity temperature and turbidity and an electromagnetic current meter alec electron ics tokyo was used to measure the near bottom current of the bottom zone of the adcp the adcp worked in upward looking mode to measure the current profile at a vertical resolution of 0 25 m and ensembles of 2 min at a 1 s ping interval an obs was dragged along the stern of each boat to measure surface salinity temperature and turbidity at a sampling rate of 2 min we calibrated the obs using water samples and the calibration process indicated that the instrument worked well in addition to the measurement stations in the nb water level and surface salinity data were collected at the long term hydrologic stations red solid circles in fig 1 in the sb established by the state key laboratory of estuarine and coastal research the river discharge at the datong gauge station was approximately 13 000 m3 s during the observation period fig 2b this flow rate was slightly higher than the climatological average of 11 800 m3 s in february meteorological data were recorded by the weather station located on the chongming eastern shoal w blue solid circles in fig 1 the northerly wind and southerly wind alternated during the observation period fig 2c moreover strong wind was detected during the neap tide february 20 2017 with a maximum wind speed of 12 m s 2 2 numerical model a 3d numerical model developed by wu and zhu 2010 was used in this study it was based on the ecom si blumberg 1994 and later improved by chen et al 2001 and zhu 2003 for studies of hydrodynamics and material transport the mellor yamada level 2 5 turbulence closure module mellor and yamada 1982 with stability parameters from kantha and clayson 1994 was included zhu et al 2002 adopted a predictor corrector scheme to change the coriolis terms into a semi implicit scheme and to improve the model stability in the case of low eddy viscosity wu 2006 replaced the fixed boundary in original ecom si with a moving boundary to present the process of drying and flooding of tidal flats third order spatial interpolation at a moderate temporal resolution coupled with a tvd limiter hsimt tvd advection scheme was used in this model to solve the transport equations and prevent numerical oscillations wu and zhu 2010 this approach has been successfully used in previous studies of saltwater intrusion in the changjiang estuary wu et al 2010 li et al 2012 qiu and zhu 2013 qiu and zhu 2015 the model used sigma coordinates in the vertical direction and a non orthogonal curvilinear grid in the horizontal direction a wet dry scheme was included to describe the intertidal flat with a critical depth of 0 1 m the model domain covered all of the changjiang estuary hangzhou bay and adjacent seas from 117 5 e to 125 e longitude and 27 5 n to 33 7 n latitude fig 3 a the model grid was composed of 337 225 cells horizontally and 10 uniform σ levels vertically the minimum grid resolution was approximately 100 m in the bifurcation of the sb and nb fig 3b and approximately 200 m in the lower reaches of the nb fig 3c to effectively simulate sso the resolution was decreased to 10 km at the open boundary the integrated time step was set to 30 s derived from the naotide dataset http www miz nao ac jp the open sea boundary was driven by 16 astronomical constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 q1 mu2 nu2 t2 l2 2 n2 j1 m1 and oo1 daily river discharge recorded at datong station was used in the model as the river boundary condition wind fields which were used to calculate sea surface momentum were simulated by the weather research forecast model wrf or using data from the weather station on the chongming eastern shoal the national center for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and a temporal resolution of 6 h was used to establish the initial and boundary conditions of the wrf model the velocity and elevation were initially set to zero the initial salinity distribution was derived from the ocean atlas of the huanghai sea and east china sea hydrology editorial board for marine atlas 1992 outside the changjiang mouth and from recent data collected in the estuary because salinity dominates the density variability in the changjiang estuary the water temperature was set to a constant 10 c in the model detailed descriptions of the model configuration and validation can be found in li et al 2012 and qiu and zhu 2013 2 3 numerical experiments we performed two numerical experiments to study the effect of the bdc on saltwater intrusion in the nb numerical experiment 1 exp1 adopted the logarithmic law of the bdc written as shown in eq 2 and numerical experiment 2 exp2 used the chézy manning formula given in eq 3 based on previous studies cheng et al 1993 bokhorst 2003 knight et al 2009 the manning roughness coefficient n as expressed by eq 4 was assigned for a range of water depths in the nb the coefficient varied from 0 010 at water depths greater than 10 m to 0 030 at water depths less than 2 0 m table 1 this method was also used to validate hydrodynamic salt and heat transport in ria de aveiro lagoon dias and lopes 2006 similarly ria de aveiro lagoon is very shallow and dias also assigned manning roughness based on a range of water depths as did hilmar messal and mengelkamp 2006 when simulating an inundation process in the ziltendorfer lowland 3 results 3 1 model validation and evaluation the numerical model described above has been validated many times in the changjiang estuary and the results suggest that the model can successfully simulate the hydrodynamic processes and saltwater intrusion in the estuary wu et al 2011 li et al 2012 qiu and zhu 2013 in this section we use the data collected in the nb from february 19 to march 1 2017 to validate the model for exp1 and exp2 and determine which bdc formula better reproduced the hydrodynamic and saltwater intrusion processes the following three skill assessment indicators were used to quantify the validation of current and salinity the correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and skill score ss 5 cc x mod x mod x obs x obs x mod x mod 2 x obs x obs 2 1 2 6 rmse x mod x obs 2 n 7 ss 1 x mod x obs 2 x mod x obs x obs x obs 2 where x mod is the modeled data x obs is the observed data and x is the mean value ss is a statistical metric developed by willmott 1981 to describe the degree to which the observed deviations from the observed mean correspond to the predicted derivations from the observed mean perfect agreement between the model results and observations yields an ss of 1 0 whereas complete disagreement yields a value of 0 these metrics were also used by warner et al 2005 and li et al 2005 to evaluate the consistency between their model results and observations of the hudson river estuary and chesapeake bay because the nb is extremely shallow the effect of bottom friction is important the water velocity of the surface layer is larger than that of the bottom layer and salinity is almost vertically homogeneous we choose the water velocities surface and bottom layers and salinities of the surface layers to present their temporal variations temporal variations in the observed and modeled water velocities and salinities at stations c e and g are shown in figs 4 6 respectively the measured data indicated that the water current and salinity exhibited distinct semidiurnal variations additionally the maximum flood velocity was larger than the maximum ebb velocity and the surface velocity was larger than the bottom velocity the maximum flood velocities were approximately 2 4 2 0 and 2 1 m s in the surface layer and 1 7 1 5 and 1 6 m s in the bottom layer at stations c e and g respectively the surface salinities at flood slack were higher than those at ebb slack and salinity decreased upstream the maximum values were 7 8 19 7 and 26 5 at stations c e and g respectively by comparing the modeled and observed data we can see that the modeled water velocities in exp2 which is based on the chézy manning bdc formula were slightly more accurate than those in exp1 based on a logarithmic bdc formula however the modeled salinities improvement in exp2 exhibited considerable compared to those in exp1 the indicator scores of water velocity are summarized in table 2 in exp1 the cc at the eight stations ranged from 0 52 to 0 90 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 77 and from 0 67 to 0 90 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 77 the rmse ranged from 0 26 to 0 50 m s in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 37 m s and from 0 18 to 0 34 m s in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 26 m s and the ss ranged from 0 45 to 0 93 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 71 and from 0 44 to 0 87 in the bottom layer with a mean value 0 71 in exp2 the cc at the eight measured stations ranged from 0 60 to 0 92 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 80 and from 0 65 to 0 90 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 80 the rmse ranged from 0 24 to 0 49 m s in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 35 m s and from 0 15 to 0 38 m s in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 26 m s and the ss ranged from 0 46 to 0 93 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 73 and from 0 42 to 0 92 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 72 the mean surface and bottom values of cc rmse and ss at the eight stations were 0 77 0 31 m s and 0 70 in exp1 and 0 80 0 30 m s and 0 72 in exp2 respectively therefore the model successfully captured the tidal currents and the chézy manning formula of bdc provided better results than the logarithmic bdc formula the indicator scores of salinity are summarized in table 3 in exp1 the cc at the eight stations ranged from 0 64 to 0 93 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 83 and from 0 54 to 0 91 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 81 the rmse ranged from 0 25 to 6 73 in the surface layer with a mean value of 3 90 and from 0 34 to 8 47 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 4 64 and the ss ranged from 0 41 to 0 77 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 52 and from 0 22 to 0 70 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 47 in exp2 the cc at the eight stations ranged from 0 79 to 0 92 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 87 at surface layer and from 0 65 to 0 92 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 84 the rmse ranged from 0 13 to 3 54 in the surface layer with a mean value of 1 79 and from 0 23 to 3 29 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 1 86 and the ss ranged from 0 65 to 0 92 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 84 and from 0 43 to 0 95 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 79 the mean surface and bottom values of cc rmse and ss of salinity at the eight stations were 0 82 4 27 and 0 49 in exp1 and 0 85 1 82 and 0 82 in exp2 respectively the ss was significantly higher in exp2 than in exp1 indicating that the model based on the logarithmic bdc formula underestimated salinity in the nb and the model based on the chézy manning formula of bdc successfully captured the temporal variations in salinity in the nb 3 2 mechanisms and discussion to improve the representativeness of the study we used the mean river discharge and wind in winter to simulate climatological saltwater intrusion in exp1 and exp2 and study the effects of different drag coefficients on saltwater intrusion the river discharge was set to 11 800 m3 s which was the climatological mean in january and february from 1950 to 2015 the surface wind was set to a constant northerly direction and speed of 5 m s which are approximately the mean wind conditions in winter 3 2 1 bdc the logarithmic formula of bdc is closely related to z b see formula 2 which is the height of half the bottom layer from the bottom of the model each vertical layer thickness varies with the total water depth the bdc will decrease when the total water depth increases during flood tide inserting formula 4 into formula 3 the bdc of the chézy manning formula can be written as follows 8 c d gn 2 h 3 therefore the bdc is related to water depth and the manning roughness coefficient n c d will increase when the water depth decreases the manning roughness coefficient n is dependent on water depth h table 1 and increases with decreasing h overall c d increases as h decreases the nb is extremely shallow and the tidal range is large zhu et al 2015 therefore the total water depth varies significantly with the flood and ebb tides to show the variation in the bdc with the tide we calculated the bdc distribution in exp1 and in exp2 during spring tide at the highest and lowest tidal levels fig 7 in exp1 the bdc is approximately 2 5 10 3 in most areas of the nb and approximately 3 5 10 3 in some very shallow areas at the highest tidal level fig 7a at the lowest tidal level when the nb becomes extremely shallow the bdc is approximately 4 1 10 3 in most areas of the upper and middle reaches of the nb and is slightly larger in the lower reaches of the nb compared with that at the highest tidal level fig 7c in exp2 the bdc is approximately 1 5 10 3 in most areas of the nb and approximately 3 2 10 3 in some very shallow areas at the highest tidal level fig 7b at the lowest tidal level the bdc is approximately 4 3 10 3 in most areas of the upper and middle reaches of the nb and is slightly larger in the lower reaches of the nb compared with that at the highest tidal level fig 7d therefore the bdc increases according to both the logarithmic and chézy manning formulas when the water depth decreases and the bdc values produced by the chézy manning formula are smaller than those of the logarithmic formula this difference could influence estimates of the net water flux and saltwater intrusion in the nb especially in the upper reaches of the nb 3 2 2 net water flux per unit width to describe the subtidal movements of water in the changjiang estuary we defined the instantaneous rate of water transport per unit width through a water column as follows 9 q 1 0 h v d σ then the residual net transport of water rw per unit width was calculated as follows 10 rw 1 t 0 t q dt where h is the total water depth v is the current velocity vector σ is the relative depth 0 at the surface and 1 at the bottom and t is the time period which equals one or several tidal cycles in this study six semidiurnal tidal cycles or 3 d were used as an averaging time window to remove the semidiurnal and diurnal tidal signals in exp1 during spring tide the residual water flux per unit width in the nb flows landward on the south side and seaward on the north side of the middle and lower reaches fig 8 a during neap tide the flux is smaller and flows seaward in the entire nb fig 8c in exp2 during spring tide the residual water flux per unit width still flows upstream but its magnitude is larger in the upper reaches than that in exp1 additionally the magnitude of the landward net water flux is largest in the lower reaches on the south side of the nb fig 8c during neap tide the net water flux is nearly equal to that in exp1 fig 8d the landward net water flux in the upper reaches of the nb during spring tide is evidently larger based on the chézy manning formula of the bdc than that based on the logarithmic bdc formula because the bottom friction in the former equation is much smaller than that in the latter equation 3 2 3 saltwater intrusion in exp1 during spring tide the nb is filled with highly saline water and the isohaline of 5 is close to the bifurcation of the nb and sb at the flood slack only a small area of salinity greater than 1 appears in the upper reaches of the sb suggesting that sso is weak during the spring tide fig 9 a during neap tide the salinity in the upper reaches of the nb decreases at the flood slack and no sso occurs fig 9c in exp2 the isohalines in the upper reaches of the nb move upstream compared to those in exp1 indicating that saltwater intrusion becomes stronger fig 9b moreover the area of salinity greater than 1 in the sb distinctly increases suggesting that sso occurs during neap tide only a small area of salinity greater than 1 in the sb exists along the south coast of chongming island and sso ceases fig 9d estimates of saltwater intrusion in the nb were enhanced using the logarithmic bdc formula compared to using the chézy manning formula of bdc especially in the upper reaches of the nb this finding is consistent with the dynamic variation in the net water flux discussed above 3 2 4 sso the most characteristic form of saltwater intrusion in the changjiang estuary is sso which is closely related to the saltwater intrusion in the nb we established a transect sec1 in the upper reaches of the nb near the bifurcation labeled in fig 1 to study the effect of the bdc on the water and salt fluxes through the transect the net transect water flux ntwf and net transect salt flux ntsf were calculated as follows 11 ntwf 1 t 0 t h x y ζ 0 l v n x y z t dldzdt 12 ntsf 1 t 0 t h x y ζ 0 l s v n x y z t dldzdt where ζ is the surface elevation l is the width of the transect s is the salinity and v n x y z t is the velocity component normal to the transect as shown in table 4 the ntwf is upstream in spring tide and downstream in neap tide in exp1 and exp2 but the values are much larger in exp2 than in exp1 with differences of 251 68 and 44 77 m3 s respectively this result suggests that more water is transported from the nb into the sb during spring tide and more water is transported from the sb into the nb during neap tide the ntsf varied similarly to the ntwf but the ntsf in exp2 was approximately 1 8 times higher than the value in exp1 during spring tide indicating that sso was 1 8 times higher based on the chézy manning formula of bdc than based on the logarithmic bdc formula in neap tide the ntsf is from the nb into the sb in exp1 but from the sb into the nb in exp2 and the flux is much smaller than that during spring tide the quantitative relationship of runoff and tidal range to the intensity of sso obtained by wu et al 2006 for the first time which indicates that the sso increases exponentially with the increase of tidal range and declines exponentially with the increase of runoff our model results are consistent with the conclusion of wu et al after saltwater enters the sb via sso it moves downstream under the force of runoff and influences the downstream salinity at the hydrological stations the chongxi and nanmen hydrological stations labeled in fig 1 are located on the southwest coast of chongming island and salinity there is completely due to sso wu et al 2006 li et al 2012 the salinities at the two hydrological stations are distinctly higher in exp2 than in exp1 fig 10 at chongxi hydrological station only sharp pulses of salinity exceed the salinity standard of drinking water in exp1 but salinity is higher than 0 45 more than half of the time in february in exp2 at nanmen hydrological station the salinity is slightly higher than 0 45 in some short periods and nearly lower than 0 45 in all of february in exp1 but the salinity is higher than 0 45 for approximately half of february in exp2 therefore adopting the chézy manning formula rather than the logarithmic bdc formula can overcome the issue of underestimating sso noted in previous studies as stated above we analyzed the sso based on the climatological states of river discharge and wind in winter but sso can be greatly enhanced when a cold front passes over the changjiang estuary li et al 2012 strong northerly winds could induce landward ekman water transport and strengthen sso next we present how sso responded to a strong northerly wind event from march 8 to 10 2016 with different bdc formulas the river discharge measured at datong station ranged from 16 000 to 21 000 m3 s with a mean value of 18 000 m3 s from march 1 to 15 2016 fig 11 a under normal circumstances sso would weaken when river discharge reaches 18 000 m3 s a strong northerly wind affected the estuary from march 8 to 10 2016 with a maximum wind speed of 23 m s and mean wind speed of 13 m s fig 11b the highest tidal level was predicted to occur on march 11 2016 the third day of the lunar calendar but was observed on march 9 2016 due to the strong northerly wind during the medium tide after neap tide fig 11c the strong northerly wind induced sso in the case of high river discharge and this influence was record at chongxi and nanmen hydrological stations fig 12 the results of the numerical model indicate that the model successfully hindcast sso and the temporal variations in salinity at the two hydrological stations using the chézy manning formula of bdc but underestimated the salinity when the logarithmic bdc formula was used therefore we further confirm that the bdc has an important influence on the sso in the estuary approximately 80 of freshwater in shanghai is currently taken from the reservoirs in the changjiang estuary and the most severe challenge is saltwater intrusion in winter especially sso it is important to adopt a suitable bdc to ensure water safety in the megalopolis of shanghai and improve the numerical forecasting accuracy of saltwater intrusion in the estuary 4 conclusions the nb is extremely shallow and the upper reaches of the nb are almost orthogonal to the sb additionally the lower reaches of the nb are funnel shaped the river regime of the nb helps prevent runoff from entering the nb during the dry season and makes the tidal range larger in the nb than in the sb the interaction between the topography and dynamic processes in the nb produces a special type of saltwater intrusion sso which threatens the winter water supplies of the reservoirs located in the estuary the improved ecom si model with the advection scheme hsimt tvd was applied in this study logarithmic and chézy manning bdc formulas were established in the model to investigate the associated effects on saltwater intrusion in the nb the manning roughness coefficient was assigned based on a range of water depths and varied from 0 010 at water depths greater than 10 m to 0 030 at water depths less than 2 0 m a comparison of the results between the modeled data and data collected at the eight measurement stations in the nb from february 19 to march 1 2017 showed that the water velocities modeled using the chézy manning formula of bdc were slightly more accurate than those based on the logarithmic bdc formula however the salinities modeled using the chézy manning formula were more accurate than those of the logarithmic formula three skill assessment indicators cc rmse and ss were used to quantify the model validation of the water velocity and salinity for the logarithmic bdc formula the values of cc rmse and ss were 0 77 0 31 m s and 0 70 for water velocity and 0 82 4 27 and 0 49 for salinity respectively the model simulated the tidal currents fairly well but distinctly underestimated the salinity in the nb for the chézy manning formula of bdc the values of cc rmse and ss were 0 80 0 30 m s and 0 72 for water velocity and 0 85 1 82 and 0 82 for salinity respectively the model successfully captured the tidal currents and salinity in the nb and outperformed the logarithmic bdc formula especially in salinity estimation the bdc increases when water depth decreases during ebb tide and is notably smaller in the upper reaches of the nb at the highest tidal level of spring tide based on the chézy manning formula versus the logarithmic formula during spring tide the residual water flux per unit width in the nb flows landward on the south side and seaward on the north side of the middle and lower reaches and the flow is landward in the upper reaches of the nb during neap tide the flux is smaller than that during spring tide and flows seaward in the entire nb a comparison of the results based on the chézy manning bdc formula and those based on the logarithmic bdc formula showed that the landward net water flux in the upper reaches of the nb considerably increases during spring tide additionally saltwater intrusion in the nb increases at this time especially in the upper reaches of the nb this finding is consistent with the dynamic changes in the net water flux at the transect in the upper reaches of the nb the ntwf is upstream in spring tide and downstream in neap tide moreover sso was 1 8 times larger in exp2 than in exp1 during spring tide in neap tide the ntsf is from the nb into the sb based on the logarithmic bdc formula but from the sb into the nb based on the chézy manning formula and the flux is much smaller compared to that during spring tide sso varies based on the climatological states of river discharge and wind in winter for example high river discharge and a strong northerly wind caused the model to underestimate sso and salinity at the hydrological stations in the sb based on the logarithmic bdc formula however sso and temporal variations in salinity in the sb were successfully modeled using the chézy manning formula of bdc the bdc has an important effect on sso notably it is important to adopt a suitable bdc to ensure water safety in the megalopolis of shanghai and improve the numerical forecasting accuracy of saltwater intrusion in the estuary acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science

7527,the interactions between the extremely shallow funnel shaped topography and dynamic processes in the north branch nb of the changjiang estuary produce a particular type of saltwater intrusion saltwater spillover sso from the nb into the south branch sb this dominant type of saltwater intrusion threatens the winter water supplies of reservoirs located in the estuary simulated sso was weaker than actual sso in previous studies and this problem has not been solved until now the improved ecom si model with the advection scheme hsimt tvd was applied in this study logarithmic and chézy manning formulas of the bottom drag coefficient bdc were established in the model to investigate the associated effect on saltwater intrusion in the nb modeled data and data collected at eight measurement stations located in the nb from february 19 to march 1 2017 were compared and three skill assessment indicators the correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and skill score ss of water velocity and salinity were used to quantitatively validate the model the results indicated that the water velocities modeled using the chézy manning formula of bdc were slightly more accurate than those based on the logarithmic bdc formula but the salinities produced by the latter formula were more accurate than those of the former the results showed that the bdc increases when water depth decreases during ebb tide and the results based on the chézy manning formula were smaller than those based on the logarithmic formula additionally the landward net water flux in the upper reaches of the nb during spring tide increases based on the chézy manning formula and saltwater intrusion in the nb was enhanced especially in the upper reaches of the nb at a transect in the upper reaches of the nb the net transect water flux ntwf is upstream in spring tide and downstream in neap tide and the values produced by the chézy manning formula are much larger than those based on the logarithmic formula notably sso during spring tide was 1 8 times larger based on the chézy manning formula than that based on the logarithmic formula the model underestimated sso and salinity at the hydrological stations in the sb based on the logarithmic bdc formula but successfully simulated sso and the temporal variations in salinity in the sb using the chézy manning formula of bdc keywords saltwater intrusion bottom drag coefficient numerical model skill assessment changjiang estuary 1 introduction in single channel estuaries saltwater intrusion generally develops in the along channel direction however in bifurcated estuaries lateral saltwater intrusion may be significant and can play an important role in determining the temporal variation and spatial distribution of salinity in the spring neap tidal cycle wu et al 2006 gong and shen 2011 wang et al 2012 the changjiang also known as the yangtze river is one of the largest rivers in the world the changjiang estuary has a 90 km wide river mouth and is characterized by multiple bifurcations fig 1 firstly the estuary is divided by chongming island into the south branch sb and north branch nb the sb and its lower reaches form the main channel of the changjiang and contribute to the majority of river discharge while the nb is heavily silted secondly the lower sb is bifurcated into the south channel sc and the north channel nc by changxing island and hengsha island finally the sc is bifurcated into the south passage sp and the north passage np by jiuduansha island according to water column stratification or vertical salinity structure estuaries can be divided into three categories type a salt wedge or strongly stratified type b partially mixed and type c vertically well mixed prichard 1955 cameron and prichard 1963 shen et al 2003 concluded that the nb and sb belong to the type c and the nc np and sp present as type b during spring tide and present as type a during neap tide saltwater intrusion in the changjiang estuary is mainly controlled by the river discharge and tide shen et al 2003 wu et al 2006 li et al 2010 zhu et al 2010 qiu et al 2012 but is also influenced by wind li et al 2012 topography li et al 2014 river basin and estuarine projects zhu et al 2006 qiu and zhu 2013 and sea level rise qiu and zhu 2015 river discharge is recorded at the datong gauge station which is located 620 km from the changjiang mouth discharge exhibits pronounced seasonal variations with the lowest monthly mean value of 11 200 m3s 1 in january and the highest monthly mean value of 49 700 m3s 1 in july changjiang water resources commission based on data from 1950 to 2016 the tides in the estuary exhibits semidiurnal diurnal and fortnightly spring neap signals zhu et al 2015 the natural evolution and artificial reclamation of the intertidal zone from the 1950s to 2000s has severely narrowed the upper reaches of the nb zhu and bao 2016 consequently the upper reaches of the nb have become almost orthogonal to the sb while the lower reaches have become funnel shaped the evolution of the river regime of the nb has helped to prevent runoff from entering the nb especially during the dry season was also making the tidal range larger in the nb than in the sb strong tidal forcing in the nb induces significant subtidal circulation resulting in a net landward flow when river discharge is low during spring tide wu et al 2006 xue et al 2009 this residual transport forms a type of saltwater intrusion known as saltwater spillover sso from the nb into the sb which is the most characteristic type of saltwater intrusion in the estuary during spring tide the water level rises considerably in the upper reaches of the nb due to its funnel shape leading to a massive amount of sso from the shoals into the sb only a small amount of the saltwater returns to the nb because the shoals in the upper reaches of the nb are exposed to the air during ebb tide the saltwater that is spilled into the sb is transported downstream by runoff and arrives in the middle reaches of the sb during the subsequent neap tide this process impacts dongfengxisha reservoir chenhang reservoir and qingcaosha reservoir qcsr and threatens shanghai s water supply the massive qcsr was built in 2010 along the northwestern portion of changxing island and it supplies more than 70 of the freshwater for shanghai water from the changjiang is allowed to flow into qcsr when the salinity is lower than 0 45 the salinity standard of drinking water but this operation is suspended when saltwater intrusion influences the water intake although the author s research group has conducted intensive studies of saltwater intrusion in the changjiang estuary we found that the modeled sso was weaker than the real situation especially during spring tide the mean topographic depth is 3 07 3 44 and 5 07 m here and throughout the manuscript the datum is the mean sea level of the yellow sea in the upper middle and lower reaches of the nb and tidal flats with depths of less than 2 m account for 39 23 and 32 of these reaches respectively therefore the nb is extremely shallow the bottom drag coefficient bdc determined by the law of the wall in previous studies may be unsuitable for the extremely shallow nb the bdc c d is determined by the law of the wall and the logarithmic profile can be obtained via integration batchelor 1953 1 τ b ρ c d u b u b 2 c d 1 κ ln z b z 0 2 where τ b is the bottom friction stress c d is the bdc u b is the bottom current velocity at z b z b is the height from the bottom κ is the von karman constant equal to 0 4 and z 0 is the bottom roughness which is set to 0 001 m in this study in many studies the structure of tidally induced flow in channels and embayments has been characterized as logarithmic dyer 1980 soulsby and dyer 1981 lueck 1988 the logarithmic law of bdc c d may be unsuitable for extremely shallow waters collins et al 1998 analyzed 192 current velocity datasets collected from the tidal flats of the loughor estuary swansea bay and wash bay and found that fewer than 40 of the datasets were logarithmic in character in many previous studies of extremely shallow water the bdc c d has been written based on the chézy manning formula dronkers 1964 ludwick 1975 dunbar et al 1991 bokhorst 2003 3 c d g c 2 in this equation c is the chézy coefficient which can be determined from the manning roughness coefficient n chow 1959 4 c h 6 n where h is the water depth determining the value of the manning roughness coefficient becomes the key issue in this calculation notably the manning roughness coefficient varies with depth in shallow waters ree 1981 found that the manning roughness coefficient varied with the flow depth in a large number of flume experiments based on measurement data from gauge stations along the lower reaches of the yellow river qian et al 1959 concluded that the manning roughness coefficient gradually decreased with increasing water level chow 1959 argued that an increase in flow depth would cause a decrease in the manning roughness coefficient of most open channels knight 1981 and knight et al 2009 found that the manning roughness coefficients of the conwy estuary main river severn river waiwakaiho river and tomebamba river varied significantly with water stages through field measurements notably the manning roughness coefficient exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing tidal amplitude cheng et al 1993 found that the model results achieved a best fit to field data when the value of the manning roughness coefficient was assigned based on a range of water depths saltwater intrusion can produce estuarine circulation pritchard 1956 and effect stratification simpson et al 1990 thereby influencing sediment transport producing peak estuarine turbidities geyer 1993 and degrading the quality of freshwater flowing into reservoirs in the changjiang estuary based on numerical experiments of bdc we further studied saltwater intrusion in the nb to improve the simulation accuracy of sso in this paper the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes field observations the numerical model and experiments in section 3 the effect of the bdc on saltwater intrusion in the nb as well as sso is analyzed and discussed finally conclusions are presented in

and h were 2 80 4 28 6 14 and 8 02 m respectively one bottom mounted tripod was placed at each of these stations and one boat was secured close to each tripod after the observations during the neap tide we move the tripods and boats from stations b d f and h to stations a c e and g to conduct observations during the neap middle spring tide which february 21 27 2017 fig 2a lasted approximately 6 days the mean water depths of stations a c e and g were 2 45 2 65 4 37 and 6 01 m respectively after this observation period we again moved the tripods and boats to stations b d f and h to conduct observations during the spring tide observations were collected february 27 march 1 2017 fig 2a for at least 48 h to cover 4 complete semidiurnal tidal cycles at each measurement station the tripod was mounted to the river bottom and equipped with instruments 0 2 m above the river bottom a 600 khz acoustic doppler current profiler adcp rd instruments was used to measure the current profile an optical backscatter sensor obs 3a d a instrument company was used to measure salinity temperature and turbidity and an electromagnetic current meter alec electron ics tokyo was used to measure the near bottom current of the bottom zone of the adcp the adcp worked in upward looking mode to measure the current profile at a vertical resolution of 0 25 m and ensembles of 2 min at a 1 s ping interval an obs was dragged along the stern of each boat to measure surface salinity temperature and turbidity at a sampling rate of 2 min we calibrated the obs using water samples and the calibration process indicated that the instrument worked well in addition to the measurement stations in the nb water level and surface salinity data were collected at the long term hydrologic stations red solid circles in fig 1 in the sb established by the state key laboratory of estuarine and coastal research the river discharge at the datong gauge station was approximately 13 000 m3 s during the observation period fig 2b this flow rate was slightly higher than the climatological average of 11 800 m3 s in february meteorological data were recorded by the weather station located on the chongming eastern shoal w blue solid circles in fig 1 the northerly wind and southerly wind alternated during the observation period fig 2c moreover strong wind was detected during the neap tide february 20 2017 with a maximum wind speed of 12 m s 2 2 numerical model a 3d numerical model developed by wu and zhu 2010 was used in this study it was based on the ecom si blumberg 1994 and later improved by chen et al 2001 and zhu 2003 for studies of hydrodynamics and material transport the mellor yamada level 2 5 turbulence closure module mellor and yamada 1982 with stability parameters from kantha and clayson 1994 was included zhu et al 2002 adopted a predictor corrector scheme to change the coriolis terms into a semi implicit scheme and to improve the model stability in the case of low eddy viscosity wu 2006 replaced the fixed boundary in original ecom si with a moving boundary to present the process of drying and flooding of tidal flats third order spatial interpolation at a moderate temporal resolution coupled with a tvd limiter hsimt tvd advection scheme was used in this model to solve the transport equations and prevent numerical oscillations wu and zhu 2010 this approach has been successfully used in previous studies of saltwater intrusion in the changjiang estuary wu et al 2010 li et al 2012 qiu and zhu 2013 qiu and zhu 2015 the model used sigma coordinates in the vertical direction and a non orthogonal curvilinear grid in the horizontal direction a wet dry scheme was included to describe the intertidal flat with a critical depth of 0 1 m the model domain covered all of the changjiang estuary hangzhou bay and adjacent seas from 117 5 e to 125 e longitude and 27 5 n to 33 7 n latitude fig 3 a the model grid was composed of 337 225 cells horizontally and 10 uniform σ levels vertically the minimum grid resolution was approximately 100 m in the bifurcation of the sb and nb fig 3b and approximately 200 m in the lower reaches of the nb fig 3c to effectively simulate sso the resolution was decreased to 10 km at the open boundary the integrated time step was set to 30 s derived from the naotide dataset http www miz nao ac jp the open sea boundary was driven by 16 astronomical constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 q1 mu2 nu2 t2 l2 2 n2 j1 m1 and oo1 daily river discharge recorded at datong station was used in the model as the river boundary condition wind fields which were used to calculate sea surface momentum were simulated by the weather research forecast model wrf or using data from the weather station on the chongming eastern shoal the national center for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and a temporal resolution of 6 h was used to establish the initial and boundary conditions of the wrf model the velocity and elevation were initially set to zero the initial salinity distribution was derived from the ocean atlas of the huanghai sea and east china sea hydrology editorial board for marine atlas 1992 outside the changjiang mouth and from recent data collected in the estuary because salinity dominates the density variability in the changjiang estuary the water temperature was set to a constant 10 c in the model detailed descriptions of the model configuration and validation can be found in li et al 2012 and qiu and zhu 2013 2 3 numerical experiments we performed two numerical experiments to study the effect of the bdc on saltwater intrusion in the nb numerical experiment 1 exp1 adopted the logarithmic law of the bdc written as shown in eq 2 and numerical experiment 2 exp2 used the chézy manning formula given in eq 3 based on previous studies cheng et al 1993 bokhorst 2003 knight et al 2009 the manning roughness coefficient n as expressed by eq 4 was assigned for a range of water depths in the nb the coefficient varied from 0 010 at water depths greater than 10 m to 0 030 at water depths less than 2 0 m table 1 this method was also used to validate hydrodynamic salt and heat transport in ria de aveiro lagoon dias and lopes 2006 similarly ria de aveiro lagoon is very shallow and dias also assigned manning roughness based on a range of water depths as did hilmar messal and mengelkamp 2006 when simulating an inundation process in the ziltendorfer lowland 3 results 3 1 model validation and evaluation the numerical model described above has been validated many times in the changjiang estuary and the results suggest that the model can successfully simulate the hydrodynamic processes and saltwater intrusion in the estuary wu et al 2011 li et al 2012 qiu and zhu 2013 in this section we use the data collected in the nb from february 19 to march 1 2017 to validate the model for exp1 and exp2 and determine which bdc formula better reproduced the hydrodynamic and saltwater intrusion processes the following three skill assessment indicators were used to quantify the validation of current and salinity the correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and skill score ss 5 cc x mod x mod x obs x obs x mod x mod 2 x obs x obs 2 1 2 6 rmse x mod x obs 2 n 7 ss 1 x mod x obs 2 x mod x obs x obs x obs 2 where x mod is the modeled data x obs is the observed data and x is the mean value ss is a statistical metric developed by willmott 1981 to describe the degree to which the observed deviations from the observed mean correspond to the predicted derivations from the observed mean perfect agreement between the model results and observations yields an ss of 1 0 whereas complete disagreement yields a value of 0 these metrics were also used by warner et al 2005 and li et al 2005 to evaluate the consistency between their model results and observations of the hudson river estuary and chesapeake bay because the nb is extremely shallow the effect of bottom friction is important the water velocity of the surface layer is larger than that of the bottom layer and salinity is almost vertically homogeneous we choose the water velocities surface and bottom layers and salinities of the surface layers to present their temporal variations temporal variations in the observed and modeled water velocities and salinities at stations c e and g are shown in figs 4 6 respectively the measured data indicated that the water current and salinity exhibited distinct semidiurnal variations additionally the maximum flood velocity was larger than the maximum ebb velocity and the surface velocity was larger than the bottom velocity the maximum flood velocities were approximately 2 4 2 0 and 2 1 m s in the surface layer and 1 7 1 5 and 1 6 m s in the bottom layer at stations c e and g respectively the surface salinities at flood slack were higher than those at ebb slack and salinity decreased upstream the maximum values were 7 8 19 7 and 26 5 at stations c e and g respectively by comparing the modeled and observed data we can see that the modeled water velocities in exp2 which is based on the chézy manning bdc formula were slightly more accurate than those in exp1 based on a logarithmic bdc formula however the modeled salinities improvement in exp2 exhibited considerable compared to those in exp1 the indicator scores of water velocity are summarized in table 2 in exp1 the cc at the eight stations ranged from 0 52 to 0 90 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 77 and from 0 67 to 0 90 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 77 the rmse ranged from 0 26 to 0 50 m s in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 37 m s and from 0 18 to 0 34 m s in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 26 m s and the ss ranged from 0 45 to 0 93 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 71 and from 0 44 to 0 87 in the bottom layer with a mean value 0 71 in exp2 the cc at the eight measured stations ranged from 0 60 to 0 92 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 80 and from 0 65 to 0 90 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 80 the rmse ranged from 0 24 to 0 49 m s in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 35 m s and from 0 15 to 0 38 m s in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 26 m s and the ss ranged from 0 46 to 0 93 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 73 and from 0 42 to 0 92 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 72 the mean surface and bottom values of cc rmse and ss at the eight stations were 0 77 0 31 m s and 0 70 in exp1 and 0 80 0 30 m s and 0 72 in exp2 respectively therefore the model successfully captured the tidal currents and the chézy manning formula of bdc provided better results than the logarithmic bdc formula the indicator scores of salinity are summarized in table 3 in exp1 the cc at the eight stations ranged from 0 64 to 0 93 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 83 and from 0 54 to 0 91 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 81 the rmse ranged from 0 25 to 6 73 in the surface layer with a mean value of 3 90 and from 0 34 to 8 47 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 4 64 and the ss ranged from 0 41 to 0 77 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 52 and from 0 22 to 0 70 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 47 in exp2 the cc at the eight stations ranged from 0 79 to 0 92 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 87 at surface layer and from 0 65 to 0 92 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 84 the rmse ranged from 0 13 to 3 54 in the surface layer with a mean value of 1 79 and from 0 23 to 3 29 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 1 86 and the ss ranged from 0 65 to 0 92 in the surface layer with a mean value of 0 84 and from 0 43 to 0 95 in the bottom layer with a mean value of 0 79 the mean surface and bottom values of cc rmse and ss of salinity at the eight stations were 0 82 4 27 and 0 49 in exp1 and 0 85 1 82 and 0 82 in exp2 respectively the ss was significantly higher in exp2 than in exp1 indicating that the model based on the logarithmic bdc formula underestimated salinity in the nb and the model based on the chézy manning formula of bdc successfully captured the temporal variations in salinity in the nb 3 2 mechanisms and discussion to improve the representativeness of the study we used the mean river discharge and wind in winter to simulate climatological saltwater intrusion in exp1 and exp2 and study the effects of different drag coefficients on saltwater intrusion the river discharge was set to 11 800 m3 s which was the climatological mean in january and february from 1950 to 2015 the surface wind was set to a constant northerly direction and speed of 5 m s which are approximately the mean wind conditions in winter 3 2 1 bdc the logarithmic formula of bdc is closely related to z b see formula 2 which is the height of half the bottom layer from the bottom of the model each vertical layer thickness varies with the total water depth the bdc will decrease when the total water depth increases during flood tide inserting formula 4 into formula 3 the bdc of the chézy manning formula can be written as follows 8 c d gn 2 h 3 therefore the bdc is related to water depth and the manning roughness coefficient n c d will increase when the water depth decreases the manning roughness coefficient n is dependent on water depth h table 1 and increases with decreasing h overall c d increases as h decreases the nb is extremely shallow and the tidal range is large zhu et al 2015 therefore the total water depth varies significantly with the flood and ebb tides to show the variation in the bdc with the tide we calculated the bdc distribution in exp1 and in exp2 during spring tide at the highest and lowest tidal levels fig 7 in exp1 the bdc is approximately 2 5 10 3 in most areas of the nb and approximately 3 5 10 3 in some very shallow areas at the highest tidal level fig 7a at the lowest tidal level when the nb becomes extremely shallow the bdc is approximately 4 1 10 3 in most areas of the upper and middle reaches of the nb and is slightly larger in the lower reaches of the nb compared with that at the highest tidal level fig 7c in exp2 the bdc is approximately 1 5 10 3 in most areas of the nb and approximately 3 2 10 3 in some very shallow areas at the highest tidal level fig 7b at the lowest tidal level the bdc is approximately 4 3 10 3 in most areas of the upper and middle reaches of the nb and is slightly larger in the lower reaches of the nb compared with that at the highest tidal level fig 7d therefore the bdc increases according to both the logarithmic and chézy manning formulas when the water depth decreases and the bdc values produced by the chézy manning formula are smaller than those of the logarithmic formula this difference could influence estimates of the net water flux and saltwater intrusion in the nb especially in the upper reaches of the nb 3 2 2 net water flux per unit width to describe the subtidal movements of water in the changjiang estuary we defined the instantaneous rate of water transport per unit width through a water column as follows 9 q 1 0 h v d σ then the residual net transport of water rw per unit width was calculated as follows 10 rw 1 t 0 t q dt where h is the total water depth v is the current velocity vector σ is the relative depth 0 at the surface and 1 at the bottom and t is the time period which equals one or several tidal cycles in this study six semidiurnal tidal cycles or 3 d were used as an averaging time window to remove the semidiurnal and diurnal tidal signals in exp1 during spring tide the residual water flux per unit width in the nb flows landward on the south side and seaward on the north side of the middle and lower reaches fig 8 a during neap tide the flux is smaller and flows seaward in the entire nb fig 8c in exp2 during spring tide the residual water flux per unit width still flows upstream but its magnitude is larger in the upper reaches than that in exp1 additionally the magnitude of the landward net water flux is largest in the lower reaches on the south side of the nb fig 8c during neap tide the net water flux is nearly equal to that in exp1 fig 8d the landward net water flux in the upper reaches of the nb during spring tide is evidently larger based on the chézy manning formula of the bdc than that based on the logarithmic bdc formula because the bottom friction in the former equation is much smaller than that in the latter equation 3 2 3 saltwater intrusion in exp1 during spring tide the nb is filled with highly saline water and the isohaline of 5 is close to the bifurcation of the nb and sb at the flood slack only a small area of salinity greater than 1 appears in the upper reaches of the sb suggesting that sso is weak during the spring tide fig 9 a during neap tide the salinity in the upper reaches of the nb decreases at the flood slack and no sso occurs fig 9c in exp2 the isohalines in the upper reaches of the nb move upstream compared to those in exp1 indicating that saltwater intrusion becomes stronger fig 9b moreover the area of salinity greater than 1 in the sb distinctly increases suggesting that sso occurs during neap tide only a small area of salinity greater than 1 in the sb exists along the south coast of chongming island and sso ceases fig 9d estimates of saltwater intrusion in the nb were enhanced using the logarithmic bdc formula compared to using the chézy manning formula of bdc especially in the upper reaches of the nb this finding is consistent with the dynamic variation in the net water flux discussed above 3 2 4 sso the most characteristic form of saltwater intrusion in the changjiang estuary is sso which is closely related to the saltwater intrusion in the nb we established a transect sec1 in the upper reaches of the nb near the bifurcation labeled in fig 1 to study the effect of the bdc on the water and salt fluxes through the transect the net transect water flux ntwf and net transect salt flux ntsf were calculated as follows 11 ntwf 1 t 0 t h x y ζ 0 l v n x y z t dldzdt 12 ntsf 1 t 0 t h x y ζ 0 l s v n x y z t dldzdt where ζ is the surface elevation l is the width of the transect s is the salinity and v n x y z t is the velocity component normal to the transect as shown in table 4 the ntwf is upstream in spring tide and downstream in neap tide in exp1 and exp2 but the values are much larger in exp2 than in exp1 with differences of 251 68 and 44 77 m3 s respectively this result suggests that more water is transported from the nb into the sb during spring tide and more water is transported from the sb into the nb during neap tide the ntsf varied similarly to the ntwf but the ntsf in exp2 was approximately 1 8 times higher than the value in exp1 during spring tide indicating that sso was 1 8 times higher based on the chézy manning formula of bdc than based on the logarithmic bdc formula in neap tide the ntsf is from the nb into the sb in exp1 but from the sb into the nb in exp2 and the flux is much smaller than that during spring tide the quantitative relationship of runoff and tidal range to the intensity of sso obtained by wu et al 2006 for the first time which indicates that the sso increases exponentially with the increase of tidal range and declines exponentially with the increase of runoff our model results are consistent with the conclusion of wu et al after saltwater enters the sb via sso it moves downstream under the force of runoff and influences the downstream salinity at the hydrological stations the chongxi and nanmen hydrological stations labeled in fig 1 are located on the southwest coast of chongming island and salinity there is completely due to sso wu et al 2006 li et al 2012 the salinities at the two hydrological stations are distinctly higher in exp2 than in exp1 fig 10 at chongxi hydrological station only sharp pulses of salinity exceed the salinity standard of drinking water in exp1 but salinity is higher than 0 45 more than half of the time in february in exp2 at nanmen hydrological station the salinity is slightly higher than 0 45 in some short periods and nearly lower than 0 45 in all of february in exp1 but the salinity is higher than 0 45 for approximately half of february in exp2 therefore adopting the chézy manning formula rather than the logarithmic bdc formula can overcome the issue of underestimating sso noted in previous studies as stated above we analyzed the sso based on the climatological states of river discharge and wind in winter but sso can be greatly enhanced when a cold front passes over the changjiang estuary li et al 2012 strong northerly winds could induce landward ekman water transport and strengthen sso next we present how sso responded to a strong northerly wind event from march 8 to 10 2016 with different bdc formulas the river discharge measured at datong station ranged from 16 000 to 21 000 m3 s with a mean value of 18 000 m3 s from march 1 to 15 2016 fig 11 a under normal circumstances sso would weaken when river discharge reaches 18 000 m3 s a strong northerly wind affected the estuary from march 8 to 10 2016 with a maximum wind speed of 23 m s and mean wind speed of 13 m s fig 11b the highest tidal level was predicted to occur on march 11 2016 the third day of the lunar calendar but was observed on march 9 2016 due to the strong northerly wind during the medium tide after neap tide fig 11c the strong northerly wind induced sso in the case of high river discharge and this influence was record at chongxi and nanmen hydrological stations fig 12 the results of the numerical model indicate that the model successfully hindcast sso and the temporal variations in salinity at the two hydrological stations using the chézy manning formula of bdc but underestimated the salinity when the logarithmic bdc formula was used therefore we further confirm that the bdc has an important influence on the sso in the estuary approximately 80 of freshwater in shanghai is currently taken from the reservoirs in the changjiang estuary and the most severe challenge is saltwater intrusion in winter especially sso it is important to adopt a suitable bdc to ensure water safety in the megalopolis of shanghai and improve the numerical forecasting accuracy of saltwater intrusion in the estuary 4 conclusions the nb is extremely shallow and the upper reaches of the nb are almost orthogonal to the sb additionally the lower reaches of the nb are funnel shaped the river regime of the nb helps prevent runoff from entering the nb during the dry season and makes the tidal range larger in the nb than in the sb the interaction between the topography and dynamic processes in the nb produces a special type of saltwater intrusion sso which threatens the winter water supplies of the reservoirs located in the estuary the improved ecom si model with the advection scheme hsimt tvd was applied in this study logarithmic and chézy manning bdc formulas were established in the model to investigate the associated effects on saltwater intrusion in the nb the manning roughness coefficient was assigned based on a range of water depths and varied from 0 010 at water depths greater than 10 m to 0 030 at water depths less than 2 0 m a comparison of the results between the modeled data and data collected at the eight measurement stations in the nb from february 19 to march 1 2017 showed that the water velocities modeled using the chézy manning formula of bdc were slightly more accurate than those based on the logarithmic bdc formula however the salinities modeled using the chézy manning formula were more accurate than those of the logarithmic formula three skill assessment indicators cc rmse and ss were used to quantify the model validation of the water velocity and salinity for the logarithmic bdc formula the values of cc rmse and ss were 0 77 0 31 m s and 0 70 for water velocity and 0 82 4 27 and 0 49 for salinity respectively the model simulated the tidal currents fairly well but distinctly underestimated the salinity in the nb for the chézy manning formula of bdc the values of cc rmse and ss were 0 80 0 30 m s and 0 72 for water velocity and 0 85 1 82 and 0 82 for salinity respectively the model successfully captured the tidal currents and salinity in the nb and outperformed the logarithmic bdc formula especially in salinity estimation the bdc increases when water depth decreases during ebb tide and is notably smaller in the upper reaches of the nb at the highest tidal level of spring tide based on the chézy manning formula versus the logarithmic formula during spring tide the residual water flux per unit width in the nb flows landward on the south side and seaward on the north side of the middle and lower reaches and the flow is landward in the upper reaches of the nb during neap tide the flux is smaller than that during spring tide and flows seaward in the entire nb a comparison of the results based on the chézy manning bdc formula and those based on the logarithmic bdc formula showed that the landward net water flux in the upper reaches of the nb considerably increases during spring tide additionally saltwater intrusion in the nb increases at this time especially in the upper reaches of the nb this finding is consistent with the dynamic changes in the net water flux at the transect in the upper reaches of the nb the ntwf is upstream in spring tide and downstream in neap tide moreover sso was 1 8 times larger in exp2 than in exp1 during spring tide in neap tide the ntsf is from the nb into the sb based on the logarithmic bdc formula but from the sb into the nb based on the chézy manning formula and the flux is much smaller compared to that during spring tide sso varies based on the climatological states of river discharge and wind in winter for example high river discharge and a strong northerly wind caused the model to underestimate sso and salinity at the hydrological stations in the sb based on the logarithmic bdc formula however sso and temporal variations in salinity in the sb were successfully modeled using the chézy manning formula of bdc the bdc has an important effect on sso notably it is important to adopt a suitable bdc to ensure water safety in the megalopolis of shanghai and improve the numerical forecasting accuracy of saltwater intrusion in the estuary acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science

7528,hydrosystems engineering designs involve analysis of hydrometric data e g rainfall floods and use of hydrologic hydraulic models all of which contribute various degrees of uncertainty to the design process uncertainties in hydrosystem designs can be generally categorized into aleatory and epistemic types the former arises from the natural randomness of hydrologic processes whereas the latter are due to knowledge deficiency in model formulation and model parameter specification this study shows that the presence of epistemic uncertainties induces uncertainty in determining the design capacity hence the designer needs to quantify the uncertainty features of design capacity to determine the capacity with a stipulated performance reliability under the design condition using detention basin design as an example the study illustrates a methodological framework by considering aleatory uncertainty from rainfall and epistemic uncertainties from the runoff coefficient curve number and sampling error in design rainfall magnitude the effects of including different items of uncertainty and performance reliability on the design detention capacity are examined a numerical example shows that the mean value of the design capacity of the detention basin increases with the design return period and this relation is found to be practically the same regardless of the uncertainty types considered the standard deviation associated with the design capacity when subject to epistemic uncertainty increases with both design frequency and items of epistemic uncertainty involved it is found that the epistemic uncertainty due to sampling error in rainfall quantiles should not be ignored even with a sample size of 80 relatively large for a hydrologic application the inclusion of sampling error in rainfall quantiles resulted in a standard deviation about 2 5 times higher than that considering only the uncertainty of the runoff coefficient and curve number furthermore the presence of epistemic uncertainties in the design would result in under estimation of the annual failure probability of the hydrosystem and has a discounting effect on the anticipated design return period keywords probabilistic design hydrosystems engineering uncertainty analysis aleatory and epistemic uncertainty detention basin design 1 introduction in the design and analysis of hydrosystem infrastructure a myriad of uncertainty exists that contribute to potential system failure performance reliability of the hydrosystem depends on the interaction of system capacity and imposed load both of which are subject to uncertainties uncertainties can broadly be categorized into aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty in that the former is due to inherent randomness of naturally occurring events while the latter is attributed to knowledge deficiency of the processes involved models used parameters specified etc for instance in the design of flow retardation facilities such as detention basins aleatory uncertainty is the random occurrence of runoff producing rainfall events and their amounts on the other hand epistemic uncertainties could arise from quantification of the land use characteristics soil properties rainfall runoff model as well as sampling induced error in estimating design rainfall quantiles all of which affect the accuracy of the estimated surface runoff quantity for which the design of the detention basin is based consequently the load onto a detention basin i e surface runoff volume is uncertain which would affect the performance reliability of the detention system having a specified design storage capacity it is expected that a hydrosystem with higher capacity would have a lower failure probability but the system would be more expensive uncertainty quantification reliability assessment and economic analysis have been integrated in probabilistic design risk based analysis or life cycle performance assessment of various hydrosystems examples can be found in subsurface hydrology tartakovsky 2013 for groundwater management philbrick and kitanidis 1998 acquifer remediation bolster et al 2009 and in surface hydrology for flood risk assessment apel et al 2004 and reservoir operation mediero et al 2007 some earlier probabilistic design procedures that consider only aleatory uncertainty can be found in the design of culverts corry et al 1980 bridges schneider and wilson 1980 new dams pate cornell and tagaras 1986 and the dutch delta flood defense systems vrijling 1993 cornell 1972 stipulated farsightedly that it is important in engineering applications that we avoid the tendency to model only those probabilistic aspects that we think we know how to analyze it is far better to have an approximate model of the whole problem than an exact model of only a portion of it later various other types of epistemic uncertainty were incorporated along with aleatory uncertainty in the probabilistic design and analysis of different hydrosystems uncertainties in the probability distribution model and parameters in flood frequency were considered in the design of levee systems wood 1977 bodo and unny 1976 bao et al 1987 methodologies have been developed to consider hydraulic model parameter uncertainties in the design of highway drainage structures tung and bao 1990 storm sewer systems tang et al 1975 levee systems tung and mays 1981 river diversion afshar et al 1994 rating curve estimation mcmillan and westerberg 2015 coastal flood risk mapping goda and song 2016 and design flood determination qi et al 2016 economic uncertainty in conjunction with hydrologic and hydraulic uncertainties was considered in flood damage reduction projects usace 1996 su and tung 2016 and coastal flood damage estimation de moel et al 2012 in the context of conventional probabilistic design the design frequency of a naturally occurring hydrologic load e g rainfall or flood is chosen as the basis for determining the hydrosystem capacity without considering other uncertainties and the trade off with the failure induced damage cost under this condition a unique correspondence exists between the design capacity of the hydrosystem and the design frequency further the anticipated annual failure probability can be obtained directly from the reciprocal of the chosen design frequency however when epistemic uncertainties are considered tung 2017 shows that the design capacity under the design frequency is uncertain and the determination of design capacity would require the stipulation of desired performance reliability under the design event the annual failure probability then will depend on the design frequency stipulated performance reliability and the extent of epistemic uncertainty involved this paper presents a framework to systematically assess the effects of aleatory and various types of epistemic uncertainty on the determination of hydrosystem capacity in particular epistemic uncertainties considered are hydrologic model parameters and inputs induced by sampling error an example of detention basin design is used to provide a numerical illustration of the analysis framework from that the effects of various uncertainties on sizing a detention basin can be clearly assessed 2 probabilistic based determination of design capacity of hydrosystems basically the design capacity or resistance of the hydrosystem is dictated by the desired protection level against the anticipated load design load and other involved transfer mechanisms affecting the load resistance relationship this relationship can typically be expressed as 1 r g l φ in which g transfer model for system resistance r load l and a set of model parameters φ influencing the load resistance relationship for example in the determination of flow carrying capacity r of a drainage channel the load l could be the runoff producing rainfall and the elements in φ could involve land use characteristics soil properties channel boundary roughness etc it is understood that the resistance r would be uncertain if the load l and or model parameters φ in the transfer function are subject to uncertainty in this section the conventional probabilistic based design procedure is first described for the situation when only aleatory uncertainty is considered followed by a description to treat jointly both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties 2 1 design capacity considering only aleatory uncertainty in the conventional probabilistic based design of a hydrosystem only aleatory uncertainty attributed by the naturally random occurrence of hydrologic events and their magnitudes is considered the design capacity of a hydrosystem often is determined according to a design return period or frequency chosen for the level of protection that the hydrosystem is designed to achieve referring to eq 1 the design flow carrying capacity of a drainage channel is related to the design rainfall of a stipulated return period and other rainfall runoff transforming processes as 2 r t dsgn g l t dsgn φ in which l t dsgn the design rainfall i e load associated with a stipulated design return period t dsgn r t dsgn the corresponding design flow carrying capacity i e resistance of the drainage channel determined by the rainfall runoff transfer model g involving a set of hydrologic hydraulic parameters φ which are treated as constants without uncertainty in the conventional frequency based design approach the frequency magnitude relationship of the underlying hydrologic event which characterizes the load on the hydrosystem is first established through the adoption of an appropriate probability distribution model f l ℓ the magnitude of random load l associated with the chosen design return period t dsgn can be expressed as 3 0 l t dsgn f l ℓ d ℓ f l l t dsgn 1 1 t dsgn in which f l ℓ and f l ℓ probability density function pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf respectively of hydrologic load and l t dsgn magnitude of hydrologic load corresponding to the design frequency t dsgn in theory the value of the design load corresponding the design frequency t dsgn can be obtained through the inverse cdf as 4 l t dsgn f l 1 1 1 t dsgn according to eq 2 the failure probability of the hydrosystem expressed in terms of the annual exceedance probability aep can be obtained as 5 aep p r l l t dsgn 1 t dsgn note that when only aleatory uncertainty of the load is considered the corresponding design capacity resistance of the hydrosystem determined by eq 2 has the same aep as the design load that is 6 aep p r l r t dsgn 1 t dsgn 2 2 design capacity considering both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties note that when only aleatory uncertainty is considered f l ℓ or f l ℓ in eq 3 is a univariate probability distribution describing the natural random occurrence of load onto a hydrosystem e g rainfall however when epistemic uncertainties associated with the parameters φ in the load resistance transfer model are considered they would make further contribution to the overall uncertainty of the load onto the hydrosystem under such circumstance f l ℓ in eq 3 is a univariate marginal distribution function of the load that is intrinsically related to a multivariate distribution function defined over the sample space for the elements in φ which are subjected to epistemic uncertainties the resulting design capacity r t dsgn would be uncertain with its statistical moments that can be expressed as 7 e r t dsgn m φ r k g l t dsgn φ m dh φ in which e r t dsgn m the m th order raw moment of hydrosystem capacity with design frequency t dsgn g l t dsgn φ transfer function converting design load l t dsgn into the design capacity r t dsgn and h φ a multivariate joint cdf of k uncertain model parameters φ φ 1 φ 2 φ k with epistemic uncertainty in the k dimensional sample space r k eq 7 indicates that the determination of the statistical moments of random design capacity r t dsgn induced by the epistemic uncertainty in φ involves multiple integration over a k dimensional domain application of deterministic numerical integration would be impractical when the number of variables is moderate or large and the accuracy of integration result would deteriorate rapidly with the dimensionality gould and tobochnik 1988 alternatively multi dimensional integration can be carried out for eq 7 by monte carlo integration newman and barkema 1999 in which random samples of model parameters φ s are generated the statistical moments of design capacity of any order can be approximated by averaging the values of h l t dsgn φ s m from the monte carlo repetitions as 8 e r t dsgn m i 1 n p φ s i h l t dsgn φ s i m in which φ s i the i th model parameter set in n randomly generated sample sets i e φ s i s φ and p φ s i probability of joint occurrence of the i th model parameter set by the simple random sampling in the monte carlo simulation p φ s i 1 n the computational issue with the monte carlo integration is the number of repetitions required to generate sufficient sample realizations of φ s to achieve the desired accuracy to improve the accuracy of the monte carlo integration result implementation of various variance reduction sampling procedures would be helpful law and kelton 1991 other than the monte carlo simulation several methods can also be applied to generate plausible sample realizations of model parameters to use in eq 8 in this study a probabilistic point estimation ppe method is used to generate representative sampling points φ s i in the parameter space for estimating the statistical moments of design capacity ppe methods produce special sample combinations of random parameter sets and their joint probabilities in the sample space s φ according to their probabilistic characteristics the main advantage of a ppe method is that it generally requires significantly less samples for function evaluations while preserve statistical properties of random parameters several ppe methods have been developed including two point methods rosenblueth 1981 harr 1989 three point methods li 1992 and other variations chang et al 1995 tsai and franceschini 2005 franceschini et al 2012 detail procedures for some basic ppe methods can be found in tung and yen 2005 pp 163 197 3 application to detention basin design in this section detention basin design is used to illustrate the influence of various types of epistemic uncertainties on the design storage as compared with the design storage obtained by the conventional frequency based design considering only aleatory uncertainty of rainfall the procedure integrates epistemic uncertainties in determining inflow volume produced by the inherently random rainfall specifically two categories of epistemic uncertainty are considered herein 1 uncertain parameters φ in the rainfall runoff transfer model and 2 sampling error associated with the estimation of design rainfall magnitude l t dsgn from finite rainfall sample data to illustrate the analysis procedure without being over complicated by rainfall runoff simulation and hydrograph routing the study applied the well known modified rational method chow et al 1988 to size the detention storage 3 1 sizing detention using the modified rational method under a rainstorm with a constant intensity the modified rational method assumes that the resulting inflow hydrograph to the detention basin has a simple geometric shape as shown in fig 1 3 1 1 determining design storage volume considering only aleatory uncertainty to incorporate inherent randomness of rainfall into the determination of detention basin storage a suitable rainfall intensity duration frequency idf relation is used for the urban catchment under consideration in this example the sherman 1931 rainfall idf equation is used 9 i t t d a t t d b t c t in which i t t d average rainfall intensity in hr or mm hr with return period t yr and duration td min and at bt and ct idf model coefficients whose values generally vary with return period t yr the inflow peak discharge produced by rainfall is determined by the rational formula according to the simplified inflow and outflow hydrographs shown in fig 1 the detention storage volume the shaded area required to accommodate the t yr inflow can be determined as chow et al 1988 10 s t q p t t d q a t d q a t c 1 γ 2 η 2 where s t required detention storage volume qp t inflow peak discharge resulting from t yr td min rainfall event ft3 s or m3 s

outflow peak discharge to inflow peak discharge and γ ratio of time to peak of outflow hydrograph to that of inflow γ 1 eq 10 shows that the required detention storage volume s t to accommodate runoff from a t yr rainfall is a function of rainfall duration td since storm duration is a variable it is sensible to size the detention capacity by identifying the critical storm duration td that yields the maximum storage s t that is 11 s t max t d q p t t d q a t d q a t c 1 γ 2 η 2 when c t 1 in eq 9 a proper optimization algorithm can be applied to determine s t chow et al 1988 provided a direct solution for s t under the condition of c t 1 therefore considering only random rainfall induced aleatory uncertainty the required design detention storage volume s t dsgn for the stipulated design frequency t dsgn can be obtained by solving eq 11 with t t dsgn 3 1 2 implications of epistemic uncertainties on design detention storage eq 11 shows that the t yr design detention storage volume s t is dependent on the runoff coefficient c and time of concentration tc which in turn are affected by the land use and other catchment factors affecting surface runoff production several empirical or semi empirical formulas have been applied in practice for estimating the time of concentration natural resources conservation service 2010 the formula adopted herein is the soil conservation service scs formula 12 t c l f 0 8 s 1 0 7 1140 y 0 5 where lf flow length ft y average watershed land slope and s 1000 cn 10 the maximum potential retention in with cn curve number representing flow retardance factor variability in land use vegetation cover soil characteristics including soil moisture condition and other conditions contribute to the variability in cn hjelmfelt et al 2001 and runoff coefficient c sen and altunkaynak 2006 the national engineering handbook part 630 hydrology natural resources conservation service 2004 2010 suggests treating cn as a random variable in addition to uncertainties contributed from the catchment parameters c and cn that affect runoff peak discharge qp t in eq 10 the rainfall intensity quantile of a selected frequency and duration i t t d is generally estimated from frequency analysis using finite rainfall data therefore the estimated i t t d could also be subject to uncertainty due to sampling error kite 1988 rao and hamed 2000 fig 2 is a rainfall intensity frequency relationship containing aleatory randomness of rainfall intensity horizontal axis and epistemic uncertainty in the estimated t yr rainfall quantile due to the sampling errors it can be observed that the presence of epistemic uncertainty in the rainfall quantile would result in uncertainty in rainfall load with a certain range of variation rather than simply a single value curve as shown by the solid line without epistemic uncertainty in this study epistemic uncertainties considered include the sampling error in the estimated t yr rainfall quantile i t t d and catchment runoff factors c and cn if only aleatory uncertainty is considered the design storage capacity of a detention basin can be uniquely determined once the design frequency of rainfall tdsgn is specified see the solid line of the storage frequency curve in fig 3 when epistemic uncertainties are considered this unique one to one relation between design capacity and design frequency no longer exists instead there will be uncertainty associated with the inflow volume resulting from rainfall of any return period fig 3 shows the distribution functions of maximum inflow volume f s t dsgn and f s t associated with the design frequency tdsgn and any arbitrary rainfall return period t as illustrated in fig 3 the presence of epistemic uncertainties induces uncertainty into design capacity when t tdsgn this raises a practical issue as to how the design storage capacity should be determined and on what basis for a design frequency tdsgn if the design capacity s t dsgn is taken as the nominal values of model parameters e g mean or modal values of runoff coefficient and curve number this implies that when a rainfall event with design frequency tdsgn occurs the detention basin would overflow approximately 50 of the time such a high failure probability would challenge the expectation that the design capacity of an engineering system should be able to perform satisfactorily with high performance reliability when the system is subjected to the external load defined by its design condition on the other hand to have a design capacity with zero failure probability is not realistic and would be unnecessarily expensive therefore a reasonable likelihood to anticipate unsatisfactory performance α would have to be chosen by the designer in such a manner that design storage capacity of the detention basin under the design frequency tdsgn would satisfy 13 pr s t dsgn s t dsgn α α in which s t dsgn α a deterministic constant chosen for the design storage capacity of a detention basin having a reliability a non exceedance probability of 1 α when the tdsgn yr rainfall event occurs by considering aleatory uncertainty only the exceedance probability that the runoff volume produced by any t yr rainfall event t t dsgn is larger than the design storage capacity i e pr s t dsgn s t dsgn o is dichotomous with a value of 0 for t t dsgn or 1 for t t dsgn however fig 3 shows that this is no longer the case when epistemic uncertainties exist the determination of s t dsgn α is intimately related to the notion of safety factor sf in engineering design practice when the design quantity is subject to uncertainty without epistemic uncertainty one could use the nominal model parameters φ o to obtain s t dsgn φ o as the design storage capacity however when epistemic uncertainties are considered in φ o sf with sf 1 is then used to determine the design capacity as sf s t dsgn φ o in doing so extra capacity is added beyond the nominally obtained design capacity to accommodate unexpected load due to uncertainty and or negligence in the design process the use of eq 13 provides a scientifically rational way to define the value of sf with explicit consideration given to the anticipated performance reliability of the system under the design condition i e sf s t dsgn α s t dsgn φ o 3 2 determination of detention storage capacity under epistemic uncertainty realizing that the t yr required storage volume s t is a random variable when epistemic uncertainties are considered it is essential to quantify the relevant statistical properties and distribution of s t so that the detention storage with a performance reliability of 1 α under the design condition s t dsgn α can be obtained by eq 13 for any rainfall frequency of t yr including t t dsgn the m th order moment of s t according to eq 7 can be expressed as 14 e s t m i t td c cn r 3 s t i t t d c cn m dh i t t d c cn m 1 2 in which h i t t d c cn trivariate cdf of t yr rainfall intensity i t t d of critical duration t d min runoff coefficient c and curve number cn from the raw moments the corresponding central moments of random s t can be derived for example the first three central moments of s t can be expressed in terms of raw moments as 15 mean μ s t e s t variance σ 2 s t e s t 2 μ s t 2 coeff of skewness γ s t e s t 3 3 μ s t e s t 2 2 μ s t 3 σ 3 s t in which μ s t σ 2 s t and γ s t are respectively the mean variance and coefficient of skewness of the required detention storage corresponding to the return period t yr when t tdsgn the required detention capacity is the design storage which is also a random variable under the influence of epistemic uncertainty as mentioned earlier several methods exist that are applicable to compute e s t m in this example the rosenblueth two point ppe method is applied to compute the statistical moments of the random design storage s t using the rosenblueth method the two point representation of i t t d c and cn indicated by i t t d c and cn are chosen to represent the distributional properties of the three random variables the statistical moment of design storage volume can be calculated by 16 e s t m ℓ j k p i t t d ℓ c j cn k s

moments of random design storage s t considering uncertainty features of i t t d c and cn is shown in fig 4 detailed descriptions of the rosenblueth method are given in tung and yen 2005 and are summarized in appendix a upon the determination of the statistical moments of s t dsgn a proper parametric probability distribution f s t dsgn shown in fig 3 can be selected this allows the determination of the value of design storage capacity s t dsgn α corresponding to the specified performance reliability 1 α that can be obtained as s t dsgn α f s t dsgn 1 1 α with f s t dsgn 1 s being the inverse cdf of the random design storage capacity of the detention basin s t dsgn 4 numerical example consider sizing a detention basin for an urban catchment with an area a 25 ac 8 36 ha the allowable outflow peak discharge from the detention basin is qa 18 ft3 s 0 51 m3 s and the shape of outflow hydrograph is specified in fig 1 with γ 2 the runoff coefficient c in the rational formula and the scs curve number cn are subject to uncertainty and treated as random variables with each having a triangular distribution see fig 5 the values of the lower bound nominal value mode and upper bound for c and cn are listed in table 1 along with the corresponding first three moments as suggested by natural resources conservation service 2004 curve number cnmo 85 under the normal antecedent moisture condition amc ii is taken to be the mode of the triangular distribution with lower and upper bound values respectively at dry amc i and wet amc iii conditions which can be calculated by chow et al 1988 17 cn lb cn i 4 2 cn ii 10 0 058 cn ii cn ub cn iii 23 cn ii 10 0 13 cn ii referring to table 1 the distribution function of the runoff coefficient is symmetric zero skew whereas that of the curve number is negatively skewed note that runoff coefficient c and curve number cn are two parameters with different representations of the same hydrologic effect on surface runoff production they are treated to be positively correlated variables with a correlation coefficient of 0 85 other hydrologic parameters in eq 12 for calculating the time of concentration of the catchment are treated as constants flow length l 574 5 m average land slope y 5 for this example catchment the rainfall idf eq 9 is used to characterize aleatory uncertainty associated with the natural randomness of rainfall intensity of various durations based on the rainfall idf relationship derived for the city of london canada simonovic and peck 2009 the three idf model coefficients are functionally related to return period t in yr through regression analysis as 18 a t 358 407 ln t 5 69 ln t 2 b t 3 208 2 228 ln t 0 225 ln t 2 c t 0 759 0 0318 ln t 0 0034 ln t 2 to consider the sampling error associated with the t yr td min rainfall intensity quantile i t t d from eq 9 random rainfall intensity of any given duration i t d is assumed to follow a gumbel distribution having a cdf 19 f i t d exp exp β t d i t d ξ t d where ξ t d and β t d 0 are the location and scale parameters respectively for random td min rainfall intensity several methods can be used to estimate the distribution parameters kite 1988 rao and hamed 2000 in this study the method of moments mom is used to calculate the standard errors of the gumbel t yr td min rainfall quantile i t t d the standard error s e i t t d is a function of the record length n and return period t and scale parameter β t d the mom based variance for the gumbel t yr td min quantile can be obtained as kite 1988 20 s e 2 i

the city of london canada the optimal gumbel ev1 distribution parameters ξ t d and β t d are determined to fit individual intensity frequency relations of different durations and the corresponding mean and standard deviation are calculated accordingly as shown in fig 6 the two gumbel distribution parameters reveal well behaved relationships with rainfall duration based on the data listed in table 2 the following two functional relations for the ev1 parameters with rainfall duration are obtained 21a ln ξ td 5 4752 0 4888 ln t d 0 02408 ln t d 2 s e 0 0321 r 2 0 9996 21b ln β t d 3 955 0

coefficients in eqs 21a b are highly relevant with the corresponding p values significantly smaller than 5 ev1 scale parameter β t d of a specified duration td obtained by eq 21b along with the sample size n can be used in eq 20 to compute the uncertainty associated with the t yr td min rainfall quantile s e 2 i t t d induced by the sampling error under n 80 a plot of series of curves of the standard error of the ev1 based rainfall intensity quantile with respect to duration and frequency is shown in fig 7 it is interesting to observe that this set of curves is closely parallel to each other and their functional relationship with the rainfall duration td can be represented through regression analysis by 22 ln s e 2 i t t d w t 0 0786 ln t d 2 where the constant w t is dependent on the return period t through regression analysis the values of w t affected by the return period t are listed below t yr 2 5 10 25 50 100 wt 1 5257 2 0469 2 3475 2 6464 2 8259 2 9785 which can be represented by a functional relation between wt and return period as 23 w t 1 0474 0 7636 ln t 0 10025 ln t 2 0 005563 ln t 3 with se 0 0080 and r 2 0 9999 eq 22 along with eq 23 can be used to determine the sampling error induced variance associated with the ev1 based t yr td min rainfall intensity quantile at the site with record length of n 80 years 4 1 sizing detention basin storage considering only aleatory uncertainty following the conventional design procedure detention basin capacity to accommodate the inflow hydrograph produced by the t yr rainfall intensity can be obtained by solving for s t from eq 11 along with the critical rainfall duration t d listed in row 2 of table 3 row 1 and 3 of the table define a unique storage frequency relationship under the conventional design procedure in which only aleatory uncertainty due to natural randomness of rainfall is considered 4 2 sizing detention storage considering aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty the required detention storage capacity s t with the critical rainfall duration t d can be obtained by solving eq 11 for the selected return period t however s t is a function of inflow peak discharge qp t and time of concentration tc which in turn are both random variables because the former is dependent on uncertain c while the latter on uncertain cn furthermore epistemic uncertainty due to sampling error associated with the estimated rainfall quantile i t t d also exists which contributes to the overall uncertainty in the determination of detention basin capacity the presence of epistemic uncertainties induces uncertainty in the design capacity associated with the design frequency therefore s t corresponding to any specified rainfall frequency t is a random variable by further incorporating sampling error in estimating the rainfall intensity quantile jointly with the uncertainty in c and cn the statistical moments for the required detention storage capacity s t can be obtained using eq 16 which is graphically represented in fig 4 by the event tree diagram 4 2 1 epistemic uncertainty in c and cn without considering sampling error associated with the t yr rainfall intensity quantile the consideration of uncertainty in c and cn covers only the 2nd and 3rd sub layers of the event tree in fig 4 based on the statistical properties of c and cn four representative points in the c cn domain and their corresponding joint probability mass can be determined by the rosenblueth two point method see table 4 the scs storage parameter s and the time of concentration tc corresponding to the four selected points are listed in the last two columns conditioned on the specific pair of c cn and its corresponding s and tc in table 4 the required detention basin capacity corresponding to the t yr rainfall s t and the corresponding critical rainfall duration td can be obtained from solving eq 11 the critical rainfall duration the corresponding rainfall intensity i t t d inflow peak discharge qp t and the required detention storages of different return periods s t conditioned on the four pairs of c cn listed in table 4 are summarized in table 5 a calculate statistical moments of design detention capacity s t dsgn fig 3 has shown that the presence of epistemic uncertainties induces uncertainty in the inflow volume to the detention basin for a specified design frequency tdsgn upon the selection of the design storage capacity for the tdsgn there still could exist a small probability α that random design inflow s t dsgn could exceed the design capacity s t dsgn α resulting in overflow to determine s t dsgn α it is necessary to calculate the statistical properties of the random s t dsgn and identify or assume its distribution function based on the conditional values of s t c cn corresponding to a pair of c cn listed in table 5 and their associated joint probability p c cn in table 4 the unconditional raw moments of random s t can be computed by 24 e s t dsgn m j k p c j cn k s t dsgn c j cn k m for m 1 2 3 from the raw moments the formulas to compute the corresponding central moments such as eq 15 can be found in many standard statistics textbooks if desired statistical moments of any order for the other design parameters listed in table 5 can also be calculated in the same manner for illustration the raw moments and the corresponding central moments of random s t are listed in table 6 as expected the unconditional mean of the required detention storage increases with the return period interestingly the values of standard deviation and coefficient of variation also increase with the rainfall frequency table 6 also shows that the values of the skewness coefficient of s t for all return periods are negative and the degree of asymmetry decreases with the return period with the exception of t 2 yr and 5 yr the skewness coefficient of required detention storage is very close to zero and therefore a normal distribution is quite justifiable to use herein to determine the design storage capacity s t dsgn α under different design frequencies with a stipulated performance reliability of 1 α for α 0 1 the corresponding values of s t α 0 1 with the reliability of 1 α 0 9 can be calculated according to eq 13 based on the normality condition the design capacity with 90 reliability can be determined as 25 s t α 0 1 μ s t φ 1 0 9 σ s t μ s t 1 2816 σ s t the results are given at the bottom row of table 6 it should be pointed out that the calculations done herein on the basis of normality are reasonably accurate but would somewhat over estimate the design capacity for 2 yr and 5 yr events because they are more negatively skewed b calculate conditional and annual overflow probabilities with reference to tdsgn referring to fig 3 the conditional overflow probability of inflow volume of any frequency t with reference to the detention capacity of a specified design frequency tdsgn and reliability 1 α can be calculated as 26 p r s t s t dsgn α t dsgn α d g s t in which d g s t g s t d s t with g s t being the probability density function of required detention storage s t to accommodate runoff produced by the t yr td min rainfall table 7 lists the conditional overflow probability p r s t s t dsgn α for a detention basin having storage capacity corresponding to the design frequency tdsgn in column wise with 1 α 0 9 reliability s t dsgn α 0 1 under the condition of varying rainstorm frequencies t in row wise the column s quo stands for status quo representing the condition of no detention expectedly without a detention facility this conditional overflow probability is unity for any storm frequency also since the design capacity s t dsgn α 0 1 is set at 1 α 0 9 the t yr storm is expect to have the overflow probability of α 0 1 when t tdsgn as underlined however the presence of epistemic uncertainties shown in fig 3 implies that this overflow probability is not necessarily equal to 1 0 when t tdsgn or equal to zero when t tdsgn under the normality condition for s t the conditional overflow probability can be easily computed as 27 p r s t s t dsgn α 1 φ s t dsgn α μ s t σ s t this is illustrated in the columns associated with tdsgn 25 yr in that the detention capacity designed on the basis of a lower return period can have some likelihood to accommodate runoff produced by rainstorms with higher return periods to determine the annual overflow probability aop of the detention facility one can integrate the conditional overflow probability under a specified design frequency tdsgn over the occurrence frequency of storm defined by the aleatory uncertainty of random rainfall as 28 aop s t dsgn α 1 p r s t s t dsgn α 1 t 2 dt 0 1 p r s t s t dsgn α df in which aop s t dsgn α is the annual overflow probability of the detention basin having a design capacity s t dsgn α f 1 1 t and f dsgn 1 1 t d s g n referring to eq 28 the last row of table 7 lists the aop for each design frequency tdsgn which are obtained by integrating over the range of storm frequencies listed in the 1st column the aop is identical to the aep defined in eq 6 it can be seen in table 7 that the annual overflow probabilities are lower than the nominal value of 1 tdsgn when the design exceedance probability is set at α 0 1 it is expected that the aop would be lower than the nominal overflow probability as the value of α gets smaller because a larger safety factor is used in determining the design capacity s t dsgn α the effect of α on aop is presented in section 4 3 4 2 2 considering epistemic uncertainty in c cn and rainfall quantiles when considering sampling error associated with the rainfall intensity quantile see fig 4 the t yr td min rainfall intensity quantile i t t d is treated as a normal random variable with the mean obtained from the rainfall idf eq 9 and the standard deviation equaling the corresponding standard error s e i t t d calculated by eq 22 in conjunction with eq 23 a statistical properties of detention basin storage volume random rainfall intensity quantile i t t d can be treated as statistically independent of random watershed characteristics c cn the normality assumption of i t t d renders equal probability allocation of 0 5 to the two points of i t t d s e i t t d by using the rosenblueth method as shown in fig 4 the joint probability of each branch of the tree can be determined as t d 29 p i t t d ℓ c j cn k p i t t d ℓ p c j cn k 0 5 p c j cn k for ℓ j k or in which p c j cn k joint probability of a particular pair of c cn listed in table 4 for an example p i t t d c cn 0 5 p c cn 0 5 0 0777 0 0389 in which p c cn 0 0777 is given in table 4 based on the information in table 4 one s t can obtain the needed parameters for detention design such as critical rainfall duration runoff peak q p t and the required detention storage s t under the condition of two representative rainfall intensity values defined by for the selected rainfall frequency of interest for example under the rainfall intensity quantile i t t d i t t d s e i t t d table 8 lists the design parameters for sizing the detention basin considering four pairs of c cn which include the critical rainfall duration the corresponding rainfall intensity peak inflow and required detention basin capacity obtainable from solving eq 11 table 8 represents the upper half of the event tree shown in fig 4 similar calculations can be made on the lower half of the tree under the rainfall intensity quantile of i t t d i t t d s e i t t d like the procedure presented in 4 2 1 a statistical properties of random design capacity s t dsgn are obtained to determine the size of detention basin s t dsgn α of a specified reliability 1 α because sampling error associated with the t yr td min rainfall quantile i t t d is independent of c and cn the m th order unconditional raw moments of random by considering three types of epistemic uncertainty according to eq 16 can be rewritten as 30 e s t m ℓ p i t t d ℓ j k p c j cn k s t c j cn k i t t d ℓ m ℓ p i t t d ℓ e s t c cn i t t d ℓ m where e s t c cn i t t d ℓ m is the conditional m th order moment of required detention storage s t to accommodate inflow produced by rainfall i t t d ℓ that can be obtained in a similar manner as eq 24 from the unconditional raw moments of different orders eq 15 can be used to compute the corresponding central moments by considering three types epistemic uncertainties table 9 lists the central moments of random s t under different rainfall frequencies similar to the case of considering uncertainty in c cn the unconditional mean standard deviation and skewness coefficient of required detention storage increases with the rainfall frequency table 9 also shows that the values of the skewness coefficient of s t for all return periods but t 2 yr are positive and the degree of asymmetry more or less stays constant with return period and is close to zero hence a normal distribution is quite suitable to use to determine the design storage capacity s t dsgn α as eq 25 under different design rainfall frequencies with the performance reliability of 1 α b conditional and annual overflow probabilities with reference to tdsgn upon the determination of design capacity s t dsgn α the conditional overflow probability of inflow volume of any frequency t exceeding the design capacity can be calculated using eq 26 according to the statistical properties of the required storage volume s t under the t yr rainfall listed in table 9 under the normality condition this probability can be obtained from eq 27 the results listed in table 10 correspond to design capacity s t dsgn α 0 1 with a 90 performance reliability the conditional overflow probability under a specified design frequency tdsgn over the occurrence frequency of rainstorms defining the aleatory uncertainty can also be determined by eqs 26 or 27 table 10 shows that the annual overflow probabilities in last row are lower than the nominal value of 1 tdsgn when the failure probability under the design condition is set at α 0 1 last row it is expected that the aop would be lower than the nominal aop as the value of α gets smaller because the corresponding safety factor used in determining the design capacity s t dsgn α is larger 4 3 effects of uncertainty on detention basin design capacity and performance based on the foregoing analysis one can make quantitative assessment of the effect of various uncertainties on the detention basin capacity fig 8 shows a comparison of the mean and standard deviation of required detention storage s t to accommodate runoff produced by t yr rainfall under different types of uncertainty based on the results listed in tables 6 and 9 in the figure a stands for aleatory uncertainty ep θ stands for epistemic uncertainty involving θ which includes runoff coefficient c curve number cn and rainfall intensity quantile rain i t t d notice that the mean value curves of s t are practically identical under all conditions however the corresponding standard deviation curves diff s t dsgn α er significantly depending on the type of epistemic uncertainty considered as expected the standard deviation of s t increases with number of design parameters subject to epistemic uncertainty in this example σ s t under the consideration of epistemic uncertainty c cn rain is about 2 5 times that of considering c cn even under the assumed rainfall record length of n 80 fig 9 shows a comparison of under different types of epistemic uncertainty and desired performance reliability p s 1 α of 90 and 50 as shown in the figure the three curves corresponding to p s 50 are nearly identical because the three conditions yield almost the same average design detention storage at p s 90 the s t dsgn α 0 1 curve under a ep c cn rain as expected is higher than that under a ep c cn because the standard deviation σ s t dsgn under the former condition is larger as shown in fig 8 the magnitude of design storage capacity considering epistemic uncertainty increases with desired reliability 1 α which corresponds to a larger factor of safety for other reliability levels the design detention capacity under two different uncertainty considerations are listed in table 11 information contained in table 11 also includes aop and its equivalent return period ert defined by ert 1 aop the aop corresponding to s t dsgn α under different types of uncertainty t dsgn and reliability are calculated using eq 28 it is observed that when considering epistemic uncertainty and α 0 5 the aop of s t dsgn α corresponding to a design frequency t dsgn is lower than the nominal aop i e 1 t dsgn considering only aleatory uncertainty and this aop decreases as the reliability requirement 1 α increases in other words by considering epistemic uncertainty the design detention storage capacity in this example reveals that for α 0 5 31 aop s t dsgn α 1 t dsgn or ert s t dsgn α t dsgn whereas for α 0 5 the above inequality relation is reversed another useful assessment of the uncertainty effect on the design of a detention basin here is to compare the anticipated performance indicators under the condition of a given uncertainty type when the system is subject to a different type of uncertainty condition for example the aop or ert listed in table 11 are obtained under the uncertainty and reliability consideration listed in each block of the first two columns some useful insights are gained by quantifying the values of aop or ert under one type of uncertainty consideration when the detention basin is subject to the other condition of uncertainty referring to table 12 case i lists the value of aop for the detention capacity corresponding to the design frequency considering aleatory only these results simply equal the reciprocal of the design frequency by comparing case ii a ii b with case i it is clearly observed as expected that the incorporation of epistemic uncertainties will result in a higher aop value than for the case considering only aleatory uncertainty black line in fig 9 and the corresponding ert is lower for instance the anticipated 10 yr design considering aleatory uncertainty actually has 8 38 yr return period when the situation is under case ii a i e epistemic uncertainty in c cn are considered a comparison of cases ii a and ii b in table 12 also reveals an interesting observation that is incorporation of more epistemic uncertainties may not necessarily result in a higher aop or lower ert as generally expected fig 10 shows that for 2 yr t dsgn 25 yr the values of aop are higher under case ii a a s t ep c cn red line than those of under case ii b a s t ep c cn rain blue line however for 50 yr t dsgn 100 yr the results are reversed according to the general expectation this can be explained by the fact that computation of aop involves the integration of conditional exceedance probability p r s t s t dsgn over the domain of random rainfall as shown by eq 28 although fig 7 clearly shows that consideration of more epistemic uncertainty leads to a higher standard deviation in detention storage capacity associated with a design frequency this does not necessary correspond to higher conditional exceedance probability leading to higher aop another plausible explanation of this phenomenon might refer to eq 20 with n 80 yr the sampling error associated with the rainfall quantile i t dsgn t d with t dsgn 25 yr would not be sufficiently large enough to make visible addition to the overall uncertainty of the design capacity beyond that c and cn have made on the other hand when t dsgn approaches the record length and gets larger the sampling error in the rainfall quantile would become sufficiently large to contribute the overall uncertainty of design capacity the corresponding aop would become higher to examine the detention performance under the design of different reliability requirements and epistemic uncertainty c cn when the system actually is subject to epistemic uncertainty of c cn rain one can compare the aop and ert of case iii in table 12 with those in case ii in table 11 it can be observed in fig 11 that the values of aop of detention capacity designed under the consideration of c cn is lower than those when the sampling error induced epistemic uncertainty in rainfall quantile actually is considered the amount of underestimation of aop without considering the sampling error in rainfall quantile even with about 80 years of data can vary for t dsgn 2 yr 100 yr from 20 to 30 15 28 10 24 and 0 16 with performance reliability requirement ps 90 80 70 and 50 respectively fig 11 shows that with ps 90 the design capacity considering epistemic uncertainty c cn would result in a lower aop solid red line than the notional design aop value black line however if the reality is that epistemic uncertainty also includes sampling error in the rainfall quantile the actual aop would be as high as the notional aop dotted red line in other words the safety factor provided in the design with a 90 reliability requirement considering epistemic uncertainty in c cn would almost be completely cancelled out by the uncertainty due to sampling error in the rainfall quantile with a lower reliability requirement omitting sampling error in the rainfall quantiles could result in actual aop values that are higher than anticipated as shown by the dotted curves of different colors in fig 11 that lie above the solid black line 5 summary and conclusions uncertainties in hydrosystems design and analysis can be categorized into two types namely aleatory and epistemic the former arises from the natural randomness of hydrologic processes whereas the latter are due to knowledge deficiency in model usage including its structure and parameter specifications the conventional frequency based design approach considers aleatory uncertainty from natural random variability with which one can establish a one to one relation between design capacity and design return period once the design frequency is stipulated the design capacity of the hydrosystem is uniquely determined however the reality is that both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties exist this study shows that the presence of epistemic uncertainties introduces uncertainty into design capacity it implies two things 1 the design capacity is a random variable and the engineer needs to quantify its uncertainty features and 2 the designer has to determine the magnitude of design capacity by stipulating his her anticipated performance reliability when the system is subject to the design load condition depending on the complexity of the problem a number of ways can be implemented for probabilistic design of hydrosystems considering aleatory and epistemic uncertainties this paper presents a viable framework using a probabilistic point estimation method to quantify uncertainty features of design capacity under the condition of design frequency and loads of other frequencies through an example of detention basin design using the modified rational method the paper illustrates the methodological framework by considering aleatory uncertainty from rainfall and epistemic uncertainties from runoff coefficient curve number and sampling error in design rainfall quantile furthermore effects of including different items of uncertainty and performance reliability on the design detention capacity are examined it is observed that the mean value of the design capacity of the detention basin increases with the design return period and interestingly this relation is practically the same under the consideration of different types of uncertainty expectedly the standard deviation associated with the design capacity when subject to epistemic uncertainty increases with both design frequency and items of epistemic uncertainty considered it is worth noting that the epistemic uncertainty due to sampling error in the rainfall quantile should not be ignored in the detention basin example presented herein the standard deviation of design capacity considering sampling error in the rainfall quantile even with a sample size of 80 is about 2 5 times higher than that without considering it under the consideration of certain items of epistemic uncertainty the magnitude of design capacity increase with the required performance reliability furthermore when considering more items of epistemic uncertainty the magnitude of design capacity corresponding to a performance reliability is larger than that of considering less items of epistemic uncertainty because the former produces higher value of the standard deviation with reference to aleatory uncertainty further inclusion of epistemic uncertainty would lead to a higher annual failure probability than the nominal value expected in other words for a hydrosystem with capacity designed under the design frequency of tdsgn the actual annual exceedance probability will be higher than its expected value of 1 tdsgn i e the actual equivalent return period is lower than tdsgn when epistemic uncertainties are considered the detention basin example used herein showed that the annual overflow probability without considering epistemic uncertainties could be under estimated by 10 40 depending on the design frequency and items of epistemic uncertainty considered it is also interesting to note one thing namely the inclusion of more items of epistemic uncertainty results in higher standard deviation in design capacity but it does not necessarily lead to a higher annual failure probability for the hydrosystem than obtained when considering less items of epistemic uncertainty as normally expected this is because of the nonlinear relation among annual failure probability statistical moments of design capacity stipulated performance reliability and the design frequency under consideration in this regard one would have to carry out the failure probability calculations under different items of epistemic uncertainty to evaluate their effects on the system performance acknowledgments this study is supported by the joint research under the national research foundation korea ministry of science technology taiwan

7528,hydrosystems engineering designs involve analysis of hydrometric data e g rainfall floods and use of hydrologic hydraulic models all of which contribute various degrees of uncertainty to the design process uncertainties in hydrosystem designs can be generally categorized into aleatory and epistemic types the former arises from the natural randomness of hydrologic processes whereas the latter are due to knowledge deficiency in model formulation and model parameter specification this study shows that the presence of epistemic uncertainties induces uncertainty in determining the design capacity hence the designer needs to quantify the uncertainty features of design capacity to determine the capacity with a stipulated performance reliability under the design condition using detention basin design as an example the study illustrates a methodological framework by considering aleatory uncertainty from rainfall and epistemic uncertainties from the runoff coefficient curve number and sampling error in design rainfall magnitude the effects of including different items of uncertainty and performance reliability on the design detention capacity are examined a numerical example shows that the mean value of the design capacity of the detention basin increases with the design return period and this relation is found to be practically the same regardless of the uncertainty types considered the standard deviation associated with the design capacity when subject to epistemic uncertainty increases with both design frequency and items of epistemic uncertainty involved it is found that the epistemic uncertainty due to sampling error in rainfall quantiles should not be ignored even with a sample size of 80 relatively large for a hydrologic application the inclusion of sampling error in rainfall quantiles resulted in a standard deviation about 2 5 times higher than that considering only the uncertainty of the runoff coefficient and curve number furthermore the presence of epistemic uncertainties in the design would result in under estimation of the annual failure probability of the hydrosystem and has a discounting effect on the anticipated design return period keywords probabilistic design hydrosystems engineering uncertainty analysis aleatory and epistemic uncertainty detention basin design 1 introduction in the design and analysis of hydrosystem infrastructure a myriad of uncertainty exists that contribute to potential system failure performance reliability of the hydrosystem depends on the interaction of system capacity and imposed load both of which are subject to uncertainties uncertainties can broadly be categorized into aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty in that the former is due to inherent randomness of naturally occurring events while the latter is attributed to knowledge deficiency of the processes involved models used parameters specified etc for instance in the design of flow retardation facilities such as detention basins aleatory uncertainty is the random occurrence of runoff producing rainfall events and their amounts on the other hand epistemic uncertainties could arise from quantification of the land use characteristics soil properties rainfall runoff model as well as sampling induced error in estimating design rainfall quantiles all of which affect the accuracy of the estimated surface runoff quantity for which the design of the detention basin is based consequently the load onto a detention basin i e surface runoff volume is uncertain which would affect the performance reliability of the detention system having a specified design storage capacity it is expected that a hydrosystem with higher capacity would have a lower failure probability but the system would be more expensive uncertainty quantification reliability assessment and economic analysis have been integrated in probabilistic design risk based analysis or life cycle performance assessment of various hydrosystems examples can be found in subsurface hydrology tartakovsky 2013 for groundwater management philbrick and kitanidis 1998 acquifer remediation bolster et al 2009 and in surface hydrology for flood risk assessment apel et al 2004 and reservoir operation mediero et al 2007 some earlier probabilistic design procedures that consider only aleatory uncertainty can be found in the design of culverts corry et al 1980 bridges schneider and wilson 1980 new dams pate cornell and tagaras 1986 and the dutch delta flood defense systems vrijling 1993 cornell 1972 stipulated farsightedly that it is important in engineering applications that we avoid the tendency to model only those probabilistic aspects that we think we know how to analyze it is far better to have an approximate model of the whole problem than an exact model of only a portion of it later various other types of epistemic uncertainty were incorporated along with aleatory uncertainty in the probabilistic design and analysis of different hydrosystems uncertainties in the probability distribution model and parameters in flood frequency were considered in the design of levee systems wood 1977 bodo and unny 1976 bao et al 1987 methodologies have been developed to consider hydraulic model parameter uncertainties in the design of highway drainage structures tung and bao 1990 storm sewer systems tang et al 1975 levee systems tung and mays 1981 river diversion afshar et al 1994 rating curve estimation mcmillan and westerberg 2015 coastal flood risk mapping goda and song 2016 and design flood determination qi et al 2016 economic uncertainty in conjunction with hydrologic and hydraulic uncertainties was considered in flood damage reduction projects usace 1996 su and tung 2016 and coastal flood damage estimation de moel et al 2012 in the context of conventional probabilistic design the design frequency of a naturally occurring hydrologic load e g rainfall or flood is chosen as the basis for determining the hydrosystem capacity without considering other uncertainties and the trade off with the failure induced damage cost under this condition a unique correspondence exists between the design capacity of the hydrosystem and the design frequency further the anticipated annual failure probability can be obtained directly from the reciprocal of the chosen design frequency however when epistemic uncertainties are considered tung 2017 shows that the design capacity under the design frequency is uncertain and the determination of design capacity would require the stipulation of desired performance reliability under the design event the annual failure probability then will depend on the design frequency stipulated performance reliability and the extent of epistemic uncertainty involved this paper presents a framework to systematically assess the effects of aleatory and various types of epistemic uncertainty on the determination of hydrosystem capacity in particular epistemic uncertainties considered are hydrologic model parameters and inputs induced by sampling error an example of detention basin design is used to provide a numerical illustration of the analysis framework from that the effects of various uncertainties on sizing a detention basin can be clearly assessed 2 probabilistic based determination of design capacity of hydrosystems basically the design capacity or resistance of the hydrosystem is dictated by the desired protection level against the anticipated load design load and other involved transfer mechanisms affecting the load resistance relationship this relationship can typically be expressed as 1 r g l φ in which g transfer model for system resistance r load l and a set of model parameters φ influencing the load resistance relationship for example in the determination of flow carrying capacity r of a drainage channel the load l could be the runoff producing rainfall and the elements in φ could involve land use characteristics soil properties channel boundary roughness etc it is understood that the resistance r would be uncertain if the load l and or model parameters φ in the transfer function are subject to uncertainty in this section the conventional probabilistic based design procedure is first described for the situation when only aleatory uncertainty is considered followed by a description to treat jointly both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties 2 1 design capacity considering only aleatory uncertainty in the conventional probabilistic based design of a hydrosystem only aleatory uncertainty attributed by the naturally random occurrence of hydrologic events and their magnitudes is considered the design capacity of a hydrosystem often is determined according to a design return period or frequency chosen for the level of protection that the hydrosystem is designed to achieve referring to eq 1 the design flow carrying capacity of a drainage channel is related to the design rainfall of a stipulated return period and other rainfall runoff transforming processes as 2 r t dsgn g l t dsgn φ in which l t dsgn the design rainfall i e load associated with a stipulated design return period t dsgn r t dsgn the corresponding design flow carrying capacity i e resistance of the drainage channel determined by the rainfall runoff transfer model g involving a set of hydrologic hydraulic parameters φ which are treated as constants without uncertainty in the conventional frequency based design approach the frequency magnitude relationship of the underlying hydrologic event which characterizes the load on the hydrosystem is first established through the adoption of an appropriate probability distribution model f l ℓ the magnitude of random load l associated with the chosen design return period t dsgn can be expressed as 3 0 l t dsgn f l ℓ d ℓ f l l t dsgn 1 1 t dsgn in which f l ℓ and f l ℓ probability density function pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf respectively of hydrologic load and l t dsgn magnitude of hydrologic load corresponding to the design frequency t dsgn in theory the value of the design load corresponding the design frequency t dsgn can be obtained through the inverse cdf as 4 l t dsgn f l 1 1 1 t dsgn according to eq 2 the failure probability of the hydrosystem expressed in terms of the annual exceedance probability aep can be obtained as 5 aep p r l l t dsgn 1 t dsgn note that when only aleatory uncertainty of the load is considered the corresponding design capacity resistance of the hydrosystem determined by eq 2 has the same aep as the design load that is 6 aep p r l r t dsgn 1 t dsgn 2 2 design capacity considering both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties note that when only aleatory uncertainty is considered f l ℓ or f l ℓ in eq 3 is a univariate probability distribution describing the natural random occurrence of load onto a hydrosystem e g rainfall however when epistemic uncertainties associated with the parameters φ in the load resistance transfer model are considered they would make further contribution to the overall uncertainty of the load onto the hydrosystem under such circumstance f l ℓ in eq 3 is a univariate marginal distribution function of the load that is intrinsically related to a multivariate distribution function defined over the sample space for the elements in φ which are subjected to epistemic uncertainties the resulting design capacity r t dsgn would be uncertain with its statistical moments that can be expressed as 7 e r t dsgn m φ r k g l t dsgn φ m dh φ in which e r t dsgn m the m th order raw moment of hydrosystem capacity with design frequency t dsgn g l t dsgn φ transfer function converting design load l t dsgn into the design capacity r t dsgn and h φ a multivariate joint cdf of k uncertain model parameters φ φ 1 φ 2 φ k with epistemic uncertainty in the k dimensional sample space r k eq 7 indicates that the determination of the statistical moments of random design capacity r t dsgn induced by the epistemic uncertainty in φ involves multiple integration over a k dimensional domain application of deterministic numerical integration would be impractical when the number of variables is moderate or large and the accuracy of integration result would deteriorate rapidly with the dimensionality gould and tobochnik 1988 alternatively multi dimensional integration can be carried out for eq 7 by monte carlo integration newman and barkema 1999 in which random samples of model parameters φ s are generated the statistical moments of design capacity of any order can be approximated by averaging the values of h l t dsgn φ s m from the monte carlo repetitions as 8 e r t dsgn m i 1 n p φ s i h l t dsgn φ s i m in which φ s i the i th model parameter set in n randomly generated sample sets i e φ s i s φ and p φ s i probability of joint occurrence of the i th model parameter set by the simple random sampling in the monte carlo simulation p φ s i 1 n the computational issue with the monte carlo integration is the number of repetitions required to generate sufficient sample realizations of φ s to achieve the desired accuracy to improve the accuracy of the monte carlo integration result implementation of various variance reduction sampling procedures would be helpful law and kelton 1991 other than the monte carlo simulation several methods can also be applied to generate plausible sample realizations of model parameters to use in eq 8 in this study a probabilistic point estimation ppe method is used to generate representative sampling points φ s i in the parameter space for estimating the statistical moments of design capacity ppe methods produce special sample combinations of random parameter sets and their joint probabilities in the sample space s φ according to their probabilistic characteristics the main advantage of a ppe method is that it generally requires significantly less samples for function evaluations while preserve statistical properties of random parameters several ppe methods have been developed including two point methods rosenblueth 1981 harr 1989 three point methods li 1992 and other variations chang et al 1995 tsai and franceschini 2005 franceschini et al 2012 detail procedures for some basic ppe methods can be found in tung and yen 2005 pp 163 197 3 application to detention basin design in this section detention basin design is used to illustrate the influence of various types of epistemic uncertainties on the design storage as compared with the design storage obtained by the conventional frequency based design considering only aleatory uncertainty of rainfall the procedure integrates epistemic uncertainties in determining inflow volume produced by the inherently random rainfall specifically two categories of epistemic uncertainty are considered herein 1 uncertain parameters φ in the rainfall runoff transfer model and 2 sampling error associated with the estimation of design rainfall magnitude l t dsgn from finite rainfall sample data to illustrate the analysis procedure without being over complicated by rainfall runoff simulation and hydrograph routing the study applied the well known modified rational method chow et al 1988 to size the detention storage 3 1 sizing detention using the modified rational method under a rainstorm with a constant intensity the modified rational method assumes that the resulting inflow hydrograph to the detention basin has a simple geometric shape as shown in fig 1 3 1 1 determining design storage volume considering only aleatory uncertainty to incorporate inherent randomness of rainfall into the determination of detention basin storage a suitable rainfall intensity duration frequency idf relation is used for the urban catchment under consideration in this example the sherman 1931 rainfall idf equation is used 9 i t t d a t t d b t c t in which i t t d average rainfall intensity in hr or mm hr with return period t yr and duration td min and at bt and ct idf model coefficients whose values generally vary with return period t yr the inflow peak discharge produced by rainfall is determined by the rational formula according to the simplified inflow and outflow hydrographs shown in fig 1 the detention storage volume the shaded area required to accommodate the t yr inflow can be determined as chow et al 1988 10 s t q p t t d q a t d q a t c 1 γ 2 η 2 where s t required detention storage volume qp t inflow peak discharge resulting from t yr td min rainfall event ft3 s or m3 s

outflow peak discharge to inflow peak discharge and γ ratio of time to peak of outflow hydrograph to that of inflow γ 1 eq 10 shows that the required detention storage volume s t to accommodate runoff from a t yr rainfall is a function of rainfall duration td since storm duration is a variable it is sensible to size the detention capacity by identifying the critical storm duration td that yields the maximum storage s t that is 11 s t max t d q p t t d q a t d q a t c 1 γ 2 η 2 when c t 1 in eq 9 a proper optimization algorithm can be applied to determine s t chow et al 1988 provided a direct solution for s t under the condition of c t 1 therefore considering only random rainfall induced aleatory uncertainty the required design detention storage volume s t dsgn for the stipulated design frequency t dsgn can be obtained by solving eq 11 with t t dsgn 3 1 2 implications of epistemic uncertainties on design detention storage eq 11 shows that the t yr design detention storage volume s t is dependent on the runoff coefficient c and time of concentration tc which in turn are affected by the land use and other catchment factors affecting surface runoff production several empirical or semi empirical formulas have been applied in practice for estimating the time of concentration natural resources conservation service 2010 the formula adopted herein is the soil conservation service

retardance factor variability in land use vegetation cover soil characteristics including soil moisture condition and other conditions contribute to the variability in cn hjelmfelt et al 2001 and runoff coefficient c sen and altunkaynak 2006 the national engineering handbook part 630 hydrology natural resources conservation service 2004 2010 suggests treating cn as a random variable in addition to uncertainties contributed from the catchment parameters c and cn that affect runoff peak discharge qp t in eq 10 the rainfall intensity quantile of a selected frequency and duration i t t d is generally estimated from frequency analysis using finite rainfall data therefore the estimated i t t d could also be subject to uncertainty due to sampling error kite 1988 rao and hamed 2000 fig 2 is a rainfall intensity frequency relationship containing aleatory randomness of rainfall intensity horizontal axis and epistemic uncertainty in the estimated t yr rainfall quantile due to the sampling errors it can be observed that the presence of epistemic uncertainty in the rainfall quantile would result in uncertainty in rainfall load with a certain range of variation rather than simply a single value curve as shown by the solid line without epistemic uncertainty in this study epistemic uncertainties considered include the sampling error in the estimated t yr rainfall quantile i t t d and catchment runoff factors c and cn if only aleatory uncertainty is considered the design storage capacity of a detention basin can be uniquely determined once the design frequency of rainfall tdsgn is specified see the solid line of the storage frequency curve in fig 3 when epistemic uncertainties are considered this unique one to one relation between design capacity and design frequency no longer exists instead there will be uncertainty associated with the inflow volume resulting from rainfall of any return period fig 3 shows the distribution functions of maximum inflow volume f s t dsgn and f s t associated with the design frequency tdsgn and any arbitrary rainfall return period t as illustrated in fig 3 the presence of epistemic uncertainties induces uncertainty into design capacity when t tdsgn this raises a practical issue as to how the design storage capacity should be determined and on what basis for a design frequency tdsgn if the design capacity s t dsgn is taken as the nominal values of model parameters e g mean or modal values of runoff coefficient and curve number this implies that when a rainfall event with design frequency tdsgn occurs the detention basin would overflow approximately 50 of the time such a high failure probability would challenge the expectation that the design capacity of an engineering system should be able to perform satisfactorily with high performance reliability when the system is subjected to the external load defined by its design condition on the other hand to have a design capacity with zero failure probability is not realistic and would be unnecessarily expensive therefore a reasonable likelihood to anticipate unsatisfactory performance α would have to be chosen by the designer in such a manner that design storage capacity of the detention basin under the design frequency tdsgn would satisfy 13 pr s t dsgn s t dsgn α α in which s t dsgn α a deterministic constant chosen for the design storage capacity of a detention basin having a reliability a non exceedance probability of 1 α when the tdsgn yr rainfall event occurs by considering aleatory uncertainty only the exceedance probability that the runoff volume produced by any t yr rainfall event t t dsgn is larger than the design storage capacity i e pr s t dsgn s t dsgn o is dichotomous with a value of 0 for t t dsgn or 1 for t t dsgn however fig 3 shows that this is no longer the case when epistemic uncertainties exist the determination of s t dsgn α is intimately related to the notion of safety factor sf in engineering design practice when the design quantity is subject to uncertainty without epistemic uncertainty one could use the nominal model parameters φ o to obtain s t dsgn φ o as the design storage capacity however when epistemic uncertainties are considered in φ o sf with sf 1 is then used to determine the design capacity as sf s t dsgn φ o in doing so extra capacity is added beyond the nominally obtained design capacity to accommodate unexpected load due to uncertainty and or negligence in the design process the use of eq 13 provides a scientifically rational way to define the value of sf with explicit consideration given to the anticipated performance reliability of the system under the design condition i e sf s t dsgn α s t dsgn φ o 3 2 determination of detention storage capacity under epistemic uncertainty realizing that the t yr required storage volume s t is a random variable when epistemic uncertainties are considered it is essential to quantify the relevant statistical properties and distribution of s t so that the detention storage with a performance reliability of 1 α under the design condition s t dsgn α can be obtained by eq 13 for any rainfall frequency of t yr including t t dsgn the m th order moment of s t according to eq 7 can be expressed as 14 e s t m i t td c cn r 3 s t i t t d c cn m dh i t t d c cn m 1 2 in which h i t t d c cn trivariate cdf of t yr rainfall intensity i t t d of critical duration t d min runoff coefficient c and curve number cn from the raw moments the corresponding central moments of random s t can be derived for example the first three central moments of s t can be expressed in terms of raw moments as 15 mean μ s t e s t variance σ 2 s t e s t 2 μ s t 2 coeff of skewness γ s t e s t 3 3 μ s t e s t 2 2 μ s t 3 σ 3 s t in which μ s t σ 2 s t and γ s t

whereas that of the curve number is negatively skewed note that runoff coefficient c and curve number cn are two parameters with different representations of the same hydrologic effect on surface

natural randomness of rainfall intensity of various durations based on the rainfall idf relationship derived for the city of london canada simonovic and peck 2009 the three idf model coefficients are

standard error of the ev1 based rainfall intensity quantile with respect to duration and frequency is shown in fig 7 it is interesting to observe that this set of curves is closely parallel to each other and their functional relationship with the rainfall duration td can be represented through regression analysis by 22 ln s e 2 i t t d w t 0 0786 ln t d 2 where the constant w t is dependent on the return period t through regression analysis the values of w t affected by the return period t are listed below t yr 2 5 10 25 50 100 wt 1 5257 2 0469 2 3475 2 6464 2 8259 2 9785 which can be

determine the sampling error induced variance associated with the ev1 based t yr td min rainfall intensity quantile at the site with record length of n 80 years 4 1 sizing detention basin storage considering only aleatory uncertainty following the conventional design procedure detention basin capacity to accommodate the inflow hydrograph produced by the t yr rainfall intensity can be obtained by solving for s t from eq 11 along with the critical rainfall duration t d listed in row 2 of table 3 row 1 and 3 of the table define a unique storage frequency relationship under the conventional design procedure in which only aleatory uncertainty due to natural randomness of rainfall is considered 4 2 sizing detention storage considering aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty the required detention storage capacity s t with the critical rainfall duration t d can be obtained by solving eq 11 for the selected return period t however s t is a function of inflow peak discharge qp t and time of concentration tc which in turn are both random variables because the former is dependent on uncertain c while the latter on uncertain cn furthermore epistemic uncertainty due to sampling error associated with the estimated rainfall quantile i t t d also exists which contributes to the overall uncertainty in the determination of detention basin capacity the presence of epistemic uncertainties induces uncertainty in the design capacity associated with the design frequency therefore s t corresponding to any specified rainfall frequency t is a random variable by further incorporating sampling error in estimating the rainfall intensity quantile jointly with the uncertainty in c and cn the statistical moments for the required detention storage capacity s t can be obtained using eq 16 which is graphically represented in fig 4 by the event tree diagram 4 2 1 epistemic uncertainty in c and cn without considering sampling error associated with the t yr rainfall intensity quantile the consideration of uncertainty in c and cn covers only the 2nd and 3rd sub layers of the event tree in fig 4 based on the statistical properties of c and cn four representative points in the c cn domain and their corresponding joint probability mass can be determined by the rosenblueth two point method see table 4 the scs storage parameter s and the time of concentration tc corresponding to the four selected points are listed in the last two columns conditioned on the specific pair of c cn and its corresponding s and tc in table 4 the required detention basin capacity corresponding to the t yr rainfall s t and the corresponding critical rainfall duration td can be obtained from solving eq 11 the critical rainfall duration the corresponding rainfall intensity i t t d inflow peak discharge qp t and the required detention storages of different return periods s t conditioned on the four pairs of c cn listed in table 4 are summarized in table 5 a calculate statistical moments of design detention capacity s t dsgn fig 3 has shown that the presence of epistemic uncertainties induces uncertainty in the inflow volume to the detention basin for a specified design frequency tdsgn upon the selection of the design storage capacity for the tdsgn there still could exist a small probability α that random design inflow s t dsgn could exceed the design capacity s t dsgn α resulting in overflow to determine s t dsgn α it is necessary to calculate the statistical properties of the random s t dsgn and identify or assume its distribution function based on the conditional values of s t c cn corresponding to a pair of c cn listed in table 5 and their associated joint probability p c cn in table 4 the unconditional raw moments of random s t can be computed by 24 e s t dsgn m j k p c j cn k s t dsgn c j cn k m for m 1 2 3 from the raw moments the formulas to compute the corresponding central moments such as eq 15 can be found in many standard statistics textbooks if desired statistical moments of any order for the other design parameters listed in table 5 can also be calculated in the same manner for illustration the raw moments and the corresponding central moments of random s t are listed in table 6 as expected the unconditional mean of the required detention storage increases with the return period interestingly the values of standard deviation and coefficient of variation also increase with the rainfall frequency table 6 also shows that the values of the skewness coefficient of s t for all return periods are negative and the degree of asymmetry decreases with the return period with the exception of t 2 yr and 5 yr the skewness coefficient of required detention storage is very close to zero and therefore a normal distribution is quite justifiable to use herein to determine the design storage capacity s t dsgn α under different design frequencies with a stipulated performance reliability of 1 α for α 0 1 the corresponding values of s t α 0 1 with the reliability of 1 α 0 9 can be calculated according to eq 13 based on the normality condition the design capacity with 90 reliability can be determined as 25 s t α 0 1 μ s t φ 1 0 9 σ s t μ s t 1 2816 σ s t the results are given at the bottom row of table 6 it should be pointed out that the calculations done herein on the basis of normality are reasonably accurate but would somewhat over estimate the design capacity for 2 yr and 5 yr events because they are more negatively skewed b calculate conditional and annual overflow probabilities with reference to tdsgn referring to fig 3 the conditional overflow probability of inflow volume of any frequency t with reference to the detention capacity of a specified design frequency tdsgn and reliability 1 α can be calculated as 26 p r s t s t dsgn α t dsgn α d g s t in which d g s t g s t d s t with g s t being the probability density function of required detention storage s t to accommodate runoff produced by the t yr td min rainfall table 7 lists the conditional overflow probability p r s t s t dsgn α for a detention basin having storage capacity corresponding to the design frequency tdsgn in column wise with 1 α 0 9 reliability s t dsgn α 0 1 under the condition of varying rainstorm frequencies t in row wise the column s quo stands for status quo representing the condition of no detention expectedly without a detention facility this conditional overflow probability is unity for any storm frequency also since the design capacity s t dsgn α 0 1 is set at 1 α 0 9 the t yr storm is expect to have the overflow probability of α 0 1 when t tdsgn as underlined however the presence of epistemic uncertainties shown in fig 3 implies that this overflow probability is not necessarily equal to 1 0 when t tdsgn or equal to zero when t tdsgn under the normality condition for s t the conditional overflow probability can be easily computed as 27 p r s t s t dsgn α 1 φ s t dsgn α μ s t σ s t this is illustrated in the columns associated with tdsgn 25 yr in that the detention capacity designed on the basis of a lower return period can have some likelihood to accommodate runoff produced by rainstorms with higher return periods to determine the annual overflow probability aop of the detention facility one can integrate the conditional overflow probability under a specified design frequency tdsgn over the occurrence frequency of storm defined by the aleatory uncertainty of random rainfall as 28 aop s t dsgn α 1 p r s t s t dsgn α 1 t 2 dt 0 1 p r s t s t dsgn α df in which aop s t dsgn α is the annual overflow probability of the detention basin having a design capacity s t dsgn α f 1 1 t and f dsgn 1 1 t d s g n referring to eq 28 the last row of table 7 lists the aop for each design frequency tdsgn which are obtained by integrating over the range of storm frequencies listed in the 1st column the aop is identical to the aep defined in eq 6 it can be seen in table 7 that the annual overflow probabilities are lower than the nominal value of 1 tdsgn when the design exceedance probability is set at α 0 1 it is expected that the aop would be lower than the nominal overflow probability as the value of α gets smaller because a larger safety factor is used in determining the design capacity s t dsgn α the effect of α on aop is presented in section 4 3 4 2 2 considering epistemic uncertainty in c cn and rainfall quantiles when considering sampling error associated with the rainfall intensity quantile see fig 4 the t yr td min rainfall intensity quantile i t t d is treated as a normal random variable with the mean obtained from the rainfall idf eq 9 and the standard deviation equaling the corresponding standard error s e i t t d calculated by eq 22 in conjunction with eq 23 a statistical properties of detention basin storage volume random rainfall intensity quantile i t t d can be treated as statistically independent of random watershed characteristics c cn the normality assumption of i t t d renders equal probability allocation of 0 5 to the two points of i t t d s e i t t d by using the rosenblueth method as shown in fig 4 the joint probability of each branch of the tree can be determined as t d 29 p i t t d ℓ c j cn k p i t t d ℓ p c j cn k 0 5 p c j cn k for ℓ j k or in which p c j cn k joint probability of a particular pair of c cn listed in table 4 for an example p i t t d c cn 0 5 p c cn 0 5 0 0777 0 0389 in which p c cn 0 0777 is given in table 4 based on the information in table 4 one s t can obtain the needed parameters for detention design such as critical rainfall duration runoff peak q p t and the required detention storage s t under the condition of two representative rainfall intensity values defined by for the selected rainfall frequency of interest for example under the rainfall intensity quantile i t t d i t t d s e i t t d table 8 lists the design parameters for sizing the detention basin considering four pairs of c cn which include the critical rainfall duration the corresponding rainfall intensity peak inflow and required detention basin capacity obtainable from solving eq 11 table 8 represents the upper half of the event tree shown in fig 4 similar calculations can be made on the lower half of the tree under the rainfall intensity quantile of i t t d i t t d s e i t t d like the procedure presented in 4 2 1 a statistical properties of random design capacity s t dsgn are obtained to determine the size of detention basin s t dsgn α of a specified reliability 1 α because sampling error associated with the t yr td min rainfall quantile i t t d is independent of c and cn the m th order unconditional raw moments of random by considering three types of epistemic uncertainty according to eq 16 can be rewritten as 30 e s t m ℓ p i t t d ℓ j k p c j cn k s t c j cn k i t t d ℓ m ℓ p i t t d ℓ e s t c cn i t t d ℓ m where e s t c cn i t t d ℓ m is the conditional m th order moment of required detention storage s t to accommodate inflow produced by rainfall i t t d ℓ that can be obtained in a similar manner as eq 24 from the unconditional raw moments of different orders eq 15 can be used to compute the corresponding central moments by considering three types epistemic uncertainties table 9 lists the central moments of random s t under different rainfall frequencies similar to the case of considering uncertainty in c cn the unconditional mean standard deviation and skewness coefficient of required detention storage increases with the rainfall frequency table 9 also shows that the values of the skewness coefficient of s t for all return periods but t 2 yr are positive and the degree of asymmetry more or less stays constant with return period and is close to zero hence a normal distribution is quite suitable to use to determine the design storage capacity s t dsgn α as eq 25 under different design rainfall frequencies with the performance reliability of 1 α b conditional and annual overflow probabilities with reference to tdsgn upon the determination of design capacity s t dsgn α the conditional overflow probability of inflow volume of any frequency t exceeding the design capacity can be calculated using eq 26 according to the statistical properties of the required storage volume s t under the t yr rainfall listed in table 9 under the normality condition this probability can be obtained from eq 27 the results listed in table 10 correspond to design capacity s t dsgn α 0 1 with a 90 performance reliability the conditional overflow probability under a specified design frequency tdsgn over the occurrence frequency of rainstorms defining the aleatory uncertainty can also be determined by eqs 26 or 27 table 10 shows that the annual overflow probabilities in last row are lower than the nominal value of 1 tdsgn when the failure probability under the design condition is set at α 0 1 last row it is expected that the aop would be lower than the nominal aop as the value of α gets smaller because the corresponding safety factor used in determining the design capacity s t dsgn α is larger 4 3 effects of uncertainty on detention basin design capacity and performance based on the foregoing analysis one can make quantitative assessment of the effect of various uncertainties on the detention basin capacity fig 8 shows a comparison of the mean and standard deviation of required detention storage s t to accommodate runoff produced by t yr rainfall under different types of uncertainty based on the results listed in tables 6 and 9 in the figure a stands for aleatory uncertainty ep θ stands for epistemic uncertainty involving θ which includes runoff coefficient c curve number cn and rainfall intensity quantile rain i t t d notice that the mean value curves of s t are practically identical under all conditions however the corresponding standard deviation curves diff s t dsgn α er significantly depending on the type of epistemic uncertainty considered as expected the standard deviation of s t increases with number of design parameters subject to epistemic uncertainty in this example σ s t under the consideration of epistemic uncertainty c cn rain is about 2 5 times that of considering c cn even under the assumed rainfall record length of n 80 fig 9 shows a comparison of under different types of epistemic uncertainty and desired performance reliability p s 1 α of 90 and 50 as shown in the figure the three curves corresponding to p s 50 are nearly identical because the three conditions yield almost the same average design detention storage at p s 90 the s t dsgn α 0 1 curve under a ep c cn rain as expected is higher than that under a ep c cn because the standard deviation σ s t dsgn under the former condition is larger as shown in fig 8 the magnitude of design storage capacity considering epistemic uncertainty increases with desired reliability 1 α which corresponds to a larger factor of safety for other reliability levels the design detention capacity under two different uncertainty considerations are listed in table 11 information contained in table 11 also includes aop and its equivalent return period ert defined by ert 1 aop the aop corresponding to s t dsgn α under different types of uncertainty t dsgn and reliability are calculated using eq 28 it is observed that when considering epistemic uncertainty and α 0 5 the aop of s t dsgn α corresponding to a design frequency t dsgn is lower than the nominal aop i e 1 t dsgn considering only aleatory uncertainty and this aop decreases as the reliability requirement 1 α increases in other words by considering epistemic uncertainty the design detention storage capacity in this example reveals that for α 0 5 31 aop s t dsgn α 1 t dsgn or ert s t dsgn α t dsgn whereas for α 0 5 the above inequality relation is reversed another useful assessment of the uncertainty effect on the design of a detention basin here is to compare the anticipated performance indicators under the condition of a given uncertainty type when the system is subject to a different type of uncertainty condition for example the aop or ert listed in table 11 are obtained under the uncertainty and reliability consideration listed in each block of the first two columns some useful insights are gained by quantifying the values of aop or ert under one type of uncertainty consideration when the detention basin is subject to the other condition of uncertainty referring to table 12 case i lists the value of aop for the detention capacity corresponding to the design frequency considering aleatory only these results simply equal the reciprocal of the design frequency by comparing case ii a ii b with case i it is clearly observed as expected that the incorporation of epistemic uncertainties will result in a higher aop value than for the case considering only aleatory uncertainty black line in fig 9 and the corresponding ert is lower for instance the anticipated 10 yr design considering aleatory uncertainty actually has 8 38 yr return period when the situation is under case ii a i e epistemic uncertainty in c cn are considered a comparison of cases ii a and ii b in table 12 also reveals an interesting observation that is incorporation of more epistemic uncertainties may not necessarily result in a higher aop or lower ert as generally expected fig 10 shows that for 2 yr t dsgn 25 yr the values of aop are higher under case ii a a s t ep c cn red line than those of under case ii b a s t ep c cn rain blue line however for 50 yr t dsgn 100 yr the results are reversed according to the general expectation this can be explained by the fact that computation of aop involves the integration of conditional exceedance probability p r s t s t dsgn over the domain of random rainfall as shown by eq 28 although fig 7 clearly shows that consideration of more epistemic uncertainty leads to a higher standard deviation in detention storage capacity associated with a design frequency this does not necessary correspond to higher conditional exceedance probability leading to higher aop another plausible explanation of this phenomenon might refer to eq 20 with n 80 yr the sampling error associated with the rainfall quantile i t dsgn t d with t dsgn 25 yr would not be sufficiently large enough to make visible addition to the overall uncertainty of the design capacity beyond that c and cn have made on the other hand when t dsgn approaches the record length and gets larger the sampling error in the rainfall quantile would become sufficiently large to contribute the overall uncertainty of design capacity the corresponding aop would become higher to examine the detention performance under the design of different reliability requirements and epistemic uncertainty c cn when the system actually is subject to epistemic uncertainty of c cn rain one can compare the aop and ert of case iii in table 12 with those in case ii in table 11 it can be observed in fig 11 that the values of aop of detention capacity designed under the consideration of c cn is lower than those when the sampling error induced epistemic uncertainty in rainfall quantile actually is considered the amount of underestimation of aop without considering the sampling error in rainfall quantile even with about 80 years of data can vary for t dsgn 2 yr 100 yr from 20 to 30 15 28 10 24 and 0 16 with performance reliability requirement ps 90 80 70 and 50 respectively fig 11 shows that with ps 90 the design capacity considering epistemic uncertainty c cn would result in a lower aop solid red line than the notional design aop value black line however if the reality is that epistemic uncertainty also includes sampling error in the rainfall quantile the actual aop would be as high as the notional aop dotted red line in other words the safety factor provided in the design with a 90 reliability requirement considering epistemic uncertainty in c cn would almost be completely cancelled out by the uncertainty due to sampling error in the rainfall quantile with a lower reliability requirement omitting sampling error in the rainfall quantiles could result in actual aop values that are higher than anticipated as shown by the dotted curves of different colors in fig 11 that lie above the solid black line 5 summary and conclusions uncertainties in hydrosystems design and analysis can be categorized into two types namely aleatory and epistemic the former arises from the natural randomness of hydrologic processes whereas the latter are due to knowledge deficiency in model usage including its structure and parameter specifications the conventional frequency based design approach considers aleatory uncertainty from natural random variability with which one can establish a one to one relation between design capacity and design return period once the design frequency is stipulated the design capacity of the hydrosystem is uniquely determined however the reality is that both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties exist this study shows that the presence of epistemic uncertainties introduces uncertainty into design capacity it implies two things 1 the design capacity is a random variable and the engineer needs to quantify its uncertainty features and 2 the designer has to determine the magnitude of design capacity by stipulating his her anticipated performance reliability when the system is subject to the design load condition depending on the complexity of the problem a number of ways can be implemented for probabilistic design of hydrosystems considering aleatory and epistemic uncertainties this paper presents a viable framework using a probabilistic point estimation method to quantify uncertainty features of design capacity under the condition of design frequency and loads of other frequencies through an example of detention basin design using the modified rational method the paper illustrates the methodological framework by considering aleatory uncertainty from rainfall and epistemic uncertainties from runoff coefficient curve number and sampling error in design rainfall quantile furthermore effects of including different items of uncertainty and performance reliability on the design detention capacity are examined it is observed that the mean value of the design capacity of the detention basin increases with the design return period and interestingly this relation is practically the same under the consideration of different types of uncertainty expectedly the standard deviation associated with the design capacity when subject to epistemic uncertainty increases with both design frequency and items of epistemic uncertainty considered it is worth noting that the epistemic uncertainty due to sampling error in the rainfall quantile should not be ignored in the detention basin example presented herein the standard deviation of design capacity considering sampling error in the rainfall quantile even with a sample size of 80 is about 2 5 times higher than that without considering it under the consideration of certain items of epistemic uncertainty the magnitude of design capacity increase with the required performance reliability furthermore when considering more items of epistemic uncertainty the magnitude of design capacity corresponding to a performance reliability is larger than that of considering less items of epistemic uncertainty because the former produces higher value of the standard deviation with reference to aleatory uncertainty further inclusion of epistemic uncertainty would lead to a higher annual failure probability than the nominal value expected in other words for a hydrosystem with capacity designed under the design frequency of tdsgn the actual annual exceedance probability will be higher than its expected value of 1 tdsgn i e the actual equivalent return period is lower than tdsgn when epistemic uncertainties are considered the detention basin example used herein showed that the annual overflow probability without considering epistemic uncertainties could be under estimated by 10 40 depending on the design frequency and items of epistemic uncertainty considered it is also interesting to note one thing namely the inclusion of more items of epistemic uncertainty results in higher standard deviation in design capacity but it does not necessarily lead to a higher annual failure probability for the hydrosystem than obtained when considering less items of epistemic uncertainty as normally expected this is because of the nonlinear relation among annual failure probability statistical moments of design capacity stipulated performance reliability and the design frequency under consideration in this regard one would have to carry out the failure probability calculations under different items of epistemic uncertainty to evaluate their effects on the system performance acknowledgments this study is supported by the joint research under the national research foundation korea ministry of science technology taiwan

7529,artificial recharge measures have been adopted to control the drawdown of confined aquifers and the ground subsidence caused by dewatering during deep excavation in tianjin shanghai and other regions in china however research on recharge theory is still limited additionally confined aquifers consisting of silt and silty sand in tianjin have lower hydraulic conductivities than those consisting of sand or gravel and the feasibility and effectiveness of recharge methods in these semiconfined aquifers urgently require investigation a series of single well and multiwell pumping and recharge tests was conducted at a metro station excavation site in tianjin the test results showed that it was feasible to recharge silt and silty sand semiconfined aquifers and to a certain extent the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the pumping tests could be used to predict the water level rise during single well recharge however the predicted results underestimated the water level rise near the recharge well within 7 m by approximately 10 25 likely because the permeability coefficient around the well was reduced during the recharge process pressured recharge significantly improved the efficiency of the recharge process maintaining the recharge and pumping rates at a nearly equal level effectively controlled the surrounding surface and building settlement however the surrounding surface subsidence tended to rapidly develop when recharge stopped therefore the recharge process should continue and gradually stop after the pumping stops the twin well combined recharge technique can be used to control the head loss of an aquifer when one of the recharge wells requires pumping to solve the associated clogging problems keywords semiconfined aquifer recharge pumping subsidence control twin well combined recharge 1 introduction as the scale and depth of deep excavation have expanded the safety stability and environmental influence of excavation have drawn increased attention relieving the pressure in a confined aquifer is usually essential for conducting a safe excavation and avoiding seepage and uprushing damage however sometimes water resistant curtains cannot completely cut off the groundwater flowing in and out of the excavation and drawdown occurs outside the excavation wang et al 2012 which may cause severe ground subsidence and damage the surrounding buildings and underground structures as a measure to increase the head of confined aquifers artificial recharge has been adopted in some deep excavation projects to control the subsidence caused by dewatering such as in winchester uk powrie and roberts 1995 and shanghai and hangzhou china qu and xu 2012 yu and gong 2001 previous engineering projects have found that artificial recharge is successful in limiting the drawdown caused by pressure relief during an excavation project therefore this approach has been recognized as an effective and economical method for controlling land subsidence wu et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 and recycling the groundwater pumped during excavation sayana et al 2010 yamanaka et al 2011 in the past artificial recharge has been used to solve the long term land subsidence problems created during groundwater extraction in confined aquifers that act as a water supply shi et al 2016 phien wej et al 2006 hayashi et al 2009 gambolati and teatini 2015 and provide long term storage of water resources voudouris et al 2006 bhuiyan 2015 coes et al 2007 the recharge methods used for these two objectives are typically long term recharge methods in deep confined aquifers and such methods have been studied extensively however although recharge methods had been applied in some deep excavation projects research on short term recharge in shallow confined aquifers involved in deep excavation engineering is relatively limited and lags far behind the related practice specifically systematic studies do not exist regarding the cone curves of water level rise during recharge the influential factors of recharge and the subsidence variations under different pumping and recharge conditions which are all crucial factors when designing dewatering and recharge systems therefore these factors are investigated in this study additionally another problem exists regarding recharge measures in tianjin which is the industrial center of northern china and is situated in a soft soil area near the bohai sea as shown in fig 1 recently artificial recharge measures have been implemented at a few excavation sites in tianjin zheng et al 2013 however the aquifers in tianjin consist of silt and silty sand layers and have a lower hydraulic conductivity than those consisting of sand or gravel these aquifers in tianjin are deemed semiconfined aquifers in this study to distinguish them from normal confined aquifers the feasibility and effectiveness of recharge methods in such semiconfined aquifers require investigation in this paper a series of single well and multiwell pumping and recharge tests with and without artificial pressure was performed outside a metro station excavation site in tianjin during the tests we measured the head of the semiconfined aquifer in wells located at different distances from the pumping and recharge wells the subsidence of the ground surface and the pore pressures at different depths then the cone shaped curves of the water level rise were obtained and compared with those of drawdown during dewatering additionally the subsidence during the pumping and recharge processes the effect of the artificial pressure on the recharge capacity and the effect of the twin well combined recharge technique were analyzed and discussed the results derived from these tests further indicated the feasibility and effectiveness of using recharge measures in silt and silty sand semiconfined aquifers and provide information for designing dewatering and recharge systems 2 field test and numerical simulation introduction 2 1 recharge site and objectives a series of recharge tests was conducted outside a metro station site in tianjin as shown in fig 1 the test site was located inside the construction site fence of the metro station a section view of the hydrogeology setting of tianjin is shown in fig 2 the greatest excavation depth in tianjin is approximately 35 40 m therefore the first aquifer group which is the shallow aquifer group in tianjin and mainly above the depth of 75 m has the largest influence on deep excavation projects there are four aquifers in the first aquifer group as shown in fig 3 which illustrates a typical geological section at this site the aquifers include a phreatic aquifer and the first second and third semiconfined aquifers the head of the phreatic groundwater is located at approximately 1 37 m the first semiconfined aquifer is the ⑨2 silt layer with a head of 1 85 m the second semiconfined aquifer consists of the ⑪2 silt layer and the ⑫2 silty sand layer with heads of 2 958 to 3 058 m the third semiconfined aquifer is the ⑬2 silt layer with a head of 3 104 to 3 075 m during the metro station excavation at this site the anti uprush safety coefficient was not satisfied therefore the head of the second semiconfined aquifer needed to be reduced to avoid uprush failure at the bottom of the excavation however the pressure relief in the second semiconfined aquifer could cause drawdown in the semiconfined aquifers and ground subsidence outside the excavation zone to control the environmental influence of the dewatering process recharge measures were considered for this project however the hydraulic parameters of the semiconfined aquifers recharge feasibility and effect of recharge on the surroundings were unknown thus it was necessary to conduct specific pumping and recharge tests at this site to provide a reference and basis for the subsequent design of the recharge system for this metro station excavation and other similar projects the pumping and recharge tests were conducted before the construction of the diaphragm walls of this metro station excavation 2 2 field test introduction 2 2 1 pumping wells recharge wells and monitoring points the plan layout of the recharge wells and observation wells is shown in fig 4 in which the radius of each concentric circle differs by 5 m table 1 shows the initial head in each test well the details of the test wells and the monitoring points the structures of different types of test wells are presented in fig 3 the depth of the three recharge wells h1 h3 was 51 m and their screens were located in the second semiconfined aquifer there were eight observation wells g1 g7 and c1 the screens of g1 g6 with a depth of 48 m and c1 51 m were located in the same semiconfined aquifer as those of the recharge wells whereas the screen of g7 61 m was located in the third semiconfined aquifer two main subsidence monitoring sections were arranged the d1 d9 section and d13 d10 section as shown in fig 4 the monitoring range was 50 m and the space between two adjacent monitoring points was 5 m some locations were blocked due to the presence of containers in total 20 ground surface subsidence monitoring points were utilized during the tests the groundwater pumping and recharging processes changed the pore water pressure in the soil therefore water pressure monitoring points were established in proximity to the g5 and g7 wells at each location four piezometers were installed at depths of 23 m 33 m 40 m and 55 m to monitor the pore pressure changes in the different soil layers as shown in fig 3 2 2 2 experimental scheme three types of pumping and recharge tests were designed and conducted as follows 1 single well test this test included the h1 single well pumping test and the h1 and h3 single well recharge tests 2 multiwell test the first multiwell test involved pumping g5 and g6 and simultaneously recharging h1 h2 and h3 and the second multiwell test involved pumping g5 and g6 the first multiwell test simulated the realistic operating conditions of a pumping and recharge system used in practical engineering 3 twin well test in practice when a recharge well has been operated for a relatively long period its recharge rate will decrease because the well becomes clogged therefore the recharge well must be periodically pumped to prevent well clogging however pumping the recharge well will eventually lead to drawdown in the semiconfined aquifer to avoid permanent plastic subsidence caused by periodic drawdown we proposed the twin well combined recharge technique in which the recharge wells were set up in pairs so that a well could be recharged when another well required pumping h1 and c1 can be considered twin wells the specific working conditions of the three abovementioned test types are listed in table 2 the water levels of the observation wells were monitored at 10 min intervals the subsidence points were monitored twice a day at 9 am and 6 pm 2 3 numerical simulation introduction to verify the field test results and investigate the relationship between the drawdown curve and recharge cone curve numerical simulations of the 1 m3 h h1 well pumping test and the 0 5 m3 h 1 m3 h and 2 m3 h recharge tests were conducted using modflow the mesh and dimensions of the model are shown in fig 5 the simulations used a constant head boundary and a transient state model 3 analyses of the single well test results 3 1 water level change caused by pumping and recharging as shown in table 2 the h3 recharge test h1 pumping test and h1 recharge test for the second semiconfined aquifer were sequentially conducted 3 1 1 single well recharge test of h3 3 1 1 1 comparison of the recharge capacities under natural and recharge pressure conditions the main objectives of the h3 recharge test were to investigate the maximum recharge rates in the silt and silty sand semiconfined aquifer under natural recharge conditions without an artificial recharge pressure and with a recharge pressure and to determine the maximum recharge pressure the single well recharge test of h3 was initiated with a recharge rate of 0 5 m3 h without an applied artificial pressure the recharge rate increased by 0 5 m3 h every half hour during the natural recharge stage the curves of the recharge rate and recharge pressure versus time are shown in fig 6 the maximum recharge rate during the natural recharge of h3 was 2 8 m3 h and at this recharge rate the water level in h3 reached the mouth of the well and maintained a stable equilibrium state after the natural recharge reached the maximum recharge rate the h3 well was recharged by applying an increasing recharge pressure then the recharge rate gradually increased finally as shown in fig 6 the recharge rate and recharge pressure reached relatively stable states at 5 5 m3 h and 0 05 0 06 mpa respectively if the recharge pressure was increased to values higher than 0 05 0 06 mpa water would flow out from the side of the well therefore the maximum pressured recharge rate was approximately 5 5 m3 h if the borehole of the well was tightly sealed the recharge rate could increase further the pressured recharge significantly improved the recharge efficiency 3 1 1 2 water level curve during the h3 recharge test the curves of the rising water levels in different observation wells during the single well recharge test of h3 are shown in fig 7 the water levels in the observation wells rapidly rose during the first 6 7 h and then gradually reached relatively stable levels 3 1 2 single well pumping test of h1 the duration of pumping in the h1 well was 1 d and the extraction rate was approximately 0 9 m3 h the drawdown in h1 was 22 13 m the drawdown curves in different observation wells are shown in fig 8 the water level of the second semiconfined aquifer rapidly decreased during the first 3 4 h and then gradually reached a stable state the recovery of the water level lasted for 6 7 h after stopping the pumping process however the final recovered water level was approximately 0 4 m deeper than the initial water level 3 1 3 single well recharge test of h1 after 19 h the water level of the h1 well pumping test did not change then the recharge test of the h1 well was initiated the single well recharge test of h1 was divided into three stages according to the recharge rates of 2 m3 h 1 m3 h and 0 5 m3 h the recharge test with a rate of 1 m3 h followed the test with a rate of 2 m3 h without interruption as shown in fig 9 whereas the recharge test with a rate of 0 5 m3 h was conducted separately after the water level recovered as shown in fig 10 as shown in figs 9 and 10 the water level in each observation well instantly changed after the recharge rate changed the larger the recharge rate was the higher the water level was when the recharge rate was 2 m3 h and 0 5 m3 h the water levels all rapidly changed during the first 6 7 h then they tended to gradually stabilize after 6 7 h the time required for the water level to become stable was much longer during the recharge test 6 7 h than during the h1 single well pumping test 3 4 h based on previous studies taneja and khepar 1996 the permeability coefficient k of the aquifer in the vicinity of the well during recharge can be reduced by 15 compared with that during pumping this reduction can be achieved because during the recharge process fine particles change their positions in the pore space resulting in physical clogging around the well this clogging might be the reason that the time required for the recharge to stabilize was longer than that observed during the pumping test 3 2 analysis of the hydrogeological parameters 3 2 1 hydrogeological parameters derived using the cooper jacob method the results of the 1 m3 h h1 single well pumping test and 0 5 m3 h and 2 m3 h h1 single well recharge tests were analyzed using the cooper jacob method cooper and jacob 1946 fig 11 shows the h logt curves for the example case of a constant recharge rate of 0 5 m3 h the transmissivity coefficient t and the water storage coefficient s can be determined based on fig 11 then based on these values the permeability coefficient k and unit storage coefficient ss can be determined according to the above method k was calculated to be 0 593 m d 0 524 m d and 0 495 m d based on the 1 m3 h single well pumping test and the 0 5 m3 h and 2 m3 h recharge tests respectively and ss was calculated to be 1 675e 4 1 587e 4 and 4 843e 4 respectively the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the pumping test results were similar to those obtained from the recharge test results which indicated that the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the pumping test results could be used to predict the water level rise during the recharge tests 3 2 2 numerical simulation in the numerical simulations of h1 well pumping and recharge tests the hydrogeological parameters derived from the h1 single well pumping test k and ss were 0 593 m d and 1 675e 4 respectively were used to further investigate whether the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the pumping test data could be used to predict the water level rise during single well recharge the comparison between the numerical simulation results and the measured data from the drawdown funnel curve s r curve in the region where the water table became stable during the h1 pumping test is shown in fig 12 the numerical simulation results were similar to the measured data and the root mean square deviation rmsd was 0 186 m indicating that the hydrogeological parameters obtained using the cooper jacob method were relatively reasonable the numerical simulations of the h1 recharge tests were conducted using the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the h1 single well pumping test the comparison of the recharge cone curves h r curve at different recharge rates obtained from the numerical simulation and the measured data is shown in fig 13 for each recharge rate the h r recharge curves obtained from the numerical simulation and the measured data were similar when the distance between the recharge well and observation well was larger than 7 m rmsds were 0 064 m 0 123 m and 0 275 m for recharge rates of 0 5 m3 h 1 m3 h and 2 m3 h respectively however the measured values were larger than the numerical simulation results when the distance was smaller than 7 m fig 14 shows a comparison of the measured water levels for the recharge test and a pumping test conducted at another site in tianjin the measured drawdown curves from the pumping tests and the curves of water level rise due to recharge were similar at locations that were further than 5 m from the central well and the recharge test values were larger than the drawdown test values within 5 m of the central well at each flow rate 1 m3 h 2 m3 h 3 m3 h and 4 m3 h the results obtained at this experimental site were similar to those obtained in this paper at the same flow rate several possible reasons could explain the differences between the pumping curves and recharge curves within a certain distance of the center well first turbulence may have occurred near the recharge well second as stated in the section 3 1 2 the recharge process could have caused a certain degree of clogging in the semiconfined aquifer around the well which could have decreased the permeability coefficient of the semiconfined aquifer around the well bichara 1986 taneja and khepar 1996 pavelic et al 2011 nie et al 2011 pavelic et al 2007 the third possible reason was attributed to the bridge filter structure of the recharge well screen as different flow directions could have led to different well loss values during the pumping and recharge tests longe 2011 altunkaynak 2010 avci et al 2010 this preliminary discussion of the possible discrepancies between the results is based on the existing literature and the actual reasons must be investigated further the above analysis suggests that the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the measured drawdown data from the pumping tests could be used to predict the water level rise during the recharge tests however the predicted results underestimated the water level rise near the recharge well within 7 m in the actual project in practical engineering when only the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the pumping test are available these parameters can be used to design the recharge scheme however the water level rise near the recharge well should be adjusted 3 3 analysis of the ground surface subsidence caused by pumping and recharge processes the h1 single well pumping and recharge tests were conducted from may 20 to may 29 2014 fig 15 shows the time history curves of the subsidence measured at three typical monitoring points d4 d5 and d6 which were 14 76 m 10 55 m and 5 46 m from h1 respectively and the water level variation in well c1 during the h1 single well pumping and recharge tests positive values represent uplift and negative values represent subsidence as shown in fig 15 the maximum subsidence was approximately 1 8 mm during the pumping test after the pumping stopped the surface subsidence decreased during the 2 m3 h h1 recharge test the water level of the c1 well reached the maximum value approximately 6 7 h after the start of recharge however the uplift of the ground surface began to sharply increase approximately 0 5 d after the recharge began and reached a peak value 3 3 mm at d5 1 d after the recharge began when the recharge rate was reduced from 2 m3 h to 1 m3 h the amount of ground surface uplift significantly decreased during the first day until it slightly began to increase the uplift reached another maximum value approximately 0 4 d after the 1 m3 h recharge process stopped then the ground surface began to rapidly sink and the uplift deformation of the ground surface turned into subsidence when recharge in h1 was restarted at a rate of 0 5 m3 h the uplift of the ground surface reached the maximum value approximately 0 5 d after the water level reached its maximum value which was the same as observed during the recharge process with a rate of 2 m3 h after the recharge stopped the ground surface rapidly sunk and the maximum subsidence reached approximately 2 mm based on the analysis results of the abovementioned curves the amount of ground surface uplift increased with increasing recharge rate during the recharge process the change in ground surface subsidence or uplift lagged behind the change in the water level by approximately 0 5 d additionally when the recharge rate decreased or the recharge stopped the ground surface significantly sunk and the uplift deformation could even transition to subsidence 3 4 analysis of the measured pore water pressure variations during the pumping and recharge processes during the single well pumping and recharge tests of h1 the variations in the pore water pressures were monitored by the piezometers adjacent to the g7 and g5 observation wells which were 5 m and 18 m from h1 respectively the horizontal distance between the c1 well and the h1 well was close to that between the g7 well and h1 well therefore the water level variation curves of the c1 g7 and g5 wells are plotted in fig 16 for comparison with the pore water pressure changes the curves in fig 16 show that as the vertical distance from the second semiconfined aquifer increased the pore pressure change decreased as shown in fig 16 a the change in the pore water pressure lagged behind the water level of the observation well which was consistent with the vertical deformation of the ground this trend was mainly because the pore water pressure gauges at depths of 23 m 33 m and 40 m were located in silty clay layers with low permeability coefficients after the water level in the second semiconfined aquifer changed the pore pressures in the overlying silty clay layers slowly changed due to the small permeability coefficients based on the above analysis we speculated that the subsidence or the rise of the ground surface mainly consisted of two parts the first part included the vertical deformation of the semiconfined aquifer during pumping or recharging and the second part included the vertical deformation of the overlying clay layers the vertical deformation of the semiconfined aquifer rapidly occurred however because the pore water pressure in the overlying silty clay layer dissipated much more slowly the associated vertical deformation occurred at a much slower rate this trend may have caused the subsidence and rise of the ground surface to slightly lag behind the change in the head level of the semiconfined aquifer 4 analyses of the multiwell test results the g5 and g6 pumping tests and simultaneous h1 h2 and h3 recharge tests simulated the realistic operating conditions of a pumping and recharge system that controls the water level of a semiconfined aquifer at a building side the pumping wells and recharge wells were simultaneously opened and continued to run for 6 days the pumping rate or recharge rate of each well is shown in fig 17 in which the recharge rate is positive and the pumping rate is negative the time history curves of the water level changes in the observation wells during the multiwell test are shown in fig 18 in which water level increases are positive and drawdown is negative the pumping rate and recharge rate significantly fluctuated between june 4 and june 5 2014 during the beginning period of the multiwell test during this period the total recharge rate was much larger than the total pumping rate thus the water levels significantly rose then the rates gradually became stable after june 5 the pumping rates of the g5 and g6 wells were maintained at 1 6 m3 h and 1 35 m3 h respectively and the total pumping rate was 2 95 m3 h the recharge rates of h1 h2 and h3 were maintained at 0 95 m3 h 1 35 m3 h and 1 3 m3 h respectively and then the total recharge rate was 3 6 m3 h which was slightly larger than the total pumping rate at the same time the water levels began to stabilize the c1 and g1 g4 wells were located on the recharge well side of the site and were far from the pumping wells g5 and g6 the water levels in these wells all slightly increased when the recharge and pumping rates became stable the locations of the g1 and g3 wells were positioned where the protected buildings were located during pumping and recharge processes the water level changes in these two observation wells remained positive the results indicate that appropriate numbers of recharge wells arranged between the pumping wells and the protected buildings could maintain the stability of the water level near the protected buildings the time history curves of ground subsidence at certain typical monitoring points are shown in fig 19 d3 d4 d5 and d7 were located on the connection line of the recharge wells of h1 h2 and h3 and uplift deformation occurred at these points d11 was located on the pumping well side of the experiment and experienced subsidence deformation whereas d16 was located on the recharge well side i e the protected building side and slightly heaved these results suggest that the recharge process was particularly effective in controlling the ground surface subsidence 5 analyses of the twin well combined recharge test results the twin well combined recharge test was conducted to investigate the effect of the periodic operation of the spare recharge well on the ability to control the surrounding subsidence when the main recharge well required pumping during the test the c1 well was pumped to simulate a clogged main recharge well and the h1 well was recharged to simulate the spare recharge well c1 and h1 were opened at the same time and the water levels in the observation wells became stable after 10 h the pumping rate of the c1 well and recharge rate of the h1 well were both stabilized at 0 8 1 m3 h the time history curves of the head levels in the observation wells during the tests are shown in fig 20 as shown in fig 20 when the water levels became stable the levels in the wells closer to the recharge well specifically g1 g2 g3 and g6 increased by 0 4 0 26 0 12 and 0 15 m respectively whereas the drawdown in the well close to the pumping well g5 was 0 13 m when a nearby well was recharged the drawdown caused by pumping c1 was effectively controlled additionally the change in the water level caused by the simultaneous recharge and pumping processes during the test was basically equal to the superposition of the water level rise of h1 and drawdown of c1 as shown in fig 21 the test results verified the effectiveness of the twin well recharge technique 6 conclusions and recommendations single well twin well and multiwell tests of pumping and recharge in the second semiconfined aquifer were conducted at a metro station site in tianjin the shape of the recharge cone under different recharge rates the effect of the recharge pressure and the effect of recharge on subsidence control were analyzed the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 recharge tests with and without pressure showed that it is feasible to recharge a semiconfined aquifer with a relatively low conductivity coefficient such as an aquifer with silt and silty sand layers additionally the pressured recharge can remarkably improve the efficiency of the recharge process 2 the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the pumping tests could be used to predict the water level rise during single well recharge however the predicted results underestimated the water level rise near the recharge well within 7 m by approximately 10 25 likely because the permeability coefficient of the aquifer around the well is reduced during recharge because of fine particle clogging in practical engineering when only the hydrogeological parameters obtained from pumping tests are available these parameters can be used to design the recharge scheme however the water level rise near the recharge well should be adjusted 3 ground surface uplift increased with increasing recharge rate during the pumping and recharge processes the change in surface subsidence lagged behind the change in the water level by approximately 0 5 d this difference was mainly because the pore pressure dissipation and development of vertical deformation in the clay or silty clay layers were slower than the water level change in the confined layer in addition the ground surface rapidly subsided when the recharge rate was reduced or when recharge stopped therefore in practical engineering it should be appropriate to extend the recharge time and gradually reduce the recharge rate after the pumping is stopped to gradually stabilize the water level and avoid the rapid development of subsidence 4 artificial recharge measures can effectively control the groundwater level and ground subsidence during pumping in a deep excavation project in practice the recharge process should simultaneously begin with pumping and the gross recharge rate and gross pumping rate should be maintained at a similar level additionally the water treatment device that is on site can be used to treat the groundwater extracted during excavation then the treated water can be recharged to its original confined aquifer to avoid groundwater resource waste 5 in practical engineering when a recharge well becomes clogged and requires pumping the twin well combined recharge technique can be adopted to avoid water level drawdown in the twin well technique the recharge wells are closely arranged and in pairs when a recharge well requires pumping another recharge well can be simultaneously opened to control the water level acknowledgement this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51508382 and

7529,artificial recharge measures have been adopted to control the drawdown of confined aquifers and the ground subsidence caused by dewatering during deep excavation in tianjin shanghai and other regions in china however research on recharge theory is still limited additionally confined aquifers consisting of silt and silty sand in tianjin have lower hydraulic conductivities than those consisting of sand or gravel and the feasibility and effectiveness of recharge methods in these semiconfined aquifers urgently require investigation a series of single well and multiwell pumping and recharge tests was conducted at a metro station excavation site in tianjin the test results showed that it was feasible to recharge silt and silty sand semiconfined aquifers and to a certain extent the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the pumping tests could be used to predict the water level rise during single well recharge however the predicted results underestimated the water level rise near the recharge well within 7 m by approximately 10 25 likely because the permeability coefficient around the well was reduced during the recharge process pressured recharge significantly improved the efficiency of the recharge process maintaining the recharge and pumping rates at a nearly equal level effectively controlled the surrounding surface and building settlement however the surrounding surface subsidence tended to rapidly develop when recharge stopped therefore the recharge process should continue and gradually stop after the pumping stops the twin well combined recharge technique can be used to control the head loss of an aquifer when one of the recharge wells requires pumping to solve the associated clogging problems keywords semiconfined aquifer recharge pumping subsidence control twin well combined recharge 1 introduction as the scale and depth of deep excavation have expanded the safety stability and environmental influence of excavation have drawn increased attention relieving the pressure in a confined aquifer is usually essential for conducting a safe excavation and avoiding seepage and uprushing damage however sometimes water resistant curtains cannot completely cut off the groundwater flowing in and out of the excavation and drawdown occurs outside the excavation wang et al 2012 which may cause severe ground subsidence and damage

controlling land subsidence wu et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 and recycling the groundwater pumped during excavation sayana et al 2010 yamanaka et al 2011 in the past artificial recharge has been used to

semiconfined aquifers in this study to distinguish them from normal confined aquifers the feasibility and effectiveness of recharge methods in such semiconfined aquifers require investigation in this paper a series of single well and multiwell pumping and recharge tests with and without artificial pressure was performed outside a metro station excavation site in tianjin during the tests we measured the head of the semiconfined aquifer in wells located at different distances from the pumping and recharge wells the subsidence of the ground surface and the pore pressures at different depths then the cone shaped curves of the water level rise were obtained and compared with those of drawdown during dewatering additionally the subsidence during the pumping and recharge processes the effect of the artificial pressure on the recharge capacity and the effect of the twin well combined recharge technique were analyzed and discussed the results derived from these tests further indicated the feasibility and effectiveness of using recharge measures in silt and silty sand semiconfined aquifers and provide information for designing dewatering and recharge systems 2 field test and numerical simulation introduction 2 1 recharge site and objectives a series of recharge tests was conducted outside a metro station site in tianjin as shown in fig 1 the test site was located inside the construction site fence of the metro station a section view of the hydrogeology setting of tianjin is shown in fig 2 the greatest excavation depth in tianjin is approximately 35 40 m therefore the first aquifer group which is the shallow aquifer group in tianjin and mainly above the depth of 75 m has the largest influence on deep excavation projects there are four aquifers in the first aquifer group as shown in fig 3 which illustrates a typical geological section at this site the aquifers include a phreatic aquifer and the first second and third semiconfined aquifers the head of the phreatic groundwater is located at approximately 1 37 m the first semiconfined aquifer is the ⑨2 silt layer with a head of 1 85 m the second semiconfined aquifer consists of the ⑪2 silt layer and the ⑫2 silty sand layer with heads of 2 958 to 3 058 m the third semiconfined aquifer is the ⑬2 silt layer with a head of 3 104 to 3 075 m during the metro station excavation at this site the anti uprush safety coefficient was not satisfied therefore the head of the second semiconfined aquifer needed to be reduced to avoid uprush failure at the bottom of the excavation however the pressure relief in the second semiconfined aquifer could cause drawdown in the semiconfined aquifers and ground subsidence outside the excavation zone to control the environmental influence of the dewatering process recharge measures were considered for this project however the hydraulic parameters of the semiconfined aquifers recharge feasibility and effect of recharge on the surroundings were unknown thus it was necessary to conduct specific pumping and recharge tests at this site to provide a reference and basis for the subsequent design of the recharge system for this metro station excavation and other similar projects the pumping and recharge tests were conducted before the construction of the diaphragm walls of this metro station excavation 2 2 field test introduction 2 2 1 pumping wells

initial head in each test well the details of the test wells and the monitoring points the structures of different types of test wells are presented in fig 3 the depth of the three recharge wells h1 h3 was 51 m and their screens were located in the second semiconfined aquifer there were eight observation wells g1 g7 and c1 the screens of g1 g6 with a depth of 48 m and c1 51 m were located in the same semiconfined aquifer as those of the recharge wells whereas the screen of g7 61 m was located in the third semiconfined aquifer two main subsidence monitoring sections were arranged the d1 d9 section and d13 d10 section as shown in fig 4 the monitoring range was 50 m and the space between two adjacent monitoring points was 5 m some locations were blocked due to the presence of containers in total 20 ground surface subsidence monitoring points were utilized during the tests the groundwater pumping and recharging processes changed the pore water pressure in the soil therefore water pressure monitoring points were established in proximity to the g5 and g7 wells at each location four piezometers were installed at depths of 23 m 33 m 40 m and 55 m to monitor the pore pressure changes in the different soil layers as shown in fig 3 2 2 2 experimental scheme three types of pumping and recharge tests were designed and conducted as follows 1 single well test this test included the h1 single well pumping test and the h1 and h3 single well recharge tests 2 multiwell test the first multiwell test involved pumping g5 and g6 and simultaneously recharging h1 h2 and h3 and the second multiwell test involved pumping g5 and g6 the first multiwell test simulated the realistic operating conditions of a pumping and recharge system used in practical engineering 3 twin well test in practice when a recharge well has been operated for a relatively long period its recharge rate will decrease because the well becomes clogged therefore the recharge well must be periodically pumped to prevent well clogging however pumping the recharge well will eventually lead to drawdown in the semiconfined aquifer to avoid permanent plastic subsidence caused by periodic drawdown we proposed the twin well combined recharge technique in which the recharge wells were set up in pairs so that a well could be recharged when another well required pumping h1 and c1 can be considered twin wells the specific working conditions of the three abovementioned test types are listed in table 2 the water levels of the observation wells were monitored at 10 min intervals the subsidence points were monitored twice a day at 9 am and 6 pm 2 3 numerical simulation introduction to verify the field test results and investigate the relationship between the drawdown curve and recharge cone curve numerical simulations of the 1 m3 h h1 well pumping test and the 0 5 m3 h 1 m3 h and 2 m3 h recharge tests were conducted using modflow the mesh and dimensions of the model are shown in fig 5 the simulations used a constant head boundary and a transient state model 3 analyses of the single well test results 3 1 water level change caused by pumping and recharging as shown in table 2 the h3 recharge test h1 pumping test and h1 recharge test for the second semiconfined aquifer were sequentially conducted 3 1 1 single well recharge test of h3 3 1 1 1 comparison of the recharge capacities under natural and recharge pressure conditions the main objectives of the h3 recharge test were to investigate the maximum recharge rates in the silt and silty sand semiconfined aquifer under natural recharge conditions without an artificial recharge pressure and with a recharge pressure and to determine the maximum recharge pressure the single well recharge test of h3 was initiated with a recharge rate of 0 5 m3 h without an applied artificial pressure the recharge rate increased by 0 5 m3 h every half hour during the natural recharge stage the curves of the recharge rate and recharge pressure versus time are shown in fig 6 the maximum recharge rate during the natural recharge of h3 was 2 8 m3 h and at this recharge rate the water level in h3 reached the mouth of the well and maintained a stable equilibrium state after the natural recharge reached the maximum recharge rate the h3 well was recharged by applying an increasing recharge pressure then the recharge rate gradually increased finally as shown in fig 6 the recharge rate and recharge pressure reached relatively stable states at 5 5 m3 h and 0 05 0 06 mpa respectively if the recharge pressure was increased to values higher than 0 05 0 06 mpa water would flow out from the side of the well therefore the maximum pressured recharge rate was approximately 5 5 m3 h if the borehole of the well was tightly sealed the recharge rate could increase further the pressured recharge significantly improved the recharge efficiency 3 1 1 2 water level curve during the h3 recharge test the curves of the rising water levels in different observation wells during the single well recharge test of h3 are shown in fig 7 the water levels in the observation wells rapidly rose during the first 6 7 h and then gradually reached relatively stable levels 3 1 2 single well pumping test of h1 the duration of pumping in the h1 well was 1 d and the extraction rate was approximately 0 9 m3 h the drawdown in h1 was 22 13 m the drawdown curves in different observation wells are shown in fig 8 the water level of the second semiconfined aquifer rapidly decreased during the first 3 4 h and then gradually reached a stable state the recovery of the water level lasted for 6 7 h after stopping the pumping process however the final recovered water level was approximately 0 4 m deeper than the initial water level 3 1 3 single well recharge test of h1 after 19 h the water level of the h1 well pumping test did not change then the recharge test of the h1 well was initiated the single well recharge test of h1 was divided into three stages according to the recharge rates of 2 m3 h 1 m3 h and 0 5 m3 h the recharge test with a rate of 1 m3 h followed the test with a rate of 2 m3 h without interruption as shown in fig 9 whereas the recharge test with a rate of 0 5 m3 h was conducted separately after the water level recovered as shown in fig 10 as shown in figs 9 and 10 the water level in each observation well instantly changed after the recharge rate changed the larger the recharge rate was the higher the water level was when the recharge rate was 2 m3 h and 0 5 m3 h the water levels all rapidly changed during the first 6 7 h then they tended to gradually stabilize after 6 7 h the time required for the water level to become stable was much longer during the recharge test 6 7 h than during the h1 single well pumping test 3 4 h based on previous studies taneja and khepar 1996 the permeability coefficient k of the aquifer in the vicinity of the well during recharge can be reduced by 15 compared with that during pumping this reduction can be achieved because during the recharge process fine particles change their positions in the pore space resulting in physical clogging around the well this clogging might be the reason that the time required for the recharge to stabilize was longer than that observed during the pumping test 3 2 analysis of the hydrogeological parameters 3 2 1 hydrogeological parameters derived using the cooper jacob method the results of the 1 m3 h h1 single well pumping test and 0 5 m3 h and 2 m3 h h1 single well recharge tests were analyzed using the cooper jacob method cooper and jacob 1946 fig 11 shows the h logt curves for the example case of a constant recharge rate of 0 5 m3 h the transmissivity coefficient t and the water storage coefficient s can be determined based on fig 11 then based on these values the permeability coefficient k and unit storage coefficient ss can be determined according to the above method k was calculated to be 0 593 m d 0 524 m d and 0 495 m d based on the 1 m3 h single well pumping test and the 0 5 m3 h and 2 m3 h recharge tests respectively and ss was calculated to be 1 675e 4 1 587e 4 and 4 843e 4 respectively the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the pumping test results were similar to those obtained from the recharge test results which indicated that the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the pumping test results could be used to predict the water level rise during the recharge tests 3 2 2 numerical simulation in the numerical simulations of h1 well pumping and recharge tests the hydrogeological parameters derived from the h1 single well pumping test k and ss were 0 593 m d and 1 675e 4 respectively were used to further investigate whether the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the pumping test data could be used to predict the water level rise during single well recharge the comparison between the numerical simulation results and the measured data from the drawdown funnel curve s r curve in the region where the water table became stable during the h1 pumping test is shown in fig 12 the numerical simulation results were similar to the measured data and the root mean square deviation rmsd was 0 186 m indicating that the hydrogeological parameters obtained using the cooper jacob method were relatively reasonable the numerical simulations of the h1 recharge tests were conducted using the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the h1 single well pumping test the comparison of the recharge cone curves h r curve at different recharge rates obtained from the numerical simulation and the measured data is shown in fig 13 for each recharge rate the h r recharge curves obtained from the numerical simulation and the measured data were similar when the distance between the recharge well and observation well was larger than 7 m rmsds were 0 064 m 0 123 m and 0 275 m for recharge rates of 0 5 m3 h 1 m3 h and 2 m3 h respectively however the measured values were larger than the numerical simulation results when the distance was smaller than 7 m fig 14 shows a comparison of the measured water levels for the recharge test and a pumping test conducted at another site in tianjin the measured drawdown curves from the pumping tests and the curves of water level rise due to recharge were similar at locations that were further than 5 m from the central well and the recharge test values were larger than the drawdown test values within 5 m of the central well at each flow rate 1 m3 h 2 m3 h 3 m3 h and 4 m3 h the results obtained at this experimental site were similar to those obtained in this paper at the same flow rate several possible reasons could explain the differences between the pumping curves and recharge curves within a certain distance of the center well first turbulence may have occurred near the recharge well second as stated in the section 3 1 2 the recharge process could have caused a certain degree of clogging in the semiconfined aquifer around the well which could have decreased the permeability coefficient of the semiconfined aquifer around the well bichara 1986 taneja and khepar 1996 pavelic et al 2011 nie et al 2011 pavelic et al 2007 the third possible reason was attributed to the bridge filter structure of the recharge well screen as different flow directions could have led to different well loss values during the pumping and recharge tests longe 2011 altunkaynak 2010 avci et al 2010 this preliminary discussion of the possible discrepancies between the results is based on the existing literature and the actual reasons must be investigated further the above analysis suggests that the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the measured drawdown data from the pumping tests could be used to predict the water level rise during the recharge tests however the predicted results underestimated the water level rise near the recharge well within 7 m in the actual project in practical engineering when only the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the pumping test are available these parameters can be used to design the recharge scheme however the water level rise near the recharge well should be adjusted 3 3 analysis of the ground surface subsidence caused by pumping and recharge processes the h1 single well pumping and recharge tests were conducted from may 20 to may 29 2014 fig 15 shows the time history curves of the subsidence measured at three typical monitoring points d4 d5 and d6 which were 14 76 m 10 55 m and 5 46 m from h1 respectively and the water level variation in well c1 during the h1 single well pumping and recharge tests positive values represent uplift and negative values represent subsidence as shown in fig 15 the maximum subsidence was approximately 1 8 mm during the pumping test after the pumping stopped the surface subsidence decreased during the 2 m3 h h1 recharge test the water level of the c1 well reached the maximum value approximately 6 7 h after the start of recharge however the uplift of the ground surface began to sharply increase approximately 0 5 d after the recharge began and reached a peak value 3 3 mm at d5 1 d after the recharge began when the recharge rate was reduced from 2 m3 h to 1 m3 h the amount of ground surface uplift significantly decreased during the first day until it slightly began to increase the uplift reached another maximum value approximately 0 4 d after the 1 m3 h recharge process stopped then the ground surface began to rapidly sink and the uplift deformation of the ground surface turned into subsidence when recharge in h1 was restarted at a rate of 0 5 m3 h the uplift of the ground surface reached the maximum value approximately 0 5 d after the water level reached its maximum value which was the same as observed during the recharge process with a rate of 2 m3 h after the recharge stopped the ground surface rapidly sunk and the maximum subsidence reached approximately 2 mm based on the analysis results of the abovementioned curves the amount of ground surface uplift increased with increasing recharge rate during the recharge process the change in ground surface subsidence or uplift lagged behind the change in the water level by approximately 0 5 d additionally when the recharge rate decreased or the recharge stopped the ground surface significantly sunk and the uplift deformation could even transition to subsidence 3 4 analysis of the measured pore water pressure variations during the pumping and recharge processes during the single well pumping and recharge tests of h1 the variations in the pore water pressures were monitored by the piezometers adjacent to the g7 and g5 observation wells which were 5 m and 18 m from h1 respectively the horizontal distance between the c1 well and the h1 well was close to that between the g7 well and h1 well therefore the water level variation curves of the c1 g7 and g5 wells are plotted in fig 16 for comparison with the pore water pressure changes the curves in fig 16 show that as the vertical distance from the second semiconfined aquifer increased the pore pressure change decreased as shown in fig 16 a the change in the pore water pressure lagged behind the water level of the observation well which was consistent with the vertical deformation of the ground this trend was mainly because the pore water pressure gauges at depths of 23 m 33 m and 40 m were located in silty clay layers with low permeability coefficients after the water level in the second semiconfined aquifer changed the pore pressures in the overlying silty clay layers slowly changed due to the small permeability coefficients based on the above analysis we speculated that the subsidence or the rise of the ground surface mainly consisted of two parts the first part included the vertical deformation of the semiconfined aquifer during pumping or recharging and the second part included the vertical deformation of the overlying clay layers the vertical deformation of the semiconfined aquifer rapidly occurred however because the pore water pressure in the overlying silty clay layer dissipated much more slowly the associated vertical deformation occurred at a much slower rate this trend may have caused the subsidence and rise of the ground surface to slightly lag behind the change in the head level of the semiconfined aquifer 4 analyses of the multiwell test results the g5 and g6 pumping tests and simultaneous h1 h2 and h3 recharge tests simulated the realistic operating conditions of a pumping and recharge system that controls the water level of a semiconfined aquifer at a building side the pumping wells and recharge wells were simultaneously opened and continued to run for 6 days the pumping rate or recharge rate of each well is shown in fig 17 in which the recharge rate is positive and the pumping rate is negative the time history curves of the water level changes in the observation wells during the multiwell test are shown in fig 18 in which water level increases are positive and drawdown is negative the pumping rate and recharge rate significantly fluctuated between june 4 and june 5 2014 during the beginning period of the multiwell test during this period the total recharge rate was much larger than the total pumping rate thus the water levels significantly rose then the rates gradually became stable after june 5 the pumping rates of the g5 and g6 wells were maintained at 1 6 m3 h and 1 35 m3 h respectively and the total pumping rate was 2 95 m3 h the recharge rates of h1 h2 and h3 were maintained at 0 95 m3 h 1 35 m3 h and 1 3 m3 h respectively and then the total recharge rate was 3 6 m3 h which was slightly larger than the total pumping rate at the same time the water levels began to stabilize the c1 and g1 g4 wells were located on the recharge well side of the site and were far from the pumping wells g5 and g6 the water levels in these wells all slightly increased when the recharge and pumping rates became stable the locations of the g1 and g3 wells were positioned where the protected buildings were located during pumping and recharge processes the water level changes in these two observation wells remained positive the results indicate that appropriate numbers of recharge wells arranged between the pumping wells and the protected buildings could maintain the stability of the water level near the protected buildings the time history curves of ground subsidence at certain typical monitoring points are shown in fig 19 d3 d4 d5 and d7 were located on the connection line of the recharge wells of h1 h2 and h3 and uplift deformation occurred at these points d11 was located on the pumping well side of the experiment and experienced subsidence deformation whereas d16 was located on the recharge well side i e the protected building side and slightly heaved these results suggest that the recharge process was particularly effective in controlling the ground surface subsidence 5 analyses of the twin well combined recharge test results the twin well combined recharge test was conducted to investigate the effect of the periodic operation of the spare recharge well on the ability to control the surrounding subsidence when the main recharge well required pumping during the test the c1 well was pumped to simulate a clogged main recharge well and the h1 well was recharged to simulate the spare recharge well c1 and h1 were opened at the same time and the water levels in the observation wells became stable after 10 h the pumping rate of the c1 well and recharge rate of the h1 well were both stabilized at 0 8 1 m3 h the time history curves of the head levels in the observation wells during the tests are shown in fig 20 as shown in fig 20 when the water levels became stable the levels in the wells closer to the recharge well specifically g1 g2 g3 and g6 increased by 0 4 0 26 0 12 and 0 15 m respectively whereas the drawdown in the well close to the pumping well g5 was 0 13 m when a nearby well was recharged the drawdown caused by pumping c1 was effectively controlled additionally the change in the water level caused by the simultaneous recharge and pumping processes during the test was basically equal to the superposition of the water level rise of h1 and drawdown of c1 as shown in fig 21 the test results verified the effectiveness of the twin well recharge technique 6 conclusions and recommendations single well twin well and multiwell tests of pumping and recharge in the second semiconfined aquifer were conducted at a metro station site in tianjin the shape of the recharge cone under different recharge rates the effect of the recharge pressure and the effect of recharge on subsidence control were analyzed the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 recharge tests with and without pressure showed that it is feasible to recharge a semiconfined aquifer with a relatively low conductivity coefficient such as an aquifer with silt and silty sand layers additionally the pressured recharge can remarkably improve the efficiency of the recharge process 2 the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the pumping tests could be used to predict the water level rise during single well recharge however the predicted results underestimated the water level rise near the recharge well within 7 m by approximately 10 25 likely because the permeability coefficient of the aquifer around the well is reduced during recharge because of fine particle clogging in practical engineering when only the hydrogeological parameters obtained from pumping tests are available these parameters can be used to design the recharge scheme however the water level rise near the recharge well should be adjusted 3 ground surface uplift increased with increasing recharge rate during the pumping and recharge processes the change in surface subsidence lagged behind the change in the water level by approximately 0 5 d this difference was mainly because the pore pressure dissipation and development of vertical deformation in the clay or silty clay layers were slower than the water level change in the confined layer in addition the ground surface rapidly subsided when the recharge rate was reduced or when recharge stopped therefore in practical engineering it should be appropriate to extend the recharge time and gradually reduce the recharge rate after the pumping is stopped to gradually stabilize the water level and avoid the rapid development of subsidence 4 artificial recharge measures can effectively control the groundwater level and ground subsidence during pumping in a deep excavation project in practice the recharge process should simultaneously begin with pumping and the gross recharge rate and gross pumping rate should be maintained at a similar level additionally the water treatment device that is on site can be used to treat the groundwater extracted during excavation then the treated water can be recharged to its original confined aquifer to avoid groundwater resource waste 5 in practical engineering when a recharge well becomes clogged and requires pumping the twin well combined recharge technique can be adopted to avoid water level drawdown in the twin well technique the recharge wells are closely arranged and in pairs when a recharge well requires pumping another recharge well can be simultaneously opened to control the water level acknowledgement this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51508382 and
