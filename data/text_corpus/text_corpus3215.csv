16075,flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is viewed as a potential alternative to the current state of the art electrodriven technology for the desalination of brackish water however the key shortcoming of the fcdi is still the discontinuous nature of the electrode conductive network resulting in low electron transport efficiency and ion adsorption capacity here a novel magnetic field assisted fcdi system termed magnetic fcdi is proposed to enhance brackish water desalination simply by using magnetic activated carbon mac as flow electrodes the results show that the assistance from the magnetic field enables a 78 9 205 enhancement in the average salt removal rate asrr compared with that in the absence of a magnetic field which benefits from the artificial manipulation of the flow electrode transport behavior in long term tests the stable desalination performance of magnetic fcdi was also demonstrated with a stable asrr of 0 70 μmol cm 2 min 1 and energy normalized removed salt enrs of 8 77 μmol j 1 in addition magnetic field also enables the regeneration of the electrode particles from the concentrated electrolyte in summary the findings indicate that the magnetic fcdi is an energy efficient and operation convenient technology for brackish water desalination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization desalination brackish water magnetic field magnetic carbon magnetic separation 1 introduction population growth industrialization and water contamination have led to an enormous challenge of water scarcity in both developing and developed countries lu and elimelech 2021 zhang et al 2020 augmenting water supply by extracting freshwater from a range of unconventional water sources such as seawater brackish groundwater and wastewater effluent is crucial for alleviating global water stress deshmukh et al 2018 patel et al 2020 yao et al 2021 among the available technologies capacitive deionization cdi has attracted increasing attention as the most investigated electrodriven technique that could compete with current pressure or thermal based desalination processes gamaethiralalage et al 2021 patel et al 2020 especially for applications with a low salt concentration yao et al 2021 in a typical cdi system ions are removed from the sandwiched spacer chamber when a moderate cell voltage is applied leading to cations and anions eventually being adsorbed in the electrical double layers edls of the electrode pores cho et al 2017 yang et al 2021 however the limited ion storage capacity of the static electrode in each operational cycle charging and discharging cannot meet the needs of continuous desalination thus classic cdi and cdi variants can function only in an intermittent manner to desalt low salinity water hatzell et al 2014 tang et al 2017 among these technological advancements flow electrode cdi fcdi has received particular attention due to its pseudoinfinite electrosorption capacity he et al 2018 high water recovery ma et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 and high energy efficiency zhang et al 2020 2019 over the past years increasing effort has been devoted to multiple aspects including developing functional electrodes cho et al 2019 lin et al 2020 ma et al 2020 designing novel cell configurations linnartz et al 2020 jinxing ma et al 2020 tang et al 2019 xu et al 2021c 2021a yang et al 2019 and operation strategies jeon et al 2019 ma et al 2019 xu et al 2021d 2021e 2021f understanding fundamental mechanisms liu et al 2020 ma et al 2018 and establishing numerical models lin 2020 mao et al 2021 rommerskirchen et al 2018 wang et al 2019a to further improve the desalination performance of conventional fcdi systems despite great progress the practical application of fcdi is still limited by a number of challenges including i the low ion adsorption rate and low working capacity ii high electronic and ionic resistance choo et al 2017 rommerskirchen et al 2019 iii additional energy consumption required to drive flow electrodes ma et al 2019 k tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 and iv lack of convenient electrode electrolyte separation methods ma et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b one of the key reasons for these problems is the discontinuity of the electrode particles which severely inhibits the penetration of charges typically higher loadings of carbon in the flow electrode allow for a more continuous electron transport network and increase the effective adsorption capacity however this approach also means an increase in slurry viscosity which greatly increases the energy consumption required to drive the flow electrodes thus suspension electrodes with a carbon loading of 5 10 wt have been applied in many fcdi systems to reach a trade off between electronic conductivity and rheological property cho et al 2019 hatzell et al 2015b xu et al 2021f another approach is the addition of moderate mass fraction generally 0 5 3 wt of conductive additives e g carbon black cb carbon nanotubes cnts and graphene gn luo et al 2020 junjun ma et al 2020 k tang et al 2019 xu et al 2021c for example cho et al cho et al 2019 found that cnts can serve as a conducting bridge between neighboring ac particles leading to better connectivity and higher conductivity of the flow electrode network while this strategy is effective and has been adopted by most researchers to date the cost of materials may be prohibitive to consumers compared to ac nonetheless the abovementioned strategies cannot fundamentally make up the discontinuous nature of the conductive network of flow electrodes resulting in a high electronic resistance that is still a few orders of magnitude higher than that of static electrodes cho et al 2019 doornbusch et al 2016 rommerskirchen et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a previous studies also found that the adsorption of ions primarily occurs within a narrow region near the current collector which gives rise to underutilization of the capacity of the available active material dennison et al 2014 linnartz et al 2020 yang et al 2019 therefore developing a new strategy to fully exploit the potential of the flow electrodes has long been a holy grail of the industry as it would considerably improve the desalination efficiency of fcdi and reduce the cost of desalination and wastewater reuse in this study a novel physical manipulation strategy that requires neither additional device reconstruction nor special material requirement is proposed for the purpose of accelerating the electron transport efficiency of flow electrodes specifically the new strategy involving the use of a magnetic field inside the fcdi cell builds a complete electron transport network and increases the available adsorption capacity of fcdi to implement this strategy in practical application magnetic activated carbons macs were synthesized by loading different content of magnetite fe3o4 on carbon surface the results demonstrated that the magnetic carbon particles were concentrated near the current collectors under the magnetic fields placed on both sides of the fcdi cell and the desalination performance of fcdi was enhanced by more than 100 in addition to facilitating electron penetration the magnetic electrode particles after use also can be recovered from the concentrated electrolyte by magnetic separation ma et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b specifically the effect of magnetic intensity electrolyte concentration flow channel depth d on the desalination performance of fcdi with and without magnetic field were evaluated finally the desalination performance and operational stability of the magnetic fcdi system were demonstrated via a long term desalination test coupled with magnetic separation the results indicated that magnetic fcdi is a promising strategy to overcome its performance limitations due to its capability of efficient desalination continuous operation and fast solid liquid separation 2 materials and methods 2 1 magnetic activated carbon preparation for practical application magnetic carbon electrodes were synthesized on a large scale by loading fe3o4 on the surface of ac according to the modified coprecipitation method ma et al 2021 briefly 16 26 g fecl3 6h2o and 6 0 g fecl2 4h2o mole ratio 2 1 were first added to 500 ml milli q water under stirring at room temperature and then mixed with 50 g of ac powder for at least 24 h to reach homogeneity note the mixing process was carried out in a closed container 500 ml and the ultrapure water was used without further purification after the carbon slurry was heated to 80 c 5 0 mol l 1 naoh solution was slowly added to the mixture using a peristaltic pump yz1515x longer china at a constant flow rate of 2 ml min 1 under continuous mechanical stirring after the ph value increased to 10 5 0 1 the carbon slurry was aged under an 80 c water bath for 12 h afterward the precipitate was washed until the supernatant was neutral and the conductivity decreased to below 500 μs cm 1 followed by drying in an oven to obtain mac 1 flow electrodes with higher fe3o4 loading were prepared similarly by increasing the dosage of fe precursors to obtain mac 2 mac 3 and mac 4 as shown in table s1 the actual fe contents in mac 1 mac 2 mac 3 and mac 4 were 8 5 13 6 16 0 and 20 7 wt respectively the control group mac 0 was prepared without adding any fe chemicals in the same way finally the flow electrodes were prepared by mixing 5 0 wt carbon and 95 wt milli q water the reagents and characterization methods are listed in text s1 and text s2 in the supporting information respectively 2 2 experimental setup in all experimental tests a classic three chamber fcdi desalination device was used xu et al 2021a in brief the flow electrode chamber was built using graphite current collectors and acrylic plates carved with a serpentine channel fig s1 the total length of each serpentine channel 2 4 and 6 mm deep and 4 mm wide was 40 0 cm and the effective contact area a eff between the flow electrode and the ion exchange membranes iems was 15 0 cm2 a 100 mesh titanium mesh 56 mm 56 mm 0 15 mm was placed in the spacer chamber located between the anion exchange membrane aem g1204 lvhe china and cation exchange membrane cem g0014 lvhe china note that the titanium mesh can be replaced by traditional non conductive mesh all components were held together with a pair of acrylic endplates thickness 10 mm 2 3 desalination performance test in all experiments synthetic brackish water was pumped into the spacer chambers in single pass mode at constant water productivity of 64 l m 2 h 1 i e flow rate q f 1 6 ml min 1 to simulate long term operation conditions and eliminate the influence of salt concentration changes the flow electrodes with 5 g l 1 nacl as the supporting electrolyte was sequentially pumped into the electrode chambers in sc mode at a constant q ele of 80 ml min 1 in the charging process a pair of cylindrical ndfeb magnets 50 mm 10 mm was placed on both sides of the fcdi cell to provide a magnetic field the magnetic flux b was measured by a teslameter ht20 hengtong china to display the spatial distribution of the magnetic field provided by the permanent magnets a three dimension model of the magnetic field was established by a commercial comsol multiphysics text s3 and fig s2 the current collectors were connected to a dc power supply dp821a rigol china at a constant voltage of 1 2 v considering the inevitable cumulative effect of salt concentration in the electrolyte of the flow electrode long term operation over 2800 min 3 cycles was evaluated using magnetic flow electrodes with 2 g l 1 nacl as the initial supporting electrolyte after each 1000 min of charging the magnets placed on both sides of the fcdi cell were removed artificially and the brine was then separated from the collected flow electrodes using magnetic separation for 5 min and 70 80 of the supernatant was then replaced by the same volume of milli q water the effluent conductivity electrolyte conductivity and current were continuously monitored using conductivity meters con bta and a current sensor dcp bta connected to a data acquisition system lq mini usa the nacl concentration was calculated from measured conductivity fig s3 detailed electrochemical measurement methods were shown in text s4 2 4 calculations the asrr μmol cm 2 min 1 ce and enrs μmol j 1 were calculated as follows 1 a s r r c f c d q f m a eff 2 c e f c f c d q f t m 0 t i d t 3 e n r s c f c d q f t m u 0 t i d t where c f and c d are the salt concentrations in feed stream and effluent respectively m is the molar mass of nacl t is the charging time f is the faraday constant i is the instant current and u is the applied cell voltage other calculation methods are showed in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of magnetic activated carbon the sem images of mac particles fig 1 a and fig s4 show a blocky structure with a uniform particle size of 5 15 μm compared with the smooth surface of bare ac i e mac 0 a large number of mineral particles were successfully loaded on the surface of ac and the particle size was below 100 nm according to the eds elemental mapping images of mac samples fig 1a and fig s5 more areas of the carbon surface are covered by fe and o as the content of fe increases as shown in the powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns fig 1b the diffraction patterns of mac 3 and mac 4 can be well indexed to magnetite fe3o4 jcpds no 19 0629 feng et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b in contrast to the results for bare ac particle the magnetization curves of the mac 3 and mac 4 fig 1c exhibit typical hysteresis loops with magnetic saturation magnetization values reaching up to 10 emu g 1 due to the generation of magnetite wang et al 2019b in contrast iron oxides hematite jcpds no 33 0664 and hydroxide goethite jcpds no 29 0713 are more easily formed under a low fe content fig 1b wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 since only a small amount of fe was transformed to magnetite mac 1 and mac 2 exhibited low magnetization values fig 1c as a result the four mac materials respond very differently to magnetic fields fig s6 and video s2 the elemental states of fe and o in the as synthesized mac samples were also examined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps figs 1f and 1g the fe 2p spectra exhibited two fe oriented bands 2p3 2 at 710 6 ev and 2p1 2 at 724 3 ev and two characteristic satellite bands 718 8 and 732 8 ev wang et al 2019b the fitted fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 peaks at 710 4 and 724 0 ev respectively were assigned to fe2 species while those at higher binding energies 712 2 and 725 8 ev were attributed to fe3 species xu et al 2020 in addition the o 1s spectra could be split into three components centered at 529 2 529 6 531 1 and 532 6 v corresponding to fe o c o and c o respectively wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the center peaks of fe o in mac 1 mac 2 and mac 3 4 were 529 2 529 5 and 529 6 respectively and this slight peak shift can be explained by the mineral transformation of fe composites on the carbon surface however the content of oh groups on the ac surface significantly increased after fe loading due to the inevitable generation of iron hydroxide the surface area and pore structure of the mac samples were investigated by measuring the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms figs s7 a b show that the brunauer emmett teller bet surface areas of mac samples decreased from 2023 2 to 1133 3 m2 g 1 as the fe loading increased due to the decrease in the surface area of micropores figs 1e although the mesopore 2 50 nm volume fig s7c and average pore size fig 1d of mac increased with the addition of fe due to the coating of fe minerals on the surface of carbon particle fig 1a the contribution of mesopores to the surface area of mac was negligible fig 1e and fig s7d to further evaluate the surface area variation of the ac electrodes after modification the normalized surface areas of mac were calculated by eq s1 as shown in fig 1d the normalized surface areas of mac only decreased by 21 2 as the iron content increased from 8 5 to 20 7 wt fig s8 it is no surprise that the introduction of fe3o4 onto the carbon particle surface resulted in a decrease in the surface area especially in the micropore area zhang et al 2021b in addition the formation of carbon iron pores may also contribute to the surface area of micropores 3 2 enhancing fcdi desalination using a magnetic field in the experimental tests the mac electrodes v ele 50 ml circulated between the flow electrode chambers and the external reservoir fig 2 a after 100 s of charging without a magnetic field applied a pair of circular permanent magnets with a diameter of 50 mm was artificially attached to the sides of the fcdi cell figs 2a and 2b the readers can refer to video s1 for the detailed operation process note that the magnetic field was applied or removed every 100 s and a total of 10 cycles were tested the magnetic intensity of the electrode chamber provided by the magnets was measured as shown in fig 2c the b value decreased with the distance from the center point maximum b 92 mt increased and decreased to zero when the radius increased to 40 mm which are in good agreement with the simulation results of comsol multiphysics fig 2d in addition the simulation results fig s9 also showed that the b decreases slightly as the depth d of the flow channel increases thus under the force of magnetic field the magnetic electrode particles will move towards the magnet on the same side when a magnetic field was applied an obvious increase in the instant current density j of the fcdi cell was attained for macs with different fe contents fig 2e notably the response current was positively correlated with the magnetic strength of macs fig 1c that is the stronger the magnetic properties were the more j increased despite the generation of different fe minerals on carbon surface at different preparation conditions fig 1b for example only 20 improvement in j in mac 2 scenario was attained when a magnetic field was provided while a more than 150 improvement was achieved in mac 3 scenario moreover the instant effluent conductivity in all magnetic carbon scenarios showed a sinusoidal like variation fig 2f as the magnetic field switched periodically as expected the magnitude of the change in effluent conductivities corresponded exactly to the change in j value fig s10 and fig s11 among these scenarios mac 3 showed a higher salt removal performance than other conditions when a magnetic field was applied leading to the effluent conductivity decreasing from 1 98 without a magnetic field to 1 86 ms cm 1 fig 2f during the 10 cycles both j and the conductivity showed a repeatable variation and no performance degradation was observed since the modified materials showed a decrease in the surface area fig 1d compared with bare ac the magnetic fcdi with different mac electrodes showed more or less j decrease in the absence of magnetic field fig 2d for example the j of mac 1 and mac 2 were 1 65 and 2 04 a m 2 respectively much lower than that of the mac 0 scenario j 2 4 a m 2 this result can be ascribed to the high resistance of hematite and goethite mac 1 and mac 2 that result in a low electron transport efficiency between mac particles varshney and yogi 2011 in comparison the magnetite phase mac 3 and mac 4 provided a lower electrical resistivity for electron transport itai et al 1971 figs 2 g and fig s12 showed the in situ cyclic voltammetry cv results performed in a one chamber cell fig s1 at the same experimental conditions the specific measurement method is described in text s3 these cv curves exhibit good capacitance characteristics with symmetric shapes without any obvious redox peaks indicating ideal edl adsorption and highly reversible ion adsorption desorption characteristics srimuk et al 2017 the specific capacitances of fcdi system operated under different mac scenarios were calculated eq s2 at a scan rate of 10 mv s 1 and the result is shown in fig 2h due to the decreased surface area fig 1d and the increase in charge percolation resistance fig s13 the calculated working capacitance of different mac samples for salt removal decreased compared with that of the single ac scenario when a magnetic field was provided the capacitance of the fcdi system loaded with mac significantly increased fig 2h especially for mac 3 and mac 4 in desalination test the j of mac 4 was lower than that of mac 3 which may be related to the decreased stability of iron mineral as excessive fe loaded on carbon surface 3 3 effect of salt concentration on desalination performance to simulate the accumulation of salt in the electrolyte the effect of various salt concentrations c b 0 41 10 1 g l 1 on the desalination performance of magnetic fcdi was evaluated as shown in fig s14 the salt removal performance of fcdi with and without magnetic field sharply increased as the initial salt concentration in the flow electrodes increased the results can be explained by the decrease of ionic resistance yang et al 2016 the results of nyquist plots fig s14 indicated the in situ equivalent series resistance esr i e the ionic resistance and interfacial resistance decreased from 16 9 to 4 1 ω with nacl concentration increased from 1 5 to 5 0 g l 1 fig 3 a shows that the asrrs calculated by eq 1 obtained at magnetic field are 2 04 2 78 times higher than those in the absence of a magnetic field although the effective capacitance significantly increased after providing a magnetic field fig s12 no difference was observed in the ionic resistance fig s15 furthermore the settling velocity sv of the flow electrodes and the turbidity of the supernatant were measured at a low nacl concentration c b 0 41 g l 1 the electrode particles were uniformly dispersed in the solution after 8 minutes of gravitational sedimentation fig 3b as the nacl concentration increased to 1 47 g l 1 the sv and turbidity obviously decreased to 45 and 840 ntu from 3200 ntu respectively with increasing nacl concentration the settling performance of the flow electrodes was further improved as evidenced by xps patterns fig 1g zeta potential fig 3c and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir fig s16 the surface of ac electrodes before and after fe loading contained a large number of oxygen functional groups i e oh and cooh thus the enhanced desalting efficiency at a high nacl concentration can also be attributed to the increase in collision frequency between carbon particles as electrostatic repulsion decreased here the effect of salt concentration can be explained by the classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory hermansson 1999 hoek and agarwal 2006 when the salt concentration is very low the repulsive force between electrode particles makes the flow electrodes stable suspension stability is indicative of low aggregation and a relatively monodisperse distribution of the electrode material hatzell et al 2015b when a magnetic field was applied fig 3d the electrostatic interaction between electrode particles was negligible compared with the magnetic force and the flow electrodes in the flow channel aggregated rapidly resulting in collision and aggregation behaviors that form interconnected particle networks for efficient charge transfer duduta et al 2011 wang et al 2020a once the aggregated electrodes were out of the magnetic field lower salt concentration was more conducive to the dispersion of the electrode particles as a result of electrostatic repulsion although an increase in salt concentration in the flow electrode is beneficial to salt removal energy efficiency and stability should also be considered in determining the optimal concentration or terminal concentration when the initial nacl concentration increased to 10 1 g l 1 obvious decreases in charge efficiency were observed with and without magnetic field and thereby caused a decrease in enrs fig s17 this result can be explained by the counterion back diffusion and co ion leakage from the electrode chamber to the spacer chamber moreno and hatzell 2018 porada et al 2014 with an increase in the salt concentration higher pumping energy and lower system stability are also expected to occur with the aggregation of carbon particles fig s18 thus it is recommended to replace the electrolyte in time when operating fcdi for a long time 3 4 effect of channel depth and carbon content narrow flow channels and high carbon content are conducive to the salt removal performance of fcdi but all of these strategies pose a risk of channel clogging hatzell et al 2015b rommerskirchen et al 2019 xu et al 2021c when the flow rate is constant a narrow flow channel allows for higher velocity generally the average velocity f can be calculated as follow f q f a cro q f w d where a cro is the cross sectional area of the flow channel w is the width of the channel and d is the depth of the channel here the calculated f values at d values of 2 4 and 6 mm are 10 0 7 5 and 5 0 m min 1 respectively figs 4 a and 4b show the variations of j and effluent conductivity of fcdi at different channel depths and carbon contents under switching magnetic field it was clearly observed that a lower d and or higher carbon content was favorable to the desalination performance of fcdi at a higher carbon content electron transport can be enhanced as more frequent collisions between ac particles wang et al 2020b in addition the ionic resistance of fcdi cell obviously decreased with the reduction in the distance for ion transport fig s19 furthermore continuous desalination tests were evaluated fig s20 and the calculated asrr was shown in fig 4c in the absence of a magnetic field the asrr increased by 75 4 115 8 as the carbon content increased from 5 to 10 wt irrespective of d and f in addition asrr increased by 100 3 and 69 5 for carbon contents of 5 and 10 wt respectively as d decreased from 6 to 2 mm these results are consistent with many previous studies hatzell et al 2015b ma et al 2018 xu et al 2021f yang et al 2019 when a magnetic field is applied the local carbon concentration near the current collector was expected much higher than that of the bulk flow electrode doornbusch et al 2016 as shown in fig 4c the asrr of fcdi with 5 wt carbon increased by 205 0 213 6 and 86 at d values of 6 4 and 2 mm respectively at d 2 mm high velocity f 10 m min 1 may cause fresh electrode particles to rush out of the flow channel quickly and not conducive to the formation of charge percolation network in comparison under a carbon content of 10 wt the enhancement in asrr caused by the magnetic field only reached 78 9 126 8 previous studies hatzell et al 2015a liang et al 2017 rommerskirchen et al 2019 have demonstrated the increase in the ionic and electronic conductivities as the carbon content increase due to the formation of conductive electrode networks as a result the nyquist plots showed a smaller slope at lower frequencies fig s19 however channel clogging is more likely to occur in a narrow flow channel and high carbon content fig 4 d indicated the viscosity of the flow electrodes increased as carbon content increase for instance at d 2 mm and carbon content 10 wt the j increased from 12 5 to 16 0 a m 2 after 30 min operation fig s20 therefore a carbon content of 10 wt and a d value of 4 mm were chosen as the optimal operating conditions for the magnetic fcdi system at such a condition the asrr was 1 6 times higher than at d 2 mm without magnetic field and reached 82 of the asrr at d 2 mm with a magnetic field 3 5 desalination mechanisms of magnetic fcdi in contrast to the normal condition in which the flow electrodes are evenly distributed in the electrode chambers the mac particles were concentrated near the current collector surface under the magnetic field fig 3d the aggregation of flow electrodes means that electrons can transport between the electrode particles more easily increasing the available adsorption capacity for ion storage the principle is similar to the equivalent film electrode efe model recently proposed by wang et al wang et al 2020b where the flow electrode stream can be approximated as a film electrode with a much larger macropore volume and significantly reduced electrical conductivity although the working capacitance of the dispersed flow electrodes is one or two orders of magnitude lower than that of static electrodes hand et al 2019 rommerskirchen et al 2019 shen et al 2020 magnetic field enables faster electrode collision and accelerates electron transport between the electrode particles when the agglomerated electrode particles left the magnetic field the disturbance of water flow and the repulsion between electrode particles made the flow electrode recover to the uniform state which enables continuous and stable desalination of fcdi in addition the introduction of magnetic field can also accelerate the charge compensation effect and improve the electrode regeneration efficiency the regeneration of the flow electrodes in the flow channel in sc mode was recently demonstrated to be beneficial to desalination efficiency junjun ma et al 2020 xu et al 2021b when the negatively charged flow electrodes i e na carbon enter the anode chamber the ions stored in the edls of electrode particles are released instantaneously in two ways fig 3d i co ions are expelled from the pores when the electrode particles contact the anode current collector and ii charge compensation occurs when electrode particles with opposite polarity come into contact and the stored ions both anions and cations leave the electrode surface by passive diffusion these processes were enhanced by the magnetic field enabling efficient electrode regeneration 3 6 evaluation of the fcdi system under magnetic field in long term operation to verify the desalination performance of the magnetic fcdi system in long term operation semi continuous operation for 2800 min 3 cycles was performed coupled with magnetic separation for electrode regeneration it has been demonstrated that magnetic separation is more efficient and convenient than sedimentation and membrane filtration processes for electrode regeneration and concentrated electrolyte discharge ma et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b 2019 fig 5 a shows the changes in j and effluent conductivity in 3 operation cycles j gradually increased as the charging time increased at the beginning of the deionization processes due to the increase in salt concentration in the electrolyte fig 5b a detailed explanation regarding the effect of salt concentration can be found in section 3 3 when the electrolyte conductivity was higher than 10 ms cm 1 various parameters such as j effluent conductivity and asrr gradually stabilized nevertheless a slight decrease in the desalination performance of fcdi was found when the conductivity of the electrolyte increased to 20 ms cm 1 the phenomenon was consistent with the abovementioned results that the charge efficiency decreased as salt concentration increased 10 g l 1 thus after 1000 min of operation the concentrated electrolyte was separated from the flow electrodes by magnetic separation compared to the efficiency under gravity separation the separation efficiency increased by approximately 150 with the assistance of a magnetic field leading to a decrease in the solid volume from 50 to 18 ml after 2 min fig 5c and video s3 after a total of 5 min of settling 70 80 of the electrolyte supernatant was replaced by the same volume of deionized water in brief the results demonstrated that magnetic fcdi has stable and efficient desalination performance in continuous operation that is fig s21 the ce enrs sec and tee values over 3 cycles are maintained at 101 6 8 77 μmol j 1 0 18 kwh m 3 and 9 7 respectively notably the magnetic fcdi system achieves a stable asrr of 0 70 μmol cm 2 min 1 which is 201 1 that of the desalination process in the absence of a magnetic field fig s22 3 7 performance comparisons of magnetic fcdi with previous works fig 4g shows a detailed comparison of magnetic fcdi with conventional fcdi systems for salt removal from brackish water doornbusch et al 2016 luo et al 2020 ma et al 2020 ma et al 2021 rommerskirchen et al 2015 xu et al 2021c yang et al 2019 to improve the comparability all data collected from previous studies were obtained under scc or sc modes under similar experimental conditions such as u 1 2 v carbon content 10 wt initial salt concentration 2000 mg l 1 concentration reduction 25 mm water productivity 100 l m 2 h 1 using a single chamber fcdi system table s2 the energy consumption was limited to 8 μmol j 1 at u 1 2 v for most studies generally obtained with short term tests it should be noted that the data from previous studies were mainly obtained in short term experiments and thus the results may be overcalculated in this study a stable enrs of 8 77 μmol j 1 and asrr 0 70 μmol cm 2 min 1 was obtained in a long term test 2800 min indicating the energy efficiency advantage of the magnetic fcdi compared with conventional systems compared with flow electrodes with ac alone flow electrodes containing various conductive additives such as cnts and cb mass fraction 1 2 5 wt are more favorable to electroadsorption luo et al 2020 ma et al 2020 tang et al 2019 xu et al 2021c although magnetic carbon has no advantage over these electrode materials in terms of electroconductivity it achieves a significant increase in asrr with the assistance of a magnetic field more importantly the coupling of magnetic field and magnetic carbon can not only improve desalination performance but also facilitate solid liquid separation thus killing two birds with one stone it is also expected that the desalination performance of magnetic fcdi can be further improved by improving the electroconductivity of the flow electrodes 4 conclusions the results of this study show that an assisted magnetic field enables a significant enhancement in the desalination performance of fcdi compared with conventional operation strategies under a magnetic field the dispersed electrode particles aggregated near the current collector surface and form a more concentrated electrode flow thereby realizing complete exploitation of the adsorption capacity of the flow electrodes benefiting from the formation of a continuous electron transport network a significant enhancement in asrr 78 9 205 was attained with the assistance from the magnetic field compared with that in the absence of a magnetic field in long term tests the stable desalination performance of magnetic fcdi was also demonstrated with a stable asrr of 0 70 μmol cm 2 min 1 and enrs of 8 77 μmol j 1 in addition to the enhancement in desalination performance the beneficial effect of the magnetic field is also demonstrated in the separation of the electrode particles from the concentrated electrolyte during continuous operation in summary a novel strategy has been developed here to enhance the desalination performance of fcdi and accelerate electrode electrolyte separation by using an auxiliary magnetic field and magnetic carbon electrode credit authorship contribution statement longqian xu conceptualization writing original draft methodology visualization

16075,flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is viewed as a potential alternative to the current state of the art electrodriven technology for the desalination of brackish water however the key shortcoming of the fcdi is still the discontinuous nature of the electrode conductive network resulting in low electron transport efficiency and ion adsorption capacity here a novel magnetic field assisted fcdi system termed magnetic fcdi is proposed to enhance brackish water desalination simply by using magnetic activated carbon mac as flow electrodes the results show that the assistance from the magnetic field enables a 78 9 205 enhancement in the average salt removal rate asrr compared with that in the absence of a magnetic field which benefits from the artificial manipulation of the flow electrode transport behavior in long term tests the stable desalination performance of magnetic fcdi was also demonstrated with a stable asrr of 0 70 μmol cm 2 min 1 and energy normalized removed salt enrs of 8 77 μmol j 1 in addition magnetic field also enables the regeneration of the electrode particles from the concentrated electrolyte in summary the findings indicate that the magnetic fcdi is an energy efficient and operation convenient technology for brackish water desalination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization desalination brackish water magnetic field magnetic carbon magnetic separation 1 introduction population growth industrialization and water contamination have led to an enormous challenge of water scarcity in both developing and developed countries lu and elimelech 2021 zhang et al 2020 augmenting water supply by extracting freshwater from a range of unconventional water sources such as seawater brackish groundwater and wastewater effluent is crucial for alleviating global water stress deshmukh et al 2018 patel et al 2020 yao et al 2021 among the available technologies capacitive deionization cdi has attracted increasing attention as the most investigated electrodriven technique that could compete with current pressure or thermal based desalination processes gamaethiralalage et al 2021 patel et al 2020 especially for applications with a low salt concentration yao et al 2021 in a typical cdi system ions are removed from the sandwiched spacer chamber when a moderate cell voltage is applied leading to cations and anions eventually being adsorbed in the electrical double layers edls of the electrode pores cho et al 2017 yang et al 2021 however the limited ion storage capacity of the static electrode in each operational cycle charging and discharging cannot meet the needs of continuous desalination thus classic cdi and cdi variants can function only in an intermittent manner to desalt low salinity water hatzell et al 2014 tang et al 2017 among these technological advancements flow electrode cdi fcdi has received particular attention due to its pseudoinfinite electrosorption capacity he et al 2018 high water recovery ma et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 and high energy efficiency zhang et al 2020 2019 over the past years increasing effort has been devoted to multiple aspects including developing functional electrodes cho et al 2019 lin et al 2020 ma et al 2020 designing novel cell configurations linnartz et al 2020 jinxing ma et al 2020 tang et al 2019 xu et al 2021c 2021a yang et al 2019 and operation strategies jeon et al 2019 ma et al 2019 xu et al 2021d 2021e 2021f understanding fundamental mechanisms liu et al 2020 ma et al 2018 and establishing numerical models lin 2020 mao et al 2021 rommerskirchen et al 2018 wang et al 2019a to further improve the desalination performance of conventional fcdi systems despite great progress the practical application of fcdi is still limited by a number of challenges including i the low ion adsorption rate and low working capacity ii high electronic and ionic resistance choo et al 2017 rommerskirchen et al 2019 iii additional energy consumption required to drive flow electrodes ma et al 2019 k tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 and iv lack of convenient electrode electrolyte separation methods ma et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b one of the key reasons for these problems is the discontinuity of the electrode particles which severely inhibits the penetration of charges typically higher loadings of carbon in the flow electrode allow for a more continuous electron transport network and increase the effective adsorption capacity however this approach also means an increase in slurry viscosity which greatly increases the energy consumption required to drive the flow electrodes thus suspension electrodes with a carbon loading of 5 10 wt have been applied in many fcdi systems to reach a trade off between electronic conductivity and rheological property cho et al 2019 hatzell et al 2015b xu et al 2021f another approach is the addition of moderate mass fraction generally 0 5 3 wt of conductive additives e g carbon black cb carbon nanotubes cnts and graphene gn luo et al 2020 junjun ma et al 2020 k tang et al 2019 xu et al 2021c for example cho et al cho et al 2019 found that cnts can serve as a conducting bridge between neighboring ac particles leading to better connectivity and higher conductivity of the flow electrode network while this strategy is effective and has been adopted by most researchers to date the cost of materials may be prohibitive to consumers compared to ac nonetheless the abovementioned strategies cannot fundamentally make up the discontinuous nature of the conductive network of flow electrodes resulting in a high electronic resistance that is still a few orders of magnitude higher than that of static electrodes cho et al 2019 doornbusch et al 2016 rommerskirchen et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a previous studies also found that the adsorption of ions primarily occurs within a narrow region near the current collector which gives rise to underutilization of the capacity of the available active material dennison et al 2014 linnartz et al 2020 yang et al 2019 therefore developing a new strategy to fully exploit the potential of the flow electrodes has long been a holy grail of the industry as it would considerably improve the desalination efficiency of fcdi and reduce the cost of desalination and wastewater reuse in this study a novel physical manipulation strategy that requires neither additional device reconstruction nor special material requirement is proposed for the purpose of accelerating the electron transport efficiency of flow electrodes specifically the new strategy involving the use of a magnetic field inside the fcdi cell builds a complete electron transport network and increases the available adsorption capacity of fcdi to implement this strategy in practical application magnetic activated carbons macs were synthesized by loading different content of magnetite fe3o4 on carbon surface the results demonstrated that the magnetic carbon particles were concentrated near the current collectors under the magnetic fields placed on both sides of the fcdi cell and the desalination performance of fcdi was enhanced by more than 100 in addition to facilitating electron penetration the magnetic electrode particles after use also can be recovered from the concentrated electrolyte by magnetic separation ma et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b specifically the effect of magnetic intensity electrolyte concentration flow channel depth d on the desalination performance of fcdi with and without magnetic field were evaluated finally the desalination performance and operational stability of the magnetic fcdi system were demonstrated via a long term desalination test coupled with magnetic separation the results indicated that magnetic fcdi is a promising strategy to overcome its performance limitations due to its capability of efficient desalination continuous operation and fast solid liquid separation 2 materials and methods 2 1 magnetic activated carbon preparation for practical application magnetic carbon electrodes were synthesized on a large scale by loading fe3o4 on the surface of ac according to the modified coprecipitation method ma et al 2021 briefly 16 26 g fecl3 6h2o and 6 0 g fecl2 4h2o mole ratio 2 1 were first added to 500 ml milli q water under stirring at room temperature and then mixed with 50 g of ac powder for at least 24 h to reach homogeneity note the mixing process was carried out in a closed container 500 ml and the ultrapure water was used without further purification after the carbon slurry was heated to 80 c 5 0 mol l 1 naoh solution was slowly added to the mixture using a peristaltic pump yz1515x longer china at a constant flow rate of 2 ml min 1 under continuous mechanical stirring after the ph value increased to 10 5 0 1 the carbon slurry was aged under an 80 c water bath for 12 h afterward the precipitate was washed until the supernatant was neutral and the conductivity decreased to below 500 μs cm 1 followed by drying in an oven to obtain mac 1 flow electrodes with higher fe3o4 loading were prepared similarly by increasing the dosage of fe precursors to obtain mac 2 mac 3 and mac 4 as shown in table s1 the actual fe contents in mac 1 mac 2 mac 3 and mac 4 were 8 5 13 6 16 0 and 20 7 wt respectively the control group mac 0 was prepared without adding any fe chemicals in the same way finally the flow electrodes were prepared by mixing 5 0 wt carbon and 95 wt milli q water the reagents and characterization methods are listed in text s1 and text s2 in the supporting information respectively 2 2 experimental setup in all experimental tests a classic three chamber fcdi desalination device was used xu et al 2021a in brief the flow electrode chamber was built using graphite current collectors and acrylic plates carved with a serpentine channel fig s1 the total length of each serpentine channel 2 4 and 6 mm deep and 4 mm wide was 40 0 cm and the effective contact area a eff between the flow electrode and the ion exchange membranes iems was 15 0 cm2 a 100 mesh titanium mesh 56 mm 56 mm 0 15 mm was placed in the spacer chamber located between the anion exchange membrane aem g1204 lvhe china and cation exchange membrane cem g0014 lvhe china note that the titanium mesh can be replaced by traditional non conductive mesh all components were held together with a pair of acrylic endplates thickness 10 mm 2 3 desalination performance test in all experiments synthetic brackish water was pumped into the spacer chambers in single pass mode at constant water productivity of 64 l m 2 h 1 i e flow rate q f 1 6 ml min 1 to simulate long term operation conditions and eliminate the influence of salt concentration changes the flow electrodes with 5 g l 1 nacl as the supporting electrolyte was sequentially pumped into the electrode chambers in sc mode at a constant q ele of 80 ml min 1 in the charging process a pair of cylindrical ndfeb magnets 50 mm 10 mm was placed on both sides of the fcdi cell to provide a magnetic field the magnetic flux b was measured by a teslameter ht20 hengtong china to display the spatial distribution of the magnetic field provided by the permanent magnets a three dimension model of the magnetic field was established by a commercial comsol multiphysics text s3 and fig s2 the current collectors were connected to a dc power supply dp821a rigol china at a constant voltage of 1 2 v considering the inevitable cumulative effect of salt concentration in the electrolyte of the flow electrode long term operation over 2800 min 3 cycles was evaluated using magnetic flow electrodes with 2 g l 1 nacl as the initial supporting electrolyte after each 1000 min of charging the magnets placed on both sides of the fcdi cell were removed artificially and the brine was then separated from the collected flow electrodes using magnetic separation for 5 min and 70 80 of the supernatant was then replaced by the same volume of milli q water the effluent conductivity electrolyte conductivity and current were continuously monitored using conductivity meters con bta and a current sensor dcp bta connected to a data acquisition system lq mini usa the nacl concentration was calculated from measured conductivity fig s3 detailed electrochemical measurement methods were shown in text s4 2 4 calculations the asrr μmol cm 2 min 1 ce and enrs μmol j 1 were calculated as follows 1 a s r r c f c d q f m a eff 2 c e f c f c d q f t m 0 t i d t 3 e n r s c f c d q f t m u 0 t i d t where c f and c d are the salt concentrations in feed stream and effluent respectively m is the molar mass of nacl t is the charging time f is the faraday constant i is the instant current and u is the applied cell voltage other calculation methods are showed in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of magnetic activated carbon the sem images of mac particles fig 1 a and fig s4 show a blocky structure with a uniform particle size of 5 15 μm compared with the smooth surface of bare ac i e mac 0 a large number of mineral particles were successfully loaded on the surface of ac and the particle size was below 100 nm according to the eds elemental mapping images of mac samples fig 1a and fig s5 more areas of the carbon surface are covered by fe and o as the content of fe increases as shown in the powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns fig 1b the diffraction patterns of mac 3 and mac 4 can be well indexed to magnetite fe3o4 jcpds no 19 0629 feng et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b in contrast to the results for bare ac particle the magnetization curves of the mac 3 and mac 4 fig 1c exhibit typical hysteresis loops with magnetic saturation magnetization values reaching up to 10 emu g 1 due to the generation of magnetite wang et al 2019b in contrast iron oxides hematite jcpds no 33 0664 and hydroxide goethite jcpds no 29 0713 are more easily formed under a low fe content fig 1b wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 since only a small amount of fe was transformed to magnetite mac 1 and mac 2 exhibited low magnetization values fig 1c as a result the four mac materials respond very differently to magnetic fields fig s6 and video s2 the elemental states of fe and o in the as synthesized mac samples were also examined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps figs 1f and 1g the fe 2p spectra exhibited two fe oriented bands 2p3 2 at 710 6 ev and 2p1 2 at 724 3 ev and two characteristic satellite bands 718 8 and 732 8 ev wang et al 2019b the fitted fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 peaks at 710 4 and 724 0 ev respectively were assigned to fe2 species while those at higher binding energies 712 2 and 725 8 ev were attributed to fe3 species xu et al 2020 in addition the o 1s spectra could be split into three components centered at 529 2 529 6 531 1 and 532 6 v corresponding to fe o c o and c o respectively wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the center peaks of fe o in mac 1 mac 2 and mac 3 4 were 529 2 529 5 and 529 6 respectively and this slight peak shift can be explained by the mineral transformation of fe composites on the carbon surface however the content of oh groups on the ac surface significantly increased after fe loading due to the inevitable generation of iron hydroxide the surface area and pore structure of the mac samples were investigated by measuring the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms figs s7 a b show that the brunauer emmett teller bet surface areas of mac samples decreased from 2023 2 to 1133 3 m2 g 1 as the fe loading increased due to the decrease in the surface area of micropores figs 1e although the mesopore 2 50 nm volume fig s7c and average pore size fig 1d of mac increased with the addition of fe due to the coating of fe minerals on the surface of carbon particle fig 1a the contribution of mesopores to the surface area of mac was negligible fig 1e and fig s7d to further evaluate the surface area variation of the ac electrodes after modification the normalized surface areas of mac were calculated by eq s1 as shown in fig 1d the normalized surface areas of mac only decreased by 21 2 as the iron content increased from 8 5 to 20 7 wt fig s8 it is no surprise that the introduction of fe3o4 onto the carbon particle surface resulted in a decrease in the surface area especially in the micropore area zhang et al 2021b in addition the formation of carbon iron pores may also contribute to the surface area of micropores 3 2 enhancing fcdi desalination using a magnetic field in the experimental tests the mac electrodes v ele 50 ml circulated between the flow electrode chambers and the external reservoir fig 2 a after 100 s of charging without a magnetic field applied a pair of circular permanent magnets with a diameter of 50 mm was artificially attached to the sides of the fcdi cell figs 2a and 2b the readers can refer to video s1 for the detailed operation process note that the magnetic field was applied or removed every 100 s and a total of 10 cycles were tested the magnetic intensity of the electrode chamber provided by the magnets was measured as shown in fig 2c the b value decreased with the distance from the center point maximum b 92 mt increased and decreased to zero when the radius increased to 40 mm which are in good agreement with the simulation results of comsol multiphysics fig 2d in addition the simulation results fig s9 also showed that the b decreases slightly as the depth d of the flow channel increases thus under the force of magnetic field the magnetic electrode particles will move towards the magnet on the same side when a magnetic field was applied an obvious increase in the instant current density j of the fcdi cell was attained for macs with different fe contents fig 2e notably the response current was positively correlated with the magnetic strength of macs fig 1c that is the stronger the magnetic properties were the more j increased despite the generation of different fe minerals on carbon surface at different preparation conditions fig 1b for example only 20 improvement in j in mac 2 scenario was attained when a magnetic field was provided while a more than 150 improvement was achieved in mac 3 scenario moreover the instant effluent conductivity in all magnetic carbon scenarios showed a sinusoidal like variation fig 2f as the magnetic field switched periodically as expected the magnitude of the change in effluent conductivities corresponded exactly to the change in j value fig s10 and fig s11 among these scenarios mac 3 showed a higher salt removal performance than other conditions when a magnetic field was applied leading to the effluent conductivity decreasing from 1 98 without a magnetic field to 1 86 ms cm 1 fig 2f during the 10 cycles both j and the conductivity showed a repeatable variation and no performance degradation was observed since the modified materials showed a decrease in the surface area fig 1d compared with bare ac the magnetic fcdi with different mac electrodes showed more or less j decrease in the absence of magnetic field fig 2d for example the j of mac 1 and mac 2 were 1 65 and 2 04 a m 2 respectively much lower than that of the mac 0 scenario j 2 4 a m 2 this result can be ascribed to the high resistance of hematite and goethite mac 1 and mac 2 that result in a low electron transport efficiency between mac particles varshney and yogi 2011 in comparison the magnetite phase mac 3 and mac 4 provided a lower electrical resistivity for electron transport itai et al 1971 figs 2 g and fig s12 showed the in situ cyclic voltammetry cv results performed in a one chamber cell fig s1 at the same experimental conditions the specific measurement method is described in text s3 these cv curves exhibit good capacitance characteristics with symmetric shapes without any obvious redox peaks indicating ideal edl adsorption and highly reversible ion adsorption desorption characteristics srimuk et al 2017 the specific capacitances of fcdi system operated under different mac scenarios were calculated eq s2 at a scan rate of 10 mv s 1 and the result is shown in fig 2h due to the decreased surface area fig 1d and the increase in charge percolation resistance fig s13 the calculated working capacitance of different mac samples for salt removal decreased compared with that of the single ac scenario when a magnetic field was provided the capacitance of the fcdi system loaded with mac significantly increased fig 2h especially for mac 3 and mac 4 in desalination test the j of mac 4 was lower than that of mac 3 which may be related to the decreased stability of iron mineral as excessive fe loaded on carbon surface 3 3 effect of salt concentration on desalination performance to simulate the accumulation of salt in the electrolyte the effect of various salt concentrations c b 0 41 10 1 g l 1 on the desalination performance of magnetic fcdi was evaluated as shown in fig s14 the salt removal performance of fcdi with and without magnetic field sharply increased as the initial salt concentration in the flow electrodes increased the results can be explained by the decrease of ionic resistance yang et al 2016 the results of nyquist plots fig s14 indicated the in situ equivalent series resistance esr i e the ionic resistance and interfacial resistance decreased from 16 9 to 4 1 ω with nacl concentration increased from 1 5 to 5 0 g l 1 fig 3 a shows that the asrrs calculated by eq 1 obtained at magnetic field are 2 04 2 78 times higher than those in the absence of a magnetic field although the effective capacitance significantly increased after providing a magnetic field fig s12 no difference was observed in the ionic resistance fig s15 furthermore the settling velocity sv of the flow electrodes and the turbidity of the supernatant were measured at a low nacl concentration c b 0 41 g l 1 the electrode particles were uniformly dispersed in the solution after 8 minutes of gravitational sedimentation fig 3b as the nacl concentration increased to 1 47 g l 1 the sv and turbidity obviously decreased to 45 and 840 ntu from 3200 ntu respectively with increasing nacl concentration the settling performance of the flow electrodes was further improved as evidenced by xps patterns fig 1g zeta potential fig 3c and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir fig s16 the surface of ac electrodes before and after fe loading contained a large number of oxygen functional groups i e oh and cooh thus the enhanced desalting efficiency at a high nacl concentration can also be attributed to the increase in collision frequency between carbon particles as electrostatic repulsion decreased here the effect of salt concentration can be explained by the classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory hermansson 1999 hoek and agarwal 2006 when the salt concentration is very low the repulsive force between electrode particles makes the flow electrodes stable suspension stability is indicative of low aggregation and a relatively monodisperse distribution of the electrode material hatzell et al 2015b when a magnetic field was applied fig 3d the electrostatic interaction between electrode particles was negligible compared with the magnetic force and the flow electrodes in the flow channel aggregated rapidly resulting in collision and aggregation behaviors that form interconnected particle networks for efficient charge transfer duduta et al 2011 wang et al 2020a once the aggregated electrodes were out of the magnetic field lower salt concentration was more conducive to the dispersion of the electrode particles as a result of electrostatic repulsion although an increase in salt concentration in the flow electrode is beneficial to salt removal energy efficiency and stability should also be considered in determining the optimal concentration or terminal concentration when the initial nacl concentration increased to 10 1 g l 1 obvious decreases in charge efficiency were observed with and without magnetic field and thereby caused a decrease in enrs fig s17 this result can be explained by the counterion back diffusion and co ion leakage from the electrode chamber to the spacer chamber moreno and hatzell 2018 porada et al 2014 with an increase in the salt concentration higher pumping energy and lower system stability are also expected to occur with the aggregation of carbon particles fig s18 thus it is recommended to replace the electrolyte in time when operating fcdi for a long time 3 4 effect of channel depth and carbon content narrow flow channels and high carbon content are conducive to the salt removal performance of fcdi but all of these strategies pose a risk of channel clogging hatzell et al 2015b rommerskirchen et al 2019 xu et al 2021c when the flow rate is constant a narrow flow channel allows for higher velocity generally the average velocity f can be calculated as follow f q f a cro q f w d where a cro is the cross sectional area of the flow channel w is the width of the channel and d is the depth of the channel here the calculated f values at d values of 2 4 and 6 mm are 10 0 7 5 and 5 0 m min 1 respectively figs 4 a and 4b show the variations of j and effluent conductivity of fcdi at different channel depths and carbon contents under switching magnetic field it was clearly observed that a lower d and or higher carbon content was favorable to the desalination performance of fcdi at a higher carbon content electron transport can be enhanced as more frequent collisions between ac particles wang et al 2020b in addition the ionic resistance of fcdi cell obviously decreased with the reduction in the distance for ion transport fig s19 furthermore continuous desalination tests were evaluated fig s20 and the calculated asrr was shown in fig 4c in the absence of a magnetic field the asrr increased by 75 4 115 8 as the carbon content increased from 5 to 10 wt irrespective of d and f in addition asrr increased by 100 3 and 69 5 for carbon contents of 5 and 10 wt respectively as d decreased from 6 to 2 mm these results are consistent with many previous studies hatzell et al 2015b ma et al 2018 xu et al 2021f yang et al 2019 when a magnetic field is applied the local carbon concentration near the current collector was expected much higher than that of the bulk flow electrode doornbusch et al 2016 as shown in fig 4c the asrr of fcdi with 5 wt carbon increased by 205 0 213 6 and 86 at d values of 6 4 and 2 mm respectively at d 2 mm high velocity f 10 m min 1 may cause fresh electrode particles to rush out of the flow channel quickly and not conducive to the formation of charge percolation network in comparison under a carbon content of 10 wt the enhancement in asrr caused by the magnetic field only reached 78 9 126 8 previous studies hatzell et al 2015a liang et al 2017 rommerskirchen et al 2019 have demonstrated the increase in the ionic and electronic conductivities as the carbon content increase due to the formation of conductive electrode networks as a result the nyquist plots showed a smaller slope at lower frequencies fig s19 however channel clogging is more likely to occur in a narrow flow channel and high carbon content fig 4 d indicated the viscosity of the flow electrodes increased as carbon content increase for instance at d 2 mm and carbon content 10 wt the j increased from 12 5 to 16 0 a m 2 after 30 min operation fig s20 therefore a carbon content of 10 wt and a d value of 4 mm were chosen as the optimal operating conditions for the magnetic fcdi system at such a condition the asrr was 1 6 times higher than at d 2 mm without magnetic field and reached 82 of the asrr at d 2 mm with a magnetic field 3 5 desalination mechanisms of magnetic fcdi in contrast to the normal condition in which the flow electrodes are evenly distributed in the electrode chambers the mac particles were concentrated near the current collector surface under the magnetic field fig 3d the aggregation of flow electrodes means that electrons can transport between the electrode particles more easily increasing the available adsorption capacity for ion storage the principle is similar to the equivalent film electrode efe model recently proposed by wang et al wang et al 2020b where the flow electrode stream can be approximated as a film electrode with a much larger macropore volume and significantly reduced electrical conductivity although the working capacitance of the dispersed flow electrodes is one or two orders of magnitude lower than that of static electrodes hand et al 2019 rommerskirchen et al 2019 shen et al 2020 magnetic field enables faster electrode collision and accelerates electron transport between the electrode particles when the agglomerated electrode particles left the magnetic field the disturbance of water flow and the repulsion between electrode particles made the flow electrode recover to the uniform state which enables continuous and stable desalination of fcdi in addition the introduction of magnetic field can also accelerate the charge compensation effect and improve the electrode regeneration efficiency the regeneration of the flow electrodes in the flow channel in sc mode was recently demonstrated to be beneficial to desalination efficiency junjun ma et al 2020 xu et al 2021b when the negatively charged flow electrodes i e na carbon enter the anode chamber the ions stored in the edls of electrode particles are released instantaneously in two ways fig 3d i co ions are expelled from the pores when the electrode particles contact the anode current collector and ii charge compensation occurs when electrode particles with opposite polarity come into contact and the stored ions both anions and cations leave the electrode surface by passive diffusion these processes were enhanced by the magnetic field enabling efficient electrode regeneration 3 6 evaluation of the fcdi system under magnetic field in long term operation to verify the desalination performance of the magnetic fcdi system in long term operation semi continuous operation for 2800 min 3 cycles was performed coupled with magnetic separation for electrode regeneration it has been demonstrated that magnetic separation is more efficient and convenient than sedimentation and membrane filtration processes for electrode regeneration and concentrated electrolyte discharge ma et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b 2019 fig 5 a shows the changes in j and effluent conductivity in 3 operation cycles j gradually increased as the charging time increased at the beginning of the deionization processes due to the increase in salt concentration in the electrolyte fig 5b a detailed explanation regarding the effect of salt concentration can be found in section 3 3 when the electrolyte conductivity was higher than 10 ms cm 1 various parameters such as j effluent conductivity and asrr gradually stabilized nevertheless a slight decrease in the desalination performance of fcdi was found when the conductivity of the electrolyte increased to 20 ms cm 1 the phenomenon was consistent with the abovementioned results that the charge efficiency decreased as salt concentration increased 10 g l 1 thus after 1000 min of operation the concentrated electrolyte was separated from the flow electrodes by magnetic separation compared to the efficiency under gravity separation the separation efficiency increased by approximately 150 with the assistance of a magnetic field leading to a decrease in the solid volume from 50 to 18 ml after 2 min fig 5c and video s3 after a total of 5 min of settling 70 80 of the electrolyte supernatant was replaced by the same volume of deionized water in brief the results demonstrated that magnetic fcdi has stable and efficient desalination performance in continuous operation that is fig s21 the ce enrs sec and tee values over 3 cycles are maintained at 101 6 8 77 μmol j 1 0 18 kwh m 3 and 9 7 respectively notably the magnetic fcdi system achieves a stable asrr of 0 70 μmol cm 2 min 1 which is 201 1 that of the desalination process in the absence of a magnetic field fig s22 3 7 performance comparisons of magnetic fcdi with previous works fig 4g shows a detailed comparison of magnetic fcdi with conventional fcdi systems for salt removal from brackish water doornbusch et al 2016 luo et al 2020 ma et al 2020 ma et al 2021 rommerskirchen et al 2015 xu et al 2021c yang et al 2019 to improve the comparability all data collected from previous studies were obtained under scc or sc modes under similar experimental conditions such as u 1 2 v carbon content 10 wt initial salt concentration 2000 mg l 1 concentration reduction 25 mm water productivity 100 l m 2 h 1 using a single chamber fcdi system table s2 the energy consumption was limited to 8 μmol j 1 at u 1 2 v for most studies generally obtained with short term tests it should be noted that the data from previous studies were mainly obtained in short term experiments and thus the results may be overcalculated in this study a stable enrs of 8 77 μmol j 1 and asrr 0 70 μmol cm 2 min 1 was obtained in a long term test 2800 min indicating the energy efficiency advantage of the magnetic fcdi compared with conventional systems compared with flow electrodes with ac alone flow electrodes containing various conductive additives such as cnts and cb mass fraction 1 2 5 wt are more favorable to electroadsorption luo et al 2020 ma et al 2020 tang et al 2019 xu et al 2021c although magnetic carbon has no advantage over these electrode materials in terms of electroconductivity it achieves a significant increase in asrr with the assistance of a magnetic field more importantly the coupling of magnetic field and magnetic carbon can not only improve desalination performance but also facilitate solid liquid separation thus killing two birds with one stone it is also expected that the desalination performance of magnetic fcdi can be further improved by improving the electroconductivity of the flow electrodes 4 conclusions the results of this study show that an assisted magnetic field enables a significant enhancement in the desalination performance of fcdi compared with conventional operation strategies under a magnetic field the dispersed electrode particles aggregated near the current collector surface and form a more concentrated electrode flow thereby realizing complete exploitation of the adsorption capacity of the flow electrodes benefiting from the formation of a continuous electron transport network a significant enhancement in asrr 78 9 205 was attained with the assistance from the magnetic field compared with that in the absence of a magnetic field in long term tests the stable desalination performance of magnetic fcdi was also demonstrated with a stable asrr of 0 70 μmol cm 2

16076,microalgal bacterial consortium mbc process has been proposed as an alternative to conventional activated sludge process for nitrogen removal from wastewater as one of the most influencing parameters light irradiation effects on microalgae have been extensively investigated however light influence on the performance of nitrifiers in activated sludge and its mechanism remains unclear in this study the effects of three factors light irradiation power irradiation time and sludge concentration on activities and physiological characteristics of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were systematically studied through both the design of experiments driven response surface methodology rsm approach and light nitrification kinetic modeling results indicated that light irradiation with the specific light energy density es at 0 0203 0 1571 kj mg 1 vss 80 160 w 400 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 2 0 5 0 h and 2750 4250 mg l 1 stimulated the relative aob activities raob by 120 0 this was supported by the increased electron transport system activity key enzyme activity amo gene expression amoa and energy generation atp consumption in the light treatment moreover further es increasing up to 0 18 kj mg 1 vss inhibited both aob and nob activities the inhibition was ascribed to the joint light responses of metabolic disorders and lipid peroxidation the findings enhance our understanding of nitrifiers physiological responses to short term light irradiation and promote the development of mbc as a sustainable approach for wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords light irradiation nitrifier ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitritation microalgal bacterial consortium mbc 1 introduction microalgal bacterial consortium mbc process has been intensively investigated as a potential alternative to conventional nitrification to minimize costly mechanical aeration via photo oxygenation akizuki et al 2020a and nutrient recovery into value added byproducts such as biofuel animal feed and bio fertilizers fuentes et al 2016 to date its commercial implementation has still been hindered by the relatively low process efficiencies and stabilities which are largely related to the symbiosis between bacteria e g nitrifiers and denitrifiers and microalgae as one of the most influencing parameters for mbc light irradiation is important for the maintenance of activities of functional microorganisms and nutrient removal performance light effects e g light photoperiod and density on microalgae have been extensively investigated in pure microalgae systems bohutskyi et al 2016 wu et al 2021 for example our recent study revealed that high irradiation density results in lower growth rates and photosynthetic activities of chlorella sp but with similar nutrient uptake efficiencies as the low density group chen et al 2021 comparatively nitrifiers have been constantly recognized to be light sensitive varying their nitrogen transformation pathways with external light environments the inhibitory effect of light irradiation on nitrifiers was firstly reported by schön and engel 1962 which was further evidenced by subsequent investigations involving the light source light intensity light cycle wavelength and nitrifiers strains guerrero 1997 guerrero and jones 1996 jia and yuan 2018 kang et al 2018 light irradiation was also demonstrated to play key roles in the nitrogen cycle in aquatic ecosystems through stimulating absorption and excretion of inorganic nitrogen akizuki et al 2020a lu et al 2020 in addition some controversies or conflicting conclusions were reported on the photo sensitivities of nitrifiers including ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob akizuki et al 2020b reported that aob exhibited a higher light sensitivity than nob in both dispersed and granular sludge systems while vergara et al 2016 documented that nob were more significantly affected by increasing light intensities alternatively our recent study found that light irradiation enriched the growth of the key aob family nitrosomonadaceae but eliminated nitrosomonas in sequencing batch reactors treating both synthetic and real municipal wastewater wang et al 2021 it was reported that the impact of light irradiation on nitrifiers relied on growth rate physiological stage sludge concentration of microorganisms kwon et al 2020 mcguigan et al 2012 therefore the above noted influencing factors should be comprehensively considered to explore the specific responses of aob and nob in nitrifiers to light irradiation in the activated sludge system moreover the inherent light induced mechanisms requires further investigations although attempts were conducted regarding the inactivation of key enzymes hyman and arp 1992 merbt et al 2012 and the destruction of cytochromes guerrero 1997 involved in the energy transduction pathway of nitrification the objective of this study was to systematically evaluate the responds of nitrifiers to short term light irradiation and unveil its inherent light responding possible mechanisms specifically the effects of three key operating parameters light irradiation energy light irradiation time and sludge concentration on the activities of aob and nob were systematically studied using the response surface methodology assay and modeling evaluation the respective photostimulation and photoinhibition were investigated from the aspects of the microbial electron transfer energy production enzyme activities expressions of related functional genes oxidative stress and extracellular polymeric substances eps production the findings will enhance the understanding of the mechanism of the light irradiation on nitrifiers and the obtained results will promote the development of the mbcp for sustainable wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 nitrifying sludge cultivated in a parent sbr sludge used in this study was collected from a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 10 l sbr was operated for 180 min each cycle consisting of 5 min filling 60 min anoxic reaction 90 min aeration 20 min settling and 5 min decanting complete nitrification and denitrification can be achieved in aerobic and anoxic stages sludge was not deliberately discharged except sludge loss via effluent and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss ranged at 2000 100 mg l 1 the sbr was operated in room temperature and natural light environment with the light intensity ranging between 2 and 5 μmol m 2 s 1 the air flow rate was controled via a gas flow controller to maintain the dissolved oxygen do level of 2 0 4 0 mg l 1 and ph was controled at 7 5 0 2 with 1 m naoh and 1 m hcl solutions prior to the following experiment sbr was operated for 6 months with complete nitrification and denitrification performance the family nitrosomonadaceae predominated the aob community 1 45 2 58 consisting of the genus of nitrosomonas and ellin6067 and while nitrospira 3 08 4 05 was found as the dominant nob synthetic municipal wastewater was fed to

investigated by studying the effects of three key operating parameters on aob and nob activities through the rsm using the box behnken experimental design bbd which is one of the most efficient approach from the point of view of the number of experiments the three testing factors included light irradiation power p w irradiation time t h and sludge concentration mlvss mg l 1 the specific ammonia oxidation rate saor mg n g 1 mlvss 1 h 1 and the specific nitrite oxidation rate snor mg g 1 mlvss 1 h 1 were evaluated as functions of three independent factors according to the experimental design through the rsm table 1 a relative activity of r raob or rnob was introduced to indicate the light responding changes of aob and nob activities namely the ratios of saor or snor obtained at the light irradiation condition to saorinitial or snorinitial at the control table 1 lists the values employed for three operational variables and the experimental design according to this design 17 experimental runs were conducted containing five replications at the central point to allow for estimation of the purely experimental uncertainty variance with 17 sets of experimental conditions and results the data fitting of the quadratic term was carried out and estimated as per eq 1 1 y α 0 i 1 k α i x i i 1 k α i i x i 2 1 i j k α i j x i x j ε where y is the dependent variables of raob and rnob calculated according to eq 1 xi and xj are independent factors with three standardized coded levels 1 0 1 including x1 light power x1 40 60 100 w or 200 600 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 x2 irradiation time

analyzed by the appropriate program of design expert 8 0 stat ease inc u s the experimental procedures were briefly described as follows the sludge taken from the parent sbr was washed three times with deionized water to fully remove the remaining substrates and then was light pretreated with various light irradiation conditions as noted in table 1 in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks the actual light conditions in flasks for all runs were detailed in table s1 subsequently at the end of irradiation saor and snor were determined with additions of ammonium 30 0 mg l 1 or nitrite 30 0 mg l 1 in the respective cultures each group performed in triplicate consisted of the light group and the control with exact similar operations to obtain the relative activity of raob or rnob all flasks were constantly mixed by magnetic stirrers to provide suspended status the ph was controled at 7 5 0 2 using 1 m naoh and 1 m hcl solutions the temperature was controled at 25 0 2 0 c using water bath in glass containers which reduced the light intensity by approximately 20 the led light board used here holding 80 similarity to solar light offered the above variable irradiation conditions using a controller kesheng laboratory instruments co ltd ningbo china 2 2 2 effects of light irradiation on physiological performance of nitrifiers based on the rsm results run 9 120 w 600 μmol m 2 s 1 3 5 h 3500 mg l 1 and run 16 200 w 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 6 0 h 3500 mg l 1 was selected to study the photostimulation only for aob and photoinhibition potential mechanisms for both aob and nob respectively specifically run 9 was conducted for one group with the addition of ammonium for the photostimulation condition which was assumed to represent the physiological performance of aob due to the dominant ammonium oxidation in the short nitrification time 10 min also with excessive residual nh4 n 25 0 mg l 1 comparatively run 16 was conducted for two groups with the additions of ammonium or nitrite for the photoinhibition conditions for both aob and nob similar experimental setup and procedures were adopted as above for all groups samples were collected at 10 min after additions of substrates to evaluate the variations of the microbial oxidative stress key enzyme activities and expressions of mrna electron transport system activity etsa nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh and adenosine triphosphate atp level eps were extracted and quantified for samples taken at the end of the experiment 2 3 modeling kinetic analysis for light irradiation effects on aob and nob activities based on our previous study wang et al 2021 an updated light nitrification model was developed to more comprehensively understand the influences of light shock on nitrifying bacteria the specific light energy density es kj mg 1 vss eq 2 was proposed to represent the light energy obtained per milligram of sludge biomass considering the synergistic effects of the light irradiation power p w and time t h sludge concentration mlvss mg l 1 and effective volume m3 of conical flask affected the light treatment of sludge in the eq 2 0 03 was the energy conversion rate of sludge to the total energy of the illumination board 3 6 was the conversion coefficient of the unit between kj and w h and v was the effective volume of the conical flask applied as the reactor 0 2 l 2 e s 0 03 3 6 p t v m l v s s the aob and nob activities were indicated by the saor and snor respectively which were calculated in the eq 3 according to the activated sludge models asm henze et al 2006 moreover the relationship between the maximum specific growth rate μmax and apparent activation energy eap was described by the arrhenius equation as shown in the eq 4 in the equations y and μmax are the yield coefficient g cod g 1 n and the maximum specific growth rate d 1 respectively s and ks represent the initial nitrogen concentration 30 mg l 1 and the substrate affinity constant mg n l 1 respectively so and kso represent the dissolved oxygen concentration 2 0 4 0 mg l 1 with the average of 3 0 mg l 1 and the oxygen saturation values mg o2 l 1 respectively x is the biomass concentration of nitrifying bacteria mg vss l 1 a is the model constant nondimensional t is the temperature 298 k and r is the thermodynamic constant 8 31 j mol 1 k 1 3 s a o r o r s n o r 1 y μ m a x s s k s s o s o k s o x 4 μ m a x a exp e a p r t therefore the relative activity r can be expressed as the ratio of the saor or snor at respective light conditions to that in the control in eq 5 where m is a parameter as expressed in eq 6 denoting the affinities variations of aob or nob to the nitrogenous substrate and oxygen the model results offer us the specific responses of the biomass growth b and energy barrier of biochemical reaction k in nitrification to light irradiance zheng et al 2016 the software package matlab r2019b was used for data analysis and nonlinear regression the modeling details could be found

digital illuminometer lichuangjiliang company china the test procedures for saor and snor were described in text s3 etsa was determined by reducing 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride int to orange formazan inf broberg 1985 details of the procedures are provided in the text s4 the enzymatic activities of ammonia monooxygenase amo hydroxylamine oxidoreductase enzyme hao and nitrite oxidoreductase nxr were measured as described elsewhere chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 text s5 rna extractions and rt qpcr analysis were described in text s6 the heat extraction method was used to extract eps from the sludge samples collected at the end of the experiments li and yang 2007 and the extracted eps were analyzed for the polysaccharides ps and proteins pn using the sulfate phenol method and the lowry method respectively text s7 in addition all oxidative stress parameters were determined using the respective assay kits according to the manufacturer s instructions including the reactive oxygen species ros lactate dehydrogenase ldh catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod atp and nadh beyotime biotechnology nanjing jiancheng institute of biological engineering shanghai jingkang china qiu et al 2022 finally the supernatant containing intracellular material was obtained similar to the enzyme activity test for spectral analysis the absorbance spectra were recorded using a molecular devices spextramax m3 at wavelengths from 200 nm to 650 nm and wavelength range for the scans was recorded and stored at 2 nm intervals 2 5 statistical analysis the results presented are average values standard error of mean from the independent triplicate experiments the differences in the aob nob activities transcriptions of gene as well as nh4 n no2 n concentrations and oxidation rates between among test groups were analyzed for significance using t test or one way anova with a post hoc tukey s test at a significant level of 0 05 3 results 3 1 rsm analysis 3 1 1 aob activities responding to short term light irradiation based on the rsm result the quadratic model was selected because it held p value 0 0001 the highest lack of fit p value 0 7137 the lowest standard deviation 3 10 highest r squared values 0 9902 and 0 9770 and a lowest press 362 30 tables s8 2 s8 3 and s8 4 fig 1 illustrates three dimensional response surfaces reflecting the synergistic effects of light irradiation on raob where the effects of two factors were studied as dependent variables while the third factor was held at its center level similar observations were obtained for all three factors that raob increased firstly and then decreased as any of three factors increased specifically raob increased rapidly with the increase of light power and began to decline when it reached the peak value of 164 5 at 120 w 600 μmol m 2 s 1 which the numerical value of raob was always greater than 100 0 fig 1a and c this indicated an obvious stimulatory effect was obtained for aob under the instant light irradiation stress with relatively lower powers 40 160 w 200 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 continuous increase of irradiation power induced the sharp decline of raob leading to the photoinhibition of aob within the range investigated 160 200 w 1000 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 comparatively both the irradiation time and sludge concentration had relatively more minor influences on aob raob varied by 79 0 fig 1a with the irradiation power and such variation for raob was only 64 2 and 23 1 caused by the irradiation time and sludge concentration fig 1a and e the perturbation analysis with raob responding to each individual factor fig 2 a presents visual evidence to support the above observation text s8 3 1 2 nob activities responding to short term light irradiation rnob was used to represent the response of nob s activities to short term light irradiation similarly anova analysis table s9 1 results indicated that the relationship between rnob and three factors could be described by the quadratic model with a p value of 0 0007 see details in text s9 as shown in fig 1 rnob was less than 100 0 in almost all conditions implying that nob was sensitive to be inhibited by the light shock moreover rnob presented negative correlations with light irradiation power and time specifically rnob decreased by 44 9 and 29 5 with the increase of irradiation power and time fig 1b and d while sludge concentration was positively correlated with nob and only varied 18 8 fig 1d therefore the influence of irradiation power on nob activities was the strongest which fitted in with f values 270 01 145 50 23 29 fig 2 b further shows the unidirectional variation of light irradiation on nob inhibition and the irradiation power had the greatest effect on nob in the short term light treatment see details in si s3 however the photoinhibition effect could be slightly alleviated when the sludge concentration increased moreover a slight stimulatory effect on nob 100 0 120 0 was obtained under the condition with the lowest irradiation power and the highest sludge concentration fig 1d this was likely due to the self shading effect of the high sludge concentration weakened transmitted light in system and reduced frequency and quantity of bacteria exposure to light kwon et al 2020 3 2 kinetic analysis of aob and nob to light energy density mathematic modeling was employed to comprehensively describe the effect of light shock on the activity of aob and nob as shown in eq 5 the mathematical relationship between the relative activity r and specific light energy density es was established by using nonlinear regression of the measured saor and snor values for aob and nob respectively fig 3 compares the experimental data and modeling data from rsm of raob and rnob varying with the es under nine selected representative conditions it also indicated that the activity of aob firstly increased and then decreased and a turning point occurred at the middle position of es while rnob showed a downward trend with the increase of es which was the same as the results of response surface analysis for instance fig 3i indicates the activity variation of aob and nob with es which changes with the irradiation power when the irradiation time 6 0 h and the sludge concentration 3500 mg l 1 were constant it was obvious that the rnob decreased from 100 0 with the increasing es implying the continuous nob inhibition with light treatment comparatively the raob showed the initial ascent before es of 0 09 kj mg 1 vss then declined as es increased further specifically up to 1 40 fold higher aob activities were observed for the optimum energy density conditions es 0 04 0 14 kj mg 1 vss including the irradiation power of 40 w 200 μmol m 2 s 1 and 120 w 600 μmol m 2 s 1 however when the power was elevated to 200 w 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 raob showed a continuous decrease as observed for rnob table 2 lists three model constants m substrate and oxygen affinities k energy barrier of nitrification reaction and b biomass growth which were obtained by minimizing the sum of squares of deviations between the measured and predicted r values obviously comparable m values around 100 were obtained for both aob and nob indicating that there was no significant influence of the light shock on the ks and kso of nitrifiers in the saor and snor tests the initial substrate concentrations 30 mg n l 1 were much higher than those of ks and kso leading to minor changes in m values moreover aob held higher estimated k values than nob for all nine studied light conditions suggesting that aob had a relatively lower apparent activation energy es due to the photostimulation effect therefore it was beneficial for the biochemical reaction of aob moreover the higher the k value the greater the absolute of b value indicating that in the absence of substrate whether stimulated or inhibited light conditions the greater the impact on nitrifiers the greater the damage to nitrifiers under higher specific energy densities both aob and nob were inhibited and this inhibition worked more on nob this was also evidenced by the raob were higher than rnob for all analyzed light conditions fig 3 and the more positive k values for aob table 2 these modeling constants clearly indicated that the instant light treatment with appropriate energy densities was beneficial to promote aob activity while inhibit nob and induce concurrent photoinhibition beyond certain light densities 3 3 effects of short term light irradiation on intra and extra cellular metabolisms of nitrifiers two light conditions were selected to investigate the physiological responses of aob and nob including the photostimulation group 120 w 600 μmol m 2 s 1 3 5 h 3500 mg l 1 and photoinhibition group 200 w 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 6 0 h 3500 mg l 1 fig 4 presents the variations of the relative etsa amo hao nxr atp and nadh for both aob and nob under two instantaneous light conditions compared to the controls 3 3 1 effects on electron transport energy generation and nadh production in nitrification amo hao and nxr mediate the oxidation of ammonia hydroxylamine and nitrite respectively during reactions of which electrons are transferred into the electron transport chain process for the synthesis of atp and nadh as shown in fig 4a the aob photostimulation group achieved 21 6 higher relative etsa values for aob over the control 4 16 0 04 vs 3 42 0 25 μg o2 g 1 protein min 1 comparatively in the photoinhibition group the relative etst values were 6 6 and 23 9 both p 0 05 t test lower for aob and nob respectively fig 4a and b similar variations were found in the activities of amo and nxr specifically amo enzyme activity increased by 57 4 0 9525 0 0532 vs 1 4989 0 0633 mg n min 1 g 1 protein in the aob photostimulation group which positively correlated with the up regulated amoa gene expression 17 4 in the photoinhibition group the enzyme activities of amo and nxr declined by 25 6 0 7084 0 0613 mg n min 1 g 1 protein and 40 5 0 06929 0 00750 vs 0 04123 0 00523 mg n min 1 g 1 protein respectively the expression level of amoa gene dropped considerably 11 2 these observations were consistent with the variations of raob and rnob obtained under similar light conditions compared to the control both light groups obtained decreased atp levels but with different decrease degrees for example a much lower reduction of the atp level was obtained for aob in the photoinhibition group 15 3 83 06 8 60 nmol g 1 protein than that in the aob photostimulation group 43 3 55 57 5 13 nmol g 1 protein fig 4a nob also showed a 58 2 decrease 159 75 3 40 vs 66 78 21 07 nmol g 1 protein in the photoinhibition group fig 4b moreover no significant differences were observed in both the hao activity and nadh content for aob in both light groups p 0 05 however nob had a 28 8 decrease of the nadh content compared with the control 52 06 0 48 vs 37 07 3 04 ng g 1 protein fig 4b 3 3 2 effects on intracellular oxidative stress and eps production for photoinhibition group the photoinhibition group was further investigated with responses of intra ros and extra cellular compounds eps to light inhibition obviously both relative ros values declined by 19 3 and 29 5 compared to the controls respectively fig 5 a and b both p 0 05 t test the activities of two antioxidant enzymes of sod and cat increased for aob by 20 1 11 00 0 51 vs 13 21 0 08 u mg 1 protein p 0 05 t test and 36 0 5 86 0 23 vs 7 97 0 12 u mg 1 protein p 0 05 t test fig 5a respectively similar increase of sod was observed for nob but cat decreased by 17 1 fig 5b the opposite trends of ros and sod might be due to the case that as a component of the electron transport chain the complex i activity was inhibited as supported by the decreased etsa further leading to the reduction of ros as complex i is the main site of ros production plaza davila et al 2015 notably obvious ldh release existed for nitrifiers with the respective release rates of 19 5 and 68 0 for aob and nob fig 5c this further confirmed the photoinhibition effects on aob and nob under these light energy conditions extracellular substances are generally secreted responding to stress environments such as light inhibition as shown in fig 5d the total eps for aob 32 7 and nob 27 0 increased compared to the control primarily consisting of tb eps with significantly higher contents than lb eps moreover the eps protein responded more dramatically to the light irradiation than the eps polysaccharide did for example the differences in the eps protein and eps polysaccharide for aob exposure to light were 21 25 mg g 1 vss and 2 12 mg g 1 vss respectively as well as 17 69 mg g 1 vss and 3 56 mg g 1 vss for nob 3 4 absorption spectrum influenced by short term light irradiation in addition to the above intracellular metabolism the absorption spectrums of the intracellular substances of nitrifiers were evaluated as a relatively direct indicator using the ultraviolet spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy in general sludge exhibited three absorption peaks including at 280 nm proteins and nucleic acids 408 nm cytochrome c and 603 nm cytochrome aa3 as well as a trough at 350 400 nm guerrero 1997 the high absorption at 408 nm was believed to be positively correlated with the degree of photoinhibition guerrero 1997 as shown in fig s1 compared to the aob photoinhibition group nob photoinhibition group had the larger absorption peak at 408 nm confirming the greater photosensitivity of nob than aob this was also supported by the slightly higher adsorption peak at 603 nm under the same light condition moreover a smaller trough at 350 400 nm was found for the light condition with stronger inhibition 4 discussion 4 1 appropriate transient light conditions might stimulate aob activities probably by driving electronic transport and energy utilization the light stimulated aob activity raob greater than 120 0 was obtained under the light shock with the es ranging between 0 0203 and 0 1571 kj mg 1 vss 80 160 w 400 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 2 0 5 0 h and 2750 4250 mg l 1 this was also supported by the mathematical model with raob greater than 100 0 in all nine fitting groups fig 3 and positive k values table 2 the highest aob activity was observed for the condition of 120 w 600 μmol m 2 s 1 3 5 h and 3500 mg l 1 which was 64 5 higher than that of the control table 1 these findings provide more convincing evidence to our previous observation that the rapid startup of partial nitrification was achieved by two different light irradiation strategies in sequencing batch reactor systems treating municipal wastewater wang et al 2021 this observation seems to challenge the current opinions widely accepted in literature which believed the aob generally presented photoinhibition discussed in section 4 2 or no significant difference at the studied light conditions with various intensities akizuki et al 2020b enref 20 enref 21 for example vergara et al 2016 reported that two different light conditions with intensities of 0 and 250 μmol m 2 s 1 obtained similar specific ammonia oxidation rates and aob activities similar observation was achieved in a granular sludge system where the aob activity was stable even at a high light intensity of 1600 μmol m 2 s 1 akizuki et al 2020b alternatively in the bacteria algal system aob were also not found to be inhibited with light treatment jia and yuan 2018 it should be noted however this contradiction might be related to the different duration of light treatment on nitrifiers 1 0 6 0 h for this study and 12 h 15 days for literature fig 6 a illustrates the proposed potential mechanism for light induced aob stimulation light irradiation improved series of multiple metabolic processes including but not limited to the electron transport rate enzymatic activities amo and energy utilization in the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite eventually stimulating the aob activities and enhancing nitrification performance in this study aob presented higher etsa 21 6 amo activity 57 4 lower atp level 43 3 and similar hao activity and nadh level after light treatment fig 4 in nitrification electrons are transferred along the electron transport chain from the reducing agent nitrogen compound to the acceptor o2 with a more positive redox potential during which energy is released and protons are moved out of the cell with generation of proton motive force pmf subsequently the pmf drives the proton returning to the cell the previously released energy is promoted to synthesize atp therefore the electrons flowing backwards on the electron transport chain from the more positive redox potential nitrogen compounds to the more negative redox potential nad nadh need to absorb energy and through pmf to move against the redox potential gradient the following considerations involved in the electron transfer process were made for the light induced aob stimulation firstly the appropriate short term light irradiation with the es levels between 0 0203 and 0 1571 kj mg 1 vss might offer aob additional energy for enhancement of both the amo activities and electron transport system specifically the high activity of amo possibly accelerated the entire electron transport rate producing sufficient electrons for the related enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase this could be evidenced by the stimulated amo up regulated amoa expression enhanced etsa as well as raob similarly the electron transfer system in aob was reported to be affected by the polystyrene addition due to the damage of amo finally reducing the ammonium oxidation efficiency yang et al 2020 the enhanced amo activity was also shown to significantly contribute to the aob activity and aerobic nitrification chen et al 2018 moreover hao was not significantly affected by light irradiation which was also supported by the similar nadh levels fig 4a hao and nadh presented synchronous responses to light irradiation due to the electrons used for the reduction of nad p to nad p h in aob only coming from the oxidation of hydroxylamine chain et al 2003 in other words the appropriate light irradiation primarily stimulated the amo activity and evaluated the oxidation rate of ammonium to hydroxylamine in the first step of nitrification rather than the second oxidation step of hydroxylamine to nitrite and hao activities secondly light treatment might drive electron transport along the electron transport chain to further favor the proton gradient thereby generating more intracellular atp and energy to cope with the enhancement of the metabolism however the atp levels observed in the light group decreased by 43 3 this inconsistence was believed to be that the light induced additionally generated atp was fast and excessively consumed for the concurrently light stimulated metabolism similar decreased intracellular atp levels were reported in literature which was attributed to the increase of central metabolic pathway flux thus promoting the synthesis of target metabolites such as pyruvate and glutamate aoki et al 2005 liu et al 2006 meanwhile the increase of atp adp was believed to be due to the relatively lower atp maintenance and rapid consumption this observation was also found in denitrifiers with the enhanced vitality in the presence of biochar zhang et al 2021 therefore certain transient light exposure might promote the aob metabolism through accelerating the rates of the atp synthesis and energy utilization 4 2 light shock with excessive energy densities inhibits both aob and nob potentially through metabolic disorders and lipid peroxidation both aob and nob were photoinactivated when es increasing up to 0 18 kj mg 1 vss with obviously decreased raob and rnob both by approximately 20 0 comparatively nob exhibited stronger light inhibitory responses under the same instant light conditions the rsm experimental results showed that raob values were higher than rnob in all 17 light groups table 1 for example the activities of aob and nob were inhibited by 13 8 and 32 5 respectively at es value of 0 1851 kj mg 1 vss 200 w 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 3 5 h 3500 mg l 1 such activity difference was maximized to 68 6 120 w 600 μmol m 2 s 1 3 5 h 3500 mg l 1 this observation could be also supported by the mathematical model results showing that the raob always held higher values among 9 fitted graphs fig 3 with greater k values table 2 the kinetic modeling could provide a powerful tool to screen optimal ranges of operational parameters resulting in relatively high k values for aob and low k and b values for nob these results were consistent with kwon et al 2020 reporting that nob were more sensitive towards light irradiation with more dramatically reduced snor 73 91 compared to saor 58 67 similar observations were demonstrated in algal bacterial systems kang et al 2018 vergara et al 2016 however the strains and species of nitrifiers seemed to determine light responses yoshioka and saijo 1984 guerrero and jones 1996 found that ammonia oxidizers nitrosomonas cryotolerans and nitrosococcus oceanus exhibited higher photosensitive than the nitrite oxidizers nitrococcus mobilis and nitrobacter sp more investigations are therefore required regarding the photosensitivities of aob and nob while a majority view insisted that nitrifiers are inhibited with exposure to high light irradiation the possible photoinhibition mechanism as illustrated in fig 6 b and c were ascribed to the joint light responses of metabolic disorders and lipid peroxidation on the one hand transient light irradiation with high es presumably offered overload energy for interactive negative effects on the electron transport system and the enzyme activities specifically the oxidation of cytochrome c high absorption at 408 nm fig s1 and cytochrome aa3 slight increase at 603 nm fig s1 indicated of the restriction of the electron transfer and utilization it was reported that the photoinhibition i e photo oxidation and photo bleaching of cytochrome c an important electron transport carrier in electron transport chain largely replied on the absorbance at 408 nm guerrero 1997 cytochrome aa3 which is a crucial component of complex iv had a higher absorption peak than the control resulting the cleavage of complex iv moreover the oxidation of the amo was observed as indicated by the troughs between 350 and 400 nm in the photoinhibition group fig s1 this was supported by previous studies reporting that light irradiation of resting cells with near ultraviolet uv light inactivated amo and led to obvious decreases in the absorption of 350 400 nm region shears and wood 1985 xu et al 2018 moreover the decrease of etsa and enzyme activity reduced the rate of energy production and atp synthesis led to the failure of multiple cellular functions this implied that nitrifiers might initiate self protection by decreasing metabolic activities e g oxidation of nitrogenous compounds to resist against light inhibition holm et al 2010 on the other hand the momentary high light irradiation with excessive photons and energy might induce membrane lipid peroxidation and even cellular cleavage and apoptosis the significantly increased release rates of ldh observed in the photoinhibition group indicated the injury of cell membrane integrity this was consistent with the enhanced activities of the antioxidation enzymes sod and cat fig 5a and b to scavenge reactive oxygen species ros and other reactive nitrogen species not evaluated in this study venditti et al 2013 similar membrane damage was demonstrated under the conditions of the 300 400 nm wavelength light kelland et al 1983 moreover the light shock with high energy densities might induce the damage of cellular substances the near uv radiation could cause cell membranes injury suppress growth and even kill escherichia coli cells berney et al 2006 and photochemical reactions were motivated for the generation of the dna photoproducts that were lethal to cells bosshard et al 2009 spuhler et al 2010 4 3 light shock with high energy densities promotes more eps excretion the instant light stress with high energy densities stimulates nitrifiers to secrete excessive eps which potentially enhance bacterial adhesion and mutual interactions and act as a three dimensional protection from light thereby improving their resistance to external light stress the eps composition played important roles in cell surface properties mainly by varying the cell surface hydrophobicity and surface charge tsuneda et al 2003 eps polysaccharides were known to be highly hydrophilic with a large number of hydrophilic groups yue et al 2015 and negative charges halder et al 2015 in this study the increased eps protein contents might be the main reason for the enhancement of the bacterial adhesion the higher protein contents possibly resulted in the increase of hydrophobicity and reduced surface charge facilitating bacterial adhesion this was consistent with our recent observation that light irradiation resulted in increased secretions of four kinds of functional eps proteins and their rearranged position contributing to the microalgal flocculation chen et al 2021 the primary reason for the increased eps might be the leakage of intracellular substances caused by the cell membrane damage microbial eps could be generated through multiple pathways such as the active secretion cell surface material shedding adsorption from surrounding environments and cell lysis wingender et al 1999 yu 2020 the intracellular substances were considered to be the most important eps sources in this study after transient high light irradiation the significantly increased ldh release rate indicated the cell membrane damage probably resulting in the transmembrane transport of intracellular substances for eps synthesis li et al 2021 also reported that more eps production was largely attributed to the leakage of intracellular materials through the increased membrane permeability under the co2 stress conditions 4 4 environmental significance this study investigated the metabolic physiological and dynamic responses of aob and nob to the external light shock and for the first time reported that the appropriate light irradiation considering three independent light factors light irradiation power and time sludge concentration had potential to stimulate aob activities further increasing light intensity would result in simultaneous inhibition on both aob and nob these observations enhance current understanding of light effects on nitrifers in activated sludge treating wastewater and meanwhile confirm the feasibility of establishment of nitritation denitritation in mbcp depending on the selective photostimulated aob performance wang et al 2021 compared to conventional nitrification denitrification the light induced nitritation denitritation in the mbcp system has the potential to further reduce the aeration and carbon demands due to the shortened nitrogen transformation pathways as well as produce less sludge besides light irradiation conditions could be optimized to benefit the synergies between microalgae and nitrifiers because the self shielding effects due to the gradual increase of microalgae could provide photoprotection for nitrifiers jia and yuan 2018 kwon et al 2020 moreover although a specific light energy density of es was proposed considering both the light and microbial conditions the findings were obtained using the special mixed sludge cultures with certain aob and nob abundance limiting the results applicability to some extents further investigation with additional sludge sources and enriched or pure aob nob cultures are therefore required to confirm their physiological and molecular light responding characteristics and mechanisms facilitating the development of the mbcp as a sustainable approach for wastewater treatment 5 conclusion the short term effects of three factors light irradiation power irradiation time and sludge concentration on aob and nob were investigated the integrated potential mechanisms for the selective photostimulation and photoinhibition were also proposed our findings suggested that the influence of light irradiation power on nitrifying bacteria was the greatest followed by light irradiation time and sludge concentration moreover the appropriate instant light irradiation with es at 0 0203 0 1571 kj mg 1 vss stimulated aob activities by probably driving electronic transport and energy utilization while es over 0 18 kj mg 1 vss inhibited both aob and nob possibly through the overproduction of oxidative stress and cell

16076,microalgal bacterial consortium mbc process has been proposed as an alternative to conventional activated sludge process for nitrogen removal from wastewater as one of the most influencing parameters light irradiation effects on microalgae have been extensively investigated however light influence on the performance of nitrifiers in activated sludge and its mechanism remains unclear in this study the effects of three factors light irradiation power irradiation time and sludge concentration on activities and physiological characteristics of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were systematically studied through both the design of experiments driven response surface methodology rsm approach and light nitrification kinetic modeling results indicated that light irradiation with the specific light energy density es at 0 0203 0 1571 kj mg 1 vss 80 160 w 400 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 2 0 5 0 h and 2750 4250 mg l 1 stimulated the relative aob activities raob by 120 0 this was supported by the increased electron transport system activity key enzyme activity amo gene expression amoa and energy generation atp consumption in the light treatment moreover further es increasing up to 0 18 kj mg 1 vss inhibited both aob and nob activities the inhibition was ascribed to the joint light responses of metabolic disorders and lipid peroxidation the findings enhance our understanding of nitrifiers physiological responses to short term light irradiation and promote the development of mbc as a sustainable approach for wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords light irradiation nitrifier ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitritation microalgal bacterial consortium mbc 1 introduction microalgal bacterial consortium mbc process has been intensively investigated as a potential alternative to conventional nitrification to minimize costly mechanical aeration via photo oxygenation akizuki et al 2020a and nutrient recovery into value added byproducts such as biofuel animal feed and bio fertilizers fuentes et al 2016 to date its commercial implementation has still been hindered by the relatively low process efficiencies and stabilities which are largely related to the symbiosis between bacteria e g nitrifiers and denitrifiers and microalgae as one of the most influencing parameters for mbc light irradiation is important for the maintenance of activities of functional microorganisms and nutrient removal performance light effects e g light photoperiod and density on microalgae have been extensively investigated in pure microalgae systems bohutskyi et al 2016 wu et al 2021 for example our recent study revealed that high irradiation density results in lower growth rates and photosynthetic activities of chlorella sp but with similar nutrient uptake efficiencies as the low density group chen et al 2021 comparatively nitrifiers have been constantly recognized to be light sensitive varying their nitrogen transformation pathways with external light environments the inhibitory effect of light irradiation on nitrifiers was firstly reported by schön and engel 1962 which was further evidenced by subsequent investigations involving the light source light intensity light cycle wavelength and nitrifiers strains guerrero 1997 guerrero and jones 1996 jia and yuan 2018 kang et al 2018 light irradiation was also demonstrated to play key roles in the nitrogen cycle in aquatic ecosystems through stimulating absorption and excretion of inorganic nitrogen akizuki et al 2020a lu et al 2020 in addition some controversies or conflicting conclusions were reported on the photo sensitivities of nitrifiers including ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob akizuki et al 2020b reported that aob exhibited a higher light sensitivity than nob in both dispersed and granular sludge systems while vergara et al 2016 documented that nob were more significantly affected by increasing light intensities alternatively our recent study found that light irradiation enriched the growth of the key aob family nitrosomonadaceae but eliminated nitrosomonas in sequencing batch reactors treating both synthetic and real municipal wastewater wang et al 2021 it was reported that the impact of light irradiation on nitrifiers relied on growth rate physiological stage sludge concentration of microorganisms kwon et al 2020 mcguigan et al 2012 therefore the above noted influencing factors should be comprehensively considered to explore the specific responses of aob and nob in nitrifiers to light irradiation in the activated sludge system moreover the inherent light induced mechanisms requires further investigations although attempts were conducted regarding the inactivation of key enzymes hyman and arp 1992 merbt et al 2012 and the destruction of cytochromes guerrero 1997 involved in the energy transduction pathway of nitrification the objective of this study was to systematically evaluate the responds of nitrifiers to short term light irradiation and unveil its inherent light responding possible mechanisms specifically the effects of three key operating parameters light irradiation energy light irradiation time and sludge concentration on the activities of aob and nob were systematically studied using the response surface methodology assay and modeling evaluation the respective photostimulation and photoinhibition were investigated from the aspects of the microbial electron transfer energy production enzyme activities expressions of related functional genes oxidative stress and extracellular polymeric substances eps production the findings will enhance the understanding of the mechanism of the light irradiation on nitrifiers and the obtained results will promote the development of the mbcp for sustainable wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 nitrifying sludge cultivated in a parent sbr sludge used in this study was collected from a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 10 l sbr was operated for 180 min each cycle consisting of 5 min filling 60 min anoxic reaction 90 min aeration 20 min settling and 5 min decanting complete nitrification and denitrification can be achieved in aerobic and anoxic stages sludge was not deliberately discharged except sludge loss via effluent and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss ranged at 2000 100 mg l 1 the sbr was operated in room temperature and natural light environment with the light intensity ranging between 2 and 5 μmol m 2 s 1 the air flow rate was controled via a gas flow controller to maintain the dissolved oxygen do level of 2 0 4 0 mg l 1 and ph was controled at 7 5 0 2 with 1 m naoh and 1 m hcl solutions prior to the following experiment sbr was operated for 6 months with complete nitrification and denitrification performance the family nitrosomonadaceae

6h2o 2 2 experimental setup effects of light irradiation on nitrifiers 2 2 1 effects of light irradiation on nitrifying activities the responses of nitrifiers to short term light irradiation were investigated by studying the effects of three key operating parameters on aob and nob activities through the rsm using the box behnken experimental design bbd which is one of the most efficient approach from the point of view of the number of experiments the three testing factors included light irradiation power p w irradiation time t h and sludge concentration mlvss mg l 1 the specific ammonia oxidation rate saor mg n g 1 mlvss 1 h 1 and the specific nitrite oxidation rate snor mg g 1 mlvss 1 h 1 were evaluated as functions of three independent factors according to the experimental design through the rsm table 1 a relative activity of r raob or rnob was introduced to indicate the light responding changes of aob and nob activities namely the ratios of saor or snor obtained at the light irradiation condition to saorinitial or snorinitial at the control table 1 lists the values employed for three operational variables and the experimental design according to this design 17 experimental runs were conducted containing five replications at the central point to allow for estimation of the purely experimental uncertainty variance with 17 sets of experimental conditions and results the data fitting of the quadratic term was carried out and estimated as per eq 1 1 y α 0 i 1 k α i x i i 1 k α i i x i 2 1 i j k α i j x i x j ε where y is the dependent variables of raob and rnob calculated according to eq 1 xi and xj are independent factors with three standardized coded levels 1 0 1 including x1 light power x1 40 60 100 w or 200 600 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 x2 irradiation time

analyzed by the appropriate program of design expert 8 0 stat ease inc u s the experimental procedures were briefly described as follows the sludge taken from the parent sbr was washed three times with deionized water to fully remove the remaining substrates and then was light pretreated with various light irradiation conditions as noted in table 1 in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks the actual light conditions in flasks for all runs were detailed in table s1 subsequently at the end of irradiation saor and snor were determined with additions of ammonium 30 0 mg l 1 or nitrite 30 0 mg l 1 in the respective cultures each group performed in triplicate consisted of the light group and the control with exact similar operations to obtain the relative activity of raob or rnob all flasks were constantly mixed by magnetic stirrers to provide suspended status the ph was controled at 7 5 0 2 using 1 m naoh and 1 m hcl solutions the temperature was controled at 25 0 2 0 c using water bath in glass containers which reduced the light intensity by approximately 20 the led light board used here holding 80 similarity to solar light offered the above variable irradiation conditions using a controller kesheng laboratory instruments co ltd ningbo china 2 2 2 effects of light irradiation on physiological performance of nitrifiers based on the rsm results run 9 120 w 600 μmol m 2 s 1 3 5 h 3500 mg l 1 and run 16 200 w 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 6 0 h 3500 mg l 1 was selected to study the photostimulation only for aob and photoinhibition potential mechanisms for both aob and nob respectively specifically run 9 was conducted for one group with the addition of ammonium for the photostimulation condition which was assumed to represent the physiological performance of aob due to the dominant ammonium oxidation in the short nitrification time 10 min also with excessive residual nh4 n 25 0 mg l 1 comparatively run 16 was conducted for two groups with the additions of ammonium or nitrite for the photoinhibition conditions for both aob and nob similar experimental setup and procedures were adopted as above for all groups samples were collected at 10 min after additions of substrates to evaluate the variations of the microbial oxidative stress key enzyme activities and expressions of mrna electron transport system activity etsa nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh and adenosine triphosphate atp level eps were extracted and quantified for samples taken at the end of the experiment 2 3 modeling kinetic analysis for light irradiation effects on aob and nob activities based on our previous study wang et al 2021 an updated light nitrification model was developed to more comprehensively understand the influences of light shock on nitrifying bacteria the specific light energy density es kj mg 1 vss eq 2 was proposed to represent the light energy obtained per milligram of sludge biomass considering the synergistic effects of the light irradiation power p w and time t h sludge concentration mlvss mg l 1 and effective volume m3 of conical flask affected the light treatment of sludge in the eq 2 0 03 was the energy conversion rate of sludge to the total energy of the illumination board 3 6 was the conversion coefficient of the unit between kj and w h and v was the effective volume of the conical flask applied as the reactor 0 2 l 2 e s 0 03 3 6 p t v m l v s s the aob and nob activities were indicated by the saor and snor respectively which were calculated in the eq 3 according to the activated sludge models asm henze et al 2006 moreover the relationship between the maximum specific growth rate μmax and apparent activation energy eap was described by the arrhenius equation as shown in the eq 4 in the equations y and μmax are the yield coefficient g cod g 1 n and the maximum specific growth rate d 1 respectively s and ks represent the initial nitrogen concentration 30 mg l 1 and the substrate affinity constant mg n l 1 respectively so and kso represent the dissolved oxygen concentration 2 0 4 0 mg l 1 with the average of 3 0 mg l 1 and the oxygen saturation values mg o2 l 1 respectively x is the biomass concentration of nitrifying bacteria mg vss l 1 a is the model constant nondimensional t is the temperature 298 k and r is the thermodynamic constant 8 31 j mol 1 k 1 3 s a o r o r s n o r 1 y μ m a x s s k s s o s o k s o x 4 μ m a x a exp e a p r t therefore the relative activity r can be expressed as the ratio of the saor or snor at respective light conditions to that in the control in eq 5 where m is a parameter as expressed in eq 6 denoting the affinities variations of aob or nob to the nitrogenous substrate and oxygen the model results offer us the specific responses of the biomass growth b and energy barrier of biochemical reaction k in nitrification to light irradiance zheng et al 2016 the software package matlab r2019b was used for data analysis and nonlinear regression the modeling details could be found

chloride int to orange formazan inf broberg 1985 details of the procedures are provided in the text s4 the enzymatic activities of ammonia monooxygenase amo hydroxylamine oxidoreductase enzyme hao and nitrite oxidoreductase nxr were measured as described elsewhere chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 text s5 rna extractions and rt qpcr analysis were described in text s6 the heat extraction method was used to extract eps from the sludge samples collected at the end of the experiments li and yang 2007 and the extracted eps were analyzed for the polysaccharides ps and proteins pn using the sulfate phenol method and the lowry method respectively text s7 in addition all oxidative stress parameters were determined using the respective assay kits according to the manufacturer s instructions including the reactive oxygen species ros lactate dehydrogenase ldh catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod atp and nadh beyotime biotechnology nanjing jiancheng institute of biological engineering shanghai jingkang china qiu et al 2022 finally the supernatant containing intracellular material was obtained similar to the enzyme activity test for spectral analysis the absorbance spectra were recorded using a molecular devices spextramax m3 at wavelengths from 200 nm to 650 nm and wavelength range for the scans was recorded and stored at 2 nm intervals 2 5 statistical analysis the results presented are average values standard error of mean from the independent triplicate experiments the differences in the aob nob activities transcriptions of gene as well as nh4 n no2 n concentrations and oxidation rates between among test groups were analyzed for significance using t test or one way anova with a post hoc tukey s test at a significant level of 0 05 3 results 3 1 rsm analysis 3 1 1 aob activities responding to short term light irradiation based on the rsm result the quadratic model was selected because it held p value 0 0001 the highest lack of fit p value 0 7137 the lowest standard deviation 3 10 highest r squared values 0 9902 and 0 9770 and a lowest press 362 30 tables s8 2 s8 3 and s8 4 fig 1 illustrates three dimensional response surfaces reflecting the synergistic effects of light irradiation on raob where the effects of two factors were studied as dependent variables while the third factor was held at its center level similar observations were obtained for all three factors that raob increased firstly and then decreased as any of three factors increased specifically raob increased rapidly with the increase of light power and began to decline when it reached the peak value of 164 5 at 120 w 600 μmol m 2 s 1 which the numerical value of raob was always greater than 100 0 fig 1a and c this indicated an obvious stimulatory effect was obtained for aob under the instant light irradiation stress with relatively lower powers 40 160 w 200 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 continuous increase of irradiation power induced the sharp decline of raob leading to the photoinhibition of aob within the range investigated 160 200 w 1000 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 comparatively both the irradiation time and sludge concentration had relatively more minor influences on aob raob varied by 79 0 fig 1a with the irradiation power and such variation for raob was only 64 2 and 23 1 caused by the irradiation time and sludge concentration fig 1a and e the perturbation analysis with raob responding to each individual factor fig 2 a presents visual evidence to support the above observation text s8 3 1 2 nob activities responding to short term light irradiation rnob was used to represent the response of nob s activities to short term light irradiation similarly anova analysis table s9 1 results indicated that the relationship between rnob and three factors could be described by the quadratic model with a p value of 0 0007 see details in text s9 as shown in fig 1 rnob was less than 100 0 in almost all conditions implying that nob was sensitive to be inhibited by the light shock moreover rnob presented negative correlations with light irradiation power and time specifically rnob decreased by 44 9 and 29 5 with the increase of irradiation power and time fig 1b and d while sludge concentration was positively correlated with nob and only varied 18 8 fig 1d therefore the influence of irradiation power on nob activities was the strongest which fitted in with f values 270 01 145 50 23 29 fig 2 b further shows the unidirectional variation of light irradiation on nob inhibition and the irradiation power had the greatest effect on nob in the short term light treatment see details in si s3 however the photoinhibition effect could be slightly alleviated when the sludge concentration increased moreover a slight stimulatory effect on nob 100 0 120 0 was obtained under the condition with the lowest irradiation power and the highest sludge concentration fig 1d this was likely due to the self shading effect of the high sludge concentration weakened transmitted light in system and reduced frequency and quantity of bacteria exposure to light kwon et al 2020 3 2 kinetic analysis of aob and nob to light energy density mathematic modeling was employed to comprehensively describe the effect of light shock on the activity of aob and nob as shown in eq 5 the mathematical relationship between the relative activity r and specific light energy density es was established by using nonlinear regression of the measured saor and snor values for aob and nob respectively fig 3 compares the experimental data and modeling data from rsm of raob and rnob varying with the es under nine selected representative conditions it also indicated that the activity of aob firstly increased and then decreased and a turning point occurred at the middle position of es while rnob showed a downward trend with the increase of es which was the same as the results of response surface analysis for instance fig 3i indicates the activity variation of aob and nob with es which changes with the irradiation power when the irradiation time 6 0 h and the sludge concentration 3500 mg l 1 were constant it was obvious that the rnob decreased from 100 0 with the increasing es implying the continuous nob inhibition with light treatment comparatively the raob showed the initial ascent before es of 0 09 kj mg 1 vss then declined as es increased further specifically up to 1 40 fold higher aob activities were observed for the optimum energy density conditions es 0 04 0 14 kj mg 1 vss including the irradiation power of 40 w 200 μmol m 2 s 1 and 120 w 600 μmol m 2 s 1 however when the power was elevated to 200 w 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 raob showed a continuous decrease as observed for rnob table 2 lists three model constants m substrate and oxygen affinities k energy barrier of nitrification reaction and b biomass growth which were obtained by minimizing the sum of squares of deviations between the measured and predicted r values obviously comparable m values around 100 were obtained for both aob and nob indicating that there was no significant influence of the light shock on the ks and kso of nitrifiers in the saor and snor tests the initial substrate concentrations 30 mg n l 1 were much higher than those of ks and kso leading to minor changes in m values moreover aob held higher estimated k values than nob for all nine studied light conditions suggesting that aob had a relatively lower apparent activation energy es due to the photostimulation effect therefore it was beneficial for the biochemical reaction of aob moreover the higher the k value the greater the absolute of b value indicating that in the absence of substrate whether stimulated or inhibited light conditions the greater the impact on nitrifiers the greater the damage to nitrifiers under higher specific energy densities both aob and nob were inhibited and this inhibition worked more on nob this was also evidenced by the raob were higher than rnob for all analyzed light conditions fig 3 and the more positive k values for aob table 2 these modeling constants clearly indicated that the instant light treatment with appropriate energy densities was beneficial to promote aob activity while inhibit nob and induce concurrent photoinhibition beyond certain light densities 3 3 effects of short term light irradiation on intra and extra cellular metabolisms of nitrifiers two light conditions were selected to investigate the physiological responses of aob and nob including the photostimulation group 120 w 600 μmol m 2 s 1 3 5 h 3500 mg l 1 and photoinhibition group 200 w 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 6 0 h 3500 mg l 1 fig 4 presents the variations of the relative etsa amo hao nxr atp and nadh for both aob and nob under two instantaneous light conditions compared to the controls 3 3 1 effects on electron transport energy generation and nadh production in nitrification amo hao and nxr mediate the oxidation of ammonia hydroxylamine and nitrite respectively during reactions of which electrons are transferred into the electron transport chain process for the synthesis of atp and nadh as shown in fig 4a the aob photostimulation group achieved 21 6 higher relative etsa values for aob over the control 4 16 0 04 vs 3 42 0 25 μg o2 g 1 protein min 1 comparatively in the photoinhibition group the relative etst values were 6 6 and 23 9 both p 0 05 t test lower for aob and nob respectively fig 4a and b similar variations were found in the activities of amo and nxr specifically amo enzyme activity increased by 57 4 0 9525 0 0532 vs 1 4989 0 0633 mg n min 1 g 1 protein in the aob photostimulation group which positively correlated with the up regulated amoa gene expression 17 4 in the photoinhibition group the enzyme activities of amo and nxr declined by 25 6 0 7084 0 0613 mg n min 1 g 1 protein and 40 5 0 06929 0 00750 vs 0 04123 0 00523 mg n min 1 g 1 protein respectively the expression level of amoa gene dropped considerably 11 2 these observations were consistent with the variations of raob and rnob obtained under similar light conditions compared to the control both light groups obtained decreased atp levels but with different decrease degrees for example a much lower reduction of the atp level was obtained for aob in the photoinhibition group 15 3 83 06 8 60 nmol g 1 protein than that in the aob photostimulation group 43 3 55 57 5 13 nmol g 1 protein fig 4a nob also showed a 58 2 decrease 159 75 3 40 vs 66 78 21 07 nmol g 1 protein in the photoinhibition group fig 4b moreover no significant differences were observed in both the hao activity and nadh content for aob in both light groups p 0 05 however nob had a 28 8 decrease of the nadh content compared with the control 52 06 0 48 vs 37 07 3 04 ng g 1 protein fig 4b 3 3 2 effects on intracellular oxidative stress and eps production for photoinhibition group the photoinhibition group was further investigated with responses of intra ros and extra cellular compounds eps to light inhibition obviously both relative ros values declined by 19 3 and 29 5 compared to the controls respectively fig 5 a and b both p 0 05 t test the activities of two antioxidant enzymes of sod and cat increased for aob by 20 1 11 00 0 51 vs 13 21 0 08 u mg 1 protein p 0 05 t test and 36 0 5 86 0 23 vs 7 97 0 12 u mg 1 protein p 0 05 t test fig 5a respectively similar increase of sod was observed for nob but cat decreased by 17 1 fig 5b the opposite trends of ros and sod might be due to the case that as a component of the electron transport chain the complex i activity was inhibited as supported by the decreased etsa further leading to the reduction of ros as complex i is the main site of ros production plaza davila et al 2015 notably obvious ldh release existed for nitrifiers with the respective release rates of 19 5 and 68 0 for aob and nob fig 5c this further confirmed the photoinhibition effects on aob and nob under these light energy conditions extracellular substances are generally secreted responding to stress environments such as light inhibition as shown in fig 5d the total eps for aob 32 7 and nob 27 0 increased compared to the control primarily consisting of tb eps with significantly higher contents than lb eps moreover the eps protein responded more dramatically to the light irradiation than the eps polysaccharide did for example the differences in the eps protein and eps polysaccharide for aob exposure to light were 21 25 mg g 1 vss and 2 12 mg g 1 vss respectively as well as 17 69 mg g 1 vss and 3 56 mg g 1 vss for nob 3 4 absorption spectrum influenced by short term light irradiation in addition to the above intracellular metabolism the absorption spectrums of the intracellular substances of nitrifiers were evaluated as a relatively direct indicator using the ultraviolet spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy in general sludge exhibited three absorption peaks including at 280 nm proteins and nucleic acids 408 nm cytochrome c and 603 nm cytochrome aa3 as well as a trough at 350 400 nm guerrero 1997 the high absorption at 408 nm was believed to be positively correlated with the degree of photoinhibition guerrero 1997 as shown in fig s1 compared to the aob photoinhibition group nob photoinhibition group had the larger absorption peak at 408 nm confirming the greater photosensitivity of nob than aob this was also supported by the slightly higher adsorption peak at 603 nm under the same light condition moreover a smaller trough at 350 400 nm was found for the light condition with stronger inhibition 4 discussion 4 1 appropriate transient light conditions might stimulate aob activities probably by driving electronic transport and energy utilization the light stimulated aob activity raob greater than 120 0 was obtained under the light shock with the es ranging between 0 0203 and 0 1571 kj mg 1 vss 80 160 w 400 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 2 0 5 0 h and 2750 4250 mg l 1 this was also supported by the mathematical model with raob greater than 100 0 in all nine fitting groups fig 3 and positive k values table 2 the highest aob activity was observed for the condition of 120 w 600 μmol m 2 s 1 3 5 h and 3500 mg l 1 which was 64 5 higher than that of the control table 1 these findings provide more convincing evidence to our previous observation that the rapid startup of partial nitrification was achieved by two different light irradiation strategies in sequencing batch reactor systems treating municipal wastewater wang et al 2021 this observation seems to challenge the current opinions widely accepted in literature which believed the aob generally presented photoinhibition discussed in section 4 2 or no significant difference at the studied light conditions with various intensities akizuki et al 2020b enref 20 enref 21 for example vergara et al 2016 reported that two different light conditions with intensities of 0 and 250 μmol m 2 s 1 obtained similar specific ammonia oxidation rates and aob activities similar observation was achieved in a granular sludge system where the aob activity was stable even at a high light intensity of 1600 μmol m 2 s 1 akizuki et al 2020b alternatively in the bacteria algal system aob were also not found to be inhibited with light treatment jia and yuan 2018 it should be noted however this contradiction might be related to the different duration of light treatment on nitrifiers 1 0 6 0 h for this study and 12 h 15 days for literature fig 6 a illustrates the proposed potential mechanism for light induced aob stimulation light irradiation improved series of multiple metabolic processes including but not limited to the electron transport rate enzymatic activities amo and energy utilization in the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite eventually stimulating the aob activities and enhancing nitrification performance in this study aob presented higher etsa 21 6 amo activity 57 4 lower atp level 43 3 and similar hao activity and nadh level after light treatment fig 4 in nitrification electrons are transferred along the electron transport chain from the reducing agent nitrogen compound to the acceptor o2 with a more positive redox potential during which energy is released and protons are moved out of the cell with generation of proton motive force pmf subsequently the pmf drives the proton returning to the cell the previously released energy is promoted to synthesize atp therefore the electrons flowing backwards on the electron transport chain from the more positive redox potential nitrogen compounds to the more negative redox potential nad nadh need to absorb energy and through pmf to move against the redox potential gradient the following considerations involved in the electron transfer process were made for the light induced aob stimulation firstly the appropriate short term light irradiation with the es levels between 0 0203 and 0 1571 kj mg 1 vss might offer aob additional energy for enhancement of both the amo activities and electron transport system specifically the high activity of amo possibly accelerated the entire electron transport rate producing sufficient electrons for the related enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase this could be evidenced by the stimulated amo up regulated amoa expression enhanced etsa as well as raob similarly the electron transfer system in aob was reported to be affected by the polystyrene addition due to the damage of amo finally reducing the ammonium oxidation efficiency yang et al 2020 the enhanced amo activity was also shown to significantly contribute to the aob activity and aerobic nitrification chen et al 2018 moreover hao was not significantly affected by light irradiation which was also supported by the similar nadh levels fig 4a hao and nadh presented synchronous responses to light irradiation due to the electrons used for the reduction of nad p to nad p h in aob only coming from the oxidation of hydroxylamine chain et al 2003 in other words the appropriate light irradiation primarily stimulated the amo activity and evaluated the oxidation rate of ammonium to hydroxylamine in the first step of nitrification rather than the second oxidation step of hydroxylamine to nitrite and hao activities secondly light treatment might drive electron transport along the electron transport chain to further favor the proton gradient thereby generating more intracellular atp and energy to cope with the enhancement of the metabolism however the atp levels observed in the light group decreased by 43 3 this inconsistence was believed to be that the light induced additionally generated atp was fast and excessively consumed for the concurrently light stimulated metabolism similar decreased intracellular atp levels were reported in literature which was attributed to the increase of central metabolic pathway flux thus promoting the synthesis of target metabolites such as pyruvate and glutamate aoki et al 2005 liu et al 2006 meanwhile the increase of atp adp was believed to be due to the relatively lower atp maintenance and rapid consumption this observation was also found in denitrifiers with the enhanced vitality in the presence of biochar zhang et al 2021 therefore certain transient light exposure might promote the aob metabolism through accelerating the rates of the atp synthesis and energy utilization 4 2 light shock with excessive energy densities inhibits both aob and nob potentially through metabolic disorders and lipid peroxidation both aob and nob were photoinactivated when es increasing up to 0 18 kj mg 1 vss with obviously decreased raob and rnob both by approximately 20 0 comparatively nob exhibited stronger light inhibitory responses under the same instant light conditions the rsm experimental results showed that raob values were higher than rnob in all 17 light groups table 1 for example the activities of aob and nob were inhibited by 13 8 and 32 5 respectively at es value of 0 1851 kj mg 1 vss 200 w 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 3 5 h 3500 mg l 1 such activity difference was maximized to 68 6 120 w 600 μmol m 2 s 1 3 5 h 3500 mg l 1 this observation could be also supported by the mathematical model results showing that the raob always held higher values among 9 fitted graphs fig 3 with greater k values table 2 the kinetic modeling could provide a powerful tool to screen optimal ranges of operational parameters resulting in relatively high k values for aob and low k and b values for nob these results were consistent with kwon et al 2020 reporting that nob were more sensitive towards light irradiation with more dramatically reduced snor 73 91 compared to saor 58 67 similar observations were demonstrated in algal bacterial systems kang et al 2018 vergara et al 2016 however the strains and species of nitrifiers seemed to determine light responses yoshioka and saijo 1984 guerrero and jones 1996 found that ammonia oxidizers nitrosomonas cryotolerans and nitrosococcus oceanus exhibited higher photosensitive than the nitrite oxidizers nitrococcus mobilis and nitrobacter sp more investigations are therefore required regarding the photosensitivities of aob and nob while a majority view insisted that nitrifiers are inhibited with exposure to high light irradiation the possible photoinhibition mechanism as illustrated in fig 6 b and c were ascribed to the joint light responses of metabolic disorders and lipid peroxidation on the one hand transient light irradiation with high es presumably offered overload energy for interactive negative effects on the electron transport system and the enzyme activities specifically the oxidation of cytochrome c high absorption at 408 nm fig s1 and cytochrome aa3 slight increase at 603 nm fig s1 indicated of the restriction of the electron transfer and utilization it was reported that the photoinhibition i e photo oxidation and photo bleaching of cytochrome c an important electron transport carrier in electron transport chain largely replied on the absorbance at 408 nm guerrero 1997 cytochrome aa3 which is a crucial component of complex iv had a higher absorption peak than the control resulting the cleavage of complex iv moreover the oxidation of the amo was observed as indicated by the troughs between 350 and 400 nm in the photoinhibition group fig s1 this was supported by previous studies reporting that light irradiation of resting cells with near ultraviolet uv light inactivated amo and led to obvious decreases in the absorption of 350 400 nm region shears and wood 1985 xu et al 2018 moreover the decrease of etsa and enzyme activity reduced the rate of energy production and atp synthesis led to the failure of multiple cellular functions this implied that nitrifiers might initiate self protection by decreasing metabolic activities e g oxidation of nitrogenous compounds to resist against light inhibition holm et al 2010 on the other hand the momentary high light irradiation with excessive photons and energy might induce membrane lipid peroxidation and even cellular cleavage and apoptosis the significantly increased release rates of ldh observed in the photoinhibition group indicated the injury of cell membrane integrity this was consistent with the enhanced activities of the antioxidation enzymes sod and cat fig 5a and b to scavenge reactive oxygen species ros and other reactive nitrogen species not evaluated in this study venditti et al 2013 similar membrane damage was demonstrated under the conditions of the 300 400 nm wavelength light kelland et al 1983 moreover the light shock with high energy densities might induce the damage of cellular substances the near uv radiation could cause cell membranes injury suppress growth and even kill escherichia coli cells berney et al 2006 and photochemical reactions were motivated for the generation of the dna photoproducts that were lethal to cells bosshard et al 2009 spuhler et al 2010 4 3 light shock with high energy densities promotes more eps excretion the instant light stress with high energy densities stimulates nitrifiers to secrete excessive eps which potentially enhance bacterial adhesion and mutual interactions and act as a three dimensional protection from light thereby improving their resistance to external light stress the eps composition played important roles in cell surface properties mainly by varying the cell surface hydrophobicity and surface charge tsuneda et al 2003 eps polysaccharides were known to be highly hydrophilic with a large number of hydrophilic groups yue et al 2015 and negative charges halder et al 2015 in this study the increased eps protein contents might be the main reason for the enhancement of the bacterial adhesion the higher protein contents possibly resulted in the increase of hydrophobicity and reduced surface charge facilitating bacterial adhesion this was consistent with our recent observation that light irradiation resulted in increased secretions of four kinds of functional eps proteins and their rearranged position contributing to the microalgal flocculation chen et al 2021 the primary reason for the increased eps might be the leakage of intracellular substances caused by the cell membrane damage microbial eps could be generated through multiple pathways such as the active secretion cell surface material shedding adsorption from surrounding environments and cell lysis wingender et al 1999 yu 2020 the intracellular substances were considered to be the most important eps sources in this study after transient high light irradiation the significantly increased ldh release rate indicated the cell membrane damage probably resulting in the transmembrane transport of intracellular substances for eps synthesis li et al 2021 also reported that more eps production was largely attributed to the leakage of intracellular materials through the increased membrane permeability under the co2 stress conditions 4 4 environmental significance this study investigated the metabolic physiological and dynamic responses of aob and nob to the external light shock and for the first time reported that the appropriate light irradiation considering three independent light factors light irradiation power and time sludge concentration had potential to stimulate aob activities further increasing light intensity would result in simultaneous inhibition on both aob and nob these observations enhance current understanding of light effects on nitrifers in activated sludge treating wastewater and meanwhile confirm the feasibility of establishment of nitritation denitritation in mbcp depending on the selective photostimulated aob performance wang et al 2021 compared to conventional nitrification denitrification the light induced nitritation denitritation in the mbcp system has the potential to further reduce the aeration and carbon demands due to the shortened nitrogen transformation pathways as well as produce less sludge besides light irradiation conditions could be optimized to benefit the synergies between microalgae and nitrifiers because the self shielding effects due to the gradual increase of microalgae could provide photoprotection for nitrifiers jia and yuan 2018 kwon et al 2020 moreover although a specific light energy density of es was proposed considering both the light and microbial conditions the findings were obtained using the special mixed sludge cultures with certain aob and nob abundance limiting the results applicability to some extents further investigation with additional sludge sources and enriched or pure aob nob cultures are therefore required to confirm their physiological and molecular light responding characteristics and mechanisms facilitating the development of the mbcp as a sustainable approach for wastewater treatment 5 conclusion the short term effects of three factors light irradiation power irradiation time and sludge concentration on aob and nob were investigated the integrated potential mechanisms for the selective photostimulation and photoinhibition were also proposed our findings suggested that the influence of light irradiation power on nitrifying bacteria was the greatest followed by light irradiation time and sludge concentration moreover the appropriate instant light irradiation with es at 0 0203 0 1571 kj mg 1 vss stimulated aob activities by probably driving electronic transport and energy utilization while es over 0 18 kj mg 1 vss inhibited both aob and nob possibly through the overproduction of oxidative stress and cell membrane damage more eps with increased protein contents was generated to provide three dimensional protection against high light irradiation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

16077,ceramic membranes have drawn increasing attention in oily wastewater treatment as an alternative to their traditional polymeric counterparts yet persistent membrane fouling is still one of the largest challenges particularly little is known about ceramic membrane fouling by oil in water o w emulsions in constant flux filtration modes in this study the effects of emulsion chemistry surfactant concentration ph salinity and ca2 and operation parameters permeate flux and filtration time were comparatively evaluated for alumina and silicon carbide sic deposited ceramic membranes with different physicochemical surface properties the original membranes were made of 100 alumina while the same membranes were also deposited with a sic layer to change the surface charge and hydrophilicity the sic deposited membrane showed a lower reversible and irreversible fouling when permeate flux was below 110 l m 2 h 1 in addition it exhibited a higher permeance recovery after physical and chemical cleaning as compared to the alumina membranes increasing sodium dodecyl sulfate sds concentration in the feed decreased the fouling of both membranes but to a higher extent in the alumina membranes the fouling of both membranes could be reduced with increasing the ph of the emulsion due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion between oil droplets and membrane surface because of the screening of surface charge in a high salinity solution 100 mm nacl only a small difference in irreversible fouling was observed for alumina and sic deposited membranes under these conditions the presence of ca2 in the emulsion led to high irreversible fouling of both membranes because of the compression of diffusion double layer and the interactions between ca2 and sds the low fouling tendency and or high cleaning efficiency of the sic deposited membranes indicated their potential for oily wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic membranes silicon carbide membrane alumina membrane oil in water emulsion membrane fouling 1 introduction oily wastewater is becoming one of the major environmental concerns due to the large generated volumes negative impacts on the aquatic environment and potential threats to human health lin and rutledge 2018 lin et al 2019 especially emulsified oils in oil in water o w emulsions are difficult to remove from a solution due to their small size 20 μm and the high stability caused by the used surfactants which considerably increase repulsive charge between oil droplets with a high zeta potential lu et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf have been widely studied to handle o w emulsions because of their distinct advantages over conventional methods such as high flux steady and good permeate quality compact design and small footprint chen et al 2016 ebrahimi et al 2010 hua et al 2007 ceramic membranes are gaining increasing attention for o w emulsion separation as they have a narrow pore size distribution a higher porosity and higher hydrophilicity than polymeric membranes dong et al 2019 wang et al 2022 wu et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 therefore better reversible and irreversible fouling control in water treatment has been observed than when polymeric membranes are used hofs et al 2011 nagasawa et al 2020 furthermore ceramic membranes can potentially be cleaned with harsh chemicals and backwashed at high pressures due to the high thermal mechanical and chemical stability for enhanced performance recovery which can guarantee a longer service life eray et al 2021 nagasawa et al 2020 shi et al 2022 still fouling of the ceramic membranes is one of the major operational problems as it increases the operational costs of the ceramic membranes during the filtration of o w emulsions it is generally acknowledged that membrane fouling is influenced by membrane properties emulsion characteristics and operational conditions lehman and liu 2009 nagasawa et al 2020 a hydrophilic membrane surface is supposed to be more permeable to water over hydrophobic oil droplets thereby decreasing membrane fouling dickhout et al 2017 in o w emulsions oil droplets are usually charged positively or negatively depending on the type and characteristic of the stabilizing surfactants therefore electrostatic interactions between oil droplets and a charged membrane surface are assumed to play an important role in membrane fouling too however contrasting results regarding the role of electrostatic interaction have been reported for example in uf of o w emulsions stabilized by various types of surfactants matos et al 2016 found that the negatively charged zro2 tio2 ceramic membrane had a higher flux during filtration of an emulsion stabilized with an anionic surfactant it was concluded that the electrostatic repulsion prevents the formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface and thus reduces the fouling however a lower flux was observed when filtering an emulsion stabilized with a cationic surfactant a similar phenomenon was reported by zhang et al 2009 who found that a higher and more stable permeate flux was achieved for mf of an emulsion stabilized with sodium dodecyl sulfate sds anionic using a negatively charged tio2 doped al2o3 membrane in contrast lu et al 2015 found that the tio2 zro2 ceramic membranes had less irreversible fouling and a higher rejection of dissolved organics when challenged with o w emulsions stabilized with an oppositely charged surfactant to the membrane a synergetic steric effect and a demulsification effect were considered as the main reasons for the lower fouling due to the prevention of pore blockage hence there is no consensus in the currently available literature on whether electrostatic repulsion or electrostatic attraction plays a role in ceramic membrane fouling alleviation the contradicting results on the effect of electrostatic interaction on membrane fouling may be explained by the differences in the feed characteristics such as oil droplets size surfactant concentration and salinity in addition these studies were conducted at a constant pressure filtration mode where a decline of permeate flux over time was observed as a result the observed fouling behavior is not only caused by the interaction between oil droplets and membrane surface but also due to the changing hydrodynamic environment and solute concentration near the membrane miller et al 2014b in practice constant flux mf uf filtration is preferred since the rate of permeate flow through the membrane s pores is more constant than in fixed tmp studies the maintained constant hydrodynamic environment near the membrane surface favours the comparison of membrane fouling miller et al 2014a 2014b therefore this study is dedicated to a better understanding of the effect of surface charge of ceramic membranes on membrane fouling in constant flux filtration mode of an o w emulsion stabilized with an anionic surfactant backwashing and multiple filtration cycles were performed in order to distinguish between hydraulic reversible and hydraulic irreversible fouling sds a commonly used anionic surfactant was employed to prepare negatively charged oil droplets al2o3 ceramic membrane and sic deposited ceramic membranes were selected since both al2o3 and sic have a hydrophilic surface but the isoelectric point iep of these two materials is different al2o3 usually has a relatively high iep 8 9 while a low iep 2 3 has been found for sic xu et al 2020 therefore the surface charge of the two membranes would be opposite in a neutral environment potentially leading to different fouling mechanisms in addition other factors like permeate flux sds concentration ph salinity and ca2 concentration were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials mineral oil 330760 sigma aldrich sodium chloride nacl 99 baker analyzed calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o 99 merck

delft water filtered by a reverse osmosis filter a candle filter and a resin vessel was used to prepare the aqueous solution and to rinse the filtration system and membrane samples 2 2 ceramic membranes commercial single channel tubular ceramic al2o3 membranes with a pore size of 100 nm were provided by coorstek industry the netherlands and commercial flat al2o3 membranes were purchased from inopor germany the tubular membranes consist of a selective layer and a support layer both with α al2o3 having an inner diameter of 7 mm an outer diameter of 10 mm and a length of 150 mm the flat membranes have a pore size of 100 nm with a diameter of 100 mm and a thickness of 3 mm the sic deposited membranes were prepared by low pressure chemical vapor deposition lpcvd with al2o3 tubes as support at else kooi lab tu delft the al2o3 tubes were deposited with a thin layer of amorphous sic using two precursors sih2cl2 and c2h2 h2 at a temperature of 750 c and pressure of 80 pa morana et al 2013 three different deposition times 60 90 and 120 min were chosen to obtain sic deposited membranes with various pore sizes more details on the preparation can be found in chen et al 2020a the deposited sic membranes are referred to as d60 d90 d120 corresponding to the deposition time of 60 90 and 120 min respectively the pristine al2o3 membranes are referred to as d0 the characteristics of the membranes are listed in table 1 the flat disk membrane samples were deposited at the same conditions as used for the tubular ones for zeta potential measurements 2 3 membrane characterization the surface charge of the membranes was characterized by the zeta potential with an electrokinetic analyser surpass anton paar graz austria the instrument measures the streaming potential of the solid s surface and then the corresponding zeta potential is automatically calculated using the helmholtz smoluchowski equation nagasawa et al 2020 potassium chloride kcl 5 mm was used as the electrolyte solution while the ph was adjusted by hcl 0 1 m and naoh 0 1 m before the test the flat membrane discs were cut into a rectangular shape 20 10 mm to match the module the samples were measured in a range of ph values from 2 10 with a ph difference of 1 using an automated titration unit the water contact angle of the al2o3 and sic deposited membranes were measured by a contact angle measurement dataphysics oca20 germany the morphology of the ceramic membranes was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscopy sem fei nova nano sem 450 usa the pore size distribution of the

in water emulsion the o w emulsions were prepared by adding 3 ml mineral oil to 2 l of demineralized water in the presence of sds as the stabilizing agent first the emulsion was continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer l23 labinco the netherlands at a speed of 1500 rpm for 36 h and then ultrasonicated 521 bransonic us for 2 h until it appeared milky white afterwards the emulsion was diluted to 6 l with a final oil concentration of 400 mg l 1 for filtration experiments four different sds concentrations 33 66 100 133 mg l 1 were respectively used in order to study the effect of sds concentration on membrane fouling nacl 1 10 100 mm and ca2 1 mm were added into the emulsion with 100 mg l 1 sds to study the effect of ionic strength and ca2 on membrane fouling respectively each filtration run was finished on the same day to reduce the effect of oil droplet aggregates or coalescence the ph of the emulsions was adjusted by hcl 0 1 m and naoh 0 1 m and measured by a ph sensor inolab multi 9420 wtw electrical conductivity of the emulsion was measured by a multi meter inolab multi 9420 wtw the oil droplet size distribution and zeta potential were analyzed in triplicate with a particle size analyzer bluewave microtrac usa and a malvern zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd uk respectively 2 5 fouling experiments with o w emulsions 2 5 1 constant flux crossflow fouling experiments o w emulsion filtration experiments were performed with a constant permeate flux crossflow fouling apparatus fig 1 which has been described in detail in chen et al 2020a the effective filtration area of each membrane module was 0 003 m2 the concentrate valve was closed during filtration and the feed pump dda12 10 grundfos denmark has a controlled flow measured and adjusted by the pump a constant crossflow velocity of 0 44 m s was provided by a circulation pump verdergear verder b v the netherlands because the pressure at the permeate side was equal to atmospheric the tmp was thus determined by the average of the inlet and outlet pressures on the two sides of the membrane module which were monitored by two pressure transducers gs4200 usb esi uk the pressures were continuously logged with a time interval of 30 s to the computer during the filtration the membrane was fouled and the membrane resistance increased resulting in an increase in tmp 2 5 2 filtration protocol the filtration experiments were conducted at room temperature 22 3 c before each filtration experiment the system was thoroughly cleaned with demineralized water to remove residual chemicals and air afterwards the initial water permeance of each membrane was measured at the same permeate fluxes as used for o w filtration with demineralized water the fouling experiment for each membrane consisted of several cycles which were dependent on the filtration conditions permeate flux and emulsion chemistry the filtration cycle was applicable for all membranes each cycle consisted of three phases 1 filtration at a specified flux for a pre set time table 2 2 backwashing the membrane module with demineralized water at a fixed pressure of 3 bar for 30 s to remove hydraulically reversible fouling 3 forward flush with feed emulsion for 15 s to remove the backwash remaining liquids and replace the solution in the loop with the fresh feed three permeate fluxes 90 100 110 l m 2 h 1 were respectively used to compare the membrane performance based on the threshold flux of the membranes because then the effect of membrane surface properties on fouling can be well studied luo et al 2012 and the filtration time for each flux was chosen based on the same volume of permeate production the filtration time per cycle has an effect on membrane fouling therefore two different filtration times were selected at a flux of 110 l m 2 h 1 for comparison when challenged with the oil emulsion with high salinity or ca2 concentration the permeate flux and filtration time were reduced as severe membrane fouling was observed table 2 lists the characteristics of the o w emulsion the permeate flux and the corresponding filtration time per cycle a short filtration time was used as a faster fouling was observed with extended filtration time leading to a decrease in the permeate flux fig s1 in addition in mf uf a filtration time of 15 min is common practice in full scale installations between the various filtration runs the membranes were first backwashed at 3 bar for 30 s and then they were chemically cleaned with a base solution by soaking them in a sodium hydroxide solution 0 01 m naoh for 1 h at 65 c followed by three times rinsing with demineralized water afterwards the membranes were soaked in a citric acid solution 0 01 m for another 1 h at 65 c as recommended in literature fraga et al 2017 zsirai et al 2018 when the permeance of the membranes was not fully recovered after the chemical treatment the membranes were heated at 200 c for 2 h in a muffle furnace nabertherm controller p 300 germany in this way the membrane performance was completely recovered for the next filtration experiment in addition to the filtration experiments where a constant flux was used during each run flux stepping experiments were carried out with d0 and d90 to determine the membrane threshold flux as recommended in literature he et al 2017 miller et al 2014b in this protocol the permeate flux of the membrane was increased stepwise every 20 min from 40 to 80 l m 2 h 1 in an increment of 10 l m 2 h 1 then the flux was further increased by 10 l m 2 h 1 until a flux of 110 l m 2 h 1 was reached with reduced filtration times table s1 as rapid fouling was observed at these high fluxes tmp was continuously monitored during each filtration interval 2 5 3 data analysis the initial pressure for each membrane varied due to the permeance differences in order to better compare the membrane performance the permeance p of the membranes during filtration were normalized to the initial p0 which was determined by the first value in the first cycle where the setting flux was reached the membrane resistance was calculated based on the resistance in series model chen et al 2020a as shown in eq 1 1 r t t m p μ j r m r r r i r where j is the membrane flux m s tmp is the applied trans membrane pressure pa μ is the dynamic viscosity of the permeate pa s rt m 1 represents the total resistance which is consist of intrinsic membrane resistance rm hydraulically reversible resistance rr and irreversible unphysical removable resistance rir rm was determined through the filtration of demineralized water and rt was measured according to the final filtration pressure of each filtration cycle of o w emulsion the fouled membrane was backwashed with demineralized water under a pressure of 3 bar for 30 s and then rr was measured therefore the rir could be calculated from rt rr rm the permeance recovery rp of the membrane was determined by the following equation 2 r p p p 0 100 where p0 is the initial permeance of the clean membrane p is the initial permeance of the fouled membrane after backwashing with demineralized water or cleaning with chemicals the methods used to determine membrane rejection and the results were provided in the supporting information fig s2 s13 and s16 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of oil emulsion and membranes characteristics of o w emulsions prepared at various sds concentrations were evaluated in terms of zeta potential fig 2 a and oil droplet size fig s3 the o w emulsions stabilized with sds were negatively charged with a zeta potential ranging from 65 to 77 mv the majority of the oil droplet sizes were in the range of 1 to 10 µm and a small amount of even smaller oil droplets 70 100 nm was observed when the concentration of sds reached 133 mg l 1 fig s3 the zeta potential of the al2o3 membrane was positive when the ph was lower than 6 while a negative surface charge was observed with a solution ph higher than 6 fig 2b similar results were also reported by nagasawa et al 2020 although in the studies by atallah et al 2017 and kosmulski 2011 the iep of al2o3 membranes was determined to be around 8 or 9 all sic deposited membranes had a negative surface charge in the investigated ph range 2 10 the zeta potentials of d90 and d120 were similar but much lower than that of d0 and d60 possibly due to the thicker sic layer on the sample surface with a longer deposition time yang et al 2021 the results of other characteristics pore size distribution surface morphology surface hydrophilicity and roughness of the membranes are given in the supporting information fig s4 s5 s6 and s7 compared to the pristine al2o3 membrane the deposited membranes had a narrower pore size distribution and smaller average pore sizes 3 2 comparison of membrane fouling of the membranes the al2o3 membrane d0 and the three sic deposited membranes d60 d90 and d120 were compared for o w emulsion filtration in demineralized water at a constant flux of 100 l m 2 h 1 as shown in fig 3 the normalized permeance curve see fig 3a indicates that the pristine al2o3 membrane without sic deposition had the highest fouling tendency despite that the fouling curves were similar for all studied membranes in the first two cycles after the first filtration cycle the permeance of all membranes was recovered suggesting little irreversible fouling however with more filtration cycles irreversible fouling in the membranes gradually increased causing a loss of permeance in the final filtration cycle d90 showed the highest recovery of permeance up to 94 as compared to the other membranes the irreversible and reversible fouling was further evaluated by fouling resistance fig 3 b shows the fouling resistances of the four filtration cycles for all membranes it can be observed that both the reversible and irreversible fouling were high for the al2o3 membrane d0 with a final rr and rir of 14 7 1012 m 1 and 1 5 1012 m 1 respectively deposition of a sic layer at 60 min d60 exhibited a minor influence on membrane fouling control as the final rr and rir were still high however both the reversible and irreversible fouling were considerably alleviated for d90 and d120 especially the fouling of d90 showing a final rr and rir of 9 1011 m 1 and 0 7 1011 m 1 was reduced by 93 and 95 respectively as compared with that of d0 as shown in fig 2b after deposition with a layer of sic on the pristine al2o3 membrane the membrane surface charge was changed from positive to negative at a ph of 5 6 in addition the surface hydrophilicity fig s6 of the membranes was enhanced after the deposition while the surface roughness was not affected as confirmed by sem and afm results fig s5 and s7 as only a thin layer of sic was deposited on the membrane surface of d60 the negative charge of surface was much lower than that of d90 and d120 therefore electrostatic repulsion between the d60 membrane and oil droplets was expected to be weaker leading to more fouling yang et al 2021 the surface hydrophilicity roughness and charge of d90 and d120 were similar fig 2b fig s6 and s7 but higher fouling was found in d120 after four filtration cycles this is most likely because of the smaller pore size and lower permeance of d120 because fouling experiments were operated at constant flux a lower water permeance of the modified membranes implies that filtration was operated at higher pressures which is considered to be crucial for promoting fouling especially at the initial filtration stage kouchaki shalmani et al 2020 a decrease in pore size of d120 would likely increase the local flux when the global permeate flux over the membrane filtration area was the same as with d90 resulting in higher velocities and higher drag forces acting on oil droplets during constant flux filtration thereby increasing fouling kasemset et al 2016 miller et al 2014b therefore when membrane surface properties are similar the membrane with a smaller pore size normally has a smaller permeance leading to a higher fouling tendency in constant flux filtration experiments higher fouling was indeed observed for the least permeable membrane due to the deformation of oil droplets fig s8 and s9 as also found during the studies of fux and ramon 2017 where a clear correlation was observed between the irreversible fouling and the degree of droplet deformation imaged by a confocal microscopy because a constant backwash pressure was used in the experiments a higher backwash efficiency was found for membranes with higher permeance due to the higher backwash velocity as also suggested by vroman et al 2020 from the above results it was concluded that d90 showed the best fouling control in sic deposited membranes therefore d90 and d0 were further used to study the effects of permeate flux sds concentration ph salinity and ca2 concentration on membrane performance in the following sections 3 3 effect of permeate flux the threshold fluxes of the membrane d0 and d90 were 93 and 87 l m 2 h 1 respectively as determined by the flux stepping methods fig s10 and s11 therefore three different permeate fluxes 90 100 110 l m 2 h 1 were compared to study their effect on membrane fouling at the flux of 90 l m 2 h 1 close to the threshold flux fouling of the membranes is mainly determined by the foulant membrane interaction when the flux is above the threshold flux 100 and 110 l m 2 h 1 foulant membrane and foulant deposited foulant interactions can be investigated under this condition luo et al 2012 the effect of permeate flux on the filtration of the o w emulsion with the sic deposited membrane d90 and al2o3 membrane d0 is shown in fig 4 at a flux of 90 l m 2 h 1 some fouling was observed in both membranes as permeance declined with time the normalized permeance curves of the two membranes were parallel and overlapped in the first two cycles indicating that reversible fouling was similar with more filtration cycles the permeance curves of d0 shifted down which was not observed in d90 suggesting that irreversible fouling happened in d0 fig 4a when the permeate flux increased from 90 to 100 l m 2 h 1 irreversible fouling became larger for both d0 and d90 as observed by lower initial normalized permeance of each cycle the normalized permeance 84 recovery of d90 was still higher than that 64 recovery of d0 in the final cycle at the flux of 100 l m 2 h 1 during fouling experiments higher fluxes bring larger amounts of emulsified oil foulants per time unit to the membrane surface increasing foulant accumulation on the membrane miller et al 2014a 2014b on the other hand higher fluxes cause a stronger drag force acting on oil droplets which consequently lead to the deformation and coalescence of attached droplets and squeezing of oil droplets across the membrane pores resulting in irreversible fouling of the membrane fig 4d chen et al 2020b tummons et al 2017 as shown in fig 4c with a further increase in the flux to 110 l m 2 h 1 a much higher irreversible fouling was observed in d90 compared to the lower fluxes and close to that of d0 at this high flux oil coalescence and internal fouling are more likely to occur and therefore hydraulic cleaning became ineffective to remove the oil film zhu et al 2017 when the water production during a filtration cycle was the same at the three studied fluxes lower fouling was observed at a lower flux however further shortening the filtration time to 14 min per cycle at the highest flux 110 l m 2 h 1 could control the fouling especially for sic deposited membrane fig s12 in this case permeance recovery of sic deposited membrane increased from 71 to 94 which was higher than that 84 of the al2o3 membrane 3 4 effect of sds concentration the effect of sds concentration on fouling of the al2o3 membrane d0 and sic deposited membrane d90 is shown in fig 5 at a low concentration of sds 33 mg l 1 the fouling of d90 was much less than that of d0 which can be observed by terminal normalized permeance and the recovery of the permeance of each cycle fig 5a the higher ir reversible fouling of d0 was attributed to the lack of electrostatic repulsion between the membrane and oil droplets increasing the concentration of sds in the feed had a positive effect on the fouling of both membranes especially on the d0 as observed in fig 5b the permeance recovery in the final cycle of d0 and d90 increased from 61 to 70 and from 81 to 87 when the concentration of sds was increased from 33 to 100 mg l 1 respectively with a further increase in the sds concentration in the feed to 133 mg l 1 the fouling difference between d0 and d90 was further reduced with a permeance recovery of 81 and 90 in the final cycle respectively similar results were reported by virga et al 2020 who found that less flux decline was observed for mf of an sds stabilized o w emulsion with a commercial sic membrane when sds concentration increased from 0 1 to 1 times the critical micelle concentration cmc as sds concentration was high up to the cmc o w interfacial tension was considerably decreased potentially leading to oil permeation through the membrane rather than accumulating on the membrane surface or in the pores as a result a higher permeate flux was observed however this mechanism cannot explain the results observed in our work as the highest used sds concentration 133 mg l 1 was less than 0 06 times the cmc in addition no variations in oil rejection were observed for emulsions stabilized with different sds concentrations fig s13 the reversible and irreversible fouling of d0 and d90 was also evaluated by the fouling resistances fig s14 the rr and rir of d0 were considerably decreased from 46 1012 m 1 to 1 53 1012 m 1 and from 3 57 1012 m 1 to 0 7 1012 m 1 respectively when the concentration of sds was increased from 33 to 133 mgl 1 however the rr and rir of d90 were only slightly decreased from 3 1 1012 m 1 to 1 2 1012 m 1 and from 0 95 1012 m 1 to 0 4 1012 m 1 respectively the sic deposited membrane was negatively charged while the al2o3 membrane had a positive surface charge at a ph of 5 6 fig 2b a higher negative charge of the emulsion was observed with increasing sds concentration as determined with the zeta potential of the emulsions prepared with various sds concentrations fig 2a according to the adsorption model proposed by gu and zhu 1990 the adsorption of surfactant at the liquid solid surface takes place in two steps in the first step the head groups of surfactant monomers preferably adhere to the hydrophilic membrane surfaces to form the first layer subsequently a second layer is adsorbed on the first one nguyen et al 2015 in addition a slight decline of permeance of the al2o3 membrane was observed for sds solution filtration indicating that sds was adsorbed on the al2o3 membrane however no adsorption of sds on the sic deposited ceramic membranes was observed as the permeance maintained constant fig s15 therefore the following fouling mechanism was proposed and is schematically shown in fig 6 at a low sds concentration 33 mg l 1 most of the surfactants were used to stabilize the oil droplets leaving a low concentration of free sds monomers in the solution the negatively charged head of the sds and hydrophilic will be attached to the positively charged al2o3 membrane surface due to electrostatic attraction leaving the hydrophobic tails towards the bulk phase dobson et al 2000 this forms a hydrophobic surfactant monolayer on the surface and therefore increases the fouling of d0 fernández et al 2005 matos et al 2016 increasing the sds concentration however will result in a higher concentration of free surfactant monomers in the solution and probably a new monolayer is formed on top of the pre covered single monolayer on the membrane surface in this case the hydrophilic head and negatively charged of sds is oriented towards the bulk phase as a result of hydrophobic interactions thus the surface charge of the al2o3 membrane is reversed from positive to negative and again hydrophilic which prevents the adsorption of oil droplets and alleviates the membrane fouling the charge inversion of the membrane by surfactant has also been reported by trinh et al 2019 who found that surfactant soaked membranes had the same charge as the surfactant stabilized emulsion regardless of the surfactant type however surfactants and oil droplets can be hardly adsorbed on the membrane surface and in the membrane pores of the sic deposited membranes due to electrostatic repulsion lin and rutledge 2018 zhang et al 2009 the slightly improved fouling resistance of the sic deposited membranes can be ascribed to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion between the membrane and oil droplets with increased sds concentration in the feed 3 5 effect of ph to determine the effect of ph on membrane fouling filtration experiments were conducted at three different ph values fig 7 we chose ph 5 6 as the starting point to study the fouling of the two membranes as it is the native ph of the fresh o w emulsion in addition this ph is commonly observed in oily wastewater wenzlick and siefert 2020 in all cases the fouling was less in the sic deposited membrane than in the al2o3 membrane in addition both membranes experienced a decrease of fouling with an increase in ph specifically the normalized initial permeance of d0 and d90 in the final filtration cycle increased from 64 to 89 and 85 to 93 when ph increased from 5 6 to 10 respectively this ph dependency can be attributed to the fact that as ph increases the surface charge of the membrane becomes more negative zhang et al 2009 as shown in fig 2a the zeta potential of the sic deposited membrane d90 decreased from 37 mv to 44 mv with an increase in ph from 5 6 to 10 respectively consequently the membrane surface was less prone to be fouled by the negatively charged oil droplets due to the stronger electrostatic repulsion however the surface charge of the al2o3 membrane was positive at a ph of 5 6 and therefore more fouling was observed as it favourably interacted with the negatively charged solutes the positively charged 8 mv surface was changed into negative 49 mv when filtering the feed with a ph of 10 and therefore electrostatic interaction became repulsive and contributed to decreased fouling abadikhah et al 2018 lee and kim 2014 although the zeta potentials of al2o3 and sic deposited membranes were similar at a ph of 10 the fouling of the sic deposited membrane was still lower than that of the al2o3 membrane this can possibly be ascribed to the stronger hydrophilic surface of the sic deposited membrane water contact angle 0 than that of the al2o3 membrane water contact angle 25 fig s6 xu et al 2020 also compared the fouling of al2o3 and sic hollow fiber membranes for mf of o w emulsions a higher flux was observed for the more hydrophilic sic membrane 3 6 effect of salinity and ca2 it has been reported that the surface charge of oil emulsions and membranes decreases with the concentration of nacl due to the compressed electrical double layer he et al 2017 tanudjaja et al 2017 although the droplet size of oil was not changed with the salinity fig s3 as shown in fig 8 the fouling of both d0 and d90 became higher when nacl concentration increased from 1 mm to 100 mm however the fouling of d90 was much lower than that of d0 when nacl concentration was lower or equal to 10 mm this indicates that the surface charge of the sic deposited membrane still had an effect on the fouling by oily wastewater with relatively low salinity whereas much more fouling was observed for both membranes when nacl concentration reached 100 mm at that salinity 100 mm nacl the flux recovery of d90 was close to that of d0 suggesting that irreversible fouling of the two membranes were similar probably because oil droplets were not easily lifted off the membrane with backwash due to charge screening and an increase of cake layer density dickhout et al 2019 he and vidic 2016 divalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 can also be present in oily wastewater their presence may accelerate membrane fouling due to more compression of the diffusion double layer compared to monovalent ions dickhout et al 2017 as shown in fig 8d the membrane fouling was worse when 1 mm ca2 was added to the emulsions and the backwashing was not effective anymore to restore the permeance therefore the irreversible fouling was considered to be the main contributor to the membrane fouling this can be explained by two effects of ca2 in the emulsion 1 lower electrostatic charge of oil droplets and membranes are to be expected due to a compressed electrostatic layer when ca2 is present in the emulsion hong and elimelech 1997 therefore droplet coalescence on the membrane surface is promoted leading to a less permeable cake layer tummons et al 2017 2 sds can interact with divalent ca2 which may cause the formation of a complex between ca2 and the sulfate group of sds panpanit et al 2000 sammalkorpi et al 2009 as a result less sds molecules exist in the emulsion as confirmed by permeate cod fig s16 leading to a higher irreversible fouling of the membranes virga et al 2020 however the irreversible fouling of d90 was still lower than that of d0 even though the electrostatic repulsion became weaker tummons et al 2017 studied the effect of mg2 on the fouling of an al2o3 uf membrane by sds stabilized emulsions the presence of mg2 6 7 mm in the emulsion was observed to promote the coalescence of oil droplets on the membrane surface leading to a higher flux decline of the membrane due to the less porosity of the cake layer when the mg2 concentration was sufficiently high 42 6 mm attached oil droplets coalesced to reach a critical size which can probably be removed by crossflow to minimize the fouling in the constant pressure filtration condition 3 7 membrane cleaning efficiency after filtration of o w emulsions at high fluxes during multiple cycles accumulation of irreversible fouling in membranes was inevitable the permeance recovery of d0 and d90 were compared after backwashing after naoh 0 01 m and after citric acid 0 01 m cleaning fig 9 the efficiency of backwashing was investigated after six cycles of filtration at a flux of 110 l m 2 h 1 as was previously shown in fig 3c the permeance recovery after backwashing of d90 64 was higher than that of d0 45 probably due to less sticky fouling in the membrane and to a more efficient backwashing after soaking the membranes in naoh 0 01 m solution at 65 c for 1 h the permeance recovery of d0 and d90 reached up to 80 and 84 respectively the permeance of d90 could be further recovered to 98 after citric acid 0 01 m 65 c treatment for 1 h while the permeance of d0 could only be recovered to 84 a high permeance recovery 100 was also observed by fraga et al 2017 when using both acid and alkaline solutions to clean sic membranes at 60 5 c after filtration of oily wastewater however the permeance recovery of d90 was lower but still higher than that of d0 after filtration of o w emulsions with either high salinity 100 mm nacl or the presence of ca2 fig s17 4 conclusion the performance of al2o3 and sic deposited ceramic membranes was systematically compared during constant flux filtration of o w emulsion with multiple filtration cycles both the operation and solution chemistry parameters affected the membrane fouling while the extents varied depending on the emulsion characteristics and operational parameters the following conclusions were drawn 1 sic deposited membranes had a lower reversible and irreversible fouling than al2o3 membranes when in multiple filtration cycles the permeate flux was smaller or equal to 100 l m 2 h 1 the fouling of both membranes was similar when the flux reached to 110 l m 2 h 1 2 increasing the concentration of sds in the feed decreased fouling of both membranes and a larger effect was observed for the al2o3 membrane the improved fouling resistance of the al2o3 membrane can be ascribed to the effect of surfactant adsorption and charge inversion while the enhanced electrostatic repulsion between the membrane and oil droplets was responsible for the lower fouling of the sic deposited membrane 3 the fouling of both al2o3 and sic deposited membranes was reduced with increased ph due to the more negative zeta potential of the membrane surface and thus a stronger electrostatic repulsion 4 the fouling of the sic deposited membrane was less with a low salinity emulsion 1 and 10 mm nacl while only a small difference in irreversible fouling was observed for al2o3 and sic deposited membranes for high salinity emulsions 100 mm nacl due to charge screening effect 5 the presence of a low concentration of ca2 1 mm in the emulsion led to high irreversible fouling for both membranes 6 the chemical cleaning efficiency of the sic deposited membrane was higher than that of the al2o3 membrane declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

16077,ceramic membranes have drawn increasing attention in oily wastewater treatment as an alternative to their traditional polymeric counterparts yet persistent membrane fouling is still one of the largest challenges particularly little is known about ceramic membrane fouling by oil in water o w emulsions in constant flux filtration modes in this study the effects of emulsion chemistry surfactant concentration ph salinity and ca2 and operation parameters permeate flux and filtration time were comparatively evaluated for alumina and silicon carbide sic deposited ceramic membranes with different physicochemical surface properties the original membranes were made of 100 alumina while the same membranes were also deposited with a sic layer to change the surface charge and hydrophilicity the sic deposited membrane showed a lower reversible and irreversible fouling when permeate flux was below 110 l m 2 h 1 in addition it exhibited a higher permeance recovery after physical and chemical cleaning as compared to the alumina membranes increasing sodium dodecyl sulfate sds concentration in the feed decreased the fouling of both membranes but to a higher extent in the alumina membranes the fouling of both membranes could be reduced with increasing the ph of the emulsion due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion between oil droplets and membrane surface because of the screening of surface charge in a high salinity solution 100 mm nacl only a small difference in irreversible fouling was observed for alumina and sic deposited membranes under these conditions the presence of ca2 in the emulsion led to high irreversible fouling of both membranes because of the compression of diffusion double layer and the interactions between ca2 and sds the low fouling tendency and or high cleaning efficiency of the sic deposited membranes indicated their potential for oily wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic membranes silicon carbide membrane alumina membrane oil in water emulsion membrane fouling 1 introduction oily wastewater is becoming one of the major environmental concerns due to the large generated volumes negative impacts on the aquatic environment and potential threats to human health lin and rutledge 2018 lin et al 2019 especially emulsified oils in oil in water o w emulsions are difficult to remove from a solution due to their small size 20 μm and the high stability caused by the used surfactants which considerably increase repulsive charge between oil droplets with a high zeta potential lu et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf have been widely studied to handle o w emulsions because of their distinct advantages over conventional methods such as high flux steady and good permeate quality compact design and small footprint chen et al 2016 ebrahimi et al 2010 hua et al 2007 ceramic membranes are gaining increasing attention for o w emulsion separation as they have a narrow pore size distribution a higher porosity and higher hydrophilicity than polymeric membranes dong et al 2019 wang et al 2022 wu et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 therefore better reversible and irreversible fouling control in water treatment has been observed than when polymeric membranes are used hofs et al 2011 nagasawa et al 2020 furthermore ceramic membranes can potentially be cleaned with harsh chemicals and backwashed at high pressures due to the high thermal mechanical and chemical stability for enhanced performance recovery which can guarantee a longer service life eray et al 2021 nagasawa et al 2020 shi et al 2022 still fouling of the ceramic membranes is one of the major operational problems as it increases the operational costs of the ceramic membranes during the filtration of o w emulsions it is generally acknowledged that membrane fouling is influenced by membrane properties emulsion characteristics and operational conditions lehman and liu 2009 nagasawa et al 2020 a hydrophilic membrane surface is supposed to be more permeable to water over hydrophobic oil droplets thereby decreasing membrane fouling dickhout et al 2017 in o w emulsions oil droplets are usually charged positively or negatively depending on the type and characteristic of the stabilizing surfactants therefore electrostatic interactions between oil droplets and a charged membrane surface are assumed to play an important role in membrane fouling too however contrasting results regarding the role of electrostatic interaction have been reported for example in uf of o w emulsions stabilized by various types of surfactants matos et al 2016 found that the negatively charged zro2 tio2 ceramic membrane had a higher flux during filtration of an emulsion stabilized with an anionic surfactant it was concluded that the electrostatic repulsion prevents the formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface and thus reduces the fouling however a lower flux was observed when filtering an emulsion stabilized with a cationic surfactant a similar phenomenon was reported by zhang et al 2009 who found that a higher and more stable permeate flux was achieved for mf of an emulsion stabilized with sodium dodecyl sulfate sds anionic using a negatively charged tio2 doped al2o3 membrane in contrast lu et al 2015 found that the tio2 zro2 ceramic membranes had less irreversible fouling and a higher rejection of dissolved organics when challenged with o w emulsions stabilized with an oppositely charged surfactant to the membrane a synergetic steric effect and a demulsification effect were considered as the main reasons for the lower fouling due to the prevention of pore blockage hence there is no consensus in the currently available literature on whether electrostatic repulsion or electrostatic attraction plays a role in ceramic membrane fouling alleviation the contradicting results on the effect of electrostatic interaction on membrane fouling may be explained by the differences in the feed characteristics such as oil droplets size surfactant concentration and salinity in addition these studies were conducted at a constant pressure filtration mode where a decline of permeate flux over time was observed as a result the observed fouling behavior is not only caused by the interaction between oil droplets and membrane surface but also due to the changing hydrodynamic environment and solute concentration near the membrane miller et al 2014b in practice constant flux mf uf filtration is preferred since the rate of permeate flow through the membrane s pores is more constant than in fixed tmp studies the maintained constant hydrodynamic environment near the membrane surface favours the comparison of membrane fouling miller et al 2014a 2014b therefore this study is dedicated to a better understanding of the effect of surface charge of ceramic membranes on membrane fouling in constant flux filtration mode of an o w emulsion stabilized with an anionic surfactant backwashing and multiple filtration cycles were performed in order to distinguish between hydraulic reversible and hydraulic irreversible fouling sds a commonly used anionic surfactant was employed to prepare negatively charged oil droplets al2o3 ceramic membrane and sic deposited ceramic membranes were selected since both al2o3 and sic have a hydrophilic surface but the isoelectric point iep of these two materials is different al2o3 usually has a relatively high iep 8 9 while a low iep 2 3 has been found for sic xu et al 2020 therefore the surface charge of the two membranes would be opposite in a neutral environment potentially leading to different fouling mechanisms in addition other factors like permeate flux sds concentration ph salinity and ca2 concentration were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials mineral oil 330760 sigma aldrich sodium chloride nacl 99 baker analyzed calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o 99 merck

concentration on membrane fouling nacl 1 10 100 mm and ca2 1 mm were added into the emulsion with 100 mg l 1 sds to study the effect of ionic strength and ca2 on membrane fouling respectively each filtration run was finished on the same day to reduce the effect of oil droplet aggregates or coalescence the ph of the emulsions was adjusted by hcl 0 1 m and naoh 0 1 m and measured by a ph sensor inolab multi 9420 wtw electrical conductivity of the emulsion was measured by a multi meter inolab multi 9420 wtw the oil droplet size distribution and zeta potential were analyzed in triplicate with a particle size analyzer bluewave microtrac usa and a malvern zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd uk respectively 2 5 fouling experiments with o w emulsions 2 5 1 constant flux crossflow fouling experiments o w emulsion filtration experiments were performed with a constant permeate flux crossflow fouling apparatus fig 1 which has been described in detail in chen et al 2020a the effective filtration area of each membrane module was 0 003 m2 the concentrate valve was closed during filtration and the feed pump dda12 10 grundfos denmark has a controlled flow measured and adjusted by the pump a constant crossflow velocity of 0 44 m s was provided by a circulation pump verdergear verder b v the netherlands because the pressure at the permeate side was equal to atmospheric the tmp was thus determined by the average of the inlet and outlet pressures on the two sides of the membrane module which were monitored by two pressure transducers gs4200 usb esi uk the pressures were continuously logged with a time interval of 30 s to the computer during the filtration the membrane was fouled and the membrane resistance increased resulting in an increase in tmp 2 5 2 filtration protocol the filtration experiments were conducted at room temperature 22 3 c before each filtration experiment the system was thoroughly cleaned with demineralized water to remove residual chemicals and air afterwards the initial water permeance of each membrane was measured at the same permeate fluxes as used for o w filtration with demineralized water the fouling experiment for each membrane consisted of several cycles which were dependent on the filtration conditions permeate flux and emulsion chemistry the filtration cycle was applicable for all membranes each cycle consisted of three phases 1 filtration at a specified flux for a pre set time table 2 2 backwashing the membrane module with demineralized water at a fixed pressure of 3 bar for 30 s to remove hydraulically reversible fouling 3 forward flush with feed emulsion for 15 s to remove the backwash remaining liquids and replace the solution in the loop with the fresh feed three permeate fluxes 90 100 110 l m 2 h 1 were respectively used to compare the membrane performance based on the threshold flux of the membranes because then the effect of membrane surface properties on fouling can be well studied luo et al 2012 and the filtration time for each flux was chosen based on the same volume of permeate production the filtration time per cycle has an effect on membrane fouling therefore two different filtration times were selected at a flux of 110 l m 2 h 1 for comparison when challenged with the oil emulsion with high salinity or ca2 concentration the permeate flux and filtration time were reduced as severe membrane fouling was observed table 2 lists the characteristics of the o w emulsion the permeate flux and the corresponding filtration time per cycle a short filtration time was used as a faster fouling was observed with extended filtration time leading to a decrease in the permeate flux fig s1 in addition in mf uf a filtration time of 15 min is common practice in full scale installations between the various filtration runs the membranes were first backwashed at 3 bar for 30 s and then they were chemically cleaned with a base solution by soaking them in a sodium hydroxide solution 0 01 m naoh for 1 h at 65 c followed by three times rinsing with demineralized water afterwards the membranes were soaked in a citric acid solution 0 01 m for another 1 h at 65 c as recommended in literature fraga et al 2017 zsirai et al 2018 when the permeance of the membranes was not fully recovered after the chemical treatment the membranes were heated at 200 c for 2 h in a muffle furnace nabertherm controller p 300 germany in this way the membrane performance was completely recovered for the next filtration experiment in addition to the filtration experiments where a constant flux was used during each run flux stepping experiments were carried out with d0 and d90 to determine the membrane threshold flux as recommended in literature he et al 2017 miller et al 2014b in this protocol the permeate flux of the membrane was increased stepwise every 20 min from 40 to 80 l m 2 h 1 in an increment of 10 l m 2 h 1 then the flux was further increased by 10 l m 2 h 1 until a flux of 110 l m 2 h 1 was reached with reduced filtration times table s1 as rapid fouling was observed at these high fluxes tmp was continuously monitored during each filtration interval 2 5 3 data analysis the initial pressure for each membrane varied due to the permeance differences in order to better compare the membrane performance the permeance p of the membranes during filtration were normalized to the initial p0 which was determined by the first value in the first cycle where the setting flux was reached the membrane resistance was calculated based on the resistance in series model chen et al 2020a as shown in eq 1 1 r t t m p μ j r m r r r i r where j is the membrane flux m s tmp is the applied trans membrane pressure pa μ is the dynamic viscosity of the permeate pa s rt m 1 represents the total resistance which is consist of intrinsic membrane resistance rm hydraulically reversible resistance rr and irreversible unphysical removable resistance rir rm was determined through the filtration of demineralized water and rt was measured according to the final filtration pressure of each filtration cycle of o w emulsion the fouled membrane was backwashed with demineralized water under a pressure of 3 bar for 30 s and then rr was measured therefore the rir could be calculated from rt rr rm the permeance recovery rp of the membrane was determined by the following equation 2 r p p p 0 100 where p0 is the initial permeance of the clean membrane p is the initial permeance of the fouled membrane after backwashing with demineralized water or cleaning with chemicals the methods used to determine membrane rejection and the results were provided in the supporting information fig s2 s13 and s16 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of oil emulsion and membranes characteristics of o w emulsions prepared at various sds concentrations were evaluated in terms of zeta potential fig 2 a and oil droplet size fig s3 the o w emulsions stabilized with sds were negatively charged with a zeta potential ranging from 65 to 77 mv the majority of the oil droplet sizes were in the range of 1 to 10 µm and a small amount of even smaller oil droplets 70 100 nm was observed when the concentration of sds reached 133 mg l 1 fig s3 the zeta potential of the al2o3 membrane was positive when the ph was lower than 6 while a negative surface charge was observed with a solution ph higher than 6 fig 2b similar results were also reported by nagasawa et al 2020 although in the studies by atallah et al 2017 and kosmulski 2011 the iep of al2o3 membranes was determined to be around 8 or 9 all sic deposited membranes had a negative surface charge in the investigated ph range 2 10 the zeta potentials of d90 and d120 were similar but much lower than that of d0 and d60 possibly due to the thicker sic layer on the sample surface with a longer deposition time yang et al 2021 the results of other characteristics pore size distribution surface morphology surface hydrophilicity and roughness of the membranes are given in the supporting information fig s4 s5 s6 and s7 compared to the pristine al2o3 membrane the deposited membranes had a narrower pore size distribution and smaller average pore sizes 3 2 comparison of membrane fouling of the membranes the al2o3 membrane d0 and the three sic deposited membranes d60 d90 and d120 were compared for o w emulsion filtration in demineralized water at a constant flux of 100 l m 2 h 1 as shown in fig 3 the normalized permeance curve see fig 3a indicates that the pristine al2o3 membrane without sic deposition had the highest fouling tendency despite that the fouling curves were similar for all studied membranes in the first two cycles after the first filtration cycle the permeance of all membranes was recovered suggesting little irreversible fouling however with more filtration cycles irreversible fouling in the membranes gradually increased causing a loss of permeance in the final filtration cycle d90 showed the highest recovery of permeance up to 94 as compared to the other membranes the irreversible and reversible fouling was further evaluated by fouling resistance fig 3 b shows the fouling resistances of the four filtration cycles for all membranes it can be observed that both the reversible and irreversible fouling were high for the al2o3 membrane d0 with a final rr and rir of 14 7 1012 m 1 and 1 5 1012 m 1 respectively deposition of a sic layer at 60 min d60 exhibited a minor influence on membrane fouling control as the final rr and rir were still high however both the reversible and irreversible fouling were considerably alleviated for d90 and d120 especially the fouling of d90 showing a final rr and rir of 9 1011 m 1 and 0 7 1011 m 1 was reduced by 93 and 95 respectively as compared with that of d0 as shown in fig 2b after deposition with a layer of sic on the pristine al2o3 membrane the membrane surface charge was changed from positive to negative at a ph of 5 6 in addition the surface hydrophilicity fig s6 of the membranes was enhanced after the deposition while the surface roughness was not affected as confirmed by sem and afm results fig s5 and s7 as only a thin layer of sic was deposited on the membrane surface of d60 the negative charge of surface was much lower than that of d90 and d120 therefore electrostatic repulsion between the d60 membrane and oil droplets was expected to be weaker leading to more fouling yang et al 2021 the surface hydrophilicity roughness and charge of d90 and d120 were similar fig 2b fig s6 and s7 but higher fouling was found in d120 after four filtration cycles this is most likely because of the smaller pore size and lower permeance of d120 because fouling experiments were operated at constant flux a lower water permeance of the modified membranes implies that filtration was operated at higher pressures which is considered to be crucial for promoting fouling especially at the initial filtration stage kouchaki shalmani et al 2020 a decrease in pore size of d120 would likely increase the local flux when the global permeate flux over the membrane filtration area was the same as with d90 resulting in higher velocities and higher drag forces acting on oil droplets during constant flux filtration thereby increasing fouling kasemset et al 2016 miller et al 2014b therefore when membrane surface properties are similar the membrane with a smaller pore size normally has a smaller permeance leading to a higher fouling tendency in constant flux filtration experiments higher fouling was indeed observed for the least permeable membrane due to the deformation of oil droplets fig s8 and s9 as also found during the studies of fux and ramon 2017 where a clear correlation was observed between the irreversible fouling and the degree of droplet deformation imaged by a confocal microscopy because a constant backwash pressure was used in the experiments a higher backwash efficiency was found for membranes with higher permeance due to the higher backwash velocity as also suggested by vroman et al 2020 from the above results it was concluded that d90 showed the best fouling control in sic deposited membranes therefore d90 and d0 were further used to study the effects of permeate flux sds concentration ph salinity and ca2 concentration on membrane performance in the following sections 3 3 effect of permeate flux the threshold fluxes of the membrane d0 and d90 were 93 and 87 l m 2 h 1 respectively as determined by the flux stepping methods fig s10 and s11 therefore three different permeate fluxes 90 100 110 l m 2 h 1 were compared to study their effect on membrane fouling at the flux of 90 l m 2 h 1 close to the threshold flux fouling of the membranes is mainly determined by the foulant membrane interaction when the flux is above the threshold flux 100 and 110 l m 2 h 1 foulant membrane and foulant deposited foulant interactions can be investigated under this condition luo et al 2012 the effect of permeate flux on the filtration of the o w emulsion with the sic deposited membrane d90 and al2o3 membrane d0 is shown in fig 4 at a flux of 90 l m 2 h 1 some fouling was observed in both membranes as permeance declined with time the normalized permeance curves of the two membranes were parallel and overlapped in the first two cycles indicating that reversible fouling was similar with more filtration cycles the permeance curves of d0 shifted down which was not observed in d90 suggesting that irreversible fouling happened in d0 fig 4a when the permeate flux increased from 90 to 100 l m 2 h 1 irreversible fouling became larger for both d0 and d90 as observed by lower initial normalized permeance of each cycle the normalized permeance 84 recovery of d90 was still higher than that 64 recovery of d0 in the final cycle at the flux of 100 l m 2 h 1 during fouling experiments higher fluxes bring larger amounts of emulsified oil foulants per time unit to the membrane surface increasing foulant accumulation on the membrane miller et al 2014a 2014b on the other hand higher fluxes cause a stronger drag force acting on oil droplets which consequently lead to the deformation and coalescence of attached droplets and squeezing of oil droplets across the membrane pores resulting in irreversible fouling of the membrane fig 4d chen et al 2020b tummons et al 2017 as shown in fig 4c with a further increase in the flux to 110 l m 2 h 1 a much higher irreversible fouling was observed in d90 compared to the lower fluxes and close to that of d0 at this high flux oil coalescence and internal fouling are more likely to occur and therefore hydraulic cleaning became ineffective to remove the oil film zhu et al 2017 when the water production during a filtration cycle was the same at the three studied fluxes lower fouling was observed at a lower flux however further shortening the filtration time to 14 min per cycle at the highest flux 110 l m 2 h 1 could control the fouling especially for sic deposited membrane fig s12 in this case permeance recovery of sic deposited membrane increased from 71 to 94 which was higher than that 84 of the al2o3 membrane 3 4 effect of sds concentration the effect of sds concentration on fouling of the al2o3 membrane d0 and sic deposited membrane d90 is shown in fig 5 at a low concentration of sds 33 mg l 1 the fouling of d90 was much less than that of d0 which can be observed by terminal normalized permeance and the recovery of the permeance of each cycle fig 5a the higher ir reversible fouling of d0 was attributed to the lack of electrostatic repulsion between the membrane and oil droplets increasing the concentration of sds in the feed had a positive effect on the fouling of both membranes especially on the d0 as observed in fig 5b the permeance recovery in the final cycle of d0 and d90 increased from 61 to 70 and from 81 to 87 when the concentration of sds was increased from 33 to 100 mg l 1 respectively with a further increase in the sds concentration in the feed to 133 mg l 1 the fouling difference between d0 and d90 was further reduced with a permeance recovery of 81 and 90 in the final cycle respectively similar results were reported by virga et al 2020 who found that less flux decline was observed for mf of an sds stabilized o w emulsion with a commercial sic membrane when sds concentration increased from 0 1 to 1 times the critical micelle concentration cmc as sds concentration was high up to the cmc o w interfacial tension was considerably decreased potentially leading to oil permeation through the membrane rather than accumulating on the membrane surface or in the pores as a result a higher permeate flux was observed however this mechanism cannot explain the results observed in our work as the highest used sds concentration 133 mg l 1 was less than 0 06 times the cmc in addition no variations in oil rejection were observed for emulsions stabilized with different sds concentrations fig s13 the reversible and irreversible fouling of d0 and d90 was also evaluated by the fouling resistances fig s14 the rr and rir of d0 were considerably decreased from 46 1012 m 1 to 1 53 1012 m 1 and from 3 57 1012 m 1 to 0 7 1012 m 1 respectively when the concentration of sds was increased from 33 to 133 mgl 1 however the rr and rir of d90 were only slightly decreased from 3 1 1012 m 1 to 1 2 1012 m 1 and from 0 95 1012 m 1 to 0 4 1012 m 1 respectively the sic deposited membrane was negatively charged while the al2o3 membrane had a positive surface charge at a ph of 5 6 fig 2b a higher negative charge of the emulsion was observed with increasing sds concentration as determined with the zeta potential of the emulsions prepared with various sds concentrations fig 2a according to the adsorption model proposed by gu and zhu 1990 the adsorption of surfactant at the liquid solid surface takes place in two steps in the first step the head groups of surfactant monomers preferably adhere to the hydrophilic membrane surfaces to form the first layer subsequently a second layer is adsorbed on the first one nguyen et al 2015 in addition a slight decline of permeance of the al2o3 membrane was observed for sds solution filtration indicating that sds was adsorbed on the al2o3 membrane however no adsorption of sds on the sic deposited ceramic membranes was observed as the permeance maintained constant fig s15 therefore the following fouling mechanism was proposed and is schematically shown in fig 6 at a low sds concentration 33 mg l 1 most of the surfactants were used to stabilize the oil droplets leaving a low concentration of free sds monomers in the solution the negatively charged head of the sds and hydrophilic will be attached to the positively charged al2o3 membrane surface due to electrostatic attraction leaving the hydrophobic tails towards the bulk phase dobson et al 2000 this forms a hydrophobic surfactant monolayer on the surface and therefore increases the fouling of d0 fernández et al 2005 matos et al 2016 increasing the sds concentration however will result in a higher concentration of free surfactant monomers in the solution and probably a new monolayer is formed on top of the pre covered single monolayer on the membrane surface in this case the hydrophilic head and negatively charged of sds is oriented towards the bulk phase as a result of hydrophobic interactions thus the surface charge of the al2o3 membrane is reversed from positive to negative and again hydrophilic which prevents the adsorption of oil droplets and alleviates the membrane fouling the charge inversion of the membrane by surfactant has also been reported by trinh et al 2019 who found that surfactant soaked membranes had the same charge as the surfactant stabilized emulsion regardless of the surfactant type however surfactants and oil droplets can be hardly adsorbed on the membrane surface and in the membrane pores of the sic deposited membranes due to electrostatic repulsion lin and rutledge 2018 zhang et al 2009 the slightly improved fouling resistance of the sic deposited membranes can be ascribed to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion between the membrane and oil droplets with increased sds concentration in the feed 3 5 effect of ph to determine the effect of ph on membrane fouling filtration experiments were conducted at three different ph values fig 7 we chose ph 5 6 as the starting point to study the fouling of the two membranes as it is the native ph of the fresh o w emulsion in addition this ph is commonly observed in oily wastewater wenzlick and siefert 2020 in all cases the fouling was less in the sic deposited membrane than in the al2o3 membrane in addition both membranes experienced a decrease of fouling with an increase in ph specifically the normalized initial permeance of d0 and d90 in the final filtration cycle increased from 64 to 89 and 85 to 93 when ph increased from 5 6 to 10 respectively this ph dependency can be attributed to the fact that as ph increases the surface charge of the membrane becomes more negative zhang et al 2009 as shown in fig 2a the zeta potential of the sic deposited membrane d90 decreased from 37 mv to 44 mv with an increase in ph from 5 6 to 10 respectively consequently the membrane surface was less prone to be fouled by the negatively charged oil droplets due to the stronger electrostatic repulsion however the surface charge of the al2o3 membrane was positive at a ph of 5 6 and therefore more fouling was observed as it favourably interacted with the negatively charged solutes the positively charged 8 mv surface was changed into negative 49 mv when filtering the feed with a ph of 10 and therefore electrostatic interaction became repulsive and contributed to decreased fouling abadikhah et al 2018 lee and kim 2014 although the zeta potentials of al2o3 and sic deposited membranes were similar at a ph of 10 the fouling of the sic deposited membrane was still lower than that of the al2o3 membrane this can possibly be ascribed to the stronger hydrophilic surface of the sic deposited membrane water contact angle 0 than that of the al2o3 membrane water contact angle 25 fig s6 xu et al 2020 also compared the fouling of al2o3 and sic hollow fiber membranes for mf of o w emulsions a higher flux was observed for the more hydrophilic sic membrane 3 6 effect of salinity and ca2 it has been reported that the surface charge of oil emulsions and membranes decreases with the concentration of nacl due to the compressed electrical double layer he et al 2017 tanudjaja et al 2017 although the droplet size of oil was not changed with the salinity fig s3 as shown in fig 8 the fouling of both d0 and d90 became higher when nacl concentration increased from 1 mm to 100 mm however the fouling of d90 was much lower than that of d0 when nacl concentration was lower or equal to 10 mm this indicates that the surface charge of the sic deposited membrane still had an effect on the fouling by oily wastewater with relatively low salinity whereas much more fouling was observed for both membranes when nacl concentration reached 100 mm at that salinity 100 mm nacl the flux recovery of d90 was close to that of d0 suggesting that irreversible fouling of the two membranes were similar probably because oil droplets were not easily lifted off the membrane with backwash due to charge screening and an increase of cake layer density dickhout et al 2019 he and vidic 2016 divalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 can also be present in oily wastewater their presence may accelerate membrane fouling due to more compression of the diffusion double layer compared to monovalent ions dickhout et al 2017 as shown in fig 8d the membrane fouling was worse when 1 mm ca2 was added to the emulsions and the backwashing was not effective anymore to restore the permeance therefore the irreversible fouling was considered to be the main contributor to the membrane fouling this can be explained by two effects of ca2 in the emulsion 1 lower electrostatic charge of oil droplets and membranes are to be expected due to a compressed electrostatic layer when ca2 is present in the emulsion hong and elimelech 1997 therefore droplet coalescence on the membrane surface is promoted leading to a less permeable cake layer tummons et al 2017 2 sds can interact with divalent ca2 which may cause the formation of a complex between ca2 and the sulfate group of sds panpanit et al 2000 sammalkorpi et al 2009 as a result less sds molecules exist in the emulsion as confirmed by permeate cod fig s16 leading to a higher irreversible fouling of the membranes virga et al 2020 however the irreversible fouling of d90 was still lower than that of d0 even though the electrostatic repulsion became weaker tummons et al 2017 studied the effect of mg2 on the fouling of an al2o3 uf membrane by sds stabilized emulsions the presence of mg2 6 7 mm in the emulsion was observed to promote the coalescence of oil droplets on the membrane surface leading to a higher flux decline of the membrane due to the less porosity of the cake layer when the mg2 concentration was sufficiently high 42 6 mm attached oil droplets coalesced to reach a critical size which can probably be removed by crossflow to minimize the fouling in the constant pressure filtration condition 3 7 membrane cleaning efficiency after filtration of o w emulsions at high fluxes during multiple cycles accumulation of irreversible fouling in membranes was inevitable the permeance recovery of d0 and d90 were compared after backwashing after naoh 0 01 m and after citric acid 0 01 m cleaning fig 9 the efficiency of backwashing was investigated after six cycles of filtration at a flux of 110 l m 2 h 1 as was previously shown in fig 3c the permeance recovery after backwashing of d90 64 was higher than that of d0 45 probably due to less sticky fouling in the membrane and to a more efficient backwashing after soaking the membranes in naoh 0 01 m solution at 65 c for 1 h the permeance recovery of d0 and d90 reached up to 80 and 84 respectively the permeance of d90 could be further recovered to 98 after citric acid 0 01 m 65 c treatment for 1 h while the permeance of d0 could only be recovered to 84 a high permeance recovery 100 was also observed by fraga et al 2017 when using both acid and alkaline solutions to clean sic membranes at 60 5 c after filtration of oily wastewater however the permeance recovery of d90 was lower but still higher than that of d0 after filtration of o w emulsions with either high salinity 100 mm nacl or the presence of ca2 fig s17 4 conclusion the performance of al2o3 and sic deposited ceramic membranes was systematically compared during constant flux filtration of o w emulsion with multiple filtration cycles both the operation and solution chemistry parameters affected the membrane fouling while the extents varied depending on the emulsion characteristics and operational parameters the following conclusions were drawn 1 sic deposited membranes had a lower reversible and irreversible fouling than al2o3 membranes when in multiple filtration cycles the permeate flux was smaller or equal to 100 l m 2 h 1 the fouling of both membranes was similar when the flux reached to 110 l m 2 h 1 2 increasing the concentration of sds in the feed decreased fouling of both membranes and a larger effect was observed for the al2o3 membrane the improved fouling resistance of the al2o3 membrane can be ascribed to the effect of surfactant adsorption and charge inversion while the enhanced electrostatic repulsion between the membrane and oil droplets was responsible for the lower fouling of the sic deposited membrane 3 the fouling of both al2o3 and sic deposited membranes was reduced with increased ph due to the more negative zeta potential of the membrane surface and thus a stronger electrostatic repulsion 4 the fouling of the sic deposited membrane was less with a low salinity emulsion 1 and 10 mm nacl while only a small difference in irreversible fouling was observed for al2o3 and sic deposited membranes for high salinity emulsions 100 mm nacl due to charge screening effect 5 the presence of a low concentration of ca2 1 mm in the emulsion led to high irreversible fouling for both membranes 6 the chemical cleaning efficiency of the sic deposited membrane was higher than that of the al2o3 membrane declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

16078,metals in stormwater can be toxic to organisms particularly when occurring in truly dissolved form fraction 3 kda here using 153 samples collected during six rains we investigated intra events variations of total dissolved and truly dissolved metal concentrations in highway runoff and how they were affected by a stormwater treatment train comprising a gross pollutant trap gpt and a bioretention system although intra event variations in metal concentrations were observed in the highway stormwater the effluent of the gpt and the effluent from the bioretention system generally no first flush was observed while total pb cu and zn concentrations were on average significantly reduced by the bioretention system 76 79 and 94 respectively removal of dissolved metals was lower and truly dissolved cd and cu were generally not effectively removed average removal cd 11 cu 7 7 only for truly dissolved zn was removal 65 however as with cu effluent zn concentrations exceeded environmental threshold values while cu pb and zn occurred in the highway runoff in particulate form with average percentages of 86 99 and 72 respectively the speciation of cu and zn in the bioretention effluent shifted towards greater fractions of colloidal and truly dissolved metals the gpt had no significant effect on metal concentrations and speciation graphical abstract image

posing a threat to the receiving water environment eriksson et al 2007 göbel et al 2007 levin et al 2020 stormwater bioretention systems are increasingly implemented since they can effectively reduce total metal concentrations davis et al 2003 hatt et al 2007 flanagan et al 2018 lange et al 2020b treatment efficiencies of dissolved metal fractions usually defined as 0 45 µm are more variable and

environmental protection regulations e g the eu water framework directive 2000 60 ec wfd dissolved metals including colloidal and truly dissolved fractions are increasingly measured to assess the treatment efficiency of bioretention systems determination of truly dissolved metal fractions allows a more precise assessment of the bioavailability and environmental toxicity of metals than the commonly evaluated dissolved fractions 0 45 µm markich et al 2001 lindfors et al 2021 further the speciation of metals affects removal mechanisms and pathways in bioretention systems and receiving waters and should be thus included into bioretention research gustafsson and gschwend 1997 mckenzie and young 2013 lefevre et al 2015 lange et al 2020a however truly dissolved metal fractions filtered through 3 kda filters were in a bioretention context only measured in one laboratory experiment lange et al 2020a and these results indicated a risk of less efficient treatment performances for truly dissolved metals compared to total metals despite this variability to the best of our knowledge nearly all bioretention studies have investigated dissolved and or truly dissolved metal fractions have only reported event mean concentrations emcs lange et al 2017 who investigated the variability of total and dissolved pb cu and zn over the first 25 min of three effluent events from a bioretention system showed that the total and dissolved metal concentrations were partly increased at the beginning of the events also labarre et al 2016 evaluated first flush characteristics of cu in the influent and effluent of a bioretention system treating water from a cu roof they report a first flush of total cu concentrations for 3 out of 7 storm events at the bioretention inlet and somewhat less pronounced at the outlet davis 2007 blecken et al 2009 and hatt et al 2009 who created metal pollutographs or investigated first later flush in their bioretention laboratory or in field studies showed partly significant metal concentration changes throughout bioretention outflow events but all reported only total metal concentrations for some metals increased concentrations at the beginning of inflow and outflow events were measured however without determining concentrations of dissolved and truly dissolved fractions the environmental impact of these variations cannot be understood sufficiently markich et al 2001 studies of metal intra event variations in runoff are more common than for bioretention effluent sansalone and buchberger 1997 davis 2007 nicolau et al 2012 maniquiz redillas and kim 2014 galfi et al 2017 in particular the occurrence of disproportionately high contaminant concentrations at the beginning of runoff events commonly referred to as first flush has been discussed in this context saget et al 1996 sansalone and buchberger 1997 deletic 1998 however as with bioretention research metal intra events variations in runoff have been measured so far only for total and dissolved metals sansalone and buchberger 1997 davis 2007 nicolau et al 2012 maniquiz redillas and kim 2014 galfi et al 2017 and to the best of our knowledge never for truly dissolved metals thus the stormwater data presented here are an important contribution to this topic bioretention systems are often implemented as part of a stormwater treatment train in connection with a pre sedimentation step such as a buffer strip or a gross pollutant trap gpt andersson et al 2018 fine particles were found to have settled and accumulated in pre sedimentation systems lee et al 1997 karlsson et al 2010 although such systems are not designed for the treatment of such particles this indicates that gpts could influence the concentration and speciation of metals reaching the downstream bioretention systems and thus affect their treatment performance however efficient pre treatment requires a sufficiently sized trap depending on catchment size and characteristics too small gpts will not have a significant effect on metal treatment greenway et al 2002 research into the function of gpts within treatment trains is rare and data on intra event metal variation and or truly dissolved metal treatment are lacking this study investigated variations of total dissolved and truly dissolved metal concentrations in i highway runoff and ii a two step stormwater treatment train including a gpt pre treatment step and a bioretention system besides the overall treatment performance it aimed to determine the concentrations and variations of total dissolved and truly dissolved metals in the stormwater in the effluent from the different steps within the treatment train in total six rain events were studied during which a total of 153 samples were analyzed for total dissolved and truly dissolved cadmium cd lead pb copper cu and zinc zn 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was carried out at a 2 year old stormwater bioretention system with an associated upstream gross pollutant trap gpt which treats the runoff from a catchment comprising 4 7 ha of impervious surfaces fig s1 they include 1 9 ha of a highway bridge that carried approximately 13 250 vehicles day in 2019 the system is located in cold temperate sundsvall sweden 62 23 0 5 n 17 20 50 5 e the gpt consists of a sedimentation chamber and an oil separator with a total volume of 47 m3 the stormwater from the catchment is conveyed to the gpt through a 50 m long submerged pipe when the inflow exceeds the design flow stormwater bypasses the treatment train through an overflow weir close to the gpt inlet during normal flows the water is discharged from the gpt to the filter system stepwise with a valve when the gpt is full the evaluated vegetated bioretention cell had an approximate surface area of 230 m2 the filter material itself was a 0 5 m deep layer of sand containing 10 wt caco3 as a ph buffer based on german bioretention guidelines dwa 2005 the filter materials median diameter d50 was 0 77 and the uniformity coefficient cu was 0 27 underneath the filter material a 0 3 m deep drain layer was applied and on top of it a 0 2 m gravel layer resulting in a total depth of 1 m the filter did not contain a submerged zone and was drained by the drain layer with embedded drain pipes at the bottom further details of the system can be found in lange et al 2021 2 2 experimental setup sampling and chemical analyses flow ph and contaminant concentrations were measured at six rain events a f between september and december 2020 given the northern latitude of sundsvall the events were sampled in autumn winter prior to the last event event f deicing salt had been applied on the highway by the road operator samples were collected from three points in the system stormwater inflow i e the highway runoff entering the gpt labeled as sw the gpt outflow i e the inflow to the bioretention system labeled as gpt the bioretention outflow labeled as f1 the rain characteristics of the studied events table s1 were determined using a tipping bucket rain gage isco 674 installed next to the treatment train for rain event c data were used from a weather station 0 2 km away due to technical problems with the isco rain gage for the flow measurements at the inflow and outflow of the gpt an ultrasound flow meter pcm 4 nivus gmbh eppingen germany was used the outflow from the bioretention system was measured with an in pipe electromagnetic flow meter mag 5100 siemens ag münchen germany inflow and outflow characteristics are summarized in table s2 and figs s2 s3 all water samples were collected volume proportionally using three automatic samplers isco6712 each equipped with 24 plastic bottles prior to the experiment these were acid washed in total 153 samples were collected during six rains it would have been preferable to take samples from more than six rain events however other investigations of intra event variations in stormwater have commonly included even fewer rain events five events sansalone and buchberger 1997 three events peter et al 2020 galfi et al 2016 2017 further details on the sampling procedure are provided in the supplementary information section s1 all samples were analyzed for total dissolved and truly dissolved cd pb cu and zn in each sample the total organic carbon toc dissolved organic carbon doc total suspended solids tss chloride cl and ph were determined for obtaining the dissolved and truly dissolved fractions subsamples were filtered using sterile pes membrane syringe units filtropur s pore size 0 45 µm filter surface 5 3 cm2 sarstedt ag co kg nürmbrecht germany and ultracel regenerated cellulose membrane units with a 3 kda cutoff amicon ultra 15 centrifugal filter unit merck kgaa darmstadt germany respectively the centrifugation was carried out in field using centrifuge 5804 with swing out rotor eppendorf se hamburg germany for the 3 kda filtration the membrane units had been pre cleaned with naoh and deionized water and were centrifuged for 90 min swinging bucket 4200 rpm all filtration steps were carried out in field directly after sample collection as described in more detail by lange et al 2020a size fractionation is a relatively cheap and easy approach to estimate particulate colloidal and truly dissolved fractions gustafsson and gschwend 1997 metal cl toc doc and ph analyses were conducted according to standard methods as described in the supplementary information section s2 for quality assurance and quality control a blank sample was analyzed at each sampling event metal analyses were carried out by a laboratory accredited by the swedish board for accreditation and conformity assessment swedac that follows international qa standards and uses laboratory blanks and controls for quality insurance quality control 2 3 data analyses the particulate fraction was calculated by subtracting dissolved metal concentrations 0 45 µm from total metal concentrations the colloidal fractions were calculated by subtracting the truly dissolved metal concentrations 3 kda from dissolved metal concentrations 0 45 µm for further details see lange et al 2020a mean concentrations were calculated for the contaminants at the inflow and the outflow of the gpt for f1 mean contaminant concentrations were calculated for rain events e and f and partial mean concentrations for the remaining rainfall since the sampling did not capture the whole outflow event table s2 to compare the overall treatment of the whole treatment train and the single treatment

and discussion 3 1 stormwater total dissolved and truly dissolved metal concentrations of the stormwater runoff varied during the rain events no clear first flush as defined by saget et al 1996 was observed highway runoff was generally polluted with metals fig 1 in ranges previously determined for stormwater e g göbel et al 2007 cu pb and zn frequently occurred in particulate form in the highway runoff of the dissolved metals most were found in the truly dissolved form instead of the colloidal form 3 1 1 intra event variations in the highway runoff intra event variations were displayed as metal concentration cumulative discharge volume graphs and cumulative metal load cumulative discharge volume graphs as described by saget et al 1996 whose first flush definition was used transport of 80 of the pollution load in the first 30 of the runoff total metal concentrations often fluctuated during the rain events without clear rising or falling trends figs 2 3 s10 s14 metal concentration peaks occurred in all phases of the inflow event generally cumulative pollutant loads and cumulative runoff volumes increased relatively proportionally for total pb cu and zn with only small to moderate deviations in the data points from the horizontal line through the cumulative load cumulative runoff diagrams figs 4 5 for total pb cu and zn approximately 15 40 of the load were transported within the first 30 of the runoff conclusions about the intra event variability of cd are not possible because the concentrations of total cd at the inflow in 25 of 49 samples were below the loq for dissolved and truly dissolved metals metal peak concentrations occurred more often at the beginning of a rain compared to the total metals figs 2 3 and s10 s14 but as for total metals the cumulative load cumulative runoff diagrams figs 4 5 and s5 s9 indicate that dissolved and truly dissolved metals were transported in the stormwater in all phases of a rain event i e a first flush according to the definition of saget et al 1996 was not observed however compared to total metals during some rain events more pronounced deviations above and below the diagonal 1 1 line in the cumulative load cumulative runoff diagrams were observed for dissolved and truly dissolved metals the load runoff curves of cd cu and zn do not differ between dissolved and truly dissolved metals and depending on the specific metal and rain event 3 60 of the pollutant load was transported with the first 30 of the runoff for dissolved and truly dissolved cu and dissolved pb 30 to 55 60 of the pollutant load was transported with the first 30 of the rain while for dissolved and truly dissolved cd as well as dissolved and truly dissolved zn this range was wider at approximately 15 55 and 3 40 respectively for total cd and truly dissolved pb the cumulative load cumulative runoff curves could not be evaluated as in 25 and 35 samples out of 49 respectively the concentrations were below the loq 3 1 2 concentrations of total dissolved and truly dissolved metals the mean total metal concentrations in the runoff from the highway were for cd 0 079 0 04 µg l for pb 5 4 4 2 µg l for cu 36 21 µg l and for zn 288 126 µg l table s3 fig 1 the mean metal concentrations for dissolved metals 0 45 µm in the highway runoff were for cd 0 015 0 015 µg l for pb 0 057 0 037 µg l for cu 5 2 1 8 µg l and for zn 81 50 µg l the mean metal concentrations for truly dissolved metals 3 kda in the highway runoff were for cd 0 013 0 017 µg l pb 0 012 0 0057 µg l cu 2 5 1 1 µg l and zn 68 40 µg l one interesting observation was that during rain event f where the highest concentration of cl was measured in the road runoff 284 3010 mg l the peak concentrations of total dissolved and truly dissolved cd total pb as well as total zn were higher than during the rain events a e cl concentration 1 101 mg l figs 6 s10 s14 however data from six rain events are not sufficient to investigate correlations between environmental conditions and metal concentrations in stormwater which was outside the scope of this study 3 1 3 the metal speciation pb was present in this study on average to 99 in particulate form table s4 also cu and zn were present in the inflow often in particulate form with average percentages for cu of 86 and for zn of 72 fig s4 table s4 despite the high average percentage of particulate zn it must be noted that speciation of zn varied depending on the rain event as indicated in fig 3 during rain events a b and c considerably more zn is in the dissolved and truly dissolved fraction compared to events d e and f the proportion of particulate cd cannot be determined with certainty as many values were below the loq for cd and zn most of the dissolved metals were truly dissolved cd 90 zn 84 which results in only small colloidal fractions of these metals at the inflow to the treatment train for cu colloidal and truly dissolved fraction percentages were on average equal 7 3 1 4 discussion despite the observed variations in the metal concentrations during the rain events the first flush phenomenon defined by saget et al 1996 as the transport of 80 of the pollution load in the first 30 of the runoff event was not observed in this study for total dissolved and truly dissolved metals in the runoff from the highway figs 4 5 and s5 s9 the variations in total metals in the highway runoff may be linked to the variations of tss fig s14 as has been shown in previous studies galfi et al 2017 in this study spearman s correlation indicated strong correlations between total metal concentrations and tss concentration spearman s rho pb 0 950 p 0 000 cu 0 818 p 0 000 zn 0 836 p 0 000 cd n d which is not surprising since metals occurred in this study often predominantly in the particulate form although previous work documented partly increased total metal and or tss concentrations in the early phase of runoff events sansalone and buchberger 1997 davis 2007 nicolau et al 2012 maniquiz redillas and kim 2014 galfi et al 2017 earlier studies of inter event variations in stormwater using first flush criteria as in this study confirmed that the first flush phenomenon is rarely found for tss in storm runoff saget et al 1996 deletic and maksimovic 1998 although only six rain events were collected in this study our data is in line with previous findings by deletic 1998 who identified rain intensity and flow characteristic as most relevant factors affecting the transport and potential first flush of tss and particulate metals in this study the most pronounced deviation above the 1 1 diagonal in the cumulative load cumulative runoff diagram from tss fig s9 was observed for event b the event with the highest maximum rain intensity and the highest cumulative runoff volume table s2 although this study found no first flush of dissolved and truly dissolved cd cu and zn in the highway runoff elevated concentrations of dissolved and truly dissolved metals at the beginning of the runoff events were observed this supports the findings of sansalone and buchberger 1997 who studied stormwater sheet flow over urban pavements and found that the normalized transported mass of dissolved 0 45 µm cd cu and zn over time was mostly greater or equal to the normalized flow volume over time but not the normalized transported mass of dissolved pb also nicolau et al 2012 who studied total and dissolved metal concentration in an urban creek affected by stormwater inflow found that dissolved cu and zn concentrations and in some cases dissolved pb concentrations were elevated at the beginning of a stormwater flow event the decreases in concentrations of dissolved and truly dissolved metals over the course of a runoff event in this study can probably be attributed to dilution effects through the rainwater as observed previously by nicolau et al 2012 total dissolved and truly dissolved metal concentrations determined in the stormwater fig 1 are within the range of metal concentrations determined in a study of urban runoff quality by lindfors et al 2020 who used a similar size fractionation approach as in this study and thus were able to report results for total dissolved and truly dissolved in this case defined as 3000 molecular weight cut off mwco metals furthermore total metal concentrations are generally in the range determined by göbel et al 2007 for dense traffic areas only total cu concentration was lower than expected and correspond rather to low trafficked areas göbel et al 2007 reasons for elevated metal concentrations in stormwater during rain event f compared to the other rain events might be ion exchange and complexation processes as well as effects on particle stability induced by na and cl ions behbahani et al 2021 the elevated metal concentrations during rain event f in this study might be explained by dissolution from road dust or previously accumulated sediment in the stormwater pipes the results for metal speciation in this study are in line with earlier studies of metal speciation in stormwater it is common to find pb occurring in stormwater mainly in the particulate form tuccillo 2006 mckenzie and young 2013 flanagan et al 2018 also high particulate fractions of cu and zn have been previously observed in stormwater flanagan et al 2018 lindfors et al 2020 however ratios of particulate and dissolved cu and zn in stormwater can generally be variable depending on the catchment and the rain characteristics morrison et al 1990 sansalone and buchberger 1997 tuccillo 2006 maniquiz redillas and kim 2014 huber et al 2016 the relatively high ratios of particulate zn during events d e and f fig 3 may partly be explained with the higher ph during these events fig s14 which may have increased the adsorption of metals to organic matter and mineral particles in stormwater bradl 2004 pb and cu speciation was less affected by ph probably due to their higher affinity to complex with organic matter and mineral particles at lower ph compared to zn bradl 2004 the reason for the higher ph at events d e and f was likely due to an accident of a concrete mixing truck in the catchment during which the concrete load was partly released on the highway some previous studies subdivided the dissolved phase further to measure colloidal and truly dissolved metal fractions morrison et al 1990 tuccillo 2006 lindfors et al 2020 however only a few used a similar size fractionation approach as in this study lindfors et al 2020 used 0 45 µm and 3 kda filters to determine colloidal and truly dissolved metal fractions and as in this study they found small colloidal cu and zn fractions in runoff from urban catchments this has also been shown earlier by tuccillo 2006 who used 0 45 µm and 10 kda filters to determine colloidal and truly dissolved metal fractions in stormwater from suburban catchments 3 2 gpt outflow despite most of the cu pb and zn being mainly in particulate form in the highway runoff the gpt did not reduce metal concentrations nor had any significant effects on metal speciation fig 1 tables 1 s4 also the variations within the flow event were generally similar to the variations in the highway runoff fig s5 s14 a detailed description of the water quality in the gpt outflow and a discussion of the gpt function is provided in the supplementary information section s3 3 3 bioretention outflow in the effluent of the bioretention system metal concentrations were variable although peak concentrations often occurred during the first 100 m3 of discharge first flush events according to the definition of saget et al 1996 could not be observed generally reductions in total metal concentrations were statistically significant after passage through the bioretention system whereas dissolved and specifically truly dissolved metal concentrations were in some cases not reduced statistically significantly by the bioretention system similarly the speciation of cu and zn in bioretention effluent shifted towards stronger fractions of colloidal and truly dissolved metals 3 3 1 intra event variations in the effluent of the bioretention system total dissolved and truly dissolved metal concentrations generally varied throughout the bioretention outflow events for rain events a to d partial outflow events figs 2 3 and s10 s14 in contrast to the highway runoff and the gpt effluent concentration peaks of total dissolved and truly dissolved metals either occurred at the beginning of the effluent events within the first 100 m3 of the effluent or concentrations appeared relatively stable throughout the outflow event given a pore volume of the filter of only ca 60 m3 a well drained filter material i e no standing water and or continuing outflow prior to the rain and the lack of a submerged zone the majority of that water was newly treated water originating from that rain event at events b c and e being events with higher cumulative runoff a stabilization of total dissolved and truly dissolved metal concentrations was observed although the cumulative load cumulative outflow curves do not cover the whole outflow event for all rain events they reveal that deviations below the diagonal are less common in the effluent from the bioretention system compared to the highway stormwater and the outflow of the gpt figs 4 5 and s5 s9 for rain events e and f where approximately 90 of the rain event was covered small deviations from the diagonal in the cumulative load cumulative outflow curves indicate that the pollutant loads were discharged relatively evenly over the course of the outflow event after 30 of the total effluent from storms e and f had left the bioretention system approximately 30 40 of total dissolved and truly dissolved cu and zn and truly dissolved cd and dissolved pb load were discharged from the bioretention system for total pb and total cd effluent concentrations were mostly below loq generally for rain events e and f the difference between the cumulative load cumulative outflow curves of total and dissolved as well as truly dissolved metals is not as distinct as in the stormwater for rain events b c and d only the first 50 60 of the rain events could be covered in the sampling campaign however cumulative load cumulative outflow curves indicate that at least during the first 50 60 of the runoff the curves for total dissolved and truly dissolved metals are very similar for the respective metal i e distinctly different courses of cumulative load cumulative outflow curves between total and dissolved truly dissolved metals as observed in the stormwater and the gross pollutant trap do not mostly exist in the outflow for total dissolved and truly dissolved zn and cu at rain event b the deviations above the diagonal were generally larger than for events c and d figs 4 5 and s7 8 indicating that for this event a more pronounced initial concentration drop in the initial effluent occurred at event a only the first 30 of the outflow event was covered by the sampling campaign making the interpretation of these data regarding the intra event variations difficult 3 3 2 the concentrations of total dissolved and truly dissolved metals after passage through the bioretention system total and dissolved metal concentrations were mostly statistically significantly lower than in the highway runoff or the effluent of the gpt fig 1 table s3 only the concentration of dissolved cd was not statistically significantly reduced by the bioretention system treatment performance for total cd could not be statistically evaluated since also inflow concentrations were often below loq however fig s10 indicates efficient removal when stormwater concentrations were above the loq along with the significant concentration reductions for total and most dissolved metals removal of dissolved metals was for dissolved cu 18 and zn 67 on average lower than for total cu 79 and zn 94 table 1 removal of dissolved cd was very variable between the rain events with a mean removal of 8 also for dissolved pb leaching was observed 16 however this is probably because the fraction of dissolved pb was small truly dissolved metals were mostly not significantly reduced by the bioretention system truly dissolved metal removal cd 11 cu 7 7 fig 1 tables 1 s3 with the exception of truly dissolved zn which was significantly reduced mean removal 65 table 1 furthermore the concentration volume graphs show that the zn total dissolved truly dissolved and cd dissolved truly dissolved concentrations in event f were higher than during the other rain events the tss concentrations in the effluent of the bioretention system were always low partly loq fig 1 thus conclusions about correlations between tss and metal concentrations cannot be drawn for the effluent 3 3 3 speciation cu and zn speciation in the outflow of the bioretention system changed compared to the speciation in the stormwater and the outflow of the gpt table s4 and fig s4 on average for cu the ratio of the colloidal fraction increased from 7 sw gpt to 32 at the outflow of the bioretention system the ratio of the truly dissolved fraction increased from 7 t 8 sw or gpt respectively to 43 at the outflow of the bioretention system for zn the truly dissolved fraction increased from 23 to 22 sw and gpt respectively to 63 while the ratio of the colloidal fraction was 5 in the stormwater 4 after the gpt and 7 at the outflow of the bioretention system at the outflow pb and cd were often below the loq and thus speciation could not be determined the data suggest however that most of the dissolved cd in the outflow was truly dissolved 3 3 4 discussion as seen with the highway runoff for the effluent of the bioretention system there was no first flush observed for total dissolved and truly dissolved metals but metal concentrations peaked often but not always at the beginning of the effluent events the same pattern of variations in metal concentrations in the bioretention effluent have been observed previously for total and dissolved metals in the field davis 2007 hatt et al 2009 lange et al 2017 and a laboratory study blecken et al 2009 blecken et al 2009 carried out a pilot scale laboratory experiment where they found significantly higher total pb cu and zn concentrations in the initial outflow of bioretention columns the studies by davis 2007 hatt et al 2009 and lange et al 2017 only corroborate this for single events i e no general first flush phenomenon was detected in the bioretention outflow in their studies labarre et al 2016 report a first flush for total cu for 3 out of 7 rain events in the effluent of a pilot scale bioretention system treating roof runoff from two 1 5 3 m cu roof sections when initial metal concentrations peaks occur this might be explained by mobilization of metals captured in the filter material due to oxidation processes in the top layer of the filter material during dry conditions dilution of metals into porewater of the filter material during the period between rain events and processes at the wetting front created at the beginning of a rain event bartlett and james 1980 blecken et al 2009 hatt et al 2009 subramaniam et al 2015 further as earlier shown for stormwater by deletic 1998 the factors flow volume and flow intensity may play a role for the occurrence of first flush in the effluent the highest deviations above the 1 1 line in the cumulative load runoff graphs fig s5 s9 were observed for event b which had the highest peak flow 10 l s and flow volume 590 m3 of all rains however for a more detailed evaluation data from further storm events would have been needed table s2 generally total metals are efficiently treated in bioretention systems with removal percentages of greater than 67 davis 2007 blecken et al 2009 hatt et al 2009 feng et al 2012 by filtration processes in the top layer of the bioretention system lefevre et al 2015 al ameri et al 2018 less effective treatment of dissolved metals was observed in earlier bioretention studies maniquiz redillas and kim 2014 søberg et al 2017 lange et al 2020b the underlying main treatment processes for dissolved metals in bioretention systems are diverse sorption processes where organic matter content of the filter media design of the system including vegetation selection stormwater composition and environmental conditions all play an important role and explain a higher variability of treatment efficiency paus et al 2014 lefevre et al 2015 søberg et al 2017 lange et al 2020b the leaching or limited removal of truly dissolved cd pb and cu in this study was different to the results of the only laboratory column study on truly dissolved metal treatment in bioretention systems to date by lange et al 2020a where considerable removals 80 were observed for truly dissolved cd cu and zn the reasons for these high reductions could be that there was more organic matter om in the filter material of the laboratory columns 14 3 g om kg dry mass dm than in the field bioretention system in this study 3 2 g om kg dm specifically cu has a high affinity for the sorption to om bradl 2004 a positive effect of increased om content was shown by for example paus et al 2014 further the columns in the study by lange et al 2020a experienced constant environmental conditions e g no dry periods which could lead to mobilization of metals as shown by among others by lange et al 2020b besides the positive effects on metal treatment metal sorption to om also carries the risk of metal leaching complexed with doc blecken et al 2009 lefevre et al 2015 in the effluent of the bioretention system in this study total dissolved and truly dissolved cu concentrations were correlated with concentrations of doc spearman rho total cu 0 475 p 0 000 dissolved cu 0 645 p 0 000 truly dissolved cu 0 559 p 0 000 this was also shown previously in a column study with non vegetated systems by chahal et al 2016 and indicated in a batch experiment by charbonnet et al 2020 the fact that also truly dissolved cu is correlated with doc indicates that high quantities of the truly dissolved cu fraction may still be complexed to small organic compounds and thus potentially less toxic compared to free cu ions alloway 2013 in our study dissolved and truly dissolved zn were treated more effectively compared to the other metals table 1 this is likely caused by the lower affinity of zn to om compared to cu and also pb and cd bradl 2004 gülbaz et al 2015 alloway 2013 the correlation between doc concentrations and dissolved zn concentrations was only weak spearman rho dissolved zn 0 272 p 0 049 and for truly dissolved zn not significant spearman rho truly dissolved zn 0 221 p 0 112 thus other factors than doc determine the zn treatment in the bioretention system as previously been shown in an experiment with vegetated columns by zhao et al 2007 generally it can be assumed that the conditions in the bioretention filter material mixed with caco3 favor metal sorption since caco3 addition alters the soil chemistry by increasing the soil ph alloway 2013 at higher ph an increased amount of charged metal binding sites are available in the soil and metal sorption is facilitated bradl 2004 a positive effect of the caco3 addition on dissolved zn removal was shown by fahlbeck carlsson 2021 who compared total and dissolved metal treatment in the bioretention cell with caco3 that is the subject of our study f1 with the metal treatment in the parallel bioretention cell where no caco3 was added the increased metal concentrations during event f were probably due to the increased cl concentration 860 1400 mg l due to application of road salt and can be explained by ion exchange processes complexation processes and effects on particle stability bäckström et al 2004 søberg et al 2017 behbahani et al 2021 the effective removal of particulate metals and less effective removal of dissolved and truly dissolved metals causes the speciation shift between inflow and outflow metal fraction ratios søberg et al 2017 as observed for cu and zn in this study to date there is only one other bioretention study where particulate colloidal and truly dissolved fractions were determined in a laboratory column experiment lange et al 2020a reported in their bioretention study an increase in the colloidal and truly dissolved fractions of cu and zn after water passed through bioretention columns for effluent cu and zn they reported larger colloidal fractions 41 50 and 13 23 that might be attributed in the case of cu to the organic matter content of filter media and doc concentrations in the effluent e g chahal et al 2016 however the doc concentrations in the effluent of their study were not determined 3 4 overall performance of the treatment train the overall treatment within the treatment train was effective for total metals with removal percentages of 76 for total pb 81 for total cu and 94 for total zn table 1 for dissolved metals treatment was less effective for pb cu and zn with mean removal percentages of 6 6 22 and 77 respectively dissolved cd removal was 30 the removal of truly dissolved metals was even lower with 19 for cd and 5 7 for cu only truly dissolved zn was as equally well removed as dissolved zn 76 the metal treatment mainly occurred in the bioretention system and not in the gpt while pb cu and zn occurred often as particulate metals at the inflow of the treatment train in the effluent only pb was mainly particulate while cu and zn occurred as colloidal or truly dissolved metals table s4 in the inflow the colloidal fraction was generally small and dissolved cd cu and zn were mainly in truly dissolved form in the effluent colloidal zn and cu fractions increased the speciation change is likely responsible for the decrease in total metal intra event variations from influent to effluent of the treatment train in the inflow total metal concentrations were commonly very variable throughout the events while dissolved and truly dissolved fractions decreased or were stable over time in the outflow where most metals were in dissolved or truly dissolved form generally decreasing or stable concentrations were observed 3 5 environmental impact and practical implications despite efficient treatment of total metals the bioretention system could only partly reduce the adverse impact of stormwater on the receiving water total metal concentrations as well as dissolved pb and cd concentrations partly exceeded swedish environmental threshold values for receiving waterbodies or stormwater discharge riktvärdesgruppen 2009 swam 2016 swam 2019 figs s10 s14 in the runoff and the effluent of the gpt but not in the effluent of the bioretention system however dissolved and truly dissolved zn and cu mean concentrations exceeded swedish environmental threshold values for receiving waterbodies 2 4 and 7 µg l for dissolved cu and zn in lakes swam 2016 0 5 and 5 5 µg l for bioavailable cu and zn riktvärdesgruppen 2009 figs 2 3 not only in the runoff and the effluent of the gpt but also in the effluent from the bioretention system and that even though the treatment of dissolved zn in the treatment train was efficient 77 that threshold values of dissolved but specifically of truly dissolved metals are exceeded in the effluent from the bioretention system is particularly critical since the truly dissolved fraction may indicate the relative magnitude of the bioavailable fraction and thus the environmental toxicity of cu and zn markich et al 2001 lindfors et al 2021 this shows that if only total metal concentrations would have been measured potentially toxic events that would be in violation of dissolved metals regulations e g swam 2016 swam 2019 could been overseen further studies should thus include dissolved metal fractions despite initial metal concentrations peaks the intra event variations of zn and cu concentrations did not show a clear first flush this is in line with the results by saget et al 1996 who report that a first flush is very scarce even if one would apply a less strict first flush definition than they did in view of potential mitigation strategies this emphasizes that it would not be sufficient to threat only the first fraction of the bioretention effluent as concluded in earlier studies on treatment of runoff saget et al 1996 deletic and maksimovic 1998 huber et al 2016 4 conclusions intra events variations of total dissolved and truly dissolved metal concentrations in highway runoff and treatment in a stormwater treatment train comprising a gpt and a bioretention system were investigated using 153 samples collected during six rains intra event variations in metal concentrations were observed in the runoff and the effluent of the treatment steps generally no first flush was observed while total metals were removed efficiently by the bioretention system removal of dissolved metals was lower while truly dissolved cd and cu were generally not effectively removed average removal cd 11 cu 7 7 the mean removal of truly dissolved zn was 65 still truly dissolved cu and zn concentrations in the effluent exceeded environmental threshold values which emphasizes how important it is to not only measure total metal removal when evaluating bioretention treatment efficiency this is also underlined by the metal speciation change within the bioretention system while the metals occurred in the highway runoff mainly in particulate form the speciation of cu and zn in the bioretention effluent shifted towards greater fractions of colloidal and truly dissolved metals the gpt had no significant effect on metal concentrations and speciation future research should therefore focus on optimizing bioretention systems for the treatment of dissolved and truly dissolved metals and on the development of better pre treatment facilities further to understand inter event variations of total dissolved and truly dissolved metals better more field experiments should be carried out generating more data on

16078,metals in stormwater can be toxic to organisms particularly when occurring in truly dissolved form fraction 3 kda here using 153 samples collected during six rains we investigated intra events variations of total dissolved and truly dissolved metal concentrations in highway runoff and how they were affected by a stormwater treatment train comprising a gross pollutant trap gpt and a bioretention system although intra event variations in metal concentrations were observed in the highway stormwater the effluent of the gpt and the effluent from the bioretention system generally no first flush was observed while total pb cu and zn concentrations were on average significantly reduced by the bioretention system 76 79 and 94 respectively removal of dissolved metals was lower and truly dissolved cd and cu were generally not effectively removed average removal cd 11 cu 7 7 only for truly dissolved zn was removal 65 however as with cu effluent zn concentrations exceeded environmental threshold values while cu pb and zn occurred in the highway runoff in particulate form with average percentages of 86 99 and 72 respectively the speciation of cu and zn in the bioretention effluent shifted towards greater fractions of colloidal and truly dissolved metals the gpt had no significant effect on metal concentrations and speciation graphical abstract image

posing a threat to the receiving water environment eriksson et al 2007 göbel et al 2007 levin et al 2020 stormwater bioretention systems are increasingly implemented since they can effectively reduce total metal concentrations davis et al 2003 hatt et al 2007 flanagan et al 2018 lange et al 2020b treatment efficiencies of dissolved metal fractions usually defined as 0 45 µm are more variable and even leaching can occur e g due to road salt application after extended drying and due to biofilter design maniquiz redillas and kim 2014 søberg et al 2017 lange et al 2020a 2020b as a result of environmental protection regulations e g the eu water framework directive 2000 60 ec wfd dissolved metals including colloidal and truly dissolved fractions are increasingly measured to assess the treatment efficiency of bioretention systems determination of truly dissolved metal fractions allows a more precise assessment of the bioavailability and environmental toxicity of metals than the commonly evaluated dissolved fractions 0 45 µm markich et al 2001 lindfors et al 2021 further the speciation of metals affects removal mechanisms and pathways in bioretention systems and receiving waters and should be thus included into bioretention research gustafsson and gschwend 1997 mckenzie and young 2013 lefevre et al 2015 lange et al 2020a however truly dissolved metal fractions filtered through 3 kda filters were in a bioretention context only measured in one laboratory experiment lange et al 2020a and these results indicated a risk of less efficient treatment performances for truly dissolved metals compared to total metals despite this variability to the best of our knowledge nearly all bioretention studies have investigated dissolved and or truly dissolved metal fractions have only reported event mean concentrations emcs lange et al 2017 who investigated the variability of total and dissolved pb cu and zn over the first 25 min of three effluent events from a bioretention system showed that the total and dissolved metal concentrations were partly increased at the beginning of the events also labarre et al 2016 evaluated first flush characteristics of cu in the influent and effluent of a bioretention system treating water from a cu roof they report a first flush of total cu concentrations for 3 out of 7 storm events at the bioretention inlet and somewhat less pronounced at the outlet davis 2007 blecken et al 2009 and hatt et al 2009 who created metal pollutographs or investigated first later flush in their bioretention laboratory or in field studies showed partly significant metal concentration changes throughout bioretention outflow events but all reported only total metal concentrations for some metals increased concentrations at the beginning of inflow and outflow events were measured however without determining concentrations of dissolved and truly dissolved fractions the environmental impact of these variations cannot be understood sufficiently markich et al 2001 studies of metal intra event variations in runoff are more common than for bioretention effluent sansalone and buchberger 1997 davis 2007 nicolau et al 2012 maniquiz redillas and kim 2014 galfi et al 2017 in particular the occurrence of disproportionately high contaminant concentrations at the beginning of runoff events commonly referred to as first flush has been discussed in this context saget et al 1996 sansalone and buchberger 1997 deletic 1998 however as with bioretention research metal intra events variations in runoff have been measured so far only for total and dissolved metals sansalone and buchberger 1997 davis 2007 nicolau et al 2012 maniquiz redillas and kim 2014 galfi et al 2017 and to the best of our knowledge never for truly dissolved metals thus the stormwater data presented here are an important contribution to this topic bioretention systems are often implemented as part of a stormwater treatment train in connection with a pre sedimentation step such as a buffer strip or a gross pollutant trap gpt andersson et al 2018 fine particles were found to have settled and accumulated in pre sedimentation systems lee et al 1997 karlsson et al 2010 although such systems are not designed for the treatment of such particles this indicates that gpts could influence the concentration and speciation of metals reaching the downstream bioretention systems and thus affect their treatment performance however efficient pre treatment requires a sufficiently sized trap depending on catchment size and characteristics too small gpts will not have a significant effect on metal treatment greenway et al 2002 research into the function of gpts within treatment trains is rare and data on intra event metal variation and or truly dissolved metal treatment are lacking this study investigated variations of total dissolved and truly dissolved metal concentrations in i highway runoff and ii a two step stormwater treatment train including a gpt pre treatment step and a bioretention system besides the overall treatment performance it aimed to determine the concentrations and variations of total dissolved and truly dissolved metals in the stormwater in the effluent from the different steps within the treatment train in total six rain events were studied during which a total of 153 samples were analyzed for total dissolved and truly dissolved cadmium cd lead pb copper cu and zinc zn 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was carried out at a 2 year old stormwater bioretention system with an associated upstream gross pollutant trap gpt which treats the runoff from a catchment comprising 4 7 ha of impervious surfaces fig s1 they include 1 9 ha of a highway bridge that carried approximately 13 250 vehicles day in 2019 the system is located in cold temperate sundsvall sweden 62 23 0 5 n 17 20 50 5 e the gpt consists of a sedimentation chamber and an oil separator with a total volume of 47 m3 the stormwater from the catchment is conveyed to the gpt through a 50 m long submerged pipe when the inflow exceeds the design flow stormwater bypasses the treatment train through an overflow weir close to the gpt inlet during normal flows the water is discharged from the gpt to the filter system stepwise with a valve when the gpt is full the evaluated vegetated bioretention cell had an approximate surface area of 230 m2 the filter material itself was a 0 5 m deep layer of sand containing 10 wt caco3 as a ph buffer based on german bioretention guidelines dwa 2005 the filter materials median diameter d50 was 0 77 and the uniformity coefficient cu was 0 27 underneath the filter material a 0 3 m deep drain layer was applied and on top of it a 0 2 m gravel layer resulting in a total depth of 1 m the filter did not contain a submerged zone and was drained by the drain layer with embedded drain pipes at the bottom further details of the system can be found in lange et al 2021 2 2 experimental setup sampling and chemical analyses flow ph and contaminant concentrations were measured at six rain events a f between september and december 2020 given the northern latitude of sundsvall the events were sampled in autumn winter prior to the last event event f deicing salt had been applied on the highway by the road operator samples were collected from three points in the system stormwater inflow i e the highway runoff entering the gpt labeled as sw the gpt outflow i e the inflow to the bioretention system labeled as gpt the bioretention outflow labeled as f1 the rain characteristics of the studied events table s1 were determined using a tipping bucket rain gage isco 674 installed next to the treatment train for rain event c data were used from a weather station 0 2 km away due to technical problems with the isco rain gage for the flow measurements at the inflow and outflow of the gpt an ultrasound flow meter pcm 4 nivus gmbh eppingen germany was used the outflow from the bioretention system was measured with an in pipe electromagnetic flow meter mag 5100 siemens ag münchen germany inflow and outflow characteristics are summarized in table s2 and figs s2 s3 all water samples were collected volume proportionally using three automatic samplers isco6712 each equipped with 24 plastic bottles prior to the experiment these were acid washed in total 153 samples were collected during six rains it would have been preferable to take samples from more than six rain events however other investigations of intra event variations in stormwater have commonly included even fewer rain events five events sansalone and buchberger 1997 three events peter et al 2020 galfi et al 2016 2017 further details on the sampling procedure are provided in the supplementary information section s1 all samples were analyzed for total dissolved and truly dissolved cd pb cu and zn in each sample the total organic carbon toc dissolved organic carbon doc total suspended solids tss chloride cl and ph were determined for obtaining the dissolved and truly dissolved fractions subsamples were filtered using sterile pes membrane syringe units filtropur s pore

darmstadt germany respectively the centrifugation was carried out in field using centrifuge 5804 with swing out rotor eppendorf se hamburg germany for the 3 kda filtration the membrane units had been pre cleaned with naoh and deionized water and were centrifuged for 90 min swinging bucket 4200 rpm all filtration steps were carried out in field directly after sample collection as described in more detail by lange et al 2020a size fractionation is a relatively cheap and easy approach to estimate particulate colloidal and truly dissolved fractions gustafsson and gschwend 1997 metal cl toc doc and ph analyses were conducted according to standard methods as described in the supplementary information section s2 for quality assurance and quality control a blank sample was analyzed at each sampling event metal analyses were carried out by a laboratory accredited by the swedish board for accreditation and conformity assessment swedac that follows international qa standards and uses laboratory blanks and controls for quality insurance quality control 2 3 data analyses the particulate fraction was calculated by subtracting dissolved metal concentrations 0 45 µm from total metal concentrations the colloidal fractions were calculated by subtracting the truly dissolved metal concentrations 3 kda from dissolved metal concentrations 0 45 µm for further details see lange et al 2020a mean concentrations were calculated for the contaminants at the inflow and the outflow of the gpt for f1 mean contaminant concentrations were calculated for rain events e and f and partial mean concentrations for the remaining rainfall since the sampling did not capture the whole outflow event table s2 to compare the overall treatment of the whole treatment train and the single treatment

and discussion 3 1 stormwater total dissolved and truly dissolved metal concentrations of the stormwater runoff varied during the rain events no clear first flush as defined by saget et al 1996 was observed highway runoff was generally polluted with metals fig 1 in ranges previously determined for stormwater e g göbel et al 2007 cu pb and zn frequently occurred in particulate form in the highway runoff of the dissolved metals most were found in the truly dissolved form instead of the colloidal form 3 1 1 intra event variations in the highway runoff intra event variations were displayed as metal concentration cumulative discharge volume graphs and cumulative metal load cumulative discharge volume graphs as described by saget et al 1996 whose first flush definition was used transport of 80 of the pollution load in the first 30 of the runoff total metal concentrations often fluctuated during the rain events without clear rising or falling trends figs 2 3 s10 s14 metal concentration peaks occurred in all phases of the inflow event generally cumulative pollutant loads and cumulative runoff volumes increased relatively proportionally for total pb cu and zn with only small to moderate deviations in the data points from the horizontal line through the cumulative load cumulative runoff diagrams figs 4 5 for total pb cu and zn approximately 15 40 of the load were transported within the first 30 of the runoff conclusions about the intra event variability of cd are not possible because the concentrations of total cd at the inflow in 25 of 49 samples were below the loq for dissolved and truly dissolved metals metal peak concentrations occurred more often at the beginning of a rain compared to the total metals figs 2 3 and s10 s14 but as for total metals the cumulative load cumulative runoff diagrams figs 4 5 and s5 s9 indicate that dissolved and truly dissolved metals were transported in the stormwater in all phases of a rain event i e a first flush according to the definition of saget et al 1996 was not observed however compared to total metals during some rain events more pronounced deviations above and below the diagonal 1 1 line in the cumulative load cumulative runoff diagrams were observed for dissolved and truly dissolved metals the load runoff curves of cd cu and zn do not differ between dissolved and truly dissolved metals and depending on the specific metal and rain event 3 60 of the pollutant load was transported with the first 30 of the runoff for dissolved and truly dissolved cu and dissolved pb 30 to 55 60 of the pollutant load was transported with the first 30 of the rain while for dissolved and truly dissolved cd as well as dissolved and truly dissolved zn this range was wider at approximately 15 55 and 3 40 respectively for total cd and truly dissolved pb the cumulative load cumulative runoff curves could not be evaluated as in 25 and 35 samples out of 49 respectively the concentrations were below the loq 3 1 2 concentrations of total dissolved and truly dissolved metals the mean total metal concentrations in the runoff from the highway were for cd 0 079 0 04 µg l for pb 5 4 4 2 µg l for cu 36 21 µg l and for zn 288 126 µg l table s3 fig 1 the mean metal concentrations for dissolved metals 0 45 µm in the highway runoff were for cd 0 015 0 015 µg l for pb 0 057 0 037 µg l for cu 5 2 1 8 µg l and for zn 81 50 µg l the mean metal concentrations for truly dissolved metals 3 kda in the highway runoff were for cd 0 013 0 017 µg l pb 0 012 0 0057 µg l cu 2 5 1 1 µg l and zn 68 40 µg l one interesting observation was that during rain event f where the highest concentration of cl was measured in the road runoff 284 3010 mg l the peak concentrations of total dissolved and truly dissolved cd total pb as well as total zn were higher than during the rain events a e cl concentration 1 101 mg l figs 6 s10 s14 however data from six rain events are not sufficient to investigate correlations between environmental conditions and metal concentrations in stormwater which was outside the scope of this study 3 1 3 the metal speciation pb was present in this study on average to 99 in particulate form table s4 also cu and zn were present in the inflow often in particulate form with average percentages for cu of 86 and for zn of 72 fig s4 table s4 despite the high average percentage of particulate zn it must be noted that speciation of zn varied depending on the rain event as indicated in fig 3 during rain events a b and c considerably more zn is in the dissolved and truly dissolved fraction compared to events d e and f the proportion of particulate cd cannot be determined with certainty as many values were below the loq for cd and zn most of the dissolved metals were truly dissolved cd 90 zn 84 which results in only small colloidal fractions of these metals at the inflow to the treatment train for cu colloidal and truly dissolved fraction percentages were on average equal 7 3 1 4 discussion despite the observed variations in the metal concentrations during the rain events the first flush phenomenon defined by saget et al 1996 as the transport of 80 of the pollution load in the first 30 of the runoff event was not observed in this study for total dissolved and truly dissolved metals in the runoff from the highway figs 4 5 and s5 s9 the variations in total metals in the highway runoff may be linked to the variations of tss fig s14 as has been shown in previous studies galfi et al 2017 in this study spearman s correlation indicated strong correlations between total metal concentrations and tss concentration spearman s rho pb 0 950 p 0 000 cu 0 818 p 0 000 zn 0 836 p 0 000 cd n d which is not surprising since metals occurred in this study often predominantly in the particulate form although previous work documented partly increased total metal and or tss concentrations in the early phase of runoff events sansalone and buchberger 1997 davis 2007 nicolau et al 2012 maniquiz redillas and kim 2014 galfi et al 2017 earlier studies of inter event variations in stormwater using first flush criteria as in this study confirmed that the first flush phenomenon is rarely found for tss in storm runoff saget et al 1996 deletic and maksimovic 1998 although only six rain events were collected in this study our data is in line with previous findings by deletic 1998 who identified rain intensity and flow characteristic as most relevant factors affecting the transport and potential first flush of tss and particulate metals in this study the most pronounced deviation above the 1 1 diagonal in the cumulative load cumulative runoff diagram from tss fig s9 was observed for event b the event with the highest maximum rain intensity and the highest cumulative runoff volume table s2 although this study found no first flush of dissolved and truly dissolved cd cu and zn in the highway runoff elevated concentrations of dissolved and truly dissolved metals at the beginning of the runoff events were observed this supports the findings of sansalone and buchberger 1997 who studied stormwater sheet flow over urban pavements and found that the normalized transported mass of dissolved 0 45 µm cd cu and zn over time was mostly greater or equal to the normalized flow volume over time but not the normalized transported mass of dissolved pb also nicolau et al 2012 who studied total and dissolved metal concentration in an urban creek affected by stormwater inflow found that dissolved cu and zn concentrations and in some cases dissolved pb concentrations were elevated at the beginning of a stormwater flow event the decreases in concentrations of dissolved and truly dissolved metals over the course of a runoff event in this study can probably be attributed to dilution effects through the rainwater as observed previously by nicolau et al 2012 total dissolved and truly dissolved metal concentrations determined in the stormwater fig 1 are within the range of metal concentrations determined in a study of urban runoff quality by lindfors et al 2020 who used a similar size fractionation approach as in this study and thus were able to report results for total dissolved and truly dissolved in this case defined as 3000 molecular weight cut off mwco metals furthermore total metal concentrations are generally in the range determined by göbel et al 2007 for dense traffic areas only total cu concentration was lower than expected and correspond rather to low trafficked areas göbel et al 2007 reasons for elevated metal concentrations in stormwater during rain event f compared to the other rain events might be ion exchange and complexation processes as well as effects on particle stability induced by na and cl ions behbahani et al 2021 the elevated metal concentrations during rain event f in this study might be explained by dissolution from road dust or previously accumulated sediment in the stormwater pipes the results for metal speciation in this study are in line with earlier studies of metal speciation in stormwater it is common to find pb occurring in stormwater mainly in the particulate form tuccillo 2006 mckenzie and young 2013 flanagan et al 2018 also high particulate fractions of cu and zn have been previously observed in stormwater flanagan et al 2018 lindfors et al 2020 however ratios of particulate and dissolved cu and zn in stormwater can generally be variable depending on the catchment and the rain characteristics morrison et al 1990 sansalone and buchberger 1997 tuccillo 2006 maniquiz redillas and kim 2014 huber et al 2016 the relatively high ratios of particulate zn during events d e and f fig 3 may partly be explained with the higher ph during these events fig s14 which may have increased the adsorption of metals to organic matter and mineral particles in stormwater bradl 2004 pb and cu speciation was less affected by ph probably due to their higher affinity to complex with organic matter and mineral particles at lower ph compared to zn bradl 2004 the reason for the higher ph at events d e and f was likely due to an accident of a concrete mixing truck in the catchment during which the concrete load was partly released on the highway some previous studies subdivided the dissolved phase further to measure colloidal and truly dissolved metal fractions morrison et al 1990 tuccillo 2006 lindfors et al 2020 however only a few used a similar size fractionation approach as in this study lindfors et al 2020 used 0 45 µm and 3 kda filters to determine colloidal and truly dissolved metal fractions and as in this study they found small colloidal cu and zn fractions in runoff from urban catchments this has also been shown earlier by tuccillo 2006 who used 0 45 µm and 10 kda filters to determine colloidal and truly dissolved metal fractions in stormwater from suburban catchments 3 2 gpt outflow despite most of the cu pb and zn being mainly in particulate form in the highway runoff the gpt did not reduce metal concentrations nor had any significant effects on metal speciation fig 1 tables 1 s4 also the variations within the flow event were generally similar to the variations in the highway runoff fig s5 s14 a detailed description of the water quality in the gpt outflow and a discussion of the gpt function is provided in the supplementary information section s3 3 3 bioretention outflow in the effluent of the bioretention system metal concentrations were variable although peak concentrations often occurred during the first 100 m3 of discharge first flush events according to the definition of saget et al 1996 could not be observed generally reductions in total metal concentrations were statistically significant after passage through the bioretention system whereas dissolved and specifically truly dissolved metal concentrations were in some cases not reduced statistically significantly by the bioretention system similarly the speciation of cu and zn in bioretention effluent shifted towards stronger fractions of colloidal and truly dissolved metals 3 3 1 intra event variations in the effluent of the bioretention system total dissolved and truly dissolved metal concentrations generally varied throughout the bioretention outflow events for rain events a to d partial outflow events figs 2 3 and s10 s14 in contrast to the highway runoff and the gpt effluent concentration peaks of total dissolved and truly dissolved metals either occurred at the beginning of the effluent events within the first 100 m3 of the effluent or concentrations appeared relatively stable throughout the outflow event given a pore volume of the filter of only ca 60 m3 a well drained filter material i e no standing water and or continuing outflow prior to the rain and the lack of a submerged zone the majority of that water was newly treated water originating from that rain event at events b c and e being events with higher cumulative runoff a stabilization of total dissolved and truly dissolved metal concentrations was observed although the cumulative load cumulative outflow curves do not cover the whole outflow event for all rain events they reveal that deviations below the diagonal are less common in the effluent from the bioretention system compared to the highway stormwater and the outflow of the gpt figs 4 5 and s5 s9 for rain events e and f where approximately 90 of the rain event was covered small deviations from the diagonal in the cumulative load cumulative outflow curves indicate that the pollutant loads were discharged relatively evenly over the course of the outflow event after 30 of the total effluent from storms e and f had left the bioretention system approximately 30 40 of total dissolved and truly dissolved cu and zn and truly dissolved cd and dissolved pb load were discharged from the bioretention system for total pb and total cd effluent concentrations were mostly below loq generally for rain events e and f the difference between the cumulative load cumulative outflow curves of total and dissolved as well as truly dissolved metals is not as distinct as in the stormwater for rain events b c and d only the first 50 60 of the rain events could be covered in the sampling campaign however cumulative load cumulative outflow curves indicate that at least during the first 50 60 of the runoff the curves for total dissolved and truly dissolved metals are very similar for the respective metal i e distinctly different courses of cumulative load cumulative outflow curves between total and dissolved truly dissolved metals as observed in the stormwater and the gross pollutant trap do not mostly exist in the outflow for total dissolved and truly dissolved zn and cu at rain event b the deviations above the diagonal were generally larger than for events c and d figs 4 5 and s7 8 indicating that for this event a more pronounced initial concentration drop in the initial effluent occurred at event a only the first 30 of the outflow event was covered by the sampling campaign making the interpretation of these data regarding the intra event variations difficult 3 3 2 the concentrations of total dissolved and truly dissolved metals after passage through the bioretention system total and dissolved metal concentrations were mostly statistically significantly lower than in the highway runoff or the effluent of the gpt fig 1 table s3 only the concentration of dissolved cd was not statistically significantly reduced by the bioretention system treatment performance for total cd could not be statistically evaluated since also inflow concentrations were often below loq however fig s10 indicates efficient removal when stormwater concentrations were above the loq along with the significant concentration reductions for total and most dissolved metals removal of dissolved metals was for dissolved cu 18 and zn 67 on average lower than for total cu 79 and zn 94 table 1 removal of dissolved cd was very variable between the rain events with a mean removal of 8 also for dissolved pb leaching was observed 16 however this is probably because the fraction of dissolved pb was small truly dissolved metals were mostly not significantly reduced by the bioretention system truly dissolved metal removal cd 11 cu 7 7 fig 1 tables 1 s3 with the exception of truly dissolved zn which was significantly reduced mean removal 65 table 1 furthermore the concentration volume graphs show that the zn total dissolved truly dissolved and cd dissolved truly dissolved concentrations in event f were higher than during the other rain events the tss concentrations in the effluent of the bioretention system were always low partly loq fig 1 thus conclusions about correlations between tss and metal concentrations cannot be drawn for the effluent 3 3 3 speciation cu and zn speciation in the outflow of the bioretention system changed compared to the speciation in the stormwater and the outflow of the gpt table s4 and fig s4 on average for cu the ratio of the colloidal fraction increased from 7 sw gpt to 32 at the outflow of the bioretention system the ratio of the truly dissolved fraction increased from 7 t 8 sw or gpt respectively to 43 at the outflow of the bioretention system for zn the truly dissolved fraction increased from 23 to 22 sw and gpt respectively to 63 while the ratio of the colloidal fraction was 5 in the stormwater 4 after the gpt and 7 at the outflow of the bioretention system at the outflow pb and cd were often below the loq and thus speciation could not be determined the data suggest however that most of the dissolved cd in the outflow was truly dissolved 3 3 4 discussion as seen with the highway runoff for the effluent of the bioretention system there was no first flush observed for total dissolved and truly dissolved metals but metal concentrations peaked often but not always at the beginning of the effluent events the same pattern of variations in metal concentrations in the bioretention effluent have been observed previously for total and dissolved metals in the field davis 2007 hatt et al 2009 lange et al 2017 and a laboratory study blecken et al 2009 blecken et al 2009 carried out a pilot scale laboratory experiment where they found significantly higher total pb cu and zn concentrations in the initial outflow of bioretention columns the studies by davis 2007 hatt et al 2009 and lange et al 2017 only corroborate this for single events i e no general first flush phenomenon was detected in the bioretention outflow in their studies labarre et al 2016 report a first flush for total cu for 3 out of 7 rain events in the effluent of a pilot scale bioretention system treating roof runoff from two 1 5 3 m cu roof sections when initial metal concentrations peaks occur this might be explained by mobilization of metals captured in the filter material due to oxidation processes in the top layer of the filter material during dry conditions dilution of metals into porewater of the filter material during the period between rain events and processes at the wetting front created at the beginning of a rain event bartlett and james 1980 blecken et al 2009 hatt et al 2009 subramaniam et al 2015 further as earlier shown for stormwater by deletic 1998 the factors flow volume and flow intensity may play a role for the occurrence of first flush in the effluent the highest deviations above the 1 1 line in the cumulative load runoff graphs fig s5 s9 were observed for event b which had the highest peak flow 10 l s and flow volume 590 m3 of all rains however for a more detailed evaluation data from further storm events would have been needed table s2 generally total metals are efficiently treated in bioretention systems with removal percentages of greater than 67 davis 2007 blecken et al 2009 hatt et al 2009 feng et al 2012 by filtration processes in the top layer of the bioretention system lefevre et al 2015 al ameri et al 2018 less effective treatment of dissolved metals was observed in earlier bioretention studies maniquiz redillas and kim 2014 søberg et al 2017 lange et al 2020b the underlying main treatment processes for dissolved metals in bioretention systems are diverse sorption processes where organic matter content of the filter media design of the system including vegetation selection stormwater composition and environmental conditions all play an important role and explain a higher variability of treatment efficiency paus et al 2014 lefevre et al 2015 søberg et al 2017 lange et al 2020b the leaching or limited removal of truly dissolved cd pb and cu in this study was different to the results of the only laboratory column study on truly dissolved metal treatment in bioretention systems to date by lange et al 2020a where considerable removals 80 were observed for truly dissolved cd cu and zn the reasons for these high reductions could be that there was more organic matter om in the filter material of the laboratory columns 14 3 g om kg dry mass dm than in the field bioretention system in this study 3 2 g om kg dm specifically cu has a high affinity for the sorption to om bradl 2004 a positive effect of increased om content was shown by for example paus et al 2014 further the columns in the study by lange et al 2020a experienced constant environmental conditions e g no dry periods which could lead to mobilization of metals as shown by among others by lange et al 2020b besides the positive effects on metal treatment metal sorption to om also carries the risk of metal leaching complexed with doc blecken et al 2009 lefevre et al 2015 in the effluent of the bioretention system in this study total dissolved and truly dissolved cu concentrations were correlated with concentrations of doc spearman rho total cu 0 475 p 0 000 dissolved cu 0 645 p 0 000 truly dissolved cu 0 559 p 0 000 this was also shown previously in a column study with non vegetated systems by chahal et al 2016 and indicated in a batch experiment by charbonnet et al 2020 the fact that also truly dissolved cu is correlated with doc indicates that high quantities of the truly dissolved cu fraction may still be complexed to small organic compounds and thus potentially less toxic compared to free cu ions alloway 2013 in our study dissolved and truly dissolved zn were treated more effectively compared to the other metals table 1 this is likely caused by the lower affinity of zn to om compared to cu and also pb and cd bradl 2004 gülbaz et al 2015 alloway 2013 the correlation between doc concentrations and dissolved zn concentrations was only weak spearman rho dissolved zn 0 272 p 0 049 and for truly dissolved zn not significant spearman rho truly dissolved zn 0 221 p 0 112 thus other factors than doc determine the zn treatment in the bioretention system as previously been shown in an experiment with vegetated columns by zhao et al 2007 generally it can be assumed that the conditions in the bioretention filter material mixed with caco3 favor metal sorption since caco3 addition alters the soil chemistry by increasing the soil ph alloway 2013 at higher ph an increased amount of charged metal binding sites are available in the soil and metal sorption is facilitated bradl 2004 a positive effect of the caco3 addition on dissolved zn removal was shown by fahlbeck carlsson 2021 who compared total and dissolved metal treatment in the bioretention cell with caco3 that is the subject of our study f1 with the metal treatment in the parallel bioretention cell where no caco3 was added the increased metal concentrations during event f were probably due to the increased cl concentration 860 1400 mg l due to application of road salt and can be explained by ion exchange processes complexation processes and effects on particle stability bäckström et al 2004 søberg et al 2017 behbahani et al 2021 the effective removal of particulate metals and less effective removal of dissolved and truly dissolved metals causes the speciation shift between inflow and outflow metal fraction ratios søberg et al 2017 as observed for cu and zn in this study to date there is only one other bioretention study where particulate colloidal and truly dissolved fractions were determined in a laboratory column experiment lange et al 2020a reported in their bioretention study an increase in the colloidal and truly dissolved fractions of cu and zn after water passed through bioretention columns for effluent cu and zn they reported larger colloidal fractions 41 50 and 13 23 that might be attributed in the case of cu to the organic matter content of filter media and doc concentrations in the effluent e g chahal et al 2016 however the doc concentrations in the effluent of their study were not determined 3 4 overall performance of the treatment train the overall treatment within the treatment train was effective for total metals with removal percentages of 76 for total pb 81 for total cu and 94 for total zn table 1 for dissolved metals treatment was less effective for pb cu and zn with mean removal percentages of 6 6 22 and 77 respectively dissolved cd removal was 30 the removal of truly dissolved metals was even lower with 19 for cd and 5 7 for cu only truly dissolved zn was as equally well removed as dissolved zn 76 the metal treatment mainly occurred in the bioretention system and not in the gpt while pb cu and zn occurred often as particulate metals at the inflow of the treatment train in the effluent only pb was mainly particulate while cu and zn occurred as colloidal or truly dissolved metals table s4 in the inflow the colloidal fraction was generally small and dissolved cd cu and zn were mainly in truly dissolved form in the effluent colloidal zn and cu fractions increased the speciation change is likely responsible for the decrease in total metal intra event variations from influent to effluent of the treatment train in the inflow total metal concentrations were commonly very variable throughout the events while dissolved and truly dissolved fractions decreased or were stable over time in the outflow where most metals were in dissolved or truly dissolved form generally decreasing or stable concentrations were observed 3 5 environmental impact and practical implications despite efficient treatment of total metals the bioretention system could only partly reduce the adverse impact of stormwater on the receiving water total metal concentrations as well as dissolved pb and cd concentrations partly exceeded swedish environmental threshold values for receiving waterbodies or stormwater discharge riktvärdesgruppen 2009 swam 2016 swam 2019 figs s10 s14 in the runoff and the effluent of the gpt but not in the effluent of the bioretention system however dissolved and truly dissolved zn and cu mean concentrations exceeded swedish environmental threshold values for receiving waterbodies 2 4 and 7 µg l for dissolved cu and zn in lakes swam 2016 0 5 and 5 5 µg l for bioavailable cu and zn riktvärdesgruppen 2009 figs 2 3 not only in the runoff and the effluent of the gpt but also in the effluent from the bioretention system and that even though the treatment of dissolved zn in the treatment train was efficient 77 that threshold values of dissolved but specifically of truly dissolved metals are exceeded in the effluent from the bioretention system is particularly critical since the truly dissolved fraction may indicate the relative magnitude of the bioavailable fraction and thus the environmental toxicity of cu and zn markich et al 2001 lindfors et al 2021 this shows that if only total metal concentrations would have been measured potentially toxic events that would be in violation of dissolved metals regulations e g swam 2016 swam 2019 could been overseen further studies should thus include dissolved metal fractions despite initial metal concentrations peaks the intra event variations of zn and cu concentrations did not show a clear first flush this is in line with the results by saget et al 1996 who report that a first flush is very scarce even if one would apply a less strict first flush definition than they did in view of potential mitigation strategies this emphasizes that it would not be sufficient to threat only the first fraction of the bioretention effluent as concluded in earlier studies on treatment of runoff saget et al 1996 deletic and maksimovic 1998 huber et al 2016 4 conclusions intra events variations of total dissolved and truly dissolved metal concentrations in highway runoff and treatment in a stormwater treatment train comprising a gpt and a bioretention system were investigated using 153 samples collected during six rains intra event variations in metal concentrations were observed in the runoff and the effluent of the treatment steps generally no first flush was observed while total metals were removed efficiently by the bioretention system removal of dissolved metals was lower while truly dissolved cd and cu were generally not effectively removed average removal cd 11 cu 7 7 the mean removal of truly dissolved zn was 65 still truly dissolved cu and zn concentrations in the effluent exceeded environmental threshold values which emphasizes how important it is to not only measure total metal removal when evaluating bioretention treatment efficiency this is also underlined by the metal speciation change within the bioretention system while the metals occurred in the highway runoff mainly in particulate form the speciation of cu and zn in the bioretention effluent shifted towards greater fractions of colloidal and truly dissolved metals the gpt had no significant effect on metal concentrations and speciation future research should therefore focus on optimizing bioretention systems for the treatment of dissolved and truly dissolved metals and on the development of better pre treatment facilities further to understand inter event variations of total dissolved and truly dissolved metals better more field experiments should be carried out generating more data on

16079,three ocean dumping sites located in the yellow sea ys and east sea es of south korea have accumulated terrestrial waste from 1988 to 2015 most of this waste comprised industrial wastewater and sewage sludge which are sources of microplastics in this study we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution and characteristics of microplastics in surface and core sediments of the ys south sea ss and es including at dumping sites ydp and edp the mean abundance of microplastics in surface sediments was ranked in order of edp 59 457 49 130 particles kg d w es 5 047 9 404 particles kg d w ydp 3 965 3 213 particles kg d w ss 314 488 particles kg d w and ys 288 400 particles kg d w edp and ydp showed about 14 and 12 fold higher microplastic abundances and more diverse polymer compositions than the es and ys respectively the historical trend of microplastic pollution in age dated core sediments from edp and ydp aligned well with the amount of historical ocean dumping as the level of ocean dumping has gradually reduced since 2006 and was finally banned in 2015 the microplastic abundance decreased accordingly interestingly spherical polystyrene ps primary microplastic was the dominant type in edp sediments 78 and other surface sediments in the es 52 more than 60 million tons of sewage and wastewater sludge were dumped at edp and extremely high abundances of up to 130 000 particles kg d w were observed in edp surface sediments ps primary microplastics were continuously present in the edp and es sediment cores in the dumping period and are suspected to have originated from industrial wastewater sludge the particle transportation model results showed that ps was dispersed throughout the es during ocean dumping in addition deep circulation can contribute to the dispersion of particles after sinking these results indicate that ocean dumping sites represent an underwater hotspot and source of microplastics in seafloor sediments keywords microplastics sediment core ocean dumping continental shelf deep sea 1 introduction microplastics are widely distributed in aquatic environments including freshwater coastal open ocean deep sea and polar regions woodall et al 2014 peeken et al 2018 song et al 2018 eo et al 2019 pan et al 2019 it has been estimated that approximately 6300 million metric tons of plastic waste was generated in 1950 2015 79 of which accumulated in landfills or the natural environment geyer et al 2017 due to its durability plastic is persistent in the environment over a long period but weathering occurs on its surface nanoplastics and microplastics have been produced through ultraviolet exposure and mechanical abrasion of plastics in laboratory experiments gigault et al 2016 song et al 2017 smaller plastics are biologically available to a wide range of organisms and lead to harmful physical and chemical effects at high exposure levels wright et al 2013 jang et al 2016 cho et al 2019 the seafloor is considered the final destination of microplastics in the marine environment woodal et al 2014 kanhai et al 2019 näkki et al 2019 microplastics have been found in sediments from coasts frias et al 2016 ling et al 2017 phuong et al 2018 the deep sea tekman et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 and even the mariana trench at depths greater than 10 000 m peng et al 2018 plastics that are less dense than seawater as well as those denser than seawater can reach the seafloor due to biological interactions kooi et al 2017 porter et al 2018 kvale et al 2020 microplastics in sediment can be ingested by benthic organisms causing adverse effects bour et al 2018 wang et al 2019 sfrisoet al 2020 as sediment can accumulate microplastics over a long period of time investigation of microplastics in sediment is useful for understanding the long term contamination status which reflects the characteristics of the area although seafloor sediment is a known sink for microplastics microplastic pollution in shelf and deep sea sediments has not yet been well addressed the yellow sea ys receives a large amount of plastic discharge from chinese rivers lebreton et al 2017 and has relatively high abundances of microplastics in the water and sediment zhao et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 the east sea es is a deep sea with its own circulation that is useful for investigating open ocean processes however information about microplastic pollution levels and characteristics in sediments of the eastern ys south sea ss and es is limited revealing the distribution and characteristics of microplastics in korean offshore sediments will provide useful information for understanding the distribution and fate of microplastics in continental shelf e g the eastern ys and ss and deep sea e g the es regions of the global ocean in particular three ocean dumping sites are located in the ys and es which have accommodated terrestrial waste from 1988 to 2015 dumping began with 5 5 105 m3 of waste in 1988 and reached a maximum amount of 9 9 106 m3 in 2005 mof 2020 most of the waste was comprised of sludge from industrial wastewater and sewage treatment works which are known sources of microplastics murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 thus investigation of whether the sediments at the dumping site are a hotspot or source of microplastics is needed ocean dumping has been banned but microplastic contamination can be expected due to the previous mass dumping over a long period however little research has been conducted on ocean dumping sites in korea and other countries despite sewage addition being discontinued for more than a decade dumping sites retained more microplastics than reference sites in the uk browne et al 2011 in this study we investigated the abundance and characteristics of microplastics larger than 20 μm in sediments of the ys and ss continental shelf areas as well as the es deep sea area including three dumping sites we tested the following hypotheses 1 the ys which receives vigorous riverine input from korea and china will have the highest abundance of microplastics and variety of polymer types among the three seas and 2 the abundance of microplastics in the sediment will be higher at dumping sites than in surrounding areas this study will provide baseline data on microplastic contamination in korean offshore sediments and contribute to the establishment of a global distribution map of microplastics the findings will provide useful information about microplastic contamination caused by ocean dumping 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the ys and ss form a semi enclosed continental shelf sea surrounded by the korean peninsula and china with a combined area of 380 000 km2 and average and maximum depths of 44 and 103 m respectively fig s1 the es is a deep sea area surrounded by korea japan and russia with a total area of 1070 000 km2 and average and maximum depths of 1361 and 4049 m respectively although the es is much smaller than a world ocean it is referred to as a miniature ocean because it has characteristics similar to those of open oceans dumping of terrestrial waste occurred from 1988 to 2015 at one site in the ys ys a and two sites in the es es a and es b ys a located approximately 200 km from land covers a total area of 3165 km2 es a 125 km from land and es b 63 km from land have total areas of 3700 and 1616 km2 respectively dumped materials include manure livestock wastewater sewage treatment wastewater and sludge dredged material and processed fishery products mof 2020 2 2 sampling of microplastics in surface and core sediments sediment samples were collected at eight non dumping sites and four dumping sites in the ys as well as five non dumping sites in the ss of korea from r v eardo in july and august 2018 fig 1 in july and august 2019 sediment samples from eight non dumping sites and seven dumping sites were sampled in the es from r v eardo sampling was conducted using a van veen grab in the ys and ss and a box corer in the es due to the greater depth of that sea approximately 250 ml of surface sediment from the top 2 cm was collected into a glass bottle using a stainless steel spoon single sediment cores were collected from non dumping and dumping sites in the ys ys5 and ydp2 and es es5 and edp1 each core was collected using a box corer with a polyvinyl chloride pvc core barrel gently inserted into the box core to minimize disturbance the diameter and length of the barrel were 12 4 cm and 35 cm respectively 2 3 core sectioning and dating the cores were cut using a core splitter at intervals of 1 cm until 10 cm from the top and at intervals of 2 cm thereafter core sediments from each section were transferred into 250 ml bottles then 1 g of oven dried 60 c sediments from each section was used for determination of 210pb activities using the alpha decay of its daughter nuclide 210po at the korea basic science institute the age of sediment at each depth was estimated from excess 210pb derived linear sedimentation rates for details see si 2 4 analysis of surface sediment samples the sediment in contact with the pvc core barrel was discarded to avoid contamination then 100 g of wet sediment sample was subsampled for further analysis to obtain the ratio of wet to dry sediment approximately 1 g of wet sediment was dried and weighed diluted lithium metatungstate lmt 1 6 g cm3 was poured into the sample beaker until the total volume was 200 ml and the wet sediment sample was stirred with a stainless steel spoon for 1 min after settling for 1 hour the supernatant was transferred to a 1 l glass beaker this process was repeated two more times the beaker was left for 24 h to allow particles in samples heavier than the lmt solution to settle the supernatant in the beaker was passed through a 20 µm metal sieve and washed with high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade water the particles on the sieve were transferred to a 250 ml glass beaker containing hplc grade water the water in the beaker was fully dried at 60 c in an oven organic matter in the samples was digested using 20 ml of 35 h2o2 and fe ii solution on a hot plate 60 c 180 rpm for 30 min after that the process of adding h2o2 every 30 min was repeated 3 5 times per sample the sediment was collected on a 20 µm metal sieve to remove the digestion solution and then washed with hplc grade water the sample was transferred into a 250 ml glass density separation funnel using lmt and allowed to settle for 24 h after settling the bottom layer was drained and the upper portion was filtered onto 5 µm polycarbonate filter paper using a vacuum pump based on the number of microplastics identified on the filter paper 12 5 100 of the total filtered area was randomly selected for examination all particles that appeared to be plastic within the selected range of the filter paper were identified using a fourier transform infrared ft ir microscope nicolet in10 thermo fisher scientific usa in attenuated total reflectance mode the spectrum was recorded through 16 scans in the spectral range of 675 4000 cm 1 2 5 analysis of core sediment samples after age dating 10 12 core sections were selected from each core to observe the historical trend of microplastic pollution over time table s1 for this analysis 50 g of wet sediment sample was subsampled and the ratio of wet to dry weight was measured using 1 g of wet sediment the experimental process was the same as that used for surface sediment analysis the quality control and blank sample test and statistical analyses are provided in the si 2 6 particle tracking model a lagrangian particle tracking model was used to investigate the effect of ocean dumping on the distribution pattern of microplastics on the seafloor the model was based on seo and park 2020 and seo et al 2020 but used three dimensional velocities without wind drift as follows x t δ t x t t t δ t u c x t τ w x t τ d τ r 2 k h δ t here x t is the position of a particle at time t and δ t is the time interval set to 10 min in this study the input data u c are horizontal ocean currents from the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom https www hycom org global ocean forecast system gofs 3 1 and w is the sinking velocity of particles in the water column as described below the input data were linearly interpolated to particle positions and model time steps r is a random number between 1 and 1 and k h is the horizontal diffusion coefficient adopted from the smagorinsky 1963 mixing scheme when the particle had reached the bottom depth it was considered completely settled we assumed that microplastic particles sank together with the dumped waste which consisted mainly of liquid and sludge thus the sinking rate of microplastic particles was determined by the sinking velocity of the waste the composition of the waste is unknown so we set the sinking velocity to 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 0 and 2 5 cm s which are within the range proposed by fry and butman 1991 note that the sinking velocity was greater than typical vertical velocities of ocean circulation so the effect of the latter process was ignored the deepest part of the study area in the ulleung basin of the east sea is about 2500 m in depth and approximately 58 29 14 10 3 and 1 day s would be required for waste to sink the bottom at the sinking velocities listed above respectively three dumping sites were investigated designated es a es b and ys a fig 1 at each dumping site particles were released at locations 0 05 apart in both the zonal and meridional directions with 510 178 and 510 release points in es a es b and ys a respectively a total of 13 million particles were released daily from january 1 2003 to december 31 2007 when two years after the volume of dumped waste was greatest individual particles were tracked until they reached the bottom the model results were averaged across all cases and expressed as the probability of settlement in each area 3 results 3 1 abundance and spatial distribution of microplastics in surface sediment the mean abundance of microplastics was ranked in order of edp 59 457 49 130 particles kg d w es 5047 9404 particles kg d w ydp 3965 3213 particles kg d w ss 314 488 particles kg d w and ys 288 400 particles kg d w the spatial distribution of microplastics is shown in fig 1 exceptionally high microplastic abundances in surface sediments were found at two dumping sites ys a and es a compared to the non dumping sites the abundances of microplastics at ydp and edp were about 12 and 14 fold higher than average levels in ys and es respectively and these differences were significant mann whitney u test p 0 05 relatively high abundances of microplastics were found at ys4 1200 particles kg d w and ys5 520 particles kg d w which are located on both sides of the dumping site ys a similarly in the es high abundances of microplastics were observed at es8 27 523 particles kg d w and es7 7686 particles kg d w which are located northwest of dumping site es a these stations contributed to the high mean abundance of microplastics in the es which was 1 3 fold higher than the mean abundance in ydp the highest abundance in the ss 1180 particles kg d w was detected at ss2 which is located near the coast 3 2 size shape and polymer composition of microplastics in surface sediment as microplastic size decreased the abundance of microplastics increased in es and edp samples fig s2 in the ys ss and ydp a similar tendency was observed but the abundance of microplastics decreased again in the 20 50 μm size bin the percentage of microplastics less than 300 μm in size was greater than 90 in ys 93 0 es 93 3 and edp 96 8 and 70 in ss 77 7 and ydp 75 8 the peak size range was 20 50 μm in es 43 6 and edp 56 3 50 100 μm in ys 49 6 and ss 32 5 and 100 150 μm in ydp 21 9 the most abundant microplastic shape was spherical in es 51 6 and edp 77 8 followed by fragments fig 2 among 1741 spherical microplastics counted in sediments from es and edp all except 5 were polystyrene ps therefore ps was dominant in edp 80 2 and the es 53 fig 3 and table s2 polypropylene pp 21 8 and polyester pes 11 each accounted for more than 10 of microplastics in the es the fragment type was dominant in the ys 78 6 ydp 68 6 and ss 57 6 followed by fibers spherical microplastics were absent from the ss the polymer composition of ss was 29 0 pes 21 1 pp 14 9 polyethylene pe 7 polyacrylate copolymers and 5 3 poly acrylate styrene pp accounted for 42 1 of microplastics in the ys followed by acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs 12 9 pe 6 3 and ps 5 at ydp ps 18 3 was dominant followed by abs 13 6 pes 12 4 polyacrylate copolymers 10 3 polyamide pa 9 3 pp 7 7 pvc 6 2 and pe 5 5 other polymers not named here accounted for less than 5 of all microplastics 3 3 temporal distribution of microplastics in core sediments the sedimentation rates estimated from 210pb excess were 0 37 0 09 0 33 and 0 19 cm y for sediment cores from ys5 es5 ydp2 and edp1 respectively the analyzed depths and corresponding sediment ages are listed in table s1 the microplastic abundances in ys5 and es5 showed a repeating pattern of increases and decreases with an overall increasing trend over time fig s3 abundances increased rapidly after the 2000s and in core es5 decreased in the top layer the abundance of microplastics in each core section is presented as an average value across a sediment interval of 1 2 cm because 1 cm of sediment represented 3 and 5 years in ydp2 and edp1 respectively the amount of dumping at ys a and es a was averaged across a period corresponding to the assessed depth mof 2020 the amount of ocean dumping gradually increased until the 2000s and then decreased fig 4 the maximum amounts dumped were 2 4 million tons at ys a in 2001 and 4 4 million tons at es a in 2006 until the 1980s the abundance of microplastic was less than 1000 particles kg d w and abundance increased gradually from bottom to top in cores ydp2 and edp1 microplastic abundance increased rapidly to more than 10 000 particles kg d w in the mid 2000s and decreased thereafter a correlation was found between the microplastic distribution in core sediments and amount of ocean dumping for edp1 pearson correlation p 0 05 but not ydp2 the highest microplastic abundances were observed for ys5 in 2018 2933 particles kg d w es5 in 2002 4603 particles kg d w ydp2 in 2007 40 340 particles kg d w and edp1 in 2006 123 984 particles kg d w the lowest abundances of microplastics were found at the bottoms of all cores except ydp2 3 4 size shape and polymer composition of microplastics in core sediments the numbers of microplastic polymer types tended to increase from the bottom to top of all he sediment cores the most abundant polymer was pp in ys5 47 and es5 39 pes in ydp2 43 6 and ps in edp1 66 1 fig 5 fragments accounted for 69 1 of particles in ys5 followed by fibers 30 9 fig 6 a ydp2 showed large proportions of fragment 55 4 and fiber 42 2 while few spheres 2 4 were found fig 6b es5 showed the highest proportion of fragments prior to 1957 71 7 but spheres have accounted for a large proportion since 1968 57 4 fig 6c spheres were dominant at all depths in edp1 62 9 fig 6d approximately 99 7 of spheres found in surface sediments of the es were ps 3 5 distribution pattern of microplastics based on model estimation in all cases of the lagrangian particle tracking modeling the abundances of settled particles at the dumping sites were high fig 7 particles were released evenly across the dumping sites and the abundances did not exhibit notable spatial patterns within dumping sites particle dispersion patterns were determined by both ocean currents and the depths of the dumping sites dumping site ys a is about 80 m in depth and the smallest amount of particles was found outside of the dumping site using lagrangian particle model prediction fig 7a es b at about 150 m in depth is deeper than ys a and particles were dispersed further fig 7c around the depth of es a the effect of ocean currents on the dispersion of settled particle is most apparent fig 7b particles with slower sinking velocities are affected more the model results were compared with the observations of the abundance of spherical microplastic which was thought to have originated from the dumping site from the observed result at ys a the abundance of spherical microplastic outside the dumping site was 0 11 1 of that in ydp4 which had the maximum abundance of spherical microplastic within the dumping site the modeled particles were limited to the dumping site and reproduced the restricted dispersion of particles outside the ys a dumping site well in depth comparison was made for es a where sufficient observation data were obtained fig 8 a the correlation between the model and observed distribution patterns is about 0 87 more specifically the changes in abundance of microplastics away from the center of the dumping site along sampling locations edp4 edp3 es8 es7 and es4 were compared fig 8b both the observations and model show similar attenuation rates in es b there was only one sampling station and there was insufficient observational data to compare with the model 4 discussion 4 1 seafloor as a repository of sedimentary microplastics the abundance of microplastics is 17 6 and 12 6 fold significantly higher kruskal wallis test p 0 05 in the es than in ys and ss respectively thus hypothesis 1 the ys which receives vigorous riverine input from korea and china will have the highest abundance of microplastics and variety of polymer types among the three seas was rejected in this study as spherical primary microplastics were generally observed in the es surface sediments surveyed the entire es appears to have been affected by ocean dumping discussed in section 4 3 in particular es5 es7 and es8 which showed exceptionally high microplastic abundances were likely more directly affected by ocean dumping than other areas similarly relatively high abundances of microplastics were observed at ys4 and ys5 located on the eastern and western sides of dumping site ys a and spherical primary microplastics considered evidence of ocean dumping were found only at these two stations in the ys excluding three sites in the es and two in the ys which showed exceptionally high abundances of microplastics due to the strong influence of ocean dumping the mean abundance of microplastics in surface sediments of the three seas offshore of korea was 357 283 particles kg d w it was an order of magnitude higher than the values reported in the baltic sea zobkov and esiukova 2017 gulf of biscay phuong et al 2018 and bering sea chukchi sea shelf mu et al 2019 the western pacific ocean zhang et al 2020 and tyrrhenian sea cannas et al 2017 showed ranges of microplastic abundance similar to those in the present study the range of abundances in this study is lower than in deep sea studies conducted at the hausgarten observatory tekman et al 2020 and mariana trench peng et al 2018 the abundance of microplastics in the eastern ys in this study fell between those reported in the southern 72 particles kg d w and northern 124 particles kg d w ys zhao et al 2018 sediment is considered a temporary repository of sunken microplastics comparing the sediment microplastic abundances in this study with levels in waters at the same stations eo et al 2021 surface sediment had approximately 6700 7500 and 3400 fold using the same units of particles m3 higher abundance than the surface middle and bottom waters respectively assuming a 1 m2 column with a surface water layer 1 m water column layer 22 2215 m surface sediment layer 0 02 m and deep sediment layer below 0 02 m the proportion of the total amount of microplastics in each layer was estimated based on the abundance of microplastics in core sediment of ys5 and es5 about 50 of the total amount of microplastics in sediment were present in the top 2 cm of the sediment therefore it was assumed that the same amount of microplastics in the surface sediment were present in the deep sediment the microplastic distribution was 0 7 1 3 in the surface water 69 1 24 5 in the water column 15 1 12 2 in the surface sediment and 15 1 12 2 in the deep sediment fig s4 the range of microplastic proportion in the total sediment was 9 3 84 4 average 38 2 25 9 in the continental shelf region ys and ss and 0 2 41 8 average 17 3 15 5 in the deep sea region es this difference is due to the large volume of the water column in the offshore region using the same calculation for the nakdong river sediment accounted for 83 4 of microplastics in a 1 m2 square column with water depth of 8 4 m eo et al 2019 these results indicate that microplastics accumulate strongly in seafloor sediments and the sediment can be considered a repository of sunken microplastics 4 2 underwater hidden microplastic hotspots since dumping began at es a a rapid increase and decrease in the amount of dumping at that site before and after 2006 was observed which aligned with the trend in the abundance of microplastics in core edp1 fig 4a the pattern of increasing and decreasing dumping levels at ys a was similar to that of the abundance of microplastics at ydp2 with a time lag of 6 years fig 4b as a significant correlation was found between the microplastic distribution in edp1 core sediment and amount of ocean dumping at es a microplastics in that core may be directly affected by ocean dumping the abundance of microplastics in core ydp2 decreased with the decreasing amount of dumping until 2013 and then showed a slight increase in 2018 although no significant correlation was found it is unlikely that ocean dumping had no impact at ydp2 microplastic abundance exceeding 1000 particles kg was rarely observed in shelf or deep sea sedimentary environments e g bergmann et al 2017 peng et al 2018 tekman et al 2020 kane et al 2020 however most studies have reported microplastic abundances of less than 1000 particles kg in these environments harris 2020 the exceptionally high abundances of microplastics in sediments at edp and ydp are rare in marine environments without a specific source similarly browne et al 2011 reported that the abundance of microplastics was significantly higher in sediments at sewage disposal sites than at reference sites in the uk hypothesis 2 the abundance of microplastics in the sediment will be higher at dumping sites than in surrounding areas was accepted these results demonstrate that the abundance of microplastics was affected by ocean dumping in the particle transportation model results particles were released evenly across dumping site ys a and the model showed no notable spatial structure fig 7a the observed pattern suggests that within the dumping site the area closer to the coast was preferred for dumping the model did not reproduce the high abundance at station ys4 located east of the dumping site tides which are not considered in hycom could have contributed to this discrepancy the high observed abundances of microplastics at stations edp1 edp4 were due to waste dumping at es a fig 7b the high microplastic abundance at edp7 located on the southern edge of dumping site es b was due to the waste dumping at that site fig 7c note that the amount of waste dumped at es b is about 42 of the amount at es a and that edp7 is located at the upstream edge of the dumping site mof 2020 therefore the observed abundance was lower at edp7 than at stations within es a the high observed abundance of microplastics at es8 was due to westward flow from the dumping site along the edge of the ulleung basin es7 was affected by eddy driven dispersion of particles few particles reach north of 37 n and the observed numbers of microplastics were substantially lower at es1 and es2 than around the dumping sites microplastics occurred at es5 and es6 due to counterclockwise circulation within the deep ulleung basin according to the model microplastics within waste were dispersed throughout the es except in shallow coastal areas during ocean dumping therefore sources exist near es3 and they must originate from the land rather than ocean dumping stations ydp1 ydp4 are within the dumping site ys a and the abundances of microplastics are high in accordance with the model results along the eastern edge of the site the observed values were higher than the model estimates the impacts of ocean dumping have been investigated for numerous contaminants including microplastics high concentrations of alkylphenolic chemicals were found as a result of ocean dumping hong and shin 2009 and the time of heavy metal enrichment corresponded to the period of increasing ocean dumping kim et al 2009 however since the 2006 introduction of the rest year system and capping with dredged material at the ys a dumping site annual variations in metal concentrations have gradually decreased chung et al 2017 as ocean dumping was reduced in quantity beginning in 2006 and then banned in 2015 the microplastic abundance in the sediment core also gradually decreased with the reduction in dumping even if the input of plastics ceased microplastic pollution would persist for many years however this study demonstrated that ocean dumping was an obvious source of microplastics and that microplastic pollution in surface sediments at the dumping sites was mitigated by controlling its input sludge produced in wastewater treatment plants can be disposed of in landfills or reused as fertilizer but may cause secondary pollution of microplastics in the terrestrial environment jiang et al 2020 hou et al 2021 microplastics are introduced to surrounding soil through landfill leachate and increasing microplastic abundance in soil was observed after the reuse of fertilizer made from sludge corradini et al 2019 he et al 2019 these findings indicate that control of known sources of microplastics is essential 4 3 primary spherical microplastics an indicator of dispersion of ocean dumping waste spherical microplastics were found throughout the surface sediments of the es both ys a and es a were affected by ocean dumping but the microplastic shape and polymer compositions differed at ydp and edp since terrestrial waste from the western and eastern parts of south korea were dumped separately in ys a and es a respectively different types of waste were expected to be dumped at each site although the exact source has not been identified it was presumed that sludge dumped at es a contained large amounts of spherical microplastic except for the ps spheres fragments in shape and abs in the polymer were the most abundant types at both ydp and edp the abundance of spherical microplastics was 6 and 4 fold higher than that of non spherical microplastics at edp and es respectively in addition spherical microplastics were dominant in es5 core sediments after the 1960s and sections of edp1 although ocean dumping began in 1988 microplastics arising from dumping can be transported downward through bioturbation or with sediment pore water näkki et al 2017 gebhardt and forster 2018 spherical shape is representative of primary microplastics which are manufactured for applications such as cosmetics and personal care products curren et al 2020 determining the origin of fragment type microplastic is difficult as they are created through weathering of diverse plastics whereas the sphere type has limited uses sphere type primary microplastics are mostly used on land and then filtered into the sludge from industrial wastewater and sewage treatment plants after use liu et al 2019 large amounts of sewage and wastewater sludge have been dumped at the es a ocean dumping site reaching 5 59 million tons in 2005 mof 2020 and extremely high abundances of up to 130 000 particles kg d w were observed in the surface sediment from the edp area even after ocean dumping had been banned because there were no archived sludge dumping samples it was impossible to quantify the contribution of sludge dumping in this study however very high abundances of microplastics 22 700 220 000 particles kg were reported in sewage sludge li et al 2018 ren et al 2020 and very high removal rates 98 7 99 99 of microplastics were reported in sewage sludge in 31 korean wastewater treatment plants park et al 2020 indirectly supporting the study results in this study the spherical microplastics found in es and edp were ps and their appearances were identical fig s5 considering that spherical microplastics are not commonly detected in coastal shelf and deep waters of korea song et al 2018 eo et al 2021 these ps spheres were considered to have originated from the dumping process spherical microplastics may have been distributed throughout the es in two ways carried by surface or middle currents during dumping and distributed by bottom currents after sinking the model results showed that particles within dumping waste were dispersed throughout the es during ocean dumping fig 7b c most particles settled around the stations located in es a and their abundance decreased in the northwestern direction a similar distribution of spherical microplastics occurred in es fig s6 counter clockwise circulation occurs in the deep part of ulleung basin north of about 36 n park et al 2004 2010 2013 and the particles were dispersed to the east of the dumping site south of 36 n particles were affected by westward flow and were dispersed to the west a few particles were transported from the northwestern corner of the dumping site in that area the mean current is not eastward but strong eddy activity induces weak particle dispersion within es b the surface current bifurcates into two branches seo et al 2013 one branch flows northward along the korean coast and the other flows eastward carrying the particles released there once a particle settled to the bottom it did not move in the model but could be transported by bottom flow within the deeper part of the ulleung basin the mean bottom flow is less than 1 cm s senjyu et al 2005 which is too weak to transport typical microplastics average size 77 μm at edp that have settled to the bottom based on the shields parameter shields 1936 over the southern perimeter of the ulleung basin flows that are strong enough to move settled microplastics were observed senjyu and shin 2021 as the natural sedimentation rate of the ulleung basin ranges from 0 06 to 0 2 cm y kim and park 2003 han and choi 2007 a typical microplastic would be buried within a few months at most at the dumping site the sedimentation rate was close to the maximum sedimentation rate 0 19 cm y as would the burial rate of settled microplastics strong storm events are not frequent enough to transport settled particles more than 10 km from the dumping site before burial these results indicate that the distribution of ps spheres in the es was mainly through surface and middle currents during ocean dumping rather than bottom currents after sinking the ps spheres in es can be used as an indicator of the dispersion of ocean dumping waste 4 4 microplastic pollution trends cores ys5 and es5 were sampled from the central part of each sea area to investigate overall microplastic pollution trends in the ys and es however based on analysis of surface sediments both stations are likely influenced by ocean dumping the sediment core es5 showed a similar trend to edp1 fig s7a b and spherical microplastics were observed in all sections of es5 since the 1960s fig 6 although no direct evidence was found in sediment core ys5 an influence of ocean dumping was observed in surface sediments suggesting that this area may also be affected by ocean dumping this impact complicates the identification of microplastic pollution trends representing each sea which was intended for two cores excluding spherical microplastics which clearly originate from ocean dumping the abundance of microplastics in es5 has decreased since the 1960s fig s7c the microplastic abundance in each section showed repeated increases and decreases in the range of 67 1153 particles kg d w surprisingly the highest abundance was observed at the bottom of the core excluding sphere type microplastics bioturbation or penetration through sediment pores näkki et al 2017 gebhardt and forster 2018 xue et al 2020 in the past might be responsible for the vertical transport of microplastics within the sediment column excluding the bottom the overall microplastic pollution tended to increase slightly over time analysis of core ys5 could not eliminate the possibility of an effect from ocean dumping but the abundance of microplastics tended to increase overall similar to es5 a trend of increasing microplastic pollution over time has been confirmed in recent research brandon et al 2019 li et al 2020 lin et al 2021 as world plastic production is steadily increasing plastic europe 2020 so too is microplastic pollution pelagic microplastics have been predicted to increase 4 fold by 2060 around the subtropical convergence zone isobe et al 2019 and 50 fold by 2100 in the world ocean everaert et al 2018 the amount of microplastic pollution is also expected to increase in the future 5 conclusion microplastic pollution was investigated in surface and core sediments at ocean dumping and non dumping sites located in continental shelf and deep sea areas of korea although ocean dumping ceased in 2015 the abundance of microplastics remained much higher at dumping sites than in surrounding areas this finding indicates that the ocean dumping site is an underwater hotspot and source of microplastics to seafloor sediments sediment cores from dumping sites showed that the historical trend of microplastic pollution reflects the amount of ocean dumping a large amount of spherical microplastics which appear to be dispersed through ocean dumping was found throughout es sediments ocean dumping acted as a source of microplastic which may remain hidden in sediment for a long time however microplastic pollution has gradually decreased since ocean dumping was banned and this means that microplastic pollution can be mitigated by restricting the source removal of microplastics that have already been created and dispersed into the environment is difficult therefore a proactive approach and intensive management of hotspots are essential management strategies for sources and hotspots are necessary to slow microplastic pollution in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16079,three ocean dumping sites located in the yellow sea ys and east sea es of south korea have accumulated terrestrial waste from 1988 to 2015 most of this waste comprised industrial wastewater and sewage sludge which are sources of microplastics in this study we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution and characteristics of microplastics in surface and core sediments of the ys south sea ss and es including at dumping sites ydp and edp the mean abundance of microplastics in surface sediments was ranked in order of edp 59 457 49 130 particles kg d w es 5 047 9 404 particles kg d w ydp 3 965 3 213 particles kg d w ss 314 488 particles kg d w and ys 288 400 particles kg d w edp and ydp showed about 14 and 12 fold higher microplastic abundances and more diverse polymer compositions than the es and ys respectively the historical trend of microplastic pollution in age dated core sediments from edp and ydp aligned well with the amount of historical ocean dumping as the level of ocean dumping has gradually reduced since 2006 and was finally banned in 2015 the microplastic abundance decreased accordingly interestingly spherical polystyrene ps primary microplastic was the dominant type in edp sediments 78 and other surface sediments in the es 52 more than 60 million tons of sewage and wastewater sludge were dumped at edp and extremely high abundances of up to 130 000 particles kg d w were observed in edp surface sediments ps primary microplastics were continuously present in the edp and es sediment cores in the dumping period and are suspected to have originated from industrial wastewater sludge the particle transportation model results showed that ps was dispersed throughout the es during ocean dumping in addition deep circulation can contribute to the dispersion of particles after sinking these results indicate that ocean dumping sites represent an underwater hotspot and source of microplastics in seafloor sediments keywords microplastics sediment core ocean dumping continental shelf deep sea 1 introduction microplastics are widely distributed in aquatic environments including freshwater coastal open ocean deep sea and polar regions woodall et al 2014 peeken et al 2018 song et al 2018 eo et al 2019 pan et al 2019 it has been estimated that approximately 6300 million metric tons of plastic waste was generated in 1950 2015 79 of which accumulated in landfills or the natural environment geyer et al 2017 due to its durability plastic is persistent in the environment over a long period but weathering occurs on its surface nanoplastics and microplastics have been produced through ultraviolet exposure and mechanical abrasion of plastics in laboratory experiments gigault et al 2016 song et al 2017 smaller plastics are biologically available to a wide range of organisms and lead to harmful physical and chemical effects at high exposure levels wright et al 2013 jang et al 2016 cho et al 2019 the seafloor is considered the final destination of microplastics in the marine environment woodal et al 2014 kanhai et al 2019 näkki et al 2019 microplastics have been found in sediments from coasts frias et al 2016 ling et al 2017 phuong et al 2018 the deep sea tekman et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 and even the mariana trench at depths greater than 10 000 m peng et al 2018 plastics that are less dense than seawater as well as those denser than seawater can reach the seafloor due to biological interactions kooi et al 2017 porter et al 2018 kvale et al 2020 microplastics in sediment can be ingested by benthic organisms causing adverse effects bour et al 2018 wang et al 2019 sfrisoet al 2020 as sediment can accumulate microplastics over a long period of time investigation of microplastics in sediment is useful for understanding the long term contamination status which reflects the characteristics of the area although seafloor sediment is a known sink for microplastics microplastic pollution in shelf and deep sea sediments has not yet been well addressed the yellow sea ys receives a large amount of plastic discharge from chinese rivers lebreton et al 2017 and has relatively high abundances of microplastics in the water and sediment zhao et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 the east sea es is a deep sea with its own circulation that is useful for investigating open ocean processes however information about microplastic pollution levels and characteristics in sediments of the eastern ys south sea ss and es is limited revealing the distribution and characteristics of microplastics in korean offshore sediments will provide useful information for understanding the distribution and fate of microplastics in continental shelf e g the eastern ys and ss and deep sea e g the es regions of the global ocean in particular three ocean dumping sites are located in the ys and es which have accommodated terrestrial waste from 1988 to 2015 dumping began with 5 5 105 m3 of waste in 1988 and reached a maximum amount of 9 9 106 m3 in 2005 mof 2020 most of the waste was comprised of sludge from industrial wastewater and sewage treatment works which are known sources of microplastics murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 thus investigation of whether the sediments at the dumping site are a hotspot or source of microplastics is needed ocean dumping has been banned but microplastic contamination can be expected due to the previous mass dumping over a long period however little research has been conducted on ocean dumping sites in korea and other countries despite sewage addition being discontinued for more than a decade dumping sites retained more microplastics than reference sites in the uk browne et al 2011 in this study we investigated the abundance and characteristics of microplastics larger than 20 μm in sediments of the ys and ss continental shelf areas as well as the es deep sea area including three dumping sites we tested the following hypotheses 1 the ys which receives vigorous riverine input from korea and china will have the highest abundance of microplastics and variety of polymer types among the three seas and 2 the abundance of microplastics in the sediment will be higher at dumping sites than in surrounding areas this study will provide baseline data on microplastic contamination in korean offshore sediments and contribute to the establishment of a global distribution map of microplastics the findings will provide useful information about microplastic contamination caused by ocean dumping 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the ys and ss form a semi enclosed continental shelf sea surrounded by the korean peninsula and china with a combined area of 380 000 km2 and average and maximum depths of 44 and 103 m respectively fig s1 the es is a deep sea area surrounded by korea japan and russia with a total area of 1070 000 km2 and average and maximum depths of 1361 and 4049 m respectively although the es is much smaller than a world ocean it is referred to as a miniature ocean because it has characteristics similar to those of open oceans dumping of terrestrial waste occurred from 1988 to 2015 at one site in the ys ys a and two sites in the es es a and es b ys a located approximately 200 km from land covers a total area of 3165 km2 es a 125 km from land and es b 63 km from land have total areas of 3700 and 1616 km2 respectively dumped materials include manure livestock wastewater sewage treatment wastewater and sludge dredged material and processed fishery products mof 2020 2 2 sampling of microplastics in surface and core sediments sediment samples were collected at eight non dumping sites and four dumping sites in the ys as well as five non dumping sites in the ss of korea from r v eardo in july and august 2018 fig 1 in july and august 2019 sediment samples from eight non dumping sites and seven dumping sites were sampled in the es from r v eardo sampling was conducted using a van veen grab in the ys and ss and a box corer in the es due to the greater depth of that sea approximately 250 ml of surface sediment from the top 2 cm was collected into a glass bottle using a stainless steel spoon single sediment cores were collected from non dumping and dumping sites in the ys ys5 and ydp2 and es es5 and edp1 each core was collected using a box corer with a polyvinyl chloride pvc core barrel gently inserted into the box core to minimize disturbance the diameter and length of the barrel were 12 4 cm and 35 cm respectively 2 3 core sectioning and dating the cores were cut using a core splitter at intervals of 1 cm until 10 cm from the top and at intervals of 2 cm thereafter core sediments from each section were transferred into 250 ml bottles then 1 g of oven dried 60 c sediments from each section was used for determination of 210pb activities using the alpha decay of its daughter nuclide 210po at the korea basic science institute the age of sediment at each depth was estimated from excess 210pb derived linear sedimentation rates for details see si 2 4 analysis of surface sediment samples the sediment in contact with the pvc core barrel was discarded to avoid contamination then 100 g of wet sediment sample was subsampled for further analysis to obtain the ratio of wet to dry sediment approximately 1 g of wet sediment was dried and weighed diluted lithium metatungstate lmt 1 6 g cm3 was poured into the sample beaker until the total volume was 200 ml and the wet sediment sample was stirred with a stainless steel spoon for 1 min after settling for 1 hour the supernatant was transferred to a 1 l glass beaker this process was repeated two more times the beaker was left for 24 h to allow particles in samples heavier than the lmt solution to settle the supernatant in the beaker was passed through a 20 µm metal sieve and washed with high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade water the particles on the sieve were transferred to a 250 ml glass beaker containing hplc grade water the water in the beaker was fully dried at 60 c in an oven organic matter in the samples was digested using 20 ml of 35 h2o2 and fe ii solution on a hot plate 60 c 180 rpm for 30 min after that the process of adding h2o2 every 30 min was repeated 3 5 times per sample the sediment was collected on a 20 µm metal sieve to remove the digestion solution and then washed with hplc grade water the sample was transferred into a 250 ml glass density separation funnel using lmt and allowed to settle for 24 h after settling the bottom layer was drained and the upper portion was filtered onto 5 µm polycarbonate filter paper using a vacuum pump based on the number of microplastics identified on the filter paper 12 5 100 of the total filtered area was randomly selected for examination all particles that appeared to be plastic within the selected range of the filter paper were identified using a fourier transform infrared ft ir microscope nicolet in10 thermo fisher scientific usa in attenuated total reflectance mode the spectrum was recorded through 16 scans in the spectral range of 675 4000 cm 1 2 5 analysis of core sediment samples after age dating 10 12 core sections were selected from each core to observe the historical trend of microplastic pollution over time table s1 for this analysis 50 g of wet sediment sample was subsampled and the ratio of wet to dry weight was measured using 1 g of wet sediment the experimental process was the same as that used for surface sediment analysis the quality control and blank sample test and statistical analyses are provided in the si 2 6 particle tracking model a lagrangian particle tracking model was used to investigate the effect of ocean dumping on the distribution pattern of microplastics on the seafloor the model was based on seo and park 2020 and seo et al 2020 but used three dimensional velocities without wind drift as follows x t δ t x t t t δ t u c x t τ w x t τ d τ r 2 k h δ t here x t is the position of a particle at time t and δ t is the time interval set to 10 min in this study the input data u c are horizontal ocean currents from the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom https www hycom org global ocean forecast system gofs 3 1 and w is the sinking velocity of particles in the water column as described below the input data were linearly interpolated to particle positions and model time steps r is a random number between 1 and 1 and k h is the horizontal diffusion coefficient adopted from the smagorinsky 1963 mixing scheme when the particle had reached the bottom depth it was considered completely settled we assumed that microplastic particles sank together with the dumped waste which consisted mainly of liquid and sludge thus the sinking rate of microplastic particles was determined by the sinking velocity of the waste the composition of the waste is unknown so we set the sinking velocity to 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 0 and 2 5 cm s which are within the range proposed by fry and butman 1991 note that the sinking velocity was greater than typical vertical velocities of ocean circulation so the effect of the latter process was ignored the deepest part of the study area in the ulleung basin of the east sea is about 2500 m in depth and approximately 58 29 14 10 3 and 1 day s would be required for waste to sink the bottom at the sinking velocities listed above respectively three dumping sites were investigated designated es a es b and ys a fig 1 at each dumping site particles were released at locations 0 05 apart in both the zonal and meridional directions with 510 178 and 510 release points in es a es b and ys a respectively a total of 13 million particles were released daily from january 1 2003 to december 31 2007 when two years after the volume of dumped waste was greatest individual particles were tracked until they reached the bottom the model results were averaged across all cases and expressed as the probability of settlement in each area 3 results 3 1 abundance and spatial distribution of microplastics in surface sediment the mean abundance of microplastics was ranked in order of edp 59 457 49 130 particles kg d w es 5047 9404 particles kg d w ydp 3965 3213 particles kg d w ss 314 488 particles kg d w and ys 288 400 particles kg d w the spatial distribution of microplastics is shown in fig 1 exceptionally high microplastic abundances in surface sediments were found at two dumping sites ys a and es a compared to the non dumping sites the abundances of microplastics at ydp and edp were about 12 and 14 fold higher than average levels in ys and es respectively and these differences were significant mann whitney u test p 0 05 relatively high abundances of microplastics were found at ys4 1200 particles kg d w and ys5 520 particles kg d w which are located on both sides of the dumping site ys a similarly in the es high abundances of microplastics were observed at es8 27 523 particles kg d w and es7 7686 particles kg d w which are located northwest of dumping site es a these stations contributed to the high mean abundance of microplastics in the es which was 1 3 fold higher than the mean abundance in ydp the highest abundance in the ss 1180 particles kg d w was detected at ss2 which is located near the coast 3 2 size shape and polymer composition of microplastics in surface sediment as microplastic size decreased the abundance of microplastics increased in es and edp samples fig s2 in the ys ss and ydp a similar tendency was observed but the abundance of microplastics decreased again in the 20 50 μm size bin the percentage of microplastics less than 300 μm in size was greater than 90 in ys 93 0 es 93 3 and edp 96 8 and 70 in ss 77 7 and ydp 75 8 the peak size range was 20 50 μm in es 43 6 and edp 56 3 50 100 μm in ys 49 6 and ss 32 5 and 100 150 μm in ydp 21 9 the most abundant microplastic shape was spherical in es 51 6 and edp 77 8 followed by fragments fig 2 among 1741 spherical microplastics counted in sediments from es and edp all except 5 were polystyrene ps therefore ps was dominant in edp 80 2 and the es 53 fig 3 and table s2 polypropylene pp 21 8 and polyester pes 11 each accounted for more than 10 of microplastics in the es the fragment type was dominant in the ys 78 6 ydp 68 6 and ss 57 6 followed by fibers spherical microplastics were absent from the ss the polymer composition of ss was 29 0 pes 21 1 pp 14 9 polyethylene pe 7 polyacrylate copolymers and 5 3 poly acrylate styrene pp accounted for 42 1 of microplastics in the ys followed by acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs 12 9 pe 6 3 and ps 5 at ydp ps 18 3 was dominant followed by abs 13 6 pes 12 4 polyacrylate copolymers 10 3 polyamide pa 9 3 pp 7 7 pvc 6 2 and pe 5 5 other polymers not named here accounted for less than 5 of all microplastics 3 3 temporal distribution of microplastics in core sediments the sedimentation rates estimated from 210pb excess were 0 37 0 09 0 33 and 0 19 cm y for sediment cores from ys5 es5 ydp2 and edp1 respectively the analyzed depths and corresponding sediment ages are listed in table s1 the microplastic abundances in ys5 and es5 showed a repeating pattern of increases and decreases with an overall increasing trend over time fig s3 abundances increased rapidly after the 2000s and in core es5 decreased in the top layer the abundance of microplastics in each core section is presented as an average value across a sediment interval of 1 2 cm because 1 cm of sediment represented 3 and 5 years in ydp2 and edp1 respectively the amount of dumping at ys a and es a was averaged across a period corresponding to the assessed depth mof 2020 the amount of ocean dumping gradually increased until the 2000s and then decreased fig 4 the maximum amounts dumped were 2 4 million tons at ys a in 2001 and 4 4 million tons at es a in 2006 until the 1980s the abundance of microplastic was less than 1000 particles kg d w and abundance increased gradually from bottom to top in cores ydp2 and edp1 microplastic abundance increased rapidly to more than 10 000 particles kg d w in the mid 2000s and decreased thereafter a correlation was found between the microplastic distribution in core sediments and amount of ocean dumping for edp1 pearson correlation p 0 05 but not ydp2 the highest microplastic abundances were observed for ys5 in 2018 2933 particles kg d w es5 in 2002 4603 particles kg d w ydp2 in 2007 40 340 particles kg d w and edp1 in 2006 123 984 particles kg d w the lowest abundances of microplastics were found at the bottoms of all cores except ydp2 3 4 size shape and polymer composition of microplastics in core sediments the numbers of microplastic polymer types tended to increase from the bottom to top of all he sediment cores the most abundant polymer was pp in ys5 47 and es5 39 pes in ydp2 43 6 and ps in edp1 66 1 fig 5 fragments accounted for 69 1 of particles in ys5 followed by fibers 30 9 fig 6 a ydp2 showed large proportions of fragment 55 4 and fiber 42 2 while few spheres 2 4 were found fig 6b es5 showed the highest proportion of fragments prior to 1957 71 7 but spheres have accounted for a large proportion since 1968 57 4 fig 6c spheres were dominant at all depths in edp1 62 9 fig 6d approximately 99 7 of spheres found in surface sediments of the es were ps 3 5 distribution pattern of microplastics based on model estimation in all cases of the lagrangian particle tracking modeling the abundances of settled particles at the dumping sites were high fig 7 particles were released evenly across the dumping sites and the abundances did not exhibit notable spatial patterns within dumping sites particle dispersion patterns were determined by both ocean currents and the depths of the dumping sites dumping site ys a is about 80 m in depth and the smallest amount of particles was found outside of the dumping site using lagrangian particle model prediction fig 7a es b at about 150 m in depth is deeper than ys a and particles were dispersed further fig 7c around the depth of es a the effect of ocean currents on the dispersion of settled particle is most apparent fig 7b particles with slower sinking velocities are affected more the model results were compared with the observations of the abundance of spherical microplastic which was thought to have originated from the dumping site from the observed result at ys a the abundance of spherical microplastic outside the dumping site was 0 11 1 of that in ydp4 which had the maximum abundance of spherical microplastic within the dumping site the modeled particles were limited to the dumping site and reproduced the restricted dispersion of particles outside the ys a dumping site well in depth comparison was made for es a where sufficient observation data were obtained fig 8 a the correlation between the model and observed distribution patterns is about 0 87 more specifically the changes in abundance of microplastics away from the center of the dumping site along sampling locations edp4 edp3 es8 es7 and es4 were compared fig 8b both the observations and model show similar attenuation rates in es b there was only one sampling station and there was insufficient observational data to compare with the model 4 discussion 4 1 seafloor as a repository of sedimentary microplastics the abundance of microplastics is 17 6 and 12 6 fold significantly higher kruskal wallis test p 0 05 in the es than in ys and ss respectively thus hypothesis 1 the ys which receives vigorous riverine input from korea and china will have the highest abundance of microplastics and variety of polymer types among the three seas was rejected in this study as spherical primary microplastics were generally observed in the es surface sediments surveyed the entire es appears to have been affected by ocean dumping discussed in section 4 3 in particular es5 es7 and es8 which showed exceptionally high microplastic abundances were likely more directly affected by ocean dumping than other areas similarly relatively high abundances of microplastics were observed at ys4 and ys5 located on the eastern and western sides of dumping site ys a and spherical primary microplastics considered evidence of ocean dumping were found only at these two stations in the ys excluding three sites in the es and two in the ys which showed exceptionally high abundances of microplastics due to the strong influence of ocean dumping the mean abundance of microplastics in surface sediments of the three seas offshore of korea was 357 283 particles kg d w it was an order of magnitude higher than the values reported in the baltic sea zobkov and esiukova 2017 gulf of biscay phuong et al 2018 and bering sea chukchi sea shelf mu et al 2019 the western pacific ocean zhang et al 2020 and tyrrhenian sea cannas et al 2017 showed ranges of microplastic abundance similar to those in the present study the range of abundances in this study is lower than in deep sea studies conducted at the hausgarten observatory tekman et al 2020 and mariana trench peng et al 2018 the abundance of microplastics in the eastern ys in this study fell between those reported in the southern 72 particles kg d w and northern 124 particles kg d w ys zhao et al 2018 sediment is considered a temporary repository of sunken microplastics comparing the sediment microplastic abundances in this study with levels in waters at the same stations eo et al 2021 surface sediment had approximately 6700 7500 and 3400 fold using the same units of particles m3 higher abundance than the surface middle and bottom waters respectively assuming a 1 m2 column with a surface water layer 1 m water column layer 22 2215 m surface sediment layer 0 02 m and deep sediment layer below 0 02 m the proportion of the total amount of microplastics in each layer was estimated based on the abundance of microplastics in core sediment of ys5 and es5 about 50 of the total amount of microplastics in sediment were present in the top 2 cm of the sediment therefore it was assumed that the same amount of microplastics in the surface sediment were present in the deep sediment the microplastic distribution was 0 7 1 3 in the surface water 69 1 24 5 in the water column 15 1 12 2 in the surface sediment and 15 1 12 2 in the deep sediment fig s4 the range of microplastic proportion in the total sediment was 9 3 84 4 average 38 2 25 9 in the continental shelf region ys and ss and 0 2 41 8 average 17 3 15 5 in the deep sea region es this difference is due to the large volume of the water column in the offshore region using the same calculation for the nakdong river sediment accounted for 83 4 of microplastics in a 1 m2 square column with water depth of 8 4 m eo et al 2019 these results indicate that microplastics accumulate strongly in seafloor sediments and the sediment can be considered a repository of sunken microplastics 4 2 underwater hidden microplastic hotspots since dumping began at es a a rapid increase and decrease in the amount of dumping at that site before and after 2006 was observed which aligned with the trend in the abundance of microplastics in core edp1 fig 4a the pattern of increasing and decreasing dumping levels at ys a was similar to that of the abundance of microplastics at ydp2 with a time lag of 6 years fig 4b as a significant correlation was found between the microplastic distribution in edp1 core sediment and amount of ocean dumping at es a microplastics in that core may be directly affected by ocean dumping the abundance of microplastics in core ydp2 decreased with the decreasing amount of dumping until 2013 and then showed a slight increase in 2018 although no significant correlation was found it is unlikely that ocean dumping had no impact at ydp2 microplastic abundance exceeding 1000 particles kg was rarely observed in shelf or deep sea sedimentary environments e g bergmann et al 2017 peng et al 2018 tekman et al 2020 kane et al 2020 however most studies have reported microplastic abundances of less than 1000 particles kg in these environments harris 2020 the exceptionally high abundances of microplastics in sediments at edp and ydp are rare in marine environments without a specific source similarly browne et al 2011 reported that the abundance of microplastics was significantly higher in sediments at sewage disposal sites than at reference sites in the uk hypothesis 2 the abundance of microplastics in the sediment will be higher at dumping sites than in surrounding areas was accepted these results demonstrate that the abundance of microplastics was affected by ocean dumping in the particle transportation model results particles were released evenly across dumping site ys a and the model showed no notable spatial structure fig 7a the observed pattern suggests that within the dumping site the area closer to the coast was preferred for dumping the model did not reproduce the high abundance at station ys4 located east of the dumping site tides which are not considered in hycom could have contributed to this discrepancy the high observed abundances of microplastics at stations edp1 edp4 were due to waste dumping at es a fig 7b the high microplastic abundance at edp7 located on the southern edge of dumping site es b was due to the waste dumping at that site fig 7c note that the amount of waste dumped at es b is about 42 of the amount at es a and that edp7 is located at the upstream edge of the dumping site mof 2020 therefore the observed abundance was lower at edp7 than at stations within es a the high observed abundance of microplastics at es8 was due to westward flow from the dumping site along the edge of the ulleung basin es7 was affected by eddy driven dispersion of particles few particles reach north of 37 n and the observed numbers of microplastics were substantially lower at es1 and es2 than around the dumping sites microplastics occurred at es5 and es6 due to counterclockwise circulation within the deep ulleung basin according to the model microplastics within waste were dispersed throughout the es except in shallow coastal areas during ocean dumping therefore sources exist near es3 and they must originate from the land rather than ocean dumping stations ydp1 ydp4 are within the dumping site ys a and the abundances of microplastics are high in accordance with the model results along the eastern edge of the site the observed values were higher than the model estimates the impacts of ocean dumping have been investigated for numerous contaminants including microplastics high concentrations of alkylphenolic chemicals were found as a result of ocean dumping hong and shin 2009 and the time of heavy metal enrichment corresponded to the period of increasing ocean dumping kim et al 2009 however since the 2006 introduction of the rest year system and capping with dredged material at the ys a dumping site annual variations in metal concentrations have gradually decreased chung et al 2017 as ocean dumping was reduced in quantity beginning in 2006 and then banned in 2015 the microplastic abundance in the sediment core also gradually decreased with the reduction in dumping even if the input of plastics ceased microplastic pollution would persist for many years however this study demonstrated that ocean dumping was an obvious source of microplastics and that microplastic pollution in surface sediments at the dumping sites was mitigated by controlling its input sludge produced in wastewater treatment plants can be disposed of in landfills or reused as fertilizer but may cause secondary pollution of microplastics in the terrestrial environment jiang et al 2020 hou et al 2021 microplastics are introduced to surrounding soil through landfill leachate and increasing microplastic abundance in soil was observed after the reuse of fertilizer made from sludge corradini et al 2019 he et al 2019 these findings indicate that control of known sources of microplastics is essential 4 3 primary spherical microplastics an indicator of dispersion of ocean dumping waste spherical microplastics were found throughout the surface sediments of the es both ys a and es a were affected by ocean dumping but the microplastic shape and polymer compositions differed at ydp and edp since terrestrial waste from the western and eastern parts of south korea were dumped separately in ys a and es a respectively different types of waste were expected to be dumped at each site although the exact source has not been identified it was presumed that sludge dumped at es a contained large amounts of spherical microplastic except for the ps spheres fragments in shape and abs in the polymer were the most abundant types at both ydp and edp the abundance of spherical microplastics was 6 and 4 fold higher than that of non spherical microplastics at edp and es respectively in addition spherical microplastics were dominant in es5 core sediments after the 1960s and sections of edp1 although ocean dumping began in 1988 microplastics arising from dumping can be transported downward through bioturbation or with sediment pore water näkki et al 2017 gebhardt and forster 2018 spherical shape is representative of primary microplastics which are manufactured for applications such as cosmetics and personal care products curren et al 2020 determining the origin of fragment type microplastic is difficult as they are created through weathering of diverse plastics whereas the sphere type has limited uses sphere type primary microplastics are mostly used on land and then filtered into the sludge from industrial wastewater and sewage treatment plants after use liu et al 2019 large amounts of sewage and wastewater sludge have been dumped at the es a ocean dumping site reaching 5 59 million tons in 2005 mof 2020 and extremely high abundances of up to 130 000 particles kg d w were observed in the surface sediment from the edp area even after ocean dumping had been banned because there were no archived sludge dumping samples it was impossible to quantify the contribution of sludge dumping in this study however very high abundances of microplastics 22 700 220 000 particles kg were reported in sewage sludge li et al 2018 ren et al 2020 and very high removal rates 98 7 99 99 of microplastics were reported in sewage sludge in 31 korean wastewater treatment plants park et al 2020 indirectly supporting the study results in this study the spherical microplastics found in es and edp were ps and their appearances were identical fig s5 considering that spherical microplastics are not commonly detected in coastal shelf and deep waters of korea song et al 2018 eo et al 2021 these ps spheres were considered to have originated from the dumping process spherical microplastics may have been distributed throughout the es in two ways carried by surface or middle currents during dumping and distributed by bottom currents after sinking the model results showed that particles within dumping waste were dispersed throughout the es during ocean dumping fig 7b c most particles settled around the stations located in es a and their abundance decreased in the northwestern direction a similar distribution of spherical microplastics occurred in es fig s6 counter clockwise circulation occurs in the deep part of ulleung basin north of about 36 n park et al 2004 2010 2013 and the particles were dispersed to the east of the dumping site south of 36 n particles were affected by westward flow and were dispersed to the west a few particles were transported from the northwestern corner of the dumping site in that area the mean current is not eastward but strong eddy activity induces weak particle dispersion within es b the surface current bifurcates into two branches seo et al 2013 one branch flows northward along the korean coast and the other flows eastward carrying the particles released there once a particle settled to the bottom it did not move in the model but could be transported by bottom flow within the deeper part of the ulleung basin the mean bottom flow is less than 1 cm s senjyu et al 2005 which is too weak to transport typical microplastics average size 77 μm at edp that have settled to the bottom based on the shields parameter shields 1936 over the southern perimeter of the ulleung basin flows that are strong enough to move settled microplastics were observed senjyu and shin 2021 as the natural sedimentation rate of the ulleung basin ranges from 0 06 to 0 2 cm y kim and park 2003 han and choi 2007 a typical microplastic would be buried within a few months at most at the dumping site the sedimentation rate was close to the maximum sedimentation rate 0 19 cm y as would the burial rate of settled microplastics strong storm events are not frequent enough to transport settled particles more than 10 km from the dumping site before burial these results indicate that the distribution of ps spheres in the es was mainly through surface and middle currents during ocean dumping rather than bottom currents after sinking the ps spheres in es can be used as an indicator of the dispersion of ocean dumping waste 4 4 microplastic pollution trends cores ys5 and es5 were sampled from the central part of each sea area to investigate overall microplastic pollution trends in the ys and es however based on analysis of surface sediments both stations are likely influenced by ocean dumping the sediment core es5 showed a similar trend to edp1 fig s7a b and spherical microplastics were observed in all sections of es5 since the 1960s fig 6 although no direct evidence was found in sediment core ys5 an influence of ocean dumping was observed in surface sediments suggesting that this area may also be affected by ocean dumping this impact complicates the identification of microplastic pollution trends representing each sea which was intended for two cores excluding spherical microplastics which clearly originate from ocean dumping the abundance of microplastics in es5 has decreased since the 1960s fig s7c the microplastic abundance in each section showed repeated increases and decreases in the range of 67 1153 particles kg d w surprisingly the highest abundance was observed at the bottom of the core excluding sphere type microplastics bioturbation or penetration through sediment pores näkki et al 2017 gebhardt and forster 2018 xue et al 2020 in the past might be responsible for the vertical transport of microplastics within the sediment column excluding the bottom the overall microplastic pollution tended to increase slightly over time analysis of core ys5 could not eliminate the possibility of an effect from ocean dumping but the abundance of microplastics tended to increase overall similar to es5 a trend of increasing microplastic pollution over time has been confirmed in recent research brandon et al 2019 li et al 2020 lin et al 2021 as world plastic production is steadily increasing plastic europe 2020 so too is microplastic pollution pelagic microplastics have been predicted to increase 4 fold by 2060 around the subtropical convergence zone isobe et al 2019 and 50 fold by 2100 in the world ocean everaert et al 2018 the amount of microplastic pollution is also expected to increase in the future 5 conclusion microplastic pollution was investigated in surface and core sediments at ocean dumping and non dumping sites located in continental shelf and deep sea areas of korea although ocean dumping ceased in 2015 the abundance of microplastics remained much higher at dumping sites than in surrounding areas this finding indicates that the ocean dumping site is an underwater hotspot and source of microplastics to seafloor sediments sediment cores from dumping sites showed that the historical trend of microplastic pollution reflects the amount of ocean dumping a large amount of spherical microplastics which appear to be dispersed through ocean dumping was found throughout es sediments ocean dumping acted as a source of microplastic which may remain hidden in sediment for a long time however microplastic pollution has gradually decreased since ocean dumping was banned and this means that microplastic pollution can be mitigated by restricting the source removal of microplastics that have already been created and dispersed into the environment is difficult therefore a proactive approach and intensive management of hotspots are essential management strategies for sources and hotspots are necessary to slow microplastic pollution in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
