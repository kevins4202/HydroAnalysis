12660,in this study the mechanisms and key factors of p nitrophenol pnp removal by biochar bc and sulfide double modified nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi were systematically investigated the results showed that the residence time of the hydrothermal carbonization of waste bamboo chopsticks was the key factor affecting the removal of pnp by nzvi bc the biochar derived from waste bamboo chopsticks prepared at a hydrothermal temperature of 240 c for 1 h was the most suitable nzvi loading material the hydrophobicity of the biochar had a greater impact on s nzvi bc biochar effectively alleviated the agglomeration of nzvi and formed a miniature galvanic cell with nzvi to promote its corrosion the effective reducing agents in the s nzvi bc system were fe0 fe2 s2 and s2 2 and the system had stronger reducibility then nzvi the reaction rate of s nzvi bc for pnp removal was 2 6 times higher than that of nzvi in addition the double modification of nzni reduced the energy barrier of the pnp removal reaction and alleviated the surface passivation of nzvi the apparent activation energy of the reaction under anaerobic conditions after sulfidation treatment was reduced by 23 7 while the pnp removal efficiency increased by 8 under aerobic conditions density function theory dft calculations revealed that pnp was more easily adsorbed and participated in the reaction on the surface of the sulfide shell layer than oxidized shell layer this work confirms that biochar loading and surface sulfidation can enhance the reactivity and stability of nzvi graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords p nitrophenol nanoscale zero valent iron biochar sulfidation waste bamboo chopsticks data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction p nitrophenol pnp is an important multifunctional fine chemical intermediate that is often used as a raw material in industries such as pesticide medicine printing and dyeing and rubber manufacturing 1 moreover pnp can be absorbed into the human body and poses carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic risks 2 unfortunately pnp is difficult to degrade naturally in the environment and it is one of the typical compounds that are most difficult to degrade directly 3 thus pnp is regarded as a priority environmental pollutant in many countries and it is of great importance to develop methods to remove pnp quickly efficiently and safely from the environment the pnp removal methods include adsorption biological processes photocatalysis and advanced oxidation among these the adsorption method is the most feasible for engineering applications however saturated adsorbents are considered a hazardous waste and are prone to secondary contamination owing to the high toxicity of pnp the high concentration of pnp formed after the enrichment of pnp by the adsorbent is unfavorable to the biodegradation process 4 in addition the nitro group in pnp is an electron absorbing group which makes it is relatively difficult to degrade the pnp by conventional oxidation 5 previous studies have confirmed that pnp can be reduced to p aminophenol pap which is easily oxidized directly 6 8 many novel adsorbents such as metal organic frameworks 9 covalent organic frameworks 10 and metal oxide graphene based materials 11 are limited because of their complex synthesis processes and high costs 12 therefore innovation in advanced reducing materials and the practical value of engineering applications have led to new research directions for pnp degradation nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi which has the advantages of being abundant in raw materials environmental friendliness and a high reduction efficiency has become one of the most widely studied nanomaterials in the fields of water treatment soil remediation and hydrogen production 13 15 the nzvi particle size is 100 nm which gives it a considerable specific surface area and reactivity 16 it has been proven to reduce and remove various organic pollutants 17 18 heavy metals 19 21 and radioactive substances 22 23 however nzvi faces many problems and challenges in practical applications 24 first the surface of nzvi particles is easily oxidized to form oxide and hydroxide shells second the nzvi particle size is extremely small and the surface effect makes the particles easily agglomerate into large particles this significantly reduces the number of active reactive sites on the nzvi surface in recent years dispersion techniques and surface modifications have been used to improve nzvi and avoid these problems 25 to solve the agglomeration problem of nzvi polymer stabilizers and coating techniques have been used in some studies to disperse zero valent iron particles such as polyacrylamide 26 and carboxymethyl cellulose 27 although polymer stabilizers and coating techniques can weaken the agglomeration of nzvi to some extent they also block the active sites on the surface of nzvi and inhibit the diffusion of contaminants to its surface 28 carrier materials e g bentonite 29 clay 30 and carbon based materials 31 with their pore structures not only inhibit the aggregation of nzvi but also promote the interfacial mass transfer between liquid contaminants and the nzvi surface however the reactivity of nzvi bentonite and nzvi clay gradually decrease with the severe passivation of nzvi during the removal of contaminants 28 in recent years biochar bc has been shown to be a suitable support material for nzvi owing to its porous structure and surface functional groups 32 33 the appropriate pore volume and abundant surface functional groups of biochar can improve the stability and dispersion of nzvi 34 biochar loaded nzvi composites nzvi bc may show a significant improvement in performance compared to nzvi waste bamboo chopsticks a typical solid waste in urban environments with an annual waste volume reaching 1 66 million cubic meters 35 are mostly incinerated resulting in air pollution and the wastage of biomass resources 36 the reuse of waste bamboo chopsticks as a bioremediation material specifically as biochar in the field of environmental restoration not only achieves the recycling of solid waste and treating waste with waste but also reduces the production costs of activated carbon 37 microwave hydrothermal carbonization mhtc is a simpler more time saving and more efficient method for preparing biochar than conventional pyrolysis and has been extensively studied in recent years 38 recently surface modification techniques have been applied to enhance the dispersion and antioxidant capacity of nzvi particles modification of nzvi particles with sulfide compounds to form surface sulfide shells is environmentally friendly and technically acceptable for environmental remediation 39 sulfur ferrites have a higher affinity for pollutants and the generated electrons tend to pass to organic pollutant molecules rather than to water molecules which effectively improves electron utilization 40 in addition the fes formed by sulfidation treatment effectively alleviated the surface oxidation of nzvi and promoted electron transfer therefore s nzvi bc possesses excellent reduction activity and oxidation resistance and has the potential to be a high quality pollutant treatment material 40 however few studies have used waste bamboo chopsticks for nzvi technology and the effect of biochar hydrothermal conditions on the activity of nzvi has rarely been explored 41 42 the environmental variables and removal mechanism of s nzvi bc for pnp removal are yet to be studied 40 43 in this study a series of composite materials such as nzvi nzvi bc and s nzvi bc was prepared to remove pnp these were combined with bet xrd xps ftir and other characterizations and dft calculations to attempt to explain the removal mechanism of pnp by nzvi composites the specific objectives were to i explore the effects of nzvi modification methods biochar and sulfidation treatment on pnp removal performance ii explore the effects of key environmental factors such as the initial ph inorganic ions and dissolved oxygen do on pnp removal and evaluate the aging and reusability performance of the composites and iii explore the potential mechanism of pnp removal by dft calculations and characterizations such as by xps and xrd the ultimate goal was to develop an easily implemented cost effective and highly persistent pnp contamination remediation technology 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of biochar and s nzvi bc composites waste bamboo chopsticks obtained from jinan city shandong province china

reaction was complete then the solution was placed in a shaking bath at 25 c and shaken at 100 rpm for 10 h the resulting composites were washed three times with anaerobic water and ethanol respectively and vacuum dried at 60 c 2 2 pnp removal experiment batch experiments were performed in three necked flasks at room temperature here 0 25 g of s nzvi bc was added to 500 ml of anaerobic pnp solution at a concentration of 100 mg l with continuous stirring at 500 rpm continuous purging with n2 was performed to eliminate the interference of oxygen aerobic and anaerobic conditions were achieved by bubbling air and n2 respectively in the solution during the experiment 1 ml samples were taken at different time intervals and the concentration of pnp was measured in these at 398 nm

atoms adopted a 4 4 1 supercell and set a vacuum layer of 15 Ã¥ as the basic system due to the amorphous nature of the nzvi shell whose exact composition cannot be accurately known we adopted the traditional iron oxide surface model used in the classic textbook aquatic chemistry chemical equilibrium and rates in natural water this model was also adopted by li 47 et al the fes 001 surface was the most stable surface of fes so the fes 001 surface terminated by fe atoms of fe substrate was used to simulate the shell structure of s nzvi 48 the brillouin zone was sampled using a 5 5 1 k point

reaction can take place the smaller the adsorption energy means that the adsorption reaction is easier to occur 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of composition of s nzvi bc on pnp removal 3 1 1 biochar the main properties of waste bamboo chopsticks biochar including the yield ash content elemental composition specific surface area ssa average pore size aps etc are listed in table 1 as the hydrothermal temperature increased the bamboo biochar decreased from 61 42 wt to 45 17 wt which was attributed to the hydrolysis of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin in the biomass under high temperature and high pressure hydrothermal conditions it has been reported that the hydrolysis of lignin occurs over a wide temperature range 200 c the hydrolysis of cellulose starts in high pressure hot water around 225 c and the hydrolysis reaction of hemicellulose requires a higher temperature 49 cellulose and lignin undergo decarboxylation devolatilization and dehydration reactions to produce short chain organic compounds such as formic acid acetic acid and sugars 50 the increase in the hydrothermal temperature provides sufficient energy to break down organic macromolecules for the fragmentation and reorganization of highly reactive chemical bonds 51 the decline was particularly pronounced at temperatures 220 c whereas the trend slowed down above 220 c a similar phenomenon was observed during the mhtc of pig manure and green waste 52 53 when the residence time was extended from 0 5 h to 2 h the biochar yield also rapidly decreased followed by a slow decrease for example the yield of bc200 0 5 was 73 2 wt and the yield of the biochar decreased by 17 7 wt when the residence time was 1 h when the residence time was extended to 2 h the biochar yield decreased by 4 9 wt and the extension of the residence time had no significant effect on the biochar yield of biochar this was because the hydrolysis reactions of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin continued to occur as the residence time increased and all three decomposed rapidly the continued holding temperature had little effect on the biochar yield in other words when the hydrothermal temperature was determined a residence time of 1 h seemed to contribute to the decomposition of large organic molecules within the waste bamboo chopsticks from an industrial perspective a shorter residence time is beneficial for process efficiency and cost savings fig 1 a shows the weight loss curve obtained from the thermogravimetric analysis of the waste bamboo chopsticks the pyrolysis of most of the organic components was complete at 350 c the elemental analysis of the biochar is shown in table 1 with the increase in hydrothermal parameters the h c and o c ratios continued to decrease which indicated that the aromatization degree of the biochar bc continued to deepen higher aromaticity is beneficial for biochar and pollutant adsorption through Ï electrons 49 at the same time the n s and ash contents of the biochar are low low ash biochar has a lower risk of secondary pollution which means that the waste bamboo chopstick biochar prepared by mhtc may be a good environmental remediation agent the n2 adsorption desorption curves pore size distribution and sem images of the biochars are shown in fig 1 b d from the sem image it was observed that the surface of the waste bamboo chopstick biochar was loose and porous and the pore structure was rich the adsorption of pnp on the biochar surface was influenced by the pore structure which provided channels for the adsorbates to reach the active adsorption sites 54 meanwhile the pore structure can provide dispersion sites for nzvi reducing the interparticle attraction thereby reducing the agglomeration of nzvi and increasing its dispersion on the biochar carrier 55 the adsorption isotherm of the biochar exhibited a typical type iv isotherm with an obvious h3 hysteresis loop indicating a mesoporous structure the ssa of the waste bamboo chopstick biochar ranged from 2 49 m2 g to 16 28 m2 g and the aps ranged from 10 29 nm to 15 52 nm the ssa of the biochar increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature the biochar prepared at 240 c for 1 h had the largest ssa and the smallest aps previous studies have shown that the hydrothermal temperature during biochar preparation is closely related to the ssa 56 the biomass is hydrolyzed into small molecules during the hydrothermal process forming pores on the biochar surface and increasing the corresponding ssa excessive reaction temperature is detrimental to increasing the ssa 57 meanwhile at higher hydrothermal temperatures pores are easily created by the hydrolysis of organic matter in the biomass 58 therefore the pore volume of the biochar is also closely related to the bet surface area 59 the waste bamboo chopstick biochar prepared in this study had a larger ssa than previously reported pinecone biochar 56 and food waste biochar 60 the pore size of the biochar can inhibit the growth of nzvi particles 61 meaning that the nzvi bc240 1 material had the smallest nzvi particle size and strongest reactivity from the ftir spectra of the bamboo and bamboo biochar in fig 1 e f it was observed that the types and numbers of transmission peaks were almost the same for all samples indicating the absence of functional groups all the samples prepared at lower temperatures exhibited a low degree of carbonization the main peaks in the ftir spectrum were assigned as follows the peak at 3410 cm 1 was attributed to the oh stretching vibration in the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups the peaks at 2900 cm 1 and 1372 cm 1 represented the stretching vibration of the ch bond the peak at 1743 cm 1 was attributed to the co stretching vibration of acetyl in hemicellulose the peak at 1623 cm 1 was attributed to the vibration of the aromatic hydrocarbon backbone the peak at 1520 cm 1 corresponded to the aromatic cc double bond and the peaks between 1022 cm 1 and 1264 cm 1 indicated syringyl derivatives vibrations of the rings and co stretching in cellulose and hemicellulose 36 as shown from the ftir spectrum the intensity of the oh peak at 3410 cm 1 gradually weakened with increasing temperature and residence time which was caused by the dissociation of hydroxyl groups during dehydration and decarboxylation at this time there were fewer hydroxyl groups in the chemical structure of biochar which can enhance the hydrophobic properties of the biomass by reducing the number of binding sites between the biomass and water the later increasing trend of this peak was presumed to be related to the formation of 5 hydroxymethylfurfural hmf and biochar the peak at 1743 cm 1 also showed the same change which indicated the decomposition of acetyl in hemicellulose and the higher temperature accelerated the fragmentation reaction no significant change in the peak intensity was observed for the remaining peaks effect of biochar on pnp removal by nzvi bc composites the removal efficiency of pnp is shown in fig 2 the six materials nzvi bc180 2 nzvi bc200 2 nzvi bc220 2 nzvi bc240 0 5 nzvi bc240 1 nzvi bc240 2 were effective at removing pnp and the removal efficiency of pnp within 1 h was higher than 90 the material nzvi bc240 1 exhibited the highest pnp removal efficiency 99 in contrast nzvi bc240 0 5 and nzvi bc240 2 had the worst pnp removal efficiencies of 93 77 and 94 19 respectively the removal efficiencies of pnp by nzvi bc synthesized using bc180 2 bc200 2 and bc220 2 were 96 57 97 47 and 97 39 respectively in contrast the biochar prepared at different hydrothermal temperatures had little effect on the pnp removal ability of nzvi bc and the residence time was the key factor affecting the removal of pnp by nzvi bc biochar can remove pnp through pore filling partitioning hydrophobic interactions and Ï Ï interactions biochar prepared at higher hydrothermal parameters had higher aromaticity and its composite nzvi bc showed a higher removal capacity for pnp p nitrophenol is a polar organic compound containing a benzene ring and charge transfer occurs between the Ï electrons of the benzene ring and the adsorbent surface contributing to the adsorption of pnp 62 these results suggest that hydrophobic and Ï Ï interactions have a greater impact in the adsorption of pnp the compounds nzni bc240 0 5 and nzni bc240 2 had the lowest removal capacity among all the composites but the ssa of the biochar was not the lowest for these two materials the pnp removal efficiency was not linearly correlated with the surface area of the biochar suggesting that the functional groups and pore structure on the surface of the biochar have complex effects on the removal of pnp by nzni bc 3 1 2 nzvi bc mass ratio composites with different nzvi bc mass ratios were prepared to ensure the same nzvi mass for the composites with nzvi bc mass ratios of 0 1 1 3 1 1 3 1 and 1 0 the pnp removal efficiencies were 3 6 49 8 98 9 90 4 and 85 6 under the same conditions respectively fig 3 a it can be seen from fig 3 a that the removal efficiency of pnp by pure s nzvi was only 85 6 composites with a mass ratio of 1 1 achieved maximum pnp removal efficiency nearly 100 within 60 min at low mass ratios nzvi was dispersed on the surface and pores of the biochar it can react with functional groups on the surface of the biochar to form stable bonds which mitigates the agglomeration effects and releases more active sites in contrast previous research has suggested that there is a standard electrode potential difference between s nzvi and biochar so that the s nzvi anode and biochar cathode form a galvanic battery eqs 11 and 12 respectively 63 the electrons provided by reducing agents can be transferred to pollutants through galvanic cells composed of biochar and nzvi 3 11 fe 0 2 e fe 2 e Î¸ fe 2 fe 0 0 44 v 12 2 h 2 e 2 h h 2 e Î¸ h h 2 0 00 v in addition the material with a mass ratio of 0 1 was pure biochar the same mass as the 1 0 material which had a pnp removal efficiency of 4 5 within 60 min the pnp removal of nzvi bc at a 1 1 mass ratio was higher than that of nzvi and biochar alone indicating a strong synergy between nzvi and biochar therefore the nzvi bc mass ratio of 1 1 achieved the best pnp removal efficiency in this experiment the sem images of nzvi and nzvi bc are shown in fig 3 b d it was found that nzvi nanoparticles with diameters of 100 nm agglomerated into bulk or long chains their agglomeration was inhibited by loading on the biochar resulting in dispersed particles and short chain agglomeration however the agglomeration phenomenon did not improve when excess nzvi was loaded into the biochar which was also the reason for its weak pnp removal ability many nzvi particles were unevenly distributed on the biochar surface this was partly due to the limited number of active sites on the biochar surface and partly due to the extremely small particle size of nzvi particles the surface effects and magnetic properties made the binding force between the particles greater than their own weight which made the nzvi particles still prone to agglomeration the reduction of active sites of aggregated nzvi particles negatively affects the removal performance of the composite 3 1 3 s fe molar ratio during the preparation of s nzvi the s fe molar ratio in the solution determined the degree of sulfurization of the solid four materials with different s fe molar ratios were prepared and pnp removal experiments were carried out under the same conditions the results are shown in fig 4 a pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models were used to fit the kinetic data fig 4 b c a comparison of the two kinetic models was carried out using the akaike information criterion aic which is a method to compare different models on a given outcome and was initially developed by the japanese statistician hirotugu akaike 64 the best model according to the aic is defined as the one with the lowest value when comparing models fitted to the same data 65 as shown in table 2 the r 2 of the pseudo second order kinetics was greater than that of the pseudo first order kinetic model and both aic and aic c were less than that of the pseudo first order kinetic model which indicated that the pseudo second order kinetic model fit the data better than the pseudo first order reaction model meaning that the rate limiting process of pnp removal by s nzvi bc was a chemical process involving chemisorption and electron exchange between pnp and s nzvi bc 24 66 the removal efficiency of s nzvi bc with different s fe molar ratios reached approximately 98 within 60 min however the reaction rates were quite different the reaction rate k 2 of pnp removal by the nzvi bc material was only 1 45 10 3 g mg min and the time required to reach the 90 removal efficiency was t90 30 min as the s fe molar ratio increased k 2 also increased when the molar ratio of s fe was 0 15 k 2 reached a maximum value of 2 72 10 3 g mg min t90 13 min and the reaction rate increased by 255 7 compared with nzvi the sulfidation treatment greatly enhanced the rate of pnp removal this is because s nzvi had higher hydrophobicity and a higher charge transfer rate than nzvi making it easier for pnp to adsorb onto the reaction surface previous studies have shown that sulfides can also improve the electron selectivity of nzvi 67 inhibit the hydrogen evolution rate and improve the electron utilization rate however when the s fe molar ratio was further increased to 0 2 the reaction rate decreased and k 2 decreased to 2 57 10 3 g mg min this finding is consistent with the conclusion of previous studies when the s content in the material is too high a large amount of fe0 is lost to form fesx which blocks the active sites on the surface of nzvi and reduces its corrosion rate resulting in a decrease in the removal rate of pollutants in addition fes2 produces a higher bandgap 0 95 ev which may slow electron transfer 12 the s nzvi bc and nzvi bc samples were characterized by tem combined with eds the nzvi in fig 5 a consisted of chain like or spherical aggregates in the range of 10 100 nm and had a distinct core shell structure the s nzvi particles exhibited different particle sizes and morphologies fig 5 b and their sheet like shells were significantly different from the spherical shells of nzvi dong 68 also observed the sheet like structure of s nzvi and suggested that the abundant sheet like structure could improve the ssa of s nzvi in addition the agglomeration of the s nzvi particles was slightly improved because the presence of the sulfide shell weakened the magnetic attraction between the particles sulfur was found in the sheet like shell in the tem image of s nzvi by eds fig 5 c it was speculated that the main component of the flaky shell of the s nzvi particles was fesx the tafel diagram fig 5 d showed that the corrosion potential of s nzvi bc 0 45 v was higher than that of nzvi bc 0 24 v indicating that sulfidation can effectively increase the reduction potential of nzvi in addition the corrosion current density of s nzvi bc 27 64 Î¼a cm2 was higher than that of nzvi bc 25 73 Î¼a cm2 indicating that s nzvi bc was more easily corroded than nzvi bc this proves the high electron transport rate of the sulfide layer which was favorable for the participation of s nzvi in the reaction 3 2 effects of environmental factors on the removal of pnp by s nzvi bc 3 2 1 initial ph the effect of the initial ph on the removal of pnp was investigated as shown in fig 6 a b the pnp removal efficiency was the lowest in the alkaline system with a ph of 9 where the pnp removal efficiency was only 85 within 60 min and the reaction rate constant k 2 was 0 96 10 3 g mg min this was because fe2 was generated by the reaction of fe0 combined with oh under alkaline conditions forming an oxide hydroxide passivation layer on the surface of the s nzvi bc particles which prevented contact between pnp and the reaction site when the ph was 5 and 7 the pnp removal efficiency reached approximately 98 within 60 min and k 2 was 3 12 10 3 g mg min and 2 52 10 3 g mg min respectively this was because s nzvi at a low ph corroded to generate more reducing hydrogen h and fe2 and the passivation layer on the iron surface did not easily form providing a large number of active sites for the degradation reaction thus promoting the removal of pnp this was consistent with the results obtained by other modifications of nzvi for pnp removal in addition according to eq 12 more h generated more h with strong reducibility which in turn promoted the degradation of pnp however when the ph continued to decrease to 3 0 the pnp removal efficiency and reaction rate constant decreased this was because the low ph accelerated the corrosion of the s nzvi particles whereas the high concentration of h consumed a large amount of electrons to generate h2 which greatly reduced the electron utilization efficiency 69 the generated h2 accumulated on the particle surface and covered the active sites hindering their contact with pnp as shown in fig 7 tiny bubbles started to appear on the solid surface after 2 min gc analysis of the reactor headspace after 60 min was performed and the characteristic peak of h2 appeared the appearance of o2 was due to the interference of air during the operation which indicated that fe0 at low ph was indeed corroded by h to produce h2 as shown in fig 6 c the ph increased from initial values of 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 to 7 5 8 6 8 7 and 9 5 respectively the initial ph increase to 7 5 under extremely acidic conditions may be attributed to the oh released by the rapid corrosion of the s nzvi bc composite as shown in eq 13 there was no significant change in the ph under mildly acidic or alkaline conditions 13 fe 0 2 h 2 o fe 2 h 2 2 oh 3 2 2 initial pnp concentration and inorganic ions the removal of pnp by s nzvi bc was a heterogeneous reaction and the initial concentration of pnp provided an important driving force for the reaction figs 8 a b shows that when the initial pnp concentration increased from 100 mg l to 300 mg l the pnp removal efficiency decreased from 97 1 to 41 4 and the reaction rate constant decreased from 2 26 10 3 g mg min to 0 99 10 3 g mg min it is known that the reduction of pnp mainly occurs when it is adsorbed on the surface of s nzvi particles and because the active sites on the surface of s nzvi bc are limited excess pnp cannot be degraded simultaneously simultaneously the competition of pnp on the s nzvi bc surface also reduced its degradation efficiency the nonlinear langmuir adsorption isotherm developed by considering all active sites on the composite surface was used to calculate the maximum adsorption capacity of the composites fig 8 c for the pnp removal experiments the langmuir isotherm model had an r 2 value of 0 97 using the langmuir isotherm adsorption model the maximum theoretical removal of pnp by the s nzni composite was calculated to be 551 12 mg g which is close to the experimental measured value of 567 66 mg g the reactivity of s nzni bc particles during environmental remediation is greatly affected by water quality or soil physicochemical properties inorganic anions which are typical natural inorganic substances play an important role in both the adsorption and electron transfer processes the pnp removal efficiency after 1 h in systems containing different concentrations of cl so4 2 hco3 and no3 was investigated fig 8 d the pnp removal efficiency in the blank system was 97 1 when the system contained 1 10 and 100 mm cl or so4 2 the pnp removal efficiency was improved to a certain extent because nacl and na2so4 were strong electrolytes that promoted electron transfer from nzni to the pollutants accelerated nzni corrosion and promoted the reduction of pnp when the system contained the same concentrations of hco3 the pnp removal efficiencies were 96 9 94 1 and 92 1 respectively although other studies have shown that hco3 can accelerate the early corrosion of fe fe2 forms a passivation layer on the fe particles after a prolonged reaction in a high concentration hco3 system covering the reaction sites and inhibiting the mass transfer process 70 the pnp removal efficiencies were 96 7 95 2 and 89 4 respectively when the system contained the same levels of no3 showing a significant negative effect this is because no3 ions can be reduced to nitrite and ammonia by nzni because the s nzni bc particles preferentially reduce no3 71 there was competition between pnp and the no3 ions for the reduction sites and the rapid formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the nanoparticles reduced the pnp removal efficiency 3 2 3 dissolved oxygen in practical applications the presence of do in water accelerates the oxidation of nzvi and affects its service life 72 to verify whether the sulfide layer could alleviate the oxidation of nzvi by do the effect of do on the removal of pnp from s nzvi bc was investigated fig 9 a b shows that nzvi was very sensitive to the presence of do under n2 conditions the pnp degradation efficiency reached 99 within 60 min k 2 0 89 10 3 g mg min under aerobic conditions the pnp removal efficiency was only 70 k 2 0 79 10 3 g mg min a decrease of 29 under aerobic conditions the pnp removal efficiency of s nzvi bc increased by 8 compared with that of nzvi bc and the reaction rate improved accordingly the improvement in oxidation resistance was attributed to the dual modification of biochar and sulfidation first the stability of the nzvi was greatly improved after complexation with biochar functional groups and only a thinner oxide layer could be formed 73 second the pore structure of the biochar restricted the diffusion of oxygen and inhibited the contact between nzni and oxygen third the acidic and reducing functional groups on the surface of the biochar also provided anti oxidation fourth the formation of the sulfide layer played a positive role in protecting the nzvi core in contrast fe0 activated do to generate strongly oxidizing oh eqs 14 17 74 as shown in fig 9 c the toc removal efficiencies under aerobic conditions in the nzvi bc and s nzvi bc systems were 8 and 18 respectively the higher toc removal efficiency of s nzvi bc was attributed to the high hydrophobicity and high electron selectivity of its sulfide shell this further demonstrates that s nzvi bc may be a good environmental remediation agent 14 o 2 fe 0 2 h fe 2 h 2 o 2 15 fe s fe 2 o 2 fe s fe 3 o 2 16 fe 2 o 2 2 h fe 3 h 2 o 2 17 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 3 3 apparent activation energy of pnp removal process the apparent activation energy of the pnp removal process is an important thermodynamic parameter because k obs in the pseudo first order kinetic model is the true reaction kinetic constant in the inverse of time the pseudo first order kinetic model was used to fit the pnp removal process and calculate the reaction kinetic constants for nzvi bc and s nzvi bc at 15 25 and 35 c under anaerobic and aerobic conditions 8 75 simultaneously the apparent activation energy of the pnp removal process was determined by the arrhenius equation with the results shown in fig 10 the apparent activation energies of nzni bc for pnp removal under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were 47 46 kj mol and 66 71 kj mol respectively the apparent activation energies of s nzni bc for pnp removal under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were 36 19 kj mol and 51 48 kj mol respectively it was found that there was a higher reaction rate and lower apparent activation energy under anaerobic conditions indicating that the formation of passivation layer was very unfavorable for the continuous progression of the reaction which was consistent with the previous conclusion the apparent activation energies of nzvi bc and s nzvi bc for pnp removal in different atmospheres were compared the apparent activation energy of nzvi bc under aerobic conditions was 66 71 kj mol whereas that of s nzvi bc was 51 48 kj mol a comparison between the two revealed that sulfidation reduced the apparent activation energy of the pnp removal reaction under aerobic conditions by 22 83 the same comparison showed that sulfidation treatment reduced the apparent activation energy under anaerobic conditions by 23 74 this indicates that sulfidation treatment can weaken the surface interactions of pnp and reduce the reaction barrier comparing the apparent activation energy of the same material under different aeration conditions revealed that the apparent activation energy of nzvi bc increased by 19 25 kj mol in the presence of oxygen whereas that of s nzvi bc increased by only 15 29 kj mol this was consistent with the previous conclusion that the sulfide layer plays a positive role in mitigating the oxidation of nzvi this is because s nzvi is more prone to corrosion is more hydrophobic and has a higher charge transfer rate than nzvi in contrast fesx has a higher electronegativity 5 02 ev for fes and 5 39 ev for fes2 than that of fe0 4 04 ev and a better electron conductivity with a lower band gap 0 10 ev for fes and 0 95 ev for fes2 than that of iron oxides which ranged from 2 20 to 2 60 ev thus the fesx layer could facilitate the transfer of electrons from fe0 to the chemisorbed pnp 76 in addition fesx is a strong reductant that can reduce pnp thus s nzvi has a higher corrosion potential than nzvi meaning that corrosion is more likely to occur and release electrons contrastingly previous studies found that the adsorption of water molecules was inhibited on the surface of nzvi after sulfidation treatment 77 which improved the electron selectivity of nzvi suppressed the rate of hydrogen precipitation and improved electron utilization the above results showed that sulfidation treatment has obvious advantages in removing pnp from nzvi 3 4 aging and reuse experiment to further explore whether biochar loading and surface sulfidation can slow down the surface passivation caused by nzvi corrosion aging experiments with nzni nzni bc and s nzni bc were conducted in anaerobic water for different times the effect of the aging time on pnp removal was measured and is shown in fig 11 a the pnp removal efficiency of bare nzvi decreased to 81 after ten days of aging and only 52 of the pnp removal ability remained after 30 d of aging this showed that the surface passivation of nzni caused by corrosion was very serious and the lifetime of nzni was very low the pnp removal efficiencies of nzni bc and s nzni bc after 10 d of aging were 88 and 90 respectively these two materials were similar and both were higher than nzvi indicating that the use of biochar loading and surface sulfidation treatment can improve the anti aging properties of nzvi after 30 d of aging the pnp removal capacity of s nzni bc was 78 which was much higher than that of nzni bc 68 this was due to the existence of the sulfide layer which can delay surface passivation due to corrosion and further prolong its life stability and reusability are important factors when evaluating the catalyst performance five consecutive pnp removal experiments were performed on s nzni bc fig 11 b and it was found that the pnp removal ability of s nzni bc remained at 50 after four cycles the reason for the decreased removal efficiency was that the accumulation of pnp and its degradation products on the surface of s nzvi bc and the passivation layer hindered the electron transfer and mass transfer processes these results suggest that s nzvi bc is a promising material for highly stable pnp removal 3 5 removal mechanism of pnp 3 5 1 characterization the degradation products of pnp were measured by gc ms after 10 min of the reaction fig 12 a as expected the characteristic peak of pnp appeared at 16 47 min and the characteristic peak of p aminophenol was formed by the reduction of pnp at 12 94 min this finding was consistent with the results of previous studies 6 in addition the characteristic peak of p benzoquinone a typical oxidation product appeared at 7 22 min indicating that there was an oxidation reaction during the reduction of pnp by s nzvi bc under anaerobic conditions this may be attributed to the strong oxidation of oh generated by the fe3 and fe2 activated h2o eqs 18 and 19 6 18 fe 3 h 2 o fe 2 oh h 19 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh fig 12 b shows the xrd patterns of nzni nzni bc s nzni bc and post reaction s nzni bc the main peak of nzvi appeared at 2Î¸ 44 8 which was attributed to the fe 110 crystal plane with better crystallinity after nzvi was loaded onto the biochar the characteristic peak of the c 002 crystal plane appeared at 2Î¸ 22 7 in the nzni bc spectrum the characteristic peak intensity of fe0 in s nzni bc became weaker which was attributed to the shielding effect of fes formed after sulfidation treatment on the surface observation of the s nzni bc spectrum after the reaction revealed that the characteristic peaks of fe0 disappeared and the characteristic peaks of feooh and fe3o4 appeared this indicated that fe0 participated in the reaction and the surface of the s nzni particles was completely covered by a mixed shell composed of feooh and fe3o4 after the reaction the surface elements and contents of nzni bc s nzni bc and post reaction s nzni bc were analyzed by xps the fe2p spectrum in fig 12 c shows that the characteristic peak of fe0 appears near 707 1 ev in the nzni bc and s nzni bc samples and the fe0 content after sulfidation treatment decreased from 4 to 2 6 this shows that nzvi was well prepared and its surface was not fully vulcanized the result was consistent with the conclusion drawn from the xrd results both samples showed characteristic peaks of fe2 710 5 and 724 2 ev and fe3 713 3 and 727 5 ev which were due to the inevitable oxidation of nzni during the preparation process to form shell layers that are considered to be feooh and fe3o4 78 the characteristic peaks of iron oxides were not observed in the xrd pattern because of their low iron oxide content and poor crystallinity after the reaction the characteristic peak of fe0 on the surface of s nzni bc disappeared and the fe2 content decreased from 71 7 to 39 5 indicating that the surface of nzvi was oxidized and fe2o3 was dominant which was consistent with the conclusion obtained by the xrd results comparing the s2p spectra of s nzni bc before and after the reaction fig 1 d it was found that the characteristic peaks at 161 8 163 4 and 168 1 ev before the reaction belonged to s2 s2 2 and so4 2 respectively and their content ratio was s2 s2 2 so4 2 4 83 indicating that the ferric sulfides at this time were fes and fes2 after the reaction the contents of s2 and s2 2 decreased and the content of so4 2 increased greatly s2 s2 2 so4 2 0 28 which indicated that ferric sulfide had been converted into iron sulfate in other words fe2 s2 and s2 2 also played a role in removing pnp making fe0 more reducible 3 5 2 dft calculation after the calculation figs s1 s3 and tables s1 s2 it was found that the most stable adsorption configuration of pnp on the fe 110 surface was the lb 30 2 configuration fig 13 a b which is a strong chemical adsorption to gain insight into the interfacial adsorption of pnp on nzvi shells the adsorption energies and transferred charges of pnps on fe 110 iron oxide shells and fes shells were compared fig 13 c when nzvi was exposed to fe0 the adsorption energy of pnp was 90 53 kcal mol mentioned above and the transfer charge amount was 0 59 e which is a strong chemical adsorption however during the preparation of nzvi feo was inevitably oxidized by do or h2o to form an amorphous iron oxide shell wang 79 proposed that the oxide shell formation sequence of nzvi was feo fe3o4 fe2o3 and feooh however the adsorption energy of pnp on the feooh surface was only 17 98 kcal mol and the transfer charge amount was 0 11 e which is a very weak chemical adsorption the feooh is a non conducting layer with a bandgap of 2 3 ev and few electrons can penetrate the outer feooh layer while fes has a specific electron transfer ability and a lower bandgap 0 1 ev and it has a higher electron transport efficiency the adsorption energy of pnp on the fes surface was 145 95 kcal mol and the transfer charge amount was 0 66 e which is a very strong chemical adsorption therefore s nzvi has obvious advantages in removing pnp it can more easily adsorb pnp and transfer electrons quickly to allow pnp to participate in the reaction 3 5 3 synergistic mechanism of pnp removal by s nzvi bc the removal of pnp was the combined result of the adsorption of biochar redox and enhanced electron transfer mechanisms of the s nzvi particles and based on the experimental results a pathway for the removal of pnp by s nzvi bc first the shell layer around the s nzvi core reacted with the biochar surface functional groups to form stable bonds thereby reducing the agglomeration of s nzvi owing to the aromaticity of the biochar the adsorption of pnp and contact of s nzvi with pnp were promoted through hydrophobic interactions and Ï Ï interactions the enhanced adsorption of pnp on the biochar made its reduction possible in contrast the fesx shell layer had higher hydrophobicity and a higher charge transfer rate which made it easier for pnp to adsorb onto the reaction surface and participate in the reaction quickly it can be preliminarily inferred that the pathway for s nzvi bc to remove pnp under anaerobic conditions involved several steps 1 pnp molecules were adsorbed onto the s nzvi bc surface 2 s nzvi had two pathways for the release of electrons by corrosion on the one hand nzvi had a higher reduction potential after sulfidation treatment and was more prone to corrosion the fe0 and sulfur ions s2 and s2 2 released a large number of electrons on the other hand a large number of micro galvanic cells were formed between the s nzvi and biochar which promoted the corrosion of nzni the h or h 2o in solution obtained electrons to generate more reducible h eqs 10 and 11 the pnp adsorbed on the s nzvi or biochar surface gained electrons and was reduced to pap with the participation of h in addition the sulfide layer suppressed the h to h2 transition and improved the electron utilization efficiency simultaneously the production of p benzoquinone was observed which was attributed to the strong oxidizing oh generated by fe3 and fe2 activated h2o eqs 18 and 19 3 the reaction intermediates or reaction products were desorbed from the surface of s nzvi bc in conclusion pnp removal using s nzvi bc involved physical adsorption and chemical redox reactions electrochemistry the enhanced activity of s nzvi bc was mainly attributed to accelerated fe0 corrosion by the micro galvanic cells and sulfide layer of s nzvi bc 4 applications and prospects nitro organic pollutants in the environment are of great concern and pnp has been considered a priority environmental pollutant in many countries nzvi is one of the most widely used materials for the removal of pnp however nzvi is prone to oxidation and agglomeration in practical applications many studies have focused on enhancing the stability and reactivity of nzvi the results of this study show that sulfidation and biochar modification can significantly improve the performance of nzvi for pnp removal s nzvi bc combines the advantages of s nzvi and biochar which provide a cost effective method for the removal of pnp from wastewater in addition to being a promising material for pnp removal from wastewater s nzvi bc may also be used for in situ or ex situ remediation of contaminated soil on the other hand the study of s nzvi bc in medical dye and heavy metal wastewater treatment industrial and continuous flow experiments deserve to be launched to solve the unexpected problems of s nzvi bc technology in commercialization and in real environment 5 conclusions a series of modified nzvi materials were prepared and static removal experiments of pnp were performed the hydrophobicity and Ï Ï interactions of the biochar surface had the greatest impact on the pnp removal ability biochar could effectively alleviate the agglomeration of nzni and form a miniature galvanic cell with nzvi to promote the corrosion of nzvi surface sulfidation treatment not only improved the pnp removal efficiency and reaction rate but also delayed the occurrence of surface passivation double modification reduced the energy barrier of the pnp removal reaction and maintained the stability of the particles in water the effective reducing agents for pnp in the s nzvi bc system were fe0 fe2 s2 and s2 2 the dft calculations revealed that pnp is more easily adsorbed and participates in the reaction on the surface of the sulfide shell declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

12660,in this study the mechanisms and key factors of p nitrophenol pnp removal by biochar bc and sulfide double modified nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi were systematically investigated the results showed that the residence time of the hydrothermal carbonization of waste bamboo chopsticks was the key factor affecting the removal of pnp by nzvi bc the biochar derived from waste bamboo chopsticks prepared at a hydrothermal temperature of 240 c for 1 h was the most suitable nzvi loading material the hydrophobicity of the biochar had a greater impact on s nzvi bc biochar effectively alleviated the agglomeration of nzvi and formed a miniature galvanic cell with nzvi to promote its corrosion the effective reducing agents in the s nzvi bc system were fe0 fe2 s2 and s2 2 and the system had stronger reducibility then nzvi the reaction rate of s nzvi bc for pnp removal was 2 6 times higher than that of nzvi in addition the double modification of nzni reduced the energy barrier of the pnp removal reaction and alleviated the surface passivation of nzvi the apparent activation energy of the reaction under anaerobic conditions after sulfidation treatment was reduced by 23 7 while the pnp removal efficiency increased by 8 under aerobic conditions density function theory dft calculations revealed that pnp was more easily adsorbed and participated in the reaction on the surface of the sulfide shell layer than oxidized shell layer this work confirms that biochar loading and surface sulfidation can enhance the reactivity and stability of nzvi graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords p nitrophenol nanoscale zero valent iron biochar sulfidation waste bamboo chopsticks data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction p nitrophenol pnp is an important multifunctional fine chemical intermediate that is often used as a raw material in industries such as pesticide medicine printing and dyeing and rubber manufacturing 1 moreover pnp can be absorbed into the human body and poses carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic risks 2 unfortunately pnp is difficult to degrade naturally in the environment and it is one of the typical compounds that are most difficult to degrade directly 3 thus pnp is regarded as a priority environmental pollutant in many countries and it is of great importance to develop methods to remove pnp quickly efficiently and safely from the environment the pnp removal methods include adsorption biological processes photocatalysis and advanced oxidation among these the adsorption method is the most feasible for engineering applications however saturated adsorbents are considered a hazardous waste and are prone to secondary contamination owing to the high toxicity of pnp the high concentration of pnp formed after the enrichment of pnp by the adsorbent is unfavorable to the biodegradation process 4 in addition the nitro group in pnp is an electron absorbing group which makes it is relatively difficult to degrade the pnp by conventional oxidation 5 previous studies have confirmed that pnp can be reduced to p aminophenol pap which is easily oxidized directly 6 8 many novel adsorbents such as metal organic frameworks 9 covalent organic frameworks 10 and metal oxide graphene based materials 11 are limited because of their complex synthesis processes and high costs 12 therefore innovation in advanced reducing materials and the practical value of engineering applications have led to new research directions for pnp degradation nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi which has the advantages of being abundant in raw materials environmental friendliness and a high reduction efficiency has become one of the most widely studied nanomaterials in the fields of water treatment soil remediation and hydrogen production 13 15 the nzvi particle size is 100 nm which gives it a considerable specific surface area and reactivity 16 it has been proven to reduce and remove various organic pollutants 17 18 heavy metals 19 21 and radioactive substances 22 23 however nzvi faces many problems and challenges in practical applications 24 first the surface of nzvi particles is easily oxidized to form oxide and hydroxide shells second the nzvi particle size is extremely small and the surface effect makes the particles easily agglomerate into large particles this significantly reduces the number of active reactive sites on the nzvi surface in recent years dispersion techniques and surface modifications have been used to improve nzvi and avoid these problems 25 to solve the agglomeration problem of nzvi polymer stabilizers and coating techniques have been used in some studies to disperse zero valent iron particles such as polyacrylamide 26 and carboxymethyl cellulose 27 although polymer stabilizers and coating techniques can weaken the agglomeration of nzvi to some extent they also block the active sites on the surface of nzvi and inhibit the diffusion of contaminants to its surface 28 carrier materials e g bentonite 29 clay 30 and carbon based materials 31 with their pore structures not only inhibit the aggregation of nzvi but also promote the interfacial mass transfer between liquid contaminants and the nzvi surface however the reactivity of nzvi bentonite and nzvi clay gradually decrease with the severe passivation of nzvi during the removal of contaminants 28 in recent years biochar bc has been shown to be a suitable support material for nzvi owing to its porous structure and surface functional groups 32 33 the appropriate pore volume and abundant surface functional groups of biochar can improve the stability and dispersion of nzvi 34 biochar loaded nzvi composites nzvi bc may show a significant improvement in performance compared to nzvi waste bamboo chopsticks a typical solid waste in urban environments with an annual waste volume reaching 1 66 million cubic meters 35 are mostly incinerated resulting in air pollution and the wastage of biomass resources 36 the reuse of waste bamboo chopsticks as a bioremediation material specifically as biochar in the field of environmental restoration not only achieves the recycling of solid waste and treating waste with waste but also reduces the production costs of activated carbon 37 microwave hydrothermal carbonization mhtc is a simpler more time saving and more efficient method for preparing biochar than conventional pyrolysis and has been extensively studied in recent years 38 recently surface modification techniques have been applied to enhance the dispersion and antioxidant capacity of nzvi particles modification of nzvi particles with sulfide compounds to form surface sulfide shells is environmentally friendly and technically acceptable for environmental remediation 39 sulfur ferrites have a higher affinity for pollutants and the generated electrons tend to pass to organic pollutant molecules rather than to water molecules which effectively improves electron utilization 40 in addition the fes formed by sulfidation treatment effectively alleviated the surface oxidation of nzvi and promoted electron transfer therefore s nzvi bc possesses excellent reduction activity and oxidation resistance and has the potential to be a high quality pollutant treatment material 40 however few studies have used waste bamboo chopsticks for nzvi technology and the effect of biochar hydrothermal conditions on the activity of nzvi has rarely been explored 41 42 the environmental variables and removal mechanism of s nzvi bc for pnp removal are yet to be studied 40 43 in this study a series of composite materials such as nzvi nzvi bc and s nzvi bc was prepared to remove pnp these were combined with bet xrd xps ftir and other characterizations and dft calculations to attempt to explain the removal mechanism of pnp by nzvi composites the specific objectives were to i explore the effects of nzvi modification methods biochar and sulfidation treatment on pnp removal performance ii explore the effects of key environmental factors such as the initial ph inorganic ions and dissolved oxygen do on pnp removal and evaluate the aging and reusability performance of the composites and iii explore the potential mechanism of pnp removal by dft calculations and characterizations such as by xps and xrd the ultimate goal was to develop an easily implemented cost effective and highly persistent pnp contamination remediation technology 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of biochar and s nzvi bc composites waste bamboo chopsticks obtained from jinan city shandong province china

a mhtc test after filtering washing and drying the hydrothermal product was labeled as bc180 0 5 each experiment was repeated three times in parallel an improved method based on dong 44 and miroslav s

mixed solution anaerobic water anaerobic ethanol 3 2 and then 0 25 g of was mixed with the solution the mixture was ultrasonically shaken for one hour and then left to stand overnight an excess of nabh4 0 5 g was added dropwise to the mixed solution under anaerobic conditions stirring was continued until the reaction was complete then 0 16 g of na2s 9h2o was added dropwise and stirred until the reaction was complete then the solution was placed in a shaking bath at 25 c and shaken at 100 rpm for 10 h the resulting composites were washed three times with anaerobic water and ethanol respectively and vacuum dried at 60 c 2 2 pnp removal experiment batch experiments were performed in three necked flasks at room temperature here 0 25 g of s nzvi bc was added to 500 ml of anaerobic pnp solution at a concentration of 100 mg l with continuous stirring at 500 rpm continuous purging with n2 was performed to eliminate the interference of oxygen aerobic and anaerobic conditions were achieved by bubbling air and n2 respectively in the solution during the experiment 1 ml samples were taken at different time intervals and the concentration of pnp was measured in these at 398 nm using a uv spectrophotometer all experiments were performed in triplicate and the standard deviations are represented by error bars to further compare the stability of nzvi nzvi bc and s nzvi bc the aging effects on the three materials exposed to anaerobic water were tested at 1 5 10 20 and 30 days to investigate the reusability of s nzvi bc it was reacted with pnp for five cycles unless

atoms adopted a 4 4 1 supercell and set a vacuum layer of 15 Ã¥ as the basic system due to the amorphous nature of the nzvi shell whose exact composition cannot be accurately known we adopted the traditional iron oxide surface model used in the classic textbook aquatic chemistry chemical equilibrium and rates in natural water this model was also adopted by li 47 et al the fes 001 surface was the most stable surface of fes so the fes 001 surface terminated by fe atoms of fe substrate was used to simulate the shell structure of s nzvi 48 the brillouin zone was sampled using a 5 5 1 k point

reaction can take place the smaller the adsorption energy means that the adsorption reaction is easier to occur 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of composition of s nzvi bc on pnp removal 3 1 1 biochar the main properties of waste bamboo chopsticks biochar including the yield ash content elemental composition specific surface area ssa average pore size aps etc are listed in table 1 as the hydrothermal temperature increased the bamboo biochar decreased from 61 42 wt to 45 17 wt which was attributed to the hydrolysis of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin in the biomass under high temperature and high pressure hydrothermal conditions it has been reported that the hydrolysis of lignin occurs over a wide temperature range 200 c the hydrolysis of cellulose starts in high pressure hot water around 225 c and the hydrolysis reaction of hemicellulose requires a higher temperature 49 cellulose and lignin undergo decarboxylation devolatilization and dehydration reactions to produce short chain organic compounds such as formic acid acetic acid and sugars 50 the increase in the hydrothermal temperature provides sufficient energy to break down organic macromolecules for the fragmentation and reorganization of highly reactive chemical bonds 51 the decline was particularly pronounced at temperatures 220 c whereas the trend slowed down above 220 c a similar phenomenon was observed during the mhtc of pig manure and green waste 52 53 when the residence time was extended from 0 5 h to 2 h the biochar yield also rapidly decreased followed by a slow decrease for example the yield of bc200 0 5 was 73 2 wt and the yield of the biochar decreased by 17 7 wt when the residence time was 1 h when the residence time was extended to 2 h the biochar yield decreased by 4 9 wt and the extension of the residence time had no significant effect on the biochar yield of biochar this was because the hydrolysis reactions of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin continued to occur as the residence time increased and all three decomposed rapidly the continued holding temperature had little effect on the biochar yield in other words when the hydrothermal temperature was determined a residence time of 1 h seemed to contribute to the decomposition of large organic molecules within the waste bamboo chopsticks from an industrial perspective a shorter residence time is beneficial for process efficiency and cost savings fig 1 a shows the weight loss curve obtained from the thermogravimetric analysis of the waste bamboo chopsticks the pyrolysis of most of the organic components was complete at 350 c the elemental analysis of the biochar is shown in table 1 with the increase in hydrothermal parameters the h c and o c ratios continued to decrease which indicated that the aromatization degree of the biochar bc continued to deepen higher aromaticity is beneficial for biochar and pollutant adsorption through Ï electrons 49 at the same time the n s and ash contents of the biochar are low low ash biochar has a lower risk of secondary pollution which means that the waste bamboo chopstick biochar prepared by mhtc may be a good environmental remediation agent the n2 adsorption desorption curves pore size distribution and sem images of the biochars are shown in fig 1 b d from the sem image it was observed that the surface of the waste bamboo chopstick biochar was loose and porous and the pore structure was rich the adsorption of pnp on the biochar surface was influenced by the pore structure which provided channels for the adsorbates to reach the active adsorption sites 54 meanwhile the pore structure can provide dispersion sites for nzvi reducing the interparticle attraction thereby reducing the agglomeration of nzvi and increasing its dispersion on the biochar carrier 55 the adsorption isotherm of the biochar exhibited a typical type iv isotherm with an obvious h3 hysteresis loop indicating a mesoporous structure the ssa of the waste bamboo chopstick biochar ranged from 2 49 m2 g to 16 28 m2 g and the aps ranged from 10 29 nm to 15 52 nm the ssa of the biochar increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature the biochar prepared at 240 c for 1 h had the largest ssa and the smallest aps previous studies have shown that the hydrothermal temperature during biochar preparation is closely related to the ssa 56 the biomass is hydrolyzed into small molecules during the hydrothermal process forming pores on the biochar surface and increasing the corresponding ssa excessive reaction temperature is detrimental to increasing the ssa 57 meanwhile at higher hydrothermal temperatures pores are easily created by the hydrolysis of organic matter in the biomass 58 therefore the pore volume of the biochar is also closely related to the bet surface area 59 the waste bamboo chopstick biochar prepared in this study had a larger ssa than previously reported pinecone biochar 56 and food waste biochar 60 the pore size of the biochar can inhibit the growth of nzvi particles 61 meaning that the nzvi bc240 1 material had the smallest nzvi particle size and strongest reactivity from the ftir spectra of the bamboo and bamboo biochar in fig 1 e f it was observed that the types and numbers of transmission peaks were almost the same for all samples indicating the absence of functional groups all the samples prepared at lower temperatures exhibited a low degree of carbonization the main peaks in the ftir spectrum were assigned as follows the peak at 3410 cm 1 was attributed to the oh stretching vibration in the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups the peaks at 2900 cm 1 and 1372 cm 1 represented the stretching vibration of the ch bond the peak at 1743 cm 1 was attributed to the co stretching vibration of acetyl in hemicellulose the peak at 1623 cm 1 was attributed to the vibration of the aromatic hydrocarbon backbone the peak at 1520 cm 1 corresponded to the aromatic cc double bond and the peaks between 1022 cm 1 and 1264 cm 1 indicated syringyl derivatives vibrations of the rings and co stretching in cellulose and hemicellulose 36 as shown from the ftir spectrum the intensity of the oh peak at 3410 cm 1 gradually weakened with increasing temperature and residence time which was caused by the dissociation of hydroxyl groups during dehydration and decarboxylation at this time there were fewer hydroxyl groups in the chemical structure of biochar which can enhance the hydrophobic properties of the biomass by reducing the number of binding sites between the biomass and water the later increasing trend of this peak was presumed to be related to the formation of 5 hydroxymethylfurfural hmf and biochar the peak at 1743 cm 1 also showed the same change which indicated the decomposition of acetyl in hemicellulose and the higher temperature accelerated the fragmentation reaction no significant change in the peak intensity was observed for the remaining peaks effect of biochar on pnp removal by nzvi bc composites the removal efficiency of pnp is shown in fig 2 the six materials nzvi bc180 2 nzvi bc200 2 nzvi bc220 2 nzvi bc240 0 5 nzvi bc240 1 nzvi bc240 2 were effective at removing pnp and the removal efficiency of pnp within 1 h was higher than 90 the material nzvi bc240 1 exhibited the highest pnp removal efficiency 99 in contrast nzvi bc240 0 5 and nzvi bc240 2 had the worst pnp removal efficiencies of 93 77 and 94 19 respectively the removal efficiencies of pnp by nzvi bc synthesized using bc180 2 bc200 2 and bc220 2 were 96 57 97 47 and 97 39 respectively in contrast the biochar prepared at different hydrothermal temperatures had little effect on the pnp removal ability of nzvi bc and the residence time was the key factor affecting the removal of pnp by nzvi bc biochar can remove pnp through pore filling partitioning hydrophobic interactions and Ï Ï interactions biochar prepared at higher hydrothermal parameters had higher aromaticity and its composite nzvi bc showed a higher removal capacity for pnp p nitrophenol is a polar organic compound containing a benzene ring and charge transfer occurs between the Ï electrons of the benzene ring and the adsorbent surface contributing to the adsorption of pnp 62 these results suggest that hydrophobic and Ï Ï interactions have a greater impact in the adsorption of pnp the compounds nzni bc240 0 5 and nzni bc240 2 had the lowest removal capacity among all the composites but the ssa of the biochar was not the lowest for these two materials the pnp removal efficiency was not linearly correlated with the surface area of the biochar suggesting that the functional groups and pore structure on the surface of the biochar have complex effects on the removal of pnp by nzni bc 3 1 2 nzvi bc mass ratio composites with different nzvi bc mass ratios were prepared to ensure the same nzvi mass for the composites with nzvi bc mass ratios of 0 1 1 3 1 1 3 1 and 1 0 the pnp removal efficiencies were 3 6 49 8 98 9 90 4 and 85 6 under the same conditions respectively fig 3 a it can be seen from fig 3 a that the removal efficiency of pnp by pure s nzvi was only 85 6 composites with a mass ratio of 1 1 achieved maximum pnp removal efficiency nearly 100 within 60 min at low mass ratios nzvi was dispersed on the surface and pores of the biochar it can react with functional groups on the surface of the biochar to form stable bonds which mitigates the agglomeration effects and releases more active sites in contrast previous research has suggested that there is a standard electrode potential difference between s nzvi and biochar so that the s nzvi anode and biochar cathode form a galvanic battery eqs 11 and 12 respectively 63 the electrons provided by reducing agents can be transferred to pollutants through galvanic cells composed of biochar and nzvi 3 11 fe 0 2 e fe 2 e Î¸ fe 2 fe 0 0 44 v 12 2 h 2 e 2 h h 2 e Î¸ h h 2 0 00 v in addition the material with a mass ratio of 0 1 was pure biochar the same mass as the 1 0 material which had a pnp removal efficiency of 4 5 within 60 min the pnp removal of nzvi bc at a 1 1 mass ratio was higher than that of nzvi and biochar alone indicating a strong synergy between nzvi and biochar therefore the nzvi bc mass ratio of 1 1 achieved the best pnp removal efficiency in this experiment the sem images of nzvi and nzvi bc are shown in fig 3 b d it was found that nzvi nanoparticles with diameters of 100 nm agglomerated into bulk or long chains their agglomeration was inhibited by loading on the biochar resulting in dispersed particles and short chain agglomeration however the agglomeration phenomenon did not improve when excess nzvi was loaded into the biochar which was also the reason for its weak pnp removal ability many nzvi particles were unevenly distributed on the biochar surface this was partly due to the limited number of active sites on the biochar surface and partly due to the extremely small particle size of nzvi particles the surface effects and magnetic properties made the binding force between the particles greater than their own weight which made the nzvi particles still prone to agglomeration the reduction of active sites of aggregated nzvi particles negatively affects the removal performance of the composite 3 1 3 s fe molar ratio during the preparation of s nzvi the s fe molar ratio in the solution determined the degree of sulfurization of the solid four materials with different s fe molar ratios were prepared and pnp removal experiments were carried out under the same conditions the results are shown in fig 4 a pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models were used to fit the kinetic data fig 4 b c a comparison of the two kinetic models was carried out using the akaike information criterion aic which is a method to compare different models on a given outcome and was initially developed by the japanese statistician hirotugu akaike 64 the best model according to the aic is defined as the one with the lowest value when comparing models fitted to the same data 65 as shown in table 2 the r 2 of the pseudo second order kinetics was greater than that of the pseudo first order kinetic model and both aic and aic c were less than that of the pseudo first order kinetic model which indicated that the pseudo second order kinetic model fit the data better than the pseudo first order reaction model meaning that the rate limiting process of pnp removal by s nzvi bc was a chemical process involving chemisorption and electron exchange between pnp and s nzvi bc 24 66 the removal efficiency of s nzvi bc with different s fe molar ratios reached approximately 98 within 60 min however the reaction rates were quite different the reaction rate k 2 of pnp removal by the nzvi bc material was only 1 45 10 3 g mg min and the time required to reach the 90 removal efficiency was t90 30 min as the s fe molar ratio increased k 2 also increased when the molar ratio of s fe was 0 15 k 2 reached a maximum value of 2 72 10 3 g mg min t90 13 min and the reaction rate increased by 255 7 compared with nzvi the sulfidation treatment greatly enhanced the rate of pnp removal this is because s nzvi had higher hydrophobicity and a higher charge transfer rate than nzvi making it easier for pnp to adsorb onto the reaction surface previous studies have shown that sulfides can also improve the electron selectivity of nzvi 67 inhibit the hydrogen evolution rate and improve the electron utilization rate however when the s fe molar ratio was further increased to 0 2 the reaction rate decreased and k 2 decreased to 2 57 10 3 g mg min this finding is consistent with the conclusion of previous studies when the s content in the material is too high a large amount of fe0 is lost to form fesx which blocks the active sites on the surface of nzvi and reduces its corrosion rate resulting in a decrease in the removal rate of pollutants in addition fes2 produces a higher bandgap 0 95 ev which may slow electron transfer 12 the s nzvi bc and nzvi bc samples were characterized by tem combined with eds the nzvi in fig 5 a consisted of chain like or spherical aggregates in the range of 10 100 nm and had a distinct core shell structure the s nzvi particles exhibited different particle sizes and morphologies fig 5 b and their sheet like shells were significantly different from the spherical shells of nzvi dong 68 also observed the sheet like structure of s nzvi and suggested that the abundant sheet like structure could improve the ssa of s nzvi in addition the agglomeration of the s nzvi particles was slightly improved because the presence of the sulfide shell weakened the magnetic attraction between the particles sulfur was found in the sheet like shell in the tem image of s nzvi by eds fig 5 c it was speculated that the main component of the flaky shell of the s nzvi particles was fesx the tafel diagram fig 5 d showed that the corrosion potential of s nzvi bc 0 45 v was higher than that of nzvi bc 0 24 v indicating that sulfidation can effectively increase the reduction potential of nzvi in addition the corrosion current density of s nzvi bc 27 64 Î¼a cm2 was higher than that of nzvi bc 25 73 Î¼a cm2 indicating that s nzvi bc was more easily corroded than nzvi bc this proves the high electron transport rate of the sulfide layer which was favorable for the participation of s nzvi in the reaction 3 2 effects of environmental factors on the removal of pnp by s nzvi bc 3 2 1 initial ph the effect of the initial ph on the removal of pnp was investigated as shown in fig 6 a b the pnp removal efficiency was the lowest in the alkaline system with a ph of 9 where the pnp removal efficiency was only 85 within 60 min and the reaction rate constant k 2 was 0 96 10 3 g mg min this was because fe2 was generated by the reaction of fe0 combined with oh under alkaline conditions forming an oxide hydroxide passivation layer on the surface of the s nzvi bc particles which prevented contact between pnp and the reaction site when the ph was 5 and 7 the pnp removal efficiency reached approximately 98 within 60 min and k 2 was 3 12 10 3 g mg min and 2 52 10 3 g mg min respectively this was because s nzvi at a low ph corroded to generate more reducing hydrogen h and fe2 and the passivation layer on the iron surface did not easily form providing a large number of active sites for the degradation reaction thus promoting the removal of pnp this was consistent with the results obtained by other modifications of nzvi for pnp removal in addition according to eq 12 more h generated more h with strong reducibility which in turn promoted the degradation of pnp however when the ph continued to decrease to 3 0 the pnp removal efficiency and reaction rate constant decreased this was because the low ph accelerated the corrosion of the s nzvi particles whereas the high concentration of h consumed a large amount of electrons to generate h2 which greatly reduced the electron utilization efficiency 69 the generated h2 accumulated on the particle surface and covered the active sites hindering their contact with pnp as shown in fig 7 tiny bubbles started to appear on the solid surface after 2 min gc analysis of the reactor headspace after 60 min was performed and the characteristic peak of h2 appeared the appearance of o2 was due to the interference of air during the operation which indicated that fe0 at low ph was indeed corroded by h to produce h2 as shown in fig 6 c the ph increased from initial values of 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 to 7 5 8 6 8 7 and 9 5 respectively the initial ph increase to 7 5 under extremely acidic conditions may be attributed to the oh released by the rapid corrosion of the s nzvi bc composite as shown in eq 13 there was no significant change in the ph under mildly acidic or alkaline conditions 13 fe 0 2 h 2 o fe 2 h 2 2 oh 3 2 2 initial pnp concentration and inorganic ions the removal of pnp by s nzvi bc was a heterogeneous reaction and the initial concentration of pnp provided an important driving force for the reaction figs 8 a b shows that when the initial pnp concentration increased from 100 mg l to 300 mg l the pnp removal efficiency decreased from 97 1 to 41 4 and the reaction rate constant decreased from 2 26 10 3 g mg min to 0 99 10 3 g mg min it is known that the reduction of pnp mainly occurs when it is adsorbed on the surface of s nzvi particles and because the active sites on the surface of s nzvi bc are limited excess pnp cannot be degraded simultaneously simultaneously the competition of pnp on the s nzvi bc surface also reduced its degradation efficiency the nonlinear langmuir adsorption isotherm developed by considering all active sites on the composite surface was used to calculate the maximum adsorption capacity of the composites fig 8 c for the pnp removal experiments the langmuir isotherm model had an r 2 value of 0 97 using the langmuir isotherm adsorption model the maximum theoretical removal of pnp by the s nzni composite was calculated to be 551 12 mg g which is close to the experimental measured value of 567 66 mg g the reactivity of s nzni bc particles during environmental remediation is greatly affected by water quality or soil physicochemical properties inorganic anions which are typical natural inorganic substances play an important role in both the adsorption and electron transfer processes the pnp removal efficiency after 1 h in systems containing different concentrations of cl so4 2 hco3 and no3 was investigated fig 8 d the pnp removal efficiency in the blank system was 97 1 when the system contained 1 10 and 100 mm cl or so4 2 the pnp removal efficiency was improved to a certain extent because nacl and na2so4 were strong electrolytes that promoted electron transfer from nzni to the pollutants accelerated nzni corrosion and promoted the reduction of pnp when the system contained the same concentrations of hco3 the pnp removal efficiencies were 96 9 94 1 and 92 1 respectively although other studies have shown that hco3 can accelerate the early corrosion of fe fe2 forms a passivation layer on the fe particles after a prolonged reaction in a high concentration hco3 system covering the reaction sites and inhibiting the mass transfer process 70 the pnp removal efficiencies were 96 7 95 2 and 89 4 respectively when the system contained the same levels of no3 showing a significant negative effect this is because no3 ions can be reduced to nitrite and ammonia by nzni because the s nzni bc particles preferentially reduce no3 71 there was competition between pnp and the no3 ions for the reduction sites and the rapid formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the nanoparticles reduced the pnp removal efficiency 3 2 3 dissolved oxygen in practical applications the presence of do in water accelerates the oxidation of nzvi and affects its service life 72 to verify whether the sulfide layer could alleviate the oxidation of nzvi by do the effect of do on the removal of pnp from s nzvi bc was investigated fig 9 a b shows that nzvi was very sensitive to the presence of do under n2 conditions the pnp degradation efficiency reached 99 within 60 min k 2 0 89 10 3 g mg min under aerobic conditions the pnp removal efficiency was only 70 k 2 0 79 10 3 g mg min a decrease of 29 under aerobic conditions the pnp removal efficiency of s nzvi bc increased by 8 compared with that of nzvi bc and the reaction rate improved accordingly the improvement in oxidation resistance was attributed to the dual modification of biochar and sulfidation first the stability of the nzvi was greatly improved after complexation with biochar functional groups and only a thinner oxide layer could be formed 73 second the pore structure of the biochar restricted the diffusion of oxygen and inhibited the contact between nzni and oxygen third the acidic and reducing functional groups on the surface of the biochar also provided anti oxidation fourth the formation of the sulfide layer played a positive role in protecting the nzvi core in contrast fe0 activated do to generate strongly oxidizing oh eqs 14 17 74 as shown in fig 9 c the toc removal efficiencies under aerobic conditions in the nzvi bc and s nzvi bc systems were 8 and 18 respectively the higher toc removal efficiency of s nzvi bc was attributed to the high hydrophobicity and high electron selectivity of its sulfide shell this further demonstrates that s nzvi bc may be a good environmental remediation agent 14 o 2 fe 0 2 h fe 2 h 2 o 2 15 fe s fe 2 o 2 fe s fe 3 o 2 16 fe 2 o 2 2 h fe 3 h 2 o 2 17 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 3 3 apparent activation energy of pnp removal process the apparent activation energy of the pnp removal process is an important thermodynamic parameter because k obs in the pseudo first order kinetic model is the true reaction kinetic constant in the inverse of time the pseudo first order kinetic model was used to fit the pnp removal process and calculate the reaction kinetic constants for nzvi bc and s nzvi bc at 15 25 and 35 c under anaerobic and aerobic conditions 8 75 simultaneously the apparent activation energy of the pnp removal process was determined by the arrhenius equation with the results shown in fig 10 the apparent activation energies of nzni bc for pnp removal under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were 47 46 kj mol and 66 71 kj mol respectively the apparent activation energies of s nzni bc for pnp removal under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were 36 19 kj mol and 51 48 kj mol respectively it was found that there was a higher reaction rate and lower apparent activation energy under anaerobic conditions indicating that the formation of passivation layer was very unfavorable for the continuous progression of the reaction which was consistent with the previous conclusion the apparent activation energies of nzvi bc and s nzvi bc for pnp removal in different atmospheres were compared the apparent activation energy of nzvi bc under aerobic conditions was 66 71 kj mol whereas that of s nzvi bc was 51 48 kj mol a comparison between the two revealed that sulfidation reduced the apparent activation energy of the pnp removal reaction under aerobic conditions by 22 83 the same comparison showed that sulfidation treatment reduced the apparent activation energy under anaerobic conditions by 23 74 this indicates that sulfidation treatment can weaken the surface interactions of pnp and reduce the reaction barrier comparing the apparent activation energy of the same material under different aeration conditions revealed that the apparent activation energy of nzvi bc increased by 19 25 kj mol in the presence of oxygen whereas that of s nzvi bc increased by only 15 29 kj mol this was consistent with the previous conclusion that the sulfide layer plays a positive role in mitigating the oxidation of nzvi this is because s nzvi is more prone to corrosion is more hydrophobic and has a higher charge transfer rate than nzvi in contrast fesx has a higher electronegativity 5 02 ev for fes and 5 39 ev for fes2 than that of fe0 4 04 ev and a better electron conductivity with a lower band gap 0 10 ev for fes and 0 95 ev for fes2 than that of iron oxides which ranged from 2 20 to 2 60 ev thus the fesx layer could facilitate the transfer of electrons from fe0 to the chemisorbed pnp 76 in addition fesx is a strong reductant that can reduce pnp thus s nzvi has a higher corrosion potential than nzvi meaning that corrosion is more likely to occur and release electrons contrastingly previous studies found that the adsorption of water molecules was inhibited on the surface of nzvi after sulfidation treatment 77 which improved the electron selectivity of nzvi suppressed the rate of hydrogen precipitation and improved electron utilization the above results showed that sulfidation treatment has obvious advantages in removing pnp from nzvi 3 4 aging and reuse experiment to further explore whether biochar loading and surface sulfidation can slow down the surface passivation caused by nzvi corrosion aging experiments with nzni nzni bc and s nzni bc were conducted in anaerobic water for different times the effect of the aging time on pnp removal was measured and is shown in fig 11 a the pnp removal efficiency of bare nzvi decreased to 81 after ten days of aging and only 52 of the pnp removal ability remained after 30 d of aging this showed that the surface passivation of nzni caused by corrosion was very serious and the lifetime of nzni was very low the pnp removal efficiencies of nzni bc and s nzni bc after 10 d of aging were 88 and 90 respectively these two materials were similar and both were higher than nzvi indicating that the use of biochar loading and surface sulfidation treatment can improve the anti aging properties of nzvi after 30 d of aging the pnp removal capacity of s nzni bc was 78 which was much higher than that of nzni bc 68 this was due to the existence of the sulfide layer which can delay surface passivation due to corrosion and further prolong its life stability and reusability are important factors when evaluating the catalyst performance five consecutive pnp removal experiments were performed on s nzni bc fig 11 b and it was found that the pnp removal ability of s nzni bc remained at 50 after four cycles the reason for the decreased removal efficiency was that the accumulation of pnp and its degradation products on the surface of s nzvi bc and the passivation layer hindered the electron transfer and mass transfer processes these results suggest that s nzvi bc is a promising material for highly stable pnp removal 3 5 removal mechanism of pnp 3 5 1 characterization the degradation products of pnp were measured by gc ms after 10 min of the reaction fig 12 a as expected the characteristic peak of pnp appeared at 16 47 min and the characteristic peak of p aminophenol was formed by the reduction of pnp at 12 94 min this finding was consistent with the results of previous studies 6 in addition the characteristic peak of p benzoquinone a typical oxidation product appeared at 7 22 min indicating that there was an oxidation reaction during the reduction of pnp by s nzvi bc under anaerobic conditions this may be attributed to the strong oxidation of oh generated by the fe3 and fe2 activated h2o eqs 18 and 19 6 18 fe 3 h 2 o fe 2 oh h 19 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh fig 12 b shows the xrd patterns of nzni nzni bc s nzni bc and post reaction s nzni bc the main peak of nzvi appeared at 2Î¸ 44 8 which was attributed to the fe 110 crystal plane with better crystallinity after nzvi was loaded onto the biochar the characteristic peak of the c 002 crystal plane appeared at 2Î¸ 22 7 in the nzni bc spectrum the characteristic peak intensity of fe0 in s nzni bc became weaker which was attributed to the shielding effect of fes formed after sulfidation treatment on the surface observation of the s nzni bc spectrum after the reaction revealed that the characteristic peaks of fe0 disappeared and the characteristic peaks of feooh and fe3o4 appeared this indicated that fe0 participated in the reaction and the surface of the s nzni particles was completely covered by a mixed shell composed of feooh and fe3o4 after the reaction the surface elements and contents of nzni bc s nzni bc and post reaction s nzni bc were analyzed by xps the fe2p spectrum in fig 12 c shows that the characteristic peak of fe0 appears near 707 1 ev in the nzni bc and s nzni bc samples and the fe0 content after sulfidation treatment decreased from 4 to 2 6 this shows that nzvi was well prepared and its surface was not fully vulcanized the result was consistent with the conclusion drawn from the xrd results both samples showed characteristic peaks of fe2 710 5 and 724 2 ev and fe3 713 3 and 727 5 ev which were due to the inevitable oxidation of nzni during the preparation process to form shell layers that are considered to be feooh and fe3o4 78 the characteristic peaks of iron oxides were not observed in the xrd pattern because of their low iron oxide content and poor crystallinity after the reaction the characteristic peak of fe0 on the surface of s nzni bc disappeared and the fe2 content decreased from 71 7 to 39 5 indicating that the surface of nzvi was oxidized and fe2o3 was dominant which was consistent with the conclusion obtained by the xrd results comparing the s2p spectra of s nzni bc before and after the reaction fig 1 d it was found that the characteristic peaks at 161 8 163 4 and 168 1 ev before the reaction belonged to s2 s2 2 and so4 2 respectively and their content ratio was s2 s2 2 so4 2 4 83 indicating that the ferric sulfides at this time were fes and fes2 after the reaction the contents of s2 and s2 2 decreased and the content of so4 2 increased greatly s2 s2 2 so4 2 0 28 which indicated that ferric sulfide had been converted into iron sulfate in other words fe2 s2 and s2 2 also played a role in removing pnp making fe0 more reducible 3 5 2 dft calculation after the calculation figs s1 s3 and tables s1 s2 it was found that the most stable adsorption configuration of pnp on the fe 110 surface was the lb 30 2 configuration fig 13 a b which is a strong chemical adsorption to gain insight into the interfacial adsorption of pnp on nzvi shells the adsorption energies and transferred charges of pnps on fe 110 iron oxide shells and fes shells were compared fig 13 c when nzvi was exposed to fe0 the adsorption energy of pnp was 90 53 kcal mol mentioned above and the transfer charge amount was 0 59 e which is a strong chemical adsorption however during the preparation of nzvi feo was inevitably oxidized by do or h2o to form an amorphous iron oxide shell wang 79 proposed that the oxide shell formation sequence of nzvi was feo fe3o4 fe2o3 and feooh however the adsorption energy of pnp on the feooh surface was only 17 98 kcal mol and the transfer charge amount was 0 11 e which is a very weak chemical adsorption the feooh is a non conducting layer with a bandgap of 2 3 ev and few electrons can penetrate the outer feooh layer while fes has a specific electron transfer ability and a lower bandgap 0 1 ev and it has a higher electron transport efficiency the adsorption energy of pnp on the fes surface was 145 95 kcal mol and the transfer charge amount was 0 66 e which is a very strong chemical adsorption therefore s nzvi has obvious advantages in removing pnp it can more easily adsorb pnp and transfer electrons quickly to allow pnp to participate in the reaction 3 5 3 synergistic mechanism of pnp removal by s nzvi bc the removal of pnp was the combined result of the adsorption of biochar redox and enhanced electron transfer mechanisms of the s nzvi particles and based on the experimental results a pathway for the removal of pnp by s nzvi bc first the shell layer around the s nzvi core reacted with the biochar surface functional groups to form stable bonds thereby reducing the agglomeration of s nzvi owing to the aromaticity of the biochar the adsorption of pnp and contact of s nzvi with pnp were promoted through hydrophobic interactions and Ï Ï interactions the enhanced adsorption of pnp on the biochar made its reduction possible in contrast the fesx shell layer had higher hydrophobicity and a higher charge transfer rate which made it easier for pnp to adsorb onto the reaction surface and participate in the reaction quickly it can be preliminarily inferred that the pathway for s nzvi bc to remove pnp under anaerobic conditions involved several steps 1 pnp molecules were adsorbed onto the s nzvi bc surface 2 s nzvi had two pathways for the release of electrons by corrosion on the one hand nzvi had a higher reduction potential after sulfidation treatment and was more prone to corrosion the fe0 and sulfur ions s2 and s2 2 released a large number of electrons on the other hand a large number of micro galvanic cells were formed between the s nzvi and biochar which promoted the corrosion of nzni the h or h 2o in solution obtained electrons to generate more reducible h eqs 10 and 11 the pnp adsorbed on the s nzvi or biochar surface gained electrons and was reduced to pap with the participation of h in addition the sulfide layer suppressed the h to h2 transition and improved the electron utilization efficiency simultaneously the production of p benzoquinone was observed which was attributed to the strong oxidizing oh generated by fe3 and fe2 activated h2o eqs 18 and 19 3 the reaction intermediates or reaction products were desorbed from the surface of s nzvi bc in conclusion pnp removal using s nzvi bc involved physical adsorption and chemical redox reactions electrochemistry the enhanced activity of s nzvi bc was mainly attributed to accelerated fe0 corrosion by the micro galvanic cells and sulfide layer of s nzvi bc 4 applications and prospects nitro organic pollutants in the environment are of great concern and pnp has been considered a priority environmental pollutant in many countries nzvi is one of the most widely used materials for the removal of pnp however nzvi is prone to oxidation and agglomeration in practical applications many studies have focused on enhancing the stability and reactivity of nzvi the results of this study show that sulfidation and biochar modification can significantly improve the performance of nzvi for pnp removal s nzvi bc combines the advantages of s nzvi and biochar which provide a cost effective method for the removal of pnp from wastewater in addition to being a promising material for pnp removal from wastewater s nzvi bc may also be used for in situ or ex situ remediation of contaminated soil on the other hand the study of s nzvi bc in medical dye and heavy metal wastewater treatment industrial and continuous flow experiments deserve to be launched to solve the unexpected problems of s nzvi bc technology in commercialization and in real environment 5 conclusions a series of modified nzvi materials were prepared and static removal experiments of pnp were performed the hydrophobicity and Ï Ï interactions of the biochar surface had the greatest impact on the pnp removal ability biochar could effectively alleviate the agglomeration of nzni and form a miniature galvanic cell with nzvi to promote the corrosion of nzvi surface sulfidation treatment not only improved the pnp removal efficiency and reaction rate but also delayed the occurrence of surface passivation double modification reduced the energy barrier of the pnp removal reaction and maintained the stability of the particles in water the effective reducing agents for pnp in the s nzvi bc system were fe0 fe2 s2 and s2 2 the dft calculations revealed that pnp is more easily adsorbed and participates in the

12661,this work aimed to develop a mathematical model based on monte carlo simulation to predict the energy potential of biogas produced in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor treating swine wastewater sww for a farm with up to 10 000 pigs in order to determine the sww energy potential various organic loading rates olrs were studied in lab scale experiments complemented with information found in the literature then the energy potential of biogas was evaluated considering three categories of pig farms small medium and large which corresponded to different scales 250 500 and 1000 pigs the potential for electrical energy recovery was 227 0 500 8 and 1103 6 kwh d 1 for small medium and large scale pig farm respectively the simulation results show that the model allowed an estimation close to reality with reduced errors r2 value of 0 934 was found to estimate methane and electric energy flow as a function of the removed load and 0 823 in terms of reactor inflow function thus the model proved to be a relevant tool for entrepreneurship and its use can enable studies to implement energy self sufficiency projects it was also inferred that biogas plants have great potential for profitability in electricity generation and cost reduction in projects in conclusion this research presents an alternative model for estimating methane and electrical energy potential for uasb reactors treating sww graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords swine wastewater anaerobic digestion anaerobic sludge biogas energy recovery data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction pork meat has been reported as the most widely consumed meat worldwide in 2020 it represented 32 of the most consumed animal proteins accounting for about 109 106 tons 1 3 the confined animal feeding operations cafos model has been applied to supply these increasing demands for animal protein resulting in high swine wastewater sww volume even for small geographical areas 3 4 owing to the high chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen and phosphorus compounds 4 6 antibiotics and hormones 7 8 direct sww discharge represents serious environmental and public health concerns including oxygen depletion in receiving water bodies eutrophication global warming which affect the dilution capacity of receiving water bodies and toxicity related impacts 9 15 therefore efficient economical and environmentally friendly waste techniques must be developed to deal with the large amounts of sww generated globally 4 in this regard some potentially feasible techniques including anaerobic digestion ad have been developed 16 17 the ad can represent an important part of the biomass utilization involved in renewable energy systems res 18 25 bringing environmental economic and energy benefits 26 30 in particular the ad converts the complex organic matter present in the waste into biogas which predominantly contains methane in addition to co2 h2s and h2 as gaseous products along with a cod rich liquid digestate 31 an appropriate option for the sww anaerobic treatment is the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb due to its low investment and operational costs low footprint application capacity for different scales low energy demand and the capacity to yield energy through the produced biogas 32 34 the methane gas generated in the digestion process can be collected and used as a source of thermal and electrical energy and or fuel for vehicles and transportation resulting in the direct and indirect reduction of carbon dioxide emissions 35 36 this is one of the alternatives to mitigate the treatment impacts and also a powerful tool to mitigate climate change because it promotes the adequate destination of residues and uses greenhouse gases ghg 37 38 this thinking motivates the wastewater treatment industry to strive for energy self sufficiency i e treatment with positive energy which can be achieved through a combination of reduced energy consumption and or increased on site energy production 39 40 and also by optimizing the system determining the best operating conditions and reducing potential expenses 41 however the models that study these processes are usually based on domestic wastewater treatment disregarding other types of wastewater like sww 42 only very few studies address the energy efficiency of sww treatment processes energetic self sustainability is one of the main aspects to be developed in future agro industrial waste treatment systems among the few studies it is possible to mention process simulation for energy optimization of a treatment plant under various climatic conditions 43 therefore studies must consider the by products energy potential and the full wastewater operation energy demand 44 45 due to the high methane content biogas presents a significant caloric value that allows an effective energy recovery 44 one major advantage is that the energy produced in an sww treatment system can be fully utilized on site without needing a distribution network 46 also reducing indirect ghg emissions 47 from an environmental and economic perspective related to climate change any reduction in energy consumption and associated ghg emissions is valuable 48 49 in this context the application of mathematical models is a potential alternative for process engineers to evaluate the feasibility of certain scenarios for recovering thermal or electrical energy from uasb reactors helping in the decision making process 44 50 however the vast majority of projects and investigations conducted so far are applied to industrial wastewaters and sewage 40 as a result ad plants for sww were hardly ever designed with energy efficiency in mind 50 52 additionally the estimation using models already proposed for other wastewaters leads to inaccurate values many times neglecting the sww characteristics the development of mathematical models to estimate biogas production and energy potential in uasb reactors treating sww is still incipient 44 which was the driving force for the present study therefore a model that uses simple operational parameters such as the number of pigs and the flows of wastewater produced is proposed also allowing the estimation of pig farms energy recovery potential and assisting in the decision making process the model was developed considering a better representation of the cod mass balance for this the monte carlo distribution was used which is based on many simulations in which for each run a different group input value is randomly selected from the established limits this procedure makes the estimation capability simplified by considering multiple parameters and ranges involving several conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrate the raw sww was collected from the pig bays cleaning throughout the experiment the pigs were at many development stages and were fed with corn and soybean based food the raw sww was obtained from the zootechny department dzo of the federal university of cearÃ¡ ufc in fortaleza brazil it was subjected to a preliminary treatment in a 2 mm square mesh sieve for solid separation simulating the conditions found in full scale treatment plants 53 54 the sww was placed in an equalization tank et with mechanical agitation to avoid solids sedimentation and kept under refrigeration at 4 c to avoid natural biodegradation of organic matter which impacts the reactor loading rates 2 2 uasb reactor a lab scale uasb reactor made of pvc was used with a working volume of 3 25 l the reactor was fed by a diaphragm pump coleparmer masterflex l s 7522 30 usa to keep the flow rate constant 32 biogas production was quantified twice a week by a gasometer ritter molligascounter 55 57 the uasb reactor was operated at 28 6 c and seeded with granular sludge 1 6 l from a full scale uasb reactor used in a sewage treatment plant in fortaleza brazil the content of total solids ts total volatile solids tvs and total fixed solids tfs were 44 3 2 5 29 5 1 4 and 14 7 1 1 g l 1 respectively 2 3 experimental stages fig 1 shows the experimental set up schematic the uasb reactor started up as previously described 58 with an sww containing average cod of 5 g l 1 at a flow rate q of 4 5 ml min 1 resulting in a biological organic rate bor of 0 7kgcod kgvs 1d 1 organic loading rate olr of 10 4 0 9 kgcod m 3 d 1 volumetric hydraulic load vhl of 2 m3 m 3d 1 and hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h the influent cod q olr vhl and hrt values were kept constant during the 343 days of experiment after 64 days of start up from the end of 2020 to 2021 afterward the flow rate was increased progressively over the experimental stages resulting in increased olrs and reduced hrts the experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 note sww swine wastewater 2 4 chemical and chromatographic analyzes chemical oxygen demand cod total particulate and soluble

and detector temperatures were 50 c 100 c and 250 c respectively 2 5 calculation of biogas potential produced from sww three methodologies 61 63 already established in the literature for estimating methane production in uasb reactors were compared table 2 considering the sww characteristics and the reactor operation method methane production was estimated from the flow monitoring report cod influent and effluent and normal temperature and pressure conditions biogas production was estimated based on the final methane production and biogas composition 64 then the chemical electrical and thermal energy production was calculated in each methane recovery scenario assumed 61 63 the equations used can also be found in table 2 comparing the methodologies the estimated biogas methane values were closer to those experimentally measured in the reactor using the von sperling and chenicharo 63 methodology reaching a ratio of 0 8 therefore higher than the values obtained with other approaches 2 6 energy potential of biogas after comparison and methodology selection the energy potential of biogas was estimated by the most representative one 63 65 and by the experimental data table 2 the calculations required to generate electricity from biogas simulated and experimentally measured are also presented in table 2 the combined heat and power chp machine efficiency has been assumed to be 40 for electrical conversion 66 the internal combustion engine and generator group have the highest need for shutdowns due to a higher biogas content impurity thus a capacity factor cf of 70 was used 45 67 this value is lower than the normally used for thermoelectric plants moved by gas which is around 90 according to cetesb environmental company of the state of sÃ£o paulo 67 68 the following variables were considered for the calculations lcv is the methane lower calorific value 7461 95 kcal kg 1 for a gas content of 70 81 they resulted in an available lcv of 9 98 kwh nm 3 ch4 for methane with a specific weight swch4 of 1 15 kg nm 3 44 45 69 71 2 7 monte carlo model regression the regression considered the 1 data collection during the uasb reactor operation treating sww 2 adoption of data not obtained experimentally 3 pig population distribution by monte carlo method and 4 estimation of methane and energy production for each simulation considering the experimental conditions regression and its validation for three pig farms of different sizes a monte carlo based model to estimate the biogas energy potential was developed and structured in an electronic spreadsheet under the premise of simplicity and due to the reduced number of input data conceptually the model considered the sww cod conversion routes and methane flow rate in the uasb reactor a previous monte carlo based model to estimate the production of biogas and methane and the energy recovery potential in uasb reactors was developed by lobato et al 65 and rosa et al 44 for domestic sewage to estimate the energy potential of biogas precisely 500 simulations for a stable trend plot 500 to 1000 samples are needed were performed for each scenario using the monte carlo method uniform distribution which is based on a high number of simulations in each model execution a different group of input values is selected randomly according to the uniform distribution within pre established ranges 65 according to rosa et al 44 all outcomes are equally likely the input data parameters and their respective ranges for calculating the energy potential of biogas were cod removal efficiency ecod reactor operational

d 1 furthermore this mathematical model was structured under different operational conditions once the input data were defined based on these portions of cod removal from the system experiment the total cod converted into ch4 and consequent volumetric production is calculated to calculate the ch4 volume actually available for energy use the model considers the ch4 losses finally deducting these losses the potentially available energy is calculated 65 following the simulations the model validation was carried out based on measured biogas production and composition in small medium and large scale uasb reactors for the three scenarios sizes of pig farms 250 500 and 1000 pigs for this purpose cod contribution 8 4 3 7 kgcodt kgswine 1 based on a 90 kg pig and a efficiency of cod removal 70 44 65 72 were adopted monte carlo simulation allows the generation of a random data set within a pre established limit in this study it was used to insert the variation of conditions in an sww treatment system addressing different operational conditions input variables and incorporating several possibilities that may occur during the operation of a treatment system within favorable conditions the regression produced in the end was able to meet the various conditions given the number of simulations performed 2 8 model evaluation and statistical analysis statistical significance was tested by analysis of variance anova complemented with mean value comparison using tukey s hsd tests with a significancy threshold p value of 0 05 9 if p 0 05 the null hypothesis is rejected i e the data groups are considered statistically different 30 73 76 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental reactor performance 3 1 1 organic load removal efficiency the uasb reactor was continuously operated for 407 days including four experimental stages at different olrs after the start up table 3 the effluent cod and cod removal efficiency are shown in fig 2 the reactor showed a good cod removal capacity fig 2b reaching the maximum of 93 8 2 1 when the hrt was 12 h however the highest methane production rates were obtained at hrts of 6 and 8 h 32 furthermore at the different experiment stages the lowest efficiency achieved was 83 assuming that changes in hrt did not affect cod removal in this period the distinctions of the cod removals were not apparent among the four stages and the cod removal of each system presented an upward trend at the beginning and then kept steady conversely wang et al 77 reported that cod removal efficiency was reduced by changing the hrt from 15 h to 10 h operating a uasb reactor treating sugary wastewater although a high methane rate was still found however the efficiencies achieved in the current study are within the ranges reported in the literature close to 90 for uasb reactors as reported by montes et al 9 these results follow the methane yielded by the reactor showing high efficiency reactor process performance the soluble cod consumption efficiency was 61 8 18 6 while particulate cod was 74 4 14 6 a higher consumption of particulate cod in the reactor was observed table 3 mainly at stages ii iii and iv and higher methane yields at stages iii and iv the highest cod conversion towards methane production were at stages iii 36 1 and iv 36 1 table 3 also increasing particulate cod in the effluent 22 3 and 28 8 and reducing the particulate cod remained in the reactor and the part of soluble cod used for microbial biomass growth 22 3 and 28 8 in contrast at stages i and ii the largest shares were due to these last cod fractions 42 6 and 49 2 reducing the shares for methane 33 1 and 26 2 however those for soluble cod were more predominant at stages i and ii table 3 in addition the variation in ph value in the uasb reactor was also monitored a significant difference was found in the influent ph among the stages p 4e 08 ranging from 5 3 to 8 7 however no significant difference was found p 0 136 for the effluent ph with a minimum and maximum of 7 2 and 8 6 respectively at an 8 h hrt a low decrease in ph values was observed in the reactor effluent 8 2 to 7 6 regardless of the influent ph the system showed a good buffering capacity resulting in low variation of methane production some literature recommends a ph range between 6 5 and 7 5 depending on substrate and digestion technique 78 79 while cheng et al 7 80 suggest a value between 7 4 and 7 0 for sww treatment thus the ph values obtained were in the recommended ranges 3 1 2 biogas and methane production the average methane production at each experiment stage and methane content in the biogas can be observed in fig 3a and b respectively furthermore table 3 shows the most relevant descriptive statistics as previously observed 9 the daily methane yield increased each time feed conditions were modified due to the higher organic loading rate applied the reactor produced a maximum daily volume of 15 l ch4 at day 506 when the system was fed with 21 8 kgcod m 3d 1 montes et al 9 suggested a good relationship between the olr and the methane yield during the operational periods however the present work did not identify such a correlation the reactor produced a methane flow rate of 1 8 to 15 0 nl d 1 and the highest flow rate was identified at stage iv table 3 and fig 3a which was the period when the highest olr was applied this observation agrees with the literature in which increasing olr up to a certain value generates higher biogas methane production without influencing the methane concentration 32 81 the data showed a stable operation with olr up to 20 1 kgcod m 3 d 1 allowing a stable mean methane yield of 260 9 lch4 kgcodt rem 1 table 3 and fig 3c the reactor produced a methane rich biogas from the 47th day of operation onwards the biogas quality was high at the lowest olr applied 77 3 ch4 the methane content in the biogas increased linearly over the operation stages i to iv as previously reported in the literature 9 82 furthermore methane content in the biogas increased from 74 8 at an olr of 12 2 kgcod m 3 d 1 to 81 1 at 14 8 kgcod m 3 d 1 the methane yield ranged from 68 9 to 441 0 nl kgcodt rem 1 however there was no significant difference between the stages in terms of methane p 0 287 and biogas p 0 549 productions the results found in this work are within the methane yield range reported in the literature for sww and other wastewaters as shown in table 4 even though there are differences among the wastewater compositions and the operating conditions applied the experiment methane yields were lower only in uasb reactors treating sww at an hrt of 24 h 83 svc sugar cane vinasse at an hrt of 20 h 84 tv tequila vinasses at an hrt of 24 h 85 and anmbr treating bmiw beet molasses based industrial wastewater at hrts of 12 and 14 h 86 as shown in table 4 the values achieved at stages iii and iv were close to the maximums achieved in the literature these studies which obtained higher methane production values than in this investigation operated the reactor under a reduced olr perhaps this increase in methane production can be attributed to this reduced olr which did not occur in the present work or perhaps concerning the wastewater characteristics among the experiment stages stage ii presented the least variability in its value fig 2b even though it was below the values identified at stages iii and iv no significant difference was found p 0 6 3 2 sww energy potential assessment the sww energetic potential was based on the experimentally obtained methane yield values furthermore the conversion of the biogas in generators and similar systems was not considered i e the losses inherent to such systems were not included 88 the uasb reactor energy potential was assessed to check whether energy self sufficiency can be achieved or whether the biogas recovered from this system can be a viable alternative to fossil fuels energy production from the methane yield and heat recovery were identified as key factors affecting the energy balance 89 the calculations were performed with the equations presented in table 2 and the results are shown in table 3 thus an energy analysis was performed to evaluate the feasibility of electrical and thermal generation for full scale applications 20 the overall sww energy potential was 27 2 mj m 3 sww 7 6 kwh m 3 sww with the highest value achieved at stages iii 29 1 mj m 3 sww and iv 29 4 mj m 3 sww the obtained values of the sww energy potential were higher than those reported for the wastewater from the chocolate processing industry 13 6 3 7 mj m 3 32 and wastewater from recycled pulp and paper 6 3 mj kgcodt rem 1 90 when domestic wastewater is considered for electrical energy recovery the following values are obtained 2 mj m 3 91 1 6 to 3 5 mj m 3 44 and 1 5 to 2 9 mj m 3 65 all of which are lower compared to the sww potential a typical chp engine s overall efficiency is around 70 to 85 in this regard typical effective electric efficiencies for combustion turbine based chp systems range from 35 to 45 whereas typical thermal efficiencies range from 40 to 50 20 32 66 92 94 the chp system efficiency has been assumed to be 40 for electrical conversion and 45 for heat conversion 66 95 a pig farm with about 2500 swine has an average daily wastewater production of 3532 5 m3 per month the power yield could reach up to about 29 kwh or 104 gj per month 348 mwh per year considering the energetic potential obtained in this study which represents a potential power source 32 assuming an average biogas to electricity conversion rate of 40 the power yield of the produced biogas by the uasb reactor could reach up to 139 mwh yr 1 the annual average electricity consumption per household is between 1500 and 2565 kwh 32 96 97 therefore the power yield from biogas obtained in the anaerobic digestion of sww in the evaluated scenario would be enough to satisfy the electricity requirements of 93 to 54 households 3 3 simulation of the sww energy potential most models that estimate methane production in uasb reactors were developed for domestic wastewater treatment thus an attempt was made to develop a model that would consider certain peculiarities associated with sww 98 99 such as high cod values and tss content among others 100 101 also taking into account the actual share of methane recovered higher for sww based on the literature 9 83 102 thus the system s capacity to produce methane was identified and used to develop the model first the number of swine was delimited which defined the model application limit subsequently this amount was uniformly distributed using the monte carlo method and the wastewater flow was determined 44 91 the methodology proposed by lobato et al 65 and rosa et al 44 table 2 was used to estimate the methane flow rate in each simulation applying secondary data through this regressions were carried out to find models that could express and estimate the methane production of different size pig farms table 5 summarizes the linear regression relationships obtained for the simulated data presented in fig 4 the best r2 was observed when the input data estimated the energy potential and methane production as a function of the organic load removed however the r2 coefficients as a function of the influent flow were also acceptable 0 823 in the worst and best scenario for domestic wastewater the regression between methane and wastewater flow rates was r2 of 0 57 and 0 78 respectively and between electrical power and wastewater flow rate would be r2 of 0 83 44 this shows that the regressions performed in this work table 5 to estimate methane were higher than the reported limits which may represent precision regarding power the values were close 3 3 1 validation of the mathematical model after obtaining the models it is necessary to validate by comparing the observed and modeled data errors between estimated and observed values were calculated an r2 of 0 86 and 0 88 were obtained for the methane flow estimate as a function of the load removed and sww flow rate data not shown respectively the values are the same for calculating electrical energy another form of verification is comparing the yields obtained in the experiment and those estimated for real conditions three swine farms were used with quantities uniformly distributed by monte carlo simulation to analyze the estimation and potential of each scenario table 6 and the experimental table 3 and model data were compared table 6 overall a good fit was found in the proposed situations except for small swine farming methane production achieved for large size pig farms was close to the values obtained at stages iii and iv table 4 with a productivity of 203 5 nlch4 kgcodt rem 1 on the other hand the production obtained from the medium sized swine farm came close to stages i and ii with a discrepancy of 8 5 and 8 7 respectively the estimation for small size pig farms assumed a discrepancy of 40 stage iv which is not ideal if compared to the range of 10 to 30 reported elsewhere 103 104 thus small and medium sized pigs are associated with stages i and ii and large sized pigs with stages iii and iv table 7 shows relevant results reported in the literature data on regression models for estimating biogas production in anaerobic digesters in addition some of these works seek to optimize the optimal conditions to obtain better biogas volumes oliveira et al 105 proposed a generic methodology to estimate and optimize the energy potential of waste biomass however in this latter work conversion factors of animal manure to methane energy were used disregarding animal size and weight and the operating conditions variations in another study asadi et al 106 proposed modelling to estimate the biogas production rate in anaerobic digesters and optimization of suitable conditions they evaluated input parameters to develop a model by regression on the other hand donoso bravo et al 107 suggested methodologies for model definition and evaluation in ad processes the models proposed by lobato et al 65 and rosa et al 44 69 are the closest to the one proposed in the current study which were developed for domestic wastewater table 7 shows an overview of the application and performance of regression models for estimating methane generation rate in anaerobic digestion systems compared to the present work according to the literature table 7 most models were developed for specific wastewater even though there is a predominance of uasb reactors the waste characteristics and model development are different 3 3 2 fitting the mathematical model the simulation fig 5 considered a variation in the number of swine from 1 to 10 000 to better assess the model s suitability data from the three pig farms for methane production and electricity recovery were pooled with the model data table 5 the values are close to the trend line predicted by the model demonstrating an acceptable adherence the r2 was 0 85 for estimating methane and 0 95 for energy recovery both as a function of the removed loading rates showing the greatest model adherence the maximum error reached for both was 14 close to the values reported in the literature 74 115 3 3 3 system profitability the cost of kwh consumed obtained by the weighted average of peak and off peak tariffs for blue modality subgroup a2 is 0 072 us kwh 1 the cost avoided by using 100 of the recovered energy table 6 given the above a small scale pig farm which consumed full power would reduce its annual expenditure by approximately us 6522 2552 table 6 it assumes higher values for medium and large swine farms as expected table 6 therefore a relevant economy can be achieved upon methane recovery besides avoiding its release into the atmosphere in addition revenue on carbon credits could be obtained considering the commodity price of 34 76 per ton for the end of 2021 116 given this it is inferred that relatively high amounts of revenue can be achieved with this activity as a pig farm of only 250 pigs manages to raise approximately us 7315 per year the energy that can be recovered in swine farms can supply their electrical and thermal needs and there are positive environmental effects 117 if there is a good profitability probability for biogas plants projects that generate biogas of higher quality have the potential to reach a balance between 76 1 and 120 0 us kwh 1 118 however the biogas increase would demand a greater capital expenditure increasing the project and investment risks nonetheless the probabilities must be analyzed 4 conclusions a model was developed using monte carlo simulation random distribution of values in the range and several variables were considered such as the number of pigs loading contribution per pig weight reactor efficiency methane concentration cod for biomass growth and cod used for sulfate reduction the sww can be treated in a uasb reactor generating methane rich biogas the results show the feasibility of recovering methane with a yield of 260 9 nl kgcodt rem 1 and the recovery capacity of electrical energy 2 6 kwh kgcodt rem 1 the developed model allowed a better representation of the sww energy potential and its theoretical capacity for methane recovery the simulation results show that the model allowed an estimation close to reality with reduced errors r2 value of 0 934 was found to estimate methane and electric energy flow as a function of the removed load and 0 823 in terms of reactor inflow function this model was used to estimate the potential of three pig farms and the values found were significantly close to those obtained on a laboratory scale the yields achieved were also close to those reported in the literature showing a great adherence and fit to the data thus the model proved to be a relevant tool for entrepreneurship and its use can enable studies to implement energy self sufficiency projects it was also inferred that biogas plants have great potential for profitability in electricity generation and cost reduction in projects in conclusion this work presents an alternative model for estimating methane and electrical energy potential for reactors treating sww declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12661,this work aimed to develop a mathematical model based on monte carlo simulation to predict the energy potential of biogas produced in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor treating swine wastewater sww for a farm with up to 10 000 pigs in order to determine the sww energy potential various organic loading rates olrs were studied in lab scale experiments complemented with

projects and investigations conducted so far are applied to industrial wastewaters and sewage 40 as a result ad plants for sww were hardly ever designed with energy efficiency in mind 50 52 additionally the estimation using models already proposed for other wastewaters leads to inaccurate values many times neglecting the sww characteristics the development of mathematical models to estimate biogas production and energy potential in uasb reactors treating sww is still incipient 44 which was the driving force for the present study therefore a model that uses simple operational parameters such as the number of pigs and the flows of wastewater produced is proposed also allowing the estimation of pig farms energy recovery potential and assisting in the decision making process the model was developed considering a better representation of the cod mass balance for this the monte carlo distribution was used which is based on many simulations in which for each run a different group input value is randomly selected from the established limits this procedure makes the estimation capability simplified by considering multiple parameters and ranges involving several conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrate the raw sww was collected from the pig bays cleaning throughout the experiment the pigs were at many development stages and were fed with corn and soybean based food the raw sww was obtained from the zootechny department dzo of the federal university of cearÃ¡ ufc in fortaleza brazil it was subjected to a preliminary treatment in a 2 mm square mesh sieve for solid separation simulating the conditions found in full scale treatment plants 53 54 the sww was placed in an equalization tank et with mechanical agitation to avoid solids sedimentation and kept under refrigeration at 4 c to avoid natural biodegradation of organic matter which impacts the reactor loading rates 2 2 uasb reactor a lab scale uasb reactor made of pvc was used with a working volume of 3 25 l the reactor was fed by a diaphragm pump coleparmer masterflex l s 7522 30 usa to keep the flow rate constant 32 biogas production was quantified twice a week by a gasometer ritter molligascounter 55 57 the uasb reactor was operated at 28 6 c and seeded with granular sludge 1 6 l from a full scale uasb reactor used in a sewage treatment plant in fortaleza brazil the content of

uasb reactor started up as previously described 58 with an sww containing average cod of 5 g l 1 at a flow rate q of 4 5 ml min 1 resulting in a biological organic rate bor of 0 7kgcod kgvs 1d 1 organic loading rate olr of 10 4 0 9 kgcod m 3 d 1 volumetric hydraulic load vhl of 2 m3 m 3d 1 and hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h the influent cod q olr vhl and hrt values were kept constant during the 343 days of experiment after 64 days of start up from the end of 2020 to 2021 afterward the flow rate was increased progressively over the experimental stages resulting in increased olrs and reduced hrts the experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 note sww swine wastewater 2 4 chemical and chromatographic analyzes chemical oxygen demand cod total particulate and soluble

and detector temperatures were 50 c 100 c and 250 c respectively 2 5 calculation of biogas potential produced from sww three methodologies 61 63 already established in the literature for estimating methane production in uasb reactors were compared table 2 considering the sww characteristics and the reactor operation method methane production was estimated from the flow monitoring report cod influent and effluent and normal temperature and pressure conditions biogas production was estimated based on the final methane production and biogas composition 64 then the chemical electrical and thermal energy production was calculated in each methane recovery scenario assumed 61 63 the equations used can also be found in table 2 comparing the methodologies the estimated biogas methane values were closer to those experimentally measured in the reactor using the von sperling and chenicharo 63 methodology reaching a ratio of 0 8 therefore higher than the values obtained with other approaches 2 6 energy potential of biogas after comparison and methodology selection the energy potential of biogas was estimated by the most representative one 63 65 and by the experimental data table 2 the calculations required to generate electricity from biogas simulated and experimentally measured are also presented in table 2 the combined heat and power chp machine efficiency has been assumed to be 40 for electrical conversion 66 the internal combustion engine and generator group have the highest need for shutdowns due to a higher biogas content impurity thus a capacity factor cf of 70 was used 45 67 this value is lower than the normally used for thermoelectric plants moved by gas which is around 90 according to cetesb environmental company of the state of sÃ£o paulo 67 68 the following variables were considered for the calculations lcv is the methane lower calorific value 7461 95 kcal kg 1 for a gas content of 70 81 they resulted in an available lcv of 9 98 kwh nm 3 ch4 for methane with a specific weight swch4 of 1 15 kg nm 3 44 45 69 71 2 7 monte carlo model regression the regression considered the 1 data collection during the uasb reactor operation treating sww 2 adoption of data not obtained experimentally 3 pig population distribution by monte carlo method and 4 estimation of methane and energy production for each simulation considering the experimental conditions regression and its validation for three pig farms of different sizes a monte carlo based model to estimate the biogas energy potential was developed and structured in an electronic spreadsheet under the premise of simplicity and due to the reduced number of input data conceptually the model considered the sww cod conversion routes and methane flow rate in the uasb reactor a previous monte carlo based model to estimate the production of biogas and methane and the energy recovery potential in uasb reactors was developed by lobato et al 65 and rosa et al 44 for domestic sewage to estimate the energy potential of biogas precisely 500 simulations for a stable trend plot 500 to 1000 samples are needed were performed for each scenario using the monte carlo method uniform distribution which is based on a high number of simulations in each model execution a different group of input values is selected randomly according to the uniform distribution within pre established ranges 65 according to rosa et al 44 all outcomes are equally likely the input data parameters and their respective ranges for calculating the energy potential of biogas were cod removal efficiency ecod reactor operational temperature t ch4 percentage in the biogas cch4 cod contribution per pig 0 13 0 10 kgcodtswine 1 d 1 pig population contribution ns 1 to 10 000 units and sewage contribution per pig cs 47 1 l animal 1 d 1 furthermore this mathematical model was structured under different operational conditions once the input data were defined based on these portions of cod removal from the system experiment the total cod converted into ch4 and consequent volumetric production is calculated to calculate the ch4 volume actually available for energy use the model considers the ch4 losses finally deducting these losses the potentially available energy is calculated 65 following the simulations the model validation was carried out based on measured biogas production and composition in small medium and large scale uasb reactors for the three scenarios sizes of pig farms 250 500 and 1000 pigs for this purpose cod contribution 8 4 3 7 kgcodt kgswine 1 based on a 90 kg pig and a efficiency of cod removal 70 44 65 72 were adopted monte carlo simulation allows the generation of a random data set within a pre established limit in this study it was used to insert the variation of conditions in an sww treatment system addressing different operational conditions input variables and incorporating several possibilities that may occur during the operation of a treatment system within favorable conditions the regression produced in the end was able to meet the various conditions given the number of simulations performed 2 8 model evaluation and statistical analysis statistical significance was tested by analysis of variance anova complemented with mean value comparison using tukey s hsd tests with a significancy threshold p value of 0 05 9 if p 0 05 the null hypothesis is rejected i e the data groups are considered statistically different 30 73 76 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental reactor performance 3 1 1 organic load removal efficiency the uasb reactor was continuously operated for 407 days including four experimental stages at different olrs after the start up table 3 the effluent cod and cod removal efficiency are shown in fig 2 the reactor showed a good cod removal capacity fig 2b reaching the maximum of 93 8 2 1 when the hrt was 12 h however the highest methane production rates were obtained at hrts of 6 and 8 h 32 furthermore at the different experiment stages the lowest efficiency achieved was 83 assuming that changes in hrt did not affect cod removal in this period the distinctions of the cod removals were not apparent among the four stages and the cod removal of each system presented an upward trend at the beginning and then kept steady conversely wang et al 77 reported that cod removal efficiency was reduced by changing the hrt from 15 h to 10 h operating a uasb reactor treating sugary wastewater although a high methane rate was still found however the efficiencies achieved in the current study are within the ranges reported in the literature close to 90 for uasb reactors as reported by montes et al 9 these results follow the methane yielded by the reactor showing high efficiency reactor process performance the soluble cod consumption efficiency was 61 8 18 6 while particulate cod was 74 4 14 6 a higher consumption of particulate cod in the reactor was observed table 3 mainly at stages ii iii and iv and higher methane yields at stages iii and iv the highest cod conversion towards methane production were at stages iii 36 1 and iv 36 1 table 3 also increasing particulate cod in the effluent 22 3 and 28 8 and reducing the particulate cod remained in the reactor and the part of soluble cod used for microbial biomass growth 22 3 and 28 8 in contrast at stages i and ii the largest shares were due to these last cod fractions 42 6 and 49 2 reducing the shares for methane 33 1 and 26 2 however those for soluble cod were more predominant at stages i and ii table 3 in addition the variation in ph value in the uasb reactor was also monitored a significant difference was found in the influent ph among the stages p 4e 08 ranging from 5 3 to 8 7 however no significant difference was found p 0 136 for the effluent ph with a minimum and maximum of 7 2 and 8 6 respectively at an 8 h hrt a low decrease in ph values was observed in the reactor effluent 8 2 to 7 6 regardless of the influent ph the system showed a good buffering capacity resulting in low variation of methane production some literature recommends a ph range between 6 5 and 7 5 depending on substrate and digestion technique 78 79 while cheng et al 7 80 suggest a value between 7 4 and 7 0 for sww treatment thus the ph values obtained were in the recommended ranges 3 1 2 biogas and methane production the average methane production at each experiment stage and methane content in the biogas can be observed in fig 3a and b respectively furthermore table 3 shows the most relevant descriptive statistics as previously observed 9 the daily methane yield increased each time feed conditions were modified due to the higher organic loading rate applied the reactor produced a maximum daily volume of 15 l ch4 at day 506 when the system was fed with 21 8 kgcod m 3d 1 montes et al 9 suggested a good relationship between the olr and the methane yield during the operational periods however the present work did not identify such a correlation the reactor produced a methane flow rate of 1 8 to 15 0 nl d 1 and the highest flow rate was identified at stage iv table 3 and fig 3a which was the period when the highest olr was applied this observation agrees with the literature in which increasing olr up to a certain value generates higher biogas methane production without influencing the methane concentration 32 81 the data showed a stable operation with olr up to 20 1 kgcod m 3 d 1 allowing a stable mean methane yield of 260 9 lch4 kgcodt rem 1 table 3 and fig 3c the reactor produced a methane rich biogas from the 47th day of operation onwards the biogas quality was high at the lowest olr applied 77 3 ch4 the methane content in the biogas increased linearly over the operation stages i to iv as previously reported in the literature 9 82 furthermore methane content in the biogas increased from 74 8 at an olr of 12 2 kgcod m 3 d 1 to 81 1 at 14 8 kgcod m 3 d 1 the methane yield ranged from 68 9 to 441 0 nl kgcodt rem 1 however there was no significant difference between the stages in terms of methane p 0 287 and biogas p 0 549 productions the results found in this work are within the methane yield range reported in the literature for sww and other wastewaters as shown in table 4 even though there are differences among the wastewater compositions and the operating conditions applied the experiment methane yields were lower only in uasb reactors treating sww at an hrt of 24 h 83 svc sugar cane vinasse at an hrt of 20 h 84 tv tequila vinasses at an hrt of 24 h 85 and anmbr treating bmiw beet molasses based industrial wastewater at hrts of 12 and 14 h 86 as shown in table 4 the values achieved at stages iii and iv were close to the maximums achieved in the literature these studies which obtained higher methane production values than in this investigation operated the reactor under a reduced olr perhaps this increase in methane production can be attributed to this reduced olr which did not occur in the present work or perhaps concerning the wastewater characteristics among the experiment stages stage ii presented the least variability in its value fig 2b even though it was below the values identified at stages iii and iv no significant difference was found p 0 6 3 2 sww energy potential assessment the sww energetic potential was based on the experimentally obtained methane yield values furthermore the conversion of the biogas in generators and similar systems was not considered i e the losses inherent to such systems were not included 88 the uasb reactor energy potential was assessed to check whether energy self sufficiency can be achieved or whether the biogas recovered from this system can be a viable alternative to fossil fuels energy production from the methane yield and heat recovery were identified as key factors affecting the energy balance 89 the calculations were performed with the equations presented in table 2 and the results are shown in table 3 thus an energy analysis was performed to evaluate the feasibility of electrical and thermal generation for full scale applications 20 the overall sww energy potential was 27 2 mj m 3 sww 7 6 kwh m 3 sww with the highest value achieved at stages iii 29 1 mj m 3 sww and iv 29 4 mj m 3 sww the obtained values of the sww energy potential were higher than those reported for the wastewater from the chocolate processing industry 13 6 3 7 mj m 3 32 and wastewater from recycled pulp and paper 6 3 mj kgcodt rem 1 90 when domestic wastewater is considered for electrical energy recovery the following values are obtained 2 mj m 3 91 1 6 to 3 5 mj m 3 44 and 1 5 to 2 9 mj m 3 65 all of which are lower compared to the sww potential a typical chp engine s overall efficiency is around 70 to 85 in this regard typical effective electric efficiencies for combustion turbine based chp systems range from 35 to 45 whereas typical thermal efficiencies range from 40 to 50 20 32 66 92 94 the chp system efficiency has been assumed to be 40 for electrical conversion and 45 for heat conversion 66 95 a pig farm with about 2500 swine has an average daily wastewater production of 3532 5 m3 per month the power yield could reach up to about 29 kwh or 104 gj per month 348 mwh per year considering the energetic potential obtained in this study which represents a potential power source 32 assuming an average biogas to electricity conversion rate of 40 the power yield of the produced biogas by the uasb reactor could reach up to 139 mwh yr 1 the annual average electricity consumption per household is between 1500 and 2565 kwh 32 96 97 therefore the power yield from biogas obtained in the anaerobic digestion of sww in the evaluated scenario would be enough to satisfy the electricity requirements of 93 to 54 households 3 3 simulation of the sww energy potential most models that estimate methane production in uasb reactors were developed for domestic wastewater treatment thus an attempt was made to develop a model that would consider certain peculiarities associated with sww 98 99 such as high cod values and tss content among others 100 101 also taking into account the actual share of methane recovered higher for sww based on the literature 9 83 102 thus the system s capacity to produce methane was identified and used to develop the model first the number of swine was delimited which defined the model application limit subsequently this amount was uniformly distributed using the monte carlo method and the wastewater flow was determined 44 91 the methodology proposed by lobato et al 65 and rosa et al 44 table 2 was used to estimate the methane flow rate in each simulation applying secondary data through this regressions were carried out to find models that could express and estimate the methane production of different size pig farms table 5 summarizes the linear regression relationships obtained for the simulated data presented in fig 4 the best r2 was observed when the input data estimated the energy potential and methane production as a function of the organic load removed however the r2 coefficients as a function of the influent flow were also acceptable 0 823 in the worst and best scenario for domestic wastewater the regression between methane and wastewater flow rates was r2 of 0 57 and 0 78 respectively and between electrical power and wastewater flow rate would be r2 of 0 83 44 this shows that the regressions performed in this work table 5 to estimate methane were higher than the reported limits which may represent precision regarding power the values were close 3 3 1 validation of the mathematical model after obtaining the models it is necessary to validate by comparing the observed and modeled data errors between estimated and observed values were calculated an r2 of 0 86 and 0 88 were obtained for the methane flow estimate as a function of the load removed and sww flow rate data not shown respectively the values are the same for calculating electrical energy another form of verification is comparing the yields obtained in the experiment and those estimated for real conditions three swine farms were used with quantities uniformly distributed by monte carlo simulation to analyze the estimation and potential of each scenario table 6 and the experimental table 3 and model data were compared table 6 overall a good fit was found in the proposed situations except for small swine farming methane production achieved for large size pig farms was close to the values obtained at stages iii and iv table 4 with a productivity of 203 5 nlch4 kgcodt rem 1 on the other hand the production obtained from the medium sized swine farm came close to stages i and ii with a discrepancy of 8 5 and 8 7 respectively the estimation for small size pig farms assumed a discrepancy of 40 stage iv which is not ideal if compared to the range of 10 to 30 reported elsewhere 103 104 thus small and medium sized pigs are associated with stages i and ii and large sized pigs with stages iii and iv table 7 shows relevant results reported in the literature data on regression models for estimating biogas production in anaerobic digesters in addition some of these works seek to optimize the optimal conditions to obtain better biogas volumes oliveira et al 105 proposed a generic methodology to estimate and optimize the energy potential of waste biomass however in this latter work conversion factors of animal manure to methane energy were used disregarding animal size and weight and the operating conditions variations in another study asadi et al 106 proposed modelling to estimate the biogas production rate in anaerobic digesters and optimization of suitable conditions they evaluated input parameters to develop a model by regression on the other hand donoso bravo et al 107 suggested methodologies for model definition and evaluation in ad processes the models proposed by lobato et al 65 and rosa et al 44 69 are the closest to the one proposed in the current study which were developed for domestic wastewater table 7 shows an overview of the application and performance of regression models for estimating methane generation rate in anaerobic digestion systems compared to the present work according to the literature table 7 most models were developed for specific wastewater even though there is a predominance of uasb reactors the waste characteristics and model development are different 3 3 2 fitting the mathematical model the simulation fig 5 considered a variation in the number of swine from 1 to 10 000 to better assess the model s suitability data from the three pig farms for methane production and electricity recovery were pooled with the model data table 5 the values are close to the trend line predicted by the model demonstrating an acceptable adherence the r2 was 0 85 for estimating methane and 0 95 for energy recovery both as a function of the removed loading rates showing the greatest model adherence the maximum error reached for both was 14 close to the values reported in the literature 74 115 3 3 3 system profitability the cost of kwh consumed obtained by the weighted average of peak and off peak tariffs for blue modality subgroup a2 is 0 072 us kwh 1 the cost avoided by using 100 of the recovered energy table 6 given the above a small scale pig farm which consumed full power would reduce its annual expenditure by approximately us 6522 2552 table 6 it assumes higher values for medium and large swine farms as expected table 6 therefore a relevant economy can be achieved upon methane recovery besides avoiding its release into the atmosphere in addition revenue on carbon credits could be obtained considering the commodity price of 34 76 per ton for the end of 2021 116 given this it is inferred that relatively high amounts of revenue can be achieved with this activity as a pig farm of only 250 pigs manages to raise approximately us 7315 per year the energy that can be recovered in swine farms can supply their electrical and thermal needs and there are positive environmental effects 117 if there is a good profitability probability for biogas plants projects that generate biogas of higher quality have the potential to reach a balance between 76 1 and 120 0 us kwh 1 118 however the biogas increase would demand a greater capital expenditure increasing the project and investment risks nonetheless the probabilities must be analyzed 4 conclusions a model was developed using monte carlo simulation random distribution of values in the range and several variables were considered such as the number of pigs loading contribution per pig weight reactor efficiency methane concentration cod for biomass growth and cod used for sulfate reduction the sww can be treated in a uasb reactor generating methane rich biogas the results show the feasibility of recovering methane with a yield of 260 9 nl kgcodt rem 1 and the recovery capacity of electrical energy 2 6 kwh kgcodt rem 1 the developed model allowed a better representation of the sww energy potential and its theoretical capacity for methane recovery the simulation results show that the model allowed an estimation close to reality with reduced errors r2 value of 0 934 was found to estimate methane and electric energy flow as a function of the removed load and 0 823 in terms of reactor inflow function this model was used to estimate the potential of three pig farms and the values found were significantly close to those obtained on a laboratory scale the yields achieved were also close to those reported in the literature showing a great adherence and fit to the data thus the model proved to be a relevant tool for entrepreneurship and its use can enable studies to implement energy self sufficiency projects it was also inferred that biogas plants have great potential for profitability in electricity generation and cost reduction in projects in conclusion this work presents an alternative model for estimating methane and electrical energy potential for reactors treating sww declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12662,plugging membrane filters with oil mostly n alkanes constitutes one of the main barriers to treating pw for its integration into industrial and agricultural uses a previous study shows that the combined supply of protein rich matter and co2 stimulates the activity of indigenous oil degrading microbial communities here we study the feasibility of using this stimulation method to remove dissolved oil hydrocarbons from petroleum produced water pw in storage tanks the experimental procedure consisted of vial experiments using actual pw collected from the stillwater and cushing oilfields of oklahoma usa experiments aimed to determine the kinetics and degree of oil hydrocarbon degradation assess the effect of ph and orp and elucidate the mechanism of oil degradation by the discovered stimulation method our results show that the discovered stimulation method works at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures isolated soy protein can be used as a substitute for yeast extract and hcl can be used as a substitute for na2s to reduce the orp of pw to optimum levels for oil hydrocarbon degradation our results support the hypothesis that co2 supplied as nahco3 boosts the stimulating effect of protein rich matter by removing h2 which constitutes a thermodynamic barrier for the degradation of oil hydrocarbons initial oil concentrations 0 8 1 9 mg oil l decreased by 40

water oil degradation methanogenesis protein rich matter carbon dioxide data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water produced along with oil and gas from onshore and offshore oil wells is known as petroleum produced water pw produced water is the most significant stream of water from oil and natural gas production the volume of pw is estimated to be between 15 and 20 billion barrels per year in the united states 1 this vast volume of water contains various compounds accumulated over millions of years from the geologic strata and oil among those compounds are inorganic salts metals metalloids and a wide range of oil hydrocarbon compounds the type and concentration of metals and metalloids in pw are tremendously diverse depending on the age and geology of the oil and gas formations field 2 some of them are toxic at low concentrations common toxic metals at low concentrations in pw include barium cadmium strontium arsenic lead and naturally occurring radioactive materials norm 3 common toxic oil hydrocarbons at low concentrations in pw include alkanes benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs resins and asphaltenes 4 if pw overflows or leaks from their disposal sites and pits it has the potential to penetrate and contaminate underground sources of drinking water usdw many contamination events have been reported from various significant oil producing regions worldwide 5 6 water contamination is a severe worldwide problem requiring continual examination deep well injection into saline aquifers and depleted oil reservoirs is the most common method for disposing pw 7 still it is becoming outdated due to high operational costs limited disposal capacity and more rigorous regulations the dumping of pw into deep saline aquifers has become less appealing because of the possibility of seismic danger from pw injections 8 and the upward migration of toxic metals and metalloids 9 12 the limited disposal capacity for huge volumes of pw and the limited sources of usdw are motivating initiatives to use pw to offset some of the uses of usdw 13 however for pw to be integrated into industrial and agricultural uses pw needs to be treated for salinity and toxic metals high concentrations of oil hydrocarbons are one of the main factors impeding the use of well established technologies such as membrane filtration to remove salinity and toxic metals 14 high concentrations of dissolved oil hydrocarbons in pw lead to rapid fouling of membrane filters oil hydrocarbons in pw consist primarily of large alkanes general chains of 18 34 carbons that readily plug membrane filter materials decreasing the filter permeability and increasing energy consumption fig s1 oil hydrocarbons could be removed from pw using activated sludge processes to treat sewage and conventional industrial wastewater 15 the main factor impeding the utilization of conventional biological wastewater treatment technologies is the high salinity of pw 16 salinity significantly decreases or inhibits the activity of activated sludge microbial communities 17 18 mixing pw with freshwater can be used to prevent the inhibition of activated sludge microbial communities by high salinity however this would increase the operational cost of the wastewater treatment plant to enable the removal of salinity and other organic e g btex pah and inorganic e g ba sr cd as contaminants from pw using conventional wastewater treatment technologies e g membrane filtration at an economical cost we are proposing the removal of dissolve oil hydrocarbons fig 1 by stimulating the activity of indigenous anaerobic oil degrading microbial communities that are adapted to high salinity conditions anaerobic oil biodegradation in petroleum reservoirs has been known for a long time and geochemical evidence has lately offered a clearer picture of biodegradation pathways in petroleum systems 19 20 according to data from biodegraded oils the biodegradability of common oil hydrocarbons in produced water is in the following order n alkanes monocyclic alkanes alkyl benzenes isoprenoid alkanes alkyl naphthalene bicyclic alkanes and hopanes first order alkane degradation rate constants of around 106 years have been derived from vertical compositional gradients in hydrocarbons in biodegraded petroleum columns using basic diffusion models and assuming degradation occurs proximal to the oil water contact 21 until recently only thermophilic anaerobic hydrocarbon degraders were believed to be capable of thriving in deep oil reservoirs 22 however a recent study of the thermodynamics of alkane degradation in methanogenic environments found that many ways to break down alkanes including those that involve syntrophic acetate oxidation are thermodynamically possible at mesophilic temperatures as long as hydrogen partial pressure stays low 23 following is the overall

thermodesulfobacterium and hyperthermophilic archaea thermococcus archeaoglobus 23 based on this information in a previous study we investigated the feasibility of stimulating methanogenic oil biodegradation by combining the supply of protein rich matter and co2 as nahco3 to pw collected from oklahoma s stillwater and cushing oil fields 26 27 we tested two types of protein rich matter yeast extract and isolated soy protein we found that the combined supply of co2 and protein rich matter stimulates methanogenic degradation of oil by indigenous microbial communities present in pw and that isolated soy protein can be used as a substitute for yeast extract to stimulate the methanogenic degradation of oil the findings had significant implications for coupling geological carbon storage and microbial enhanced oil recovery in depleted oil reservoirs 28 31 and for removing oil hydrocarbons from pw moreover it could reduce co2 emissions into the atmosphere if co2 captured from power plants is used instead of nahco3 however the kinetics and degree of dissolved oil hydrocarbon degradation and the impact of physicochemical variables such as temperature ph and oxidation reduction potential orp on the discovered stimulation method are still unknown to fill this knowledge gap we conducted anaerobic vial experiments of dissolved oil hydrocarbon degradation at adjusted initial orp and ph initial conditions and both mesophilic ambient and thermophilic subsurface temperatures this study hypothesizes that stimulating the activity of indigenous oil degrading microbial communities by combining the supply of protein rich matter and co2 and adjusting the physicochemical conditions temperature ph and orp of pw in enclosed anaerobic tanks can result in the complete removal of most abundant oil hydrocarbons n alkanes within shorter periods and at rates comparable to those reported for aerobic treatment e g activated sludge systems this hypothesis is tested against pw collected

anaerobic chamber in this manner was to ensure that there were no initial h2 concentrations in the vials to compensate for the ph increase caused by nahco3 1 5 ml of hcl 0 1 n was added to the solution in most cases the prepared serum vials were stripped with pure n2 gas to remove any traces of oxygen from the headspace of the vials and ensure initial anaerobic conditions 2 3 analytical

along with the pw used for experiments following the incubation period 20 ml of n hexane was added to vials and agitated for 24 h to allow appropriate extraction of dissolved hydrocarbons by n hexane a 0 5 ml of nitric acid was added to dissolve organic and inorganic materials carbonate salts to improve oil extraction from the treated pw used for gc and spectrophotometry analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the combined supply of protein rich matter and co2 to determine whether the combined supply of protein rich matter and co2 stimulate the biodegradation of dissolved oil hydrocarbons in pw we conducted vial experiments at the reservoir temperature of 50 c fig 1 shows the chromatograms of oil extracted from pw supplied with yeast extract and co2 and the corresponding control pw after 21 days of incubation the heights of the peaks in the chromatogram of pw supplied with yeast extract and co2 are shorter than in the chromatogram of the corresponding control pw confirming that the combined supply of protein rich matter and co2 stimulates the biodegradation of dissolved oil n alkanes by indigenous microbial communities adapted to high salinity conditions however it is noteworthy that the heights of the peaks decrease more for large than short alkanes due to their different biodegradability a microbial diversity analysis has been conducted to confirm fermentative oil degrading microbes in pw from the stillwater and cushing oilfields 26 3 2 effect of temperature oil degrading fermentative microbes have been reported to be more active at thermophilic temperatures 50 70 c 23 34 to determine whether the discovered stimulation method can be used at ambient temperatures in pw storage tanks we repeated the experiments at 25 c fig 2 shows the chromatograms of oil extracted from pw supplied with yeast extract and co2 and the corresponding control pw after seven days of incubation the heights of the peaks in the chromatogram are shorter than in the chromatogram of the corresponding control vial suggesting that the proposed stimulation method can also be used at ambient temperatures in pw storage tanks this result is in accordance with previous studies showing that oil hydrocarbon degradation by fermentative microbes at mesophilic and anaerobic conditions is feasible 35 however further microbial diversity analysis studies are needed to elucidate differences in dissolved oil hydrocarbons microbial dynamics at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures by the discovered stimulation method 3 3 effect of co2 yeast extract is known to stimulate the activity of microbes regardless of the supply of co2 36 yeast extract is generally used as an additive for microbial growth in microbiological studies to determine whether adding co2 has a boosting stimulating effect on the degradation rates obtained by the sole addition of protein rich matter we conducted additional experiments with and without the supply of co2 fig 3 shows the results obtained with and without the supply of co2 in accordance with previous studies suggesting that h2 accumulation can create a thermodynamic barrier for the degradation of oil hydrocarbons 23 the height of the peaks in the chromatogram are shorter with the combined supply of yeast extract and co2 than with the sole supply of yeast extract after 7 and 21 days of incubation the same trend in oil hydrocarbon degradation after 7 and 21 days of incubation confirms that co2 has a boosting stimulating effect on the degradation rate of dissolved oil hydrocarbons if supplied with the protein rich matter the concentration of ch4 formed from the reduction of co2 with h2 was below detection limits this is attributed to the relatively low amounts of dissolved oil hydrocarbons in pw h2 and ch4 production using pw collected from the stillwater and cushing oilfields could be measured in a previous study where the biodegradation of supplemented crude oil 1 ml crude oil 100 ml pw was monitored over 150 days of incubation 26 3 4 soy protein as a substitute for yeast extract in a previous study 26 we showed that isolated soy protein could be used as a substitute for yeast extract to stimulate the methanogenic degradation of crude oil to verify and quantify the stimulating effect of isolated soy protein on the activity of indigenous oil degrading microbial communities we repeated the above experiments using isolated soy protein instead of yeast extract the results fig 4 confirm that isolated soy protein can be used as a substitute for yeast extract to stimulate the biodegradation of dissolved oil hydrocarbons by indigenous microbial communities in pw based on the reduction of the area beneath the peaks 45 degradation was attained in 7 days of incubation this degradation level is comparable to the one obtained by using yeast extract 52 in 21 days fig 2 fig s3 shows a representative picture of the control pw and pw treated with isolated soy protein and co2 3 5 effect of ph and orp in addition to the availability of essential nutrients and carbon source compounds such as co2 the activity of microbes in general is also a function of the ph and orp of the reaction media the optimum ph and opr for fermentative microbes activity are acidic around 4 5 whereas the optimum ph for methanogenic microbes is about 7 0 37 39 while the optimum orp for methanogenesis is consistently reported to be negative around 400 mv the optimum orp for the fermentation of oil hydrocarbons is not very terse still it is generally said to be within the negative range around 200 mv 40 41 therefore to determine the effect of these two master chemical variables on the degradation of dissolved oil hydrocarbons by the discovered stimulation method we conducted additional experiments with and without the addition of hcl 0 2 n and or na2s to adjust the ph and or orp of pw to conditions closer to the optimum for the activity of fermentative oil degrading and methanogenic microbes these experiments were conducted in quadruple to dispel doubts regarding experimental errors co2 in the headspace of the vials was monitored to assess oil degradation without opening the vials and extracting dissolved oil hydrocarbons for gc analysis fig 5 shows representative gas chromatograms of oil extracted from pw treated with isolated soy protein and nahco3 whose ph and orp were decreased by adding hcl and or na2s fig 6 shows the corresponding average orp and oil hydrocarbon removal levels of the quadruple experiments after ten days of incubation at 50 c oil hydrocarbon removal 69 4 is highest at the intermediate orp level of 224 12 mv than at 232 57 or 193 78 mv this is opposite to what one might expect if the activity of methanogenic microbes controlled oil degradation or if low orp levels did not favor oil hydrocarbon degradation by fermentative microbes the highest oil removal levels at 224 12 mv are confirmed by the gas chromatography analysis results showing a more significant decrease in the heights of the peaks at 224 12 mv than at 232 57 and 193 78 mv fig 5 apparently low orp levels do promote oil hydrocarbon degradation but there seems to be an optimum orp level 220 mv beyond which the activity of fermentative microbes decreases due to the ph buffering effect of nahco3 the solution s ph 6 10 6 30 was practically the same at all tested conditions therefore the impact of ph is negligible on this stimulation method interestingly adding hcl resulted in a notorious reduction of orp levels comparable to the decrease in orp obtained with the addition of na2s this has important practical implications as hcl could be used as a substitute for na2s which is known to produce h2s sour gas a higher oil hydrocarbon removal levels at 232 57 and 224 12 mv than at 193 77 mv supports the hypothesis of methanogenic microbes playing the role of hydrogen scavengers to promote the degradation of oil hydrocarbons by fermentative microbial communities to elucidate the existence of an optimum orp level for the degradation of dissolved oil hydrocarbons we repeated the quadruple experiments at 25 c fig 7 shows the resulting orp levels by adding na2s and or hcl 0 2 n and attained oil removal levels after eight days of incubation the corresponding gas chromatograms are available as supplementary data in appendix a fig s4 interestingly like at 50 c the highest oil removal 62 corresponds to the intermediate orp level of 212 27 mv rather than at 107 37 55 2 or 237 37 42 7 mv the results support the finding that negative orp levels promote oil hydrocarbon degradation because an optimum orp level promotes the activity of oil degrading fermentative microbes the final degradation product of organic matter is co2 fig 8 shows the average concentration of co2 in the headspace of the quadruple vials at 25 and 50 c the highest concentrations of co2 at 50 c correspond to the highest oil removal levels obtained at 224 12 mv while the lowest concentrations of co2 correspond to the lowest oil removal levels obtained at 193 77 mv they are confirming that a portion of the degraded oil is converted to co2 and that an optimum orp level exists to promote the activity of fermentative microbes however the highest concentrations of co2 at 25 c correspond to the lowest oil removal levels obtained at 237 37 mv we speculate that this is because of temperature that might have affected the uptake of co2 by methanogens to further confirm the effects of orp on oil hydrocarbon degradation by the proposed stimulation method additional experiments were conducted using pw collected from different stillwater oilfields at both mesophilic 25 c and thermophilic 50 c temperatures the results are available as supplementary data in appendix a figs s5 and s6 3 6 kinetics of dissolved oil hydrocarbon degradation the kinetics of oil hydrocarbon degradation by the discovered stimulation method is a function of the concentrations of oil hydrocarbons the concentration of fermentative oil degrading and methanogenic microbes the concentration of nutrients protein rich matter and physicochemical conditions such as temperature ph and orp some of these variables such as the initial concentration of fermentative and methanogenic microbes are very difficult to measure and modeling the effect of other variables such as ph and orp requires additional experiments at controlled fixed ph and orp conditions therefore as a means of providing quantitative data to make pw management decisions here we estimate the specific rate coefficient of dissolved oil hydrocarbon degradation by the proposed stimulation method using the simplest form of the monod equation 42 6 r net dx dt q y s k s x bx 7 r ut ds dt q y r net 8 Î¼ q y where rnet is the rate of microbial growth rut is the rate of substrate oil hydrocarbons utilization x is the concentration of oil degrading microbes s is the concentration of dissolved oil hydrocarbons k is the concentration giving one half the maximum rate q is the specific rate of substrate utilization b is the decay coefficient of microbes y is the yield for the synthesis of microbes and Î¼ is the specific growth rate of microbes assuming that the rate of decay of microbes is negligible combining and integrating eqs 6 and 7 yield the following single algebraic equation that can be used to estimate Î¼ and k by fitting to experimental data 43 9 t 1 q k x 0 y s 0 1 y ln x 0 y s 0 ys k x 0 y s 0 ln s x 0 s 0 1 y ln x 0 where x0 and s0 are the initial concentrations of oil degrading microbes and dissolved oil hydrocarbons respectively considering the new findings showing that hcl could be used as a substitute for na2s as a reducing agent in practical applications the estimation of the specific rate coefficient is done using oil degradation data obtained with the addition of isolated soy protein nahco3 and hcl to pw collected from the cushing oilfield of oklahoma yahola 19 well the reason for choosing pw from the cushing oilfield is the relatively high concentration of dissolved oil hydrocarbons in this pw 1 92 mg oil l gas chromatography data of oil degradation at 25 and 50 c for this pw is available as supplementary data in appendix a fig s7 the concentration of dissolved oil measured with the established uv vis method correlates well with gas chromatography measurements the initial concentration of oil degrading microbes x0 2 73 108 cells l and yield for the synthesis of microbes y 1 25 108 cells mg oil were taken from a previous work we conducted on spilled dispersed oil biodegradation in the gulf of mexico 44 fig 9 compares measured and calculated concentration profiles of total dissolved hydrocarbons over time the best fit between measured and calculated concentration profiles at 50 c was obtained using Î¼ 0 614 day 1 and k 5 7 mg oil l the estimated Î¼ and k values for the degradation rate with the discovered stimulation method are similar to values reported for the aerobic degradation of a wide variety of hydrocarbons in groundwater 45 the time required to degrade oil hydrocarbons in pw under anaerobic conditions can be months to years 46 the proposed stimulation method reduces that time to around weeks 4 conclusions the combined supply of protein rich matter and co2 as nahco3 has a higher stimulation effect than the supply of protein rich matter alone on the oil hydrocarbon degradation this is due to the removal of h2 thermodynamic barrier with the supplied co2 in the form of ch4 the combined supply of protein rich matter and co2 as nahco3 stimulates the degradation of oil hydrocarbons by indigenous microbial communities present in pw at both thermophilic 50 c and mesophilic 25 c temperatures however differences in microbial diversity in the degradation of oil hydrocarbons at both temperatures are yet to be elucidated oil hydrocarbon degradation increases with the reduction of the orp of pw by adding na2s and or hcl however there is an optimum orp level beyond which the activity of fermentative microbes decreases the addition of hcl 0 2 n reduces the orp of pw salty water to levels comparable to those obtained with the addition of na2s this has important practical applications since hcl could be used as a substitute for na2s to reduce the orp of pw to optimum levels for hydrocarbon degradation the kinetics of oil hydrocarbons mostly n alkanes degradation by the studied stimulation method can be represented by the monod equation kinetic parameter values of oil hydrocarbon degradation by the discovered stimulation method are comparable to those of oil hydrocarbon degradation by aerobic degradation systems notably these conclusions are withdrawn from experiments conducted with actual pw containing natural initial microbial communities and dissolved oil hydrocarbon concentrations as such these findings have important theoretical and practical

12662,plugging membrane filters with oil mostly n alkanes constitutes one of the main barriers to treating pw for its integration into industrial and agricultural uses a previous study shows that the combined supply of protein rich matter and co2 stimulates the activity of indigenous oil degrading microbial communities here we study the feasibility of using this stimulation method to remove dissolved oil hydrocarbons from petroleum produced water pw in storage tanks the experimental procedure consisted of vial experiments using actual pw collected from the stillwater and cushing oilfields of oklahoma usa experiments aimed to determine the kinetics and degree of oil hydrocarbon degradation assess the effect of ph and orp and elucidate the mechanism of oil degradation by the discovered stimulation method our results show that the discovered stimulation method works at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures isolated soy protein can be used as a substitute for yeast extract and hcl can be used as a substitute for na2s to reduce the orp of pw to optimum levels for oil hydrocarbon degradation our results support the hypothesis that co2 supplied as nahco3 boosts the stimulating effect of protein rich matter by removing h2 which constitutes a thermodynamic barrier for the degradation of oil hydrocarbons initial oil concentrations 0 8 1 9 mg oil l decreased by 40 90 within 7 35 days the specific rate coefficient and half saturation constant to represent the kinetics of oil hydrocarbon degradation are 0 614 day 1 and 5 7 mg oil l respectively keywords produced water oil degradation methanogenesis protein rich matter carbon dioxide data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water produced along with oil and gas from onshore and offshore oil wells is known as petroleum produced water pw produced water is the most significant stream of water from oil and natural gas production the volume of pw is estimated to be between 15 and 20 billion barrels per year in the united states 1 this vast volume of water contains various compounds accumulated over millions of years from the geologic strata and oil among those compounds are inorganic salts metals metalloids and a wide range of oil hydrocarbon compounds the type and concentration of metals and metalloids in pw are tremendously diverse depending on the age and geology of the oil and gas formations field 2 some of them are toxic at low concentrations common toxic metals at low concentrations in pw include barium cadmium strontium arsenic lead and naturally occurring radioactive materials norm 3 common toxic oil hydrocarbons at low concentrations in pw include alkanes benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs resins and asphaltenes 4 if pw overflows or leaks from their disposal sites and pits it has the potential to penetrate and contaminate underground sources of drinking water usdw many contamination events have been reported from various significant oil producing regions worldwide 5 6 water contamination is a severe worldwide problem requiring continual examination deep well injection into saline aquifers and depleted oil reservoirs is the most common method for disposing pw 7 still it is becoming outdated due to high operational costs limited disposal capacity and more rigorous regulations the dumping of pw into deep saline aquifers has become less appealing because of the possibility of seismic danger from pw injections 8 and the upward migration of toxic metals and metalloids 9 12 the limited disposal capacity for huge volumes of pw and the limited sources of usdw are motivating initiatives to use pw to offset some of the uses of usdw 13 however for pw to be integrated into industrial and agricultural uses pw needs to be treated for salinity and toxic metals high concentrations of oil hydrocarbons are one of the main factors impeding the use of well established technologies such as membrane filtration to remove salinity and toxic metals 14 high concentrations of dissolved oil hydrocarbons in pw lead to rapid fouling of membrane filters oil hydrocarbons in pw consist primarily of large alkanes general chains of 18 34 carbons that readily plug membrane filter materials decreasing the filter permeability and increasing energy consumption fig s1 oil hydrocarbons could be removed from pw using activated sludge processes to treat sewage and conventional industrial wastewater 15 the main factor impeding the utilization of conventional biological wastewater treatment technologies is the high salinity of pw 16 salinity significantly decreases or inhibits the activity of activated sludge microbial communities 17 18 mixing pw with freshwater can be used to prevent the inhibition of activated sludge microbial communities by high salinity however this would increase the operational cost of the wastewater treatment plant to enable the removal of salinity and other organic e g btex pah and inorganic e g ba sr cd as contaminants from pw using conventional wastewater treatment technologies e g membrane filtration at an economical cost we are proposing the removal of dissolve oil hydrocarbons fig 1 by stimulating the activity of indigenous anaerobic oil degrading microbial communities that are adapted to high salinity conditions anaerobic oil biodegradation in petroleum reservoirs has been known for a long time and geochemical evidence has lately offered a clearer picture of biodegradation pathways in petroleum systems 19 20 according to data from biodegraded oils the biodegradability of common oil hydrocarbons in produced water is in the following order n alkanes monocyclic alkanes alkyl benzenes isoprenoid alkanes alkyl naphthalene bicyclic alkanes and hopanes first order alkane degradation rate constants of around 106 years have been derived from vertical compositional gradients in hydrocarbons in biodegraded petroleum columns using basic diffusion models and assuming degradation occurs proximal to the oil water contact 21 until recently only thermophilic anaerobic hydrocarbon degraders were believed to be capable of thriving in deep oil reservoirs 22 however a recent study of the thermodynamics of alkane degradation in methanogenic environments found that many ways to break down alkanes including those that involve syntrophic acetate oxidation are thermodynamically possible at mesophilic temperatures as long as hydrogen partial pressure stays low 23 following is the overall stoichiometry of alkane e g hexadecane degradation to ch4 h2 and co2 after dolfing larter 22 syntrophic alkane hexadecane oxidation to acetate and hydrogen 1 4 c 16 h 34 64 h 2 o 32 c h 3 co o 32 h 68

thermoanaerobacterium strains wellhead samples from a continental petroleum reservoir 1670 m depth that was never flooded yielded thermophilic bacteria thermotoga thermoanaerobacter thermodesulfobacterium and hyperthermophilic archaea thermococcus archeaoglobus 23 based on this information in a previous study we investigated the feasibility of stimulating methanogenic oil biodegradation by combining the supply of protein rich matter and co2 as nahco3 to pw collected from oklahoma s stillwater and cushing oil fields 26 27 we tested two types of protein rich matter yeast extract and isolated soy protein we found that the combined supply of co2 and protein rich matter stimulates methanogenic degradation of oil by indigenous microbial communities present in pw and that isolated soy protein can be used as a substitute for yeast extract to stimulate the methanogenic degradation of oil the findings had significant implications for coupling geological carbon storage and microbial enhanced oil recovery in depleted oil reservoirs 28 31 and for removing oil hydrocarbons from pw moreover it could reduce co2 emissions into the atmosphere if co2 captured from power plants is used instead of nahco3 however the kinetics and degree of dissolved oil hydrocarbon degradation and the impact of physicochemical variables such as temperature ph and oxidation reduction potential orp on the discovered stimulation method are still unknown to fill this knowledge gap we conducted anaerobic vial experiments of dissolved oil hydrocarbon degradation at adjusted initial orp and ph initial conditions and both mesophilic ambient and thermophilic subsurface temperatures this study hypothesizes that stimulating the activity of indigenous oil degrading microbial communities by combining the supply of protein rich matter and co2 and adjusting the physicochemical conditions temperature ph and orp of pw in enclosed anaerobic tanks can result in the complete removal of most abundant oil hydrocarbons n alkanes within shorter periods and at rates comparable to those reported for aerobic treatment e g activated sludge systems this hypothesis is tested against pw collected from oil wells in oklahoma s stillwater and cushing oilfields 2 material and methods 2 1 produced water pw samples were taken from the stillwater and the cushing oilfields in oklahoma usa the samples were used within a few days of being collected table 1 shows the chemical composition of both pws a microbial diversity analysis for both types of pw was conducted in a previous study 26 the results confirmed that methanogenic oil degrading microbial communities inhabit worldwide petroleum reservoirs 2 2 experimental procedure serum vials of 250 ml volume containing 20 ml of salt solution were

levels at 232 57 and 224 12 mv than at 193 77 mv supports the hypothesis of methanogenic microbes playing the role of hydrogen scavengers to promote the degradation of oil hydrocarbons by fermentative microbial communities to elucidate the existence of an optimum orp level for the degradation of dissolved oil hydrocarbons we repeated the quadruple experiments at 25 c fig 7 shows the resulting orp levels by adding na2s and or hcl 0 2 n and attained oil removal levels after eight days of incubation the corresponding gas chromatograms are available as supplementary data in appendix a fig s4 interestingly like at 50 c the highest oil removal 62 corresponds to the intermediate orp level of 212 27 mv rather than at 107 37 55 2 or 237 37 42 7 mv the results support the finding that negative orp levels promote oil hydrocarbon degradation because an optimum orp level promotes the activity of oil degrading fermentative microbes the final degradation product of organic matter is co2 fig 8 shows the average concentration of co2 in the headspace of the quadruple vials at 25 and 50 c the highest concentrations of co2 at 50 c correspond to the highest oil removal levels obtained at 224 12 mv while the lowest concentrations of co2 correspond to the lowest oil removal levels obtained at 193 77 mv they are confirming that a portion of the degraded oil is converted to co2 and that an optimum orp level exists to promote the activity of fermentative microbes however the highest concentrations of co2 at 25 c correspond to the lowest oil removal levels obtained at 237 37 mv we speculate that this is because of temperature that might have affected the uptake of co2 by methanogens to further confirm the effects of orp on oil hydrocarbon degradation by the proposed stimulation method additional experiments were conducted using pw collected from different stillwater oilfields at both mesophilic 25 c and thermophilic 50 c temperatures the results are available as supplementary data in appendix a figs s5 and s6 3 6 kinetics of dissolved oil hydrocarbon degradation the kinetics of oil hydrocarbon degradation by the discovered stimulation method is a function of the concentrations of oil hydrocarbons the concentration of fermentative oil degrading and methanogenic microbes the concentration of nutrients protein rich matter and physicochemical conditions such as temperature ph and orp some of these variables such as the initial concentration of fermentative and methanogenic microbes are very difficult to measure and modeling the effect of other variables such as ph and orp requires additional experiments at controlled fixed ph and orp conditions therefore as a means of providing quantitative data to make pw management decisions here we estimate the specific rate coefficient of dissolved oil hydrocarbon degradation by the proposed stimulation method using the simplest form of the monod equation 42 6 r net dx dt q y s k s x bx 7 r ut ds dt q y r net 8 Î¼ q y where rnet is the rate of microbial growth rut is the rate of substrate oil hydrocarbons utilization x is the concentration of oil degrading microbes s is the concentration of dissolved oil hydrocarbons k is the concentration giving one half the maximum rate q is the specific rate of substrate utilization b is the decay coefficient of microbes y is the yield for the synthesis of microbes and Î¼ is the specific growth rate of microbes assuming that the rate of decay of microbes is negligible combining and integrating eqs 6 and 7 yield the following single algebraic equation that can be used to estimate Î¼ and k by fitting to experimental data 43 9 t 1 q k x 0 y s 0 1 y ln x 0 y s 0 ys k x 0 y s 0 ln s x 0 s 0 1 y ln x 0 where x0 and s0 are the initial concentrations of oil degrading microbes and dissolved oil hydrocarbons respectively considering the new findings showing that hcl could be used as a substitute for na2s as a reducing agent in practical applications the estimation of the specific rate coefficient is done using oil degradation data obtained with the addition of isolated soy protein nahco3 and hcl to pw collected from the cushing oilfield of oklahoma yahola 19 well the reason for choosing pw from the cushing oilfield is the relatively high concentration of dissolved oil hydrocarbons in this pw 1 92 mg oil l gas chromatography data of oil degradation at 25 and 50 c for this pw is available as supplementary data in appendix a fig s7 the concentration of dissolved oil measured with the established uv vis method correlates well with gas chromatography measurements the initial concentration of oil degrading microbes x0 2 73 108 cells l and yield for the synthesis of microbes y 1 25 108 cells mg oil were taken from a previous work we conducted on spilled dispersed oil biodegradation in the gulf of mexico 44 fig 9 compares measured and calculated concentration profiles of total dissolved hydrocarbons over time the best fit between measured and calculated concentration profiles at 50 c was obtained using Î¼ 0 614 day 1 and k 5 7 mg oil l the estimated Î¼ and k values for the degradation rate with the discovered stimulation method are similar to values reported for the aerobic degradation of a wide variety of hydrocarbons in groundwater 45 the time required to degrade oil hydrocarbons in pw under anaerobic conditions can be months to years 46 the proposed stimulation method reduces that time to around weeks 4 conclusions the combined supply of protein rich matter and co2 as nahco3 has a higher stimulation effect than the supply of protein rich matter alone on the oil hydrocarbon degradation this is due to the removal of h2 thermodynamic barrier with the supplied co2 in the form of ch4 the combined supply of protein rich matter and co2 as nahco3 stimulates the degradation of oil hydrocarbons by indigenous microbial communities present in pw at both thermophilic 50 c and mesophilic 25 c temperatures however differences in microbial diversity in the degradation of oil hydrocarbons at both temperatures are yet to be elucidated oil hydrocarbon degradation increases with the reduction of the orp of pw by adding na2s and or hcl however there is an optimum orp level beyond which the activity of fermentative microbes decreases the addition of hcl 0 2 n reduces the orp of pw salty water to levels comparable to those obtained with the addition of na2s this has important practical applications since hcl could be used as a substitute for na2s to reduce the orp of pw to optimum levels for hydrocarbon degradation the kinetics of oil hydrocarbons mostly n alkanes degradation by the studied stimulation method can be represented by the monod equation kinetic parameter values of oil hydrocarbon degradation by the discovered stimulation method are comparable to those of oil hydrocarbon degradation by aerobic degradation systems notably these conclusions are withdrawn from experiments conducted with actual pw containing natural initial microbial communities and dissolved oil hydrocarbon concentrations as such these findings have important theoretical and practical

12663,metal organic frameworks mofs are a modern class of materials that got great academic attention over the last two decades recently serious attempts were conscripted to scale up several types of them and involve industrial applications uio 66 is a zirconium based mof that was synthesized in 2008 and widely applied in many fields since then as researchers investigated uio 66 applications this material continuously showed high performance and remarkable properties which increased the interest for further exploitation in water treatment where many mofs are utilized in various processes uio 66 is among the intensively applied ones mainly due to its high water stability however the uio 66 s stability is not limited to water it is stable in organics and acids in addition to its high thermal stability moreover uio 66 has the general mof properties of large surface area proper pore diameter large pore volume functional surface etc in this review we will focus on the use of uio 66 in membrane based water treatment processes these processes include ultrafiltration nanofiltration forward osmosis and reverse osmosis which are used for dyes heavy metals proteins and antibiotics removal as well as desalination based on database information uio 66 use in water treatment is constantly increasing due to the promising opportunities this material raises here it became necessary to explain the up to date progress in the membranes field and explore the available future aspects and aspirations of uio 66 keywords uio 66 mofs membranes desalination water treatment filtration data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction water treatment is a big concept that covers different types of processes all aim to purify water from different pollutants and impurities 1 among these processes membranes based treatments adsorption and photocatalysts are widely applied to cure water where each treatment has its appropriate use and limitations 2 however each process could have sub categories e g membranes purification technologies include but are not restricted to microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro depending on the type of existing contamination and required purity 3 these processes perform when pressure is applied to drive water from one side to another through semi permeable membranes 4 however other types of treatment processes such as adsorption and photocatalysis which are also used to cure water are relying on a different mechanism s than membranes 5 yet each process is conducted in certain circumstances and has unique features 6 to overcome the general disadvantages such as expensiveness low performance and high required energy it became necessary to use new types of materials to advance the treatment processes 7 8 metal organic frameworks mofs are a family of novel materials that continuously growing due to the great attention they receive from researchers thanks to their enormous number of structural formation possibilities and superior properties in different applications when mofs cooperated the obtained results were better than envisaged this could be attributed to their properties of high surface area tunable pores high porosity low density plenty of adsorption sites and different structures 9 mofs were firstly applied in gas storage later on they fit with many other applications including various forms of separation and filtration technologies 10 as the industrial and environmental issues are becoming more complicated in this revolutionary era the need for smart materials such as mofs has grown 11 the tunability of mofs results from the crystalline or amorphous structure that consists of cationic metals or clusters bridged together via organic linkers 12 this gave mofs infinite flexibility of configuration to form various materials where the final products could furtherly be post treated modified and modulated to achieve the advanced specifications 13 14 among mofs different types uio 66 is one of the uio mofs family that stands for the university of oslo and is widely applied in chemical catalysis photocatalyst adsorption separation sensing medicine supercapacitor and gas storage it is based on zirconium and linked with terephthalic acid where different methods were presented for its preparation but the solvothermal is the famous one 15 uio 66 is recognized for its large surface area and high thermal and water stabilities it can hold temperatures higher than 350 c in a hydrothermal environment due to the zro strong bonding that offers remarkable resistance to a wide range of solvents 16 the stabilities are credited for the metal oxide nodes that grant 12 connection points for the linker to coordinate a cuboctahedral shape crystal this large number of connections possibilities afforded remarkable functionality and tunability that led to the recent uio 66 scientific and applicable reputations 17 in addition to the mentioned properties uio 66 owns tunable and uniform pore sizes and active zro nodes thereby contributions in terms of the preparation strategies aqueous crystallization defects control topographic modification and stability functionality trade off of uio 66 are still ongoing 16 in this review we will explore the utilization of uio 66 in the membrane based water treatment processes in each process basic details and sub applications are discussed the current data of research interest shows an increase in applying this mof in membrane based techniques fig 1 shows the number of publications that contain the words uio 66 and membrane in the search field article title abstract keywords in scopus database this review is meant to discuss the up to date research to see the direction of the applications of uio 66 and predict further opportunities and obstacles 2 uio 66 plain and modified structure uio 66 is simply a crystal made of zirconium oxide nodes that are linked together with terephthalic acid 1 4 benzene dicarboxylic acid bdc bridges fig 2 shows the chemical structure of uio 66 17 among uio 66 s forms the hydroxylated one is the most stable form the structure of uio 66 crystals is the face centered cubic with an fm 3 m symmetry and lattice dimensions of 20 7 Ã¥ two framework cages can be identified tetrahedron and octahedron of 7 5 and 12 Ã¥ respectively and 6 Ã¥ pore apertures 18 the theoretically calculated surface area is 1160 m2 g and the pore volume is 0 77 cm3 g though these values varied from one work to another depending on the preparation conditions 19 based on the reticular chemistry structure resource rcsr classification the uio 66 has an fcu topology in which the inorganic node is a secondary building unit the zirconium oxide node is cuboctahedral this accorded 12 connection joints for the bdc and gave its remarked coordination in the hydroxylated uio 66 there are eight oxygens four are individually connected to three zirconium atoms and the other four are connected in the form of hydroxides 20 in order to transfer from the hydroxylated to the dehydroxylated status heat could be applied to accelerate the process where two oxygens depart the unit with hydrogens and the remaining six atoms keep linked to the zirconium atoms also a phase transition was noted when a change in the form occurred so it could couple dehydration although they are not linked simultaneously 21 uio 66 had three preparation development stages namely diffusion solvothermal and modified methods 22 the first method is also called the homogeneous phase where diffusion of the solvents occurs due to slow evaporation 23 as a result large sizes oversaturated and single crystals are produced the second approach which is commonly used now and could be termed hydrothermal offers high control on the particles size crystallinity and morphology 24 the last one contains several techniques e g supersonics mechanical grinding microwave associated and electrochemical 25 furthermore mofs could be synergized with other materials to support or improve the properties of mofs by introducing new composites hence plain and functionalized uio 66 had different synthesis approaches depending on the applied method solvent physical conditions presented chemicals and assisting modulators 16 the initially produced uio 66 used low concentrations of the metal and linker without the involvement of any modification materials where zirconium tetrachloride was dissolved with terephthalic acid in n n dimethylformamide dmf solvent the detailed preparation conditions are not mentioned here however efforts were intensified to explore methods to tune the structure and develop the synthesis 26 when large quantities of reactants are applied they interact fast and produce a gel like amorphous mof this structural form was attributed to the rapid nucleation and interconnection that do not allow long range ordering due to linkers dissociation and weak reparation 27 then a modification represented by adding modulators and or deprotonation agents took place the modulator acts as a binder to the metallic clusters that slows down the crystallization and ultimately controls the nucleation rate basically the modulator consists of a carboxylic acid linked to a hydrocarbon and takes an r cooh formula in the formula r could be hydrogen e g formic acid methyl group e g acetic acid cf3 e g trifluoroacetate benzine e g benzoic acid etc as the group is connected to the metallic node and the carboxylic acid faces shortage the crystal s growth will be limited 28 it is worth mentioning that the modulators mass should be adjusted where excess amounts could hinder the total crystallization finally the modulator could influence crystallization by affecting the zirconium s hydrolysis 29 the deprotonation agent has two functionalities nucleation initiator and ligands activator for instance triethylamine tea is a widely used deprotonating agent that removes the terephthalic acid hydrogen in order to activate nucleation 30 similar to the modulation agents once an excess amount is added the deprotonating agent will deprotonate the modulator and invalidate part of its desired functions 31 to conclude this part studies showed that the structural defects increase proportionally with increasing the modulator and deprotonating agent concentrations while the crystals size gets smaller increasing the defects in uio 66 s structure is a topic that researchers work on to improve the performance of uio 66 17 defect engineering of uio 66 was developed to overcome its inertness since it is well known that uio 66 is a highly stable material 32 here defects decrease the stability and crystallinity of uio 66 but increase the functionality modification with other materials and hydrophilicity there are two types of defects engineering the missing linker and the missing cluster 33 regarding the linkers as mentioned previously uio 66 has theoretically 12 linkers which offer a highly stable structure in the case of missing some ligands the structure was not noticeably influenced and the remaining ligands could support the crystal s framework as the number of defects increases the water and thermal resistances reduce and the lewis acid sites rise 34 on the other hand by increasing the nodes defects the pore size and surface area increase 35 based on simulation studies missing clusters defect gives a higher surface area product than missing linkers recently a new defect was raised called the charge balance defect which mainly depends on the counter ion 36 studies showed different opinions about the origin of this ion which could come from the chlorine of zirconium salt modulators medium solvent and water 37 3 uio 66 applications in membrane based techniques a number of water treatment techniques depend on membranes as keys to the purification process however the used membrane for each process has its own merits depending on the specifications of the inlet feed and final product 38 furthermore the membrane of some processes e g microfiltration could be applied as a support layer for another process e g reverse osmosis also two or more processes could be combined to treat one feed water 39 in this section we will present water treatment techniques that employed uio 66 as an improver for the properties and performance of the used membrane 3 1 ultrafiltration uf uf is the process of removing contaminations of size 30 1000 Ã¥ uio 66 was utilized in this process to improve the membrane s characterizations and performance duties mostly heavy metals proteins and dyes are removed in this process and different polymeric membranes and additives were investigated 1 however utilizing uio 66 in the uf took different roles as shown below 3 1 1 dyes removal dyes have unfavorable environmental effects and cause serious health issues hence removing them received priority 40 in this regard ma et al 41 synthesized a uio 66 graphene oxide go composite and filled it in the polyethersulfone pes to purify water from methyl orange mo and direct red 80 dr 80 dyes the performance of the membrane filled with the new composite was higher than that of pristine and go filled membranes which was assigned to the exceptional properties of uio 66 in addition to preventing the go sheets from clustering synergizing uio 66 with go was successfully achieved by crystallization and gave a wider interlayer and spacing which ultimately showed a porous structure the optimum filling ratio of uio 66 go was 3 wt it improved the water flux of the pes membrane by 78 and 351 compared with the membrane filled with go only and plain one respectively this improvement was also noticed in the contact angle values where a more hydrophilic membrane was obtained by incorporating the additives uio 66 has a remarkable aperture size of 6 Ã¥ which allows water molecules to pass through but reject the dyes 42 moreover the composite gave the advantage of rejecting the mo and dr 80 dyes in addition to the enhancement in antifouling properties 3 1 2 heavy metals hms removal of hms is also a crucial research topic for many groups that is accomplished via applying different purification techniques mainly adsorption and membranes the preference to terminate hms because of their carcinogenicity and severe negative impacts on health 43 a paper from dr deng s group discussed the use of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fiber membranes embedded with uio 66 for arsenic removal 44 this membrane showed a mix of adsorption and filtration behaviors where filling the uio 66 particles increased the adsorption capacity of the membranes in addition other properties were improved such as hydrophilicity which enhanced the water flux and antifouling properties the adsorption behavior was studied separately in a batch mode to investigate the adsorption capability of uio 66 in which calculations of the binding energy were presented using the density functional theory dft at four connection levels from calculations all binding energies were negative indicating a spontaneous binding process at all levels however among these levels the highest values were for the oxygen of zr o c it was noticed that the full protonate arsenate was achieved at very low ph values then as the ph increased the arsenate species change to highly negative charge species where these species have stronger binding energy another point to mention is the positive charge of uio 66 at phs lower than 4 which offers interaction with the negative species of arsenic chromium ion was removed by utilizing pvdf membranes loaded with two mofs nps uio 66 nh2 and zif 8 and coated with chitosan nanofibers 45 in this work the synthesized membranes were a single layer pvdf with mofs and a two layers of chitosan pvdf with mofs where the nanofibers were made using the electrospinning technique by testing different loadings of mofs the highest outputs were by using chitosan pvdf 20 uio 66 nh2 mofs by which the water flux reached to 470 lmh and the cr vi removal was 95 6 uio 66 nh2 showed a better impact on the membrane s performance than zif 8 in terms of water flux and cr vi rejection filling uio 66 nh2 in loading ratios of 10 20 and 30 wt increased the diameter of pvdf fibers from 230 nm of the pristine membrane to 265 295 and 320 nm respectively this change led to an influence on the physicochemical properties of the membrane in another work uio 66 nh2 was incorporated with the polyethyleneimine pei and filled in the pvdf membrane that was used for cr removal 46 the pei coated the mofs particles to lower their agglomeration the uio 66 nh2 was positively charged which furtherly increased the membrane s positive charge this positive charge contributed to the rejection of cr iii and cr vi ions where cr vi was adsorbed within the pores of the membrane that contains the complex and cr iii was rejected due to charge similarity and the donnan effect 3 1 3 proteins mofs application in membrane based water treatment processes is increasing due to the high affinity of mofs to integrate within the polymeric matrix structure this unique advantage cannot be attained by conventional materials it is attributed to the polymeric linkers that work on stabilizing mofs particles inside the structure while the metallic part likely works on increasing the hydrophilicity polysulfone psu membrane is frequently applied for uf purposes due to its suitable pore size tortuosity and other transportation parameters one of the psu s weak points is its hydrophobicity where its improvement results in higher water flux here when poly sulfobetaine methacrylate psbma and uio 66 were introduced into the psu the hybrid membrane synthesized by phase inversion showed an improvement of 250 compared with the plain psu membrane another form of uio 66 uio 66 nh2 was also utilized as an additive but the uio 66 psbma membrane had incomparable water flux more than double 47 this improvement in water flux was associated with an intrinsic improvement in the antifouling properties another credit is the rejection water flux trade off overcoming which is not expected when conventional additives are used generally based on the unique structure of mofs uio 66 in particular the particles showed uniform distribution and high compatibility within the membrane which ended up with a matrix of low defects moreover the uio 66 psbma composite owned a super hydrophilicity that advanced the solvent and non solvent exchange which led to the formation of hydrophilic morphology and a highly porous membrane another advantage is the hydrophilic water paths that uio 66 supplies within the membrane which facilitate the transport of water molecules in addition to the sieving process that occurs inside the particles as discussed before the psbma was the key part of the modification process it was coated around the mof nps and on the psu membrane once the coated nps are embedded in the membrane an additional affinity for adherence is created because of the psbma that exists in both materials in another study the bovine serum albumin bsa was removed by a pvdf membrane incorporated with uio 66 nps 48 the blended membranes showed better performance in terms of protein rejection and water flux compared with the plain pvdf membrane here two methods of fabricating pvdf membranes were tested and a difference in the performance was recorded one is supramolecular and the other is direct filling we like to mention that the supramolecular membrane was synthesized by adding the uio 66 s raw materials to the polymeric casting solution where an interaction between the hydrogen bonds of uio 66 ligands and fluorine f atoms of pvdf occurred while in the direct filling the mof was prepared first and then filled into the casting solution however the film prepared via supramolecular method gave the highest performance compared to the plain and directly filled membranes this manufacturing method resulted in a highly stable mechanically robust and hydrophilic structure which ultimately enhanced the water flux and rejection to understand the improvement the plain pvdf membrane had a water flux and bsa rejection of 20 lmh and 80 respectively when uio 66 was filled in the membrane at different ratios the optimum ratio was 9 52 wt in both direct filling and supramolecular scenarios at that ratio the water flux and rejection of the direct filling increased to 120 lmh and 92 while they raised to 140 lmh and 98 for the supramolecular membrane respectively this huge increase in water flux was assigned to the enrichment in hydrophilic groups and the rise in membrane s specific surface area when uio 66 was introduced to the structure further addition of uio 66 nps increased the casting solution s viscosity that ultimately raised the steric hindrance and charge interaction what is next the intermolecular forces turned to the delayed separation phase instead of the instantaneous phase and the structure became dense loose and less porous on the other side the bsa rejection had the same behavior of improvement when the mof was incorporated because of the additional adsorption sites that the mof offered up to the optimum point and then decreased because excess raw materials hindered the growth of particles in general mofs have different types and preparation routes that could give different performance results here dehghankar et al 49 prepared two mofs uio 66 and mil 101 a chromium based mof and faujasite zeolite that were filled in the pvdf using the nonsolvent induced phase separation method the upgraded membranes were examined against the bsa where a membrane embedded with 0 1 wt mil 101 showed the best water flux results of 360 lmh 111 higher than the plain membrane and protein rejection of 100 the other outcomes of this membrane were the irreversible fouling and flux recovery ratio that were estimated to be 22 2 and 77 7 respectively the best results of uio 66 embedded membranes were obtained when 0 05 wt mof was filled where the water flux and bsa rejection were 320 lmh and 98 respectively the upper performance outcomes of mil 101 than uio 66 were attributed to its higher hydrophilicity surface area and pore size which was in acceptable agreement with the literature 50 although the performance of mil 101 was higher than uio 66 the used optimum amount of mil 101 was twice that of the uio 66 the reason could be the clustering of uio 66 at high loading ratios though further research is needed to clarify this observation these hydrophilic mofs increased the surface s morphology hydrophilicity and antifouling properties and decreased the surface roughness which also contributed in increasing the antifouling properties greywater is a type of wastewater that could be treated via uf hence matebese and moutloali tested the effect of using functionalized uio 66 nh2 go composite on the pes membrane 51 the uio 66 was modified with nh2 because this group works on facilitating the reaction of mofs with the go integrates the synergizing of both materials and decreases the chance of voids generation when an activated carbon ac pretreatment step was introduced the fouling and washing steps became less however the produced water was suitable for non potable purposes of irrigation toilet fire extinguishing and construction 3 2 nanofiltration nf nf is the process of separating contaminations that size between 8 and 50 Ã¥ from a feed this process falls between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis 1 different materials were employed to improve the performance of membranes and uio 66 is among them this mof was utilized in multiple nf applications to purify different feeds as described below 3 2 1 dyes removal the dyes molecular weight differs from one to another which puts them in a wide range of molecular mass and size methylene blue mb was removed by a cellulose membrane filled with uio 66 52 the membranes were prepared by dropping a solution of uio 66 in dmf on the regenerated cellulose membrane and applying a suction filtration setup the addition of uio 66 increased the hydrophilicity and provided selective pathways where an aperture size of 6 Ã¥ fitted with the application s requirements here the prepared membrane performance was superior compared to the commercial membrane furthermore a similar membrane was prepared via filling tio2 in the cellulose membrane and was compared with the mof membrane the tio2 membrane showed good flux but poor rejection which was attributed to the formation of interparticle voids that sized between 30 and 50 nm these wide voids are not able to retain the mb and the dye s molecules passed through another reason is that tio2 blocks the adsorption sites of the polymeric substrate which could also contribute to rejection deterioration the size of uio 66 was perfect for filling the average size was 50 nm while smaller particles of 10 nm size stocked within the pathways and offered selective filtration in addition to the high performance characteristics that uio 66 owns modifications could be made to further improve its specifications on the other hand partially reduced go prgo showed a remarkable performance in water treatment applications thereby zhang et al 53 intercalated the modified uio 66 with a carboxylic group cooh and the prgo to prepare a uio 66 cooh 2 prgo membrane which proved its superior efficiency compared with the pristine prgo membrane in low pressure nanofiltration process the novel composite gave a higher cavity for water molecules and a selective structure that reject the dyes efficiently regardless of the charge of the dye the water flux of the hybrid membrane was around triple times higher than the prgo membrane when equal amounts of the materials were used in membranes preparation it reached 20 0 2 5 lmh bar also dyes rejection was examined using positive methylene blue and negative congo red charged dyes where the rejections were 95 1 and 97 2 respectively these rejection values were also higher than the pristine prgo membrane which could be attributed to the additional surface charge the uio nh2 granted it is worth mentioning that the membranes were prepared by the simple assembly filtration method based on accumulating the particles on a filter that roles as a support for the generated filter the generated films were 300 nm thick and an ultrasonic pre step for the raw materials solutions was applied to grant a uniform distribution 3 2 2 heavy metals removal heavy metal removal has many purposes mainly to eliminate their harmful effects while precious heavy metals can be collected and reused the uio 66 cooh 2 prgo membrane described in the previous section 53 was employed to remove the divalent positive ions of cu and cd the rejection values of these ions decreased as their initial concentration increased however the uio 66 cooh 2 prgo membrane performance was better than the plain prgo one in terms of heavy metals removal and water flux when the concentration of cd 2 was 0 1 mm the prgo membrane s rejection was 57 0 which gradually decreased as the feed concentration increased when a 0 5 mm feed solution was used the rejection reached to 33 2 and the water flux was 4 6 2 1 lmh bar when the mof modified membrane was used to treat a 0 1 mm cd 2 feed solution the rejection raised to 92 6 this ratio decreased to 80 4 when a 0 5 mm feed solution was utilized all removal ratios of the mof modified membrane were higher and the water flux was 21 7 1 1 which is 4 72 times greater than the prgo membrane a similar observation was noticed when copper cu 2 was studied when a feed solution of 0 1 mm was used the removal ratios increased from 65 4 for the prgo membrane to 96 5 for the mof modified one when a 0 5 mm solution was used the copper ion rejection ratios were 44 5 for the prgo and 83 1 for uio 66 cooh 2 prgo however water fluxes were 5 2 1 7 lmh bar and 22 3 1 4 lmh bar for the prgo and uio 66 cooh 2 prgo membranes respectively which indicates an improvement of 4 3 times as mentioned above metal filtration could have purposes other than the removal of harmful metals some metals are valuable and need to be separated and reused in this regard aghili et al 54 prepared tfn membranes filled with nano gel uio 66 nh2 and supported with polyethyleneimine pei that were operated for separating the mono and multi violent ions when 1 wt of the gel was added the performance reached its maximum in terms of permeability and selectivity for two solutions of mg2 li and mg2 na the separation factor was 33 of mg2 li and the permeability reached up to 30 6 lmh bar this was attributed to the presence of the amine group in the mof that generated a vital layer with a positive charge which could aid the removal or separation of cations as the test was conducted for two days li ion recovery showed high stability 3 2 3 desalination there are different forms of desalination processes such as thermal electrical and membrane based in particular the membranes based processes take different forms depending on the properties of salt ions required to be separated nanofiltration commonly is an excellent process to remove the divalent but not the monovalent ions in contrast other types of processes fit the desire to remove the mono ions as will be described in a later section in this regard nanofiltration membranes filled with uio 66 nanoparticles or their derivatives have been investigated and compared with other membranes the preparation of 15 nm sized uio 66 nh2 nps and filling them within the thin polyamide layer were studied by gong et al 55 the reaction was conducted on a polydopamine wrapped single carbon nanotube cnt sheet this very thin support layer produced the thinnest tfn membrane where the total thickness of the whole composite was 20 3 during the membrane s preparation a pes microfiltration membrane was used to accumulate the components and was kept as a support sheet for the whole assembly a divalent na2so4 salt solution was utilized to examine the tfn membrane and rejection and water flux values of 97 1 and 46 lmh bar respectively were obtained the water flux of the mof modified membrane was 1 5 times higher than the plane membrane also the membrane showed high stability in terms of permeability and na2so4 rejection when tested for three days the outcomes of this research were higher than other similar works when compared in terms of na2so4 rejection and water flux in fact during this work five salts were tested and the salt rejection followed this order na2so4 97 1 mgso4 91 2 mgcl2 45 8 cacl2 40 8 and nacl 8 1 the rejection of divalent salts is higher than the monovalent which was imputed for two reasons the size sieving and the donnan effect by considering the exceptional outcomes that uio 66 offers its influence on nf membranes was compared to molybdenum disulfide mos2 nanosheets and gold au nanorods by gao et al 56 it was found that the loading density size and shape of the fillers have influential roles in their distribution within the synthesized membrane in the report the nps were forcedly dispersed within an aqueous solution of piperazine pip by ultrasonic which then yielded uniformly distributed additives in the membrane due to the micro wrinkled morphology this wrinkled surface increased the active area of contact and ultimately the hydrophilicity water flux and antifouling which maintained the divalent salt ions rejection high when the modified membranes were tested for 120 h the na2so4 rejection was always 97 which was attributed to the additional negative charge that membranes gained due to filling additives furthermore the tfn membranes embedded with mos2 uio 66 and au of 15 Î¼g cm2 filling density showed water flux of 18 0 16 8 and 16 0 lmh bar respectively these values have been improved compared with the pristine tfn membrane 9 6 lmh bar which was attributed to the improvement in hydrophilicity and reduction in cross linking it is notable to mention that when the test was conducted for 120 h the water flux of all membranes was slightly decreased nevertheless the uio 66 filled membrane was the highly stable one the last work to present is a comparison of performance between different types of mofs that were synthesized using different ionic liquids ils namely choline dioctyl sulfosuccinate cho aot r limonene rl and ethylene glycol eg ethanol ammonium formate eoaf the three ils ruled as an emulsifier nonpolar phase and polar organic solvent respectively these microemulsions ils were employed as nanoreactors to prepare suitable nanosized mil 53 al zif 8 hkust 1 and uio 66 nh2 57 the nf membrane was prepared by reacting the pip with tmc and supported with a pan sheet the uio 66 nh2 showed the lowest surface area 259 70 m2 g while it was 513 15 m2 g for the mil 53 al 738 4 m2 g for the hkust 1 and 1079 43 m2 g for the zif 8 although the uio 66 nh2 membrane showed the lowest contact angle and surface roughness of 32 1 0 5 and 9 6 0 5 sa respectively the important specifications are the performance ones salt rejection and water flux where the filled membranes were tested with three feed solutions 1000 ppm mgso4 2000 ppm na2so4 and 2000 ppm nacl using a driving pressure of 150 psi table 1 below illustrates the water flux and salt rejection of the membranes where the uio 66 membrane shows the best results hence the importance of using the uio 66 and its derivatives appears clear in this comparison there are general scenarios associated with the nf process that explain the rejection behavior of the commonly used salts however it can be stated that ions naturally pass the membrane through their counterions due to charge balancing laws these scenarios are 1 for na2so4 the highly utilized salt for nf membranes testing is the na2so4 in which the so4 2 ion owns a higher electrical charge and diameter than na thereby the sulfate ion dominates the transfer phenomenon where membranes could be prepared with a high negative charge to obtain high rejection by repulsing this ion by the donnan and dielectric effects in addition to the molecular sieving 58 2 for mgso4 the dielectric repulsion of nf membranes against the mgso4 ions is high since its cat and an ions have considerable charges furthermore both mg and so4 ions are relatively large so sieving also affects the ions transport moreover since the charges of both ions are close to each other the negative membrane could re pull anions in the same magnitude of attracting cations as a result the electrostatic effect is equivalent at the surface of the membrane here the mg2 ion rejection is lower than na ion due to the higher electrostatic attraction between the magnesium ion and membrane s surface than sodium 59 3 for cacl2 and mgcl2 these salts have divalent cations that equalized with two monovalent anions where of course the cation s stokes radius is greatly bigger as the nf is applied the process is dominated by cation retention hence the filtration process depends on sieving the cations that are attracted by the membrane and retaining the chlorine ions due to the dielectric impact improving the nf membranes by filling different additives particularly uio 66 in this work within the membrane s textile increases the membrane pore size and decreases the cross linking consequently the salt rejection decreases 4 for nacl it is usually considered in the nf process to study the ability of the membrane in removing the monovalent ions which is commonly very low compared with the other divalent salts filling nps in the membrane could not improve the rejection to an acceptable level instead it could decrease the rejection due to the loss in crosslinking and the generation of additional transport channels that nps provide when added 56 3 3 forward osmosis forward osmosis fo is an osmotically driven membrane process that uses osmotic pressure as an operating force to treat water that contains undesired dissolved ions fo process has been examined in various applications such as water desalination 60 wastewater reclamation oilfield produced water treatment and food industry 61 most of the state of the art fo research focuses on preparing a suitable membrane for the process typically fo thin film composite tfc membranes consist of two layers a supporting layer that gives the membrane its mechanical integrity and an active layer that gives the membrane its selectivity 62 the polyamide selective layer is typically prepared via the interfacial polymerization reaction between m phyenelendiamene mpd and trimsoyl chloride tmc 63 incorporating nanoparticles in either the support or active layer has been a subject of much recent research where the fo process was utilized in several applications as illustrated below 3 3 1 antibiotics wastewaters from hospitals and pharmaceutical factories deliver significant amounts of antibiotics to the environment these harmful substances can cause negative effects on human health and aquatic life fo has the potential to treat antibiotics from wastewater that was proved in several studies some of these studies focused on incorporating uio 66 nps within the tfc tfn membranes and their performance in antibiotics treatment for instance uio 66 was embedded in different ratios 0 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 wt in a psu support layer that was made by the electrospinning technique 64 the electrospun substrate nanofibers were prepared by dissolving 26 psu in dmf while the polyamide layer was formed by the ip reaction the prepared tfn membranes were tested to remove six antibiotics sulfamethoxazole smz sulfamethazine sm2 trimethoprim tmp erythromycin em chloramphenicol cl and tetracycline tc when the 0 5 wt uio 66 membrane was used to treat the antibiotic wastewater the water flux reached to 50 78 lmh an increase of 46 compared with the plain membrane and the rejection rates for all antibiotics maintained 99 9 fig 3 shows the sem and tem images of uio 66 filled psu support layers another way to utilize the uio 66 in fo is by filling it into the thin active layer here guo et al investigated the performance of the tfc fo membrane incorporated with uio 66 nh2 to reject tetracycline tc and tetracycline resistance genes trgs 65 the support layer was prepared via the electrospinning process of polyurethane psu at different ratios 0 100 10 90 20 80 or 30 70 where the 20 80 support sheet showed the best performance results showed that a tc rejection of 99 64 was estimated when 0 075 wt of the nps were filled in another work guo et al studied the effect of cu2 concentration on the removal of tc and trgs using tfc fo membranes embedded with uio 66 nh2 that were prepared in their study mentioned above 66 results revealed that the rejections of tc and cu2 were 99 53 and 97 99 respectively however the rejection of trgs was about 90 at a cu2 concentration of 500 Î¼g l when 0 5 m nh4 2hpo4 was used as a draw solution the high rejection is attributed to the complexation reaction between cu2 and tc the adsorption of cu2 on the membrane surface and the electrostatic interaction 3 3 2 heavy metals heavy metals are considered one of the major hazardous materials that are discharged into the environment due to various industrial activities 43 67 these materials should be minimized down to a certain level before discharging into the environment fo membranes have the ability to reject hms ions in different ratios depending on the targeted element s properties uio 66 nps were added to the fo membranes to enhance their performance in hms removal the removal of arsenic ions from a 100 ppm feed water via fo membranes embedded with uio 66 nps was studied 68 where the mof was filled within the psu support layer with a ratio of 0 5 the membranes showed arsenic rejection and water flux of 87 5 and 5 8 lmh respectively another incorporation method is by filling uio 66 in the thin film here eghbalazar and shakeri investigated this membrane to treat 2000 ppm cu 2 aqueous solution 69 the uio 66 nps were coated with polydopamine to enhance their dispersion in the mpd aqueous solution this approach resulted in improving the physicochemical properties surface chemical composition hydrophilicity morphology and roughness of the tfc fo membranes in terms of fo performance the synthesized membrane showed a water flux of 22 2 lmh and cu rejection of 97 9 in another study the removal of chromium cr 3 was investigated using tfc membranes embedded with uio 66 nh2 70 the aminated uio 66 nps were incorporated in the mpd solution before reacting with the tmc to make the thin polyamide layer the tfc membrane filled with 800 ppm of uio 66 nh2 nanofiller showed the best results in terms of higher hydrophilicity and cr 3 rejection the stability and the agglomeration of mof nps in the polyamide layer are issues that really affect hms rejection however it was found that modifying the uio 66 nps can overcome the abovementioned issues he et al prepared sulfonated graphene oxide sgo which is a two dimensional structure nanomaterial with a large number of carboxyl sulfonic acid and epoxy groups and used it to modify the uio 66 nps 71 the modification of uio 66 nps involved the coordinating effect between oxygen containing functional groups and metal ions to uniformly distribute zirconium ions on the sgo layer the adhesion between the nanomaterial and membrane was improved due to the hydrogen bonding and chemical interactions between sgo uio 66 and mpd the prepared membrane was tested in heavy metals i e cu and pb removal of a 2000 ppm feed solution within 2 h operation 99 4 removal rate was acquired and after 10 h it maintained 97 5 indicating the stability of the sgo uio 66 tfc fo membrane 3 3 3 desalination the fo process has been widely used in desalination as an effective and economical method compared to the other traditional desalination methods such as reverse osmosis the utilization of fo for this purpose was investigated by many groups including ours where many approaches were followed to improve the membrane s performance 72 filling uio 66 nps in the pa membrane for desalination via fo was investigated they can be added either in the mpd aqueous solution or in the tmc organic solution the uio 66 f 4 made by using the linker f4 bdc nps were synthesized and incorporated into the mpd solution with loading ratios from 0 05 to 0 5 wt 73 increasing the filling ratio to 0 5 wt within the tfn membrane lowered the contact angle from 93 9 of the plain membrane to 71 7 the highest water flux in the pro pressure retarded osmosis mode i e support layer facing the feed solution was 54 7 lmh that was obtained by loading 0 1 wt of the mof at this condition the reverse salt flux was 15 7 gmh in another study uio 66 nps were embedded in the tmc organic solution of concentrations 0 05 to 0 2 wt 74 the prepared tfn membranes possessed super hydrophilic surfaces with contact angles lower than 30 the best fo membrane was obtained with a loading ratio of 0 1 wt where it showed a water flux of 51 lmh and 27 lmh in the pro and fo modes respectively however a moderate reverse salt flux was observed for the optimum membrane of 12 3 gmh in the pro mode and 6 1 gmh in the fo mode similarly wang and coworkers used a different approach to incorporate uio 66 nps into the polyamide layer after dispersing them in hexane at different concentrations i e 0 0025 0 005 0 025 and 0 05 wt 75 this step was conducted after covering the polysulfone support layer with mpd and before pouring the tmc solution which led to prepare a uio 66 decorated interlayer even at a much low mof uio 66 loading percentage the decorated interlayer revealed significantly improved water flux two times higher and reduced the structural parameter decrease by about 50 compared with the conventionally uio 66 embedded tfn membrane uio 66 nps can be modified to improve their properties before incorporating them within the fo membranes as an example graphene quantum dots gqds were used to modify the uio 66 nh2 nps 76 the gqds uio 66 nh2 nps have been added to the mpd solution at concentrations of 100 200 250 and 500 ppm the obtained tfn membranes exhibited superior properties in terms of hydrophilicity morphology and roughness the highest water flux was acquired for the membrane filled with 250 ppm gqds uio 66 nh2 to be 59 lmh and 85 lmh in the fo and pro modes respectively also the selectivity of this membrane was 1 5 times higher than the control tfc membrane another option is to incorporate the uio 66 in the support layer this option can change the thermodynamic properties and the kinetic conditions e g the morphology chemistry structure and wettability of the polymeric solution thus altering the phase inversion pathway 77 the results showed that the interfacial polymerization reaction was improved due to the addition of uio 66 nps in the substrate where the best loading ratio was 6 5 wt moreover it was concluded that adding uio 66 to the support layer resulted a significant reduction in the internal concentration effect similarly arjmandi and colleagues studied the effect of adding uio 66 nps to the polyether sulfone support layer to control the negative impact of the internal concentration polarization 78 3 4 reverse osmosis reverse osmosis is a pressure driven membrane process where hydraulic pressure is applied to overcome the osmotic pressure of a saline feed and force the freshwater to pass through the ro membrane typically ro is the most popular process for desalination due to its economical operation compared with other thermal electrical processes 79 similar to the fo process the dominant membrane in this technique is the tfc membrane zhao et al used a spraying nozzle to incorporate uio 66 nh2 nps into the polysulfone support layer before performing the ip reaction between mpd and tmc 80 the uio 66 nh2 was dispersed in ethanol at a percent of 0 02 wt while the time of spraying varied from 1 to 10 min to control the amount of spraying solution the prepared membranes were tested to desalinate brackish and sea water via using nacl feed solution of 2000 ppm and 32 000 ppm concentration respectively as the spraying duration increased the surface coverage of the uio 66 nh2 nps increased after 5 min clusters of the nps were observed as seen in fig 4 ro performance tests showed that the tfn membrane with a spraying time of 3 min exhibited the best water flux and salt rejection results also the tfn membranes showed better chlorine resistance compared to the pristine tfc membranes in a previous study in our group ro membranes embedded with uio 66 and mil 125 a titanium based mof were prepared and compared at a similar particle size of 100 nm 81 results revealed that uio 66 and mil 125 could enhance the membrane s performance and the impacts mainly depended on the mofs loading both mof nanoparticles i e uio 66 and mil 125 showed comparable performance in the desalination of brackish water with a salt rejection of 98 5 it is good to mention that the optimum filling ratio of uio 66 was 0 15 and of mil 125 was 0 3 however mil 125 filled membranes showed higher performance another approach to synthesizing membranes is by preparing a mof membrane yet as the ro process uses a high hydraulic pressure and the strength of the polycrystalline mof membranes is not high enough this membrane was not widely applied however a seed assisted solvothermal synthesis method on a porous alumina ceramic tube was used to prepare a dense continuous uio 66 membrane 82 the manufactured membranes were tested for various salts desalination i e kcl nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 for 180 h continuously the results showed that high rejection of divalent ions 82 for ca and 98 for mg was achieved while lower rejection values were observed for the monovalent ions 45 8 for k and 49 8 for na these findings confirm that the prepared uio 66 membranes with this method have a nanofiltration nature although adding nanomaterials to the tfc membranes leads to better permeability they may have a negative effect on the selectivity this is attributed to the agglomeration of nanomaterials and low compatibility between the nanomaterials and polyamide matrix in order to overcome these issues tannic acid was used as shown in fig 5 to modify the uio 66 nh2 nanoparticles before incorporating them into the polyamide layer 83 the resulting tfn membranes with tannic acid exhibited a significant increase in water permeability compared to both conventional tfc and plain uio 66 nh2 incorporated tfn membranes also due to the bridging effects of tannic acid the upgraded membranes showed higher salt rejections than plain uio 66 nh2 membranes in brackish and seawater desalination finally liu et al studied the performance of the tfn uio 66 nh2 membranes in boron removal from seawater 84 the optimum uio 66 nh2 concentration was found to be 0 05 which showed a 50 increase in water flux and a significant boron rejection compared to the conventional tfc membranes 4 future prospective according to the recent progress and applications of uio 66 it is anticipated to have further utilization in terms of membrane based water treatment techniques the following points could be observed in the near future 1 it is known that many mofs have been manufactured and their number is increasing however modifying the mof itself gives new properties and functions in the uio 66 case there are many upgraded forms as mentioned throughout the above sections uio 66 nh2 could be the most popular form in water treatment applications due to its remarkable merits integrating uio 66 with new groups could propose a structure with new advantageous functions 2 new uio 66 composites could be synthesized by incorporating the mof with other materials here we like to mention two examples of this type of composite first is the use of multilayered ti3c2tx mxene with uio 66 cooh 2 to fabricate a ti3c2tx uio 66 cooh 2 membrane that was employed in polluted oil water emulsion separation 85 the other example is the integration of uio 66 with graphene oxide where xiao et al modified the uio 66 nh2 with perylene 3 4 9 10 tetracarboxylic dianhydride and filled it with the go to prepare a novel membrane used for dye wastewater treatment 86 in another work uio 66 nh2 go was filled in the polyethersulfone membrane and used to cure the greywater 51 in all previous cases the synergized uio 66 showed superior results compared with the plain structure 3 designing the appropriate form of uio 66 for the desired application is another area of investigation in membranes there are many physicochemical properties that affect the overall performance for instance reverse osmosis and membrane distillation md are desalination methods however the ro requires a hydrophilic membrane while the md requires a hydrophobic membrane here if uio 66 is utilized in the md the hydrophilicity should be engineered to suit the application we like to mention that a hydrophobic uio 66 was already produced by using naphthyl ligands 87 4 the uio 66 membrane could be one of the next generation membranes used for water treatment processes where this membrane is consisted of a uio 66 layer and supported by another material however some processes such as reverse osmosis need to apply high pressure but this type of membrane cannot hold it finding methods to consolidate the uio 66 layer and tolerate the applied pressure could leap desalination due to the unique pore size of uio 66 that could sieve water from saline 5 conclusion by surveying the previous literature it can be concluded that uio 66 has been successfully utilized in membrane based water treatment processes that are applied to treat water from a wide range of contaminations in general the uio 66 and its derivatives were incorporated within the membranes to improve their performance and properties the membrane s performance is usually expressed by the water flux and contaminants rejection where uio 66 mainly enhanced the water flux in uf nf fo and ro applications due to its remarkable hydrophilicity the rejection was also increased due to the sieving pore size of uio 66 that could selectively filter water molecules from pollutants even salts ions other properties influence other parameters for instance uio 66 usually increases the membrane s hydrophilicity that ultimately enhances the antifouling property uio 66 s functional group s could contribute to engineering the membrane to fulfill the desired application in the future we anticipate a continuous progress in utilizing uio 66 for membrane based water treatment processes also there is still a wide area of research to investigate new scopes of uio 66 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no known conflict in this work acknowledgment the authors like to thank their affiliations funding none 
12663,metal organic frameworks mofs are a modern class of materials that got great academic attention over the last two decades recently serious attempts were conscripted to scale up several types of them and involve industrial applications uio 66 is a zirconium based mof that was synthesized in 2008 and widely applied in many fields since then as researchers investigated uio 66 applications this material continuously showed high performance and remarkable properties which increased the interest for further exploitation in water treatment where many mofs are utilized in various processes uio 66 is among the intensively applied ones mainly due to its high water stability however the uio 66 s stability is not limited to water it is stable in organics and acids in addition to its high thermal stability moreover uio 66 has the general mof properties of large surface area proper pore diameter large pore volume functional surface etc in this review we will focus on the use of uio 66 in membrane based water treatment processes these processes include ultrafiltration nanofiltration forward osmosis and reverse osmosis which are used for dyes heavy metals proteins and antibiotics removal as well as desalination based on database information uio 66 use in water treatment is constantly increasing due to the promising opportunities this material raises here it became necessary to explain the up to date progress in the membranes field and explore the available future aspects and aspirations of uio 66 keywords uio 66 mofs membranes desalination water treatment filtration data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction water treatment is a big concept that covers different types of processes all aim to purify water from different pollutants and impurities 1 among these processes membranes based treatments adsorption and photocatalysts are widely applied to cure water where each treatment has its appropriate use and limitations 2 however each process could have sub categories e g membranes purification technologies include but are not restricted to microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro depending on the type of existing contamination and required purity 3 these processes perform when pressure is applied to drive water from one side to another through semi permeable membranes 4 however other types of treatment processes such as adsorption and photocatalysis which are also used to cure water are relying on a different mechanism s than membranes 5 yet each process is conducted in certain circumstances and has unique features 6 to overcome the general disadvantages such as expensiveness low performance and high required energy it became necessary to use new types of materials to advance the treatment processes 7 8 metal organic frameworks mofs are a family of novel materials that continuously growing due to the great attention they receive from researchers thanks to their enormous number of structural formation possibilities and superior properties in different applications when mofs cooperated the obtained results were better than envisaged this could be attributed to their properties of high surface area tunable pores high porosity low density plenty of adsorption sites and different structures 9 mofs were firstly applied in gas storage later on they fit with many other applications including various forms of separation and filtration technologies 10 as the industrial and environmental issues are becoming more complicated in this revolutionary era the need for smart materials such as mofs has grown 11 the tunability of mofs results from the crystalline or amorphous structure that consists of cationic metals or clusters bridged together via organic linkers 12 this gave mofs infinite flexibility of configuration to form various materials where the final products could furtherly be post treated modified and modulated to achieve the advanced specifications 13 14 among mofs different types uio 66 is one of the uio mofs family that stands for the university of oslo and is widely applied in chemical catalysis photocatalyst adsorption separation sensing medicine supercapacitor and gas storage it is based on zirconium and linked with terephthalic acid where different methods were presented for its preparation but the solvothermal is the famous one 15 uio 66 is recognized for its large surface area and high thermal and water stabilities it can hold temperatures higher than 350 c in a hydrothermal environment due to the zro strong bonding that offers remarkable resistance to a wide range of solvents 16 the stabilities are credited for the metal oxide nodes that grant 12 connection points for the linker to coordinate a cuboctahedral shape crystal this large number of connections possibilities afforded remarkable functionality and tunability that led to the recent uio 66 scientific and applicable reputations 17 in addition to the mentioned properties uio 66 owns tunable and uniform pore sizes and active zro nodes thereby contributions in terms of the preparation strategies aqueous crystallization defects control topographic modification and stability functionality trade off of uio 66 are still ongoing 16 in this review we will explore the utilization of uio 66 in the membrane based water treatment processes in each process basic details and sub applications are discussed the current data of research interest shows an increase in applying this mof in membrane based techniques fig 1 shows the number of publications that contain the words uio 66 and membrane in the search field article title abstract keywords in scopus database this review is meant to discuss the up to date research to see the direction of the applications of uio 66 and predict further opportunities and obstacles 2 uio 66 plain and modified structure uio 66 is simply a crystal made of zirconium oxide nodes that are linked together with terephthalic acid 1 4 benzene dicarboxylic acid bdc bridges fig 2 shows the chemical structure of uio 66 17 among uio 66 s forms the hydroxylated one is the most stable form the structure of uio 66 crystals is the face centered cubic with an fm 3 m symmetry and lattice dimensions of 20 7 Ã¥ two framework cages can be identified tetrahedron and octahedron of 7 5 and 12 Ã¥ respectively and 6 Ã¥ pore apertures 18 the theoretically calculated surface area is 1160 m2 g and the pore volume is 0 77 cm3 g though these values varied from one work to another depending on the preparation conditions 19 based on the reticular chemistry structure resource rcsr classification the uio 66 has an fcu topology in which the inorganic node is a secondary building unit the zirconium oxide node is cuboctahedral this accorded 12 connection joints for the bdc and gave its remarked coordination in the hydroxylated uio 66 there are eight oxygens four are individually connected to three zirconium atoms and the other four are connected in the form of hydroxides 20 in order to transfer from the hydroxylated to the dehydroxylated status heat could be applied to accelerate the process where two oxygens depart the unit with hydrogens and the remaining six atoms keep linked to the zirconium atoms also a phase transition was noted when a change in the form occurred so it could couple dehydration although they are not linked simultaneously 21 uio 66 had three preparation development stages namely diffusion solvothermal and modified methods 22 the first method is also called the homogeneous phase where diffusion of the solvents occurs due to slow evaporation 23 as a result large sizes oversaturated and single crystals are produced the second approach which is commonly used now and could be termed hydrothermal offers high control on the particles size crystallinity and morphology 24 the last one contains several techniques e g supersonics mechanical grinding microwave associated and electrochemical 25 furthermore mofs could be synergized with other materials to support or improve the properties of mofs by introducing new composites hence plain and functionalized uio 66 had different synthesis approaches depending on the applied method solvent physical conditions presented chemicals and assisting modulators 16 the initially produced uio 66 used low concentrations of the metal and linker without the involvement of any modification materials where zirconium tetrachloride was dissolved with terephthalic acid in n n dimethylformamide dmf solvent the detailed preparation conditions are not mentioned here however efforts were intensified to explore methods to tune the structure and develop the synthesis 26 when large quantities of reactants are applied they interact fast and produce a gel like amorphous mof this structural form was attributed to the rapid nucleation and interconnection that do not allow long range ordering due to linkers dissociation and weak reparation 27 then a modification represented by adding modulators and or deprotonation agents took place the modulator acts as a binder to the metallic clusters that slows down the crystallization and ultimately controls the nucleation rate basically the modulator consists of a carboxylic acid linked to a hydrocarbon and takes an r cooh formula in the formula r could be hydrogen e g formic acid methyl group e g acetic acid cf3 e g trifluoroacetate benzine e g benzoic acid etc as the group is connected to the metallic node and the carboxylic acid faces shortage the crystal s growth will be limited 28 it is worth mentioning that the modulators mass should be adjusted where excess amounts could hinder the total crystallization finally the modulator could influence crystallization by affecting the zirconium s hydrolysis 29 the deprotonation agent has two functionalities nucleation initiator and ligands activator for instance triethylamine tea is a widely used deprotonating agent that removes the terephthalic acid hydrogen in order to activate nucleation 30 similar to the modulation agents once an excess amount is added the deprotonating agent will deprotonate the modulator and invalidate part of its desired functions 31 to conclude this part studies showed that the structural defects increase proportionally with increasing the modulator and deprotonating agent concentrations while the crystals size gets smaller increasing the defects in uio 66 s structure is a topic that researchers work on to improve the performance of uio 66 17 defect engineering of uio 66 was developed to overcome its inertness since it is well known that uio 66 is a highly stable material 32 here defects decrease the stability and crystallinity of uio 66 but increase the functionality modification with other materials and hydrophilicity there are two types of defects engineering the missing linker and the missing cluster 33 regarding the linkers as mentioned previously uio 66 has theoretically 12 linkers which offer a highly stable structure in the case of missing some ligands the structure was not noticeably influenced and the remaining ligands could support the crystal s framework as the number of defects increases the water and thermal resistances reduce and the lewis acid sites rise 34 on the other hand by increasing the nodes defects the pore size and surface area increase 35 based on simulation studies missing clusters defect gives a higher surface area product than missing linkers recently a new defect was raised called the charge balance defect which mainly depends on the counter ion 36 studies showed different opinions about the origin of this ion which could come from the chlorine of zirconium salt modulators medium solvent and water 37 3 uio 66 applications in membrane based techniques a number of water treatment techniques depend on membranes as keys to the purification process however the used membrane for each process has its own merits depending on the specifications of the inlet feed and final product 38 furthermore the membrane of some processes e g microfiltration could be applied as a support layer for another process e g reverse osmosis also two or more processes could be combined to treat one feed water 39 in this section we will present water treatment techniques that employed uio 66 as an improver for the properties and performance of the used membrane 3 1 ultrafiltration uf uf is the process of removing contaminations of size 30 1000 Ã¥ uio 66 was utilized in this process to improve the membrane s characterizations and performance duties mostly heavy metals proteins and dyes are removed in this process and different polymeric membranes and additives were investigated 1 however utilizing uio 66 in the uf took different roles as shown below 3 1 1 dyes removal dyes have unfavorable environmental effects and cause serious health issues hence removing them received priority 40 in this regard ma et al 41 synthesized a uio 66 graphene oxide go composite and filled it in the polyethersulfone pes to purify water from methyl orange mo and direct red 80 dr 80 dyes the performance of the membrane filled with the new composite was higher than that of pristine and go filled membranes which was assigned to the exceptional properties of uio 66 in addition to preventing the go sheets from clustering synergizing uio 66 with go was successfully achieved by crystallization and gave a wider interlayer and spacing which ultimately showed a porous structure the optimum filling ratio of uio 66 go was 3 wt it improved the water flux of the pes membrane by 78 and 351 compared with the membrane filled with go only and plain one respectively this improvement was also noticed in the contact angle values where a more hydrophilic membrane was obtained by incorporating the additives uio 66 has a remarkable aperture size of 6 Ã¥ which allows water molecules to pass through but reject the dyes 42 moreover the composite gave the advantage of rejecting the mo and dr 80 dyes in addition to the enhancement in antifouling properties 3 1 2 heavy metals hms removal of hms is also a crucial research topic for many groups that is accomplished via applying different purification techniques mainly adsorption and membranes the preference to terminate hms because of their carcinogenicity and severe negative impacts on health 43 a paper from dr deng s group discussed the use of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fiber membranes embedded with uio 66 for arsenic removal 44 this membrane showed a mix of adsorption and filtration behaviors where filling the uio 66 particles increased the adsorption capacity of the membranes in addition other properties were improved such as hydrophilicity which enhanced the water flux and antifouling properties the adsorption behavior was studied separately in a batch mode to investigate the adsorption capability of uio 66 in which calculations of the binding energy were presented using the density functional theory dft at four connection levels from calculations all binding energies were negative indicating a spontaneous binding process at all levels however among these levels the highest values were for the oxygen of zr o c it was noticed that the full protonate arsenate was achieved at very low ph values then as the ph increased the arsenate species change to highly negative charge species where these species have stronger binding energy another point to mention is the positive charge of uio 66 at phs lower than 4 which offers interaction with the negative species of arsenic chromium ion was removed by utilizing pvdf membranes loaded with two mofs nps uio 66 nh2 and zif 8 and coated with chitosan nanofibers 45 in this work the synthesized membranes were a single layer pvdf with mofs and a two layers of chitosan pvdf with mofs where the nanofibers were made using the electrospinning technique by testing different loadings of mofs the highest outputs were by using chitosan pvdf 20 uio 66 nh2 mofs by which the water flux reached to 470 lmh and the cr vi removal was 95 6 uio 66 nh2 showed a better impact on the membrane s performance than zif 8 in terms of water flux and cr vi rejection filling uio 66 nh2 in loading ratios of 10 20 and 30 wt increased the diameter of pvdf fibers from 230 nm of the pristine membrane to 265 295 and 320 nm respectively this change led to an influence on the physicochemical properties of the membrane in another work uio 66 nh2 was incorporated with the polyethyleneimine pei and filled in the pvdf membrane that was used for cr removal 46 the pei coated the mofs particles to lower their agglomeration the uio 66 nh2 was positively charged which furtherly increased the membrane s positive charge this positive charge contributed to the rejection of cr iii and cr vi ions where cr vi was adsorbed within the pores of the membrane that contains the complex and cr iii was rejected due to charge similarity and the donnan effect 3 1 3 proteins mofs application in membrane based water treatment processes is increasing due to the high affinity of mofs to integrate within the polymeric matrix structure this unique advantage cannot be attained by conventional materials it is attributed to the polymeric linkers that work on stabilizing mofs particles inside the structure while the metallic part likely works on increasing the hydrophilicity polysulfone psu membrane is frequently applied for uf purposes due to its suitable pore size tortuosity and other transportation parameters one of the psu s weak points is its hydrophobicity where its improvement results in higher water flux here when poly sulfobetaine methacrylate psbma and uio 66 were introduced into the psu the hybrid membrane synthesized by phase inversion showed an improvement of 250 compared with the plain psu membrane another form of uio 66 uio 66 nh2 was also utilized as an additive but the uio 66 psbma membrane had incomparable water flux more than double 47 this improvement in water flux was associated with an intrinsic improvement in the antifouling properties another credit is the rejection water flux trade off overcoming which is not expected when conventional additives are used generally based on the unique structure of mofs uio 66 in particular the particles showed uniform distribution and high compatibility within the membrane which ended up with a matrix of low defects moreover the uio 66 psbma composite owned a super hydrophilicity that advanced the solvent and non solvent exchange which led to the formation of hydrophilic morphology and a highly porous membrane another advantage is the hydrophilic water paths that uio 66 supplies within the membrane which facilitate the transport of water molecules in addition to the sieving process that occurs inside the particles as discussed before the psbma was the key part of the modification process it was coated around the mof nps and on the psu membrane once the coated nps are embedded in the membrane an additional affinity for adherence is created because of the psbma that exists in both materials in another study the bovine serum albumin bsa was removed by a pvdf membrane incorporated with uio 66 nps 48 the blended membranes showed better performance in terms of protein rejection and water flux compared with the plain pvdf membrane here two methods of fabricating pvdf membranes were tested and a difference in the performance was recorded one is supramolecular and the other is direct filling we like to mention that the supramolecular membrane was synthesized by adding the uio 66 s raw materials to the polymeric casting solution where an interaction between the hydrogen bonds of uio 66 ligands and fluorine f atoms of pvdf occurred while in the direct filling the mof was prepared first and then filled into the casting solution however the film prepared via supramolecular method gave the highest performance compared to the plain and directly filled membranes this manufacturing method resulted in a highly stable mechanically robust and hydrophilic structure which ultimately enhanced the water flux and rejection to understand the improvement the plain pvdf membrane had a water flux and bsa rejection of 20 lmh and 80 respectively when uio 66 was filled in the membrane at different ratios the optimum ratio was 9 52 wt in both direct filling and supramolecular scenarios at that ratio the water flux and rejection of the direct filling increased to 120 lmh and 92 while they raised to 140 lmh and 98 for the supramolecular membrane respectively this huge increase in water flux was assigned to the enrichment in hydrophilic groups and the rise in membrane s specific surface area when uio 66 was introduced to the structure further addition of uio 66 nps increased the casting solution s viscosity that ultimately raised the steric hindrance and charge interaction what is next the intermolecular forces turned to the delayed separation phase instead of the instantaneous phase and the structure became dense loose and less porous on the other side the bsa rejection had the same behavior of improvement when the mof was incorporated because of the additional adsorption sites that the mof offered up to the optimum point and then decreased because excess raw materials hindered the growth of particles in general mofs have different types and preparation routes that could give different performance results here dehghankar et al 49 prepared two mofs uio 66 and mil 101 a chromium based mof and faujasite zeolite that were filled in the pvdf using the nonsolvent induced phase separation method the upgraded membranes were examined against the bsa where a membrane embedded with 0 1 wt mil 101 showed the best water flux results of 360 lmh 111 higher than the plain membrane and protein rejection of 100 the other outcomes of this membrane were the irreversible fouling and flux recovery ratio that were estimated to be 22 2 and 77 7 respectively the best results of uio 66 embedded membranes were obtained when 0 05 wt mof was filled where the water flux and bsa rejection were 320 lmh and 98 respectively the upper performance outcomes of mil 101 than uio 66 were attributed to its higher hydrophilicity surface area and pore size which was in acceptable agreement with the literature 50 although the performance of mil 101 was higher than uio 66 the used optimum amount of mil 101 was twice that of the uio 66 the reason could be the clustering of uio 66 at high loading ratios though further research is needed to clarify this observation these hydrophilic mofs increased the surface s morphology hydrophilicity and antifouling properties and decreased the surface roughness which also contributed in increasing the antifouling properties greywater is a type of wastewater that could be treated via uf hence matebese and moutloali tested the effect of using functionalized uio 66 nh2 go composite on the pes membrane 51 the uio 66 was modified with nh2 because this group works on facilitating the reaction of mofs with the go integrates the synergizing of both materials and decreases the chance of voids generation when an activated carbon ac pretreatment step was introduced the fouling and washing steps became less however the produced water was suitable for non potable purposes of irrigation toilet fire extinguishing and construction 3 2 nanofiltration nf nf is the process of separating contaminations that size between 8 and 50 Ã¥ from a feed this process falls between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis 1 different materials were employed to improve the performance of membranes and uio 66 is among them this mof was utilized in multiple nf applications to purify different feeds as described below 3 2 1 dyes removal the dyes molecular weight differs from one to another which puts them in a wide range of molecular mass and size methylene blue mb was removed by a cellulose membrane filled with uio 66 52 the membranes were prepared by dropping a solution of uio 66 in dmf on the regenerated cellulose membrane and applying a suction filtration setup the addition of uio 66 increased the hydrophilicity and provided selective pathways where an aperture size of 6 Ã¥ fitted with the application s requirements here the prepared membrane performance was superior compared to the commercial membrane furthermore a similar membrane was prepared via filling tio2 in the cellulose membrane and was compared with the mof membrane the tio2 membrane showed good flux but poor rejection which was attributed to the formation of interparticle voids that sized between 30 and 50 nm these wide voids are not able to retain the mb and the dye s molecules passed through another reason is that tio2 blocks the adsorption sites of the polymeric substrate which could also contribute to rejection deterioration the size of uio 66 was perfect for filling the average size was 50 nm while smaller particles of 10 nm size stocked within the pathways and offered selective filtration in addition to the high performance characteristics that uio 66 owns modifications could be made to further improve its specifications on the other hand partially reduced go prgo showed a remarkable performance in water treatment applications thereby zhang et al 53 intercalated the modified uio 66 with a carboxylic group cooh and the prgo to prepare a uio 66 cooh 2 prgo membrane which proved its superior efficiency compared with the pristine prgo membrane in low pressure nanofiltration process the novel composite gave a higher cavity for water molecules and a selective structure that reject the dyes efficiently regardless of the charge of the dye the water flux of the hybrid membrane was around triple times higher than the prgo membrane when equal amounts of the materials were used in membranes preparation it reached 20 0 2 5 lmh bar also dyes rejection was examined using positive methylene blue and negative congo red charged dyes where the rejections were 95 1 and 97 2 respectively these rejection values were also higher than the pristine prgo membrane which could be attributed to the additional surface charge the uio nh2 granted it is worth mentioning that the membranes were prepared by the simple assembly filtration method based on accumulating the particles on a filter that roles as a support for the generated filter the generated films were 300 nm thick and an ultrasonic pre step for the raw materials solutions was applied to grant a uniform distribution 3 2 2 heavy metals removal heavy metal removal has many purposes mainly to eliminate their harmful effects while precious heavy metals can be collected and reused the uio 66 cooh 2 prgo membrane described in the previous section 53 was employed to remove the divalent positive ions of cu and cd the rejection values of these ions decreased as their initial concentration increased however the uio 66 cooh 2 prgo membrane performance was better than the plain prgo one in terms of heavy metals removal and water flux when the concentration of cd 2 was 0 1 mm the prgo membrane s rejection was 57 0 which gradually decreased as the feed concentration increased when a 0 5 mm feed solution was used the rejection reached to 33 2 and the water flux was 4 6 2 1 lmh bar when the mof modified membrane was used to treat a 0 1 mm cd 2 feed solution the rejection raised to 92 6 this ratio decreased to 80 4 when a 0 5 mm feed solution was utilized all removal ratios of the mof modified membrane were higher and the water flux was 21 7 1 1 which is 4 72 times greater than the prgo membrane a similar observation was noticed when copper cu 2 was studied when a feed solution of 0 1 mm was used the removal ratios increased from 65 4 for the prgo membrane to 96 5 for the mof modified one when a 0 5 mm solution was used the copper ion rejection ratios were 44 5 for the prgo and 83 1 for uio 66 cooh 2 prgo however water fluxes were 5 2 1 7 lmh bar and 22 3 1 4 lmh bar for the prgo and uio 66 cooh 2 prgo membranes respectively which indicates an improvement of 4 3 times as mentioned above metal filtration could have purposes other than the removal of harmful metals some metals are valuable and need to be separated and reused in this regard aghili et al 54 prepared tfn membranes filled with nano gel uio 66 nh2 and supported with polyethyleneimine pei that were operated for separating the mono and multi violent ions when 1 wt of the gel was added the performance reached its maximum in terms of permeability and selectivity for two solutions of mg2 li and mg2 na the separation factor was 33 of mg2 li and the permeability reached up to 30 6 lmh bar this was attributed to the presence of the amine group in the mof that generated a vital layer with a positive charge which could aid the removal or separation of cations as the test was conducted for two days li ion recovery showed high stability 3 2 3 desalination there are different forms of desalination processes such as thermal electrical and membrane based in particular the membranes based processes take different forms depending on the properties of salt ions required to be separated nanofiltration commonly is an excellent process to remove the divalent but not the monovalent ions in contrast other types of processes fit the desire to remove the mono ions as will be described in a later section in this regard nanofiltration membranes filled with uio 66 nanoparticles or their derivatives have been investigated and compared with other membranes the preparation of 15 nm sized uio 66 nh2 nps and filling them within the thin polyamide layer were studied by gong et al 55 the reaction was conducted on a polydopamine wrapped single carbon nanotube cnt sheet this very thin support layer produced the thinnest tfn membrane where the total thickness of the whole composite was 20 3 during the membrane s preparation a pes microfiltration membrane was used to accumulate the components and was kept as a support sheet for the whole assembly a divalent na2so4 salt solution was utilized to examine the tfn membrane and rejection and water flux values of 97 1 and 46 lmh bar respectively were obtained the water flux of the mof modified membrane was 1 5 times higher than the plane membrane also the membrane showed high stability in terms of permeability and na2so4 rejection when tested for three days the outcomes of this research were higher than other similar works when compared in terms of na2so4 rejection and water flux in fact during this work five salts were tested and the salt rejection followed this order na2so4 97 1 mgso4 91 2 mgcl2 45 8 cacl2 40 8 and nacl 8 1 the rejection of divalent salts is higher than the monovalent which was imputed for two reasons the size sieving and the donnan effect by considering the exceptional outcomes that uio 66 offers its influence on nf membranes was compared to molybdenum disulfide mos2 nanosheets and gold au nanorods by gao et al 56 it was found that the loading density size and shape of the fillers have influential roles in their distribution within the synthesized membrane in the report the nps were forcedly dispersed within an aqueous solution of piperazine pip by ultrasonic which then yielded uniformly distributed additives in the membrane due to the micro wrinkled morphology this wrinkled surface increased the active area of contact and ultimately the hydrophilicity water flux and antifouling which maintained the divalent salt ions rejection high when the modified membranes were tested for 120 h the na2so4 rejection was always 97 which was attributed to the additional negative charge that membranes gained due to filling additives furthermore the tfn membranes embedded with mos2 uio 66 and au of 15 Î¼g cm2 filling density showed water flux of 18 0 16 8 and 16 0 lmh bar respectively these values have been improved compared with the pristine tfn membrane 9 6 lmh bar which was attributed to the improvement in hydrophilicity and reduction in cross linking it is notable to mention that when the test was conducted for 120 h the water flux of all membranes was slightly decreased nevertheless the uio 66 filled membrane was the highly stable one the last work to present is a comparison of performance between different types of mofs that were synthesized using different ionic liquids ils namely choline dioctyl sulfosuccinate cho aot r limonene rl and ethylene glycol eg ethanol ammonium formate eoaf the three ils ruled as an emulsifier nonpolar phase and polar organic solvent respectively these microemulsions ils were employed as nanoreactors to prepare suitable nanosized mil 53 al zif 8 hkust 1 and uio 66 nh2 57 the nf membrane was prepared by reacting the pip with tmc and supported with a pan sheet the uio 66 nh2 showed the lowest surface area 259 70 m2 g while it was 513 15 m2 g for the mil 53 al 738 4 m2 g for the hkust 1 and 1079 43 m2 g for the zif 8 although the uio 66 nh2 membrane showed the lowest contact angle and surface roughness of 32 1 0 5 and 9 6 0 5 sa respectively the important specifications are the performance ones salt rejection and water flux where the filled membranes were tested with three feed solutions 1000 ppm mgso4 2000 ppm na2so4 and 2000 ppm nacl using a driving pressure of 150 psi table 1 below illustrates the water flux and salt rejection of the membranes where the uio 66 membrane shows the best results hence the importance of using the uio 66 and its derivatives appears clear in this comparison there are general scenarios associated with the nf process that explain the rejection behavior of the commonly used salts however it can be stated that ions naturally pass the membrane through their counterions due to charge balancing laws these scenarios are 1 for na2so4 the highly utilized salt for nf membranes testing is the na2so4 in which the so4 2 ion owns a higher electrical charge and diameter than na thereby the sulfate ion dominates the transfer phenomenon where membranes could be prepared with a high negative charge to obtain high rejection by repulsing this ion by the donnan and dielectric effects in addition to the molecular sieving 58 2 for mgso4 the dielectric repulsion of nf membranes against the mgso4 ions is high since its cat and an ions have considerable charges furthermore both mg and so4 ions are relatively large so sieving also affects the ions transport moreover since the charges of both ions are close to each other the negative membrane could re pull anions in the same magnitude of attracting cations as a result the electrostatic effect is equivalent at the surface of the membrane here the mg2 ion rejection is lower than na ion due to the higher electrostatic attraction between the magnesium ion and membrane s surface than sodium 59 3 for cacl2 and mgcl2 these salts have divalent cations that equalized with two monovalent anions where of course the cation s stokes radius is greatly bigger as the nf is applied the process is dominated by cation retention hence the filtration process depends on sieving the cations that are attracted by the membrane and retaining the chlorine ions due to the dielectric impact improving the nf membranes by filling different additives particularly uio 66 in this work within the membrane s textile increases the membrane pore size and decreases the cross linking consequently the salt rejection decreases 4 for nacl it is usually considered in the nf process to study the ability of the membrane in removing the monovalent ions which is commonly very low compared with the other divalent salts filling nps in the membrane could not improve the rejection to an acceptable level instead it could decrease the rejection due to the loss in crosslinking and the generation of additional transport channels that nps provide when added 56 3 3 forward osmosis forward osmosis fo is an osmotically driven membrane process that uses osmotic pressure as an operating force to treat water that contains undesired dissolved ions fo process has been examined in various applications such as water desalination 60 wastewater reclamation oilfield produced water treatment and food industry 61 most of the state of the art fo research focuses on preparing a suitable membrane for the process typically fo thin film composite tfc membranes consist of two layers a supporting layer that gives the membrane its mechanical integrity and an active layer that gives the membrane its selectivity 62 the polyamide selective layer is typically prepared via the interfacial polymerization reaction between m phyenelendiamene mpd and trimsoyl chloride tmc 63 incorporating nanoparticles in either the support or active layer has been a subject of much recent research where the fo process was utilized in several applications as illustrated below 3 3 1 antibiotics wastewaters from hospitals and pharmaceutical factories deliver significant amounts of antibiotics to the environment these harmful substances can cause negative effects on human health and aquatic life fo has the potential to treat antibiotics from wastewater that was proved in several studies some of these studies focused on incorporating uio 66 nps within the tfc tfn membranes and their performance in antibiotics treatment for instance uio 66 was embedded in different ratios 0 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 wt in a psu support layer that was made by the electrospinning technique 64 the electrospun substrate nanofibers were prepared by dissolving 26 psu in dmf while the polyamide layer was formed by the ip reaction the prepared tfn membranes were tested to remove six antibiotics sulfamethoxazole smz sulfamethazine sm2 trimethoprim tmp erythromycin em chloramphenicol cl and tetracycline tc when the 0 5 wt uio 66 membrane was used to treat the antibiotic wastewater the water flux reached to 50 78 lmh an increase of 46 compared with the plain membrane and the rejection rates for all antibiotics maintained 99 9 fig 3 shows the sem and tem images of uio 66 filled psu support layers another way to utilize the uio 66 in fo is by filling it into the thin active layer here guo et al investigated the performance of the tfc fo membrane incorporated with uio 66 nh2 to reject tetracycline tc and tetracycline resistance genes trgs 65 the support layer was prepared via the electrospinning process of polyurethane psu at different ratios 0 100 10 90 20 80 or 30 70 where the 20 80 support sheet showed the best performance results showed that a tc rejection of 99 64 was estimated when 0 075 wt of the nps were filled in another work guo et al studied the effect of cu2 concentration on the removal of tc and trgs using tfc fo membranes embedded with uio 66 nh2 that were prepared in their study mentioned above 66 results revealed that the rejections of tc and cu2 were 99 53 and 97 99 respectively however the rejection of trgs was about 90 at a cu2 concentration of 500 Î¼g l when 0 5 m nh4 2hpo4 was used as a draw solution the high rejection is attributed to the complexation reaction between cu2 and tc the adsorption of cu2 on the membrane surface and the electrostatic interaction 3 3 2 heavy metals heavy metals are considered one of the major hazardous materials that are discharged into the environment due to various industrial activities 43 67 these materials should be minimized down to a certain level before discharging into the environment fo membranes have the ability to reject hms ions in different ratios depending on the targeted element s properties uio 66 nps were added to the fo membranes to enhance their performance in hms removal the removal of arsenic ions from a 100 ppm feed water via fo membranes embedded with uio 66 nps was studied 68 where the mof was filled within the psu support layer with a ratio of 0 5 the membranes showed arsenic rejection and water flux of 87 5 and 5 8 lmh respectively another incorporation method is by filling uio 66 in the thin film here eghbalazar and shakeri investigated this membrane to treat 2000 ppm cu 2 aqueous solution 69 the uio 66 nps were coated with polydopamine to enhance their dispersion in the mpd aqueous solution this approach resulted in improving the physicochemical properties surface chemical composition hydrophilicity morphology and roughness of the tfc fo membranes in terms of fo performance the synthesized membrane showed a water flux of 22 2 lmh and cu rejection of 97 9 in another study the removal of chromium cr 3 was investigated using tfc membranes embedded with uio 66 nh2 70 the aminated uio 66 nps were incorporated in the mpd solution before reacting with the tmc to make the thin polyamide layer the tfc membrane filled with 800 ppm of uio 66 nh2 nanofiller showed the best results in terms of higher hydrophilicity and cr 3 rejection the stability and the agglomeration of mof nps in the polyamide layer are issues that really affect hms rejection however it was found that modifying the uio 66 nps can overcome the abovementioned issues he et al prepared sulfonated graphene oxide sgo which is a two dimensional structure nanomaterial with a large number of carboxyl sulfonic acid and epoxy groups and used it to modify the uio 66 nps 71 the modification of uio 66 nps involved the coordinating effect between oxygen containing functional groups and metal ions to uniformly distribute zirconium ions on the sgo layer the adhesion between the nanomaterial and membrane was improved due to the hydrogen bonding and chemical interactions between sgo uio 66 and mpd the prepared membrane was tested in heavy metals i e cu and pb removal of a 2000 ppm feed solution within 2 h operation 99 4 removal rate was acquired and after 10 h it maintained 97 5 indicating the stability of the sgo uio 66 tfc fo membrane 3 3 3 desalination the fo process has been widely used in desalination as an effective and economical method compared to the other traditional desalination methods such as reverse osmosis the utilization of fo for this purpose was investigated by many groups including ours where many approaches were followed to improve the membrane s performance 72 filling uio 66 nps in the pa membrane for desalination via fo was investigated they can be added either in the mpd aqueous solution or in the tmc organic solution the uio 66 f 4 made by using the linker f4 bdc nps were synthesized and incorporated into the mpd solution with loading ratios from 0 05 to 0 5 wt 73 increasing the filling ratio to 0 5 wt within the tfn membrane lowered the contact angle from 93 9 of the plain membrane to 71 7 the highest water flux in the pro pressure retarded osmosis mode i e support layer facing the feed solution was 54 7 lmh that was obtained by loading 0 1 wt of the mof at this condition the reverse salt flux was 15 7 gmh in another study uio 66 nps were embedded in the tmc organic solution of concentrations 0 05 to 0 2 wt 74 the prepared tfn membranes possessed super hydrophilic surfaces with contact angles lower than 30 the best fo membrane was obtained with a loading ratio of 0 1 wt where it showed a water flux of 51 lmh and 27 lmh in the pro and fo modes respectively however a moderate reverse salt flux was observed for the optimum membrane of 12 3 gmh in the pro mode and 6 1 gmh in the fo mode similarly wang and coworkers used a different approach to incorporate uio 66 nps into the polyamide layer after dispersing them in hexane at different concentrations i e 0 0025 0 005 0 025 and 0 05 wt 75 this step was conducted after covering the polysulfone support layer with mpd and before pouring the tmc solution which led to prepare a uio 66 decorated interlayer even at a much low mof uio 66 loading percentage the decorated interlayer revealed significantly improved water flux two times higher and reduced the structural parameter decrease by about 50 compared with the conventionally uio 66 embedded tfn membrane uio 66 nps can be modified to improve their properties before incorporating them within the fo membranes as an example graphene quantum dots gqds were used to modify the uio 66 nh2 nps 76 the gqds uio 66 nh2 nps have been added to the mpd solution at concentrations of 100 200 250 and 500 ppm the obtained tfn membranes exhibited superior properties in terms of hydrophilicity morphology and roughness the highest water flux was acquired for the membrane filled with 250 ppm gqds uio 66 nh2 to be 59 lmh and 85 lmh in the fo and pro modes respectively also the selectivity of this membrane was 1 5 times higher than the control tfc membrane another option is to incorporate the uio 66 in the support layer this option can change the thermodynamic properties and the kinetic conditions e g the morphology chemistry structure and wettability of the polymeric solution thus altering the phase inversion pathway 77 the results showed that the interfacial polymerization reaction was improved due to the addition of uio 66 nps in the substrate where the best loading ratio was 6 5 wt moreover it was concluded that adding uio 66 to the support layer resulted a significant reduction in the internal concentration effect similarly arjmandi and colleagues studied the effect of adding uio 66 nps to the polyether sulfone support layer to control the negative impact of the internal concentration polarization 78 3 4 reverse osmosis reverse osmosis is a pressure driven membrane process where hydraulic pressure is applied to overcome the osmotic pressure of a saline feed and force the freshwater to pass through the ro membrane typically ro is the most popular process for desalination due to its economical operation compared with other thermal electrical processes 79 similar to the fo process the dominant membrane in this technique is the tfc membrane zhao et al used a spraying nozzle to incorporate uio 66 nh2 nps into the polysulfone support layer before performing the ip reaction between mpd and tmc 80 the uio 66 nh2 was dispersed in ethanol at a percent of 0 02 wt while the time of spraying varied from 1 to 10 min to control the amount of spraying solution the prepared membranes were tested to desalinate brackish and sea water via using nacl feed solution of 2000 ppm and 32 000 ppm concentration respectively as the spraying duration increased the surface coverage of the uio 66 nh2 nps increased after 5 min clusters of the nps were observed as seen in fig 4 ro performance tests showed that the tfn membrane with a spraying time of 3 min exhibited the best water flux and salt rejection results also the tfn membranes showed better chlorine resistance compared to the pristine tfc membranes in a previous study in our group ro membranes embedded with uio 66 and mil 125 a titanium based mof were prepared and compared at a similar particle size of 100 nm 81 results revealed that uio 66 and mil 125 could enhance the membrane s performance and the impacts mainly depended on the mofs loading both mof nanoparticles i e uio 66 and mil 125 showed comparable performance in the desalination of brackish water with a salt rejection of 98 5 it is good to mention that the optimum filling ratio of uio 66 was 0 15 and of mil 125 was 0 3 however mil 125 filled membranes showed higher performance another approach to synthesizing membranes is by preparing a mof membrane yet as the ro process uses a high hydraulic pressure and the strength of the polycrystalline mof membranes is not high enough this membrane was not widely applied however a seed assisted solvothermal synthesis method on a porous alumina ceramic tube was used to prepare a dense continuous uio 66 membrane 82 the manufactured membranes were tested for various salts desalination i e kcl nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 for 180 h continuously the results showed that high rejection of divalent ions 82 for ca and 98 for mg was achieved while lower rejection values were observed for the monovalent ions 45 8 for k and 49 8 for na these findings confirm that the prepared uio 66 membranes with this method have a nanofiltration nature although adding nanomaterials to the tfc membranes leads to better permeability they may have a negative effect on the selectivity this is attributed to the agglomeration of nanomaterials and low compatibility between the nanomaterials and polyamide matrix in order to overcome these issues tannic acid was used as shown in fig 5 to modify the uio 66 nh2 nanoparticles before incorporating them into the polyamide layer 83 the resulting tfn membranes with tannic acid exhibited a significant increase in water permeability compared to both conventional tfc and plain uio 66 nh2 incorporated tfn membranes also due to the bridging effects of tannic acid the upgraded membranes showed higher salt rejections than plain uio 66 nh2 membranes in brackish and seawater desalination finally liu et al studied the performance of the tfn uio 66 nh2 membranes in boron removal from seawater 84 the optimum uio 66 nh2 concentration was found to be 0 05 which showed a 50 increase in water flux and a significant boron rejection compared to the conventional tfc membranes 4 future prospective according to the recent progress and applications of uio 66 it is anticipated to have further utilization in terms of membrane based water treatment techniques the following points could be observed in the near future 1 it is known that many mofs have been manufactured and their number is increasing however modifying the mof itself gives new properties and functions in the uio 66 case there are many upgraded forms as mentioned throughout the above sections uio 66 nh2 could be the most popular form in water treatment applications due to its remarkable merits integrating uio 66 with new groups could propose a structure with new advantageous functions 2 new uio 66 composites could be synthesized by incorporating the mof with other materials here we like to mention two examples of this type of composite first is the use of multilayered ti3c2tx mxene with uio 66 cooh 2 to fabricate a ti3c2tx uio 66 cooh 2 membrane that was employed in polluted oil water emulsion separation 85 the other example is the integration of uio 66 with graphene oxide where xiao et al modified the uio 66 nh2 with perylene 3 4 9 10 tetracarboxylic dianhydride and filled it with the go to prepare a novel membrane used for dye wastewater treatment 86 in another work uio 66 nh2 go was filled in the polyethersulfone membrane and used to cure the greywater 51 in all previous cases the synergized uio 66 showed superior results compared with the plain structure 3 designing the appropriate form of uio 66 for the desired application is another area of investigation in membranes there are many physicochemical properties that affect the overall performance for instance reverse osmosis and membrane distillation md are desalination methods however the ro requires a hydrophilic membrane while the md requires a hydrophobic membrane here if uio 66 is utilized in the md the hydrophilicity should be engineered to suit the application we like to mention that a hydrophobic uio 66 was already produced by using naphthyl ligands 87 4 the uio 66 membrane could be one of the next generation membranes used for water treatment processes where this membrane is consisted of a uio 66 layer and supported by another material however some processes such as reverse osmosis need to apply high pressure but this type of membrane cannot hold it finding methods to consolidate the uio 66 layer and tolerate the applied pressure could leap desalination due to the unique pore size of uio 66 that could sieve water from saline 5 conclusion by surveying the previous literature it can be concluded that uio 66 has been successfully utilized in membrane based water treatment processes that are applied to treat water from a wide range of contaminations in general the uio 66 and its derivatives were incorporated within the membranes to improve their performance and properties the membrane s performance is usually expressed by the water flux and contaminants rejection where uio 66 mainly enhanced the water flux in uf nf fo and ro applications due to its remarkable hydrophilicity the rejection was also increased due to the sieving pore size of uio 66 that could selectively filter water molecules from pollutants even salts ions other properties influence other parameters for instance uio 66 usually increases the membrane s hydrophilicity that ultimately enhances the antifouling property uio 66 s functional group s could contribute to engineering the membrane to fulfill the desired application in the future we anticipate a continuous progress in utilizing uio 66 for membrane based water treatment processes also there is still a wide area of research to investigate new scopes of uio 66 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no known conflict in this work acknowledgment the authors like to thank

the langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics model reported to best describe the isotherm and kinetic model respectively solute concentration is the most important physiochemical parameter in the adsorption process and continuous column mnz is easy to operate the adsorption is fast and the experiment can easily be scaled for large scale implementation future studies should include competitors for more realistic adsorption studies and to demonstrate the affinity of the adsorbent for mnz graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption isotherm and kinetic water and wastewater remediation molecular modelling and simulation metronidazole antibiotic data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water pollution is one of the important issues brought about by overpopulation and increased industrialization 1 antibiotics in the environment are now a cause for concern because they increase on daily basis 2 3 antibiotics including metronidazole mnz are among the pharmaceutical pollutants considered important because of their wide use fig 1 4 mnz was used against the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis which causes trichomoniasis a sexually transmitted disease std 5 mnz is effective against helicobacter pylori which causes peptic ulcer disease associated with stomach cancer 6 7 mnz is available in various forms which include oral vaginal intravenous rectal but oral dosages are the most common 9 the liver is the organ responsible for metabolizing mnz by hydroxylation acetylation and or conjugation with glucuronides 5 10 despite its wide use mnz has many mild and moderate side effects including nausea and abdominal pain diarrhoea neurotoxicity optic neuropathy peripheral neuropathy and encephalopathy in rare cases 11 13 mnz is resistant to biological breakdown subsequently accumulating in the environment with negative effects it might be a possible human carcinogen and mutagen due to lymphocytic injury and has a toxicological effect on living organisms 14 15 furthermore the traces of these antibiotics present in soil or in the aquatic environment often lead to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains posing threat to organisms and human health the adverse effects of mnz are a cause of concern and must therefore be controlled and eliminated thus it is important to investigate ways to eliminate emerging pollutants from water to prevent the negative ecotoxic effects 16 17 mnz is not easy to remove with usual approaches because of its low degeneration and high dissolve in water 15 16 18 it is not possible to rely on biodegradation to decrease the concentration of mnz in the environment because it is difficult to biodegrade and its absorption is very slow 18 20 there are several treatments available for the removal of mnz and include nano photolysis 21 oxidation reduction biodegradation and ozonation 20 22 23 heterogeneous fenton reaction 17 and photocatalyst 24 low degradability mnz is non biodegradable and high solubility in water logp 0 02 are two characteristics of mnz which makes it difficult and sometimes impossible to remove it from aqueous media through conventional methods 25 conventional processes such as oxidation tends to create intermediate products that are even more toxic than the original compound 26 thus bypassing the difficulty of degrading mnz and focusing on removal and reclamation via adsorption is preferable this makes adsorption the most popular and effective approach because it is cheap efficient simple and renewable 27 28 these adsorbents can be categorized into several groups such as carbon based adsorbents clay minerals metal organic frameworks mofs molecularly imprinted polymers and others the ph of the solution has the greatest effect on the adsorption of mnz the adsorption capacity of mnz is governed by their surface area and the size distribution of the pores their chemical nature 29 31 this current study that has its base in the literature redeemed from google scholar publisher medline and an array of recent works discusses the ecotoxicology of mnz mechanism of adsorption of mnz from pharmaceutical wastewater this paper will be the first to provide a comprehensive review on the available treatment technologies for remediating mnz contaminated solution moreover the occurrence of mnz in the environment will be discussed in this review paper in addition the health threats and ecotoxicity of mnz are included in this article furthermore the possible pathways for mnz to enter the environment will be covered as well in this review paper previous work did not consider the dynamical evolution of the mnz adsorption therefore investigations using molecular dynamics for real time monitoring of the adsorption processes are recommended 2 ecotoxicological effects of mnz in the environment mnz is applied as an antibacterial and anthelmintic agent to protect health and safeguard the well being of humans and domestic animals 11 32 33 for example mnz is widely used against infections activated by anaerobic bacteria and protozoans 34 and is often amalgamated with chemotherapeutic agents to lessen the fear of perioperative infection post surgery 35 the use of large doses of mnz in medicine and as growth promoters in animals and humans may cause mnz to enter the soil through animal manure used as fertilizers in farming or by spill and disposal such as discharge of treated or untreated sewage hospital water 18 36 fig 2 mnz binds physically and chemically with soil sediments persists for long periods and becomes bioavailable which causes detrimental consequences on organisms 36 although the undesirable biological effects are minor on humans of concern is the genotoxic effects on human cell lines carcinogenic effects in animal models and mutagenic effects in bacteria 37 for example an in vivo study on an overdose of mnz in a zebra fish model shows disruption of the endocrine system that can initiate proopiomelanocortin a pomca expression in the pituitary system of the larvae in a stage and dose dependent manner furthermore upregulation of prolactin prl and glycoprotein hormone subunit a gsua were also noticed during mnz treatment 34 similar studies on rat models exhibited disruption of endocrine functionalities like spermatogenesis and reproduction related hormones such as follicular stimulating hormones fsh and luteinizing hormone lh regulation 37 40 the presence of mnz in soil and dung can cause ecotoxicological effects on soil fauna for example a study showed a 10 reduction in reproduction rate of springtails and enchytraeidsat mnz concentrations of 61 111 mg kg and 83 722 mg kg respectively 32 researches on the chronic toxicity of mnz in aquatic regions on human exposure to low doses via swimming or consumption of aquatic products such as fish are still vague however the synergistic effect of pharmaceuticals to have a biological consequence cannot be ruled out studies showed that exposure of pharmaceuticals on fish disturb their growth innate immunity and reproduction 41 42 and also adversely affects marine phytoplankton 43 for example mnz at concentrations of 0 1 0 5 and 2 5 mg l administered to common carp cyprinus carpio l resulted in a decline in oral and cellular parameters that involved total white blood cells wbc count complement activity lysozyme activity total serum protein levels bactericidal activity 42 liver damage and oxidative stress measured by elevated levels of malondialdehyde glutathione and ethoxyresorufin o deethylase 42 the discharge of effluents in seawater especially from pharmaceutical industries and hospital wastewater has caused the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistant strains 44 47 likewise in the freshwater habitat acute toxicity has been observed on freshwater algae at a low mg l range 48 furthermore studies have also accounted for cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on erythrocytes of nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus following a 72 h exposure to mnz at 5 mg l 49 antibiotic resistance has been reported in marine bacteria fish marine mammals and sea birds 50 51 for example bacterial isolates such as pseudomonas aeruginosa actinomyces turicensis acinetobacter junni nocardia sp and micrococcus sp 52 all these studies emphasize that overdosing of mnz in clinical practices and biomedical research has a substantial ecotoxicological impact on most life forms 3 characterization and mechanisms of adsorbents 3 1 characterization the characterization of adsorbents is important in identifying the attributes design morphology content functions along with capacity uptakes 52 usually several important features are considered in the absorption process fig 3 such as scanning electron miscopy sem fourier transform infrared spectrometry ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray diffraction xrd and n2 bet the physical properties and morphology of the adsorbent surface can be determined by sem 41 ftir identifies the interplay within the functional groups of adsorbate and adsorbent 4 xps determent the elementary composition of the adsorbent 53 in this context using xrd the amorphous and crystalline characteristics of the adsorbent can be decided using the n2 bet equation the porosity of the adsorbent can be set on while removing the contaminant 1 in order to understand and identify the phenomenon of retention adsorbent adsorbent the properties of the adsorbent are very important and in the interpretation of kinetic and isotherms results 23 therefore many mathematical models have been applied 20 3 2 adsorption mechanisms of mnz adsorption happens when surface particles of the adsorbent are not in the same environment as the bulk particles in general the adsorption mechanism is influenced by parameters that include soluble chemistry ph pka phpzc the mnz adsorption mechanism will be better known when data from isotherm modelling kinetic modelling thermodynamic modelling and spectroscopic analyses are considered 54 in the mnz adsorption process several mechanisms occur which can only be discussed with the help of systematic approaches using thermodynamic studies Î´g the characteristic of the interactivities physical or chemical can be realised bigger Î´g implies chemical interactions while lower values hint physical adsorption 55 the process can be explained in several ways a reabsorption mechanisms the validity of strong acids and bases illustrate that it is a chemical adsorption mechanism and the strength of detergents such as distilled water or organic solvents demonstrate a physical mechanism 56 one of the basic assumptions of the models is the use of kinetic modelling and isotherms that use the best fit spectroscopic study can dispense information about specific factor groups and places of interactions thus separating chemical bonds will be possible 55 soluble chemistry ph pka phpzc regulates what chemical interactions can take place under precise conditions 57 in the case of mnz antibiotics the carbonyl group at pka 12 58 and amine group at pka2 14 44 is protonated and can exist as cations anions and zwitterions 58 59 at ph 5 9 the mnz antibiotic is electrostatically neutral and present as zwitterions which has low solubility and is effectively adsorbed 60 61 electrostatic interaction improves mnz adsorption only when it has an opposite adsorbent charge 62 electrostatic interplay become stronger when the ph of the solution is between 1 and 5 59 the Ï Ï interactions can be elucidated with the benzene ring in the mnz structure which has many electrons and causes the accumulation effect 63 other effective characteristics in the adsorption process include the specific surface area pore size and baroelectricity of the adsorbent surface the size of the pores on the surface of the adsorbents are divided into small pores with a diameter of 20 nm medium pores with a diameter of 20 to 500 nm and large pores with a diameter of 500 nm the size of the pores is usually inversely related to the specific surface area available for adsorption with small pores creating a higher specific surface area in the adsorbent 62 the small pores on the adsorbent surface are often effective in absorbing contaminants with small molecular sizes 64 the electric charge on the adsorbent surface is another important factor in the absorption of different pollutants by different adsorbents in adsorption systems phpzc is commonly used to evaluate the effect of this factor the phpzc represents the ph point of absorption system where positive and negative electric charges are in equilibrium so that if the ph of the medium is lower than phpzc the adsorbent surface will have a positive electric charge and if the ph is higher than phpzc the adsorbent surface will have a negative electric charge 61 63 in general although some interactions transpire the prime process that narrate mnz adsorption are electrostatic Ï Ï hydrophobic interactions h bonds and pore diffusion 64 fig 4 shows possible mechanisms for adsorption of antibiotics over adsorbents 65 4 adsorbents types for removal of mnz from water environments 4 1 carbon based compounds carbon based materials are used as effective adsorbents to remove water and wastewater contaminants in this and following sections the numerous systems and functions of activated carbon carbon nanotubes and graphene as promising adsorbents for the removal of mnz are investigated table 1 the application of carbon based materials is briefly mentioned 4 1 1 activated carbon activated carbon ac is common physical adsorbents the adsorbent is used to remove organic pollutants macromolecules colourants as well as taste and odour producing molecules ac is very porous and usually has a porosity of 1 5 g cm3 the ability of activated carbon to absorb organic matter is related to its surface and textural properties the use of activated carbon is limited due to its high cost 66 the raw materials used to produce activated carbon include wood coconut shell lignin hazelnuts walnuts coal and polymeric raw materials including rubber and plastic waste 67 mnz is often adsorbed using carbon based compounds 54 because it has a large surface area and pore volume that favour adsorption 17 talha et al showed the highest qmax of mnz as 303 mg g by zr iv metal organic frameworks 16 mnz adsorption has been achieved using ac from siris seeds 68 due to a koh microwave activation process it possesses a large specific surface area 1824 8 m2 g 68 the mnz absorption was endothermic and spontaneous with Ï Ï interactions hydrogen bonding and pore filling serving as the primary mechanisms graphene 28 69 commercial activated carbon 70 multi walled carbon nanotubes 71 ac from prosopis juliflora 72 carbon xerogel 70 and biochar from vallisneria natans 73 are some of the carbon based materials investigated for mnz adsorption ac is very effective due to its special surface and high adsorption capacity and surface pores in removal of organic pollutants adsorption by activated carbon is affected by sorbent qualities material properties and wastewater contamination thus all aspects influencing adsorption should be considered for absorption of any contaminants granular ac has a high adsorption capacity and is suitable for the adsorption of antibiotics with increasing retention time the qmax enhances absorption 74 the increase in adsorption could be associated to a growth in the frequency of meetings between pollutants and adsorbent and the high speed of the absorbent 75 researchers have applied ac to absorb antibiotics under flowing conditions however the prime issue with the usage of ac powder nano sized adsorbents or isolated nanoparticles thus the secondary pollution concern is the distribution and manufacture of this system most of these issues can be solved by using the adsorbent s magnetism 76 difficult regeneration is a marked disadvantage of ac as new ac would have to be produced from sludge and separated from the pollutants which can be difficult clogging and the long contact time required between water and the ac are also key issues however with ac there is minimal risk of producing new toxic compounds 77 4 1 2 carbon nanotubes in a carbon nanotube the carbon atoms are defined in a barrel shaped structure it is a hollow tube whose walls are made of carbon atoms the arrangement of carbon atoms in the wall of the cylindrical structure is exactly the same as the arrangement of carbon in graphite plates the carbon plates are stacked on top of each other and each layer is connected to the substrate through weak bonds and endolysis 81 the properties of these materials depend on the atomic order diameter and length of the tube and its morphology and structure carbon nanotubes have unique mechanical electrical optical and thermal properties and have a very high adsorption capacity for a variety of pollutants including heavy metals dye molecules and organic matter 82 chemical resistance high thermal stability and catalytic properties are other features of these materials 83 84 in terms of biological properties in a simple classification the biological interactions of nanotubes can be examined from both intracellular and extracellular dimensions depending on the diameter length and presence of the walls carbon nanotubes are divided into two categories fig 5a b 4 1 2 1 single wall carbon nanotubes swcn the swcn can be thought of as a graphite layer called a graphene layer in an integrated cylinder wrapped graphene sheets 85 theoretical calculations and experimental results on single wall carbon nanotubes show that they have very good mechanical thermal photochemical and electrical properties but are currently expensive 86 87 4 1 2 2 multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcn the mwcn can be thought of as a set of concentrated wall nanotubes consisting of several layers of graphite that rotate inward the length and diameter of these structures are very different from nano concrete wall samples and their characteristics are very different the layer spacing in mwcn is adjacent to the distance between the graphene layers in graphite and they have similar morphological properties and characteristics as single wall nanotubes 88 kariim et al recorded a qmax of mnz as 0 209 mg g 71 4 1 2 3 mechanisms of pollutant removal by carbon nanotubes the first factor to consider is the extent to which different contaminant molecules have access to the adsorption sites located in the structure of the materials fig 5c 89 it should be noted that the adsorption on the external grooves and sites on the surfaces is balanced much faster than the internal surfaces intranet channels and inside the tube in fact the outer surfaces are directly exposed to the contaminating molecules while the adsorption process on the inner surfaces starts from the end of the pore and then spreads to the inner sites 90 91 the second factor influencing the rate of adsorption is whether the two ends of the cap are open or closed because the openness of two or one end of the adsorbent allows contaminant molecules to reach the required points thus increasing the adsorption capacity 92 the third factor is the purity of the carbon nanotubes among the impurities in nanotubes are soot amorphous carbon and carbon particles surrounded by metal particles all of which reduce adsorption the capacity 83 the fourth factor is the type of oxygenated functional groups present on the surface of nanotubes generally the functional groups of these materials are oh oc and cooh and according to studies the formation of these functional groups improves the adsorption performance of contaminants on the other hand functional groups may upsurge diffusion resistance and reduce the surface area of the nanotubes reducing the levels available for organic compounds carbon nanomaterials are also widely used especially for various water contaminants such as detergents insecticides herbicides fats oils grease phenols volatile organic compounds antibiotics dyes ammonia salts as well as bacteria viruses fungi and algae 93 94 current research has shown that cnts are able to enter the body and may cause many adverse biological effects and even more so when pollutants are present 95 cnts have a high adsorption capacity for some bulky organic molecules like antibiotics because of their large pores in bundles and accessible sorption sites 96 4 1 3 graphene graphene oxide graphene is an attractive option for removing pollutants from aqueous systems due to its unique properties such as perfect carbon nanostructure with sp2 hybridization large specific surface area and strong interactions with other atoms and molecules 97 100 graphene is hydrophobic which benefits water purification graphene naturally removes water from it and when narrow pores are created water passes through it quickly this property has given rise to the idea of using graphene to filter and desalinate water especially now that technology has been developed to create such tiny pores 99 100 chemical structure and crystal structure of graphene compound are illustrated in fig 6a b 101 the graphene family includes reduced graphene oxide rgo graphene oxide go go and rgo with enhanced adsorptive characteristics can be produced by chemical oxidation of graphite and reduction of graphene oxide respectively fig 6c 101 graphene sheets on which very small pores are made are used as a means of purifying water as they allow water molecules to pass through and block the passage of contaminants and other particles light weight and small size of graphene are two factors that help to make water filters and salt separators scientists have discovered that thin membranes of graphene oxide in addition to being hydrophobic are impermeable to gases and vapours 97 98 further research has shown that a highly precise graphene lattice can separate atoms of impurities in water that are different but the same size at extremely high speeds in this way the purification process is done in the best possible way graphene or graphene oxides have a variety of environmental applications graphene oxide has been extensively studied because of its ability to remove contaminants such as antibiotics and heavy metals 97 100 theoretically graphene has several advantages such as high permeability when used as a membrane antibiotic adsorption on go is a physical process the advantage of this being that the carbon structure stays intact and unchanged 102 however it is difficult to ensure uniform fabrication control of pore sizes and graphene has poor mechanical stability 101 103 4 2 metal organic framework mofs mofs are a new generation of hybrid porous compounds that have been developed to utilize the capabilities of porous organic and inorganic materials the inorganic part of mofs can include simple metal cations such as zinc iron copper or rare metals such as scandium or metals such as aluminium gallium tin or hybrids of metals with oxygen fluoride chloride or hydroxide various organic linkers can be used this diversity of organic and inorganic components in suitable for physical and chemical synthesis conditions means there is room for manipulation and the ability to create a target structure 103 104 the most common methods for synthesizing mofs include solvo thermal and hydrothermal processes the reaction time for each of these processes varies from a few hours to a few days 105 attempts to make new mofs involve selecting the desired ligand as well as the appropriate metal salt and solvent selecting the molar ratios of the reactants and activating the conditions for the reaction to occur at specific times and temperatures by selecting the appropriate ligand with functional groups specific properties of the mof can be achieved even changes in the organic component of synthesized organic metal frames and changes in species of functional groups such as br nh2 ch3 can achieve a new composition with different properties a range of organic ligands are commercially available which can be modified and manipulated in vitro presently increasing attention to adsorption has led to the development of porous materials including ac mesoporous silicate materials porous organic polymers and mofs especially in the specific surface area porosity size and simple and easy synthesis compared to zeolites have attracted attention from researchers the Ï Ï interaction hydrophobicity hydrophilicity has led experts to consider the use of mofs in contaminant removal processes especially emerging contaminants as well as to study the predominant interaction of mof structure and properties 106 109 table 2 shows a review on mofs application for removal of mnz the large porosity and chemical tunability makes mofs beneficial for adsorption while their catalytic nature is beneficial for degradation of certain pollutants 110 while most mofs are of insufficient water stability severely impeding their applications in water several water stable mofs have been demonstrated in recent years mofs are generally in the form of crystalline powders which could cause secondary contamination in the treated water and this also makes them hard to recover and regenerate 111 4 3 nanoscale semiconductor photocatalysts nano sized compounds have particular physical chemical and biological characteristics that make them useful to chemical activity and allow them to interact with other materials hydrothermal and sol gel loading methods are examples of nanoparticle loading methods 75 76 nanoparticles with their small size exhibit mechanical magnetic optical electrical and chemical properties correction factors for contaminated aquatic environments include metals with zero capacity such as iron tin aluminium and zinc 114 optical nano photocatalyst processes are based on the formation of highly active species of hydroxyl radicals that are able to decompose a wide range of contaminants quickly 115 light activated nanoparticles such as high energy cleavage semiconductors which include titanium dioxide tio2 magnesium oxide nanoparticles mgo nps and zinc oxide zno are used because of their ability to remove and refine contaminants 116 tio2 nanoparticles are inexpensive non toxic have a strong oxidation capacity environmentally friendly and have a high surface to volume ratio under uv irradiation tio2 nanoparticles have the highest removal efficiency compared to other methods in recent years the use of heterogeneous photocatalysts especially tio2 to reduce organic pollutants and effluents have been studied extensively 114 117 118 the main mechanisms of the reactions are given in eqs 1 8 114 118 and fig 7 21 119 1 tio 2 hv h vb e cb 2 h vb h 2 o o h h 3 h vb oh o h 4 organics h vb products 5 e cb o 2 o 2 6 o 2 e cb o 2 2 7

recommended for use in heterogeneous photocatalysis process 120 121 the steps of the photocatalytic process for pollutant removal are shown in fig 8 122 recently zno nanoparticles have been used as sensors and as photocatalysts to purify pollutants researchers in this field are interested in manipulating the surface of nanoparticles with organic and inorganic dyes in order to increase the optical response from uv to visible light of these particles this makes nanoparticles of metal oxides more effective as photocatalysts for the conversion of environmental pollutants because the amplitude of uv light is only about 5 of the spectrum of sunlight nanoparticles have been selected as the most ideal nano photocatalysts due to their electron cavity pairs which have a high reducing power and oxidation to reduce oxygen and oxidize water to superoxide and hydroxyl radicals 114 the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants by zinc oxide as explained by the following equations 122 123 9 zno hÏ zno e cb h vb 10 zno h vb h 2 o zno h oh 11 zno h vb oh zno oh 12 zno e cb o 2 zno o 2 13 o 2 h ho 2 14 ho 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 15 zno e cb h 2 o 2 oh oh 16 h 2 o 2

nanophotocatalysts have enhanced activity over larger photocatalysts due to having a greater surface area and shape dependent features and properties 124 4 4 zero valent iron nanoparticles zero valent iron nanoparticles have a zero valent iron core with a cover of iron oxide hydroxide the thickness of which increases with the expansion of iron oxidation 125 due to the high reactivity of elemental iron oxidation of the nucleus is imminent when zero valent iron nanoparticles are exposed to air or water during environmental operations eqs 20 and 21 zero iron nanoparticles are oxidized corroded to produce ferrous iron 126 20 fe 0 2h 2 o fe 2 h 2 2h 2 o 21 fe 0 o 2 2h 2 o 2fe 2 4oh subsequent reactions of fe2 will result in the production of fe3o4 magnetite fe oh 2 hydroxyl phosphorus and fe oh

choice for the treatment of toxic and hazardous pollutants and the improvement of contaminated sites these properties have led to their increasing use in the treatment of environmental pollutants the mechanism of pollutant removal by iron nanoparticles is to reduce the pollutants to less hazardous products and then absorb them research shows that nanoparticles can be used as reducers and catalysts act to detoxify a large number of environmental pollutants zero capacity metals are effective factors in removing pollutants among these metals zero iron is preferred due to its abundance cheapness non toxicity rapid reactivity and high efficiency in the decomposition of contaminants such as antibiotics drug residues solvents pesticides and heavy metals 128 129 fang et al showed that mnz was completely removed by zero capacity iron nanoparticles the mnz solution at 80 mg l was rapidly removed by zero capacity iron nanoparticles within 5 min at initial solution ph 5 60 and zero capacity iron nanoparticle dose of 0 1 g l 130 wang found that 94 18 of mnz was removed using zero capacity iron nanoparticles css 131 emulsified zero valent iron nanoparticles can cause an increase in mobility of the contaminants and as always the potential ecological or human risk derived from the used of nanoparticles has to be considered 132 4 5 magnesium oxide nanoparticles mgo nps typically nanoparticles are suitable for chemical reactions and adsorption of various organic compounds due to their high specific surface area 133 the nanoparticles are easily accessible cheap non toxic stable reusable and have high adsorption capacity reactivity as well as unique mechanical electronic and optical properties 134 individual and energy band gap is a major feature of magnesium oxide nanoparticles in addition magnesium oxide is able to oxidize organic compounds to harmless compounds such as co2 and h2o band and formation of holes mgo surf h hole and free electrons mgo surf e on the surface of mgo occur mgo surf h with high oxidation ability leads to direct oxidation of organic pollutants some studies of mgo nanoparticles as catalysts have been used to remove organic pollutants in photocatalytic processes which increase the efficiency of removing organic pollutants from an aqueous medium 30 135 sun et al showed that the synthesized mg oh 2 nanoparticles in removal mnz in the catalytic ozonation process antibiotic concentration 10 500 mg l dosage of 1 0 g l time 15 min 134 kalhori et al showed optimum conditions with coating with mgo nanoparticles mgo leca as antibiotic concentration of 40 mg l adsorbent dosage of 1 0 g l ph 7 contact time of 150 min and bet 76 12 with a removal of 97 for mnz 136 4 6 nanocomposites nanocomposites consist of two phases the first phase is a crystalline design that in reality is the base of the nanocomposite and may be made of polymer metal or ceramic the second phase is nanometre scale particles that are distributed as reinforcements or fillers for specific purposes in the first phase and include power support electrical conductivity and magnetic properties 137 138 the most attention is paid to polymer based nanocomposites polymer nanocomposites have high durability low weight high thermal cohesion high electrical conductivity and high chemical resistance reinforcement of polymers using organic and mineral materials is common 139 nanocomposites play crucial role in the treatment of wastewater and tap water 140 nasseh et al synthesized a novel feni3 sio2 cus magnetic nano adsorbent and examined its ability to remove mnz from aqueous solutions at ph 7 contact time of 180 min nanocomposite dose of 0 1 g l at 20 c mnz adsorption was observed the absorption percentage increased significantly as the nano absorbent dosage increased from 24 18 to 62 18 after five adsorption desorption cycles the effectiveness of the magnetic nano adsorbent reduced marginally 54 malakootian et al a novel magnetic biocomposite adsorbent cofe2o4 activated carbon chitosan cf ac ch was synthesized and applied for metronidazole mnz adsorption show that optimal adsorption capacity q e of 36 897 mg g was obtained under optimal conditions as follows adsorbent dose 450 mg l ph 5 02 mnz initial concentration 22 35 mg l and contact time 46 25 min 53 balarak et al created polyaniline nanocomposites and found a significant potential for mnz removal with increasing solution temperature from 10 to 55 c the sorption capacity of the polyaniline humic acid pa ah composite increased when the temperature increased from 10 to 55 c the q max increased from 42 2 to 49 95 mg g 141 the efficiency and usability of nanocomposites are significantly improved in terms of nanoparticle dispersion stability and recyclability compared to free nanomaterials composites or polymers are highly tunable in terms of their porous structures mechanical properties and functional groups 142 4 7 chitin and chitosan based adsorbents a polymer is a substance made up of high mass molecules containing duplicate structural units or monomers joined together by covalent chemical bonds polymers are including two categories natural and synthetic polymers natural polymers are polymers that are generally found in living organisms and plants in the form of cellulose polysaccharides and proteins chitin is a natural polymer which is a dominant component of the cell wall in fungi chitin and its derivative chitosan have many applications in various fields 143 144 the most common source of chitin is crustaceans such as shrimp and crabs chitin is white hard inelastic cellulose with a nitrogen containing polysaccharide and a major source of surface contamination in coastal areas fig 9 146 chitosan has a higher percentage of nitrogen than cellulose this property makes chitin a useful chelating agent chitin and chitosan are good functionalizing agents because of their natural properties biocompatible biodegradable non toxic and adsorption properties 143 145 chitin is insoluble in water and many organic solvents due to its lipophilic properties and chitosan is soluble in dilute acid solutions at ph 6 chitosan has been introduced as a good adsorbent and coagulant due to the presence of amine nh2 and carboxyl oh groups in water and wastewater these sites are used as reaction sites for the purification process chitosan has other properties such as cationic polymer non toxic biodegradable good adsorption ability and antibacterial properties 145 chitosan can be modified by various methods to remove the desired contaminant from water chemically modified chitosan has been used for various environmental applications the modifications increase the elimination properties of metals and increase the stability of the polymer in acidic conditions these chitosan modifications increase the potential for the removal of contaminants 147 148 asgari et al used fe3o4 chitosan for 100 removal of mnz antibiotic concentration of 10 mg l adsorbent dosage of 2 g l ph 3 contact time 90 min 149 arghavan used feni3 chitosan bioi nanocomposite for 100 removal of mnz antibiotic concentration of 20 mg l adsorbent dosage of 0 04 g l ph 3 and contact time 200 min 150 chitosan polymers can be developed to have better capacities to adsorb wastewater pollutants and resist degradation in acidic environments also the cationic charge of chitosan is able to neutralise anionic particles it is abundant and biodegradable however potentially hazardous materials are required to regenerate chitosan 151 152 5 isotherm and kinetic models and thermodynamic studies 5 1 isotherm and kinetic models various recognised adsorption equilibrium isotherms shown in table 3 are investigated to identify mnz adsorption on to new generation adsorbents 138 relative uptake and excretion rates can be balanced by langmuir isotherms 53 the freundlich isotherm is describe adsorption processes at heterogeneous surfaces 4 the four kinetic models including conventional non linear and linear forms in table 4 are evaluated to understand the mechanics in adsorption process taking place in a batch process the best models are langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics table 5 summarizes the equilibrium isotherm and motion modelling for mnz uptake 5 2 thermodynamic studies of mnz temperature influences the adsorption process thus thermodynamic studies the thermodynamic parameters are standard gibbs free energy g enthalpy change h and entropy change s the enthalpy of adsorption is another significant feature of adsorption during adsorption the surface s residual forces decrease resulting in a drop in surface energy which manifests as heat as a result adsorption is always an exothermic process in other words adsorption enthalpy h is always negative when a gas is adsorbed the molecules freedom of movement is restricted this translates to a decrease in the adsorbate molecules entropy following adsorption i e s is negative adsorption results in a drop in the system s enthalpy as well as its entropy 28 the thermodynamic condition for a process to be spontaneous is that g must be negative under constant temperature and pressure i e there is a decrease in gibbs energy g can be negative if h has a sufficiently large negative value as ts is positive based on the eq g h ts as a result in a spontaneous adsorption process the combination of these two elements causes g to be negative as the adsorption process a progress h becomes less and less negative until it equals ts and g is zero at this point equilibrium has been achieved 163 as depicted in table 5 the adsorption process being exothermic because Î´h value is negative in study by balarak et al showed that mnz removal by go increase with increase in the temperature from 25 to 45 c 28 5 3 dynamic adsorption of mnz in a fixed bed column experiment experimental adsorption studies include batch treatment and column treatment studies in batch adsorption experiments a reactor tank is used to hold the adsorbent and adsorbate parameters such as ph temperature adsorbate concentration can be manipulated easily the advantages of this is that it is cost effective and the process is simple however it is not at all practical to use in large scale practical applications due to space constraints and the amount of adsorbate needed batch adsorption is thus perfect for preliminary small scale testing of an adsorbent adsorbate system 166 column adsorption studies known as fixed bed or packed bed consist of a column containing adsorbent the solution of adsorbate is passed through the column at an experiment specific flow rate various parameters can be adjusted similar to those in batch experiments the advantage of this technique as it allows for much higher adsorption than batch experiments using the same amount of adsorbent 167 the aim of fixed bed column mnz experiments is to understand the dynamic behaviour of an adsorbent when treating continuous flows of mnz contaminated water 163 this aids the design optimization building and monitoring a scaled up treatment system for field applications limited articles focus on adsorption of mnz in a fixed bed column shown in table 6 Ã§alÄ±Åkan and gÃ¶ktÃ¼rk tested the adsorption of sulfamethoxazole and mnz by ac in both batch and column mnz modes 168 in the fixed bed column experiments the effect of flow rate on adsorption capacity was determined and 200 mg l of both antibiotics were removed the authors found that the breakthrough curves for mnz were the same when the flow rate changed from 0 8 to 1 8 l h however when the flow rate increased the capacity of the fixed bed column as well as the breakthrough time decreased dÃ­az blancas et al studied the mechanisms responsible for the mass transfer during adsorption of mnz from water in a fixed bed column packed with granular activated carbon gac f400 169 the authors employed a fixed bed general model fbgm to simulate the breakthrough curves under various experimental conditions such as flow rate initial mnz concentration and bed height the outcomes showed that the fbgm perfectly simulated the experimental data under all operational conditions additionally surface diffusion was the most important mechanism during the dynamic adsorption of mnz and accounted for 80 100 of the total intraparticle transport manjunath and kumar prepared a glass column filled with activated carbon that was produced from prosopis juliflora pjac to investigate the simultaneous removal of mnz and other compounds i e phosphate po4 3 and nitrate no3 72 during the dynamic experiments the effect of flow rate mnz initial concentration and bed height on the performance of the glass column was elaborated the resulting breakthrough curves were anticipated using bed depth service time bdst adams bohart yoon nelson and thomas the modelling illustrated that the thomas model was the best in predicting the experimental data and the qmax of mnz by pjac was 9 70 mg g 6 desorption and reusability of mnz reclaiming of adsorbents for multiple cycles is important in water and wastewater treatment operations as it not only reduces the total expense of the treatment process but decreases the volume of the generated sludge 170 adsorbents can be successfully reused after creating a desorption protocol to effectively regenerate and prepare the exhausted adsorbents for new adsorption cycles 72 table 7 summarizes research on the desorption reclamation and recycling of adsorbents for efficient and effective removal of mnz from aqueous solutions carrales alvarado et al found that within 7 days both neutral ph 7 and acidic ph 2 solutions were able to fully desorb the mnz molecules from the surface of ac f400 and activated carbon cloth acf 29 manjunath et al utilized distilled water as an eluent to desorb the mnz molecules from the surface of powder ac and concrete containing graphene 72 the authors found that the distilled water could barely desorb 3 5 and 1 7 of mnz from powder ac and concrete containing graphene respectively after soaking in distilled water for almost a day it is important to mention that carrales alvarado et al and manjunath et al did not examine the possibility of recycling adsorbents for additional cycles 29 72 jafarzadeh et al synthesized go functionalized Î² cyclodextrin ag nanocomposite go Î² cd ag to adsorb low concentrations of mnz 0 25 mg l from water 171 the authors used go Î² cd ag washed with acetone and deionized water to desorb mnz from the surface following this regeneration protocol go Î² cd ag was successfully reused for three consecutive adsorption cycles where the removal efficiency declined from 89 3 to 75 28 furthermore nasseh et al regenerated exhausted magnetic nanocomposite feni3 sio2 cus after an adsorption process by washing out the adsorbed molecules of mnz from the surface of feni3 sio2 cus repeatedly using 0 5 m hcl and deionized water 54 the authors dried the feni3 sio2 cus in an oven at 80 c before proceeding to the next adsorption cycle they reported that the removal efficiency of feni3 sio2 cus deteriorated from 66 43 to 53 97 after five consecutive adsorption cycles because of the reduction in nanocomposite mass after each cycle alivand et al produced a nonporous carbon material from iranian asphaltene and functionalized it with amine groups ianc nh2 to efficiently remove both amoxicillin and mnz from water 172 in their experiment the authors used 3 m sodium hydroxide solution to desorb the two antibiotics from the surface of ianc nh2 and recycled for four adsorption processes following the first regeneration cycle the adsorption capacity of ianc nh2 for mnz decreased from 472 1 to 449 1 mg g due to the partial blockage of the amine functional group however ianc nh2 showed a stable performance in the following adsorption cycles till the end of the fourth cycle kahkha et al co precipitated fe3o4 on the surface of mwcn to produce mwcn fe3o4 mwcnts for mnz adsorption from water 173 the authors demonstrated that submersing fe3o4 mwcnts for 30 min in 2 ml methanol solution with 1 of naoh was enough to transfer the adsorbed mnz molecules back to the desorbing solution furthermore they reported that fe3o4 mwcnts was reused for 15 cycles and at the end of 15th cycle the adsorption capacity decreased from 163 to 87 mg g asgari et al magnetized chitosan powder by co precipitating fe3o4 cts mnzps to eliminate mnz 149 the authors employed two solutions for mnz desorption namely 5 hcl and 0 1 m naoh after the adsorption of mnz by cts mtzps the exhausted cts mtzps was magnetically collected and dried for 4 h at 45 c the desorption experiments revealed that the acidic medium 5 hcl favoured the desorption of mnz with 85 4 desorption on the other hand the alkaline solution desorbed only 40 of the mnz after five successive adsorption desorption cycles cts mtzps exhibited an outstanding performance in remediating mnz contaminated solutions with removal efficiencies 90 ahmadfazeli et al functionalized activated carbon by amine group to target mnz adsorption from water 8 in their research 0 1 m naoh was used to regenerate the activated carbon after the adsorption of mnz for five additional treatment cycles the regeneration results explained that the removal efficiency of mnz diminished from 95 48 to 73 41 at the end of the fifth adsorption cycle bonyadi et al thermally converted wheat straw to graphite oxide go and then modified it to produce amine modified green graphene amgg 56 the amgg demonstrated a remarkable mnz adsorption capacity 416 7 mg g moreover applying an acidic desorbing solution ph 4 for amgg promoted the adsorption of mnz with 77 removal efficiency in contrast 71 of mnz was removed by amgg after regeneration with an alkaline solution ph 10 thus the acidic medium was used to regenerate amgg for five adsorption cycles the reusability of amgg for five cycles decreased the removal of mnz from water as the adsorption percentage deteriorated from 84 to approximately 57 at the end of the last adsorption process 163 talha et al tested eight metal organic frameworks for the adsorption of mnz from water and concluded that uio 66 nh2 achieved the highest mnz adsorption capability 265 5 mg g 16 in addition uio 66 nh2was recycled for three adsorption cycles by simply washing the spent uio 66 nh2with deionized water acetone and absolute methanol to ensure the full desorption of mnz molecules before starting another cycle the significant loss in the mass of uio 66 nh2 after each recycling process reduced the adsorption capacity of mnz from 265 5 mg g to approximately 175 mg g after the third adsorption cycle usually the performance of adsorbents decreases after several adsorption cycles however zheng et al 163 reported an interesting finding about the performance of two types of conjugated microporous polymers cmps namely cmp a and cmp b after regenerating them using methanol and ultrasonication 169 they declared that the adsorption capacity of mnz by both polymers was significantly enhanced after the regeneration process this improvement could be attributed to the ultrasonication and washing process making the polymers more dispersed in the solution and ready to react with the mnz molecules 7 molecular modelling and simulation adsorption studies using molecular modelling and simulation have received much less attention than experimental studies nevertheless recent experimental studies on adsorption include theoretical molecular modelling it is worth mentioning that the theoretical modelling of adsorption does not yet account for all aspects of the process this is usually due to two reasons namely the modelling of adsorbent surface is not always possible except in a very few cases 157 and complete theoretical modelling requires expensive calculations that are not always tractable 174 therefore molecular modelling of adsorption is performed on only a few selected cases for which the adsorbent surfaces can be modelled in addition the computational methods are limited to affordable methods in this regard computational studies of mnz adsorption have been performed by a few authors using affordable computational approaches although a few studies have been reported using grand canonical monte carlo and artificial neural networks most of the theoretical investigations have been performed using density functional theory dft the majority of the studies used polyaniline polypyrrole and tio2 as adsorbents for the computational modelling fig 10 is an example of molecular adsorption of mnz using a mesoporous aluminium metal organic framework as adsorbent aarab and coworkers 72 174 175 performed theoretical molecular modelling of the adsorption of mnz using polyaniline and polypyrrole adsorbents the authors used dft and calculated the adsorption energy to evaluate adsorption strength one study modelled the adsorption of mnz onto polypyrrole at the b3lyp 6 31g d level of theory 157 the calculations were accomplished in the solvent phase using the solvation model conductor like polarizable continuum model cpcm the adsorption energy between mnz and polypyrrole was 428 kj mol this highlights that the adsorption process is instinctive and includes physisorption 157 in another study the authors performed both theoretical and experimental research to assess the performance of polyaniline polypyrrole for the removal of mnz 174 the theoretical study included dft at the b3lyp 6 31g d level of theory the authors evaluated the adsorption energy Î´h 37 3 kj mol and the result showed that the adsorption of mnz by polyaniline polypyrrole was spontaneous the molecular electrostatic potential showed that the adsorption mechanism took place through hydrogen bonding between the oxygen atoms of mnz and the nh and ch groups of the polyaniline polypyrrole adsorbent 174 furthermore adsorption of mnz and sodium salicylate molecules onto polyaniline was reported by aarab and coworkers 175 the investigation used dft at the b3lyp 6 31g d level of theory the adsorption energy was calculated as 572 4 and 249 4 kj mol for mnz and sodium salicylate respectively 175 these values indicated that the adsorption of mnz and sodium salicylate by polyaniline was a spontaneous process the authors concluded that the adsorption process of mnz and sodium salicylate by polyaniline was physisorption 175 in addition to polyaniline and polypyrrole tio2 has been used for the computational modelling of mnz adsorption tio2 polymer composites were used for the removal of mnz in a perdew burke emzerhof pbe functional of dft 176 the authors calculated the adsorption energies and evaluated the adsorption in gas phase and in water different composites were tested for the adsorption of mnz of which polyvinyl alcohol chitosan blend supported tio2was the best adsorbent for mnz 176 wang et al performed a theoretical study on the adsorption of mnz onto tio2 surfaces the adsorption was performed using the 101 and 001 surfaces of tio2 at the pbe dnp level of theory dispersion corrections were considered and the calculations carried out in both gas and solvent phase different adsorption sites were tested for 101 surface the maximum adsorption energy was 1 69 ev and 3 11 ev in the gas and water phase respectively for the surface 001 1 58 ev and 3 12 ev were reported as the maximum adsorption energy in the gas and water phase respectively 131 the adsorption of mnz onto the tio2 101 and 001 surfaces was investigated by qin et al 177 using pbe functional of dft including a d3 dispersion correction the calculations were performed in the gas phase and three different solvents and different adsorption sites were examined the adsorption energy was between 0 95 and 3 11 ev for the tio2 101 surface and between 0 84 and 3 29 ev for the tio2 001 surface 177 bismuth oxychloride biocl and manganese doped bismuth oxychloride mtz biocl have been used for the adsorption of mnz molecule in pbe dft modelling the surface 001 was used for the adsorption after saturation with hydrogen atoms 178 in addition adsorption of mnz onto boron nitride hydrogenated graphene and boron carbide surfaces was assessed using dft 179 for each surface different adsorption sites were considered the qmax energy was 44 50 kj mol with a boron carbide surface while the minimum adsorption energy was found with hydrogenated graphene surface 179 for all the complexes the adsorption enthalpy was negative highlighting the spontaneous adsorption process it is worth noting that the investigation was performed both in gas and solvent phase the authors found that a boron carbide surface realised the maximum adsorption energy in both gas phase and water 179 more dft studies of the adsorption of mnz are reported in the literature min et al investigated theoretical and experimental biodegradation of pharmaceutical pollutants including mnz the theoretical investigations were performed using dft at the b3lyp 6 31 g d p level of theory the authors calculated quantum chemical descriptors of the pollutants the electrophilicity of the compounds was the key factor in determining the biodegradation process 180 alivand et al carried out experimental and theoretical investigations of the adsorption of mnz and amoxicillin on waste derived nanoporous carbon they used dft pbe dnp including dispersion corrections to account for the van der waals interactions the waste borrowed nanoporous carbon was modelled using functionalized pristine molecule with pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen atoms the adsorption energy was 95 02 and 65 51 kj mol for amoxicillin and mnz respectively which indicated that the adsorption was more favourable for amoxicillin than mnz 172 adsorption of mnz using artificial neural networks and grand canonical monte carlo simulations has been reported extractions of pharmaceutical pollutants including mnz were investigated using artificial neural networks which predicted a removal efficiency of 97 64 for mnz 181 talha and coworkers investigated the adsorption of mnz using zirconium iv metal organic frameworks zr mofs both experimentally and theoretically the theoretical study used the grand canonical monte carlo simulation and the pbe functional of dft 16 and it is worth noting that advanced oxidation processes were used for the extraction of mnz in addition to adsorption xu et al reported the fragmentation mechanisms of mnz using advanced oxidation processes different degradation pathways were proposed along with the resulting fragments all calculations were performed using dft at the m06 2x 6 311 g d p level of theory 182 computational and theoretical molecular modelling of the adsorption of mnz has received less attention compared to experimental studies the investigations were performed mainly using dft although two studies used artificial neural networks and grand canonical monte carlo simulations some authors investigated solvent effects on the adsorption energy using implicit solvation models as most of the real adsorption processes take place in water or other solvents a proper modelling of the mnz adsorption should take solvent effects into account currently either the solvent effects have not been considered or are considered using implicit solvation models implicit solvation models are known to be inefficient for short range solvation thus for accurate modelling of the solvent effects one should consider explicit solvation models or a combined explicit and implicit solvation model the latter is perfectly modelled using the so called qm mm approach quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics in addition previous work did not consider the dynamical evolution of the mnz adsorption therefore investigations using molecular dynamics for real time monitoring of the adsorption processes are recommended 8 knowledge gaps future perspectives mnz is in competition with other molecules for adsorption materials often dimetridazole dtz is preferentially adsorbed above mnz especially by activated carbons because of its higher electron density and smaller molecule size 29 other competitors include lead 70 phosphate and nitrate 72 future studies should include these competitors for more realistic adsorption studies and to demonstrate the affinity of the adsorbent for mnz various computational modelling techniques have been used to simulate the adsorption of mnz from aqueous solution dÃ­az blancas et al used a diffusion model to determine the adsorption rate of mnz on granular activated carbon at different concentrations the authors found that surface volume diffusion was more relevant than pore volume diffusion 169 the same conclusion was made by flores cano et al 80 density functional theory calculations were used by aarab et al 157 who found that the adsorption process using polypyrrole was governed by physical interactions it is worth doing more computational modelling to determine which physical and chemical characteristics are desirable in an adsorbent many studies focused on the use of batch adsorption whereas continuous column mnz adsorption might be better suited solute concentration is the most important physiochemical parameter in the adsorption process and continuous column mnz is easy to operate the adsorption is fast and the experiment can easily be scaled for large scale implementation these properties make column mnz adsorption advantageous over batch adsorption which often requires long idle times few studies explored continuous column mnz adsorption further dÃ­az blancas et al 173 did a continuous column mnz adsorption study with activated carbon which yielded promising results it is worthwhile to investigate other column mnz packing materials 169 desorption and reusability require further investigation when adsorption is by physical interaction as is the case with the majority of adsorbents then elution and desorption is relatively simple and should not require dangerous eluents like strong acids for practical reasons the adsorbent used should be relatively reusable otherwise the adsorption process would become costly and create masses of new pollutants which need to be disposed of in a way that will not further pollute soil and groundwater future studies should include these competitors for more realistic adsorption studies and to demonstrate the affinity of the adsorbent for mnz 9 conclusion this paper showed a review a suite of recent works discusses the ecotoxicology of mnz mechanism of adsorption of mnz from pharmaceutical wastewater adsorbent types and their adsorption capacities empirical findings on the kinetics and thermodynamics also it discussed molecular modelling and simulation of mnz removal from pharmaceutical wastewater previous work did not consider the dynamical evolution of the mnz adsorption the

wastewater remediation molecular modelling and simulation metronidazole antibiotic data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water pollution is one of the important issues brought about by overpopulation and increased industrialization 1 antibiotics in the environment are now a cause for concern because they increase on daily basis 2 3 antibiotics including metronidazole mnz are among the pharmaceutical pollutants considered important because of their wide use fig 1 4 mnz was used against the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis which causes trichomoniasis a sexually transmitted disease std 5 mnz is effective against helicobacter pylori which causes peptic ulcer disease associated with stomach cancer 6 7 mnz is available in various forms which include oral vaginal intravenous rectal but oral dosages are the most common 9 the liver is the organ responsible for metabolizing mnz by hydroxylation acetylation and or conjugation with glucuronides 5 10 despite its wide use mnz has many mild and moderate side effects including nausea and abdominal pain diarrhoea neurotoxicity optic neuropathy peripheral neuropathy and encephalopathy in rare cases 11 13 mnz is resistant to biological breakdown subsequently accumulating in the environment with negative effects it might be a possible human carcinogen and mutagen due to lymphocytic injury and has a toxicological effect on living organisms 14 15 furthermore the traces of these antibiotics present in soil or in the aquatic environment often lead to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains posing threat to organisms and human health the adverse effects of mnz are a cause of concern and must therefore be controlled and eliminated thus it is important to investigate ways to eliminate emerging pollutants from water to prevent the negative ecotoxic effects 16 17 mnz is not easy to remove with usual approaches because of its low degeneration and high dissolve in water 15 16 18 it is not possible to rely on biodegradation to decrease the concentration of mnz in the environment because it is difficult to biodegrade and its absorption is very slow 18 20 there are several treatments available for the removal of mnz and include nano photolysis 21 oxidation reduction biodegradation and ozonation 20 22 23 heterogeneous fenton reaction 17 and photocatalyst 24 low degradability mnz is non biodegradable and high solubility in water logp 0 02 are two characteristics of mnz which makes it difficult and sometimes impossible to remove it from aqueous media through conventional methods 25 conventional processes such as oxidation tends to create intermediate products that are even more toxic than the original compound 26 thus bypassing the difficulty of degrading mnz and focusing on removal and reclamation via adsorption is preferable this makes adsorption the most popular and effective approach because it is cheap efficient simple and renewable 27 28 these adsorbents can be categorized into several groups such as carbon based adsorbents clay minerals metal organic frameworks mofs molecularly imprinted polymers and others the ph of the solution has the greatest effect on the adsorption of mnz the adsorption capacity of mnz is governed by their surface area and the size distribution of the pores their chemical nature 29 31 this current study that has its base in the literature redeemed from google scholar publisher medline and an array of recent works discusses the ecotoxicology of mnz mechanism of adsorption of mnz from pharmaceutical wastewater this paper will be the first to provide a comprehensive review on the available treatment technologies for remediating mnz contaminated solution moreover the occurrence of mnz in the environment will be discussed in this review paper in addition the health threats and ecotoxicity of mnz are included in this article furthermore the possible pathways for mnz to enter the environment will be covered as well in this review paper previous work did not consider the dynamical evolution of the mnz adsorption therefore investigations using molecular dynamics for real time monitoring of the adsorption processes are recommended 2 ecotoxicological effects of mnz in the environment mnz is applied as an antibacterial and anthelmintic agent to protect health and safeguard the well being of humans and domestic animals 11 32 33 for example mnz is widely used against infections activated by anaerobic bacteria and protozoans 34 and is often amalgamated with chemotherapeutic agents to lessen the fear of perioperative infection post surgery 35 the use of large doses of mnz in medicine and as growth promoters in animals and humans may cause mnz to enter the soil through animal manure used as fertilizers in farming or by spill and disposal such as discharge of treated or untreated sewage hospital water 18 36 fig 2 mnz binds physically and chemically with soil sediments persists for long periods and becomes bioavailable which causes detrimental consequences on organisms 36 although the undesirable biological effects are minor on humans of concern is the genotoxic effects on human cell lines carcinogenic effects in animal models and mutagenic effects in bacteria 37 for example an in vivo study on an overdose of mnz in a zebra fish model shows disruption of the endocrine system that can initiate proopiomelanocortin a pomca expression in the pituitary system of the larvae in a stage and dose dependent manner furthermore upregulation of prolactin prl and glycoprotein hormone subunit a gsua were also noticed during mnz treatment 34 similar studies on rat models exhibited disruption of endocrine functionalities like spermatogenesis and reproduction related hormones such as follicular stimulating hormones fsh and luteinizing hormone lh regulation 37 40 the presence of mnz in soil and dung can cause ecotoxicological effects on soil fauna for example a study showed a 10 reduction in reproduction rate of springtails and enchytraeidsat mnz concentrations of 61 111 mg kg and 83 722 mg kg respectively 32 researches on the chronic toxicity of mnz in aquatic regions on human exposure to low doses via swimming or consumption of aquatic products such as fish are still vague however the synergistic effect of pharmaceuticals to have a biological consequence cannot be ruled out studies showed that exposure of pharmaceuticals on fish disturb their growth innate immunity and reproduction 41 42 and also adversely affects marine phytoplankton 43 for example mnz at concentrations of 0 1 0 5 and 2 5 mg l administered to common carp cyprinus carpio l resulted in a decline in oral and cellular parameters that involved total white blood cells wbc count complement activity lysozyme activity total serum protein levels bactericidal activity 42 liver damage and oxidative stress measured by elevated levels of malondialdehyde glutathione and ethoxyresorufin o deethylase 42 the discharge of effluents in seawater especially from pharmaceutical industries and hospital wastewater has caused the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistant strains 44 47 likewise in the freshwater habitat acute toxicity has been observed on freshwater algae at a low mg l range 48 furthermore studies have also accounted for cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on erythrocytes of nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus following a 72 h exposure to mnz at 5 mg l 49 antibiotic resistance has been reported in marine bacteria fish marine mammals and sea birds 50 51 for example bacterial isolates such as pseudomonas aeruginosa actinomyces turicensis acinetobacter junni nocardia sp and micrococcus sp 52 all these studies emphasize that overdosing of mnz in clinical practices and biomedical research has a substantial ecotoxicological impact on most life forms 3 characterization and mechanisms of adsorbents 3 1 characterization the characterization of adsorbents is important in identifying the attributes design morphology content functions along with capacity uptakes 52 usually several important features are considered in the absorption process fig 3 such as scanning electron miscopy sem fourier transform infrared spectrometry ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray diffraction xrd and n2 bet the physical properties and morphology of the adsorbent surface can be determined by sem 41 ftir identifies the interplay within the functional groups of adsorbate and adsorbent 4 xps determent the elementary composition of the adsorbent 53 in this context using xrd the amorphous and crystalline characteristics of the adsorbent can be decided using the n2 bet equation the porosity of the adsorbent can be set on while removing the contaminant 1 in order to understand and identify the phenomenon of retention adsorbent adsorbent the properties of the adsorbent are very important and in the interpretation of kinetic and isotherms results 23 therefore many mathematical models have been applied 20 3 2 adsorption mechanisms of mnz adsorption happens when surface particles of the adsorbent are not in the same environment as the bulk particles in general the adsorption mechanism is influenced by parameters that include soluble chemistry ph pka phpzc the mnz adsorption mechanism will be better known when data from isotherm modelling kinetic modelling thermodynamic modelling and spectroscopic analyses are considered 54 in the mnz adsorption process several mechanisms occur which can only be discussed with the help of systematic approaches using thermodynamic studies Î´g the characteristic of the interactivities physical or chemical can be realised bigger Î´g implies chemical interactions while lower values hint physical adsorption 55 the process can be explained in several ways a reabsorption mechanisms the validity of strong acids and bases illustrate that it is a chemical adsorption mechanism and the strength of detergents such as distilled water or organic solvents demonstrate a physical mechanism 56 one of the basic assumptions of the models is the use of kinetic modelling and isotherms that use the best fit spectroscopic study can dispense information about specific factor groups and places of interactions thus separating chemical bonds will be possible 55 soluble chemistry ph pka phpzc regulates what chemical interactions can take place under precise conditions 57 in the case of mnz antibiotics the carbonyl group at pka 12 58 and amine group at pka2 14 44 is protonated and can exist as cations anions and zwitterions 58 59 at ph 5 9 the mnz antibiotic is electrostatically neutral and present as zwitterions which has low solubility and is effectively adsorbed 60 61 electrostatic interaction improves mnz adsorption only when it has an opposite adsorbent charge 62 electrostatic interplay become stronger when the ph of the solution is between 1 and 5 59 the Ï Ï interactions can be elucidated with the benzene ring in the mnz structure which has many electrons and causes the accumulation effect 63 other effective characteristics in the adsorption process include the specific surface area pore size and baroelectricity of the adsorbent surface the size of the pores on the surface of the adsorbents are divided into small pores with a diameter of 20 nm medium pores with a diameter of 20 to 500 nm and large pores with a diameter of 500 nm the size of the pores is usually inversely related to the specific surface area available for adsorption with small pores creating a higher specific surface area in the adsorbent 62 the small pores on the adsorbent surface are often effective in absorbing contaminants with small molecular sizes 64 the electric charge on the adsorbent surface is another important factor in the absorption of different pollutants by different adsorbents in adsorption systems phpzc is commonly used to evaluate the effect of this factor the phpzc represents the ph point of absorption system where positive and negative electric charges are in equilibrium so that if the ph of the medium is lower than phpzc the adsorbent surface will have a positive electric charge and if the ph is higher than phpzc the adsorbent surface will have a negative electric charge 61 63 in general although some interactions transpire the prime process that narrate mnz adsorption are electrostatic Ï Ï hydrophobic interactions h bonds and pore diffusion 64 fig 4 shows possible mechanisms for adsorption of antibiotics over adsorbents 65 4 adsorbents types for removal of mnz from water environments 4 1 carbon based compounds carbon based materials are used as effective adsorbents to remove water and wastewater contaminants in this and following sections the numerous systems and functions of activated carbon carbon nanotubes and graphene as promising adsorbents for the removal of mnz are investigated table 1 the application of carbon based materials is briefly mentioned 4 1 1 activated carbon activated carbon ac is common physical adsorbents the adsorbent is used to remove organic pollutants macromolecules colourants as well as taste and odour producing molecules ac is very porous and usually has a porosity of 1 5 g cm3 the ability of activated carbon to absorb organic matter is related to its surface and textural properties the use of activated carbon is limited due to its high cost 66 the raw materials used to produce activated carbon include wood coconut shell lignin hazelnuts walnuts coal and polymeric raw materials including rubber and plastic waste 67 mnz is often adsorbed using carbon based compounds 54 because it has a large surface area and pore volume that favour adsorption 17 talha et al showed the highest qmax of mnz as 303 mg g by zr iv metal organic frameworks 16 mnz adsorption has been achieved using ac from siris seeds 68 due to a koh microwave activation process it possesses a large specific surface area 1824 8 m2 g 68 the mnz absorption was endothermic and spontaneous with Ï Ï interactions hydrogen bonding and pore filling serving as the primary mechanisms graphene 28 69 commercial activated carbon 70 multi walled carbon nanotubes 71 ac from prosopis juliflora 72 carbon xerogel 70 and biochar from vallisneria natans 73 are some of the carbon based materials investigated for mnz adsorption ac is very effective due to its special surface and high adsorption capacity and surface pores in removal of organic pollutants adsorption by activated carbon is affected by sorbent qualities material properties and wastewater contamination thus all aspects influencing adsorption should be considered for absorption of any contaminants granular ac has a high adsorption capacity and is suitable for the adsorption of antibiotics with increasing retention time the qmax enhances absorption 74 the increase in adsorption could be associated to a growth in the frequency of meetings between pollutants and adsorbent and the high speed of the absorbent 75 researchers have applied ac to absorb antibiotics under flowing conditions however the prime issue with the usage of ac powder nano sized adsorbents or isolated nanoparticles thus the secondary pollution concern is the distribution and manufacture of this system most of these issues can be solved by using the adsorbent s magnetism 76 difficult regeneration is a marked disadvantage of ac as new ac would have to be produced from sludge and separated from the pollutants which can be difficult clogging and the long contact time required between water and the ac are also key issues however with ac there is minimal risk of producing new toxic compounds 77 4 1 2 carbon nanotubes in a carbon nanotube the carbon atoms are defined in a barrel shaped structure it is a hollow tube whose walls are made of carbon atoms the arrangement of carbon atoms in the wall of the cylindrical structure is exactly the same as the arrangement of carbon in graphite plates the carbon plates are stacked on top of each other and each layer is connected to the substrate through weak bonds and endolysis 81 the properties of these materials depend on the atomic order diameter and length of the tube and its morphology and structure carbon nanotubes have unique mechanical electrical optical and thermal properties and have a very high adsorption capacity for a variety of pollutants including heavy metals dye molecules and organic matter 82 chemical resistance high thermal stability and catalytic properties are other features of these materials 83 84 in terms of biological properties in a simple classification the biological interactions of nanotubes can be examined from both intracellular and extracellular dimensions depending on the diameter length and presence of the walls carbon nanotubes are divided into two categories fig 5a b 4 1 2 1 single wall carbon nanotubes swcn the swcn can be thought of as a graphite layer called a graphene layer in an integrated cylinder wrapped graphene sheets 85 theoretical calculations and experimental results on single wall carbon nanotubes show that they have very good mechanical thermal photochemical and electrical properties but are currently expensive 86 87 4 1 2 2 multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcn the mwcn can be thought of as a set of concentrated wall nanotubes consisting of several layers of graphite that rotate inward the length and diameter of these structures are very different from nano concrete wall samples and their characteristics are very different the layer spacing in mwcn is adjacent to the distance between the graphene layers in graphite and they have similar morphological properties and characteristics as single wall nanotubes 88 kariim et al recorded a qmax of mnz as 0 209 mg g 71 4 1 2 3 mechanisms of pollutant removal by carbon nanotubes the first factor to consider is the extent to which different contaminant molecules have access to the adsorption sites located in the structure of the materials fig 5c 89 it should be noted that the adsorption on the external grooves and sites on the surfaces is balanced much faster than the internal surfaces intranet channels and inside the tube in fact the outer surfaces are directly exposed to the contaminating molecules while the adsorption process on the inner surfaces starts from the end of the pore and then spreads to the inner sites 90 91 the second factor influencing the rate of adsorption is whether the two ends of the cap are open or closed because the openness of two or one end of the adsorbent allows contaminant molecules to reach the required points thus increasing the adsorption capacity 92 the third factor is the purity of the carbon nanotubes among the impurities in nanotubes are soot amorphous carbon and carbon particles surrounded by metal particles all of which reduce adsorption the capacity 83 the fourth factor is the type of oxygenated functional groups present on the surface of nanotubes generally the functional groups of these materials are oh oc and cooh and according to studies the formation of these functional groups improves the adsorption performance of contaminants on the other hand functional groups may upsurge diffusion resistance and reduce the surface area of the nanotubes reducing the levels available for organic compounds carbon nanomaterials are also widely used especially for various water contaminants such as detergents insecticides herbicides fats oils grease phenols volatile organic compounds antibiotics dyes ammonia salts as well as bacteria viruses fungi and algae 93 94 current research has shown that cnts are able to enter the body and may cause many adverse biological effects and even more so when pollutants are present 95 cnts have a high adsorption capacity for some bulky organic molecules like antibiotics because of their large pores in bundles and accessible sorption sites 96 4 1 3 graphene graphene oxide graphene is an attractive option for removing pollutants from aqueous systems due to its unique properties such as perfect carbon nanostructure with sp2 hybridization large specific surface area and strong interactions with other atoms and molecules 97 100 graphene is hydrophobic which benefits water purification graphene naturally removes water from it and when narrow pores are created water passes through it quickly this property has given rise to the idea of using graphene to filter and desalinate water especially now that technology has been developed to create such tiny pores 99 100 chemical structure and crystal structure of graphene compound are illustrated in fig 6a b 101 the graphene family includes reduced graphene oxide rgo graphene oxide go go and rgo with enhanced adsorptive characteristics can be produced by chemical oxidation of graphite and reduction of graphene oxide respectively fig 6c 101 graphene sheets on which very small pores are made are used as a means of purifying water as they allow water molecules to pass through and block the passage of contaminants and other particles light weight and small size of graphene are two factors that help to make water filters and salt separators scientists have discovered that thin membranes of graphene oxide in addition to being hydrophobic are impermeable to gases and vapours 97 98 further research has shown that a highly precise graphene lattice can separate atoms of impurities in water that are different but the same size at extremely high speeds in this way the purification process is done in the best possible way graphene or graphene oxides have a variety of environmental applications graphene oxide has been extensively studied because of its ability to remove contaminants such as antibiotics and heavy metals 97 100 theoretically graphene has several advantages such as high permeability when used as a membrane antibiotic adsorption on go is a physical process the advantage of this being that the carbon structure stays intact and unchanged 102 however it is difficult to ensure uniform fabrication control of pore sizes and graphene has poor mechanical stability 101 103 4 2 metal organic framework mofs mofs are a new generation of hybrid porous compounds that have been developed to utilize the capabilities of porous organic and inorganic materials the inorganic part of mofs can include simple metal cations such as zinc iron copper or rare metals such as scandium or metals such as aluminium gallium tin or hybrids of metals with oxygen fluoride chloride or hydroxide various organic linkers can be used this diversity of organic and inorganic components in suitable for physical and chemical synthesis conditions means there is room for manipulation and the ability to create a target structure 103 104 the most common methods for synthesizing mofs include solvo thermal and hydrothermal processes the reaction time for each of these processes varies from a few hours to a few days 105 attempts to make new mofs involve selecting the desired ligand as well as the appropriate metal salt and solvent selecting the molar ratios of the reactants and activating the conditions for the reaction to occur at specific times and temperatures by selecting the appropriate ligand with functional groups specific properties of the mof can be achieved even changes in the organic component of synthesized organic metal frames and changes in species of functional groups such as br nh2 ch3 can achieve a new composition with different properties a range of organic ligands are commercially available which can be modified and manipulated in vitro presently increasing attention to adsorption has led to the development of porous materials including ac mesoporous silicate materials porous organic polymers and mofs especially in the specific surface area porosity size and simple and easy synthesis compared to zeolites have attracted attention from researchers the Ï Ï interaction hydrophobicity hydrophilicity has led experts to consider the use of mofs in contaminant removal processes especially emerging contaminants as well as to study the predominant interaction of mof structure and properties 106 109 table 2 shows a review on mofs application for removal of mnz the large porosity and chemical tunability makes mofs beneficial for adsorption while their catalytic nature is beneficial for degradation of certain pollutants 110 while most mofs are of insufficient water stability severely impeding their applications in water several water stable mofs have been demonstrated in recent years mofs are generally in the form of crystalline powders which could cause secondary contamination in the treated water and this also makes them hard to recover and regenerate 111 4 3 nanoscale semiconductor photocatalysts nano sized compounds have particular physical chemical and biological characteristics that make them useful to chemical activity and allow them to interact with other materials hydrothermal and sol gel loading methods are examples of nanoparticle loading methods 75 76 nanoparticles with their small size exhibit mechanical magnetic optical electrical and chemical properties correction factors for contaminated aquatic environments include metals with zero capacity such as iron tin aluminium and zinc 114 optical nano photocatalyst processes are based on the formation of highly active species of hydroxyl radicals that are able to decompose a wide range of contaminants quickly 115 light activated nanoparticles such as high energy cleavage semiconductors which include titanium dioxide tio2 magnesium oxide nanoparticles mgo nps and zinc oxide zno are used because of their ability to remove and refine contaminants 116 tio2 nanoparticles are inexpensive non toxic have a strong oxidation capacity environmentally friendly and have a high surface to volume ratio under uv irradiation tio2 nanoparticles have the highest removal efficiency compared to other methods in recent years the use of heterogeneous photocatalysts especially tio2 to reduce organic pollutants and effluents have been studied extensively 114 117 118 the main mechanisms of the reactions are given in eqs 1 8 114 118 and fig 7 21 119 1 tio 2 hv h vb e cb 2 h vb h 2 o o h h 3 h vb oh o h 4 organics h vb products 5 e cb o 2 o 2 6 o 2 e cb o 2 2 7

recommended for use in heterogeneous photocatalysis process 120 121 the steps of the photocatalytic process for pollutant removal are shown in fig 8 122 recently zno nanoparticles have been used as sensors and as photocatalysts to purify pollutants researchers in this field are interested in manipulating the surface of nanoparticles with organic and inorganic dyes in order to increase the optical response from uv to visible light of these particles this makes nanoparticles of metal oxides more effective as photocatalysts for the conversion of environmental pollutants because the amplitude of uv light is only about 5 of the spectrum of sunlight nanoparticles have been selected as the most ideal nano photocatalysts due to their electron cavity pairs which have a high reducing power and oxidation to reduce oxygen and oxidize water to superoxide and hydroxyl radicals 114 the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants by zinc oxide as explained by the

nanophotocatalysts have enhanced activity over larger photocatalysts due to having a greater surface area and shape dependent features and properties 124 4 4 zero valent iron nanoparticles zero valent iron nanoparticles have a zero valent iron core with a cover of iron oxide hydroxide the thickness of which increases with the expansion of iron oxidation 125 due to the high reactivity of elemental iron oxidation of the nucleus is imminent when zero valent iron nanoparticles are exposed to air or water during environmental operations eqs 20 and 21 zero iron nanoparticles are oxidized corroded to produce ferrous iron 126 20 fe 0 2h 2 o fe 2 h 2 2h 2 o 21 fe 0 o 2 2h 2 o 2fe 2 4oh subsequent reactions of fe2 will result in the production of fe3o4 magnetite fe oh 2 hydroxyl phosphorus and fe oh

choice for the treatment of toxic and hazardous pollutants and the improvement of contaminated sites these properties have led to their increasing use in the treatment of environmental pollutants the mechanism of pollutant removal by iron nanoparticles is to reduce the pollutants to less hazardous products and then absorb them research shows that nanoparticles can be used as reducers and catalysts act to detoxify a large number of environmental pollutants zero capacity metals are effective factors in removing pollutants among these metals zero iron is preferred due to its abundance cheapness non toxicity rapid reactivity and high efficiency in the decomposition of contaminants such as antibiotics drug residues solvents pesticides and heavy metals 128 129 fang et al showed that mnz was completely removed by zero capacity iron nanoparticles the mnz solution at 80 mg l was rapidly removed by zero capacity iron nanoparticles within 5 min at initial solution ph 5 60 and zero capacity iron nanoparticle dose of 0 1 g l 130 wang found that 94 18 of mnz was removed using zero capacity iron nanoparticles css 131 emulsified zero valent iron nanoparticles can cause an increase in mobility of the contaminants and as always the potential ecological or human risk derived from the used of nanoparticles has to be considered 132 4 5 magnesium oxide nanoparticles mgo nps typically nanoparticles are suitable for chemical reactions and adsorption of various organic compounds due to their high specific surface area 133 the nanoparticles are easily accessible cheap non toxic stable reusable and have high adsorption capacity reactivity as well as unique mechanical electronic and optical properties 134 individual and energy band gap is a major feature of magnesium oxide nanoparticles in addition magnesium oxide is able to oxidize organic compounds to harmless compounds such as co2 and h2o band and formation of holes mgo surf h hole and free electrons mgo surf e on the surface of mgo occur mgo surf h with high oxidation ability leads to direct oxidation of organic pollutants some studies of mgo nanoparticles as catalysts have been used to remove organic pollutants in photocatalytic processes which increase the efficiency of removing organic pollutants from an aqueous medium 30 135 sun et al showed that the synthesized mg oh 2 nanoparticles in removal mnz in the catalytic ozonation process antibiotic concentration 10 500 mg l dosage of 1 0 g l time 15 min 134 kalhori et al showed optimum conditions with coating with mgo nanoparticles mgo leca as antibiotic concentration of 40 mg l adsorbent dosage of 1 0 g l ph 7 contact time of 150 min and bet 76 12 with a removal of 97 for mnz 136 4 6 nanocomposites nanocomposites consist of two phases the first phase is a crystalline design that in reality is the base of the nanocomposite and may be made of polymer metal or ceramic the second phase is nanometre scale particles that are distributed as reinforcements or fillers for specific purposes in the first phase and include power support electrical conductivity and magnetic properties 137 138 the most attention is paid to polymer based nanocomposites polymer nanocomposites have high durability low weight high thermal cohesion high electrical conductivity and high chemical resistance reinforcement of polymers using organic and mineral materials is common 139 nanocomposites play crucial role in the treatment of wastewater and tap water 140 nasseh et al synthesized a novel feni3 sio2 cus magnetic nano adsorbent and examined its ability to remove mnz from aqueous solutions at ph 7 contact time of 180 min nanocomposite dose of 0 1 g l at 20 c mnz adsorption was observed the absorption percentage increased significantly as the nano absorbent dosage increased from 24 18 to 62 18 after five adsorption desorption cycles the effectiveness of the magnetic nano adsorbent reduced marginally 54 malakootian et al a novel magnetic biocomposite adsorbent cofe2o4 activated carbon chitosan cf ac ch was synthesized and applied for metronidazole mnz adsorption show that optimal adsorption capacity q e of 36 897 mg g was obtained under optimal conditions as follows adsorbent dose 450 mg l ph 5 02 mnz initial concentration 22 35 mg l and contact time 46 25 min 53 balarak et al created polyaniline nanocomposites and found a significant potential for mnz removal with increasing solution temperature from 10 to 55 c the sorption capacity of the polyaniline humic acid pa ah composite increased when the temperature increased from 10 to 55 c the q max increased from 42 2 to 49 95 mg g 141 the efficiency and usability of nanocomposites are significantly improved in terms of nanoparticle dispersion stability and recyclability compared to free nanomaterials composites or polymers are highly tunable in terms of their porous structures mechanical properties and functional groups 142 4 7 chitin and chitosan based adsorbents a polymer is a substance made up of high mass molecules containing duplicate structural units or monomers joined together by covalent chemical bonds polymers are including two categories natural and synthetic polymers natural polymers are polymers that are generally found in living organisms and plants in the form of cellulose polysaccharides and proteins chitin is a natural polymer which is a dominant component of the cell wall in fungi chitin and its derivative chitosan have many applications in various fields 143 144 the most common source of chitin is crustaceans such as shrimp and crabs chitin is white hard inelastic cellulose with a nitrogen containing polysaccharide and a major source of surface contamination in coastal areas fig 9 146 chitosan has a higher percentage of nitrogen than cellulose this property makes chitin a useful chelating agent chitin and chitosan are good functionalizing agents because of their natural properties biocompatible biodegradable non toxic and adsorption properties 143 145 chitin is insoluble in water and many organic solvents due to its lipophilic properties and chitosan is soluble in dilute acid solutions at ph 6 chitosan has been introduced as a good adsorbent and coagulant due to the presence of amine nh2 and carboxyl oh groups in water and wastewater these sites are used as reaction sites for the purification process chitosan has other properties such as cationic polymer non toxic biodegradable good adsorption ability and antibacterial properties 145 chitosan can be modified by various methods to remove the desired contaminant from water chemically modified chitosan has been used for various environmental applications the modifications increase the elimination properties of metals and increase the stability of the polymer in acidic conditions these chitosan modifications increase the potential for the removal of contaminants 147 148 asgari et al used fe3o4 chitosan for 100 removal of mnz antibiotic concentration of 10 mg l adsorbent dosage of 2 g l ph 3 contact time 90 min 149 arghavan used feni3 chitosan bioi nanocomposite for 100 removal of mnz antibiotic concentration of 20 mg l adsorbent dosage of 0 04 g l ph 3 and contact time 200 min 150 chitosan polymers can be developed to have better capacities to adsorb wastewater pollutants and resist degradation in acidic environments also the cationic charge of chitosan is able to neutralise anionic particles it is abundant and biodegradable however potentially hazardous materials are required to regenerate chitosan 151 152 5 isotherm and kinetic models and thermodynamic studies 5 1 isotherm and kinetic models various recognised adsorption equilibrium isotherms shown in table 3 are investigated to identify mnz adsorption on to new generation adsorbents 138 relative uptake and excretion rates can be balanced by langmuir isotherms 53 the freundlich isotherm is describe adsorption processes at heterogeneous surfaces 4 the four kinetic models including conventional non linear and linear forms in table 4 are evaluated to understand the mechanics in adsorption process taking place in a batch process the best models are langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics table 5 summarizes the equilibrium isotherm and motion modelling for mnz uptake 5 2 thermodynamic studies of mnz temperature influences the adsorption process thus thermodynamic studies the thermodynamic parameters are standard gibbs free energy g enthalpy change h and entropy change s the enthalpy of adsorption is another significant feature of adsorption during adsorption the surface s residual forces decrease resulting in a drop in surface energy which manifests as heat as a result adsorption is always an exothermic process in other words adsorption enthalpy h is always negative when a gas is adsorbed the molecules freedom of movement is restricted this translates to a decrease in the adsorbate molecules entropy following adsorption i e s is negative adsorption results in a drop in the system s enthalpy as well as its entropy 28 the thermodynamic condition for a process to be spontaneous is that g must be negative under constant temperature and pressure i e there is a decrease in gibbs energy g can be negative if h has a sufficiently large negative value as ts is positive based on the eq g h ts as a result in a spontaneous adsorption process the combination of these two elements causes g to be negative as the adsorption process a progress h becomes less and less negative until it equals ts and g is zero at this point equilibrium has been achieved 163 as depicted in table 5 the adsorption process being exothermic because Î´h value is negative in study by balarak et al showed that mnz removal by go increase with increase in the temperature from 25 to 45 c 28 5 3 dynamic adsorption of mnz in a fixed bed column experiment experimental adsorption studies include batch treatment and column treatment studies in batch adsorption experiments a reactor tank is used to hold the adsorbent and adsorbate parameters such as ph temperature adsorbate concentration can be manipulated easily the advantages of this is that it is cost effective and the process is simple however it is not at all practical to use in large scale practical applications due to space constraints and the amount of adsorbate needed batch adsorption is thus perfect for preliminary small scale testing of an adsorbent adsorbate system 166 column adsorption studies known as fixed bed or packed bed consist of a column containing adsorbent the solution of adsorbate is passed through the column at an experiment specific flow rate various parameters can be adjusted similar to those in batch experiments the advantage of this technique as it allows for much higher adsorption than batch experiments using the same amount of adsorbent 167 the aim of fixed bed column mnz experiments is to understand the dynamic behaviour of an adsorbent when treating continuous flows of mnz contaminated water 163 this aids the design optimization building and monitoring a scaled up treatment system for field applications limited articles focus on adsorption of mnz in a fixed bed column shown in table 6 Ã§alÄ±Åkan and gÃ¶ktÃ¼rk tested the adsorption of sulfamethoxazole and mnz by ac in both batch and column mnz modes 168 in the fixed bed column experiments the effect of flow rate on adsorption capacity was determined and 200 mg l of both antibiotics were removed the authors found that the breakthrough curves for mnz were the same when the flow rate changed from 0 8 to 1 8 l h however when the flow rate increased the capacity of the fixed bed column as well as the breakthrough time decreased dÃ­az blancas et al studied the mechanisms responsible for the mass transfer during adsorption of mnz from water in a fixed bed column packed with granular activated carbon gac f400 169 the authors employed a fixed bed general model fbgm to simulate the breakthrough curves under various experimental conditions such as flow rate initial mnz concentration and bed height the outcomes showed that the fbgm perfectly simulated the experimental data under all operational conditions additionally surface diffusion was the most important mechanism during the dynamic adsorption of mnz and accounted for 80 100 of the total intraparticle transport manjunath and kumar prepared a glass column filled with activated carbon that was produced from prosopis juliflora pjac to investigate the simultaneous removal of mnz and other compounds i e phosphate po4 3 and nitrate no3 72 during the dynamic experiments the effect of flow rate mnz initial concentration and bed height on the performance of the glass column was elaborated the resulting breakthrough curves were anticipated using bed depth service time bdst adams bohart yoon nelson and thomas the modelling illustrated that the thomas model was the best in predicting the experimental data and the qmax of mnz by pjac was 9 70 mg g 6 desorption and reusability of mnz reclaiming of adsorbents for multiple cycles is important in water and wastewater treatment operations as it not only reduces the total expense of the treatment process but decreases the volume of the generated sludge 170 adsorbents can be successfully reused after creating a desorption protocol to effectively regenerate and prepare the exhausted adsorbents for new adsorption cycles 72 table 7 summarizes research on the desorption reclamation and recycling of adsorbents for efficient and effective removal of mnz from aqueous solutions carrales alvarado et al found that within 7 days both neutral ph 7 and acidic ph 2 solutions were able to fully desorb the mnz molecules from the surface of ac f400 and activated carbon cloth acf 29 manjunath et al utilized distilled water as an eluent to desorb the mnz molecules from the surface of powder ac and concrete containing graphene 72 the authors found that the distilled water could barely desorb 3 5 and 1 7 of mnz from powder ac and concrete containing graphene respectively after soaking in distilled water for almost a day it is important to mention that carrales alvarado et al and manjunath et al did not examine the possibility of recycling adsorbents for additional cycles 29 72 jafarzadeh et al synthesized go functionalized Î² cyclodextrin ag nanocomposite go Î² cd ag to adsorb low concentrations of mnz 0 25 mg l from water 171 the authors used go Î² cd ag washed with acetone and deionized water to desorb mnz from the surface following this regeneration protocol go Î² cd ag was successfully reused for three consecutive adsorption cycles where the removal efficiency declined from 89 3 to 75 28 furthermore nasseh et al regenerated exhausted magnetic nanocomposite feni3 sio2 cus after an adsorption process by washing out the adsorbed molecules of mnz from the surface of feni3 sio2 cus repeatedly using 0 5 m hcl and deionized water 54 the authors dried the feni3 sio2 cus in an oven at 80 c before proceeding to the next adsorption cycle they reported that the removal efficiency of feni3 sio2 cus deteriorated from 66 43 to 53 97 after five consecutive adsorption cycles because of the reduction in nanocomposite mass after each cycle alivand et al produced a nonporous carbon material from iranian asphaltene and functionalized it with amine groups ianc nh2 to efficiently remove both amoxicillin and mnz from water 172 in their experiment the authors used 3 m sodium hydroxide solution to desorb the two antibiotics from the surface of ianc nh2 and recycled for four adsorption processes following the first regeneration cycle the adsorption capacity of ianc nh2 for mnz decreased from 472 1 to 449 1 mg g due to the partial blockage of the amine functional group however ianc nh2 showed a stable performance in the following adsorption cycles till the end of the fourth cycle kahkha et al co precipitated fe3o4 on the surface of mwcn to produce mwcn fe3o4 mwcnts for mnz adsorption from water 173 the authors demonstrated that submersing fe3o4 mwcnts for 30 min in 2 ml methanol solution with 1 of naoh was enough to transfer the adsorbed mnz molecules back to the desorbing solution furthermore they reported that fe3o4 mwcnts was reused for 15 cycles and at the end of 15th cycle the adsorption capacity decreased from 163 to 87 mg g asgari et al magnetized chitosan powder by co precipitating fe3o4 cts mnzps to eliminate mnz 149 the authors employed two solutions for mnz desorption namely 5 hcl and 0 1 m naoh after the adsorption of mnz by cts mtzps the exhausted cts mtzps was magnetically collected and dried for 4 h at 45 c the desorption experiments revealed that the acidic medium 5 hcl favoured the desorption of mnz with 85 4 desorption on the other hand the alkaline solution desorbed only 40 of the mnz after five successive adsorption desorption cycles cts mtzps exhibited an outstanding performance in remediating mnz contaminated solutions with removal efficiencies 90 ahmadfazeli et al functionalized activated carbon by amine group to target mnz adsorption from water 8 in their research 0 1 m naoh was used to regenerate the activated carbon after the adsorption of mnz for five additional treatment cycles the regeneration results explained that the removal efficiency of mnz diminished from 95 48 to 73 41 at the end of the fifth adsorption cycle bonyadi et al thermally converted wheat straw to graphite oxide go and then modified it to produce amine modified green graphene amgg 56 the amgg demonstrated a remarkable mnz adsorption capacity 416 7 mg g moreover applying an acidic desorbing solution ph 4 for amgg promoted the adsorption of mnz with 77 removal efficiency in contrast 71 of mnz was removed by amgg after regeneration with an alkaline solution ph 10 thus the acidic medium was used to regenerate amgg for five adsorption cycles the reusability of amgg for five cycles decreased the removal of mnz from water as the adsorption percentage deteriorated from 84 to approximately 57 at the end of the last adsorption process 163 talha et al tested eight metal organic frameworks for the adsorption of mnz from water and concluded that uio 66 nh2 achieved the highest mnz adsorption capability 265 5 mg g 16 in addition uio 66 nh2was recycled for three adsorption cycles by simply washing the spent uio 66 nh2with deionized water acetone and absolute methanol to ensure the full desorption of mnz molecules before starting another cycle the significant loss in the mass of uio 66 nh2 after each recycling process reduced the adsorption capacity of mnz from 265 5 mg g to approximately 175 mg g after the third adsorption cycle usually the performance of adsorbents decreases after several adsorption cycles however zheng et al 163 reported an interesting finding about the performance of two types of conjugated microporous polymers cmps namely cmp a and cmp b after regenerating them using methanol and ultrasonication 169 they declared that the adsorption capacity of mnz by both polymers was significantly enhanced after the regeneration process this improvement could be attributed to the ultrasonication and washing process making the polymers more dispersed in the solution and ready to react with the mnz molecules 7 molecular modelling and simulation adsorption studies using molecular modelling and simulation have received much less attention than experimental studies nevertheless recent experimental studies on adsorption include theoretical molecular modelling it is worth mentioning that the theoretical modelling of adsorption does not yet account for all aspects of the process this is usually due to two reasons namely the modelling of adsorbent surface is not always possible except in a very few cases 157 and complete theoretical modelling requires expensive calculations that are not always tractable 174 therefore molecular modelling of adsorption is performed on only a few selected cases for which the adsorbent surfaces can be modelled in addition the computational methods are limited to affordable methods in this regard computational studies of mnz adsorption have been performed by a few authors using affordable computational approaches although a few studies have been reported using grand canonical monte carlo and artificial neural networks most of the theoretical investigations have been performed using density functional theory dft the majority of the studies used polyaniline polypyrrole and tio2 as adsorbents for the computational modelling fig 10 is an example of molecular adsorption of mnz using a mesoporous aluminium metal organic framework as adsorbent aarab and coworkers 72 174 175 performed theoretical molecular modelling of the adsorption of mnz using polyaniline and polypyrrole adsorbents the authors used dft and calculated the adsorption energy to evaluate adsorption strength one study modelled the adsorption of mnz onto polypyrrole at the b3lyp 6 31g d level of theory 157 the calculations were accomplished in the solvent phase using the solvation model conductor like polarizable continuum model cpcm the adsorption energy between mnz and polypyrrole was 428 kj mol this highlights that the adsorption process is instinctive and includes physisorption 157 in another study the authors performed both theoretical and experimental research to assess the performance of polyaniline polypyrrole for the removal of mnz 174 the theoretical study included dft at the b3lyp 6 31g d level of theory the authors evaluated the adsorption energy Î´h 37 3 kj mol and the result showed that the adsorption of mnz by polyaniline polypyrrole was spontaneous the molecular electrostatic potential showed that the adsorption mechanism took place through hydrogen bonding between the oxygen atoms of mnz and the nh and ch groups of the polyaniline polypyrrole adsorbent 174 furthermore adsorption of mnz and sodium salicylate molecules onto polyaniline was reported by aarab and coworkers 175 the investigation used dft at the b3lyp 6 31g d level of theory the adsorption energy was calculated as 572 4 and 249 4 kj mol for mnz and sodium salicylate respectively 175 these values indicated that the adsorption of mnz and sodium salicylate by polyaniline was a spontaneous process the authors concluded that the adsorption process of mnz and sodium salicylate by polyaniline was physisorption 175 in addition to polyaniline and polypyrrole tio2 has been used for the computational modelling of mnz adsorption tio2 polymer composites were used for the removal of mnz in a perdew burke emzerhof pbe functional of dft 176 the authors calculated the adsorption energies and evaluated the adsorption in gas phase and in water different composites were tested for the adsorption of mnz of which polyvinyl alcohol chitosan blend supported tio2was the best adsorbent for mnz 176 wang et al performed a theoretical study on the adsorption of mnz onto tio2 surfaces the adsorption was performed using the 101 and 001 surfaces of tio2 at the pbe dnp level of theory dispersion corrections were considered and the calculations carried out in both gas and solvent phase different adsorption sites were tested for 101 surface the maximum adsorption energy was 1 69 ev and 3 11 ev in the gas and water phase respectively for the surface 001 1 58 ev and 3 12 ev were reported as the maximum adsorption energy in the gas and water phase respectively 131 the adsorption of mnz onto the tio2 101 and 001 surfaces was investigated by qin et al 177 using pbe functional of dft including a d3 dispersion correction the calculations were performed in the gas phase and three different solvents and different adsorption sites were examined the adsorption energy was between 0 95 and 3 11 ev for the tio2 101 surface and between 0 84 and 3 29 ev for the tio2 001 surface 177 bismuth oxychloride biocl and manganese doped bismuth oxychloride mtz biocl have been used for the adsorption of mnz molecule in pbe dft modelling the surface 001 was used for the adsorption after saturation with hydrogen atoms 178 in addition adsorption of mnz onto boron nitride hydrogenated graphene and boron carbide surfaces was assessed using dft 179 for each surface different adsorption sites were considered the qmax energy was 44 50 kj mol with a boron carbide surface while the minimum adsorption energy was found with hydrogenated graphene surface 179 for all the complexes the adsorption enthalpy was negative highlighting the spontaneous adsorption process it is worth noting that the investigation was performed both in gas and solvent phase the authors found that a boron carbide surface realised the maximum adsorption energy in both gas phase and water 179 more dft studies of the adsorption of mnz are reported in the literature min et al investigated theoretical and experimental biodegradation of pharmaceutical pollutants including mnz the theoretical investigations were performed using dft at the b3lyp 6 31 g d p level of theory the authors calculated quantum chemical descriptors of the pollutants the electrophilicity of the compounds was the key factor in determining the biodegradation process 180 alivand et al carried out experimental and theoretical investigations of the adsorption of mnz and amoxicillin on waste derived nanoporous carbon they used dft pbe dnp including dispersion corrections to account for the van der waals interactions the waste borrowed nanoporous carbon was modelled using functionalized pristine molecule with pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen atoms the adsorption energy was 95 02 and 65 51 kj mol for amoxicillin and mnz respectively which indicated that the adsorption was more favourable for amoxicillin than mnz 172 adsorption of mnz using artificial neural networks and grand canonical monte carlo simulations has been reported extractions of pharmaceutical pollutants including mnz were investigated using artificial neural networks which predicted a removal efficiency of 97 64 for mnz 181 talha and coworkers investigated the adsorption of mnz using zirconium iv metal organic frameworks zr mofs both experimentally and theoretically the theoretical study used the grand canonical monte carlo simulation and the pbe functional of dft 16 and it is worth noting that advanced oxidation processes were used for the extraction of mnz in addition to adsorption xu et al reported the fragmentation mechanisms of mnz using advanced oxidation processes different degradation pathways were proposed along with the resulting fragments all calculations were performed using dft at the m06 2x 6 311 g d p level of theory 182 computational and theoretical molecular modelling of the adsorption of mnz has received less attention compared to experimental studies the investigations were performed mainly using dft although two studies used artificial neural networks and grand canonical monte carlo simulations some authors investigated solvent effects on the adsorption energy using implicit solvation models as most of the real adsorption processes take place in water or other solvents a proper modelling of the mnz adsorption should take solvent effects into account currently either the solvent effects have not been considered or are considered using implicit solvation models implicit solvation models are known to be inefficient for short range solvation thus for accurate modelling of the solvent effects one should consider explicit solvation models or a combined explicit and implicit solvation model the latter is perfectly modelled using the so called qm mm approach quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics in addition previous work did not consider the dynamical evolution of the mnz adsorption therefore investigations using molecular dynamics for real time monitoring of the adsorption processes are recommended 8 knowledge gaps future perspectives mnz is in competition with other molecules for adsorption materials often dimetridazole dtz is preferentially adsorbed above mnz especially by activated carbons because of its higher electron density and smaller molecule size 29 other competitors include lead 70 phosphate and nitrate 72 future studies should include these competitors for more realistic adsorption studies and to demonstrate the affinity of the adsorbent for mnz various computational modelling techniques have been used to simulate the adsorption of mnz from aqueous solution dÃ­az blancas et al used a diffusion model to determine the adsorption rate of mnz on granular activated carbon at different concentrations the authors found that surface volume diffusion was more relevant than pore volume diffusion 169 the same conclusion was made by flores cano et al 80 density functional theory calculations were used by aarab et al 157 who found that the adsorption process using polypyrrole was governed by physical interactions it is worth doing more computational modelling to determine which physical and chemical characteristics are desirable in an adsorbent many studies focused on the use of batch adsorption whereas continuous column mnz adsorption might be better suited solute concentration is the most important physiochemical parameter in the adsorption process and continuous column mnz is easy to operate the adsorption is fast and the experiment can easily be scaled for large scale implementation these properties make column mnz adsorption advantageous over batch adsorption which often requires long idle times few studies explored continuous column mnz adsorption further dÃ­az blancas et al 173 did a continuous column mnz adsorption study with activated carbon which yielded promising results it is worthwhile to investigate other column mnz packing materials 169 desorption and reusability require further investigation when adsorption is by physical interaction as is the case with the majority of adsorbents then elution and desorption is relatively simple and should not require dangerous eluents like strong acids for practical reasons the adsorbent used should be relatively reusable otherwise the adsorption process would become costly and create masses of new pollutants which need to be disposed of in a way that will not further pollute soil and groundwater future studies should include these competitors for more realistic adsorption studies and to demonstrate the affinity of the adsorbent for mnz 9 conclusion this paper showed a review a suite of recent works discusses the ecotoxicology of mnz mechanism of adsorption of mnz from pharmaceutical wastewater adsorbent types and their adsorption capacities empirical findings on the kinetics and thermodynamics also it discussed molecular modelling and simulation of mnz removal from pharmaceutical wastewater previous work did not consider the dynamical evolution of the mnz adsorption the result shows that mtd mof5 nanocomposite adsorbents have more qmax equal 539 33 mg g the langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics model reported to best describe the isotherm and kinetic model respectively solute concentration is the most important physiochemical parameter in the adsorption process and continuous column mnz is easy to operate the adsorption is fast and the experiment
