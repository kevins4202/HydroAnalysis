5245,debris flows are among the most destructive natural processes to affect areas of mountainous terrain debris flow formation involves watershed scale processes of hydrology and material supply this study explored both processes based on long term monitoring data from the jiangjia gully in southwestern china based on hydrological simulations we found that the debris flows formed as normal or abnormal hydrological processes the former with normal time lag τ and normal peak discharge q max formed as a typical hydrological process in which slope failure material was mixed instantaneously with channel runoff conversely the latter with longer time lag τ and or abnormal discharge q max formed through blockage and outburst associated with landslides we found that the different types of debris flow required similar rainfall conditions and that the threshold could be expressed as i 6 25 d 0 73 0 5 d 14 5 h furthermore we established that rainfall pattern influences debris flow occurrence that is such events are more likely during short duration rainfall the findings of this study highlight the significance of soil supply to the process of debris flow formation via random disturbance of the normal hydrological process keywords debris flow formation process slope failure rainfall condition jiangjia gully 1 introduction debris flows which occur frequently in mountainous catchments are triggered by rainfall and are supplied with material from slope failures landslides rockfalls and fluvial sediment transport as observed around the world debris flows generally move in the form of surges for example marchi et al 2002 mccoy et al 2012 navratil et al 2013 hürlimann et al 2014 cui et al 2018 that appear as a wave like motion of high density liquid with a certain volume and shape as observed in jiangjia gully jjg a well known debris flow catchment in southwestern china each debris flow event comprises tens or hundreds of separate surges that have different discharges densities and material contents the findings of previous investigations of the spatiotemporal characteristics of surges within events wu and kang 1993 li et al 2003 2004 2008 liu et al 2008 2009 suggest that surges should develop in a system with certain underlying dynamics that might include both deterministic and stochastic components hallerberg et al 2007 many factors and mechanisms have been proposed that might operate to produce surge waves such as the structure fluid instability and roll waves of debris flows weir 1982 ng and mei 1994 wan and wang 1994 hungr 2000 such theories originate from the perspective of flow movement and ignore the formation processes however observations indicate that successive surges have different properties thus as they are likely to originate from multiple sources they cannot be described using a single flow model as illustrated by processes on individual slopes guo et al 2016a intermittent and random failures might supply materials to debris flows in a process that leads naturally to separate surges thus the formation mechanism of surges should be traced to the sources throughout a watershed although monitoring on debris flow formation in headwater regions has been undertaken recently for example marchi et al 2002 mcardell et al 2007 hürlimann et al 2014 2019 mccoy et al 2012 navratil et al 2013 comiti et al 2014 cui et al 2018 theule et al 2018 coviello et al 2019 and records of rainfall and related flows have helped reconstruct scenarios of debris flow occurrence real time formation processes have rarely been observed this is understandable considering the risks and difficulties associated with obtaining field observations during an actual debris flow event although debris flow discharge can be inferred from the rainfall and the material supplies building such a reliable calculation method requires accurate and long term monitoring of the involved parameters at an appropriate spatial scale and frequency in practice such monitoring typically encounters two great difficulties first rainfall has high spatial variability in mountainous valleys which means that a single gauge cannot reflect local rainfall events even within the confined region of a specific watershed for example nikolopoulos et al 2014 2015 guo et al 2016b 2016c cui et al 2018 second a debris flow surge is a sudden event of short duration usually lasting no longer than a few dozen seconds which makes physical monitoring of such events problematic because of these difficulties it can be hard to determine both the precise time of occurrence of a surge and the triggering rainfall which hinders investigation of the process of debris flow formation fortunately both long term records of rainfall from widely distributed gauges and observations of debris flows in jjg have made it possible to trace the related hydrological processes and material supplies of debris flow events the objective of the present study was to provide a comprehensive picture of surge formation based on 36 debris flow events to illustrate how a surge develops as material sources respond to different rainfall amounts over an entire catchment 2 study area and data source 2 1 general introduction of jjg debris flow events occur frequently in jjg approximately 10 events per year and each event comprises tens or hundreds of separate surges which makes the gully an ideal location for real time monitoring of debris flows for example davies 1986 1990 li et al 2003 2004 2008 chen et al 2005 cui et al 2005 kang et al 2006 liu et al 2008 2009 since its establishment in the 1960s the dongchuan debris flow observation and research station operated by the chinese academy of science has compiled a huge database of debris flows which includes information on more than 500 events the watershed fig 1 is located to the east of the xiaojiang fault and is characterized by intense tectonics the watershed is 48 6 km2 and about 80 of the exposed rocks are highly fractured and mildly metamorphosed debris flows always occur in the rainy season early june to late september and the average annual rainfall ranges between 400 and 1000 mm the length of the mainstream channel is 15 5 km and it comprises three sections 1 the erosion zone length 10 0 km average gradient 17 0 2 the transport zone length 1 3 km average gradient 5 1 and 3 the deposition zone length 4 2 km average gradient 3 7 cui et al 2005 from the perspective of debris flows jjg is a rather large valley in such a watershed a debris flow is not a full valley process rather every surge originates only from certain tributaries depending on the spatial distribution and activity of potential source slopes as the monitoring section is located near the station fig 1 this study focused on the areas upstream of the section currently the principal material sources are distributed mainly in menqian gully fig 1 where colluvium is distributed widely on the slopes and in the channels there are three major tributaries in menqian gully all of which have deep cut channels with unstable slopes and broken rocks and landslides in the source regions although the tributaries in the southern duozhao gully are also mantled with highly weathered rocks check dams control the formation of debris flows 2 2 data source 2 2 1 rainfall monitoring monitoring of rainfall in source areas is fundamental for predicting debris flow occurrence for this purpose 10 rain gauges have been installed in jjg of which four r1 r4 are located within or near the major source area menqian gully fig 1 these gauges measure rainfall using a 0 1 mm tipping bucket and the data are transmitted in real time via the general packet radio service debris flow monitoring in the following the term flow includes both water flow and debris flow generally water flow is difficult to monitor because of natural shifting of the riverbed and damage by frequent debris flows therefore debris flows are the monitoring objective in jjg for this study debris flow parameters were measured manually and recorded at the monitoring section fig 1 the appearance time of a debris flow front surge t 1 end time of the overall debris flow event at the monitoring section t 2 duration d f and surge number n were recorded directly the flow velocity v was determined using a stopwatch to measure the duration of the passage of the flow front through two sections within a 200 m long channel fig 2 a and flow height h and width w were estimated by experienced experts the discharge q was calculated using the expression q vh notably this v is regarded as the velocity of the debris flow body rather than the surface velocity additionally samples of the moving debris flow bodies which were collected using a volume calibrated sampling container controlled by electronic devices fig 2b were used for density ρ and volume sediment concentration cv analyses 2 2 2 data processing this study considered data acquired from all 36 debris flows that occurred between 2006 and 2017 table 1 information on one debris flow event as an illustration of the records of individual events is provided in table 2 each debris flow event comprised intermittent surges continuative flows between the surges and the tail after the end of all surges during the research period the highest and lowest numbers of surges recorded in a single event were 98 and 3 respectively each surge lasted approximately 10 s and the interval between surges ranged from tens to hundreds of seconds the flows were typical high density viscous debris flows with evident fronts and tails the density of the surge flows was generally greater than 2 0 g cm3 with high concentration of fine particles the discharge of the surges fluctuates by up to three orders of magnitude from 10 to greater than 1000 2262 5 m3 s continuative flows generally occurred between two surges or persisted for longer than 0 5 h as a tail after the surges and their discharge was always 10 m3 s the density of the continuative flow was also as high as 1 7 g cm3 and even greater than 2 0 g cm3 in some cases 3 activity of source material in the headwater regions field observations and photos shot by an unmanned aerial vehicle revealed that debris flows are potentially initiated by landslides shallow slope failures coalescing slope rills and erosion of loose slope channel materials in tributaries here menqian gully is taken as an example for introduction of source material activities fig 3 a landslides are the main source type in the headwater region of the three tributaries the mechanism via which rainfall infiltration can initiate shallow landslides is well known reid et al 1988 iverson et al 1997 2000 the landslides generally occur with heights of 30 200 m from the lowest channel to the top trailing edge on steep slopes of 35 40 fig 3b although not necessarily observed specifically head erosion caused by landslides is known to be very active because farmland above the top edge of the landslides retreats markedly each year in addition to the headwater region of the tributaries landslides are also distributed densely along the channels in the upstream region of menqian gully fig 3c the gradients vary on the slopes above the channels fig 3d the upper sections with gradients of 20 30 are covered with sparse shrubs and grass middle sections are covered by loose soils on slopes of 25 30 the shallow soils and steep gradients on the upper parts facilitate rainfall infiltration and surface runoff generation the bedrock which comprises mainly fragile phyllite is exposed on the lower sections with gradient of 35 40 the weathered rock surfaces are seriously eroded by upper runoff and the interflow stimulates translational landslides the bottom of the slopes is generally loose colluvium with a natural angle of around 30 intense channel runoff during rainstorms also plays an important role through erosion of the slope colluvium which increases slope instability and stimulates failure along the channels shallow slope residue and surface rill erosion frequently provide ubiquitous supply to the flow the slopes which are highly weathered and soil mantled are covered with deluvium comprising gravels and clay particles that is ready to fail under any circumstance fig 3e slope rill formation is largely dependent on the local hydrological response of the various hillslope materials on the high steep slopes above the talus the heads of the rills are largely exposed bedrock on steep slopes as the slopes are naturally uneven in their lower part the rills are formed by a combination of overland flow from relatively impermeable materials and lateral flow through highly permeable materials during periods of rainfall intense precipitation in upstream areas causes a firehose effect by turning slope sediments into flow that deeply incises the channel and causes lateral erosion along the rills which are predominately lined with fragile bedrock coe et al 1997 2008 griffiths et al 2004 godt and coe 2007 the materials are deposited lower on the fans and downslope in the stream valleys although the material volume of each rill is relatively small the dense distribution of the rills for example seven rills concentrated on a 200 m wide slope means that the fans combine to form a large deposit region in the channel fig 3f the tributaries also act as crucial contributors to debris flow formation in the main channel in the following a right hand small tributary with area of 0 3 km2 is taken for illustration the upper region of the tributary is covered by sparse grass on a slope of 20 25 which concentrates the overland flow during periods of rainfall the debris flow head region is a funnel shaped trough formed by head erosion related landslide failure the landslides are caused by the combination of rainfall infiltration and the lateral and incised erosion of upstream runoff fig 3g the channel is very steep and has a gradient similar to that of the slope that is 20 25 along one side of the channel small rills are densely developed on weak phyllite bedrock outcrops on the other side loose weathered clastic particles accumulated widely on the slopes these materials represent a nearly unending supply for debris flows the severe deeply incised and lateral erosion significantly aggravate the aforementioned slope failures fig 3h the formed debris flow fan has length of about 70 m which is sizable considering the relatively small area of the tributary we inferred that debris flows historically blocked the channel not only because the debris flow fan extends more than 100 m downstream in the main channel fig 3i but also because similar debris flow residues are evident on the other side of the river the debris flow source supply and formation process are rather typical of tributaries in this region that is a steep slope deep cut channel erodible slope surface and fragile exposed bedrock although debris flows in the tributaries represent part of the flows formed in the main channel the main processes differ because of the different controlling factors such as channel slope conditions in the tributaries vertical and lateral erosion are intense therefore the debris flows formed move downstream quickly in response to the straight and steep channel conditions conversely the channel blocking phenomenon which reduces the extent of vertical incision via changing the channel undulation is evident in many sections in menqian gully the formation of a landslide debris flow dam relies on the material properties such as volume velocity and composition runoff features such as discharge velocity and interactive conditions such as deflection confluence angle dal sasso et al 2014 fan et al 2014 chen et al 2019 nevertheless in upstream areas the considerable volume of the failure bodies narrow channels widths of only several meters and direct interaction represent ideal conditions for instantaneous landslide blockages in the channel fig 3c furthermore in downstream areas blockages of tributary debris flows are very obvious and serious not only in terms of their spatial distribution but also with respect to their frequency of occurrence for example five cascaded debris flow fans were found in a 1 0 km channel section several of which were closely connected fig 3j moreover the vertical stratification of the fans showed that they were not formed by a single debris flow event the failures processes of cascaded fan bodies are rather complex which means it is difficult to determine their exact breaking time and magnitude cui et al 2013 overall the source materials of debris flows are distributed spatially throughout menqian gully from the headwater region to the outlet fig 1 we estimated that the debris flow source area is 9 4 km2 accounting for around 73 of the entire area of menqian gully which can be regarded as an unlimited supplier for producing debris flows the abundant quantity of material and the diversity of supply modes result in a process of debris flow formation that is extremely sensitive to rainfall in which the water requirement in the tributaries is reasonably low it has been observed that debris flows can move at almost any time in small tributary channels even with negligible water discharge such as spring water 4 hydrological process related to debris flows 4 1 identification of rainfall responsible for debris flows as a debris flow forms from multiple sources in the tributaries and rainfall is distributed unevenly over the valley it is difficult but fundamentally important to identify the rainfall responsible for debris flow occurrence this involves determining where and at what time the flow begins this can be achieved by comparing recorded surges and rainfalls and the spatial correlation between potential material sources and rainfall distribution the initiation time influences the determination of the rainfall event responsible for the flow that is the inducing rainfall amount and triggering intensity over 10 min 30 min and 1 h which ultimately influences the analysis of rainfall thresholds and flow formation processes in fact the initiation time is seldom known with precision in most cases the triggering time is assumed as the instant at which the rainfall reaches maximum intensity iadanza et al 2016 in this case observations indicate that most occurrences 25 36 happened at rainfall intensities 5 mm h but with peaks in the tens of minutes prior to debris flow occurrence thus this peak period was taken as the rainfall period responsible for debris flow occurrence as rainfall is highly heterogeneous even gauges r1 r4 in menqian gully which are 2 km apart present spatial variations therefore the rainfall recorded at the different gauges plays different roles in flow formation generally the rainfall recorded at the four gauges presents the following features fig 4 1 rainfall is very small for example 5 mm h except for one or two gauges for example greater than10 mm h the area s neighboring the exceptional rain gauge s could be regarded as the most likely potential debris flow source and thus the data from the gauge s were taken to represent the rainfall responsible 2 rainfall is uniform for example close to 10 mm h all slopes could be considered potential source areas and therefore the arithmetic mean value was used 3 rainfall recorded by all gauges was considerable for example 15 mm h all slopes were considered the source region of debris flow initiation but the minimum value of the rain gauges was used to attempt to identify thresholds fig 4 diagrams illustrating identification of rainfall responsible for debris flows using this determination method the gauges used for a debris flow were identified as listed in table 1 rg it must be admitted that this identification is not a systematic procedure but relies on experience and on knowledge of debris flow formation processes however this is unavoidable and the error could be controlled to a certain extent through consideration of the universal regulation derived from using more than 30 events that provided actual rainfall cases with spatial differences the key point is that both the rainfall amount threshold for debris flow initiation and the time lag from peak rainfall to debris flow appearance discussed in the following can be quantified based on this temporal and spatial identification procedure based on determination of the location and initiation time of a debris flow the characteristics of the rainfall event can be estimated from the available rain gauge data the following indices are of special interest 1 inducing rainfall r i mm the cumulative rainfall from the beginning of the rainfall event to the time of debris flow occurrence 2 mean inducing rainfall intensity i mm h obtained by dividing the inducing rainfall r i by the duration from the beginning of the rainfall event to the time of debris flow occurrence d 3 triggering rainfall r t mm the direct triggering rainfall in 1 h 30 min and 10 min periods 4 antecedent rainfall ra mm the weighted sum of rainfall days prior to the occurrence of a debris flow which can be defined as cui et al 2007 guo et al 2013 2017 1 r a i 1 n r i k i where ri is the daily rainfall in the preceding n days i designates the exact number of days prior to the debris flow incident 1 i n and k is a decay coefficient of the i th day suggested values for k and n are 0 8 and 10 respectively statistical information of the rainfall is listed in table 3 among other factors inducing rainfall r i and triggering rainfall r t are the direct causes of debris flow occurrence guo et al 2016c 2017 it is evident that the value of each rainfall factor varies markedly for example the inducing rainfall amount varies from 5 1 to 58 4 mm and the triggering 10 min 30 min and 1 h rainfall varies in the ranges 1 1 15 3 3 0 27 4 and 5 1 50 8 mm respectively this indicates the difficulty of predicting debris flows based on a single parameter and reveals that the triggering condition is highly uncertain therefore the reasons for debris flow occurrence should be investigated comprehensively 4 2 hydrological calculation for water flow estimation on the watershed scale a debris flow is considered a product of a rainfall induced hydrological process involving the supply of soil material this involvement influences the flow discharge density and time of peak discharge from a hydrological perspective the discharge and time lag from peak rainfall to debris flow appearance at the monitoring section appear to take special roles in reflecting the runoff yield and flow influx processes notably shallow soil failures and rill erosions contribute primarily to frequent normal debris flows whereas a landslide debris flow dam outburst usually results in a catastrophic abnormal debris flow according to the classification of bardou and jaboyedoff 2008 a normal hydrological process is water dominated and the debris flow hydrograph comprises water and instantaneous sediment volume in an abnormal debris flow the time lag might be longer than normal and the peak discharge would be amplified considerably because of the blockage outburst as observed in many other sites cui et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 2015 in this watershed a combined rainfall runoff and routing method was used to estimate the maximum water flow because data on water flood discharges are unavailable this method has also been applied in related previous research lumbroso and gaume 2012 capra et al 2018 first the rainfall was interpolated using the thiessen polygon method and the watershed was divided into subregions based on units of slope then for each slope subregion the runoff yield was calculated based on the us soil conservation service scs curve number cn method scs 1985 mishra and singh 2003 in the scs method the volume of water runoff produced is estimated through the single parameter cn which summarizes the influence of both superficial aspects and deep soil features including the saturated hydraulic conductivity type of land use and humidity before the precipitation event we suggest that the larger the value the greater the runoff yield generally cn values are identified via a lookup table from the handbook scs 1985 the kinematic wave routine method was used to simulate the propagation and influx process of the water flow 4 3 validation of the hydrological calculation validation of the results for water flow was rather difficult because of the lack of measurements of water flood discharges in recent studies validation was performed by comparing the time of the peak of the simulated hydrograph with the time of detection of debris flow occurrence at monitoring stations at other sites lumbroso and gaume 2012 capra et al 2018 in this work the validation process not only compared the time lag τ also compared the total water flow amount time lag the time lag τ from the time of the triggering rainfall to debris flow appearance at the monitoring section is a principal index that represents the propagation process after identification of the rainfall responsible for a debris flow the time lag τ can be analyzed through comparison of the rainfall and surge hydrograph the results indicate that time lag τ generally falls within the range of 30 min to 1 1 h average 50 min table 1 depending on the material supply and flow influx processes this lag is therefore considered a key parameter for distinguishing normal and abnormal events for normal cases we inferred that the peak rainfall period is within 1 h of debris flow appearance however in some abnormal cases the lag is much longer as listed in table 1 for example the 2010 8 5 debris flow captured at the monitoring section at 05 51 all times given are local time occurred 10 5 h after the peak rainfall and even 10 h after the rain stopped which indicates that the debris flow was not an instant response to the rainfall the hydrological simulation is unsuitable under such circumstances therefore the simulation and validation of water flow were performed only for events with a normal time lag that is 1h total water flow volume because the debris flow surges rather than the real water flow hydrographs were measured directly the calculation of the total water amount should be explained as shown in the generalized sketch fig 5 a a monitored debris flow hydrograph comprises several discontinuous surges together with continuative flows between the surges and continuative flows appear as tails after the surges have ended for continuative flows between two surges that were not completely recorded we assumed that they had discharge qd and cv values similar to those of the first continuative flow after all surges had ended the total volume of a surge is simplified as a triangle shape because the discharges of the debris flow front and tail are different whereas a continuative flow is relatively steady and can be simplified as a rectangle shape for volume calculation as a debris flow is a mixture of water and soil the water flow discharge q w of each surge can be estimated based on the debris flow discharge q d using eq 2 2 q w q d 1 c v and the total amount is the integral sum of the surges and the following continuative flows considering both the uncertainty in monitoring and the assumptions in the data processing of the total water flow amount an acceptable error range of 20 20 was adopted as shown in fig 6 a the simulation errors are in the range of 15 6 17 7 with an average value of 7 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is 93 and the correlation coefficient is 96 meanwhile the debris flow occurrence time corresponds to the peak water discharge period fig 6b the validation of flow propagation time and total flow amount verified the parameters used in the hydrological calculation which allowed the simulation s acceptable accuracy and provided a method with which to assess any obvious abnormal relation between water flow discharge and debris flow discharge 4 4 criterion for discriminating normal from abnormal events the real ratio of debris flow discharge to water flow discharge is generally under the upper limit value of 3 3 considering that the measured cv is in the range 0 514 0 767 however the conditions of the ratio ϒ between the debris flow discharges and calculated water flow discharges differed this can help to distinguish normal from abnormal events for instance the 2013 6 7 event was used as a case study to illustrate this ratio fig 7 it was selected because it had the highest event rainfall 77 0 mm and 1 h rainfall intensity 50 8 mm h of all the studied events as recorded at r2 moreover it also had considerable antecedent rainfall of 34 4 mm during the 10 d period prior to the event date the actual value used to represent the real runoff yield condition for peak discharge was approximately 90 m3 s the simulated peak flow time was 03 30 04 00 and the first debris flow surge was monitored at 03 45 additionally we also used for reference a value of cn 90 for the entire watershed which is very high and almost impossible to achieve especially for the high permeability of the loose material of the soil surface in the source region the result indicates that the upper limit of runoff discharge in this watershed fig 7 was no greater than 120 m3 s in this case the potential maximum value of debris flow discharge is in the range of 360 480 m3 s based on eq 2 the ratio ϒ is regarded as normal because the monitored debris flow discharge was 357 m3 s in some cases the upper limit of the simulated water flow peak discharge was much smaller than the monitored debris flow discharges for instance the simulated maximum q w of the 2007 7 25 event was 53 8 m3 s and the monitored cv at the simulated peak water flood period was in the range of 0 72 0 75 which indicates that the debris flow discharge q d was in the range of 192 1 215 2 m3 s additionally the potential maximum water flow cn 90 was 66 4 m3 s which indicates a debris flow discharge q d with an upper limit of 265 6 m3 s however the monitored peak discharge of q max 2263 m3 s is much higher than this value in this circumstance the relation is considered abnormal because it does not reflect a normal hydrological process instead it represents the outburst of blockage bodies in the upper steam which significantly amplify the discharge the ratio ϒ of more than 50 of debris flows was greater than 3 3 fig 8 the maximum ϒ was 15 6 which indicates a significant amplification effect 5 possible processes of debris flow formation in this section the hydrographs of some typical debris flow cases are taken as examples with which to explain the hypothesis and the rainfall conditions required are analyzed to indicate the formation processes 5 1 typical cases analysis 5 1 1 events with normal τ and ϒ as shown in fig 9 the rainfall in the 2009 8 4 event was concentrated between 04 30 and 05 45 and the debris flow appeared at the monitoring section at 05 24 at the beginning of the event the rainfall peak started at r1 with a peak amount of 13 3 mm in 15 min 04 32 04 46 this was followed shortly by a burst of rainfall at r4 04 38 04 57 with a peak amount of 18 3 mm although the rainfall recorded at r3 was smaller than at r1 and r4 the peak lasted longer until 05 05 with 18 5 mm recorded in the previous 30 min the rainfall values recorded were all sufficient to induce debris flows according to historical records guo et al 2013 therefore it is difficult to identify the exact time and location of the debris flow initiated during 04 30 05 00 however by comparing the rainfall and debris flow processes the time lag was identified as 36 54 min the rainfall continued over the gully therefore all the tributaries might have been activated to supply materials even within the short peak period of 30 min the alternate peaks in the different tributaries might have expanded the region of debris flow initiation and extended the period of slope failure which potentially increased the number of surges and the duration of the debris flow the mean discharge of this debris flow was 60 6 m3 s with a peak of 194 8 m3 s the debris flow surges persisted until 06 18 although the flow after this time was still a type of debris flow it was more representative of a tail that behaved as a continuative flow with a much smaller discharge the hydrological simulation shows that the peak period of water flow discharge concurred with debris flow occurrence with a peak value of 64 3 m3 s the ratio ϒ was in the range of 1 3 which is reasonable for a normal water soil mixture the debris flow formation processes in the source region were not observed in situ however it can be inferred that slope failures occurred continuously in all tributaries and that the material became intermittently mixed with the water flood 5 1 2 events with a normal τ and abnormal ϒ the 2008 8 8 debris flow event fig 10 accompanied rainfall of long duration 32 h and low intensity 6 mm h at each rain gauge however it followed a considerable amount of antecedent rainfall 40 0 mm according to r4 that fell on august 5 7 the debris flow was monitored at 03 02 on july 9 approximately 14 5 h after the rainfall began and the front discharge was 73 4 m3 s eight surges were captured during 03 02 03 38 that is one surge approximately every 4 5 min seven minutes later at 03 45 the ninth surge discharge was monitored to be 632 9 m3 s this was followed by the 10th surge which had a discharge of 110 8 m3 s at 03 46 the 11th 13th surges which had discharges of 515 5 41 0 and 1118 4 m3 s occurred at 03 55 04 07 and 04 26 respectively subsequently there were two further large discharges which lasted over 10 min and had discharges of 445 6 and 534 5 m3 s this event did not represent a normal hydrological process because the debris flow discharges up to 1118 4 m3 s were much higher than the upper limit estimates no more than 120 m3 s in this case which indicates the occurrence of a blockage breaking effect in the source regions although it was not monitored in situ it seems that there was a time lag for runoff accumulation and that this time generally exceeded 7 min and up to 24 min which suggests that failures of either landslides or tributary debris flows blocked the channels before such accumulation in this case the failures did not require high intensity rainfall because of the abundant antecedent rainfall condition assuming fresh blockage bodies are sufficiently loose and prone to failure the accumulation time depends on the runoff discharge and the hydraulic infiltration process in the dam body such failures and blockage bodies in the source regions could occur intermittently several times this process controls debris flow formation which explains the appearance of the surges another case with a similar discharge profile was the 2008 7 11 event fig 11 although this occurred following a short period of intense rainfall the rainfall was concentrated from 06 22 06 50 on july 11 the rainfall at r1 and r3 20 8 and 20 5 mm respectively during the 0 5 h period before the debris flow was much higher than at r2 and r4 which indicates that the slopes of tributaries i and iii were more likely to become source areas the first debris flow surge was monitored at 06 58 with discharge of 168 1 m3 s the second surge followed 3 min later with discharge of 271 8 m3 s subsequently further surges with discharge greater than 100 m3 s appeared intermittently at intervals of 1 to several minutes and the peak discharge of 335 0 m3 s was monitored at 07 20 the intermittent surges persisted until 08 30 following which continuative flow as a tail lasted until 11 00 the recorded data show that the rainfall amount was small after 06 30 although the rainfall continued until 07 20 this is interesting because debris flow surges with high discharge continued to appear after this time this suggests that channel runoff but not rainfall was the causative factor of this debris flow therefore in this case the intense rainfall during 06 22 06 50 caused the failures that formed the initial debris flow as confirmed by both the observed time lag of approximately 30 min and the hydrological calculation results the calculated peak water discharge was 55 2 m3 s which indicates a reasonable soil concentration rate however given that the ratio ϒ was much larger than 3 3 for most of the time repeated dam failures could have been the principal reason for the subsequent surges the maximum peak discharge and numerous large discharges of greater than 200 m3 s together with the long duration of the debris flow after the end of the rainfall peak support this inference 5 1 3 events with abnormal τ and ϒ in the 2010 8 5 event fig 12 the rainfall was concentrated during 18 48 20 41 on august 4 and the rainfall recorded at r1 and r2 18 9 and 25 3 mm respectively was much higher than at the other two gauges 12 7 and 7 3 mm which suggests that the areas with greatest potential for slope failure were in tributaries i and ii the debris flow was monitored at 05 50 on august 5 its discharge was 1370 m3 s the time lag of almost 10 h was much longer than normal and the discharge was much higher than a normal water flood this suggests that failures that might have occurred during or after the rainfall event did not form debris flows immediately but instead blocked the channels this blocking was not realized at the monitoring section because water flows originated normally from the other tributaries in jjg however the blockage body eventually outburst and formed a huge debris flow at 05 50 on august 5 the sole intermittent surge and the following continuative flow suggest that the entire body burst in one instant the rainfall during the period 18 48 20 41 in tributaries i and ii induced blocking dam formation via landslides in the upper stream tributaries and the constant upstream flow after the end of the rainfall was the direct trigger of dam breaking and debris flow formation in the main channel 5 1 4 multiple debris flows in one long duration rainfall event sometimes multiple debris flows occur during a single rainfall event which highlights the diversity of debris flow formation types in this watershed these events are actually combinations of the three types described above for instance the rainfall event of july 23 25 2007 fig 13 triggered three debris flow events that comprised 24 98 and 62 separate surges the first rainfall peak with an average amount of 11 8 mm was distributed uniformly across the watershed during 03 15 05 30 and the first debris flow event occurred at 06 30 on july 24 approximately 1 7 h after the peak 10 min rainfall the initial several surge discharges were small that is 2 0 9 5 m3 s however the peak discharge of 272 7 m3 s that appeared at 07 34 the fourteenth surge indicated the breaking of a small blockage body the second debris flow event was monitored at 03 53 on july 25 approximately 1 3 h after the rainfall peak the initial several discharges were large greater than200 m3 s and the peak discharge was 1358 3 m3 s the third event was monitored at 14 24 on july 25 approximately 0 4 h after the rainfall peak although this lag was reasonably short the first discharge of 2262 5 m3 s and the following surges with relatively large discharges indicated that repeated breaking of blockages was the mechanism of debris flow formation another event occurred on august 3 5 2008 fig 14 the rainfall began at 00 18 am on august 3 but with very low intensity observed at all four rain gauges the first peak appeared at 04 40 at r2 with 18 6 mm of rainfall in the following 1 2 h to 05 58 the rainfall amount at r2 was much higher than at the other three gauges which recorded values no greater than 8 0 mm this suggests the first small debris flow which was monitored at 04 50 and comprised five surges with peak discharge of 21 4 m3 s was induced by the rainfall in tributary ii during 04 40 5 58 this is representative of a normal hydrological condition in that both the time lag and the peak discharge were reasonable the second debris flow was monitored approximately 15 h after the first ended that is at 22 35 on august 3 from fig 14 it can be seen that the first surge was monitored approximately 1 3 h after the rainfall peak of 22 1 mm during 20 50 21 38 the time lag was estimated at 1 3 h according to the 10 min rainfall process the discharge of the first six surges was small that is no more than 132 9 m3 s however the seventh surge with discharge of 347 3 m3 s was indicative of dam blocking this debris flow lasted for 3 4 h and comprised 12 surges it was most likely to have originated following the rainfall in tributary iii because of the higher volume in this tributary compared with the others the third rainfall peak was recorded at r1 and r2 with rainfall of 11 2 and 8 0 mm respectively during 14 10 15 20 on august 4 which suggests that the debris flow was initiated by the rainfall in tributary i the debris flow was monitored 56 min later the peak discharge was 437 0 m3 s and it occurred at 16 27 that is approximately 2 h after the rainfall peak this indicates that the runoff accumulation took some time to break the dam and increase the discharge this debris flow comprises 22 surges and it persisted for 3 4 h after the peak surge the following surges were relatively small that is no greater than 25 4 m3 s therefore we inferred that the blockage body failed entirely before 16 27 and that the following surges were formed from residual soil materials the fourth debris flow occurred on august 5 approximately 20 h after the end of the third debris flow the rainfall began at 13 22 at r1 and was subsequently concentrated over r1 and r3 during a 2 h period with rainfall amounts of 13 8 and 15 0 mm respectively the debris flow was monitored approximately 44 min after the peak rainfall and except for the initial several surges the discharge of the surges was reasonably large peak discharge 896 4 m3 s which indicates the existence of the blockage breaking effect notably the blockage breaking process might not have occurred just once but could have continued repeatedly which would have resulted in the sequence of large discharges 5 2 debris flow hydrographs and formation mechanism a flow hydrograph is a natural indicator of the hydrological process because it is representative of the system s ultimate behavior a normal water flow hydrograph generally has a continuous normal distribution shape with one or multiple peaks fig 15 a however the debris flow hydrographs here present an intermittent saw tooth shape analysis of the discharge hydrographs of all 36 events in this watershed showed that the normal τ is 1 h and ϒ 3 3 the effect of the ratio ϒ is approximately equivalent to the peak discharge q max which is more directly obtained through observations in this case q max is approximately 250 m3 s and the hydrographs could be classified into three types a time lag τ is in a normal range and discharge q d is consistently below the upper limit of the debris flow capacity q m fig 15b b time lag τ is in a normal range and discharge q d is higher than the upper limit of the debris flow capacity q m fig 15c c time lag τ is longer than the normal range and discharge q d is consistently higher than the upper limit of the debris flow capacity q m fig 15d undoubtedly variation of rainfall is the first causative factor of intermittency it determines the most likely potential source regions of material for the debris flows and it not only differs spatially but also temporally the cycle of rainfall peaks could maintain the duration of a debris flow while the interval between peaks would determine the intermittency of the surges otherwise the coincident appearance of widespread high intensity rainfall over a source area could produce high volumes of sediment irrespective of the material types a debris flow acts as a normal hydrological process or presents an abnormal appearance debris flows presenting normal characteristic parameters are formed as a mixture of the normal water flood and the instantaneous soil supply derived from either intermittent slope failure and or channel failure the surges are formed because of the randomness of the slope failures even under uniform rainfall failure processes are intermittent spatially varied and of varying magnitude according to in situ experiments on a slope in the source region guo et al 2016a given that the process of source soil supply is rarely seen experiments that have revealed the randomness of the slope failure process have also indicated that it can be considered a stochastic sequence the mechanism behind this randomness is attributable both to the heterogeneity of the soil properties for example grain composition and to the uneven slope properties for example microtopography and soils on the catchment scale guo et al 2016a abnormal debris flows involve blockage breaking phenomena and do not show a water dominated characteristic the large failures that lead to channel blocking and runoff accumulation which trigger the blockage breaking effect act as the key factor in the formation of debris flow surges in the main channel these extraordinary events thus disturb and then reconstruct the underlying hydrological processes the accumulation time and outburst flow amount depend on many factors that include the amount and properties of the failure bodies failure location and local channel conditions the blockage breaking process could occur as a one off event or as a repeated sequence the randomness behind the entire process is the reason for the variation in the characteristics of the debris flows such as time hydrograph and properties within a watershed this highlights the effect of material supplies in the process of debris flow formation 5 3 rainfall conditions for debris flow formation in most cases the debris flows were triggered corresponding to a specific sudden increase in rainfall which allowed us to determine the rainfall responsible for debris flow initiation and or slope failure rainfall conditions are generally analyzed based on i d thresholds or using other models based on rainfall parameters that rely on historical data for example caine 1980 guzzetti et al 2007 2008 guo et al 2016b 2016c moreover the runoff condition for debris flow initiation in the type of catchment considered in this study is generally defined as a specific surface water runoff discharge threshold required for initiating debris flows from sediment within channels for example takahashi 1991 2007 tognacca et al 2000 gregoretti 2000 gregoretti and fontana 2008 coe et al 2008 rosatti et al 2019 considering the reasonably low runoff required for debris flow initiation in the tributaries such as the spring water shown in fig 3 this runoff threshold appears senseless in this study we analyzed the rainfall conditions required for debris flow initiation not only to propose the threshold but also to suggest coupling of the water and soil characteristics in addition to the rainfall events that triggered debris flows another 71 events with considerable rainfall amounts which occurred during 2007 2017 but did not trigger debris flows were selected for comparison purposes the selected events mainly had total rainfall amounts 20 mm and the maximum value was 90 1 mm the corresponding i d relations shown in fig 16 indicate the following 1 the total rainfall amount is not the key triggering factor that is debris flows can occur following rainfall with a total amount of 10 mm and most of the big rainfall events with abundant amounts have duration 6 h 2 the general tendency of the i d relation of all rainfall events can be expressed as a uniform relation i 15 41 d 0 67 and the tendencies of the rainfall events that either trigger or do not trigger debris flows are close l 1 and l 2 in fig 16 however debris flows did not necessarily occur during the big rainfall events with long duration instead they were more likely triggered during events that lasted no longer than 10 h for example five and eight events were triggered by rainfall lasting 1 and 2 h respectively statistics show that 31 36 86 of the rainfall events that triggered debris flows lasting 6 h 3 the rainfall conditions suitable for normal and abnormal debris flows are similar this finding indicates that big events such as landslides and shallow slope failures require similar amounts of rainfall in the various source regions the total rainfall threshold can be expressed as i 6 25 d 0 73 0 5 d 14 5 h that is as the lowest line of rainfall able to trigger debris flows shown in fig 16 based on the above analysis and the duration identification by meteorological departments china meteorological administration 2005 the rainfall can be separated into three categories 1 short duration 0 6 h with high mean intensity 2 7 35 4 mm h this type of rainfall is highly prone to triggering debris flows that is almost all the rainfall events of this type triggered debris flows except one case as shown in ellipse a in fig 16 2 medium duration 6 12 h with medium mean intensity 1 5 4 4 mm h debris flows occurred in 7 of the 16 44 events with this type of rainfall thus this rainfall type is also highly prone to triggering debris flows ellipse b in fig 16 3 long duration greater than12 h with low mean intensity 0 7 4 1 mm h although this type of event always produces a remarkable amount of rainfall max 90 1 mm min 50 9 mm and mean 56 9 mm debris flows were rarely triggered ellipse c in fig 16 6 discussion the target area in this study is well known for its active debris flows and its long term monitoring history many previous studies have investigated the characteristics of the debris flows in this area for example li et al 2003 2004 liu et al 2008 2009 as well as the rainfall conditions cui et al 2007 guo et al 2013 however none of the earlier research has investigated the debris flow formation processes and related environmental conditions research has revealed that fluid instability and roll waves of debris flows produce the separation of flow and lead to surge appearance weir 1982 ng and mei 1994 wan and wang 1994 hungr 2000 however such work has generally originated from the perspective of flow movement and focused on a mature debris flow body rather than considering formation processes at the watershed scale this work investigated the conditions of material supply in the source regions and distinguished debris flow formation processes from the hydrological perspective using two key indices τ and q which are generally used to represent the runoff yield and influx processes a semi quantitative hydrological simulation was conducted to investigate the water runoff discharge during debris flow events although the results were not validated by the hydrographs because of a lack of data on real water flow discharge which is nearly impossible to measure during debris flow events the hydrological process based framework is recommended because it provides a reference for the runoff condition for debris flows gregoretti and fontana 2008 wei et al 2018 pastorello et al 2020 the objective of this work was not to perform a detailed numerical simulation of debris flow initiation and propagation but to provide an estimation of catchment response in terms of discharge at a reference section although the formation of debris flows was presented based on a preliminary theoretical framework the length of the analyzed data series corroborates the results it was established that debris flows are potentially formed by instantaneous mixing of shallow failures or by abrupt breaking of blockages and that they present different hydrological consequences we also found that the rainfall conditions required for the formation of different types of debris flow are similar the interpretative scheme of debris flow formation processes relies on conjecture based on the corresponding relations between rainfall and flow discharge which are regarded as the input and output of a system respectively actual observations of debris flow initiation either in relation to mass failure along a sliding surface or concentrated runoff within a steep channel in the headwater regions were missing these measurements are difficult to obtain because of the harsh field conditions in the source regions for example very steep slopes high relief fractured bedrocks rockfalls and limited space for device installation in comparison with other catchments in which physical monitoring has been realized for example chalk cliffs gadria illgraben rebaixader and others berger et al 2011 mccoy et al 2012 kean et al 2013 comiti et al 2014 hürlimann et al 2014 2019 walter et al 2017 coviello et al 2019 the scale of the watershed in this study is much larger and the material sources are more diverse and distributed more randomly therefore monitoring is much more complex in future work targeted monitoring will be a primary objective using an integrated approach combining equipment such as piezometers erosion probes geophones and video cameras however it must be emphasized that even with increased monitoring of headwater regions a knowledge gap will remain between the occurrence of slope failures in the source region and the appearance of mature debris flows at the outlet including the confluence and propagation processes therefore a logical theoretical framework and some conjecture will still be required to a certain extent the time and type of debris flow initiation in the source regions present significant uncertainties that can affect the reliability of the formation process and the threshold inappropriate selection of the initiation time can result in an incorrect duration d and a consequent non significant or non representative average intensity i moreover the rainfall responsible for the occurrence of landslides and debris flows differs the different supply types affect not only the magnitude but also the propagation process of debris flows which ultimately result in the differences between normal and abnormal phenomena we admit that the identifications performed in this work relied somewhat on experience however this is difficult to avoid given the current circumstances primarily because of the difficulties associated with monitoring debris flow initiation in the headwater region given the uncertainty that exists in terms of data monitoring and data processing we have been unable to quantify the errors in our data or to verify this uncertainty nevertheless based on the known facts despite the natural inhomogeneity and randomness which play an important part in surge formation we consider our monitored data of the case studies sufficiently reliable 7 conclusions the rainfall events responsible for 36 debris flows during 2006 2017 were identified both spatially and temporally and the hydrographs of the debris flow discharge of these events were analyzed based on the relations between the debris flows and rainfall the intermittent saw tooth shaped hydrographs of the presented debris flows differ from the shape of a continuous normal distribution hydrograph of water flow discharge on the basis of the two key hydrological parameters the time lag τ between debris flow occurrence and peak rainfall and the ratio of debris flow discharge to water flow discharge ϒ the debris flows were considered as either normal or abnormal hydrological processes we suggest that normal debris flows formed when shallow slope failures mixed immediately with channel runoff whereas abnormal debris flows formed following the channel blockage breaking effect in the headwater region the rainfall threshold for debris flow initiation was proposed as i 6 25 d 0 73 0 5 d 14 5 h debris flows were related more to rainfall pattern than to rainfall amount that is most occurred within 6 h of a rainfall event with high mean intensity and short duration however the formation type process and discharge of the debris flows showed no direct relationship with rainfall amount this research elucidated the uncertainty and randomness associated with all the above processes based on the conceptual framework that a debris flow is the product of a rainfall induced hydrological process involving the supply of soil materials we determined that rainfall variation causes intermittency of the soil supply and uncertainty regarding its location and scale the modalities of the involvement of soil supply which might disturb or reorganize the hydrological process lead to the various debris flow appearances as the system outputs which are also difficult to predict this highlights the significance of soil supplies both to debris flow formation and to surge complexity credit authorship contribution statement xiaojun guo conceptualization data

5245,debris flows are among the most destructive natural processes to affect areas of mountainous terrain debris flow formation involves watershed scale processes of hydrology and material supply this study explored both processes based on long term monitoring data from the jiangjia gully in southwestern china based on hydrological simulations we found that the debris flows formed as normal or abnormal hydrological processes the former with normal time lag τ and normal peak discharge q max formed as a typical hydrological process in which slope failure material was mixed instantaneously with channel runoff conversely the latter with longer time lag τ and or abnormal discharge q max formed through blockage and outburst associated with landslides we found that the different types of debris flow required similar rainfall conditions and that the threshold could be expressed as i 6 25 d 0 73 0 5 d 14 5 h furthermore we established that rainfall pattern influences debris flow occurrence that is such events are more likely during short duration rainfall the findings of this study highlight the significance of soil supply to the process of debris flow formation via random disturbance of the normal hydrological process keywords debris flow formation process slope failure rainfall condition jiangjia gully 1 introduction debris flows which occur frequently in mountainous catchments are triggered by rainfall and are supplied with material from slope failures landslides rockfalls and fluvial sediment transport as observed around the world debris flows generally move in the form of surges for example marchi et al 2002 mccoy et al 2012 navratil et al 2013 hürlimann et al 2014 cui et al 2018 that appear as a wave like motion of high density liquid with a certain volume and shape as observed in jiangjia gully jjg a well known debris flow catchment in southwestern china each debris flow event comprises tens or hundreds of separate surges that have different discharges densities and material contents the findings of previous investigations of the spatiotemporal characteristics of surges within events wu and kang 1993 li et al 2003 2004 2008 liu et al 2008 2009 suggest that surges should develop in a system with certain underlying dynamics that might include both deterministic and stochastic components hallerberg et al 2007 many factors and mechanisms have been proposed that might operate to produce surge waves such as the structure fluid instability and roll waves of debris flows weir 1982 ng and mei 1994 wan and wang 1994 hungr 2000 such theories originate from the perspective of flow movement and ignore the formation processes however observations indicate that successive surges have different properties thus as they are likely to originate from multiple sources they cannot be described using a single flow model as illustrated by processes on individual slopes guo et al 2016a intermittent and random failures might supply materials to debris flows in a process that leads naturally to separate surges thus the formation mechanism of surges should be traced to the sources throughout a watershed although monitoring on debris flow formation in headwater regions has been undertaken recently for example marchi et al 2002 mcardell et al 2007 hürlimann et al 2014 2019 mccoy et al 2012 navratil et al 2013 comiti et al 2014 cui et al 2018 theule et al 2018 coviello et al 2019 and records of rainfall and related flows have helped reconstruct scenarios of debris flow occurrence real time formation processes have rarely been observed this is understandable considering the risks and difficulties associated with obtaining field observations during an actual debris flow event although debris flow discharge can be inferred from the rainfall and the material supplies building such a reliable calculation method requires accurate and long term monitoring of the involved parameters at an appropriate spatial scale and frequency in practice such monitoring typically encounters two great difficulties first rainfall has high spatial variability in mountainous valleys which means that a single gauge cannot reflect local rainfall events even within the confined region of a specific watershed for example nikolopoulos et al 2014 2015 guo et al 2016b 2016c cui et al 2018 second a debris flow surge is a sudden event of short duration usually lasting no longer than a few dozen seconds which makes physical monitoring of such events problematic because of these difficulties it can be hard to determine both the precise time of occurrence of a surge and the triggering rainfall which hinders investigation of the process of debris flow formation fortunately both long term records of rainfall from widely distributed gauges and observations of debris flows in jjg have made it possible to trace the related hydrological processes and material supplies of debris flow events the objective of the present study was to provide a comprehensive picture of surge formation based on 36 debris flow events to illustrate how a surge develops as material sources respond to different rainfall amounts over an entire catchment 2 study area and data source 2 1 general introduction of jjg debris flow events occur frequently in jjg approximately 10 events per year and each event comprises tens or hundreds of separate surges which makes the gully an ideal location for real time monitoring of debris flows for example davies 1986 1990 li et al 2003 2004 2008 chen et al 2005 cui et al 2005 kang et al 2006 liu et al 2008 2009 since its establishment in the 1960s the dongchuan debris flow observation and research station operated by the chinese academy of science has compiled a huge database of debris flows which includes information on more than 500 events the watershed fig 1 is located to the east of the xiaojiang fault and is characterized by intense tectonics the watershed is 48 6 km2 and about 80 of the exposed rocks are highly fractured and mildly metamorphosed debris flows always occur in the rainy season early june to late september and the average annual rainfall ranges between 400 and 1000 mm the length of the mainstream channel is 15 5 km and it comprises three sections 1 the erosion zone length 10 0 km average gradient 17 0 2 the transport zone length 1 3 km average gradient 5 1 and 3 the deposition zone length 4 2 km average gradient 3 7 cui et al 2005 from the perspective of debris flows jjg is a rather large valley in such a watershed a debris flow is not a full valley process rather every surge originates only from certain tributaries depending on the spatial distribution and activity of potential source slopes as the monitoring section is located near the station fig 1 this study focused on the areas upstream of the section currently the principal material sources are distributed mainly in menqian gully fig 1 where colluvium is distributed widely on the slopes and in the channels there are three major tributaries in menqian gully all of which have deep cut channels with unstable slopes and broken rocks and landslides in the source regions although the tributaries in the southern duozhao gully are also mantled with highly weathered rocks check dams control the formation of debris flows 2 2 data source 2 2 1 rainfall monitoring monitoring of rainfall in source areas is fundamental for predicting debris flow occurrence for this purpose 10 rain gauges have been installed in jjg of which four r1 r4 are located within or near the major source area menqian gully fig 1 these gauges measure rainfall using a 0 1 mm tipping bucket and the data are transmitted in real time via the general packet radio service debris flow monitoring in the following the term flow includes both water flow and debris flow generally water flow is difficult to monitor because of natural shifting of the riverbed and damage by frequent debris flows therefore debris flows are the monitoring objective in jjg for this study debris flow parameters were measured manually and recorded at the monitoring section fig 1 the appearance time of a debris flow front surge t 1 end time of the overall debris flow event at the monitoring section t 2 duration d f and surge number n were recorded directly the flow velocity v was determined using a stopwatch to measure the duration of the passage of the flow front through two sections within a 200 m long channel fig 2 a and flow height h and width w were estimated by experienced experts the discharge q was calculated using the expression q vh notably this v is regarded as the velocity of the debris flow body rather than the surface velocity additionally samples of the moving debris flow bodies which were collected using a volume calibrated sampling container controlled by electronic devices fig 2b were used for density ρ and volume sediment concentration cv analyses 2 2 2 data processing this study considered data acquired from all 36 debris flows that occurred between 2006 and 2017 table 1 information on one debris flow event as an illustration of the records of individual events is provided in table 2 each debris flow event comprised intermittent surges continuative flows between the surges and the tail after the end of all surges during the research period the highest and lowest numbers of surges recorded in a single event were 98 and 3 respectively each surge lasted approximately 10 s and the interval between surges ranged from tens to hundreds of seconds the flows were typical high density viscous debris flows with evident fronts and tails the density of the surge flows was generally greater than 2 0 g cm3 with high concentration of fine particles the discharge of the surges fluctuates by up to three orders of magnitude from 10 to greater than 1000 2262 5 m3 s continuative flows generally occurred between two surges or persisted for longer than 0 5 h as a tail after the surges and their discharge was always 10 m3 s the density of the continuative flow was also as high as 1 7 g cm3 and even greater than 2 0 g cm3 in some cases 3 activity of source material in the headwater regions field observations and photos shot by an unmanned aerial vehicle revealed that debris flows are potentially initiated by landslides shallow slope failures coalescing slope rills and erosion of loose slope channel materials in tributaries here menqian gully is taken as an example for introduction of source material activities fig 3 a landslides are the main source type in the headwater region of the three tributaries the mechanism via which rainfall infiltration can initiate shallow landslides is well known reid et al 1988 iverson et al 1997 2000 the landslides generally occur with heights of 30 200 m from the lowest channel to the top trailing edge on steep slopes of 35 40 fig 3b although not necessarily observed specifically head erosion caused by landslides is known to be very active because farmland above the top edge of the landslides retreats markedly each year in addition to the headwater region of the tributaries landslides are also distributed densely along the channels in the upstream region of menqian gully fig 3c the gradients vary on the slopes above the channels fig 3d the upper sections with gradients of 20 30 are covered with sparse shrubs and grass middle sections are covered by loose soils on slopes of 25 30 the shallow soils and steep gradients on the upper parts facilitate rainfall infiltration and surface runoff generation the bedrock which comprises mainly fragile phyllite is exposed on the lower sections with gradient of 35 40 the weathered rock surfaces are seriously eroded by upper runoff and the interflow stimulates translational landslides the bottom of the slopes is generally loose colluvium with a natural angle of around 30 intense channel runoff during rainstorms also plays an important role through erosion of the slope colluvium which increases slope instability and stimulates failure along the channels shallow slope residue and surface rill erosion frequently provide ubiquitous supply to the flow the slopes which are highly weathered and soil mantled are covered with deluvium comprising gravels and clay particles that is ready to fail under any circumstance fig 3e slope rill formation is largely dependent on the local hydrological response of the various hillslope materials on the high steep slopes above the talus the heads of the rills are largely exposed bedrock on steep slopes as the slopes are naturally uneven in their lower part the rills are formed by a combination of overland flow from relatively impermeable materials and lateral flow through highly permeable materials during periods of rainfall intense precipitation in upstream areas causes a firehose effect by turning slope sediments into flow that deeply incises the channel and causes lateral erosion along the rills which are predominately lined with fragile bedrock coe et al 1997 2008 griffiths et al 2004 godt and coe 2007 the materials are deposited lower on the fans and downslope in the stream valleys although the material volume of each rill is relatively small the dense distribution of the rills for example seven rills concentrated on a 200 m wide slope means that the fans combine to form a large deposit region in the channel fig 3f the tributaries also act as crucial contributors to debris flow formation in the main channel in the following a right hand small tributary with area of 0 3 km2 is taken for illustration the upper region of the tributary is covered by sparse grass on a slope of 20 25 which concentrates the overland flow during periods of rainfall the debris flow head region is a funnel shaped trough formed by head erosion related landslide failure the landslides are caused by the combination of rainfall infiltration and the lateral and incised erosion of upstream runoff fig 3g the channel is very steep and has a gradient similar to that of the slope that is 20 25 along one side of the channel small rills are densely developed on weak phyllite bedrock outcrops on the other side loose weathered clastic particles accumulated widely on the slopes these materials represent a nearly unending supply for debris flows the severe deeply incised and lateral erosion significantly aggravate the aforementioned slope failures fig 3h the formed debris flow fan has length of about 70 m which is sizable considering the relatively small area of the tributary we inferred that debris flows historically blocked the channel not only because the debris flow fan extends more than 100 m downstream in the main channel fig 3i but also because similar debris flow residues are evident on the other side of the river the debris flow source supply and formation process are rather typical of tributaries in this region that is a steep slope deep cut channel erodible slope surface and fragile exposed bedrock although debris flows in the tributaries represent part of the flows formed in the main channel the main processes differ because of the different controlling factors such as channel slope conditions in the tributaries vertical and lateral erosion are intense therefore the debris flows formed move downstream quickly in response to the straight and steep channel conditions conversely the channel blocking phenomenon which reduces the extent of vertical incision via changing the channel undulation is evident in many sections in menqian gully the formation of a landslide debris flow dam relies on the material properties such as volume velocity and composition runoff features such as discharge velocity and interactive conditions such as deflection confluence angle dal sasso et al 2014 fan et al 2014 chen et al 2019 nevertheless in upstream areas the considerable volume of the failure bodies narrow channels widths of only several meters and direct interaction represent ideal conditions for instantaneous landslide blockages in the channel fig 3c furthermore in downstream areas blockages of tributary debris flows are very obvious and serious not only in terms of their spatial distribution but also with respect to their frequency of occurrence for example five cascaded debris flow fans were found in a 1 0 km channel section several of which were closely connected fig 3j moreover the vertical stratification of the fans showed that they were not formed by a single debris flow event the failures processes of cascaded fan bodies are rather complex which means it is difficult to determine their exact breaking time and magnitude cui et al 2013 overall the source materials of debris flows are distributed spatially throughout menqian gully from the headwater region to the outlet fig 1 we estimated that the debris flow source area is 9 4 km2 accounting for around 73 of the entire area of menqian gully which can be regarded as an unlimited supplier for producing debris flows the abundant quantity of material and the diversity of supply modes result in a process of debris flow formation that is extremely sensitive to rainfall in which the water requirement in the tributaries is reasonably low it has been observed that debris flows can move at almost any time in small tributary channels even with negligible water discharge such as spring water 4 hydrological process related to debris flows 4 1 identification of rainfall responsible for debris flows as a debris flow forms from multiple sources in the tributaries and rainfall is distributed unevenly over the valley it is difficult but fundamentally important to identify the rainfall responsible for debris flow occurrence this involves determining where and at what time the flow begins this can be achieved by comparing recorded surges and rainfalls and the spatial correlation between potential material sources and rainfall distribution the initiation time influences the determination of the rainfall event responsible for the flow that is the inducing rainfall amount and triggering intensity over 10 min 30 min and 1 h which ultimately influences the analysis of rainfall thresholds and flow formation processes in fact the initiation time is seldom known with precision in most cases the triggering time is assumed as the instant at which the rainfall reaches maximum intensity iadanza et al 2016 in this case observations indicate that most occurrences 25 36 happened at rainfall intensities 5 mm h but with peaks in the tens of minutes prior to debris flow occurrence thus this peak period was taken as the rainfall period responsible for debris flow occurrence as rainfall is highly heterogeneous even gauges r1 r4 in menqian gully which are 2 km apart present spatial variations therefore the rainfall recorded at the different gauges plays different roles in flow formation generally the rainfall recorded at the four gauges presents the following features fig 4 1 rainfall is very small for example 5 mm h except for one or two gauges for example greater than10 mm h the area s neighboring the exceptional rain gauge s could be regarded as the most likely potential debris flow source and thus the data from the gauge s were taken to represent the rainfall responsible 2 rainfall is uniform for example close to 10 mm h all slopes could be considered potential source areas and therefore the arithmetic mean value was used 3 rainfall recorded by all gauges was considerable for example 15 mm h all slopes were considered the source region of debris flow initiation but the minimum value of the rain gauges was used to attempt to identify thresholds fig 4 diagrams illustrating identification of rainfall responsible for debris flows using this determination method the gauges used for a debris flow were identified as listed in table 1 rg it must be admitted that this identification is not a systematic procedure but relies on experience and on knowledge of debris flow formation processes however this is unavoidable and the error could be controlled to a certain extent through consideration of the universal regulation derived from using more than 30 events that provided actual rainfall cases with spatial differences the key point is that both the rainfall amount threshold for debris flow initiation and the time lag from peak rainfall to debris flow appearance discussed in the following can be quantified based on this temporal and spatial identification procedure based on determination of the location and initiation time of a debris flow the characteristics of the rainfall event can be estimated from the available rain gauge data the following indices are of special interest 1 inducing rainfall r i mm the cumulative rainfall from the beginning of the rainfall event to the time of debris flow occurrence 2 mean inducing rainfall intensity i mm h obtained by dividing the inducing rainfall r i by the duration from the beginning of the rainfall event to the time of debris flow occurrence d 3 triggering rainfall r t mm the direct triggering rainfall in 1 h 30 min and 10 min periods 4 antecedent rainfall ra mm the weighted sum of rainfall days prior to the occurrence of a debris flow which can be defined as cui et al 2007 guo et al 2013 2017 1 r a i 1 n r i k i where ri is the daily rainfall in the preceding n days i designates the exact number of days prior to the debris flow incident 1 i n and k is a decay coefficient of the i th day suggested values for k and n are 0 8 and 10 respectively statistical information of the rainfall is listed in table 3 among other factors inducing rainfall r i and triggering rainfall r t are the direct causes of debris flow occurrence guo et al 2016c 2017 it is evident that the value of each rainfall factor varies markedly for example the inducing rainfall amount varies from 5 1 to 58 4 mm and the triggering 10 min 30 min and 1 h rainfall varies in the ranges 1 1 15 3 3 0 27 4 and 5 1 50 8 mm respectively this indicates the difficulty of predicting debris flows based on a single parameter and reveals that the triggering condition is highly uncertain therefore the reasons for debris flow occurrence should be investigated comprehensively 4 2 hydrological calculation for water flow estimation on the watershed scale a debris flow is considered a product of a rainfall induced hydrological process involving the supply of soil material this involvement influences the flow discharge density and time of peak discharge from a hydrological perspective the discharge and time lag from peak rainfall to debris flow appearance at the monitoring section appear to take special roles in reflecting the runoff yield and flow influx processes notably shallow soil failures and rill erosions contribute primarily to frequent normal debris flows whereas a landslide debris flow dam outburst usually results in a catastrophic abnormal debris flow according to the classification of bardou and jaboyedoff 2008 a normal hydrological process is water dominated and the debris flow hydrograph comprises water and instantaneous sediment volume in an abnormal debris flow the time lag might be longer than normal and the peak discharge would be amplified considerably because of the blockage outburst as observed in many other sites cui et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 2015 in this watershed a combined rainfall runoff and routing method was used to estimate the maximum water flow because data on water flood discharges are unavailable this method has also been applied in related previous research lumbroso and gaume 2012 capra et al 2018 first the rainfall was interpolated using the thiessen polygon method and the watershed was divided into subregions based on units of slope then for each slope subregion the runoff yield was calculated based on the us soil conservation service scs curve number cn method scs 1985 mishra and singh 2003 in the scs method the volume of water runoff produced is estimated through the single parameter cn which summarizes the influence of both superficial aspects and deep soil features including the saturated hydraulic conductivity type of land use and humidity before the precipitation event we suggest that the larger the value the greater the runoff yield generally cn values are identified via a lookup table from the handbook scs 1985 the kinematic wave routine method was used to simulate the propagation and influx process of the water flow 4 3 validation of the hydrological calculation validation of the results for water flow was rather difficult because of the lack of measurements of water flood discharges in recent studies validation was performed by comparing the time of the peak of the simulated hydrograph with the time of detection of debris flow occurrence at monitoring stations at other sites lumbroso and gaume 2012 capra et al 2018 in this work the validation process not only compared the time lag τ also compared the total water flow amount time lag the time lag τ from the time of the triggering rainfall to debris flow appearance at the monitoring section is a principal index that represents the propagation process after identification of the rainfall responsible for a debris flow the time lag τ can be analyzed through comparison of the rainfall and surge hydrograph the results indicate that time lag τ generally falls within the range of 30 min to 1 1 h average 50 min table 1 depending on the material supply and flow influx processes this lag is therefore considered a key parameter for distinguishing normal and abnormal events for normal cases we inferred that the peak rainfall period is within 1 h of debris flow appearance however in some abnormal cases the lag is much longer as listed in table 1 for example the 2010 8 5 debris flow captured at the monitoring section at 05 51 all times given are local time occurred 10 5 h after the peak rainfall and even 10 h after the rain stopped which indicates that the debris flow was not an instant response to the rainfall the hydrological simulation is unsuitable under such circumstances therefore the simulation and validation of water flow were performed only for events with a normal time lag that is 1h total water flow volume because the debris flow surges rather than the real water flow hydrographs were measured directly the calculation of the total water amount should be explained as shown in the generalized sketch fig 5 a a monitored debris flow hydrograph comprises several discontinuous surges together with continuative flows between the surges and continuative flows appear as tails after the surges have ended for continuative flows between two surges that were not completely recorded we assumed that they had discharge qd and cv values similar to those of the first continuative flow after all surges had ended the total volume of a surge is simplified as a triangle shape because the discharges of the debris flow front and tail are different whereas a continuative flow is relatively steady and can be simplified as a rectangle shape for volume calculation as a debris flow is a mixture of water and soil the water flow discharge q w of each surge can be estimated based on the debris flow discharge q d using eq 2 2 q w q d 1 c v and the total amount is the integral sum of the surges and the following continuative flows considering both the uncertainty in monitoring and the assumptions in the data processing of the total water flow amount an acceptable error range of 20 20 was adopted as shown in fig 6 a the simulation errors are in the range of 15 6 17 7 with an average value of 7 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is 93 and the correlation coefficient is 96 meanwhile the debris flow occurrence time corresponds to the peak water discharge period fig 6b the validation of flow propagation time and total flow amount verified the parameters used in the hydrological calculation which allowed the simulation s acceptable accuracy and provided a method with which to assess any obvious abnormal relation between water flow discharge and debris flow discharge 4 4 criterion for discriminating normal from abnormal events the real ratio of debris flow discharge to water flow discharge is generally under the upper limit value of 3 3 considering that the measured cv is in the range 0 514 0 767 however the conditions of the ratio ϒ between the debris flow discharges and calculated water flow discharges differed this can help to distinguish normal from abnormal events for instance the 2013 6 7 event was used as a case study to illustrate this ratio fig 7 it was selected because it had the highest event rainfall 77 0 mm and 1 h rainfall intensity 50 8 mm h of all the studied events as recorded at r2 moreover it also had considerable antecedent rainfall of 34 4 mm during the 10 d period prior to the event date the actual value used to represent the real runoff yield condition for peak discharge was approximately 90 m3 s the simulated peak flow time was 03 30 04 00 and the first debris flow surge was monitored at 03 45 additionally we also used for reference a value of cn 90 for the entire watershed which is very high and almost impossible to achieve especially for the high permeability of the loose material of the soil surface in the source region the result indicates that the upper limit of runoff discharge in this watershed fig 7 was no greater than 120 m3 s in this case the potential maximum value of debris flow discharge is in the range of 360 480 m3 s based on eq 2 the ratio ϒ is regarded as normal because the monitored debris flow discharge was 357 m3 s in some cases the upper limit of the simulated water flow peak discharge was much smaller than the monitored debris flow discharges for instance the simulated maximum q w of the 2007 7 25 event was 53 8 m3 s and the monitored cv at the simulated peak water flood period was in the range of 0 72 0 75 which indicates that the debris flow discharge q d was in the range of 192 1 215 2 m3 s additionally the potential maximum water flow cn 90 was 66 4 m3 s which indicates a debris flow discharge q d with an upper limit of 265 6 m3 s however the monitored peak discharge of q max 2263 m3 s is much higher than this value in this circumstance the relation is considered abnormal because it does not reflect a normal hydrological process instead it represents the outburst of blockage bodies in the upper steam which significantly amplify the discharge the ratio ϒ of more than 50 of debris flows was greater than 3 3 fig 8 the maximum ϒ was 15 6 which indicates a significant amplification effect 5 possible processes of debris flow formation in this section the hydrographs of some typical debris flow cases are taken as examples with which to explain the hypothesis and the rainfall conditions required are analyzed to indicate the formation processes 5 1 typical cases analysis 5 1 1 events with normal τ and ϒ as shown in fig 9 the rainfall in the 2009 8 4 event was concentrated between 04 30 and 05 45 and the debris flow appeared at the monitoring section at 05 24 at the beginning of the event the rainfall peak started at r1 with a peak amount of 13 3 mm in 15 min 04 32 04 46 this was followed shortly by a burst of rainfall at r4 04 38 04 57 with a peak amount of 18 3 mm although the rainfall recorded at r3 was smaller than at r1 and r4 the peak lasted longer until 05 05 with 18 5 mm recorded in the previous 30 min the rainfall values recorded were all sufficient to induce debris flows according to historical records guo et al 2013 therefore it is difficult to identify the exact time and location of the debris flow initiated during 04 30 05 00 however by comparing the rainfall and debris flow processes the time lag was identified as 36 54 min the rainfall continued over the gully therefore all the tributaries might have been activated to supply materials even within the short peak period of 30 min the alternate peaks in the different tributaries might have expanded the region of debris flow initiation and extended the period of slope failure which potentially increased the number of surges and the duration of the debris flow the mean discharge of this debris flow was 60 6 m3 s with a peak of 194 8 m3 s the debris flow surges persisted until 06 18 although the flow after this time was still a type of debris flow it was more representative of a tail that behaved as a continuative flow with a much smaller discharge the hydrological simulation shows that the peak period of water flow discharge concurred with debris flow occurrence with a peak value of 64 3 m3 s the ratio ϒ was in the range of 1 3 which is reasonable for a normal water soil mixture the debris flow formation processes in the source region were not observed in situ however it can be inferred that slope failures occurred continuously in all tributaries and that the material became intermittently mixed with the water flood 5 1 2 events with a normal τ and abnormal ϒ the 2008 8 8 debris flow event fig 10 accompanied rainfall of long duration 32 h and low intensity 6 mm h at each rain gauge however it followed a considerable amount of antecedent rainfall 40 0 mm according to r4 that fell on august 5 7 the debris flow was monitored at 03 02 on july 9 approximately 14 5 h after the rainfall began and the front discharge was 73 4 m3 s eight surges were captured during 03 02 03 38 that is one surge approximately every 4 5 min seven minutes later at 03 45 the ninth surge discharge was monitored to be 632 9 m3 s this was followed by the 10th surge which had a discharge of 110 8 m3 s at 03 46 the 11th 13th surges which had discharges of 515 5 41 0 and 1118 4 m3 s occurred at 03 55 04 07 and 04 26 respectively subsequently there were two further large discharges which lasted over 10 min and had discharges of 445 6 and 534 5 m3 s this event did not represent a normal hydrological process because the debris flow discharges up to 1118 4 m3 s were much higher than the upper limit estimates no more than 120 m3 s in this case which indicates the occurrence of a blockage breaking effect in the source regions although it was not monitored in situ it seems that there was a time lag for runoff accumulation and that this time generally exceeded 7 min and up to 24 min which suggests that failures of either landslides or tributary debris flows blocked the channels before such accumulation in this case the failures did not require high intensity rainfall because of the abundant antecedent rainfall condition assuming fresh blockage bodies are sufficiently loose and prone to failure the accumulation time depends on the runoff discharge and the hydraulic infiltration process in the dam body such failures and blockage bodies in the source regions could occur intermittently several times this process controls debris flow formation which explains the appearance of the surges another case with a similar discharge profile was the 2008 7 11 event fig 11 although this occurred following a short period of intense rainfall the rainfall was concentrated from 06 22 06 50 on july 11 the rainfall at r1 and r3 20 8 and 20 5 mm respectively during the 0 5 h period before the debris flow was much higher than at r2 and r4 which indicates that the slopes of tributaries i and iii were more likely to become source areas the first debris flow surge was monitored at 06 58 with discharge of 168 1 m3 s the second surge followed 3 min later with discharge of 271 8 m3 s subsequently further surges with discharge greater than 100 m3 s appeared intermittently at intervals of 1 to several minutes and the peak discharge of 335 0 m3 s was monitored at 07 20 the intermittent surges persisted until 08 30 following which continuative flow as a tail lasted until 11 00 the recorded data show that the rainfall amount was small after 06 30 although the rainfall continued until 07 20 this is interesting because debris flow surges with high discharge continued to appear after this time this suggests that channel runoff but not rainfall was the causative factor of this debris flow therefore in this case the intense rainfall during 06 22 06 50 caused the failures that formed the initial debris flow as confirmed by both the observed time lag of approximately 30 min and the hydrological calculation results the calculated peak water discharge was 55 2 m3 s which indicates a reasonable soil concentration rate however given that the ratio ϒ was much larger than 3 3 for most of the time repeated dam failures could have been the principal reason for the subsequent surges the maximum peak discharge and numerous large discharges of greater than 200 m3 s together with the long duration of the debris flow after the end of the rainfall peak support this inference 5 1 3 events with abnormal τ and ϒ in the 2010 8 5 event fig 12 the rainfall was concentrated during 18 48 20 41 on august 4 and the rainfall recorded at r1 and r2 18 9 and 25 3 mm respectively was much higher than at the other two gauges 12 7 and 7 3 mm which suggests that the areas with greatest potential for slope failure were in tributaries i and ii the debris flow was monitored at 05 50 on august 5 its discharge was 1370 m3 s the time lag of almost 10 h was much longer than normal and the discharge was much higher than a normal water flood this suggests that failures that might have occurred during or after the rainfall event did not form debris flows immediately but instead blocked the channels this blocking was not realized at the monitoring section because water flows originated normally from the other tributaries in jjg however the blockage body eventually outburst and formed a huge debris flow at 05 50 on august 5 the sole intermittent surge and the following continuative flow suggest that the entire body burst in one instant the rainfall during the period 18 48 20 41 in tributaries i and ii induced blocking dam formation via landslides in the upper stream tributaries and the constant upstream flow after the end of the rainfall was the direct trigger of dam breaking and debris flow formation in the main channel 5 1 4 multiple debris flows in one long duration rainfall event sometimes multiple debris flows occur during a single rainfall event which highlights the diversity of debris flow formation types in this watershed these events are actually combinations of the three types described above for instance the rainfall event of july 23 25 2007 fig 13 triggered three debris flow events that comprised 24 98 and 62 separate surges the first rainfall peak with an average amount of 11 8 mm was distributed uniformly across the watershed during 03 15 05 30 and the first debris flow event occurred at 06 30 on july 24 approximately 1 7 h after the peak 10 min rainfall the initial several surge discharges were small that is 2 0 9 5 m3 s however the peak discharge of 272 7 m3 s that appeared at 07 34 the fourteenth surge indicated the breaking of a small blockage body the second debris flow event was monitored at 03 53 on july 25 approximately 1 3 h after the rainfall peak the initial several discharges were large greater than200 m3 s and the peak discharge was 1358 3 m3 s the third event was monitored at 14 24 on july 25 approximately 0 4 h after the rainfall peak although this lag was reasonably short the first discharge of 2262 5 m3 s and the following surges with relatively large discharges indicated that repeated breaking of blockages was the mechanism of debris flow formation another event occurred on august 3 5 2008 fig 14 the rainfall began at 00 18 am on august 3 but with very low intensity observed at all four rain gauges the first peak appeared at 04 40 at r2 with 18 6 mm of rainfall in the following 1 2 h to 05 58 the rainfall amount at r2 was much higher than at the other three gauges which recorded values no greater than 8 0 mm this suggests the first small debris flow which was monitored at 04 50 and comprised five surges with peak discharge of 21 4 m3 s was induced by the rainfall in tributary ii during 04 40 5 58 this is representative of a normal hydrological condition in that both the time lag and the peak discharge were reasonable the second debris flow was monitored approximately 15 h after the first ended that is at 22 35 on august 3 from fig 14 it can be seen that the first surge was monitored approximately 1 3 h after the rainfall peak of 22 1 mm during 20 50 21 38 the time lag was estimated at 1 3 h according to the 10 min rainfall process the discharge of the first six surges was small that is no more than 132 9 m3 s however the seventh surge with discharge of 347 3 m3 s was indicative of dam blocking this debris flow lasted for 3 4 h and comprised 12 surges it was most likely to have originated following the rainfall in tributary iii because of the higher volume in this tributary compared with the others the third rainfall peak was recorded at r1 and r2 with rainfall of 11 2 and 8 0 mm respectively during 14 10 15 20 on august 4 which suggests that the debris flow was initiated by the rainfall in tributary i the debris flow was monitored 56 min later the peak discharge was 437 0 m3 s and it occurred at 16 27 that is approximately 2 h after the rainfall peak this indicates that the runoff accumulation took some time to break the dam and increase the discharge this debris flow comprises 22 surges and it persisted for 3 4 h after the peak surge the following surges were relatively small that is no greater than 25 4 m3 s therefore we inferred that the blockage body failed entirely before 16 27 and that the following surges were formed from residual soil materials the fourth debris flow occurred on august 5 approximately 20 h after the end of the third debris flow the rainfall began at 13 22 at r1 and was subsequently concentrated over r1 and r3 during a 2 h period with rainfall amounts of 13 8 and 15 0 mm respectively the debris flow was monitored approximately 44 min after the peak rainfall and except for the initial several surges the discharge of the surges was reasonably large peak discharge 896 4 m3 s which indicates the existence of the blockage breaking effect notably the blockage breaking process might not have occurred just once but could have continued repeatedly which would have resulted in the sequence of large discharges 5 2 debris flow hydrographs and formation mechanism a flow hydrograph is a natural indicator of the hydrological process because it is representative of the system s ultimate behavior a normal water flow hydrograph generally has a continuous normal distribution shape with one or multiple peaks fig 15 a however the debris flow hydrographs here present an intermittent saw tooth shape analysis of the discharge hydrographs of all 36 events in this watershed showed that the normal τ is 1 h and ϒ 3 3 the effect of the ratio ϒ is approximately equivalent to the peak discharge q max which is more directly obtained through observations in this case q max is approximately 250 m3 s and the hydrographs could be classified into three types a time lag τ is in a normal range and discharge q d is consistently below the upper limit of the debris flow capacity q m fig 15b b time lag τ is in a normal range and discharge q d is higher than the upper limit of the debris flow capacity q m fig 15c c time lag τ is longer than the normal range and discharge q d is consistently higher than the upper limit of the debris flow capacity q m fig 15d undoubtedly variation of rainfall is the first causative factor of intermittency it determines the most likely potential source regions of material for the debris flows and it not only differs spatially but also temporally the cycle of rainfall peaks could maintain the duration of a debris flow while the interval between peaks would determine the intermittency of the surges otherwise the coincident appearance of widespread high intensity rainfall over a source area could produce high volumes of sediment irrespective of the material types a debris flow acts as a normal hydrological process or presents an abnormal appearance debris flows presenting normal characteristic parameters are formed as a mixture of the normal water flood and the instantaneous soil supply derived from either intermittent slope failure and or channel failure the surges are formed because of the randomness of the slope failures even under uniform rainfall failure processes are intermittent spatially varied and of varying magnitude according to in situ experiments on a slope in the source region guo et al 2016a given that the process of source soil supply is rarely seen experiments that have revealed the randomness of the slope failure process have also indicated that it can be considered a stochastic sequence the mechanism behind this randomness is attributable both to the heterogeneity of the soil properties for example grain composition and to the uneven slope properties for example microtopography and soils on the catchment scale guo et al 2016a abnormal debris flows involve blockage breaking phenomena and do not show a water dominated characteristic the large failures that lead to channel blocking and runoff accumulation which trigger the blockage breaking effect act as the key factor in the formation of debris flow surges in the main channel these extraordinary events thus disturb and then reconstruct the underlying hydrological processes the accumulation time and outburst flow amount depend on many factors that include the amount and properties of the failure bodies failure location and local channel conditions the blockage breaking process could occur as a one off event or as a repeated sequence the randomness behind the entire process is the reason for the variation in the characteristics of the debris flows such as time hydrograph and properties within a watershed this highlights the effect of material supplies in the process of debris flow formation 5 3 rainfall conditions for debris flow formation in most cases the debris flows were triggered corresponding to a specific sudden increase in rainfall which allowed us to determine the rainfall responsible for debris flow initiation and or slope failure rainfall conditions are generally analyzed based on i d thresholds or using other models based on rainfall parameters that rely on historical data for example caine 1980 guzzetti et al 2007 2008 guo et al 2016b 2016c moreover the runoff condition for debris flow initiation in the type of catchment considered in this study is generally defined as a specific surface water runoff discharge threshold required for initiating debris flows from sediment within channels for example takahashi 1991 2007 tognacca et al 2000 gregoretti 2000 gregoretti and fontana 2008 coe et al 2008 rosatti et al 2019 considering the reasonably low runoff required for debris flow initiation in the tributaries such as the spring water shown in fig 3 this runoff threshold appears senseless in this study we analyzed the rainfall conditions required for debris flow initiation not only to propose the threshold but also to suggest coupling of the water and soil characteristics in addition to the rainfall events that triggered debris flows another 71 events with considerable rainfall amounts which occurred during 2007 2017 but did not trigger debris flows were selected for comparison purposes the selected events mainly had total rainfall amounts 20 mm and the maximum value was 90 1 mm the corresponding i d relations shown in fig 16 indicate the following 1 the total rainfall amount is not the key triggering factor that is debris flows can occur following rainfall with a total amount of 10 mm and most of the big rainfall events with abundant amounts have duration 6 h 2 the general tendency of the i d relation of all rainfall events can be expressed as a uniform relation i 15 41 d 0 67 and the tendencies of the rainfall events that either trigger or do not trigger debris flows are close l 1 and l 2 in fig 16 however debris flows did not necessarily occur during the big rainfall events with long duration instead they were more likely triggered during events that lasted no longer than 10 h for example five and eight events were triggered by rainfall lasting 1 and 2 h respectively statistics show that 31 36 86 of the rainfall events that triggered debris flows lasting 6 h 3 the rainfall conditions suitable for normal and abnormal debris flows are similar this finding indicates that big events such as landslides and shallow slope failures require similar amounts of rainfall in the various source regions the total rainfall threshold can be expressed as i 6 25 d 0 73 0 5 d 14 5 h that is as the lowest line of rainfall able to trigger debris flows shown in fig 16 based on the above analysis and the duration identification by meteorological departments china meteorological administration 2005 the rainfall can be separated into three categories 1 short duration 0 6 h with high mean intensity 2 7 35 4 mm h this type of rainfall is highly prone to triggering debris flows that is almost all the rainfall events of this type triggered debris flows except one case as shown in ellipse a in fig 16 2 medium duration 6 12 h with medium mean intensity 1 5 4 4 mm h debris flows occurred in 7 of the 16 44 events with this type of rainfall thus this rainfall type is also highly prone to triggering debris flows ellipse b in fig 16 3 long duration greater than12 h with low mean intensity 0 7 4 1 mm h although this type of event always produces a remarkable amount of rainfall max 90 1 mm min 50 9 mm and mean 56 9 mm debris flows were rarely triggered ellipse c in fig 16 6 discussion the target area in this study is well known for its active debris flows and its long term monitoring history many previous studies have investigated the characteristics of the debris flows in this area for example li et al 2003 2004 liu et al 2008 2009 as well as the rainfall conditions cui et al 2007 guo et al 2013 however none of the earlier research has investigated the debris flow formation processes and related environmental conditions research has revealed that fluid instability and roll waves of debris flows produce the separation of flow and lead to surge appearance weir 1982 ng and mei 1994 wan and wang 1994 hungr 2000 however such work has generally originated from the perspective of flow movement and focused on a mature debris flow body rather than considering formation processes at the watershed scale this work investigated the conditions of material supply in the source regions and distinguished debris flow formation processes from the hydrological perspective using two key indices τ and q which are generally used to represent the runoff yield and influx processes a semi quantitative hydrological simulation was conducted to investigate the water runoff discharge during debris flow events although the results were not validated by the hydrographs because of a lack of data on real water flow discharge which is nearly impossible to measure during debris flow events the hydrological process based framework is recommended because it provides a reference for the runoff condition for debris flows gregoretti and fontana 2008 wei et al 2018 pastorello et al 2020 the objective of this work was not to perform a detailed numerical simulation of debris flow initiation and propagation but to provide an estimation of catchment response in terms of discharge at a reference section although the formation of debris flows was presented based on a preliminary theoretical framework the length of the analyzed data series corroborates the results it was established that debris flows are potentially formed by instantaneous mixing of shallow failures or by abrupt breaking of blockages and that they present different hydrological consequences we also found that the rainfall conditions required for the formation of different types of debris flow are similar the interpretative scheme of debris flow formation processes relies on conjecture based on the corresponding relations between rainfall and flow discharge which are regarded as the input and output of a system respectively actual observations of debris flow initiation either in relation to mass failure along a sliding surface or concentrated runoff within a steep channel in the headwater regions were missing these measurements are difficult to obtain because of the harsh field conditions in the source regions for example very steep slopes high relief fractured bedrocks rockfalls and limited space for device installation in comparison with other catchments in which physical monitoring has been realized for example chalk cliffs gadria illgraben rebaixader and others berger et al 2011 mccoy et al 2012 kean et al 2013 comiti et al 2014 hürlimann et al 2014 2019 walter et al 2017 coviello et al 2019 the scale of the watershed in this study is much larger and the material sources are more diverse and distributed more randomly therefore monitoring is much more complex in future work targeted monitoring will be a primary objective using an integrated approach combining equipment such as piezometers erosion probes geophones and video cameras however it must be emphasized that even with increased monitoring of headwater regions a knowledge gap will remain between the occurrence of slope failures in the source region and the appearance of mature debris flows at the outlet including the confluence and propagation processes therefore a logical theoretical framework and some conjecture will still be required to a certain extent the time and type of debris flow initiation in the source regions present significant uncertainties that can affect the reliability of the formation process and the threshold inappropriate selection of the initiation time can result in an incorrect duration d and a consequent non significant or non representative average intensity i moreover the rainfall responsible for the occurrence of landslides and debris flows differs the different supply types affect not only the magnitude but also the propagation process of debris flows which ultimately result in the differences between normal and abnormal phenomena we admit that the identifications performed in this work relied somewhat on experience however this is difficult to avoid given the current circumstances primarily because of the difficulties associated with monitoring debris flow initiation in the headwater region given the uncertainty that exists in terms of data monitoring and data processing we have been unable to quantify the errors in our data or to verify this uncertainty nevertheless based on the known facts despite the natural inhomogeneity and randomness which play an important part in surge formation we consider our monitored data of the case studies sufficiently reliable 7 conclusions the rainfall events responsible for 36 debris flows during 2006 2017 were identified both spatially and temporally and the hydrographs of the debris flow discharge of these events were analyzed based on the relations between the debris flows and rainfall the intermittent saw tooth shaped hydrographs of the presented debris flows differ from the shape of a continuous normal distribution hydrograph of water flow discharge on the basis of the two key hydrological parameters the time lag τ between debris flow occurrence and peak rainfall and the ratio of debris flow discharge to water flow discharge ϒ the debris flows were considered as either normal or abnormal hydrological processes we suggest that normal debris flows formed when shallow slope failures mixed immediately with channel runoff whereas abnormal debris flows formed following the channel blockage breaking effect in the headwater region the rainfall threshold for debris flow initiation was proposed as i 6 25 d 0 73 0 5 d 14 5 h debris flows were related more to rainfall pattern than to rainfall amount that is most occurred within 6 h of a rainfall event with high mean intensity and short duration however the formation type process and discharge of the debris flows showed no direct relationship with rainfall amount this research elucidated the uncertainty and randomness associated with all the above processes based on the conceptual framework that a debris flow is the product of a rainfall induced hydrological process involving the supply of soil materials we determined that rainfall variation causes intermittency of the soil supply and uncertainty regarding its location and scale the modalities of the involvement of soil supply which might disturb or reorganize the hydrological process lead to the various debris flow appearances as the system outputs which are also difficult to predict this highlights the significance of soil supplies both to debris flow formation and to surge complexity credit authorship contribution statement xiaojun guo conceptualization data

5246,a region of influence approach in which statistical depth functions are used to select gauged catchments having similar flood generation behaviour to a given ungauged basin coupled with nonparametric regression on catchment characteristics is employed to estimate mean annual and a quantile flood of 100 year return period in new zealand basins this approach may be applied internationally relative and root mean square errors assessed by jack knife resampling are too large to be useful for detailed design in ungauged catchments but are much smaller than those resulting from a conventional multiple nonlinear regression approach the distribution of errors for samples of sites indicates that large error values result from contributions from a relatively small number of statistical outliers although these are all natural catchments the outlier basins have particular physical characteristics such as moraines karst features and pumice sediments which affect their flood generation processes relative errors in estimates for an ungauged basin may be predicted using a relationship involving differences in area rainfall and statistical depth between the ungauged catchment and gauged similar catchments improved analytical techniques and selection and measurement of catchment characteristics should reduce error magnitude but not perhaps sufficiently for use in detailed design parallel development based on rainfall runoff models is desirable but the present lack of requisite information largely concerning rainfalls means that attainment of desired accuracy is a distant prospect keywords regional flood frequency depth function index flood method flood estimation 1 introduction the dominant characteristic of new zealand hydrology is diversity about half the country is mountainous the remainder is hilly or composed of extensive alluvial fans particularly in the south island there is a mosaic of landscape types many with sharp relief and deep dissection annual rainfalls vary from less than a metre to over 14 m griffiths and mcsaveney 1983 the country is comparatively young geologically extensive glaciation has occurred in the south island and the north island has many volcanoes whose associated deposits particularly pumice significantly affect catchment storage nearly half the vegetation is grassland and much of the rest is forest and scrub flooding is the most significant natural hazard on a generational scale affecting many communities and transport links considerable investment has occurred in the design and construction of flood protection works and floodplain management schemes largely for urban areas the design of these elements which is often technically difficult usually involves estimation of flood peak magnitude and return period flood volume flood duration and flood translation time owing to the availability of a substantial amount of flood peak information from catchment hydrological recording stations or sites a desire to capitalise further on that information and the need for flood peak prediction at numerous sites nationally a regional statistical flood frequency approach is adopted herein an alternative deterministic approach based on for example nationwide rainfall runoff modelling where return periods are linked to return periods of flood generating rainfalls would be too demanding of presently available resources moreover extreme value frequency analysis is still normally required for predictions involving large return periods asadi et al 2018 as the nature of this study is operational rather than an exploration of new methods we employ the most common method of regional flood frequency analysis of defining homogenous regions and undertaking regional analysis within them to predict flood peak size of given return period at an ungauged site using data from gauged sites specifically we employ the regional flood method dalrymple 1960 hosking and wallis 1997 where the index is taken as the mean annual flood q m the mean of a record of annual maximum flood peak discharges q at a site and site growth curves are defined by q q m versus t where t is the return period in new zealand the first national study of flood frequency was undertaken by beable and mckerchar 1982 the index flood method was employed and q m was expressed as a function of catchment area a and one or two rainfall parameters in each of nine separate homogeneous regions which tended to correspond to lithologic and climatic regions extreme value type i ev1 and type ii ev2 distributions were fitted by the method of maximum likelihood to annual maxima including some historic peaks from 152 sites located throughout the country to define growth curves in eight separate homogeneous regions which tended to correspond to climatic regions mckerchar and pearson 1989 also adopted an index flood approach and presented national contour maps of a form of specific mean annual flood discharge q m a 0 8 in which a is catchment area and of a regional frequency factor q 100 q m where q 100 is the flood peak for t 100 yr some 324 sites were used in contouring specific flood discharge and 275 for the regional frequency factor estimated by fitting ev1 distributions using probability weighted moments no historic data were included an analysis of performance using independent sites was not undertaken by beable and mckerchar 1982 or mckerchar and pearson 1989 1990 in this study we also adopt the index flood approach but as an alternative to fixed boundary regions we employ non contiguous homogeneous regions composed of gauged catchments having similar hydrological behaviour particularly as concerns flood generation to an ungauged or target site these sets of similar catchments or basins are also variously described in the literature as pooling groups or hydrological neighbourhoods two main methods of analysis are used namely region of influence roi acreman and wiltshire 1989 burn 1990 and canonical correlation analysis cca ouarda et al 2001 and it has been shown by for instance ouarda et al 2001 and haddad et al 2015 that these methods can improve upon fixed region approaches determination of a group of similar catchments involves use of a similarity measure between the ungauged site and the gauged ones for example weighted euclidean distance burn 1990 gaal et al 2008 within a space defined by physiographic climate and hydrological pch variables or the mahalanobis distance also defined by the pch variables both these methods have drawbacks concerning robustness against outliers affine invariance and require normality of site characteristics instead following the work done by chebana and ouarda 2008 we use depth functions tukey 1975 to select similar catchments within a space defined by pch variables as they appear to outperform the above approaches chebana and ouarda 2008 wazneh et al 2016 nonparametric regression techniques are then used on pch data from the similar catchments to estimate q m at the target site values of a quantile flood q100 are then determined as for qm the single quantile was selected to allow general comparison with earlier work by beable and mckerchar 1982 mckerchar and pearson 1990 mckerchar 1991 and griffiths and mckerchar 2012 and because there are relatively few sites with long records median record length for all sites is 18 years see also chebana and ouarda 2008 moreover most flood protection design in new zealand is employs flood peak estimation for q100 and our focus is on presenting an alternative approach specifically the aim of the study is to present a variation to a standard method of flood frequency analysis and use it to estimate flood peak magnitudes of given return period in new zealand 2 methods in applying the index flood method the most difficult step involves the definition of homogeneous regions consisting in this study of pooling groups of similar catchments with gauged sites having similar flood generation characteristics or attributes to a nominated ungauged site this step is as crucial to the performance of the method as it is complex once a set of similar catchments has been selected estimation of qm and q100 is an easier task which can be readily completed using well established techniques we now describe the various steps involved in our approach including methods used to assess its performance as applied in new zealand 2 1 selection of similar catchments 2 1 1 depth function data depth is a quantitative measurement of how central a point is with respect to a multivariate data cloud or a probability distribution it gives a central outward ordering of multivariate data points and yields simple new ways to quantify complex multivariate features of the underlying multivariate distribution li et al 2012 liu et al 1999 the first depth function was introduced by tukey 1975 to identify the centre a generalized median of a multivariate dataset generalizations of this concept have been defined by barnett 1976 liu et al 2006 zuo and serfling 2000 data depth functions have been applied in several fields of non parametric multivariate analysis andrew et al 2000 hamurkaroglu et al 2006 liu 1995 liu and singh 1993 messaoud et al 2004 serfling 2002 stoumbos et al 2001 li et al 2012 application of the data depth function is relatively new in the field of water resources it has been used in the field of regional flood frequency analysis chebana and ouarda 2008 wazneh et al 2013a b 2015 depth based multivariate descriptive statistics

defining soil moisture dynamics based on a crtical event wang et al 2019 for further details about the data depth function and its uses in the field of water resources see chebana and ouarda 2011a chebana and ouarda 2011c guerrero et al 2013 krauße and cullmann 2009 chebana and ouarda 2008 and singh and bárdossy 2012 several types of data depth functions have been developed for instance half space projection l1 simplicial volume and mahalanobis depth functions the most important properties of a depth function are i affine invariance ii maximality at center iii monotonicity related to the deepest point and iv vanishing at infinity these properties fit the constraints of regional flood frequency analysis chebana and ouarda 2008 the half space depth function tukey 1975 was used in this study because it satisfies all the properties of a depth function is easy to calculate and is robust singh et al 2016 also it has a clear geometric interpretation donoho and gasko 1992 singh and bárdossy 2012 wang et al 2019 formally the half space depth of a point p with respect to the finite set x with members x in the d dimensional space is defined as the minimum number of points of the set x lying on one side of a hyperplane through the point p the minimum is calculated over all possible hyperplanes formally the half space depth of the point p dx p with respect to set x is defined as 1 d x p inf m i n x x u x p 0 x x u x p 0 here x x is the scalar product of the d dimensional vectors u is an arbitrary unit vector in the d dimensional space representing the normal vector of a selected hyperplane sh and sh is the cardinality of the set sh the convex hull of a set of points sh is the smallest convex set e g convex polygon in 2d which encloses sh fig 1 points on and near the boundary of this convex hull have low depth while points deep inside have high depth one advantage of this depth function is that it is invariant to affine transformations of the space this means that the different ranges of the vectors have no influence on the calculated depth in applying this method to prescribe a set of reference catchments we first selected a number of gauged catchments to construct a convex hull we then calculated the depth for a chosen ungauged catchment in terms of six catchment characteristic variables described below this process was repeated for varying numbers of gauged catchments until the depth for the ungauged basin was a maximum with respect to the selected gauged catchments 2 1 2 selection of catchment characteristic variables a wide range of pch variables correlating with qm and q100 were examined as potential candidates for the identification of similar catchments we did not include statistical properties of site data mainly because statistical homogeneity does not necessarily arise from physical homogeneity ilorme and griffis 2013 channel length stream channel frequency forest cover soil drainage depth weighted macroposity minimum porosity erosion index and hydrogeology index defined and described in beable and mckerchar 1982 hutchinson 1990 and mckerchar 1991 were found not to be diagnostic to characterise physical catchment aspects governing generation of flood runoff we finally chose area a as a measure of catchment dimension and for topography mean elevation e and main channel slope s initially we sought to use rainfall intensity for a duration equal to catchment time of concentration as a climate measure however the only formula available to calculate time of concentration for new zealand griffiths and mckerchar 2012 requires estimation of a manning channel roughness coefficient for each catchment and this is only available for a very limited number of basins used in this study additionally although rainfall intensity for a given duration may be determined nationally using the high intensity rainfall design system hirds thompson 2002 its accuracy varies considerably among catchments depending upon the availability of relevant rainfall data for these reasons mean annual rainfall p was employed as a surrogate variable for climate lastly for hydrology we chose mean annual 7 day low flow l as a measure of catchment storage and for drainage capacity and rate the drainage density d we thought that these six variables a large number would allow sharp definition of a small number of similar catchments from a set having very diverse physical characteristics and flood generation behaviours table 1 2 2 estimation of mean annual flood in order to capture the pch information provided by the selected similar catchments we adopted a nonparametric method as opposed for example to spatial interpolation skoien et al 2006 of nonparametric regression using a second order gaussian kernel li and racine 2003 to estimate qm at each of the n similar sites based on the function 2 q mr f a p s e l d where f is kernal function a nonparametric approach was used because the relationship in eq 2 is unknown and nonlinear furthermore a nonparametric model can capture more subtle aspects of the data and it has more degrees of freedom and is more flexible li and racine 2003 eq 2 was evaluated using the np package of r hayfield and racine 2008 now the measured values of qm at each similar site qma are known and we capitalise on this information to predict a set of n values of qm for the ungauged site qms using the transfer equation robson and reed 1999 3 q ms q mru q ma q mru in which qmru is the predicted value of qm at the ungauged site obtained from eq 2 the last step is to take the geometric mean of the qms values to obtain the predicted value of qm at the ungauged site qmsf given by 4 q msf i 1 n q ms 1 n 2 3 estimation of quantile flood supplied values of q100 were calculated from site annual maxima by fitting general extreme value gev distributions using the method of l moments hosking and wallis 1997 mckerchar and pearson 1990 employed this approach for reasons given in hosking and wallis 1997 and the results of testing the fits of a wide range of statistical distributions to new zealand flood data by beable and mckerchar 1982 owing to the paucity of data and issues about accuracy at some sites historic flood information was not employed in the estimation of q100 the same roi approach used to calculate qm was used to estimate q100 2 4 performance assessment a jack knife resampling procedure is employed to assess the performance of our approach to flood frequency estimation this consists firstly of considering each gauged site in a set of n sites as an ungauged one and then removing it temporarily from the set the remaining n 1 sites are then used to find similar catchments and calculate a value of qmsf and q100 for the ungauged site the process is repeated for all n sites two statistical performance measures are then calculated the relative error re given by 5 re q p q b q b in which qp is the predicted value and qb is the measured value at a site and the relative root mean square error rrmse given by 6 rrmse 1 n i 1 n r e 1 2 2 5 data selection lists of annual maximum flood peak discharges at hydrological recording stations fig 2 located on natural rural catchments were supplied by regional councils national institute of water and atmospheric research ltd and others only catchments without large lakes or other impoundments diversions substantial water abstractions or land use changes were included a minimum record length 10 years was adopted to allow for areas where records were sparse data suitability in terms of stage measurement and rating curves and related matters was assessed by hydrologists in the supplying organisations for the north island the number of sites was 362 and for the south island 243 relevant statistics for the pch parameters a p e l s d are listed in table 1 walter 2000 lists values of a calculated from 1 50 000 scale topographic maps p was obtained from the national rainfall surface of tait et al 2006 e was calculated from 1 50 000 scale topographic maps s was estimated using the taylor schwarz method taylor and schwarz 1952 l from site flow records and d by computing stream lengths depicted on 1 50 000 scale topographic maps values of l and d were not available for the south island however analysis using a limited data set indicated that l and d were unlikely to be diagnostic because of very low correlation with qm or q100 which in the case of d arises because it has low variability in the south island singh et al 2019 finally the assumption is made in fitting the gev distribution that the annual maxima at a site are independent and identically distributed random variables to check this assumption the maxima were examined statistically and pictorially for evidence of trend persistence periodicity and shifts in particular we employed the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 for trend spearman rank order correlation test spearman 1904 for persistence mann whitney split sample test wilcoxon 1945 mann 1945 and whitfield 1947 for location difference and the wald wolfowitz split sample test wald and wolfowitz 1940 for any difference the two split sample tests were conducted on 50 50 splits in nearly all cases the null hypothesis was accepted at the 0 05 significance level the exceptions were 63 sites which showed evidence of trend of which 43 were positive and 20 negatives however there was no evidence of spatial clustering nor of monotonic change in q m values and in most cases the site record was short 10 years or less consequently none of the trends were accepted as being long term and sites exhibiting trend was still included for analysis similar results regarding independence and identical distributions were obtained by mckerchar and pearson 1990 and for annual maximum rainfalls by griffiths et al 2014 3 results the roi procedure was applied to estimate qm and q100 treating each site in turn as an ungauged site and the remainder as a source of potential similar catchments for a baseline comparison bearing in mind previous work by beable and mckerchar 1982 and mckerchar and pearson 1989 qm and q100 values were also estimated using multiple nonlinear regression mr in the form 7 q m q 100 a a b p c s e e f l g d h where a b h are constants performance as assessed by rb and rrmse was determined where appropriate along with an examination of the distribution of rrmse magnitude as a function of the number of sites employed additionally an approximate method for estimating error size in the prediction of qm and q100 values was determined in presenting details north island and south island sites are treated separately 3 1 north island 3 1 1 mean annual flood in the selection of similar catchments using the half space depth function eq 1 it was found by trial and error that the best result was obtained almost invariably by employing n 12 similar catchments also in applying eq 1 the only statistically significant pch parameters were always found to be a and p contrary to our initial view which led to eq 2 table 2 lists the performance result of roi for qm the rrmse value of 164 for qm is very large to explore this result further we plotted number of sites as a proportion of the total number of sites sn against rrmse and fitted the result using a variety of probability distributions including weibull gumbel gev lognormal pareto and log logistic the best fit using maximum likelihood fig 3 is provided by the latter given by 8 s n 1 1 rrmse α β where α and β are parameters table 3 lists parameter values and the kolmogorov smirnov and cramer von mises goodness of fit statistics it can be seen from fig 3 that the large rrmse value for all 362 sites mainly owes to large individual rrmse values from a number of sites which have some pch parameters substantially different from those of the relevant sets of similar sites for those catchments treated as ungauged sites these natural catchments emerge as statistical outliers in the analysis because of the effect on flood generation of for instance pumice soils karst landscapes glacial outwash deposits rain shadows and hollows which provide extensive detention storage during storms we were unable to discover any pattern or trend or grouping regarding location or in the values of the pch parameters for the outlier catchments moreover many of the outlier sites were originally installed to represent a group of catchments thought to be unlike any other group ministry of works 1970 lists 68 so called representative basins with flow measurement sites established at that time as part of a programme to obtain hydrological information from the 90 hydrological regions of new zealand delimited by toebes and palmer 1969 given the assumption of representativeness no other site installations among the represented group were deemed to be necessary resulting in difficulties for a roi or mr approach to flood estimation with the mr method the only statistically significant pch parameters were a and p table 4 lists the coefficients and exponents and fitting statistics relating to the use of eq 7 the rrmse is 613 table 2 which could be reduced by perhaps forming physically bounded fixed homogenous regions although that approach has attendant boundary definition and other problems described by hosking and wallis 1997 the roi approach is clearly superior here it is of importance in practical applications to be able to estimate the re value of an estimate of qm or q100 reu qm q100 at an ungauged site we assumed that the greater the differences between values of a and p in the ungauged basin from those in a set of reference catchments along with d then the larger the value of reu qm q100 accordingly we adopted the formula 9 r e u q m q 100 f a d p d d in which 10 a d a u a r where au is the value of a in the ungauged basin and ar is the geometric mean of the values of a in the reference basins and similarly for pd eq 9 was fitted to the various data sets using nonparametric kernel regression as for eq 2 goodness of fit statistics are given in table 5 and it may be inferred from the degree of explanation of variance r2 therein that estimates of reu qm will be rather approximate 3 1 2 quantile flood as in the estimation of qm 12 similar basins were generally employed and the only statistically significant parameters in the use of eq 7 were a and p table 2 lists the performance result of roi for q100 the rrmse value of 399 is much larger than the value of 164 for qm this is to be expected statistically as the precision of estimate of a quantile is normally substantially less than for a mean the log logistic distribution of the rrmse errors has the same pattern for the same reasons as in the case of qm with the goodness of fit statistics listed in table 3 with the mr method a and p were again the only statistically significant pch parameters values of the constants in eq 7 and the fitting statistics are given in table 4 the rrmse value of 485 indicates that this approach is not useful for design lastly table 5 lists the reu q100 value and as may be expected it is much larger than the result for qm 3 2 south island 3 2 1 mean annual flood as in the north island analysis of mean annual flood 12 similar catchments were employed in the roi approach and the only statistically significant pch parameters were a and p for both roi and mr methods performance results for re and rrmse tables 3 4 and for reu qm table 5 mirror corresponding results for the north island but errors are smaller in magnitude again large individual rrmse values from a small number of sites were mainly responsible for the rrmse value of 123 for all 243 sites table 2 these differences between north and south island results are consistent with earlier work by beable and mckerchar 1982 who defined four homogeneous flood regions in the south island as opposed to six in the north island moreover the contours of qm a0 8 of mckerchar and pearson 1990 for new zealand are much less contorted in the south island we suggest that the principal reason for the differences is that the rainfall pattern as shown by the spatial distribution of p is simpler in the south island here the southern alps essentially divide the island into two regions a very wet western region with an average value of p 4 m and eastern region with p 1 5 m on average additionally there is a relative absence of porous volcanic deposits to complicate storage aspects of storm runoff 3 2 2 quantile flood as in the estimation of q100 for the north island 12 similar basins were employed and the only statistically significant parameters in the use of eq 2 were a and p the differences in performance behaviour between the north and south islands as regards magnitude of errors were similar to those found in the estimation of qm tables 2 4 and 5 and for the same reasons 4 future work refinement of this approach to flood frequency estimation is desirable in at least seven areas firstly catchment mean annual rainfall should be replaced as a catchment characteristic by rainfall intensity of an appropriate duration determined perhaps by improved estimates of time of concentration or otherwise secondly in the meantime more precise estimates of catchment mean annual rainfall could be made using a simple water balance involving measured annual values of runoff evapotranspiration and rainfall as significant differences were observed between mean annual rainfall found from the rainfall surface and that from a catchment water balance considerable future work is needed to reconcile or resolve this issue thirdly further investigation of more diagnostic pch variables is needed to sharpen the process of selecting similar catchments fourthly techniques other than the one used here such as neural networks ensemble methods kriging and neuro fuzzy influence systems wazneh et al 2016 warrant testing to see if any improves on the performance of our approach fifth selection of a variable number of similar catchments needs to be investigated with final selection determined using heterogeneity measures as described by for instance requena et al 2017 sixth an evaluation of the performance of the approach in both descriptive and predictive frameworks for a range of return periods is desirable for improved assessment of relative merits lastly more data are required from catchments like those presently yielding very large rb and rrmse values however even if the foregoing suggestions are implemented it is unlikely that for example the rrmse of qm in the north island of 164 would reduce to a highly desirable value for design of say 30 it would appear that a different approach involving rainfall runoff models could usefully be pursued in parallel such as continuous simulation lamb et al 2016 or derived distributions bloschl et al 2013 for flood design in ungauged catchments both these approaches which also allow estimation of flood volume duration and translation time require much more development for instance knowledge of hyetograph patterns and areal distribution of rainfall is at a reconnaissance level in new zealand singh et al 2018a b 5 conclusions statistical depth functions may be used to select gauged catchments having similar flood generation behaviours to an ungauged catchment information on catchment characteristics dominantly area and precipitation from both the selected and ungauged basin may then be employed to estimate the magnitude of mean annual and a quantile flood average relative error and relative root mean square error values as assessed by jack knife resampling are too large for use in detailed design but are much smaller than those obtained using a conventional multiple regression approach the probable reason for the substantial error magnitudes as evinced by the distribution of errors among sites owes to a relatively small number of statistical outliers in the various site samples the outliers are natural catchments which have particular characteristics which affect flood generation in a way as to render them almost unique relative error of the mean and quantile flood estimates in an ungauged catchment outside our data sets may be predicted using a relationship involving differences in area rainfall and statistical depth between the ungauged basin and gauged similar catchments improvements in the selection of catchment characteristics and their accuracy of measurement along with the employment of possibly better analytical techniques should reduce error magnitudes substantially but not perhaps to values desirable for specific design situations in ungauged basins parallel development involving usually very resource and information demanding rainfall runoff models is highly desirable but considerable improvement in flood estimation in ungauged catchments employing this approach is a distant prospect in new zealand given the lack of requisite detailed temporal and spatial information on rainfall in particular the methodology presented in this paper may be applied internationally

5246,a region of influence approach in which statistical depth functions are used to select gauged catchments having similar flood generation behaviour to a given ungauged basin coupled with nonparametric regression on catchment characteristics is employed to estimate mean annual and a quantile flood of 100 year return period in new zealand basins this approach may be applied internationally relative and root mean square errors assessed by jack knife resampling are too large to be useful for detailed design in ungauged catchments but are much smaller than those resulting from a conventional multiple nonlinear regression approach the distribution of errors for samples of sites indicates that large error values result from contributions from a relatively small number of statistical outliers although these are all natural catchments the outlier basins have particular physical characteristics such as moraines karst features and pumice sediments which affect their flood generation processes relative errors in estimates for an ungauged basin may be predicted using a relationship involving differences in area rainfall and statistical depth between the ungauged catchment and gauged similar catchments improved analytical techniques and selection and measurement of catchment characteristics should reduce error magnitude but not perhaps sufficiently for use in

presently available resources moreover extreme value frequency analysis is still normally required for predictions involving large return periods asadi et al 2018 as the nature of this study is operational rather than an exploration of new methods we employ the most common method of regional flood frequency analysis of defining homogenous regions and undertaking regional analysis within them to predict flood peak size of given return period at an ungauged site using data from gauged sites specifically we employ the regional flood method dalrymple 1960 hosking and wallis 1997 where the index is taken as the mean annual flood q m the mean of a record of annual maximum flood peak discharges q at a site and site growth curves are defined by q q m versus t where t is the return period in new zealand the first national study of flood frequency was undertaken by beable and mckerchar 1982 the index flood method was employed and q m was expressed as a function of catchment area a and one or two rainfall parameters in each of nine separate homogeneous regions which tended to correspond to lithologic and climatic regions extreme value type i ev1 and type ii ev2 distributions were fitted by the method of maximum likelihood to annual maxima including some historic peaks from 152 sites located throughout the country to define growth curves in eight separate homogeneous regions which tended to correspond to climatic regions mckerchar and pearson 1989 also adopted an index flood approach and presented national contour maps of a form of specific mean annual flood discharge q m a 0 8 in which a is catchment area and of a regional frequency factor q 100 q m where q 100 is the flood peak for t 100 yr some 324 sites were used in contouring specific flood discharge and 275 for the regional frequency factor estimated by fitting ev1 distributions using probability weighted moments no historic data were included an analysis of performance using independent sites was not undertaken by beable and mckerchar 1982 or mckerchar and pearson 1989 1990 in this study we also adopt the index flood approach but as an alternative to fixed boundary regions we employ non contiguous homogeneous regions composed of gauged catchments having similar hydrological behaviour particularly as concerns flood generation to an ungauged or target site these sets of similar catchments or basins are also variously described in the literature as pooling groups or hydrological neighbourhoods two main methods of analysis are used namely region of influence roi acreman and wiltshire 1989 burn 1990 and canonical correlation analysis cca ouarda et al 2001 and it has been shown by for instance ouarda et al 2001 and haddad et al 2015 that these methods can improve upon fixed region approaches determination of a group of similar catchments involves use of a similarity measure between the ungauged site and the gauged ones for example weighted euclidean distance burn 1990 gaal et al 2008 within a space defined by physiographic climate and hydrological pch variables or the mahalanobis distance also defined by the pch variables both these methods have drawbacks concerning robustness against outliers affine invariance and require normality of site characteristics instead following the work done by chebana and ouarda 2008 we use depth functions tukey 1975 to select similar catchments within a space defined by pch variables as they appear to outperform the above approaches chebana and ouarda 2008 wazneh et al 2016 nonparametric regression techniques are then used on pch data from the similar catchments to estimate q m at the target site values of a quantile flood q100 are then determined as for qm the single quantile was selected to allow general comparison with earlier work by beable and mckerchar 1982 mckerchar and pearson 1990 mckerchar 1991 and griffiths and mckerchar 2012 and because there are relatively few sites with long records median record length for all sites is 18 years see also chebana and ouarda 2008 moreover most flood protection design in new zealand is employs flood peak estimation for q100 and our focus is on presenting an alternative approach specifically the aim of the study is to present a variation to a standard method of flood frequency analysis and use it to estimate flood peak magnitudes of given return period in new zealand 2 methods in applying the index flood method the most difficult step involves the definition of homogeneous regions consisting in this study of pooling groups of similar catchments with gauged sites having similar flood generation characteristics or attributes to a nominated ungauged site this step is as crucial to the performance of the method as it is complex once a set of similar catchments has been selected estimation of qm and q100 is an easier task which can be readily completed using well established techniques we now describe the various steps involved in our approach including methods used to assess its performance as applied in new zealand 2 1 selection of similar catchments 2 1 1 depth function data depth is a quantitative measurement of how central a point is with respect to a multivariate data cloud or a probability distribution it gives a central outward ordering of multivariate data points and yields simple new ways to quantify complex multivariate features of the underlying multivariate distribution li et al 2012 liu et al 1999 the first depth function was introduced by tukey 1975 to identify the centre a generalized median of a multivariate dataset generalizations of this concept have been defined by barnett 1976 liu et al 2006 zuo and serfling 2000 data depth functions have been applied in several fields of non parametric multivariate analysis andrew et al 2000 hamurkaroglu et al 2006 liu 1995 liu and singh 1993 messaoud et al 2004 serfling 2002 stoumbos et al 2001 li et al 2012 application of the data depth function is relatively new in the field of water resources it has been used in the field of regional flood frequency analysis chebana and ouarda 2008 wazneh et al 2013a b 2015 depth based multivariate descriptive statistics

defining soil moisture dynamics based on a crtical event wang et al 2019 for further details about the data depth function and its uses in the field of water resources see chebana and ouarda 2011a chebana and ouarda 2011c guerrero et al 2013 krauße and cullmann 2009 chebana and ouarda 2008 and singh and bárdossy 2012 several types of data depth functions have been developed for instance half space projection l1 simplicial volume and mahalanobis depth functions the most important properties of a depth function are i affine invariance ii maximality at center iii monotonicity related to the deepest point and iv vanishing at infinity these properties fit the constraints of regional flood frequency analysis chebana and ouarda 2008 the half space depth function tukey 1975 was used in this study because it satisfies all the properties of a depth function is easy to calculate and is robust singh et al 2016 also it has a clear geometric interpretation donoho and gasko 1992 singh and bárdossy 2012 wang et al 2019 formally the half space depth of a point p with respect to the finite set x with members x in the d dimensional space is defined as the minimum number of points of the set x lying on one side of a hyperplane through the point p the minimum is calculated over all possible hyperplanes formally the half space depth of the point p dx p with respect to set x is defined as 1 d x p inf m i n x x u x p 0 x x u x p 0 here x x is the scalar product of the d dimensional vectors u is an arbitrary unit vector in the d dimensional space representing the normal vector of a selected hyperplane sh and sh is the cardinality of the set sh the convex hull of a set of points sh is the smallest convex set e g convex polygon in 2d which encloses sh fig 1 points on and near the boundary of this convex hull have low depth while points deep inside have high depth one advantage of this depth function is that it is invariant to affine transformations of the space this means that the different ranges of the vectors have no influence on the calculated depth in applying this method to prescribe a set of reference catchments we first selected a number of gauged catchments to construct a convex hull we then calculated the depth for a chosen ungauged catchment in terms of six catchment characteristic variables described below this process was repeated for varying numbers of gauged catchments until the depth for the ungauged basin was a maximum with respect to the selected gauged catchments 2 1 2 selection of catchment characteristic variables a wide range of pch variables correlating with qm and q100 were examined as potential candidates for the identification of similar catchments we did not include statistical properties of site data mainly because statistical homogeneity does not necessarily arise from physical homogeneity ilorme and griffis 2013 channel length stream channel frequency forest cover soil drainage depth weighted macroposity minimum porosity erosion index and hydrogeology index defined and described in beable and mckerchar 1982 hutchinson 1990 and mckerchar 1991 were found not to be diagnostic to characterise physical catchment aspects governing generation of flood runoff we finally chose area a as a measure of catchment dimension and for topography mean elevation e and main channel slope s initially we sought to use rainfall intensity for a duration equal to catchment time of concentration as a climate measure however the only formula available to calculate time of concentration for new zealand griffiths and mckerchar 2012 requires estimation of a manning channel roughness coefficient for each catchment and this is only available for a very limited number of basins used in this study additionally although rainfall intensity for a given duration may be determined nationally using the high intensity rainfall design system hirds thompson 2002 its accuracy varies considerably among catchments depending upon the availability of relevant rainfall data for these reasons mean annual rainfall p was employed as a surrogate variable for climate lastly for hydrology we chose mean annual 7 day low flow l as a measure of catchment storage and for drainage capacity and rate the drainage density d we thought that these six variables a large number would allow sharp definition of a small number of similar catchments from a set having very diverse physical characteristics and flood generation behaviours table 1 2 2 estimation of mean annual flood in order to capture the pch information provided by the selected similar catchments we adopted a nonparametric method as opposed for example to spatial interpolation skoien et al 2006 of nonparametric regression using a second order gaussian kernel li and racine 2003 to estimate qm at each of the n similar sites based on the function 2 q mr f a p s e l d where f is kernal function a nonparametric approach was used because the relationship in eq 2 is unknown and nonlinear furthermore a nonparametric model can capture more subtle aspects of the data and it has more degrees of freedom and is more flexible li and racine 2003 eq 2 was evaluated using the np package of r hayfield and racine 2008 now the measured values of qm at each similar site qma are known and we capitalise on this information to predict a set of n values of qm for the ungauged site qms using the transfer equation robson and reed 1999 3 q ms q mru q ma q mru in which qmru is the predicted value of qm at the ungauged site obtained from eq 2 the last step is to take the geometric mean of the qms values to obtain the predicted value of qm at the ungauged site qmsf given by 4 q msf i 1 n q ms 1 n 2 3 estimation of quantile flood supplied values of q100 were calculated from site annual maxima by fitting general extreme value gev distributions using the method of l moments hosking and wallis 1997 mckerchar and pearson 1990 employed this approach for reasons given in hosking and wallis 1997 and the results of testing the fits of a wide range of statistical distributions to new zealand flood data by beable and mckerchar 1982 owing to the paucity of data and issues about accuracy at some sites historic flood information was not employed in the estimation of q100 the same roi approach used to calculate qm was used to estimate q100 2 4 performance assessment a jack knife resampling procedure is employed to assess the performance of our approach to flood frequency estimation this consists firstly of considering each gauged site in a set of n sites as an ungauged one and then removing it temporarily from the set the remaining n 1 sites are then used to find similar catchments and calculate a value of qmsf and q100 for the ungauged site the process is repeated for all n sites two statistical performance measures are then calculated the relative error re given by 5 re q p q b q b in which qp is the predicted value and qb is the measured value at a site and the relative root mean square error rrmse given by 6 rrmse 1 n i 1 n r e 1 2 2 5 data selection lists of annual maximum flood peak discharges at hydrological recording stations fig 2 located on natural rural catchments were supplied by regional councils national institute of water and atmospheric research ltd and others only catchments without large lakes or other impoundments diversions substantial water abstractions or land use changes were included a minimum record length 10 years was adopted to allow for areas where records were sparse data suitability in terms of stage measurement and rating curves and related matters was assessed by hydrologists in the supplying organisations for the north island the number of sites was 362 and for the south island 243 relevant statistics for the pch parameters a p e l s d are listed in table 1 walter 2000 lists values of a calculated from 1 50 000 scale topographic maps p was obtained from the national rainfall surface of tait et al 2006 e was calculated from 1 50 000 scale topographic maps s was estimated using the taylor schwarz method taylor and schwarz 1952 l from site flow records and d by computing stream lengths depicted on 1 50 000 scale topographic maps values of l and d were not available for the south island however analysis using a limited data set indicated that l and d were unlikely to be diagnostic because of very low correlation with qm or q100 which in the case of d arises because it has low variability in the south island singh et al 2019 finally the assumption is made in fitting the gev distribution that the annual maxima at a site are independent and identically distributed random variables to check this assumption the maxima were examined statistically and pictorially for evidence of trend persistence periodicity and shifts in particular we employed the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 for trend spearman rank order correlation test spearman 1904 for persistence mann whitney split sample test wilcoxon 1945 mann 1945 and whitfield 1947 for location difference and the wald wolfowitz split sample test wald and wolfowitz 1940 for any difference the two split sample tests were conducted on 50 50 splits in nearly all cases the null hypothesis was accepted at the 0 05 significance level the exceptions were 63 sites which showed evidence of trend of which 43 were positive and 20 negatives however there was no evidence of spatial clustering nor of monotonic change in q m values and in most cases the site record was short 10 years or less consequently none of the trends were accepted as being long term and sites exhibiting trend was still included for analysis similar results regarding independence and identical distributions were obtained by mckerchar and pearson 1990 and for annual maximum rainfalls by griffiths et al 2014 3 results the roi procedure was applied to estimate qm and q100 treating each site in turn as an ungauged site and the remainder as a source of potential similar catchments for a baseline comparison bearing in mind previous work by beable and mckerchar 1982 and mckerchar and pearson 1989 qm and q100 values were also estimated using multiple nonlinear regression mr in the form 7 q m q 100 a a b p c s e e f l g d h where a b h are constants performance as assessed by rb and rrmse was determined where appropriate along with an examination of the distribution of rrmse magnitude as a function of the number of sites employed additionally an approximate method for estimating error size in the prediction of qm and q100 values was determined in presenting details north island and south island sites are treated separately 3 1 north island 3 1 1 mean annual flood in the selection of similar catchments using the half space depth function eq 1 it was found by trial and error that the best result was obtained almost invariably by employing n 12 similar catchments also in applying eq 1 the only statistically significant pch parameters were always found to be a and p contrary to our initial view which led to eq 2 table 2 lists the performance result of roi for qm the rrmse value of 164 for qm is very large to explore this result further we plotted number of sites as a proportion of the total number of sites sn against rrmse and fitted the result using a variety of probability distributions including weibull gumbel gev lognormal pareto and log logistic the best fit using maximum likelihood fig 3 is provided by the latter given by 8 s n 1 1 rrmse α β where α and β are parameters table 3 lists parameter values and the kolmogorov smirnov and cramer von mises goodness of fit statistics it can be seen from fig 3 that the large rrmse value for all 362 sites mainly owes to large individual rrmse values from a number of sites which have some pch parameters substantially different from those of the relevant sets of similar sites for those catchments treated as ungauged sites these natural catchments emerge as statistical outliers in the analysis because of the effect on flood generation of for instance pumice soils karst landscapes glacial outwash deposits rain shadows and hollows which provide extensive detention storage during storms we were unable to discover any pattern or trend or grouping regarding location or in the values of the pch parameters for the outlier catchments moreover many of the outlier sites were originally installed to represent a group of catchments thought to be unlike any other group ministry of works 1970 lists 68 so called representative basins with flow measurement sites established at that time as part of a programme to obtain hydrological information from the 90 hydrological regions of new zealand delimited by toebes and palmer 1969 given the assumption of representativeness no other site installations among the represented group were deemed to be necessary resulting in difficulties for a roi or mr approach to flood estimation with the mr method the only statistically significant pch parameters were a and p table 4 lists the coefficients and exponents and fitting statistics relating to the use of eq 7 the rrmse is 613 table 2 which could be reduced by perhaps forming physically bounded fixed homogenous regions although that approach has attendant boundary definition and other problems described by hosking and wallis 1997 the roi approach is clearly superior here it is of importance in practical applications to be able to estimate the re value of an estimate of qm or q100 reu qm q100 at an ungauged site we assumed that the greater the differences between values of a and p in the ungauged basin from those in a set of reference catchments along with d then the larger the value of reu qm q100 accordingly we adopted the formula 9 r e u q m q 100 f a d p d d in which 10 a d a u a r where au is the value of a in the ungauged basin and ar is the geometric mean of the values of a in the reference basins and similarly for pd eq 9 was fitted to the various data sets using nonparametric kernel regression as for eq 2 goodness of fit statistics are given in table 5 and it may be inferred from the degree of explanation of variance r2 therein that estimates of reu qm will be rather approximate 3 1 2 quantile flood as in the estimation of qm 12 similar basins were generally employed and the only statistically significant parameters in the use of eq 7 were a and p table 2 lists the performance result of roi for q100 the rrmse value of 399 is much larger than the value of 164 for qm this is to be expected statistically as the precision of estimate of a quantile is normally substantially less than for a mean the log logistic distribution of the rrmse errors has the same pattern for the same reasons as in the case of qm with the goodness of fit statistics listed in table 3 with the mr method a and p were again the only statistically significant pch parameters values of the constants in eq 7 and the fitting statistics are given in table 4 the rrmse value of 485 indicates that this approach is not useful for design lastly table 5 lists the reu q100 value and as may be expected it is much larger than the result for qm 3 2 south island 3 2 1 mean annual flood as in the north island analysis of mean annual flood 12 similar catchments were employed in the roi approach and the only statistically significant pch parameters were a and p for both roi and mr methods performance results for re and rrmse tables 3 4 and for reu qm table 5 mirror corresponding results for the north island but errors are smaller in magnitude again large individual rrmse values from a small number of sites were mainly responsible for the rrmse value of 123 for all 243 sites table 2 these differences between north and south island results are consistent with earlier work by beable and mckerchar 1982 who defined four homogeneous flood regions in the south island as opposed to six in the north island moreover the contours of qm a0 8 of mckerchar and pearson 1990 for new zealand are much less contorted in the south island we suggest that the principal reason for the differences is that the rainfall pattern as shown by the spatial distribution of p is simpler in the south island here the southern alps essentially divide the island into two regions a very wet western region with an average value of p 4 m and eastern region with p 1 5 m on average additionally there is a relative absence of porous volcanic deposits to complicate storage aspects of storm runoff 3 2 2 quantile flood as in the estimation of q100 for the north island 12 similar basins were employed and the only statistically significant parameters in the use of eq 2 were a and p the differences in performance behaviour between the north and south islands as regards magnitude of errors were similar to those found in the estimation of qm tables 2 4 and 5 and for the same reasons 4 future work refinement of this approach to flood frequency estimation is desirable in at least seven areas firstly catchment mean annual rainfall should be replaced as a catchment characteristic by rainfall intensity of an appropriate duration determined perhaps by improved estimates of time of concentration or otherwise secondly in the meantime more precise estimates of catchment mean annual rainfall could be made using a simple water balance involving measured annual values of runoff evapotranspiration and rainfall as significant differences were observed between mean annual rainfall found from the rainfall surface and that from a catchment water balance considerable future work is needed to reconcile or resolve this issue thirdly further investigation of more diagnostic pch variables is needed to sharpen the process of selecting similar catchments fourthly techniques other than the one used here such as neural networks ensemble methods kriging and neuro fuzzy influence systems wazneh et al 2016 warrant testing to see if any improves on the performance of our approach fifth selection of a variable number of similar catchments needs to be investigated with final selection determined using heterogeneity measures as described by for instance requena et al 2017 sixth an evaluation of the performance of the approach in both descriptive and predictive frameworks for a range of return periods is desirable for improved assessment of relative merits lastly more data are required from catchments like those presently yielding very large rb and rrmse values however even if the foregoing suggestions are implemented it is unlikely that for example the rrmse of qm in the north island of 164 would reduce to a highly desirable value for design of say 30 it would appear that a different approach involving rainfall runoff models could usefully be pursued in parallel such as continuous simulation lamb et al 2016 or derived distributions bloschl et al 2013 for flood design in ungauged catchments both these approaches which also allow estimation of flood volume duration and translation time require much more development for instance knowledge of hyetograph patterns and areal distribution of rainfall is at a reconnaissance level in new zealand singh et al 2018a b 5 conclusions statistical depth functions may be used to select gauged catchments having similar flood generation behaviours to an ungauged catchment information on catchment characteristics dominantly area and precipitation from both the selected and ungauged basin may then be employed to estimate the magnitude of mean annual and a quantile flood average relative error and relative root mean square error values as assessed by jack knife resampling are too large for use in detailed design but are much smaller than those obtained using a conventional multiple regression approach the probable reason for the substantial error magnitudes as evinced by the distribution of errors among sites owes to a relatively small number of statistical outliers in the various site samples the outliers are natural catchments which have particular characteristics which affect flood generation in a way as to render them almost unique relative error of the mean and quantile flood estimates in an ungauged catchment outside our data sets may be predicted using a relationship involving differences in area rainfall and statistical depth between the ungauged basin and gauged similar catchments improvements in the selection of catchment characteristics and their accuracy of measurement along with the employment of possibly better analytical techniques should reduce error magnitudes substantially but not perhaps to values desirable for specific design situations in ungauged basins parallel development involving usually very resource and information demanding rainfall runoff models is highly desirable but considerable improvement in flood estimation in ungauged catchments employing this approach is a distant prospect in new zealand given the lack of requisite detailed temporal and spatial information on rainfall in particular the methodology presented in this paper may be applied internationally

5247,infiltration based urban stormwater best management practices bmps are widely used for the reduction of runoff volumes and improvement of runoff quality in this paper closed form analytical equations collectively referred to as the analytical stormwater models asms are derived for analyzing the dynamic water balance of infiltration based bmps for simplicity previously developed asms only considered vertical infiltrations through the bottoms of infiltration based bmps although lateral infiltrations are not negligible and can even be the predominant ones in some real cases to overcome this limitation the asms developed in this study take into account infiltrations through the sides and the bottoms of bmps the concept of effective storage capacity is also proposed and used in this study to reduce the discrepancies caused by representing rainfall inputs as instantaneous pulses using infiltration trench as an example the acceptability of the simplifying assumptions based on which the asms are derived is demonstrated by comparing asms results with those from numerical simulations which do not require the same simplifying assumptions the effects of many influencing factors on the hydrologic performance of infiltrations trenches are also illustrated the asms are recommended as a computationally efficient alternative for use in the planning design and analysis of

averaging operator 1 introduction stormwater best management practices bmps are designed to control surface runoff in urban areas by means of detention retention infiltration and filtration other than the filtration flow through type bmps which do not change very much the local hydrological conditions the remaining bmps can generally be classified into the following two types according to their primary hydrological functions the storage retention based bmps and the infiltration based bmps fletcher et al 2013 szota et al 2019 characterized by their major hydrological function of recharging the subsurface and groundwater systems the infiltration based bmps include mainly infiltration trenches infiltration chambers dry wells grass swales infiltration basins and bioretention systems fletcher et al 2013 eckart et al 2017 d aniello et al 2019 in contrast the storage retention based bmps including detention ponds wang and guo 2019 rainwater harvesting systems zhang et al 2020 and green roofs shafique et al 2018b do not infiltrate surface runoff but retain or detain it for treatment or uses an infiltration trench is usually comprised of a storage reservoir filled with gravel aggregates or plastic lattice structures and lined with geotextile filter cloths infiltration chambers have premanufactured modular structures serving as storage spaces which can temporarily hold stormwater trca and cvca 2010 infiltration basins are constructed of shallow impoundments lined with relatively permeable soils dry wells are excavated cylinder shaped pits with perforated sides and bottoms grass swales are vegetated open channels designed to convey runoff and reduce runoff by infiltration into the underlying soils shafique et al 2018a a bioretention cell is generally comprised of a vegetated ponding area underlaid by a permeable media layer where plants grow zhang and guo 2014 these infiltration based bmps have a similar storage structure mainly consisting of a depression storage layer a soil layer and a storage layer the inflows into these bmps usually consist of rainfall falling onto themselves and runoff from their contributing catchment areas the water losses from these bmps include the evapotranspiration from them and the infiltration through their sides and bottoms infiltration based bmps are designed to mainly reduce runoff volume and filter out pollutants since measured data about pollutant concentrations are usually not available the average runoff reduction ratio defined as the fraction of runoff that is captured and depleted by an infiltration trench over the long term can be used as a surrogate measure of the water quality control performance in the design of infiltration based bmps zhang et al 2016 two types of modelling approaches have been used for estimating the long term average runoff capture efficiency also denoted as the runoff reduction ratio of infiltration based bmps the continuous simulation approach and the design storm approach using the continuous simulation approach the hydrologic operation of an infiltration based bmp over an extended period of time is numerically simulated and the performance statistics are summarized based on detailed simulation results this approach can provide an accurate estimate of the long term average performance of the bmp systems using observed long term rainfall series as input to represent local climate conditions however continuous simulation is data intensive and time consuming to perform the conventional design storm approach is used to estimate the performance of stormwater management systems under a representative or average design storm event akan 2002 chahar et al 2011 it is not capable of directly quantifying the long term average hydrologic performance i e the fraction of runoff captured and depleted of bmp systems and it may result in the over design or under design of some of the bmps by representing the input rainfall series as a stochastic process comprised of individual instantaneous rainfall pulses and treating a stormwater biofilter as a storage bucket daly et al 2012 developed a model that can analytically describe the long term statistical behavior of the main variables affecting the water balance of stormwater biofilters biofilters may be viewed as a special type of bioretention systems equipped with underdrain pipes by describing the frequencies of occurrences of different rainfall events and inter event dry times using probability distribution functions and treating an infiltration trench as a storage reservoir guo and guo 2018a demonstrated that analytical equations capable of estimating the performance statistics of infiltration trenches may be derived incorporating a few simplifying assumptions about the operation of the trenches the probabilistic stochastic representation of rainfall series similar to what was used by daly et al 2012 and guo and guo 2018a was first proposed by eagleson 1978 rodriguez iturbe et al 1991 2004 milly 1993 and laio et al 2001 used the same stochastic representation of rainfall series for analyzing soil moisture dynamics in ecohydrology more recent studies demonstrated that similar stochastic modeling approaches can be applied for a range of urban drainage and stormwater management related problems bertassello et al 2018 guo 2016 guo et al 2018 guo and guo 2018b parolari et al 2018 pelak and porporato 2016 wang and guo 2018 2019 the mathematical foundations for stochastic processes that may be used to represent soil moisture fluctuations was provided by cox and isham 1986 in studying the queueing model of the virtual waiting time with a single server the mathematical problem of virtual waiting time for a single server was posed first and partly solved by takács 1955 that is why related stochastic processes are sometimes referred to as the takács processes previous studies by daly et al 2012 and guo and guo 2018a on infiltration based bmps only considered infiltration through the bottom of a bmp facility and did not consider infiltration through the sides of the facility while in the engineering design of infiltration based bmps all possible infiltration conditions need to be considered the aim of this study is to develop a stochastic stormwater model incorporating all possible infiltration conditions of infiltration based bmps the stochastic soil moisture model developed improved previously by rodriguez iturbe et al 1991 2004 milly 1993 and laio et al 2001 is modified and expanded in this study so that it can more accurately model all the hydrological processes involved in the operation of infiltration based bmps the concept of effective storage capacity is also proposed and used in this study to eliminate reduce the errors caused by representing rainfall inputs as instantaneous pulses which was used in previous stochastic modelling studies on soil moisture dynamics in the following the poisson process representing a long term rainfall series and the dynamic water balance of infiltration based bmps are described first analytical expressions that may be used for estimating the runoff capture efficiencies of infiltration based bmps are then derived finally the accuracy of the derived analytical equations is systematically verified by comparing analytical and continuous simulation results 2 methods 2 1 use of infiltration trenches with different operating conditions to represent different types of infiltration based bmps since the hydrologic conditions under which all the different kinds of infiltration based bmps operate are very similar in the following for the description of the constitution operation and performance of infiltration based bmps only infiltration trench will be used as an example for an infiltration trench as an option a soil layer may be placed on the top of its storage reservoir however it was later on determined that infiltration trenches with only stone storage layers outperform those with topsoil layers in reducing runoff volumes and peak discharges gironás et al 2009 similar to other infiltration based bmps infiltration trenches are designed to capture and store a certain amount of stormwater and allowing the stored water to slowly percolate into the surrounding soils woods ballard et al 2007 suspended pollutants and sediments carried by the captured stormwater can be filtered out through the void forming materials of the storage layers hatt et al 2007 therefore infiltration trenches can help control both stormwater quantity by reducing surface runoff volumes and peak discharge rates and stormwater quality by removing pollutants warnaars et al 1999 wef and asce ewri 2012 native soils surrounding the storage reservoir of an infiltration trench i e soils at the bottom and sidewalls of the trench affect the rate of infiltration of the stored water depletion of the stored water is also caused partly by evaporation overflow occurs when the storage reservoir of the trench is full and more runoff is still filling into the trench overflow is usually conveyed downstream by sewer pipes factors affecting the infiltration rates through the sides and the bottom of an infiltration trench include the water level in the trench and the hydraulic conductivity of the surrounding native soils a few studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of infiltration trenches considering both the sidewall and bottom infiltration e g duchene et al 1994 browne et al 2008 freni et al 2009 chahar et al 2011 lee et al 2014 in design analyses soils underneath and closely beside an infiltration trench may be assumed to be always saturated the infiltration rate can thus be assumed to be equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soils chahar et al 2011 as soils are actually not saturated all the time during a storm assuming infiltration rate as a constant equalling the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soils may result in a slight underestimation of the amount of infiltration chahar et al 2011 in design analyses or for design purposes however this assumption is widely accepted by many jurisdictions and researchers e g schueler and claytor 2000 pdep 2006 trca and cvca 2010 campisano et al 2011 chahar et al 2011 creaco and franchini 2012 in the rest of this section describing all the methods used for the development of analytical stormwater models for infiltration trenches the stochastic description of point rainfall series is introduced first the stochastic water balance equation for infiltration trenches is then presented together with detailed descriptions of inflows and water losses later on after incorporating the concept of effective storage capacity the stochastic water balance equation is analytically solved and based on the solutions the hydrologic performance indices of interest of infiltration trenches are also derived the results of these derivations form the bases of the three analytical stormwater models for infiltration trenches with different operating conditions as summarized at the end of this section 2 2 stochastic representation of rainfall series in order to analyze the statistical rainfall characteristics of a location the observed continuous rainfall series of the location is first separated into individual rainfall events by selecting a minimum inter event time miet hassini and guo 2016 with a suitable miet discrete rainfall events can be obtained and treated as statistically independent of each other adams and papa 2000 each rainfall event and its preceding dry period can be characterized by three characteristics i e rainfall event depth v event duration u and inter event time b or inter arrival time m which is equal to u plus b for many locations exponential probability density functions pdfs were found to fit well the observed frequency distributions of v u b and m adams and papa 2000 restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 exponential pdfs were therefore recommended for use in the design of stormwater management facilities by the u s environmental protection agency u s epa 1986 and have been widely accepted in many other regional studies around the world lee and kim 2018 segarra garcía 2020 shamsudin et al 2014 ursino 2015 zeng et al 2020 these exponential pdfs can be described as 1 f v v ζ exp ζ v v 0 2 f u u λ exp λ u u 0 3 f b b ψ exp ψ b b 0 4 f m m μ exp μ m m 0 where ζ 1 v λ 1 u ψ 1 b and µ 1 m are the distribution parameters in which is the ensemble average operator µ is the arrival rate events per unit time of rainfall events this probabilistic representation of the rainfall conditions of a location of interest was proposed first by eagleson 1978 the sequential occurrence of random rainfall events can also be described stochastically as a marked compound poisson process where individual rainfall events are treated as occurring instantaneously milly 1993 laio et al 2001 rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 in this study the point rainfall series is represented as consisting of instantaneous rainfall event jumps occurring in a poisson process with an arrival rate of µ and individual rainfall event depths following an exponential distribution shown in equation 1 2 3 dynamic water balance of infiltration trenches the following dynamic water balance equation of an infiltration trench is used to describe the water level fluctuations in its storage reservoir 5 d s d t i s t q s in equation 5 s ss sm is the dimensionless normalization of ss where ss is the amount of water held in the trench at time t expressed as depth of water mm over the trench surface area and sm is the storage capacity of the infiltration trench also expressed in depth of water mm over the trench surface area s is therefore the fraction of this storage capacity occupied by water at time t it is referred to as the trench s degree of saturation hereafter i s t is the net inflow rate to the trench expressed in the unit of dimensionless depth of water over the trench surface area or fractions of the total storage depth in the trench per unit time q s is the water loss rate from the trench also expressed in the unit of dimensionless depth of water over the trench surface area per unit time i s t and q s are both functions of s because how high the water level is inside the trench affects both the inflow and water loss rates q s is a function of s only because the daily and seasonal variations of evapotranspiration and infiltration losses from an infiltration trench due purely to the change in climate or underlying soil conditions are not considered the net inflow rate is also a function of time because rainfall may occur at any time and the exact rainfall amount is random equation 5 is an adaptation of the water balance equation used by rodriguez iturbe et al 1991 laio et al 2001 and rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 in studying soil moisture dynamics 2 3 1 net inflow rate an infiltration trench system includes the infiltration trench itself and its adjacent runoff contributing catchment the total inflow into the infiltration trench consists of the runoff generated from the adjacent catchment and the direct rainfall falling onto the trench surface in estimating runoff generated from the contributing catchment the catchment can be characterized as having a runoff coefficient ϕ dimensionless may be viewed as the fraction of the catchment that contributes runoff and depression storage sdc which is expressed as depth mm of water over the catchment area only when the input rainfall event depth exceeds sdc runoff will be generated from the catchment and the amount of runoff generated from the catchment is equal to ϕac v sdc where ac is the area of the catchment when the input rainfall event depth is less than or equal to sdc the runoff generated from the catchment is equal to zero unlike the contributing catchment rainfall falling directly onto the trench surface is 100 transformed to inflows into the trench so the trench surface may be viewed as another catchment with runoff coefficient equaling to 1 and zero depression storage denoting the trench surface bottom area as ab the ratio between the catchment area and the trench surface area is denoted as ra ac ab to simplify the calculations of the total inflow into the trench as a result of a rainfall event the trench surface and the catchment area is viewed as a lumped catchment area with a depression storage of sd which is the area weighted depression storage of the contributing catchment sdc and the trench surface zero the area weighted average depression storage sd can thus be estimated as s d 1 a b 0 ϕ a c s dc 1 a b ϕ a c ϕ r a s dc ϕ r a 1 after satisfying the depression storage loss sd the net total area that converts 100 of the remaining input rainfall into inflows is ab ϕac which is 1 ϕra times of the trench surface area the total volume of inflow into the trench as a result of a rainfall event with rainfall depth v can therefore be summarized as 6 v i 0 v s d 1 ϕ r a v s d v s d in equation 6 the total inflow volume vi is expressed in the unit of depth mm of water over the trench surface area that is why v sd is multiplied by 1 ϕra equation 6 also illustrates that an inflow event would occur only when the rainfall event depth is greater than sd that is why in using equation 6 vi might be slightly underestimated when v s d however rainfall events with v s d account for a very small portion of the total number of rainfall events and the runoff volume they produce is negligible because sd is usually much smaller than the average rainfall event depth treating v in equation 6 as the realization of a random variable following the exponential distribution described by equation 1 based on the functional relationship between vi and v as expressed in equation 6 and using the derived distribution theory adams and papa 2000 the pdf of v i denoted as f v i v i can be derived as 7 f v i v i d f v i v i d v i ζ ϕ r a 1 exp ζ ϕ r a 1 v i for v i 0 in equation 7 f v i v i is the cumulative distribution function of vi with v i 0 f v i v i can be determined as follows f v i v i p 1 ϕ r a v s d v i v s d 0 v i 1 ϕ r a s d ζ exp ζ v d v s d ζ exp ζ v d v exp ζ s d exp ζ ϕ r a 1 v i equation 7 shows that similar to v vi still follows an exponential distribution with a parameter that is a modification of ζ which is the distribution parameter of rainfall event volume v assuming that the individual inflow events all occur instantaneously the series formed by these individual inflows is comprised of the original input rainfall poisson process with rainfall events having volumes less than or equal to sd removed this new process is referred to as the censored process according to the statistical properties of poisson processes the censored process transformed from the original input rainfall process is still a poisson process cox and milly 1965 with a modified arrival rate of μ where μ μ s d f v v d v μ exp s d ζ the integration included in the calculation for μ ensures that only rainfall events with v sd are left because vi still follows an exponential distribution the new marked poisson process representing the series of inflows into an infiltration trench does not complicate the analytical tractability of the input rainfall poisson process rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 laio et al 2001 dimensionless normalization of some variables of interest are used for simplicity of notation for example the normalized inflow event depth that may flow into the trench s storage reservoir is denoted as r which is equal to vi sm then the pdf of the dimensionless individual inflow event depth r can be expressed as 8 f r r γ exp γ r for r 0 where γ ζ s m 1 ϕ r a is the distribution parameter equaling the inverse of the mean value of r as stated earlier the amount of water stored in the trench at any time when a random inflow event occurs is denoted as ss which is measured in the same unit as sm the storage fraction already occupied at the beginning of a random inflow event is therefore ss sm which is denoted as s and referred to as the trench s degree of saturation subsequent to an inflow event the normalized inflow event depth that is actually retained by the trench s storage reservoir is denoted as y when the normalized inflow event depth r exceeds the normalized storage space that is still available i e 1 s overflow by pass occurs and the actual retained normalized depth from the inflow event y is equal to 1 s otherwise the actual retained rainfall depth from the inflow event equals the normalized inflow event depth r incorporating the fact that r is exponentially distributed as shown in equation 8 the pdf of the normalized net inflow event depth y conditioned on the trench having an initial degree of saturation s denoted as f y s y s can be expressed as 9 f y s y s γ exp γ y exp γ 1 s δ y s 1 for 0 y 1 s where δ is the dirac delta function in equation 9 the probability mass of exp γ 1 s for y 1 s represents the probability that the trench s reservoir is filled by an inflow event given that the trench s initial degree of saturation is s at the start of the rainfall event the sequential number of instantaneous random net inflow event series from time zero to the current time t is denoted as i which takes values of 1 2 3 n t where n t is the total number of net inflow events occurred from time zero to time t the net inflow rate at time t can then be expressed as 10 i s t i 1 n t y i δ t t i where ti with i 1 2 n t is the arrival time of an inflow event in the sequential inflow event series from time zero to time t ti is distributed according to a poisson process with rate μ yi with i 1 2 n t is the sequence of random normalized net inflow event depth with distribution given by equation 9 it is noted here that the same stochastic representation with instantaneous inflow jumps is used in describing rainfall inputs for the study of soil moistures by laio et al 2001 rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 and botter et al 2009 2 3 2 water loss rate during the inter arrival periods of rainfall events inflow retained in an infiltration trench is depleted by evaporation and infiltration into the native soils underneath and surrounding the trench s storage reservoir infiltration may occur through both the bottom and sidewalls of the trench warnaars et al 1999 bergman et al 2011 although occurring at a small rate it was found that evaporation should also be considered in trench design guo and guo 2018a therefore the total water loss from a trench includes the bottom and side infiltration and evaporation of water from its storage reservoir when the amount of water stored in the trench is ss the total water loss rate q ss of an infiltration trench expressed as depth in mm of water over the trench surface area per unit time can be calculated as 11 q s s 0 s s 0 e a α b f b α s f s a s a b 0 s s s m where ab lw is the surface bottom area of a trench with length l and width w a s 2 l w s s is the area of the sidewalls of the trench from which infiltration occurs when water stored in the trench is ss ea is the evaporation rate fb is the infiltration rate from the trench bottom fs is the infiltration rate from the trench s sidewalls αb and αs are the safety factors used to reflect the compaction and clogging effects on the rate of infiltration from respectively the bottom and sides of the trench based on a few monitoring studies it was found that infiltration through the bottom of some trenches may be considered negligible due to clogging emerson and traver 2008 emerson et al 2010 the deposition of sediments would generally result in clogging of a trench with an increase in the time of operation siriwardene et al 2007 as a result the performance of infiltration trenches will gradually decrease as their service time increases revitt et al 2003 to ensure the long term satisfactory performance of infiltration trenches routine and proper inspection and maintenance are necessary to properly consider the effects of clogging and compaction a safety factor may be applied in determining the design infiltration rate of the surrounding soils laboratory experimental approaches to estimating the safety factor for considering clogging effects on infiltration trenches can be found in siriwardence et al 2007 and barraud et al 2014 therefore safety factors αb and αs are used to consider clogging effects in the proposed models since infiltration trenches are usually shallow excavations filled with gravels when there is water inside the trench the rate of evaporation directly from the trench and the rate of infiltration through the bottom of the trench are assumed to be occurring at constant rates not affected by the exact amount of water contained in the trench in equation 11 multiplying αsfs by as ab is to ensure that q ss is expressed in the unit of depth of water over the trench surface area per unit time the normalized water loss rate q s from the infiltration trench can be expressed as 12 q s q s s s m 0 s 0 c 1 s c 2 0 s 1 α b 0 α s 0 c 1 s e a c 1 s m 0 s 1 α b 0 α s 0 e a α b f b s m 0 s 1 α b 0 α s 0 where c 1 2 α s f s l w lw c 2 e a α b f b c 1 s m they are introduced to clearly show how the water loss rate is affected by s and also for simplification of notation in the case where αs equals 0 i e no infiltration occurs through the sides of the trench q s turns to be a constant independent of s considering the impacts of soil clogging and compaction i e using clogging factors αb and αs on the water loss rates of infiltration trenches their operating conditions may be classified into three possibilities 1 infiltration through both the bottom and sides of a trench i e when αb 0 and αs 0 2 infiltration only through the sides of a trench i e when αb 0 and αs 0 and 3 infiltration only through the bottom of a trench i e when αb 0 and αs 0 these possibilities are listed separately in equation 12 for infiltration based bmps other than infiltration trenches one of the above three operating conditions may be used to describe their water loss rates the corresponding three types of stochastic models will be derived and introduced later the water loss rate as a function of s described in equation 12 is a modification and extension of the water loss functions used by laio et al 2001 and rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 for the study of soil moisture dynamics 2 4 effective storage capacity rainfall events are treated as instantaneous pulses in the above stochastic analysis whereas in reality both inflow and water loss occur throughout the duration of a rainfall event instantaneous occurrence of inflows results in instantaneous overflows consequently the estimated overflow volume will be larger than the actual overflow volume this is because the additional storage space resulting from water losses that occur during a rainfall event can actually accommodate more inflows and result in less overflows to avoid the overestimation of overflows an extra storage capacity created by water losses occurring within a rainfall event may be added to the actual physical storage capacity the actual physical storage capacity is denoted as sc hereafter of a trench and the sum may be regarded as the trench s effective storage capacity this effective storage capacity should then be used as sm in all previous representations and calculations fig 1 presents the schematic of an infiltration trench s storage components and related water balance elements similar to other kinds of infiltration based bmps the physical storage provided by an infiltration trench is mainly contributed by its storage reservoir and the shallow depression storage created by the relatively low lying surface of the storage reservoir the total physical storage capacity of a trench sc can therefore be calculated as s c s dt r v d m 1 r v where sdt is the depression storage of the trench expressed in mm rv is the void ratio between the total void volume and the total solid volume of the storage reservoir dm is the depth of the storage reservoir for some other types of infiltration based bmps that are made up of a soil layer in addition to a depression storage layer and a storage layer the additional storage capacity provided by the soil layer can be calculated similarly as the depth of the soil layer multiplied by the soil s porosity the effective storage capacity sm may be estimated by considering an average representative rainfall event with duration u for this event sm may be calculated as 13 s m s c q s s u s c q s s λ where λ 1 u and λ is the distribution parameter for rainfall event duration q s s is the average water loss rate during this representative rainfall event it can be estimated as 14 q s s q 0 q u 2 where q0 and q u are the water loss rates at respectively the beginning and end of the representative rainfall event the water loss rates during a representative rainfall event can be estimated by approximating the water loss rate calculated using equation 11 as a linear function of ss i e q s s k s s where k q s c s c this simplification will only be used to estimate q0 and q u in equation 14 infiltration rates through native soils are usually much lower than the average intensities of rainfall events in addition inflows into a trench includes not only rainfall falling directly onto the trench surface but also runoff from its catchment as a result similar to other infiltration based bmps the typical operation of a trench during a rainfall event is that the trench is filled up quickly during the initial portion of the rainfall event and then the water loss rate from the trench gradually decreases because of the decrease of water contained in the trench if the process of the filling up of the trench is further simplified as occurring instantaneously at the beginning of the representative rainfall event the water loss rate during this event would be an exponential decreasing function of time thus the water loss rate at the beginning of the representative rainfall event q0 can be estimated as q sc while the water loss rate at the end of the representative rainfall event can be estimated as q u q s c exp k u according to equation 14 the average water loss rate can then be estimated as q s s q s c exp k λ q s c 2 substituting this expression of q s s into equation 13 sm can be estimated as 15 s m s c q s c exp q s c λ s c q s c 2 λ the introduction and use of effective storage capacity are for the purpose of improving the accuracy of the simplified stochastic description of the water balance of an infiltration trench previous research on stochastic soil moisture dynamics laio et al 2001 rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 botter et al 2009 verma et al 2011 did not incorporate any similar concepts however as shown later incorporation of the effective storage capacity concept greatly improves the accuracy of the final results 2 5 mathematical solution of the stochastic water balance equation the stochastic water balance shown in equation 5 is driven by a marked poisson process i s t this is similar to the water balance equations of soil moistures studied by laio et al 2001 and rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 as shown in these previous studies the steady state solution for the probability distribution of s from equation 5 can be derived by obtaining the corresponding chapman kolmogorov forward equations first cox and miller 1965 gardiner 2004 the steady state probability distribution of s denoted as h s consists of a discrete atom of probability f0 for s 0 and a continuous pdf f s for s 0 as shown in equation 12 when s increases from 0 to some infinitesimally small value the water loss rate q s jumps from 0 to a finite value this discontinuity of the water loss rate function q s at s 0 makes it possible for the trench to become and remain empty for some periods of time and thus results in the atom of probability f0 for s 0 as shown in detail by rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 the general solutions of f s and f 0 can be expressed as 16 f s c 3 q s exp γ s μ 0 s 1 q z d z for 0 s 1 17 f 0 c 3 μ for s 0 where c 3 is the normalization constant needed to satisfy the requirement that the total probability mass must equal one and z is the dummy variable of integration more details about the above solution processes can be found in the appendix explicit expressions of f s and f0 can be derived separately for the two possible q s cases with αs 0 or αs 0 when αs 0 q s is a linear increasing function of s by carrying out the integration in equation 16 for q s cases with αs 0 f s and f0 were found to be 18 f s c 3 c 4 exp γ s c 2 s c 2 μ c 1 1 for 0 s 1 19 f 0 c 3 μ for s 0 in equation 18 the constant c 4 c 2 μ c 1 exp γ c 2 c 1 is introduced to simplify notation in order to satisfy the requirement that 0 1 h s d s 1 c 3 was determined to be c 3 1 μ c 4 c 5 γ μ c 1 1 where c 5 γ μ c 1 γ 1 c 2 γ μ c 1 γ c 2 and γ represents the incomplete gamma function which is defined as γ a x 0 x z a 1 exp z d z the cumulative distribution function cdf of s h s can be derived as 20 h s f 0 0 s f s d s c 3 μ c 3 c 4 γ μ c 1 γ μ c 1 γ s c 2 γ μ c 1 γ c 2 for 0 s 1 when αs 0 q s is no longer a linear increasing function of s but remains constant for s 0 the derivation of f s and f0 is therefore different from the derivations for cases with αs 0 solution of the stochastic balance equation with a constant q s is known as the takács problem takács 1955 described in detail by cox and miller 1965 this constant water loss function q s for an infiltration trench has mathematically the same format as that for a combined sewer overflow detention tank with a constant outflow rate wang and guo 2018 solutions of a similar stochastic equation describing soil water balances was found by milly 1993 adapting from the solutions provided in these earlier studies f0 f s and h s for an infiltration trench with a constant water loss rate i e αs 0 can be expressed as follows 21 f 0 1 γ 1 μ η γ μ η γ μ η exp μ η γ γ μ η γ for s 0 22 f s γ γ 1 μ η γ μ η γ exp μ η γ γ η μ exp μ η γ s μ η γ for 0 s 1 23 h s γ s 1 γ 1 μ η γ μ η exp μ η γ s γ μ η exp μ η γ γ μ η γ where η g sm and g ea αb fb more detailed processes for obtaining equations 21 through 23 are provided in wang and guo 2018 which also demonstrates why for systems where μ η γ and μ η γ the solutions are different although the form of equations 21 through 23 used for infiltration trenches with a constant water loss rate is the same as those used in wang and guo 2018 for detention tanks the infiltration models used here describing the water loss functions contain more design variables than those contained in wang and guo 2018 2 6 estimation of average degree of saturation and average runoff capture efficiency the long term average amount of water stored in the trench s s in mm of water over the trench surface area can be expressed as s s s s c where s is the ensemble average degree of saturation and can be calculated as s 0 1 s h s d s the long term average water balance of an infiltration trench can be expressed as r q ω where r μ 0 r f r r d r is the normalized mean inflow rate into the trench q 0 1 q s h s d s is the normalized mean water loss rate from the trench and ω is the normalized mean overflow rate from the trench the average runoff capture efficiency of a trench er can be calculated as the ratio between the normalized mean long term average water loss rate and the normalized mean long term inflow rate i e e r q r for q s cases with αs 0 s and er were found to be 24 s c 3 c 4 c 6 c 7 γ c 2 c 5 where c 6 γ 1 μ c 1 c 7 γ μ c 1 1 γ 1 c 2 γ μ c 1 1 γ c 2 and 25 e r c 1 c 3 c 4 c 6 c 7 γ μ 1 for q s cases with αs 0

and 27 the long term average runoff capture efficiency provided by a trench can be easily calculated in addition equations 24 and 26 can be used to analytically determine the long term average amount of water stored in a trench while equations 18 through 23 can be used to quantify the chances of having different water levels in a trench the collection of these closed form analytical equations is referred to as the analytical stormwater model asm for infiltration trenches 2 7 three possible operating conditions equation 12 is used to represent three possible operating infiltration conditions the resulting asms are referred to as asm i for the case with αb 0 and αs 0 asm ii for the case with αb 0 and αs 0 and asm iii for the case with αb 0 but αs 0 for asm i equations 18 through 20 24 and 25 themselves with αb and αs both greater than zero can be used in the analysis of the hydrologic performance of infiltration trenches or other types of infiltration based bmps with infiltration through both their bottoms and sides asm ii which considers only infiltration from the sides of a trench is obtained by setting the bottom clogging factor αb 0 in equation 12 analytical equations for asm ii are the same as for asm i except that c 2 is simplified in asm ii since αb 0 asm iii which considers infiltration only through the bottom of a trench is obtained by setting the side clogging factor αs 0 the water loss rate function of asm iii is shown in equation 12 with αs 0 the collection of equations 21 through 23 26 and 27 themselves with αb 0 but αs 0 are used in asm iii for the design and analysis of infiltration trenches in addition to infiltration trenches these equations can also be used for infiltration basins and bioretention cells where infiltration through the bottom is the most predominant 3 example study areas and input data clearly with changes made to the definitions of some of the variables and parameters the above derived asms can be used for many different types of infiltration based bmps however for clarity in explanation the following example and verification studies still focus on infiltration trenches the storm water management model swmm is a widely used tool for modelling the performance of stormwater best management practices avellaneda et al 2017 to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed asms a set of continuous swmm u s epa version 5 1 rossman 2015 simulations were performed for urban catchments with different types of soils loam sandy loam and sand and different infiltration conditions asm i ii and iii hypothetical catchments were assumed to be located in two climatically different locations in the u s jackson mississippi with a humid climate and billings montana with an arid climate in the swmm simulations long term hourly rainfall records of jackson and billings obtained from the national climatic data center ncdc of the u s are used as input rainfall series and their rainfall statistics are shown in table 1 the rainfall event characteristics in table 1 are required for the use of asms the accuracy of the asms are examined by comparing their results with those from swmm continuous simulations the long term average runoff capture efficiency determined by swmm simulations is calculated as v swmm o swmm v swmm where vswmm and oswmm are respectively the total runoff volume and total overflow volume determined from swmm continuous simulation results the values of parameters used in the swmm simulations are listed in table 2 ϕ is assumed to be 1 for the contributing catchments of infiltration trenches in the case studies to simplify the illustration of the application and verification of asms fb and fs are treated as equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils which are 6 13 and 30 mm h for loam sandy loam and sandy soils respectively guo and gao 2016 both αb and αs are assumed to be 0 8 it should be noted that the swmm lid module is not capable of simulating infiltration from the sides of trenches as an alternative we used a storage unit with a total storage capacity of sc to represent a trench the outflow rate of this storage unit is controlled by an orifice with a specified rating curve the same as what is described by equation 12 this way outflows from this storage unit are equivalent to the water losses from infiltration trenches the inflows collected by the storage unit are from two subcatchments one representing the adjacent contributing catchment area and the other representing the trench surface area where rainfall falls directly 4 verification of the analytical stormwater models 4 1 overall accuracy of the analytical stormwater models using equation 15 to estimate sm three different asms were developed for infiltration trenches with different infiltration conditions to verify the accuracy of asms for all possible field conditions a comprehensive set of hypothetical cases with different characteristics are simulated by swmm and calculated using asms for each specific soil type and location 32 cases representing a combination of two different values of ra 10 and 50 and 16 different values of dm 50 100 200 1500 mm were simulated in addition 24 cases formed by a combination of two different values of dm 500 and 1000 mm and 12 different values of ra 1 2 5 5 10 50 for one specific soil type and location were also simulated two locations jackson and billings and three different soil types loam sandy loam and sand are considered for all the above described combinations resulting in a total of 324 cases for each asm models therefore for the verification of the three asm models a total of 972 cases were simulated by swmm and compared with asm results for each of these three asms their overall performance for 324 cases are presented in fig 2 treating the continuous simulation results of swmm as observed data root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and correlation coefficient cc between observed and asm model results can all be calculated in reality swmm models themselves would only provide accurate results when they are properly calibrated against observed data in this study since swmm models do not require the simplifications needed by the asms given enough data for calibration it is assumed that the swmm models can be properly calibrated and provide very accurate results the swmm models that were set up here for hypothetical cases are treated as based on calibrated parameter values and therefore provide results close to measurements as shown in fig 2 the values of nse and cc are very close to 1 and the values for rmse are close to 0 for all the three asms these statistical indices demonstrate that asm results resemble well swmm continuous simulation results for a wide range of possible operating conditions some of the modeled extreme operating conditions may not be recommended for infiltration trenches but they are possible or recommended for other types of infiltration based bmps including a wide range of cases in this verification study helps in illustrating that the asms are reliable for estimating the runoff capture efficiencies of almost all types of infiltration based bmps 4 2 effects of storage reservoir depth soil types and area ratios the depth of the storage reservoir dm determines the storage capacity of a trench which affects directly the overflow volumes the effects of dm on runoff capture efficiencies were investigated given an area ratio ra 10 a total of 48 cases for three soil types loam sandy loam and sand using asm i at jackson were simulated comparison between the asm and swmm results is presented in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the runoff capture efficiency increases when dm increases higher runoff capture efficiencies were achieved for soil types with greater infiltration capacities the largest absolute relative difference between asm and swmm results is 17 7 which is from the case with loam soil when dm is equal to 50 mm this is an extremely small dm value usually not selected for design close agreement between the two models can be observed from fig 3 generally the greater resemblance between asm and swmm results is observed when dm is larger this is because less overflows would occur when the trench has a larger storage capacity and as a result errors in the overestimation of overflows caused by the assumption of instantaneous inflows get smaller for an infiltration trench with a specific size the area ratio ra determines the contributing catchment area and therefore the inflow volume asm ii and simulation results are presented for two values of dm i e 500 and 1000 mm for demonstration purposes for each value of dm a total of 24 cases for a combination of two soil types loam and sand and 12 area ratios ra 1 2 5 5 10 50 at billings were simulated and plotted in fig 4 the decreasing curves in fig 4 show that runoff capture efficiency decreases with an increase of the area ratio because more runoff will be generated which would cause more overflows in cases with the same soil type and a same area ratio ra larger runoff capture efficiencies will be achieved when dm is larger at billings due to the larger storage capacity to retain more inflows and result in less overflows the largest absolute relative difference between asm and swmm is 10 0 which is from the case with loam soil when dm is equal to 1000 mm and ra approaches 30 overall the asm results agree well with swmm results for all 48 cases as shown in fig 4 4 3 effects of climate conditions two representative climatic conditions i e humid jackson and arid billings were simulated effects of climate conditions on runoff capture efficiency can be analyzed from the plotted er versus dm and ra curves in fig 5 for sandy loam soils with a dm of 500 mm 24 cases with different values of ra obtained from asm iii at the two locations were simulated for the same dm and ra the runoff capture efficiency obtained at billings is generally larger than that at jackson when ra is small taking ra 2 5 at jackson and ra 10 at billings as examples the runoff capture efficiencies are very close to 1 er 0 9 indicating that runoff contributed from catchments with such area ratios will be almost completely captured by the infiltration trenches as ra increases er decreases and finally stabilizes at about 0 21 at jackson and 0 43 at billings respectively when ra approaches 50 in addition when the soil type is sand and ra equals 10 asm ii results for 32 cases with various dm values were compared with swmm results and also shown in fig 5 similar conclusions of the effects of climatic conditions can also be reached the runoff capture efficiency of billings increases sharply from 0 25 to 0 92 as dm increases from 50 to 600 mm thereafter it rises slowly to 0 99 and stays at 0 99 when dm exceeds 1200 mm for jackson a smooth increasing trend of the runoff capture efficiency from 0 10 to 0 93 as dm goes up from 50 to 1500 mm is clear good agreements can also be observed in fig 5 which demonstrates again the accuracy of asms ii and iii 4 4 additional analysis in addition to runoff capture efficiency asms can provide many other useful performance indicators which cannot be directly provided by continuous simulation models example indicators may include the chance of having an empty trench and the long term average water level inside a trench the chance of having an empty trench or equivalently the fraction of time when the trench is empty is equal to the probability of having s 0 which is denoted as f0 and can be directly calculated using equation 19 or 21 the long term average water level inside a trench is simply the average degree of saturation s multiplied by dm in fact the pdf of s f s and the cumulative distribution function h s provide even more detailed information about the wetness that a trench experiences in its operation together they help designers gain a better understanding of the wetness characteristics varying with soil types climate conditions land use conditions and storage capacity using equations 18 26 asms can easily provide this kind of useful information example results are presented in fig 6 using asm i for jackson with dm 1000 mm and ra 10 probability distributions of s and the average degree of saturation s varying with three soil types were obtained and plotted in fig 6a and 6b for sandy loam soils at jackson and billings taking dm 500 mm as an example fig 6c and 6d show the analytical results of the probability distributions of s and s obtained by using asm ii it is worth noting that s are very small and f0 are quite high for all cases this demonstrates that infiltration trenches as usually designed at these two locations are indeed capable of infiltrating captured runoff and are usually in a state of being almost empty when a rainfall event randomly occurs fig 6 also shows that sandy soils and billings climate result in higher chances of having empty trenches i e higher f0 values as area ratio increases the chance of having empty trenches decreases and gradually stabilizes when ra approaches 50 these additional analysis results may not seem to be that useful for infiltration trenches but for infiltration basins and bioretention systems where the growing conditions of plants inside the facilities are also a major concern these additional results will be very helpful 5 concluding remarks in this paper three analytical stormwater models asms considering different operating conditions of infiltration based stormwater best management practices bmps were developed runoff capture efficiency chance of having empty facilities and the average water content inside a facility can all be analytically determined using the closed form equations comprising the asms effects of soil types area ratios sizes of storage reservoirs and climate conditions on the performance of infiltration facilities can all be easily and systematically investigated using these asms the accuracy of asms were verified by comparing their results with swmm continuous simulation results the comparisons demonstrate that the asms can provide reliable and accurate results for almost all possible design configurations as a useful and convenient alternative to continuous simulation models the proposed asms are recommended for use in the planning design and evaluation of the infiltration based bmps with any of the three possible operating conditions the usefulness and advantages of applying asms in practical design analysis which follows jurisdictional design guidelines will be studied in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

f0 f s and h s equation 5 is a stochastic differential equation since it is driven by a marked poisson process i e the inflow into the trench i s t the solution for the probability distribution of s from equation 5 can be derived by obtaining the corresponding chapman kolmogorov forward equations first botter et al 2009 cox and miller 1965 gardiner 2004 rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 from the start of operation of a trench the probability distribution of s denoted as h s t changes with time t and consists of a discrete atom of probability f0 t for s 0 and a continuous pdf f s t for s 0 due to the discontinuity of the normalized water loss rate function q s at s 0 shown in equation 11 the general form of the temporal evolution of f s t and f0 t as derived by rodriguez iturbe and

both the conditional probability distributions of inflows to a trench as expressed in equation 9 0 is a value infinitesimally larger than zero f 0 t lim s 0 f s t z is the dummy variable of integration as the operation time continues the infiltration trench system will eventually reach a steady state where the probability distribution of s will remain the same and does not change with time any more the steady state solutions of f s t and f0 t can be obtained by letting t approach infinity in equations a1 and a2 theoretically it would take an infinitely long time for the system to reach a steady state but a state fairly close to the steady state would be reached after perhaps a few months of operation and this approximate steady state is the only interest for the planning and design of infiltration trenches the steady state atom of probability for s 0 and the continuous pdf for s 0 are denoted as f0 and f s respectively by setting t to approach infinity in equations a1 and

5247,infiltration based urban stormwater best management practices bmps are widely used for the reduction of runoff volumes and improvement of runoff quality in this paper closed form analytical equations collectively referred to as the analytical stormwater models asms are derived for analyzing the dynamic water balance of infiltration based bmps for simplicity previously developed asms only considered vertical infiltrations through the bottoms of infiltration based bmps although lateral infiltrations are not negligible and can even be the predominant ones in some real cases to overcome this limitation the asms developed in this study take into account infiltrations through the sides and the bottoms of bmps the concept of effective storage capacity is also proposed and used in this study to reduce the discrepancies caused by representing rainfall inputs as instantaneous pulses using infiltration trench as an example the acceptability of the simplifying assumptions based on which the asms are derived is demonstrated by comparing asms results with those from numerical simulations which do not require the same simplifying assumptions the effects of many influencing factors on the hydrologic performance of infiltrations trenches are also illustrated the asms are recommended as a computationally efficient alternative for use in the planning design and analysis of

averaging operator 1 introduction stormwater best management practices bmps are designed to control surface runoff in urban areas by means of detention retention infiltration and filtration other than the filtration flow through type bmps which do not change very much the local hydrological conditions the remaining bmps can generally be classified into the following two types according to their primary hydrological functions the storage retention based bmps and the infiltration based bmps fletcher et al 2013 szota et al 2019 characterized by their major hydrological function of recharging the subsurface and groundwater systems the infiltration based bmps include mainly infiltration trenches infiltration chambers dry wells grass swales infiltration basins and bioretention systems fletcher et al 2013 eckart et al 2017 d aniello et al 2019 in contrast the storage retention based bmps including detention ponds wang and guo 2019 rainwater harvesting systems zhang et al 2020 and green roofs shafique et al 2018b do not infiltrate surface runoff but retain or detain it for treatment or uses an infiltration trench is usually comprised of a storage reservoir filled with gravel aggregates or plastic lattice structures and lined with geotextile filter cloths infiltration chambers have premanufactured modular structures serving as storage spaces which can temporarily hold stormwater trca and cvca 2010 infiltration basins are constructed of shallow impoundments lined with relatively permeable soils dry wells are excavated cylinder shaped pits with perforated sides and bottoms grass swales are vegetated open channels designed to convey runoff and reduce runoff by infiltration into the underlying soils shafique et al 2018a a bioretention cell is generally comprised of a vegetated ponding area underlaid by a permeable media layer where plants grow zhang and guo 2014 these infiltration based bmps have a similar storage structure mainly consisting of a depression storage layer a soil layer and a storage layer the inflows into these bmps usually consist of rainfall falling onto themselves and runoff from their contributing catchment areas the water losses from these bmps include the evapotranspiration from them and the infiltration through their sides and bottoms infiltration based bmps are designed to mainly reduce runoff volume and filter out pollutants since measured data about pollutant concentrations are usually not available the average runoff reduction ratio defined as the fraction of runoff that is captured and depleted by an infiltration trench over the long term can be used as a surrogate measure of the water quality control performance in the design of infiltration based bmps zhang et al 2016 two types of modelling approaches have been used for estimating the long term average runoff capture efficiency also denoted as the runoff reduction ratio of infiltration based bmps the continuous simulation approach and the design storm approach using the continuous simulation approach the hydrologic operation of an infiltration based bmp over an extended period of time is numerically simulated and the performance statistics are summarized based on detailed simulation results this approach can provide an accurate estimate of the long term average performance of the bmp systems using observed long term rainfall series as input to represent local climate conditions however continuous simulation is data intensive and time consuming to perform the conventional design storm approach is used to estimate the performance of stormwater management systems under a representative or average design storm event akan 2002 chahar et al 2011 it is not capable of directly quantifying the long term average hydrologic performance i e the fraction of runoff captured and depleted of bmp systems and it may result in the over design or under design of some of the bmps by representing the input rainfall series as a stochastic process comprised of individual instantaneous rainfall pulses and treating a stormwater biofilter as a storage bucket daly et al 2012 developed a model that can analytically describe the long term statistical behavior of the main variables affecting the water balance of stormwater biofilters biofilters may be viewed as a special type of bioretention systems equipped with underdrain pipes by describing the frequencies of occurrences of different rainfall events and inter event dry times using probability distribution functions and treating an infiltration trench as a storage reservoir guo and guo 2018a demonstrated that analytical equations capable of estimating the performance statistics of infiltration trenches may be derived incorporating a few simplifying assumptions about the operation of the trenches the probabilistic stochastic representation of rainfall series similar to what was used by daly et al 2012 and guo and guo 2018a was first proposed by eagleson 1978 rodriguez iturbe et al 1991 2004 milly 1993 and laio et al 2001 used the same stochastic representation of rainfall series for analyzing soil moisture dynamics in ecohydrology more recent studies demonstrated that similar stochastic modeling approaches can be applied for a range of urban drainage and stormwater management related problems bertassello et al 2018 guo 2016 guo et al 2018 guo and guo 2018b parolari et al 2018 pelak and porporato 2016 wang and guo 2018 2019 the mathematical foundations for stochastic processes that may be used to represent soil moisture fluctuations was provided by cox and isham 1986 in studying the queueing model of the virtual waiting time with a single server the mathematical problem of virtual waiting time for a single server was posed first and partly solved by takács 1955 that is why related stochastic processes are sometimes referred to as the takács processes previous studies by daly et al 2012 and guo and guo 2018a on infiltration based bmps only considered infiltration through the bottom of a bmp facility and did not consider infiltration through the sides of the facility while in the engineering design of infiltration based bmps all possible infiltration conditions need to be considered the aim of this study is to develop a stochastic stormwater model incorporating all possible infiltration conditions of infiltration based bmps the stochastic soil moisture model developed improved previously by rodriguez iturbe et al 1991 2004 milly 1993 and laio et al 2001 is modified and expanded in this study so that it can more accurately model all the hydrological processes involved in the operation of infiltration based bmps the concept of effective storage capacity is also proposed and used in this study to eliminate reduce the errors caused by representing rainfall inputs as instantaneous pulses which was used in previous stochastic modelling studies on soil moisture dynamics in the following the poisson process representing a long term rainfall series and the dynamic water balance of infiltration based bmps are described first analytical expressions that may be used for estimating the runoff capture efficiencies of infiltration based bmps are then derived finally the accuracy of the derived analytical equations is systematically verified by comparing analytical and continuous simulation results 2 methods 2 1 use of infiltration trenches with different operating conditions to represent different types of infiltration based bmps since the hydrologic conditions under which all the different kinds of infiltration based bmps operate are very similar in the following for the description of the constitution operation and performance of infiltration based bmps only infiltration trench will be used as an example for an infiltration trench as an option a soil layer may be placed on the top of its storage reservoir however it was later on determined that infiltration trenches with only stone storage layers outperform those with topsoil layers in reducing runoff volumes and peak discharges gironás et al 2009 similar to other infiltration based bmps infiltration trenches are designed to capture and store a certain amount of stormwater and allowing the stored water to slowly percolate into the surrounding soils woods ballard et al 2007 suspended pollutants and sediments carried by the captured stormwater can be filtered out through the void forming materials of the storage layers hatt et al 2007 therefore infiltration trenches can help control both stormwater quantity by reducing surface runoff volumes and peak discharge rates and stormwater quality by removing pollutants warnaars et al 1999 wef and asce ewri 2012 native soils surrounding the storage reservoir of an infiltration trench i e soils at the bottom and sidewalls of the trench affect the rate of infiltration of the stored water depletion of the stored water is also caused partly by evaporation overflow occurs when the storage reservoir of the trench is full and more runoff is still filling into the trench overflow is usually conveyed downstream by sewer pipes factors affecting the infiltration rates through the sides and the bottom of an infiltration trench include the water level in the trench and the hydraulic conductivity of the surrounding native soils a few studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of infiltration trenches considering both the sidewall and bottom infiltration e g duchene et al 1994 browne et al 2008 freni et al 2009 chahar et al 2011 lee et al 2014 in design analyses soils underneath and closely beside an infiltration trench may be assumed to be always saturated the infiltration rate can thus be assumed to be equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soils chahar et al 2011 as soils are actually not saturated all the time during a storm assuming infiltration rate as a constant equalling the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soils may result in a slight underestimation of the amount of infiltration chahar et al 2011 in design analyses or for design purposes however this assumption is widely accepted by many jurisdictions and researchers e g schueler and claytor 2000 pdep 2006 trca and cvca 2010 campisano et al 2011 chahar et al 2011 creaco and franchini 2012 in the rest of this section describing all the methods used for the development of analytical stormwater models for infiltration trenches the stochastic description of point rainfall series is introduced first the stochastic water balance equation for infiltration trenches is then presented together with detailed descriptions of inflows and water losses later on after incorporating the concept of effective storage capacity the stochastic water balance equation is analytically solved and based on the solutions the hydrologic performance indices of interest of infiltration trenches are also derived the results of these derivations form the bases of the three analytical stormwater models for infiltration trenches with different operating conditions as summarized at the end of this section 2 2 stochastic representation of rainfall series in order to analyze the statistical rainfall characteristics of a location the observed continuous rainfall series of the location is first separated into individual rainfall events by selecting a minimum inter event time miet hassini and guo 2016 with a suitable miet discrete rainfall events can be obtained and treated as statistically independent of each other adams and papa 2000 each rainfall event and its preceding dry period can be characterized by three characteristics i e rainfall event depth v event duration u and inter event time b or inter arrival time m which is equal to u plus b for many locations exponential probability density functions pdfs were found to fit well the observed frequency distributions of v u b and m adams and papa 2000 restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 exponential pdfs were therefore recommended for use in the design of stormwater management facilities by the u s environmental protection agency u s epa 1986 and have been widely accepted in many other regional studies around the world lee and kim 2018 segarra garcía 2020 shamsudin et al 2014 ursino 2015 zeng et al 2020 these exponential pdfs can be described as 1 f v v ζ exp ζ v v 0 2 f u u λ exp λ u u 0 3 f b b ψ exp ψ b b 0 4 f m m μ exp μ m m 0 where ζ 1 v λ 1 u ψ 1 b and µ 1 m are the distribution parameters in which is the ensemble average operator µ is the arrival rate events per unit time of rainfall events this probabilistic representation of the rainfall conditions of a location of interest was proposed first by eagleson 1978 the sequential occurrence of random rainfall events can also be described stochastically as a marked compound poisson process where individual rainfall events are treated as occurring instantaneously milly 1993 laio et al 2001 rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 in this study the point rainfall series is represented as consisting of instantaneous rainfall event jumps occurring in a poisson process with an arrival rate of µ and individual rainfall event depths following an exponential distribution shown in equation 1 2 3 dynamic water balance of infiltration trenches the following dynamic water balance equation of an infiltration trench is used to describe the water level fluctuations in its storage reservoir 5 d s d t i s t q s in equation 5 s ss sm is the dimensionless normalization of ss where ss is the amount of water held in the trench at time t expressed as depth of water mm over the trench surface area and sm is the storage capacity of the infiltration trench also expressed in depth of water mm over the trench surface area s is therefore the fraction of this storage capacity occupied by water at time t it is referred to as the trench s degree of saturation hereafter i s t is the net inflow rate to the trench expressed in the unit of dimensionless depth of water over the trench surface area or fractions of the total storage depth in the trench per unit time q s is the water loss rate from the trench also expressed in the unit of dimensionless depth of water over the trench surface area per unit time i s t and q s are both functions of s because how high the water level is inside the trench affects both the inflow and water loss rates q s is a function of s only because the daily and seasonal variations of evapotranspiration and infiltration losses from an infiltration trench due purely to the change in climate or underlying soil conditions are not considered the net inflow rate is also a function of time because rainfall may occur at any time and the exact rainfall amount is random equation 5 is an adaptation of the water balance equation used by rodriguez iturbe et al 1991 laio et al 2001 and rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 in studying soil moisture dynamics 2 3 1 net inflow rate an infiltration trench system includes the infiltration trench itself and its adjacent runoff contributing catchment the total inflow into the infiltration trench consists of the runoff generated from the adjacent catchment and the direct rainfall falling onto the trench surface in estimating runoff generated from the contributing catchment the catchment can be characterized as having a runoff coefficient ϕ dimensionless may be viewed as the fraction of the catchment that contributes runoff and depression storage sdc which is expressed as depth mm of water over the catchment area only when the input rainfall event depth exceeds sdc runoff will be generated from the catchment and the amount of runoff generated from the catchment is equal to ϕac v sdc where ac is the area of the catchment when the input rainfall event depth is less than or equal to sdc the runoff generated from the catchment is equal to zero unlike the contributing catchment rainfall falling directly onto the trench surface is 100 transformed to inflows into the trench so the trench surface may be viewed as another catchment with runoff coefficient equaling to 1 and zero depression storage denoting the trench surface bottom area as ab the ratio between the catchment area and the trench surface area is denoted as ra ac ab to simplify the calculations of the total inflow into the trench as a result of a rainfall event the trench surface and the catchment area is viewed as a lumped catchment area with a depression storage of sd which is the area weighted depression storage of the contributing catchment sdc and the trench surface zero the area weighted average depression storage sd can thus be estimated as s d 1 a b 0 ϕ a c s dc 1 a b ϕ a c ϕ r a s dc ϕ r a 1 after satisfying the depression storage loss sd the net total area that converts 100 of the remaining input rainfall into inflows is ab ϕac which is 1 ϕra times of the trench surface area the total volume of inflow into the trench as a result of a rainfall event with rainfall depth v can therefore be summarized as 6 v i 0 v s d 1 ϕ r a v s d v s d in equation 6 the total inflow volume vi is expressed in the unit of depth mm of water over the trench surface area that is why v sd is multiplied by 1 ϕra equation 6 also illustrates that an inflow event would occur only when the rainfall event depth is greater than sd that is why in using equation 6 vi might be slightly underestimated when v s d however rainfall events with v s d account for a very small portion of the total number of rainfall events and the runoff volume they produce is negligible because sd is usually much smaller than the average rainfall event depth treating v in equation 6 as the realization of a random variable following the exponential distribution described by equation 1 based on the functional relationship between vi and v as expressed in equation 6 and using the derived distribution theory adams and papa 2000 the pdf of v i denoted as f v i v i can be derived as 7 f v i v i d f v i v i d v i ζ ϕ r a 1 exp ζ ϕ r a 1 v i for v i 0 in equation 7 f v i v i is the cumulative distribution function of vi with v i 0 f v i v i can be determined as follows f v i v i p 1 ϕ r a v s d v i v s d 0 v i 1 ϕ r a s d ζ exp ζ v d v s d ζ exp ζ v d v exp ζ s d exp ζ ϕ r a 1 v i equation 7 shows that similar to v vi still follows an exponential distribution with a parameter that is a modification of ζ which is the distribution parameter of rainfall event volume v assuming that the individual inflow events all occur instantaneously the series formed by these individual inflows is comprised of the original input rainfall poisson process with rainfall events having volumes less than or equal to sd removed this new process is referred to as the censored process according to the statistical properties of poisson processes the censored process transformed from the original input rainfall process is still a poisson process cox and milly 1965 with a modified arrival rate of μ where μ μ s d f v v d v μ exp s d ζ the integration included in the calculation for μ ensures that only rainfall events with v sd are left because vi still follows an exponential distribution the new marked poisson process representing the series of inflows into an infiltration trench does not complicate the analytical tractability of the input rainfall poisson process rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 laio et al 2001 dimensionless normalization of some variables of interest are used for simplicity of notation for example the normalized inflow event depth that may flow into the trench s storage reservoir is denoted as r which is equal to vi sm then the pdf of the dimensionless individual inflow event depth r can be expressed as 8 f r r γ exp γ r for r 0 where γ ζ s m 1 ϕ r a is the distribution parameter equaling the inverse of the mean value of r as stated earlier the amount of water stored in the trench at any time when a random inflow event occurs is denoted as ss which is measured in the same unit as sm the storage fraction already occupied at the beginning of a random inflow event is therefore ss sm which is denoted as s and referred to as the trench s degree of saturation subsequent to an inflow event the normalized inflow event depth that is actually retained by the trench s storage reservoir is denoted as y when the normalized inflow event depth r exceeds the normalized storage space that is still available i e 1 s overflow by pass occurs and the actual retained normalized depth from the inflow event y is equal to 1 s otherwise the actual retained rainfall depth from the inflow event equals the normalized inflow event depth r incorporating the fact that r is exponentially distributed as shown in equation 8 the pdf of the normalized net inflow event depth y conditioned on the trench having an initial degree of saturation s denoted as f y s y s can be expressed as 9 f y s y s γ exp γ y exp γ 1 s δ y s 1 for 0 y 1 s where δ is the dirac delta function in equation 9 the probability mass of exp γ 1 s for y 1 s represents the probability that the trench s reservoir is filled by an inflow event given that the trench s initial degree of saturation is s at the start of the rainfall event the sequential number of instantaneous random net inflow event series from time zero to the current time t is denoted as i which takes values of 1 2 3 n t where n t is the total number of net inflow events occurred from time zero to time t the net inflow rate at time t can then be expressed as 10 i s t i 1 n t y i δ t t i where ti with i 1 2 n t is the arrival time of an inflow event in the sequential inflow event series from time zero to time t ti is distributed according to a poisson process with rate μ yi with i 1 2 n t is the sequence of random normalized net inflow event depth with distribution given by equation 9 it is noted here that the same stochastic representation with instantaneous inflow jumps is used in describing rainfall inputs for the study of soil moistures by laio et al 2001 rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 and botter et al 2009 2 3 2 water loss rate during the inter arrival periods of rainfall events inflow retained in an infiltration trench is depleted by evaporation and infiltration into the native soils underneath and surrounding the trench s storage reservoir infiltration may occur through both the bottom and sidewalls of the trench warnaars et al 1999 bergman et al 2011 although occurring at a small rate it was found that evaporation should also be considered in trench design guo and guo 2018a therefore the total water loss from a trench includes the bottom and side infiltration and evaporation of water from its storage reservoir when the amount of water stored in the trench is ss the total water loss rate q ss of an infiltration trench expressed as depth in mm of water over the trench surface area per unit time can be calculated as 11 q s s 0 s s 0 e a α b f b α s f s a s a b 0 s s s m where ab lw is the surface bottom area of a trench with length l and width w a s 2 l w s s is the area of the sidewalls of the trench from which infiltration occurs when water stored in the trench is ss ea is the evaporation rate fb is the infiltration rate from the trench bottom fs is the infiltration rate from the trench s sidewalls αb and αs are the safety factors used to reflect the compaction and clogging effects on the rate of infiltration from respectively the bottom and sides of the trench based on a few monitoring studies it was found that infiltration through the bottom of some trenches may be considered negligible due to clogging emerson and traver 2008 emerson et al 2010 the deposition of sediments would generally result in clogging of a trench with an increase in the time of operation siriwardene et al 2007 as a result the performance of infiltration trenches will gradually decrease as their service time increases revitt et al 2003 to ensure the long term satisfactory performance of infiltration trenches routine and proper inspection and maintenance are necessary to properly consider the effects of clogging and compaction a safety factor may be applied in determining the design infiltration rate of the surrounding soils laboratory experimental approaches to estimating the safety factor for considering clogging effects on infiltration trenches can be found in siriwardence et al 2007 and barraud et al 2014 therefore safety factors αb and αs are used to consider clogging effects in the proposed models since infiltration trenches are usually shallow excavations filled with gravels when there is water inside the trench the rate of evaporation directly from the trench and the rate of infiltration through the bottom of the trench are assumed to be occurring at constant rates not affected by the exact amount of water contained in the trench in equation 11 multiplying αsfs by as ab is to ensure that q ss is expressed in the unit of depth of water over the trench surface area per unit time the normalized water loss rate q s from the infiltration trench can be expressed as 12 q s q s s s m 0 s 0 c 1 s c 2 0 s 1 α b 0 α s 0 c 1 s e a c 1 s m 0 s 1 α b 0 α s 0 e a α b f b s m 0 s 1 α b 0 α s 0 where c 1 2 α s f s l w lw c 2 e a α b f b c 1 s m they are introduced to clearly show how the water loss rate is affected by s and also for simplification of notation in the case where αs equals 0 i e no infiltration occurs through the sides of the trench q s turns to be a constant independent of s considering the impacts of soil clogging and compaction i e using clogging factors αb and αs on the water loss rates of infiltration trenches their operating conditions may be classified into three possibilities 1 infiltration through both the bottom and sides of a trench i e when αb 0 and αs 0 2 infiltration only through the sides of a trench i e when αb 0 and αs 0 and 3 infiltration only through the bottom of a trench i e when αb 0 and αs 0 these possibilities are listed separately in equation 12 for infiltration based bmps other than infiltration trenches one of the above three operating conditions may be used to describe their water loss rates the corresponding three types of stochastic models will be derived and introduced later the water loss rate as a function of s described in equation 12 is a modification and extension of the water loss functions used by laio et al 2001 and rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 for the study of soil moisture dynamics 2 4 effective storage capacity rainfall events are treated as instantaneous pulses in the above stochastic analysis whereas in reality both inflow and water loss occur throughout the duration of a rainfall event instantaneous occurrence of inflows results in instantaneous overflows consequently the estimated overflow volume will be larger than the actual overflow volume this is because the additional storage space resulting from water losses that occur during a rainfall event can actually accommodate more inflows and result in less overflows to avoid the overestimation of overflows an extra storage capacity created by water losses occurring within a rainfall event may be added to the actual physical storage capacity the actual physical storage capacity is denoted as sc hereafter of a trench and the sum may be regarded as the trench s effective storage capacity this effective storage capacity should then be used as sm in all previous representations and calculations fig 1 presents the schematic of an infiltration trench s storage components and related water balance elements similar to other kinds of infiltration based bmps the physical storage provided by an infiltration trench is mainly contributed by its storage reservoir and the shallow depression storage created by the relatively low lying surface of the storage reservoir the total physical storage capacity of a trench sc can therefore be calculated as s c s dt r v d m 1 r v where sdt is the depression storage of the trench expressed in mm rv is the void ratio between the total void volume and the total solid volume of the storage reservoir dm is the depth of the storage reservoir for some other types of infiltration based bmps that are made up of a soil layer in addition to a depression storage layer and a storage layer the additional storage capacity provided by the soil layer can be calculated similarly as the depth of the soil layer multiplied by the soil s porosity the effective storage capacity sm may be estimated by considering an average representative rainfall event with duration u for this event sm may be calculated as 13 s m s c q s s u s c q s s λ where λ 1 u and λ is the distribution parameter for rainfall event duration q s s is the average water loss rate during this representative rainfall event it can be estimated as 14 q s s q 0 q u 2 where q0 and q u are the water loss rates at respectively the beginning and end of the representative rainfall event the water loss rates during a representative rainfall event can be estimated by approximating the water loss rate calculated using equation 11 as a linear function of ss i e q s s k s s where k q s c s c this simplification will only be used to estimate q0 and q u in equation 14 infiltration rates through native soils are usually much lower than the average intensities of rainfall events in addition inflows into a trench includes not only rainfall falling directly onto the trench surface but also runoff from its catchment as a result similar to other infiltration based bmps the typical operation of a trench during a rainfall event is that the trench is filled up quickly during the initial portion of the rainfall event and then the water loss rate from the trench gradually decreases because of the decrease of water contained in the trench if the process of the filling up of the trench is further simplified as occurring instantaneously at the beginning of the representative rainfall event the water loss rate during this event would be an exponential decreasing function of time thus the water loss rate at the beginning of the representative rainfall event q0 can be estimated as q sc while the water loss rate at the end of the representative rainfall event can be estimated as q u q s c exp k u according to equation 14 the average water loss rate can then be estimated as q s s q s c exp k λ q s c 2 substituting this expression of q s s into equation 13 sm can be estimated as 15 s m s c q s c exp q s c λ s c q s c 2 λ the introduction and use of effective storage capacity are for the purpose of improving the accuracy of the simplified stochastic description of the water balance of an infiltration trench previous research on stochastic soil moisture dynamics laio et al 2001 rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 botter et al 2009 verma et al 2011 did not incorporate any similar concepts however as shown later incorporation of the effective storage capacity concept greatly improves the accuracy of the final results 2 5 mathematical solution of the stochastic water balance equation the stochastic water balance shown in equation 5 is driven by a marked poisson process i s t this is similar to the water balance equations of soil moistures studied by laio et al 2001 and rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 as shown in these previous studies the steady state solution for the probability distribution of s from equation 5 can be derived by obtaining the corresponding chapman kolmogorov forward equations first cox and miller 1965 gardiner 2004 the steady state probability distribution of s denoted as h s consists of a discrete atom of probability f0 for s 0 and a continuous pdf f s for s 0 as shown in equation 12 when s increases from 0 to some infinitesimally small value the water loss rate q s jumps from 0 to a finite value this discontinuity of the water loss rate function q s at s 0 makes it possible for the trench to become and remain empty for some periods of time and thus results in the atom of probability f0 for s 0 as shown in detail by rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 the general solutions of f s and f 0 can be expressed as 16 f s c 3 q s exp γ s μ 0 s 1 q z d z for 0 s 1 17 f 0 c 3 μ for s 0 where c 3 is the normalization constant needed to satisfy the requirement that the total probability mass must equal one and z is the dummy variable of integration more details about the above solution processes can be found in the appendix explicit expressions of f s and f0 can be derived separately for the two possible q s cases with αs 0 or αs 0 when αs 0 q s is a linear increasing function of s by carrying out the integration in equation 16 for q s cases with αs 0 f s and f0 were found to be 18 f s c 3 c 4 exp γ s c 2 s c 2 μ c 1 1 for 0 s 1 19 f 0 c 3 μ for s 0 in equation 18 the constant c 4 c 2 μ c 1 exp γ c 2 c 1 is introduced to simplify notation in order to satisfy the requirement that 0 1 h s d s 1 c 3 was determined to be c 3 1 μ c 4 c 5 γ μ c 1 1 where c 5 γ μ c 1 γ 1 c 2 γ μ c 1 γ c 2 and γ represents the incomplete gamma function which is defined as γ a x 0 x z a 1 exp z d z the cumulative distribution function cdf of s h s can be derived as 20 h s f 0 0 s f s d s c 3 μ c 3 c 4 γ μ c 1 γ μ c 1 γ s c 2 γ μ c 1 γ c 2 for 0 s 1 when αs 0 q s is no longer a linear increasing function of s but remains constant for s 0 the derivation of f s and f0 is therefore different from the derivations for cases with αs 0 solution of the stochastic balance equation with a constant q s is known as the takács problem takács 1955 described in detail by cox and miller 1965 this constant water loss function q s for an infiltration trench has mathematically the same format as that for a combined sewer overflow detention tank with a constant outflow rate wang and guo 2018 solutions of a similar stochastic equation describing soil water balances was found by milly 1993 adapting from the solutions provided in these earlier studies f0 f s and h s for an infiltration trench with a constant water loss rate i e αs 0 can be expressed as follows 21 f 0 1 γ 1 μ η γ μ η γ μ η exp μ η γ γ μ η γ for s 0 22 f s γ γ 1 μ η γ μ η γ exp μ η γ γ η μ exp μ η γ s μ η γ for 0 s 1 23 h s γ s 1 γ 1 μ η γ μ η exp μ η γ s γ μ η exp μ η γ γ μ η γ where η g sm and g ea αb fb more detailed processes for obtaining equations 21 through 23 are provided in wang and guo 2018 which also demonstrates why for systems where μ η γ and μ η γ the solutions are different although the form of equations 21 through 23 used for infiltration trenches with a constant water loss rate is the same as those used in wang and guo 2018 for detention tanks the infiltration models used here describing the water loss functions contain more design variables than those contained in wang and guo 2018 2 6 estimation of average degree of saturation and average runoff capture efficiency the long term average amount of water stored in the trench s s in mm of water over the trench surface area can be expressed as s s s s c where s is the ensemble average degree of saturation and can be calculated as s 0 1 s h s d s the long term average water balance of an infiltration trench can be expressed as r q ω where r μ 0 r f r r d r is the normalized mean inflow rate into the trench q 0 1 q s h s d s is the normalized mean water loss rate from the trench and ω is the normalized mean overflow rate from the trench the average runoff capture efficiency of a trench er can be calculated as the ratio between the normalized mean long term average water loss rate and the normalized mean long term inflow rate i e e r q r for q s cases with αs 0 s and er were found to be 24 s c 3 c 4 c 6 c 7 γ c 2 c 5 where c 6 γ 1 μ c 1 c 7 γ μ c 1 1 γ 1 c 2 γ μ c 1 1 γ c 2 and 25 e r c 1 c 3 c 4 c 6 c 7 γ μ 1 for q s cases with αs 0

and 27 the long term average runoff capture efficiency provided by a trench can be easily calculated in addition equations 24 and 26 can be used to analytically determine the long term average amount of water stored in a trench while equations 18 through 23 can be used to quantify the chances of having different water levels in a trench the collection of these closed form analytical equations is referred to as the analytical stormwater model asm for infiltration trenches 2 7 three possible operating conditions equation 12 is used to represent three possible operating infiltration conditions the resulting asms are referred to as asm i for the case with αb 0 and αs 0 asm ii for the case with αb 0 and αs 0 and asm iii for the case with αb 0 but αs 0 for asm i equations 18 through 20 24 and 25 themselves with αb and αs both greater than zero can be used in the analysis of the hydrologic performance of infiltration trenches or other types of infiltration based bmps with infiltration through both their bottoms and sides asm ii which considers only infiltration from the sides of a trench is obtained by setting the bottom clogging factor αb 0 in equation 12 analytical equations for asm ii are the same as for asm i except that c 2 is simplified in asm ii since αb 0 asm iii which considers infiltration only through the bottom of a trench is obtained by setting the side clogging factor αs 0 the water loss rate function of asm iii is shown in equation 12 with αs 0 the collection of equations 21 through 23 26 and 27 themselves with αb 0 but αs 0 are used in asm iii for the design and analysis of infiltration trenches in addition to infiltration trenches these equations can also be used for infiltration basins and bioretention cells where infiltration through the bottom is the most predominant 3 example study areas and input data clearly with changes made to the definitions of some of the variables and parameters the above derived asms can be used for many different types of infiltration based bmps however for clarity in explanation the following example and verification studies still focus on infiltration trenches the storm water management model swmm is a widely used tool for modelling the performance of stormwater best management practices avellaneda et al 2017 to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed asms a set of continuous swmm u s epa version 5 1 rossman 2015 simulations were performed for urban catchments with different types of soils loam sandy loam and sand and different infiltration conditions asm i ii and iii hypothetical catchments were assumed to be located in two climatically different locations in the u s jackson mississippi with a humid climate and billings montana with an arid climate in the swmm simulations long term hourly rainfall records of jackson and billings obtained from the national climatic data center ncdc of the u s are used as input rainfall series and their rainfall statistics are shown in table 1 the rainfall event characteristics in table 1 are required for the use of asms the accuracy of the asms are examined by comparing their results with those from swmm continuous simulations the long term average runoff capture efficiency determined by swmm simulations is calculated as v swmm o swmm v swmm where vswmm and oswmm are respectively the total runoff volume and total overflow volume determined from swmm continuous simulation results the values of parameters used in the swmm simulations are listed in table 2 ϕ is assumed to be 1 for the contributing catchments of infiltration trenches in the case studies to simplify the illustration of the application and verification of asms fb and fs are treated as equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils which are 6 13 and 30 mm h for loam sandy loam and sandy soils respectively guo and gao 2016 both αb and αs are assumed to be 0 8 it should be noted that the swmm lid module is not capable of simulating infiltration from the sides of trenches as an alternative we used a storage unit with a total storage capacity of sc to represent a trench the outflow rate of this storage unit is controlled by an orifice with a specified rating curve the same as what is described by equation 12 this way outflows from this storage unit are equivalent to the water losses from infiltration trenches the inflows collected by the storage unit are from two subcatchments one representing the adjacent contributing catchment area and the other representing the trench surface area where rainfall falls directly 4 verification of the analytical stormwater models 4 1 overall accuracy of the analytical stormwater models using equation 15 to estimate sm three different asms were developed for infiltration trenches with different infiltration conditions to verify the accuracy of asms for all possible field conditions a comprehensive set of hypothetical cases with different characteristics are simulated by swmm and calculated using asms for each specific soil type and location 32 cases representing a combination of two different values of ra 10 and 50 and 16 different values of dm 50 100 200 1500 mm were simulated in addition 24 cases formed by a combination of two different values of dm 500 and 1000 mm and 12 different values of ra 1 2 5 5 10 50 for one specific soil type and location were also simulated two locations jackson and billings and three different soil types loam sandy loam and sand are considered for all the above described combinations resulting in a total of 324 cases for each asm models therefore for the verification of the three asm models a total of 972 cases were simulated by swmm and compared with asm results for each of these three asms their overall performance for 324 cases are presented in fig 2 treating the continuous simulation results of swmm as observed data root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and correlation coefficient cc between observed and asm model results can all be calculated in reality swmm models themselves would only provide accurate results when they are properly calibrated against observed data in this study since swmm models do not require the simplifications needed by the asms given enough data for calibration it is assumed that the swmm models can be properly calibrated and provide very accurate results the swmm models that were set up here for hypothetical cases are treated as based on calibrated parameter values and therefore provide results close to measurements as shown in fig 2 the values of nse and cc are very close to 1 and the values for rmse are close to 0 for all the three asms these statistical indices demonstrate that asm results resemble well swmm continuous simulation results for a wide range of possible operating conditions some of the modeled extreme operating conditions may not be recommended for infiltration trenches but they are possible or recommended for other types of infiltration based bmps including a wide range of cases in this verification study helps in illustrating that the asms are reliable for estimating the runoff capture efficiencies of almost all types of infiltration based bmps 4 2 effects of storage reservoir depth soil types and area ratios the depth of the storage reservoir dm determines the storage capacity of a trench which affects directly the overflow volumes the effects of dm on runoff capture efficiencies were investigated given an area ratio ra 10 a total of 48 cases for three soil types loam sandy loam and sand using asm i at jackson were simulated comparison between the asm and swmm results is presented in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the runoff capture efficiency increases when dm increases higher runoff capture efficiencies were achieved for soil types with greater infiltration capacities the largest absolute relative difference between asm and swmm results is 17 7 which is from the case with loam soil when dm is equal to 50 mm this is an extremely small dm value usually not selected for design close agreement between the two models can be observed from fig 3 generally the greater resemblance between asm and swmm results is observed when dm is larger this is because less overflows would occur when the trench has a larger storage capacity and as a result errors in the overestimation of overflows caused by the assumption of instantaneous inflows get smaller for an infiltration trench with a specific size the area ratio ra determines the contributing catchment area and therefore the inflow volume asm ii and simulation results are presented for two values of dm i e 500 and 1000 mm for demonstration purposes for each value of dm a total of 24 cases for a combination of two soil types loam and sand and 12 area ratios ra 1 2 5 5 10 50 at billings were simulated and plotted in fig 4 the decreasing curves in fig 4 show that runoff capture efficiency decreases with an increase of the area ratio because more runoff will be generated which would cause more overflows in cases with the same soil type and a same area ratio ra larger runoff capture efficiencies will be achieved when dm is larger at billings due to the larger storage capacity to retain more inflows and result in less overflows the largest absolute relative difference between asm and swmm is 10 0 which is from the case with loam soil when dm is equal to 1000 mm and ra approaches 30 overall the asm results agree well with swmm results for all 48 cases as shown in fig 4 4 3 effects of climate conditions two representative climatic conditions i e humid jackson and arid billings were simulated effects of climate conditions on runoff capture efficiency can be analyzed from the plotted er versus dm and ra curves in fig 5 for sandy loam soils with a dm of 500 mm 24 cases with different values of ra obtained from asm iii at the two locations were simulated for the same dm and ra the runoff capture efficiency obtained at billings is generally larger than that at jackson when ra is small taking ra 2 5 at jackson and ra 10 at billings as examples the runoff capture efficiencies are very close to 1 er 0 9 indicating that runoff contributed from catchments with such area ratios will be almost completely captured by the infiltration trenches as ra increases er decreases and finally stabilizes at about 0 21 at jackson and 0 43 at billings respectively when ra approaches 50 in addition when the soil type is sand and ra equals 10 asm ii results for 32 cases with various dm values were compared with swmm results and also shown in fig 5 similar conclusions of the effects of climatic conditions can also be reached the runoff capture efficiency of billings increases sharply from 0 25 to 0 92 as dm increases from 50 to 600 mm thereafter it rises slowly to 0 99 and stays at 0 99 when dm exceeds 1200 mm for jackson a smooth increasing trend of the runoff capture efficiency from 0 10 to 0 93 as dm goes up from 50 to 1500 mm is clear good agreements can also be observed in fig 5 which demonstrates again the accuracy of asms ii and iii 4 4 additional analysis in addition to runoff capture efficiency asms can provide many other useful performance indicators which cannot be directly provided by continuous simulation models example indicators may include the chance of having an empty trench and the long term average water level inside a trench the chance of having an empty trench or equivalently the fraction of time when the trench is empty is equal to the probability of having s 0 which is denoted as f0 and can be directly calculated using equation 19 or 21 the long term average water level inside a trench is simply the average degree of saturation s multiplied by dm in fact the pdf of s f s and the cumulative distribution function h s provide even more detailed information about the wetness that a trench experiences in its operation together they help designers gain a better understanding of the wetness characteristics varying with soil types climate conditions land use conditions and storage capacity using equations 18 26 asms can easily provide this kind of useful information example results are presented in fig 6 using asm i for jackson with dm 1000 mm and ra 10 probability distributions of s and the average degree of saturation s varying with three soil types were obtained and plotted in fig 6a and 6b for sandy loam soils at jackson and billings taking dm 500 mm as an example fig 6c and 6d show the analytical results of the probability distributions of s and s obtained by using asm ii it is worth noting that s are very small and f0 are quite high for all cases this demonstrates that infiltration trenches as usually designed at these two locations are indeed capable of infiltrating captured runoff and are usually in a state of being almost empty when a rainfall event randomly occurs fig 6 also shows that sandy soils and billings climate result in higher chances of having empty trenches i e higher f0 values as area ratio increases the chance of having empty trenches decreases and gradually stabilizes when ra approaches 50 these additional analysis results may not seem to be that useful for infiltration trenches but for infiltration basins and bioretention systems where the growing conditions of plants inside the facilities are also a major concern these additional results will be very helpful 5 concluding remarks in this paper three analytical stormwater models asms considering different operating conditions of infiltration based stormwater best management practices bmps were developed runoff capture efficiency chance of having empty facilities and the average water content inside a facility can all be analytically determined using the closed form equations comprising the asms effects of soil types area ratios sizes of storage reservoirs and climate conditions on the performance of infiltration facilities can all be easily and systematically investigated using these asms the accuracy of asms were verified by comparing their results with swmm continuous simulation results the comparisons demonstrate that the asms can provide reliable and accurate results for almost all possible design configurations as a useful and convenient alternative to continuous simulation models the proposed asms are recommended for use in the planning design and evaluation of the infiltration based bmps with any of the three possible operating conditions the usefulness and advantages of applying asms in practical design analysis which follows jurisdictional design guidelines will be studied in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

f0 f s and h s equation 5 is a stochastic differential equation since it is driven by a marked poisson process i e the inflow into the trench i s t the solution for the probability distribution of s from equation 5 can be derived by obtaining the corresponding chapman kolmogorov forward equations first botter et al 2009 cox and miller 1965 gardiner 2004 rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 from the start of operation of a trench the probability distribution of s denoted as h s t changes with time t and consists of a discrete atom of probability f0 t for s 0 and a continuous pdf f s t for s 0 due to the discontinuity of the normalized water loss rate function q s at s 0 shown in equation 11 the general form of the temporal evolution of f s t and f0 t as derived by rodriguez iturbe and proporato 2004 can be expressed as a1 f s t t s f s t q s μ f s t μ 0 s f z t p y s s z z d z μ f 0 t f y s s 0 for 0 s 1 a2 d f 0 t d t μ f 0 t q 0 f 0 t for s 0 where f y s s z z and f y s s 0 are both the conditional probability distributions of inflows to a trench as expressed in equation 9 0 is a value infinitesimally larger than zero f 0 t lim s 0 f s t z is the dummy variable of integration as the operation time continues the infiltration trench system will eventually reach a steady state where the probability distribution of s will remain the same and does not change with time any more the steady state solutions of f s t and f0 t can be obtained by letting t approach infinity in equations a1 and a2 theoretically it would take an infinitely long time for the system to reach a steady state but a state fairly close to the steady state would be reached after perhaps a few months of operation and this approximate steady state is the only interest for the planning and design of infiltration trenches the steady state atom of probability for s 0 and the continuous pdf for s 0 are denoted as f0 and f s respectively by setting t to approach infinity in equations a1 and a2 while replacing f y s with the expressions shown in equation 9 the two equations governing f s and f0 were obtained to be a3 d d s f s q s μ f s μ 0 s f z γ e γ s z δ s 1 e γ 1 z d z μ f 0 γ e γ s

and botter et al 2009 provided the general solutions of equations a3 and a4 which are shown in equations 16 and 17 respectively 
5248,previous studies show that the flow velocity profile is s shaped for low submergence flows in gravel bed streams as a consequence the power or logarithmic flow resistance equations cannot be theoretically deduced for a low submergence flow in this study the mixing layer analogy in an accurate and innovative way is applied to express the flow resistance in gravel bed streams laboratory experiments over 12 uniform gravel bed runs the relative submerged height ranging from 2 6 to 4 6 are used to determine the physical rationality and accuracy of the analogy that statistical flow turbulent properties are closer to typical values in the mixing layer than in the surface layer the key parameters of shear strength l s applied by an incomplete self similarity analysis for the dimensionless groups and difference coefficient c u defined as the ratio of velocity at the reference level to shear velocity deduced by the simplified darcy forchheimer brinkman equation are expressed and tested using experimental data the new approach is further underpinned by using 104 field measured reaches located in 40 different natural streams which adds to the more widely ranged field data with the relative submerged height ranging from 0 9 to 20 the analysis shows that the flow layer subdivisions theoretical approach based on the multivariable mixing layer analogy and optimized katul law characterized by the lowest root mean square error relative error and closest 1 nash sutcliffe index has potential in future research keywords flow resistance mixing layer flow shallow flow gravel bed stream incomplete self similarity large scale roughness 1 introduction flow resistance is fundamental for controlling flow hydraulics and fluvial geomorphology in man made channels or natural streams it contributes to the properties of the average velocity water level and other related turbulent variables quantifying the flow resistance in gravel bed streams is of significant importance from several points of view including flood risk and debris flow prediction bed material transport benthic habitat restoration and anticipation of the evolved mountainous landscapes nevertheless the appropriate quantitative evaluation of gravel bed resistance still has unsolved problem awaiting clarification these problems include 1 the gravel bed roughness cannot be effectively characterized by a single percentile of particle size distribution nikora et al 1998 canovaro et al 2007 2 the intermittent and energetic turbulence coherent structures within and just above large roughness elements have a great influence 3 the behavior of different proportions of the dominant sources of skin friction for shear stresses and form drag for pressure forces as relative submergence decreases is not known cheng 2014 powell 2014 what is needed is a method to predict flow resistance from readily observable and time invariant hydraulic properties classical resistance coefficients for open channel flows are the chezy c manning s n and the darcy weisbach friction factor f a law defining the relationship between the flow resistance coefficient and the hydraulic variables is called the flow resistance equation however less attention has been paid to the uniform flow of large scale roughness in gravel bed streams in which the bed particle size equals the uniform flow depth h above gravel bed ferro 2003 for studying the relationship between the flow resistance and hydraulic properties in gravel bed channels some relative inundation criteria for the main process of dividing flow resistance have been proposed and applied in the field bathurst 1982 used d 50 or d 84 in which the particle size of 50 or 84 percent of the material is finer to propose the following classifications with large scale roughness defined as h d 50 2 or h d 84 1 2 transition defined as 2 h d 50 7 5 or 1 2 h d 84 4 and small scale roughness as h d 50 7 5 or h d 84 4 bray and davar 1987 evaluated flow resistance by defining large scale roughness for jet and wake as h d 50 3 transition to large scale as 3 h d 50 10 transition to small scale as 10 h d 50 20 and small scale roughness shear flow as h d 50 20 lawrence 1997 defined the inundation ratio with the same relative submergence rate as λ h k where h denotes the mean uniform flow depth and k is the characteristic roughness scale for the surface in order to distinguish three flow regimes representing large scale roughness as λ 1 transition as 1 λ 10 and small scale roughness as λ 10 ferguson 2007 proposed a non dimensional hydraulic geometry equation with two flow regimes defining large scale roughness shallow flow as h d 84 4 and small scale roughness deep flow as h d 84 4 low relative submergence of open channel flow where h d 84 4 is commonly found in mountainous areas with high gradients and seasonal high flow rates such as china southeast and the pacific northwest this channel bed is characterized by a spatially disorganized pattern of cobbles and boulders which have high resistance in comparison with alluvial rivers powell 2014 this is related to resistance to the shape of the channel and the movement of the sediment particles lamb et al 2017a b as observed in previous studies the velocity distribution profile for a large scale roughness condition is s shaped ferro and baiamonte 1994 ferro and pecoraro 2000 katul et al 2002 rickenmann and recking 2011 ferro and porto 2018a b surface flow velocity deviate from logarithmic law and higher than near bed velocity dominated by the loss of flow momentum mainly due to the resistance around the particles near the river bed canovaro et al 2007 based on a series of accurate flume experiments wang et al 2015 obtain the occurrence conditions of the s shaped velocity distribution profile if the roughness height hydraulic radius ratio d 84 r froude number fr u gh and u is the mean uniform flow velocity of cross section and reynolds number re ur υ and υ is the kinematic viscosity are 0 15 0 47 and 60 000 respectively the velocity and stress of near bed flow regime are strongly affected by blockage and form drag induced by the roughness hence no large scale boundary layer turbulence is developed and the large roughness element vortices dominated by the turbulence both within and above the particles resemble turbulence vegetation canopies with coherent eddies nepf 2012a the preliminary interpretation for this shape of the velocity profile is that it is dependent on the bed elements which act individually to produce a total resistance based mainly on the sum of their profile drags ferro and porto 2018a b in particular the basis of flow resistance equations applicable to low gradient rivers with sandy and small scale roughness are traditionally formed by the classical analyses of one dimensional pipe flow such as boundary layers or a logarithmic velocity distribution equation however shallow flow resistance in open channel with large scale roughness estimation becomes more complicated and the equations using classical analyses are not efficient smith et al 2007 this work is motivated by the mixing layer theory for flow resistance originally developed for canopy turbulence applied by katul et al 2002 which is indirectly related to building a canopy turbulence bridge between the gravel bed and the mixed layer theory however the analogy is accurate only if the values of the statistical flow properties in gravel bed streams of shallow flow turbulence are closer to standard values in a mixing layer than a surface layer therefore the basic theme of this paper is to demonstrate the analogy between the gravel bed shallow streams and the mixing layer flow first the mixing layer theory from hydrodynamic mechanism presented by paupach 1996 and finnigan 2000 is briefly reviewed and the resultant flow resistance equations of large scale roughness condition listed second to illustrate the reasonability and accuracy of the mixing layer analogy flume experiments of gravel bed are conducted based on statistical flow properties with different gravel density and relative submergence third from this work a new flow resistance equation based on the multivariable mixing layer analogy rather than the standard rough wall boundary layer theory is found by introducing the reynolds number froude number shear stress and tests for an undetermined constant using laboratory experimental data 2 6 h k s 4 6 finally a wider range of field data in different natural gravel bed streams 0 9 h k s 20 are used to analyze the applicability and accuracy of flow resistance equations 2 theories 2 1 flow resistance three classical relationships linking velocity and flow resistance which are the most widely applied powell 2014 are the previously mentioned chezy manning and darcy weisbach equations given by 1 u c r s f 1 n r 2 3 s f 1 2 8 g r s f f where r is the hydraulic radius sf is the friction slope usually approximated by water surface or channel slope s g is gravitational acceleration and c m1 2s 1 n m 1 3s and f dimensionless are the chezy coefficient manning coefficient and darcy weisbach friction factor respectively it should be noted that f is a dimensionless parameter so that it can easily be generalized and physically interpreted in comparison to other coefficients since the shear velocity u τ 0 ρ where τ 0 is the bottom shear stress per unit bed area and ρ is water density reflects the shear of flow layers the ratio u u is applied widely to parameterize flow resistance dividing eq 1 by the shear velocity u we obtain 2 u u c g 1 2 r 1 6 n g 1 2 8 f applying the prandlt karman theory of turbulence to a circular and rectangular wide cross section the velocity profile is approximated by the logarithmic equation by integrating the logarithmic velocity profile over the cross section the mean velocity is deduced as 3 u u 1 k ln r k s where k s denotes grain size roughness height characterized by a single percentile of the particle size distribution and k denotes von karman s constant with a constant value of 0 4 by substituting eq 3 into the dimensionless eq 2 the flow resistance equations can be used extensively in deep open channel by measuring the roughness height and hydraulic radius in addition to the previous logarithmic function the simple power law and semi logarithmic approximation approaches are recognized as early as 1880 and have been widely used katul et al 2002 powell 2014 cheng 2017 in the following forms 4 u u n r k s 1 6 5 u u a b log r k s where a b and n are constants found from fitting data the value of n is 6 7 from the manning stricker formula and a and b are 6 25 and 2 5 respectively in the keulegan formula the deep flow conditions as so defined have been used successfully and reported in various scientific studies however the flow resistance prediction using these equations have distinctly deviated from measurement data in shallow stream conditions with large scale roughness ferguson 2007 lamb et al 2017a ferro and porto 2018a b the primary reason is that this flow energy dissipation is influenced by the shape arrangement and concentration of surface roughness elements as well as additional form resistance effects the functions could not be fit to the s shape of the velocity profile when the near bed velocity is significantly lower than the near surface velocity as caused by the protrusion of riverbed particles which occurs in intermediate and large scale roughness conditions ferro 2018 mendicino and colosimo 2019 in recent years several useful flow resistance laws for large scale roughness conditions have been developed by modifying the logarithmic and power laws based on the colebrook white type equation hey 1979 proposed a relationship in gravel bed rivers for h d 84 0 3 as following 6 8 f 6 25 5 75 log r 3 5 d 84 smart et al 2002 currently describes bed roughness for large scale conditions by utilizing the volumetric hydraulic radius r v volume of water per unit area of bed and the standard deviation of the bed surface elevation d z they showed that the r v d z exponent of the power law flow resistance equations is enlarged from 1 6 to 1 2 with the increase in relative submergence the equations have the forms 7a 8 f c r v d z 0 5 d x d z 0 5 d z r v 0 03 7b 8 f c r v d z 1 25 d x d z 0 5 d z r v 0 03 where d x and d y are the roughness elements in the stream wise and cross stream dimensions respectively ferguson 2007 used a simple two way cut to express 8 f a 1 r d 1 6 in deep flows and 8 f a 2 r d in shallow flows where a 1 7 8 and a 2 1 4 are empirical coefficients integrating the effects of river bed form and sediment skin friction f is obtained as a sum of two components 8 8 f a 1 a 2 r d 84 a 1 2 a 1 2 r d 84 5 3 using the similar ferguson approach with discharge as input rickenmann and recking 2011 also proposed new dimensionless variables and a new equation that performs the best in comparison to eq 8 this new form is 9 8 f 4 416 r d 84 1 904 1 r 1 283 d 84 1 618 1 083 considering contracted

applied for large scale roughness conditions 0 21 h d 84 1 69 due to the inaccuracy to calculate the flow resistance by using a logarithmic law for shallow flows with large scale roughness some alternative approaches for predicting flow resistance in shallow flows have been sought recently nikora et al 2001 2004 use novel applications to develop the new flow resistance theory in shallow flows from the navier stokes equations in the flow type over partially inundated rough bed flows the equation form for 0 6 h d 90 5 is 13 8 f c m h δ where the range of chezy s coefficient c is between 3 and 7 from experimental data the parameter m depends on roughness geometry and is weakly dependent on h and approximately a constant 0 6 and the thickness δ is defined as the appropriate maximum size following nikora s approach lamb et al 2017 used a hybrid eddy viscosity model for steep streams which contains the relationship among the shear strength water level above the bed and riverbed roughness also katul et al 2002 directly used the mixing layer analogy of canopy turbulence for the inflectional velocity profile without verification to gravel bed and derived an equation

equation 10 and 12 are absent due to lack of flow parameters and eq 13 is also short of fitting c clearly despite that it can be seen that all of the equations are close for small scale roughness condition h d 84 4 but enormous differences exist among the trend of these equations for the large scale roughness condition 0 1 h d 84 4 2 2 the mixing layer theory the ideal mixing layer is the free shear flow formed by two coflowing streams with different densities or velocities downstream of a splitter plate fig 2 which is characterized by an internal velocity gradient at an inlet section and independent evolution of fixed boundaries finnigan 2000 sukhodolova and sukhodolov 2012a b the theory is widely applicable in the emerging fields of atmospheric sciences aeromechanics environmental techniques and chemical manufacturing there are two characteristic velocities u c u 1 u 2 2 and δ u u 2 u 1 where u 1 and u 2 are the low and high velocities respectively the depth of the mixing layer is expressed by the vorticity thickness δ w δ u d u d z max z x z 0 x where z x denotes flow height perpendicular to the flow and z 0 is a virtual origin as a result of a simple geometrical relationship between these length scales the momentum thickness δ m 1 4 u u c δ u 2 is typically to δ w 2 π in connection with the shape of velocity distribution profile raupach et al 1996 two decades ago paupach proposed several observed flow structure and turbulence properties in the fully developed self preserving mixing layer flow as illustrated in fig 3 there is a strong inflection in the velocity distribution profile at the centerline of a splitter plate fig 3a and isolated symmetric peaks in the reynolds shear stress u w and the velocity standard deviations σ u u 2 1 2 and σ w w 2 1

for the mixing layer as max uw 1 2 the uw correlation coefficient as r uw uw σ u σ w the terms of the turbulent kinetic energy budget are shown as strong turbulent transport fig 3c and given by brunet and collineau 1994 the turbulent energy equation is an important equation in characterizing turbulent energy exchange using the following terms raupach et al 1996 15 e 2 t p s p w p b t t t p ε where e 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 2 is the turbulent kinetic energy tke budget the terms p s p w and p b are the shear wake and buoyant production respectively while t t and t p are the turbulent and pressure transport and ε denotes dissipation these terms of the tke budget have conventional forms there are anti symmetric double peaks in the plot of u and w skewness sk u and sk w fig 3d the inverse turbulent prandtl number is pr t 1 k h k m approximately close to 2 in a mixing layer fig 3d in which k m uw u z and k h wt t z are the eddy diffusivities for momentum and heat respectively the variables t and t denote mean and fluctuating potential temperatures respectively classical linear hydrodynamics stability theory hst has been applied for initially analyzing the mixing layer evolution from experimental and numerical simulation results michalke 1964 this work takes notice of the stability properties downstream in a plane shear flow with a strong inflection point in the velocity profile distribution resembled by fig 3a the inflected velocity profile of the inviscid mixing layer is affected unstably by small perturbations and transverse unstable modes of kelvin helmholtz kh instability dominate the vertical transport at the interface integration of the rayleigh equation simplified to the case of the unstable mixing layer calculated an approximately hyperbolic tangent function for the unperturbed mean velocity profile given by 16 u z u s 1 tanh z z c l s where u z is defined as the average velocity at z and u z d u d z velocity differential δ u 2 u s u 2 u 1 and the shear strength l s is the strength of the shear flow at the inflection point described by the length scale l s u z u z δ w 2 linking to the roller type vortices thickness and z c is the centerline position of the mixing layer 3 laboratory experimental setup laboratory experiments are conducted in a 16 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 4 m high rectangular flume with a large slope s 2 5 at the state key lab of hydraulics and mountain river engineering in sichuan university across a range of water discharge with 10 l s q 60 l s the flume experimental configuration is shown in fig 4 the flow is tripped by a rectangular weir with a wide top to enter the flume generating a steady uniform flow in open channel and rapidly dissipating inflow turbulence the model rough gravel bed is located in the middle of flume and is 4 0 m long with the velocity distribution is measured uniformly along the vertical direction distributed at each cross section a one meter long rough surface constituted by uniform rubble is placed in the front and back of the model rough gravel bed to avoid large scale disturbance in the reach under investigation for the coordinate frame employed the x axis is the principal axis of the flume positive in the flow direction the z axis is vertical normal to the flume floor and oriented upwards the y axis is normal to the x z plane and forms together with the other two axes a right handed coordinate system the origin is set 0 at the front of the model rough gravel bed y 0 in the lateral center of the flume and z 0 at the bottom of the model rough gravel bed in the model of rough gravel bed reach the different planimetric arrangements of the gravel bed are set up characterized by the diameter d 50 of 4 0 cm uniform pebbles circular ping pong balls are used in this study experiments are carried out on different flow discharge and pebble particle size the transversal distance of pebbles refers to a streamwise sequence of the transversal large roughness scale bed placed along the x axis the spacing s is n times that of pebble diameter and varied from 0 0 to 28 0 cm which reflects changes in bed pebble spatial density based on changes in spacing the pebble spatial density λ is defined as the ratio between the model rough gravel bed reach volumes occupied by the gravel elements in the lower layer v g and the total volume v w of the lower layer therefore λ can be defined as follows 17 λ v g v w π n d 50 2 6 b l π 6 d 50 s d 50 where n is the number of gravel elements arranged on the model rough gravel bed reach and b and l are the width and length of the model rough gravel bed reach respectively the planimetric arrangements of the rough elements are shown in fig 5 notwithstanding that the influence on the natural macro roughness pattern is quantitatively different from flume experiments some common behavior between natural streams and regular roughness geometry can be observed in the flume experiments canovaro et al 2007 all the experiments are carried out in the case of fixed bed and uniform steady flow conditions the flow velocities for each of the flow scenarios are measured at the midline between the adjacent transversal gravel elements which are illustrated in fig 5 by red dashed line the measurement separation distance is 1 0 cm within regions above the flume bottom to obtain the detailed velocity profile of each vertical monitoring line about 45 s records are taken using a down looking three dimensional acoustic doppler velocimeter adv 50 hz manufactured by sontek incorporated company to capture the near surface and shear flow region the number of measurements of the velocity at the monitoring point is 3000 the instrument is set to screen out the data points with the correlation coefficient above 70 and data with a confidence are used higher than 90 as the testing points for next analysis twelve scenarios are characterized by the flow depth h and flow discharge q as detailed in table 1 and each run is measured under uniform flow with the liquid discharges maintained constant in table 1 the mean velocity of cross section is evaluated by u q bh to determine whether the different measurable cross sections affect the analogy verification results some longitudinal measurements between a proximal roughness row and the next row are made along the positive x direction especially in series d four cross sections with 0 625d 50 2d 50 3 375d 50 and 6 125d 50 are measured in runs d2 and d3 as illustrated in fig s1 of supplemental file the comparison between the different longitudinal section cross measurements which is beyond the scope of this study are found in the figs s2 s7 the results shows that the values of turbulence intensities turbulence kinetic energy and flow mean velocities in different cross sections have a certain effect but not on the trend of the values and position appearing the maximum value therefore in order to facilitate the measurement the following analogy and analysis are based on midline data 4 results the mixing layer analogy is first shown for terrestrial canopies raupach et al 1996 and then aquatic vegetation ghisalberti 2002 the analogy has made great improvements in regions with aquatic vegetation due to a wide range of ecosystem services particularly in proposing the length scale of vortex penetration into the canopy nepf et al 2007 exploring turbulent transport and exchange between the canopy and overflow nepf 2012b and finding the variation of the inflection velocity profile in different density sea grass nepf 2012a however the extension of this analogy to shallow flow conditions is less applicable despite some similarities between aquatic vegetation and gravel beds katul et al 2002 nikora et al 2004 such characteristics as the porousness large scale roughness and turbulence transport as an analogy of turbulent flow near the top of the gravel bed in shallow flow form a mixing layer flow is suggested preliminarily by the inflectional mean velocity profile u z over the cross section several standard flow statistical properties will follow if the analogy is appropriate for example the values of statistical flow properties such as σu v w u in gravel bed rivers of shallow flow turbulence should be closer to standard values in a mixing layer than a surface layer the extent of conformity between the mixing layer and gravel bed in shallow flow constitutes a series of tests of hypotheses 4 1 basic statistical flow properties fig 6 illustrates the statistical flow properties of gravel bed turbulence with different relative submergence and transversal spacing conditions although the velocity inflection of series a and b is not clear from experiments nevertheless in the distribution of single point turbulence statistics in the c and d series experiments it is obvious the statistics in fig 6 are respectively the mean velocity u z the reynolds shear stress uv the standard deviation σ u z u 2 1 2 and σ w z w 2 1 2 the value of u is crucial in verification of analogy between the ideal mixing layer and shallow gravel bed flow which is used for normalizations as the typical ratio in the ideal mixing layer flow so how to choose accurate approach to calculated u should think over in gravel bed with low submergence and macro roughness three traditional methods to evaluate u have been selected and compared in this work the slope energy approach sea is widely used in open channel uniform flow in this case for u grs r is replaced by position of maximum velocity appearing when the ratio between channel width and depth 5 2 wang et al 2001 the reynolds stress approach rsa is calculated by measuring the distribution of the reynolds stress as u u w z 0 despite possible errors in the measurement of the reynolds stress this method is considered relatively more reliable nikora and goring 2000 poggi et al 2003 the turbulence kinetic energy approach tkea is obtained from the distribution of turbulence kinetic energy u 0 5 c u 2 v 2 w 2 0 5 in which c is a proportionality constant equal to 0 21 kim et al 2000 biron et al 2004 the calculations by all three methods for the 12 scenarios are shown in table 2 the shear velocities of all of the experimental runs calculated by these methods show little difference which indicates that the accuracy of the shear velocity is reliable among them the u calculated by the sea is the largest the u calculated by the rsa is the smallest and the tkea is the closest to the mean value the mean relative errors are respectively 9 61 and 8 23 and 7 51 which show the tkea is more accurate among three methods and applied in the subsequent evaluations the observations in fig 6 have many common features when compared with the ideal mixing layer flow but they also exhibit variations due to differences in the gravel bed spatial density and relative submergence it proves intuitively the a priori assumption that the flow within the roughness elements is much slower than the flow aloft leading to a velocity profile exhibiting a strong inflection point first it is most obvious that u uw σ u and σ w decay rapidly with decreasing water level within the gravel bed especially in series c and d as seen in fig 6 in s shaped velocity conditions σ u u and σ w u the expressions of ratios among the reynolds stress tensor components in a constant stress layer are particularly about 87 and 80 lower it is clear that the momentum transmitted by the turbulence near the top of the gravel layer per unit variance is significantly greater than near the surface layer second in the vicinity of sparsely distributed pebbles bed roughness and near bed turbulence are increased resulting in additional spill resistance the resistance at the top of the rough pebble surface does not continuously produce a shear layer that contains pebble scale vortices controlling the mass and momentum exchange between the pebbles and the overflow for densely submerged pebbles the pebbles could effectively reduce the decay rate of the water velocity above the pebbles so that the rough bed surface becomes a smooth bed in a larger scale and the velocity profile remains logarithmic a strong inflection in u z flow near z d 50 of the gravel bed where the shear u d u d z is maximal in fig 6a the shear strength at the inflection point of the velocity profile is depicted by the length scale u h u h l s decreasing with the increase of the shear strength additionally l s shows typically around k s d 50 but it depends significantly on roughness specifically decreases as roughness increases and on the gravel spatial density which is opposite to the aquatic vegetation nepf et al 2012a b the formulation of l s is developed in detail in the next section third the ratios σ u u and σ w u for the gravel bed k s z 2k s are typically about 1 9 and 1 3 which is similar to the mixing layer flow about 1 7 and 1 3 however in the surface layer where z 2k s the ratios σ u u and σ w u are 1 deviating from the mixing layer flow this suggests that the turbulence near the top of the rough pebbles is more organized in some sense than the inertial sub layer turbulence delivering momentum more efficiently 4 2 mixing layer analogy formulation an approximate mean velocity profile of the mixing layer can be derived by modifying eq 16 which generates the key features of the inflectional velocity profile and involving the important flow instabilities as follows 18 u z u 0 1 tanh z k s l s where u 0 is the mean velocity at the reference level and is likely nonzero in permeable gravel bed fig 5a and l s is the strength of the shear at this inflectional point described by the slope of the inflectional velocity distribution profile for an incompressible and inviscid mixing layer l s 1 represents the wave number of the fastest growing instability this significant factor influences the strength but has gotten little attention thus far in studies raupach 1984 and katul et al 1998 has suggested that l s αd 84 where the value of α is about 0 5 for a wide range of terrestrial vegetation types including wind tunnel strips wheat rods agricultural crops and forests furthermore the canopies data show that the value of l s depends significantly on the frontal area index defined as the total frontal area of the canopy roughness elements per unit ground surface area in the direction of wind decreasing as the index increases and on the leaf area density profile decreasing as the leaf area is concentrated near the top of the canopy the mean velocity for gravel bed streams has less attenuation and instabilities can penetrate the entire d 84 for gravel streams but are restricted to the upper 50 for dense canopies katul et al 2002 proposed that flow instabilities can penetrate the entire d 84 for gravel bed streams to decay the mean velocity in which the resulting value of α is 1 thus for different relative submergences and spatial gravel densities the variation of l s in gravel bed streams needs to be analyzed in detail however to our knowledge there are no mathematical formulations to determine the shear strength l s barenblatt 1987 concluded that if the explicit mathematical formulation of the problem is unknown the governing parameters are chosen on the basis of a qualitative model of the phenomenon which each investigator constructs using his her own experience intuition as well as an analysis of previous studies the dimensional independent variables which control a physical process should be firstly rewritten as dimensionless forms a physical process is defined as self similar of a given dimensional group when the functional relationship π 1 f π 2 π 3 π n is independent on variable π n in which f is functional symbol when the f approaches infinitely small and unequal to zero in giving boundary conditions i e π n 0 and π n the self similarity is named complete self similarity of the given dimensional group and can be expressed by π 1 f 1 π 2 π 3 π n 1 when f tends to finite equal to zero or infinity this instance is named incomplete self similarity in the variable π n and can be expressed by π 1 π n β f 1 π 2 π 3 π n 1 where β denotes numerical constant barenblatt 1987 ferro 2018a 2018b for a gravel bed stream with low relative submergence the dimensionless shear strength l s r is influenced by flow regime flow conditions and local gravel bed roughness therefore combining the original dimensional groups it is expressed by the following functional relationship 19 f f r re r l s r 0 where f denotes functional symbol r 0 0001 u h v is the shear reynolds number and r 0 5 h 2 h 0 5 is the hydraulic radius transforming eq 19 yields l s r f f r re r when one of dimensionless variables fr re and r tends to zero or infinity f also has a finite equal to zero or infinity according to the incomplete self similarity hypothesis for the dimensionless groups re fr and r the shear strength law is expressed by the following equation ferro 2018a 20 l s r r a f r b re c where a b and c are numerical constants to be estimated by experimental data in particular eq 20 conforms to the theory of dimensional homogeneity equation 20 demonstrates its dependence on the shear stress froude number and reynolds number in other words the shear strength is affected by flow regime flow condition supercritical subcritical or critical and gravel bed roughness equation 20 is calibrated using the available measurements provided by our experiments runs a1 d3 and wang et al 2015 runs w1 w6 for 18 different cross sections the measured l s is calculated by u z u z in the region near z k s 1 the value of u k s is the slope of fitted line in fig 7 and the following equation is determined 21 l s r r 0 47987 f r 1 38415 re 0 04535 in which the average shear strength of the flume experiments is less than the size of pebbles equaling 0 5d 50 additionally fig 8 shows in more detail the relationship between the shear strength l s calculated by eq 21 and the pebble spatial density λ calculated by eq 17 generally the denser the riverbed configuration the larger value of l s when the spacing of pebbles in the gravel bed becomes smaller the gravel scale turbulence can be restricted to the upper 50 for a dense gravel bed on the contrary for larger spacing the turbulence can easily penetrate to the lower 50 for a sparse gravel bed even to the bottom of elements integrating eq 18 along the vertical direction of the flow the depth averaged velocity of cross section is given by 22 u u 0 1 h 0 h 1 tanh z k s l s d z 1 l s h ln cosh h l s k s l s cosh k s l s because of the confusing relationship of the difference coefficient c u u 0 u some researchers have proposed varied approaches to calculate in fields of terrestrial canopies aquatic vegetation and gravel bed raupach et al 1996 and katul et al 1998 suggested that c u 3 3 for dense terrestrial canopies ghisalberti 2009 found c u 2 6 for aquatic vegetation katul et al 2002 choose c u 4 5 for gravel bed and lamb 2017a assumed c u f f in which f is functional symbol and f denotes the hydraulic conductivity the difference coefficient c u defined as the ratio of the mean velocity at the reference level to the shear velocity is affected by flow regime flow condition and penetration of the gravel scale turbulence following the subsurface flow model proposed by lamb 2017a the depth averaged subsurface velocity u sub in the low velocity region can be approximated simply by the darcy forchheimer brinkman equation dfbe if the darcy term is neglected the dfbe reduces 23 f u 2 1 ρ g d τ dz s where the dimensionless value f is equal to c f ϕ sub g k and cf is the forchheimer coefficient ϕ sub is the porosity in the subsurface and k is the permeability then integrating eq 23 across the low velocity region as above yields 24 u sub u 2 1 c 1 g l s in which u sub 1 l s l s 0 udz is the depth averaged velocity in the low velocity region of penetration height and τ 0 τ b ρ g h s for steady and uniform surface flow the approximation of l s 0 u 2 d z c u sub 2 is assumed as order one lamb 2017a in which c is an order one constant when the average kinetic energy of the water flow is larger more energy is transmitted to the low velocity region within the roughness elements through the kh instability vortexes and the more obvious the increase of u sub the fluid inertial force expressed by the forchheimer term increases as the velocity in the porous media increases caused by the kh instability vortexes the viscous turbulent shear stress is also raised as the distortion of fluid velocity in porous media increases the relative magnitude of the inertial and viscous turbulent shear stresses in this flow can been evaluated using the flow reynolds number re the near bottom water flow develops into a highly mixed turbulent flow and the mutual perturbation between the vortexes transmitted to the theoretical surface bed is enhanced this flow in the low velocity regime is easily form a supercritical condition due to the shallow water and large roughness elements the lift force acting on the vortex body in supercritical flow is further pushed within roughness elements to increase u sub the flow condition can been evaluated by the flow froude number fr therefore the right hand side of eq 24 can been expressed by the flow reynolds number and the froude number as u sub u ζ re f r the velocity at the theoretical surface bed can be treated as a dimensional quantity by scaling u 0 to the characteristic velocity in the subsurface layer u sub assuming that the dimensionless velocity at the reference bed shows similarity with respect to the hydraulic radius r the following asymptotic power law is defined 25 u 0 u sub m r l s n then by substituting u sub u into eq 25 c u can be further expressed using the 18 experimental measurements and the following equation is obtained 26 u 0 u c u m r l s n re p exp f r in which the constants m n and p are respectively 0 35 1 0 and 0 44 the linear regression model has a coefficient of determination equal to 0 881 using the measurements corresponding to the 18 investigated runs the comparison between the measured and calculated c u is illustrated in fig 9 finally substituting eq 26 into eq 22 the proposed multivariable flow resistance equation is obtained 27 u u 0 7 r l s 1 1 re 0 33 exp f r 1 l s h ln cosh h l s k s l s cosh k s l s the experimental data is substituted into eq 21 to obtain the value of l s and then into eq 27 to evaluate the calculated friction factor 8 f 0 5 the comparison between the measured and calculated values is shown in fig 10 in detail the coefficient of determination is equal to 0 841 and the relative error which is defined as the ratio of the absolute value of the difference between the measured value and the calculated value to the measured value is 6 91 5 discussions 5 1 field data calibration the two key variables the shear strength l s and the difference coefficient c u of the multivariable mixing layer analogy approach are evaluated using laboratory data in comparison with field studies laboratory experiments are usually performed under well controlled flow and bed conditions for further calibrating the applicability and accuracy of eq 27 a total of 104 sets of field measured data from shallow gravel bed sources in 40 different rivers which are previously published are compiled simi 1925 1950 colosimo et al 1988 ferro and porto 2018 the flow measurements are carried out during low flow conditions reflecting the complexity of the gravel bed in shallow flow in particular these measurements are chosen based on the assumption of quasi uniform flow conditions over straight reaches and the surface bed material is sampled using wolman s grid by a number sampling procedure the detail range of fr re h and d 84 encountered in these data sets are also presented in table 3 the average relative submergence h k s from three independent gravel bed sources are respectively 2 8 5 6 and 11 1 this range completely contains large scale roughness transition and small scale roughness conditions classified by bathurst et al 1981 and extends the experimental simulation sequences as illustrated in table 4 in this study the large scale roughness condition including large scale and transition conditions h d 84 4 are confirmed in addition the single mixing layer analogy approach in eq 14 proposed by katul et al 2002 and the standard semi empirical equations in eq 6 proposed by hey 1979 are chosen as reference models in these equations the value of k s is the grain roughness which is approximately equal to the diameter of the boundary sediment and equal to d 84 in non uniform sediment data sets additionally due to the non uniformity of sediment in natural streams the sediment accumulation is much denser with stronger permeability than in the flume experiments turbulence near the gravel bed is expected to reduce as the interaction with the water surface diminishes the strength and size of the gravel scale vortices the gravel scale turbulence does not penetrate to the entire d 84 for gravel bed streams so the coefficient constants in the natural streams are different from the constants for experimental data the best fitting constants m n and p for the 104 field data sets are respectively calibrated as 0 7 and 1 1 and 0 33 the comparison between the measured and calculated c u as illustrated in fig 11 it should be noted that the average value of the calculated c u is equal to 4 7 which is in middle of the values of 3 3 katul et al 1988 and 5 8 wiberg and smith 1991 specified for rough wall boundary layer flows and slightly greater than the value of 4 5 proposed by katul et al 2002 in shallow streams moreover the similarly derived eq 14 based on the concept of the mixed layer is optimized by introducing a difference coefficient c u that varies with flow conditions such as supercritical subcritical or critical in eq 26 the instability that can penetrate the entire d 84 for gravel bed streams as proposed by katul et al is also used which is verified since the roughness concentration is distributed within the lower 20 of d 84 therefore l s in eq 27 is replaced by d 84 and the constant n should be adjusted for best fitting due to the change of penetration length the optimized katul equation becomes 28 8 f 0 7 r l s 1 3 re 0 33 exp f r 1 d 84 h ln cosh 1 h d 84 cosh 1 the final comparisons with four different flow resistance equations for the data is shown in fig 12 in most gravel beds with low relative submergence the flow resistance is generally 1 and small values cause many errors in predicting processes according to fig 12 the slight agreement between the measured and calculated values of the darcy weisbach friction factor using the hey standard logarithmic formulation eq 6 and a katul single variable mixing layer formulation eq 14 is demonstrated which suggests that these deduced formulations might be not be applicable for gravel beds with low relative submergence in fig 12 a and b the calculated values are larger than measured in the range of 8 f 0 5 7 and smaller in the range of 8 f 0 5 9 fig 12 c shows good agreement between the measured 8 f 0 5 values and those calculated by eq 27 which confirms the accuracy of this flow resistance estimate criterion fig 12 d shows a significant improvement as compared with fig 12 b and eq 14 by introducing the difference coefficient c u the mean relative error between the measured and calculated values is reduced from 70 using eqs 6 and 14 to 17 9 using eq 27 and 26 4 using eq 28 however it must be said that the smaller the river resistance the larger the error which is shown when the measured value deviates from the calculated value by about 10 in fig 12 c and by about 40 in fig 12 d when 8 f 0 5 10 the reasonable interpretation is that the mixing layer cannot be developed without velocity gradient deduced by large speed and not submerged flow in fig 12 c and d the calculated accuracy 8 f 0 5 is lower at low resistance of smaller discharge but improves considerably with increasing flows fortunately high discharge conditions are more useful for most engineering purposes as they control both flood hazards and sediment transport 5 2 comparison of flow resistance equations in many processes of predicted model development quantitative statistics are the key to evaluating the performance of a model or equation the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nsei and root mean square error rmse are widely reliable statistics used for assessing the goodness of fit of hydrological models mccuen et al 2006 the nsei indicates the strength of the agreement between the measured data the predicted data and the 1 1 line according to the following function 29 nsei 1 i 1 i n y i y i 2 i 1 i n y i y i 2 in which y i and y i are the predicted and measured values of the dependent variable y respectively y i denotes the mean measured values of y and n is the sample size this index has a value of 0 to 1 0 when the predictions of a linear model are accurate and a negative index can be produced if the predictions of the model are inaccurate the rmse describes the difference between model predictions and actual variables in units of variables and is calculated by 30 rmse i 1 i n y i y i 2 n using eqs 29 and 30 the fitting effect can be calculated by quantitative statistics as illustrated in table 5 the results show that of the three approaches the model using the mixing layer is better than logarithmic formulation the approach with the smallest rmse and nsei closest to 1 is the model from eq 27 proposed by this study which suggests good fit to assess the flow resistance in low submergence streams with gravel and cobble beds in addition the optimized katul equation eq 28 has a smaller rmse and larger nsei than before eq 14 significantly showing good optimization the multivariable mixing layer analogy is developed to reproduce flow resistance formulation for low submergence streams with gravel and cobble beds although it is more complex and requires more input variables the approach is more accurate than the hey semi empirical equation or the katul signal variable mixing layer equation furthermore the derivation of this approach is not completely different from others based on the classical boundary layer analogy which indicates that the interaction between the roughness element and the fluid causing the resistance is consistent with the mixing layer analogy 6 conclusions how to accurately determine the flow resistance in many natural streams especially in gravel bed streams of mountainous regimes with low relative submergence is still a fascinating problem in all ages in this study the flow resistance of gravel bed streams with low relative submergence in mountainous rivers is reproduced based on the completely different view as an analogy from the mixing layer which leads to free shear instabilities between the different velocity fluid layers to determine the physical rationality and accuracy of the analogy the values of statistical flow properties in laboratory experiments with different relative submergence are conducted showing that the roughness of shallow flow turbulence is closer to standard values in a mixing layer than in a surface layer the multivariable mixing layer analogy law which relates the shear strength l s applying an incomplete self similarity analysis for the dimensionless groups and difference coefficient c u using a simplified darcy forchheimer brinkman equation the final formulations of two key parameters are expressed and tested using laboratory experimental data using more available measurements in 104 field data the multivariable mixing layer equation is calibrated for denser natural gravel beds the good agreement of darcy weisbach friction factor using the multivariable mixing layer analogy equation is supported by a closer 1 nash sutcliffe index and smaller root mean square error also the developed equation is slightly more accurate than the hey standard semi empirical equation and the katul signal variable mixing layer analogy equation showing the lowest relative error additionally the optimized katul equation introducing the proposed coefficient c u also performs significantly better than the previous single variable mixing layer equation in conclusion the results obtained in this study encourage the use of the mixing layer in this research field and suggest that future work can take the advantage of this approach to investigate the s shaped velocity distribution in rough

5248,previous studies show that the flow velocity profile is s shaped for low submergence flows in gravel bed streams as a consequence the power or logarithmic flow resistance equations cannot be theoretically deduced for a low submergence flow in this study the mixing layer analogy in an accurate and innovative way is applied to express the flow resistance in gravel bed streams laboratory experiments over 12 uniform gravel bed runs the relative submerged height ranging from 2 6 to 4 6 are used to determine the physical rationality and accuracy of the analogy that statistical flow turbulent properties are closer to typical values in the mixing layer than in the surface layer the key parameters of shear strength l s applied by an incomplete self similarity analysis for the dimensionless groups and difference coefficient c u defined as the ratio of velocity at the reference level to shear velocity deduced by the simplified darcy forchheimer brinkman equation are expressed and tested using experimental data the new approach is further underpinned by using 104 field measured reaches located in 40 different natural streams which adds to the more widely ranged field data with the relative submerged height ranging from 0 9 to 20 the analysis shows that the flow layer subdivisions theoretical approach based on the multivariable mixing layer analogy and optimized katul law characterized by the lowest root mean square error relative error and closest 1 nash sutcliffe index has potential in future research keywords flow resistance mixing layer flow shallow flow gravel bed stream incomplete self similarity large scale roughness 1 introduction flow resistance is fundamental for controlling flow hydraulics and fluvial geomorphology in man made channels or natural streams it contributes to the properties of the average velocity water level and other related turbulent variables quantifying the flow resistance in gravel bed streams is of significant importance from several points of view including flood risk and debris flow prediction bed material transport benthic habitat restoration and anticipation of the evolved mountainous landscapes nevertheless the appropriate quantitative evaluation of gravel bed resistance still has unsolved problem awaiting clarification these problems include 1 the gravel bed roughness cannot be effectively characterized by a single percentile of particle size distribution nikora et al 1998 canovaro et al 2007 2 the intermittent and energetic turbulence coherent structures within and just above large roughness elements have a great influence 3 the behavior of different proportions of the dominant sources of skin friction for shear stresses and form drag for pressure forces as relative submergence decreases is not known cheng 2014 powell 2014 what is needed is a method to predict flow resistance from readily observable and time invariant hydraulic properties classical resistance coefficients for open channel flows are the chezy c manning s n and the darcy weisbach friction factor f a law defining the relationship between the flow resistance coefficient and the hydraulic variables is called the flow resistance equation however less attention has been paid to the uniform flow of large scale roughness in gravel bed streams in which the bed particle size equals the uniform flow depth h above gravel bed ferro 2003 for studying the relationship between the flow resistance and hydraulic properties in gravel bed channels some relative inundation criteria for the main process of dividing flow resistance have been proposed and applied in the field bathurst 1982 used d 50 or d 84 in which the particle size of 50 or 84 percent of the material is finer to propose the following classifications with large scale roughness defined as h d 50 2 or h d 84 1 2 transition defined as 2 h d 50 7 5 or 1 2 h d 84 4 and small scale roughness as h d 50 7 5 or h d 84 4 bray and davar 1987 evaluated flow resistance by defining large scale roughness for jet and wake as h d 50 3 transition to large scale as 3 h d 50 10 transition to small scale as 10 h d 50 20 and small scale roughness shear flow as h d 50 20 lawrence 1997 defined the inundation ratio with the same relative submergence rate as λ h k where h denotes the mean uniform flow depth and k is the characteristic roughness scale for the surface in order to distinguish three flow regimes representing large scale roughness as λ 1 transition as 1 λ 10 and small scale roughness as λ 10 ferguson 2007 proposed a non dimensional hydraulic geometry equation with two flow regimes defining large scale roughness shallow flow as h d 84 4 and small scale roughness deep flow as h d 84 4 low relative submergence of open channel flow where h d 84 4 is commonly found in mountainous areas with high gradients and seasonal high flow rates such as china southeast and the pacific northwest this channel bed is characterized by a spatially disorganized pattern of cobbles and boulders which have high resistance in comparison with alluvial rivers powell 2014 this is related to resistance to the shape of the channel and the movement of the sediment particles lamb et al 2017a b as observed in previous studies the velocity distribution profile for a large scale roughness condition is s shaped ferro and baiamonte 1994 ferro and pecoraro 2000 katul et al 2002 rickenmann and recking 2011 ferro and porto 2018a b surface flow velocity deviate from logarithmic law and higher than near bed velocity dominated by the loss of flow momentum mainly due to the resistance around the particles near the river bed canovaro et al 2007 based on a series of accurate flume experiments wang et al 2015 obtain the occurrence conditions of the s shaped velocity distribution profile if the roughness height hydraulic radius ratio d 84 r froude number fr u gh and u is the mean uniform flow velocity of cross section and reynolds number re ur υ and υ is the kinematic viscosity are 0 15 0 47 and 60 000 respectively the velocity and stress of near bed flow regime are strongly affected by blockage and form drag induced by the roughness hence no large scale boundary layer turbulence is developed and the large roughness element vortices dominated by the turbulence both within and above the particles resemble turbulence vegetation canopies with coherent eddies nepf 2012a the preliminary interpretation for this shape of the velocity profile is that it is dependent on the bed elements which act individually to produce a total resistance based mainly on the sum of their profile drags ferro and porto 2018a b in particular the basis of flow resistance equations applicable to low gradient rivers with sandy and small scale roughness are traditionally formed by the classical analyses of one dimensional pipe flow such as boundary layers or a logarithmic velocity distribution equation however shallow flow resistance in open channel with large scale roughness estimation becomes more complicated and the equations using classical analyses are not efficient smith et al 2007 this work is motivated by the mixing layer theory for flow resistance originally developed for canopy turbulence applied by katul et al 2002 which is indirectly related to building a canopy turbulence bridge between the gravel bed and the mixed layer theory however the analogy is accurate only if the values of the statistical flow properties in gravel bed streams of shallow flow turbulence are closer to standard values in a mixing layer than a surface layer therefore the basic theme of this paper is to demonstrate the analogy between the gravel bed shallow streams and the mixing layer flow first the mixing layer theory from hydrodynamic mechanism presented by paupach 1996 and finnigan 2000 is briefly reviewed and the resultant flow resistance equations of large scale roughness condition listed second to illustrate the reasonability and accuracy of the mixing layer analogy flume experiments of gravel bed are conducted based on statistical flow properties with different gravel density and relative submergence third from this work a new flow resistance equation based on the multivariable mixing layer analogy rather than the standard rough wall boundary layer theory is found by introducing the reynolds number froude number shear stress and tests for an undetermined constant using laboratory experimental data 2 6 h k s 4 6 finally a wider range of field data in different natural gravel bed streams 0 9 h k s 20 are used to analyze the applicability and accuracy of flow resistance equations 2 theories 2 1 flow resistance three classical relationships linking velocity and flow resistance which are the most widely applied powell 2014 are the previously mentioned chezy manning and darcy weisbach equations given by 1 u c r s f 1 n r 2 3 s f 1 2 8 g r s f f where r is the hydraulic radius sf is the friction slope usually approximated by water surface or channel slope s g is gravitational acceleration and c m1 2s 1 n m 1 3s and f dimensionless are the chezy coefficient manning coefficient and darcy weisbach friction factor respectively it should be noted that f is a dimensionless parameter so that it can easily be generalized and physically interpreted in comparison to other coefficients since the shear velocity u τ 0 ρ where τ 0 is the bottom shear stress per unit bed area and ρ is water density reflects the shear of flow layers the ratio u u is applied widely to parameterize flow resistance dividing eq 1 by the shear velocity u we obtain 2 u u c g 1 2 r 1 6 n g 1 2 8 f applying the prandlt karman theory of turbulence to a circular and rectangular wide cross section the velocity profile is approximated by the logarithmic equation by integrating the logarithmic velocity profile over the cross section the mean velocity is deduced as 3 u u 1 k ln r k s where k s denotes grain size roughness height characterized by a single percentile of the particle size distribution and k denotes von karman s constant with a constant value of 0 4 by substituting eq 3 into the dimensionless eq 2 the flow resistance equations can be used extensively in deep open channel by measuring the roughness height and hydraulic radius in addition to the previous logarithmic function the simple power law and semi logarithmic approximation approaches are recognized as early as 1880 and have been widely used katul et al 2002 powell 2014 cheng 2017 in the following forms 4 u u n r k s 1 6 5 u u a b log r k s where a b and n are constants found from fitting data the value of n is 6 7 from the manning stricker formula and a and b are 6 25 and 2 5 respectively in the keulegan formula the deep flow conditions as so defined have been used successfully and reported in various scientific studies however the flow resistance prediction using these equations have distinctly deviated from measurement data in shallow stream conditions with large scale roughness ferguson 2007 lamb et al 2017a ferro and porto 2018a b the primary reason is that this flow energy dissipation is influenced by the shape arrangement and concentration of surface roughness elements as well as additional form resistance effects the functions could not be fit to the s shape of the velocity profile when the near bed velocity is significantly lower than the near surface velocity as caused by the protrusion of riverbed particles which occurs in intermediate and large scale roughness conditions ferro 2018 mendicino and colosimo 2019 in recent years several useful flow resistance laws for large scale roughness conditions have been developed by modifying the logarithmic and power laws based on the colebrook white type equation hey 1979 proposed a relationship in gravel bed rivers for h d 84 0 3 as following 6 8 f 6 25 5 75 log r 3 5 d 84 smart et al 2002 currently describes bed roughness for large scale conditions by utilizing the volumetric hydraulic radius r v volume of water per unit area of bed and the standard deviation of the bed surface elevation d z they showed that the r v d z exponent of the power law flow resistance equations is enlarged from 1 6 to 1 2 with the increase in relative submergence the equations have the forms 7a 8 f c r v d z 0 5 d x d z 0 5 d z r v 0 03 7b 8 f c r v d z 1 25 d x d z 0 5 d z r v 0 03 where d x and d y are the roughness elements in the stream wise and cross stream dimensions respectively ferguson 2007 used a simple two way cut to express 8 f a 1 r d 1 6 in deep flows and 8 f a 2 r d in shallow flows where a 1 7 8 and a 2 1 4 are empirical coefficients integrating the effects of river bed form and sediment skin friction f is obtained as a sum of two components 8 8 f a 1 a 2 r d 84 a 1 2 a 1 2 r d 84 5 3 using the similar ferguson approach with discharge as input rickenmann and recking 2011 also proposed new dimensionless variables and a new equation that performs the best in comparison to eq 8 this new form is 9 8 f 4 416 r d 84 1 904 1 r 1 283 d 84 1 618 1 083 considering contracted and spill energy losses associated with large scale roughness cheng 2014 derived the resistance formula applying to both shallow and deep flow conditions theoretically as 10 8 f s f 2 h d 84 1 3 h 2 d 84 β h d 84 α 1 h d 84 α h d 84 α β 2 1 2 where α 0 1 and β 0 25 are calibrated parameters using laboratory and field data additionally cheng 2017 by considering the roughness induced flow constriction modified manning strickler ms formula to be 11 f 0 115 d 84 h 1 3 1 0 75 d 84 h 2 ferro and porto 2018a b applied the self similarity hypothesis to deduce flow resistance law in gravel bed channels and obtained 12a f 8 2 1 δ γ re δ δ 1 δ 2 2 1 δ 12b δ 1 5 ln re 12c γ a f r b s c where re uh υ is the reynolds number fr u gh is froude number and a 0 313 b 1 1158 and c 0 5557 are applied for large scale roughness conditions 0 21 h d 84 1 69 due to the inaccuracy to calculate the flow resistance by using a logarithmic law for shallow flows with large scale roughness some alternative approaches for predicting flow resistance in shallow flows have been sought recently nikora et al 2001 2004 use novel applications to develop the new flow resistance theory in shallow flows from the navier stokes equations in the flow type over partially inundated rough bed flows the equation form for 0 6 h d 90 5 is 13 8 f c m h δ where the range of chezy s coefficient c is between 3 and 7 from experimental data the parameter m depends on roughness geometry and is weakly dependent on h and approximately a constant 0 6 and the thickness δ is defined as the appropriate maximum size following nikora s approach lamb et al 2017 used a hybrid eddy viscosity model for steep streams which contains the relationship among the shear strength water level above the bed and riverbed roughness also katul et al 2002 directly used the mixing layer analogy of canopy turbulence for the inflectional velocity profile without verification to gravel bed and derived an equation for 0 2 h d 84 7 14 8 f 4 5 1 d 84 h ln cosh 1 h d 84 cosh 1 fig 1 illustrates the correlation and comparison between 8 f 0 5 and the relative submergence h d 84 for these widely used equations equation 10 and 12 are absent due to lack of flow parameters and eq 13 is also short of fitting c clearly despite that it can be seen that all of the equations are close for small scale roughness condition h d 84 4 but enormous differences exist among the trend of these equations for the large scale roughness condition 0 1 h d 84 4 2 2 the mixing layer theory the ideal mixing layer is the free shear flow formed by two coflowing streams with different densities or velocities downstream of a splitter plate fig 2 which is characterized by an internal velocity gradient at an inlet section and independent evolution of fixed boundaries finnigan 2000 sukhodolova and sukhodolov 2012a b the theory is widely applicable in the emerging fields of atmospheric sciences aeromechanics environmental techniques and chemical manufacturing there are two characteristic velocities u c u 1 u 2 2 and δ u u 2 u 1 where u 1 and u 2 are the low and high velocities respectively the depth of the mixing layer is expressed by the vorticity thickness δ w δ u d u d z max z x z 0 x where z x denotes flow height perpendicular to the flow and z 0 is a virtual origin as a result of a simple geometrical relationship between these length scales the momentum thickness δ m 1 4 u u c δ u 2 is typically to δ w 2 π in connection with the shape of velocity distribution profile raupach et al 1996 two decades ago paupach proposed several observed flow structure and turbulence properties in the fully developed self preserving mixing layer flow as illustrated in fig 3 there is a strong inflection in the velocity distribution profile at the centerline of a splitter plate fig 3a and isolated symmetric peaks in the reynolds shear stress u w and the velocity standard deviations σ u u 2 1 2 and σ w w 2 1

for the mixing layer as max uw 1 2 the uw correlation coefficient as r uw uw σ u σ w the terms of the turbulent kinetic energy budget are shown as strong turbulent transport fig 3c and given by brunet and collineau 1994 the turbulent energy equation is an important equation in characterizing turbulent energy exchange using the following terms raupach et al 1996 15 e 2 t p s p w p b t t t p ε where e 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 2 is the turbulent kinetic energy tke budget the terms p s p w and p b are the shear wake and buoyant production respectively while t t and t p are the turbulent and pressure transport and ε denotes dissipation these terms of the tke budget have conventional forms there are anti symmetric double peaks in the plot of u and w skewness sk u and sk w fig 3d the inverse turbulent prandtl number is pr t 1 k h k m approximately close to 2 in a mixing layer fig 3d in which k m uw u z and k h wt t z are the eddy diffusivities for momentum and heat respectively the variables t and t denote mean and fluctuating potential temperatures respectively classical linear hydrodynamics stability theory hst has been applied for initially analyzing the mixing layer evolution from experimental and numerical simulation results michalke 1964 this work takes notice of the stability properties downstream in a plane shear flow with a strong inflection point in the velocity profile distribution resembled by fig 3a the inflected velocity profile of the inviscid mixing layer is affected unstably by small perturbations and transverse unstable modes of kelvin helmholtz kh instability dominate the vertical transport at the interface integration of the rayleigh equation simplified to the case of the unstable mixing layer calculated an approximately hyperbolic tangent function for the unperturbed mean velocity profile given by 16 u z u s 1 tanh z z c l s where u z is defined as the average velocity at z and u z d u d z velocity differential δ u 2 u s u 2 u 1 and the shear strength l s is the strength of the shear flow at the inflection point described by the length scale l s u z u z δ w 2 linking to the roller type vortices thickness and z c is the centerline position of the mixing layer 3 laboratory experimental setup laboratory experiments are conducted in a 16 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 4 m high rectangular flume with a large slope s 2 5 at the state key lab of hydraulics and mountain river engineering in sichuan university across a range of water discharge with 10 l s q 60 l s the flume experimental configuration is shown in fig 4 the flow is tripped by a rectangular weir with a wide top to enter the flume generating a steady uniform flow in open channel and rapidly dissipating inflow turbulence the model rough gravel bed is located in the middle of flume and is 4 0 m long with the velocity distribution is measured uniformly along the vertical direction distributed at each cross section a one meter long rough surface constituted by uniform rubble is placed in the front and back of the model rough gravel bed to avoid large scale disturbance in the reach under investigation for the coordinate frame employed the x axis is the principal axis of the flume positive in the flow direction the z axis is vertical normal to the flume floor and oriented upwards the y axis is normal to the x z plane and forms together with the other two axes a right handed coordinate system the origin is set 0 at the front of the model rough gravel bed y 0 in the lateral center of the flume and z 0 at the bottom of the model rough gravel bed in the model of rough gravel bed reach the different planimetric arrangements of the gravel bed are set up characterized by the diameter d 50 of 4 0 cm uniform pebbles circular ping pong balls are used in this study experiments are carried out on different flow discharge and pebble particle size the transversal distance of pebbles refers to a streamwise sequence of the transversal large roughness scale bed placed along the x axis the spacing s is n times that of pebble diameter and varied from 0 0 to 28 0 cm which reflects changes in bed pebble spatial density based on changes in spacing the pebble spatial density λ is defined as the ratio between the model rough gravel bed reach volumes occupied by the gravel elements in the lower layer v g and the total volume v w of the lower layer therefore λ can be defined as follows 17 λ v g v w π n d 50 2 6 b l π 6 d 50 s d 50 where n is the number of gravel elements arranged on the model rough gravel bed reach and b and l are the width and length of the model rough gravel bed reach respectively the planimetric arrangements of the rough elements are shown in fig 5 notwithstanding that the influence on the natural macro roughness pattern is quantitatively different from flume experiments some common behavior between natural streams and regular roughness geometry can be observed in the flume experiments canovaro et al 2007 all the experiments are carried out in the case of fixed bed and uniform steady flow conditions the flow velocities for each of the flow scenarios are measured at the midline between the adjacent transversal gravel elements which are illustrated in fig 5 by red dashed line the measurement separation distance is 1 0 cm within regions above the flume bottom to obtain the detailed velocity profile of each vertical monitoring line about 45 s records are taken using a down looking three dimensional acoustic doppler velocimeter adv 50 hz manufactured by sontek incorporated company to capture the near surface and shear flow region the number of measurements of the velocity at the monitoring point is 3000 the instrument is set to screen out the data points with the correlation coefficient above 70 and data with a confidence are used higher than 90 as the testing points for next analysis twelve scenarios are characterized by the flow depth h and flow discharge q as detailed in table 1 and each run is measured under uniform flow with the liquid discharges maintained constant in table 1 the mean velocity of cross section is evaluated by u q bh to determine whether the different measurable cross sections affect the analogy verification results some longitudinal measurements between a proximal roughness row and the next row are made along the positive x direction especially in series d four cross sections with 0 625d 50 2d 50 3 375d 50 and 6 125d 50 are measured in runs d2 and d3 as illustrated in fig s1 of supplemental file the comparison between the different longitudinal section cross measurements which is beyond the scope of this study are found in the figs s2 s7 the results shows that the values of turbulence intensities turbulence kinetic energy and flow mean velocities in different cross sections have a certain effect but not on the trend of the values and position appearing the maximum value therefore in order to facilitate the measurement the following analogy and analysis are based on midline data 4 results the mixing layer analogy is first shown for terrestrial canopies raupach et al 1996 and then aquatic vegetation ghisalberti 2002 the analogy has made great improvements in regions with aquatic vegetation due to a wide range of ecosystem services particularly in proposing the length scale of vortex penetration into the canopy nepf et al 2007 exploring turbulent transport and exchange between the canopy and overflow nepf 2012b and finding the variation of the inflection velocity profile in different density sea grass nepf 2012a however the extension of this analogy to shallow flow conditions is less applicable despite some similarities between aquatic vegetation and gravel beds katul et al 2002 nikora et al 2004 such characteristics as the porousness large scale roughness and turbulence transport as an analogy of turbulent flow near the top of the gravel bed in shallow flow form a mixing layer flow is suggested preliminarily by the inflectional mean velocity profile u z over the cross section several standard flow statistical properties will follow if the analogy is appropriate for example the values of statistical flow properties such as σu v w u in gravel bed rivers of shallow flow turbulence should be closer to standard values in a mixing layer than a surface layer the extent of conformity between the mixing layer and gravel bed in shallow flow constitutes a series of tests of hypotheses 4 1 basic statistical flow properties fig 6 illustrates the statistical flow properties of gravel bed turbulence with different relative submergence and transversal spacing conditions although the velocity inflection of series a and b is not clear from experiments nevertheless in the distribution of single point turbulence statistics in the c and d series experiments it is obvious the statistics in fig 6 are respectively the mean velocity u z the reynolds shear stress uv the standard deviation σ u z u 2 1 2 and σ w z w 2 1 2 the value of u is crucial in verification of analogy between the ideal mixing layer and shallow gravel bed flow which is used for normalizations as the typical ratio in the ideal mixing layer flow so how to choose accurate approach to calculated u should think over in gravel bed with low submergence and macro roughness three traditional methods to evaluate u have been selected and compared in this work the slope energy approach sea is widely used in open channel uniform flow in this case for u grs r is replaced by position of maximum velocity appearing when the ratio between channel width and depth 5 2 wang et al 2001 the reynolds stress approach rsa is calculated by measuring the distribution of the reynolds stress as u u w z 0 despite possible errors in the measurement of the reynolds stress this method is considered relatively more reliable nikora and goring 2000 poggi et al 2003 the turbulence kinetic energy approach tkea is obtained from the distribution of turbulence kinetic energy u 0 5 c u 2 v 2 w 2 0 5 in which c is a proportionality constant equal to 0 21 kim et al 2000 biron et al 2004 the calculations by all three methods for the 12 scenarios are shown in table 2 the shear velocities of all of the experimental runs calculated by these methods show little difference which indicates that the accuracy of the shear velocity is reliable among them the u calculated by the sea is the largest the u calculated by the rsa is the smallest and the tkea is the closest to the mean value the mean relative errors are respectively 9 61 and 8 23 and 7 51 which show the tkea is more accurate among three methods and applied in the subsequent evaluations the observations in fig 6 have many common features when compared with the ideal mixing layer flow but they also exhibit variations due to differences in the gravel bed spatial density and relative submergence it proves intuitively the a priori assumption that the flow within the roughness elements is much slower than the flow aloft leading to a velocity profile exhibiting a strong inflection point first it is most obvious that u uw σ u and σ w decay rapidly with decreasing water level within the gravel bed especially in series c and d as seen in fig 6 in s shaped velocity conditions σ u u and σ w u the expressions of ratios among the reynolds stress tensor components in a constant stress layer are particularly about 87 and 80 lower it is clear that the momentum transmitted by the turbulence near the top of the gravel layer per unit variance is significantly greater than near the surface layer second in the vicinity of sparsely distributed pebbles bed roughness and near bed turbulence are increased resulting in additional spill resistance the resistance at the top of the rough pebble surface does not continuously produce a shear layer that contains pebble scale vortices controlling the mass and momentum exchange between the pebbles and the overflow for densely submerged pebbles the pebbles could effectively reduce the decay rate of the water velocity above the pebbles so that the rough bed surface becomes a smooth bed in a larger scale and the velocity profile remains logarithmic a strong inflection in u z flow near z d 50 of the gravel bed where the shear u d u d z is maximal in fig 6a the shear strength at the inflection point of the velocity profile is depicted by the length scale u h u h l s decreasing with the increase of the shear strength additionally l s shows typically around k s d 50 but it depends significantly on roughness specifically decreases as roughness increases and on the gravel spatial density which is opposite to the aquatic vegetation nepf et al 2012a b the formulation of l s is developed in detail in the next section third the ratios σ u u and σ w u for the gravel bed k s z 2k s are typically about 1 9 and 1 3 which is similar to the mixing layer flow about 1 7 and 1 3 however in the surface layer where z 2k s the ratios σ u u and σ w u are 1 deviating from the mixing layer flow this suggests that the turbulence near the top of the rough pebbles is more organized in some sense than the inertial sub layer turbulence delivering momentum more efficiently 4 2 mixing layer analogy formulation an approximate mean velocity profile of the mixing layer can be derived by modifying eq 16 which generates the key features of the inflectional velocity profile and involving the important flow instabilities as follows 18 u z u 0 1 tanh z k s l s where u 0 is the mean velocity at the reference level and is likely nonzero in permeable gravel bed fig 5a and l s is the strength of the shear at this inflectional point described by the slope of the inflectional velocity distribution profile for an incompressible and inviscid mixing layer l s 1 represents the wave number of the fastest growing instability this significant factor influences the strength but has gotten little attention thus far in studies raupach 1984 and katul et al 1998 has suggested that l s αd 84 where the value of α is about 0 5 for a wide range of terrestrial vegetation types including wind tunnel strips wheat rods agricultural crops and forests furthermore the canopies data show that the value of l s depends significantly on the frontal area index defined as the total frontal area of the canopy roughness elements per unit ground surface area in the direction of wind decreasing as the index increases and on the leaf area density profile decreasing as the leaf area is concentrated near the top of the canopy the mean velocity for gravel bed streams has less attenuation and instabilities can penetrate the entire d 84 for gravel streams but are restricted to the upper 50 for dense canopies katul et al 2002 proposed that flow instabilities can penetrate the entire d 84 for gravel bed streams to decay the mean velocity in which the resulting value of α is 1 thus for different relative submergences and spatial gravel densities the variation of l s in gravel bed streams needs to be analyzed in detail however to our knowledge there are no mathematical formulations to determine the shear strength l s barenblatt 1987 concluded that if the explicit mathematical formulation of the problem is unknown the governing parameters are chosen on the basis of a qualitative model of the phenomenon which each investigator constructs using his her own experience intuition as well as an analysis of previous studies the dimensional independent variables which control a physical process should be firstly rewritten as dimensionless forms a physical process is defined as self similar of a given dimensional group when the functional relationship π 1 f π 2 π 3 π n is independent on variable π n in which f is functional symbol when the f approaches infinitely small and unequal to zero in giving boundary conditions i e π n 0 and π n the self similarity is named complete self similarity of the given dimensional group and can be expressed by π 1 f 1 π 2 π 3 π n 1 when f tends to finite equal to zero or infinity this instance is named incomplete self similarity in the variable π n and can be expressed by π 1 π n β f 1 π 2 π 3 π n 1 where β denotes numerical constant barenblatt 1987 ferro 2018a 2018b for a gravel bed stream with low relative submergence the dimensionless shear strength l s r is influenced by flow regime flow conditions and local gravel bed roughness therefore combining the original dimensional groups it is expressed by the following functional relationship 19 f f r re r l s r 0 where f denotes functional symbol r 0 0001 u h v is the shear reynolds number and r 0 5 h 2 h 0 5 is the hydraulic radius transforming eq 19 yields l s r f f r re r when one of dimensionless variables fr re and r tends to zero or infinity f also has a finite equal to zero or infinity according to the incomplete self similarity hypothesis for the dimensionless groups re fr and r the shear strength law is expressed by the following equation ferro 2018a 20 l s r r a f r b re c where a b and c are numerical constants to be estimated by experimental data in particular eq 20 conforms to the theory of dimensional homogeneity equation 20 demonstrates its dependence on the shear stress froude number and reynolds number in other words the shear strength is affected by flow regime flow condition supercritical subcritical or critical and gravel bed roughness equation 20 is calibrated using the available measurements provided by our experiments runs a1 d3 and wang et al 2015 runs w1 w6 for 18 different cross sections the measured l s is calculated by u z u z in the region near z k s 1 the value of u k s is the slope of fitted line in fig 7 and the following equation is determined 21 l s r r 0 47987 f r 1 38415 re 0 04535 in which the average shear strength of the flume experiments is less than the size of pebbles equaling 0 5d 50 additionally fig 8 shows in more detail the relationship between the shear strength l s calculated by eq 21 and the pebble spatial density λ calculated by eq 17 generally the denser the riverbed configuration the larger value of l s when the spacing of pebbles in the gravel bed becomes smaller the gravel scale turbulence can be restricted to the upper 50 for a dense gravel bed on the contrary for larger spacing the turbulence can easily penetrate to the lower 50 for a sparse gravel bed even to the bottom of elements integrating eq 18 along the vertical direction of the flow the depth averaged velocity of cross section is given by 22 u u 0 1 h 0 h 1 tanh z k s l s d z 1 l s h ln cosh h l s k s l s cosh k s l s because of the confusing relationship of the difference coefficient c u u 0 u some researchers have proposed varied approaches to calculate in fields of terrestrial canopies aquatic vegetation and gravel bed raupach et al 1996 and katul et al 1998 suggested that c u 3 3 for dense terrestrial canopies ghisalberti 2009 found c u 2 6 for aquatic vegetation katul et al 2002 choose c u 4 5 for gravel bed and lamb 2017a assumed c u f f in which f is functional symbol and f denotes the hydraulic conductivity the difference coefficient c u defined as the ratio of the mean velocity at the reference level to the shear velocity is affected by flow regime flow condition and penetration of the gravel scale turbulence following the subsurface flow model proposed by lamb 2017a the depth averaged subsurface velocity u sub in the low velocity region can be approximated simply by the darcy forchheimer brinkman equation dfbe if the darcy term is neglected the dfbe reduces 23 f u 2 1 ρ g d τ dz s where the dimensionless value f is equal to c f ϕ sub g k and cf is the forchheimer coefficient ϕ sub is the porosity in the subsurface and k is the permeability then integrating eq 23 across the low velocity region as above yields 24 u sub u 2 1 c 1 g l s in which u sub 1 l s l s 0 udz is the depth averaged velocity in the low velocity region of penetration height and τ 0 τ b ρ g h s for steady and uniform surface flow the approximation of l s 0 u 2 d z c u sub 2 is assumed as order one lamb 2017a in which c is an order one constant when the average kinetic energy of the water flow is larger more energy is transmitted to the low velocity region within the roughness elements through the kh instability vortexes and the more obvious the increase of u sub the fluid inertial force expressed by the forchheimer term increases as the velocity in the porous media increases caused by the kh instability vortexes the viscous turbulent shear stress is also raised as the distortion of fluid velocity in porous media increases the relative magnitude of the inertial and viscous turbulent shear stresses in this flow can been evaluated using the flow reynolds number re the near bottom water flow develops into a highly mixed turbulent flow and the mutual perturbation between the vortexes transmitted to the theoretical surface bed is enhanced this flow in the low velocity regime is easily form a supercritical condition due to the shallow water and large roughness elements the lift force acting on the vortex body in supercritical flow is further pushed within roughness elements to increase u sub the flow condition can been evaluated by the flow froude number fr therefore the right hand side of eq 24 can been expressed by the flow reynolds number and the froude number as u sub u ζ re f r the velocity at the theoretical surface bed can be treated as a dimensional quantity by scaling u 0 to the characteristic velocity in the subsurface layer u sub assuming that the dimensionless velocity at the reference bed shows similarity with respect to the hydraulic radius r the following asymptotic power law is defined 25 u 0 u sub m r l s n then by substituting u sub u into eq 25 c u can be further expressed using the 18 experimental measurements and the following equation is obtained 26 u 0 u c u m r l s n re p exp f r in which the constants m n and p are respectively 0 35 1 0 and 0 44 the linear regression model has a coefficient of determination equal to 0 881 using the measurements corresponding to the 18 investigated runs the comparison between the measured and calculated c u is illustrated in fig 9 finally substituting eq 26 into eq 22 the proposed multivariable flow resistance equation is obtained 27 u u 0 7 r l s 1 1 re 0 33 exp f r 1 l s h ln cosh h l s k s l s cosh k s l s the experimental data is substituted into eq 21 to obtain the value of l s and then into eq 27 to evaluate the calculated friction factor 8 f 0 5 the comparison between the measured and calculated values is shown in fig 10 in detail the coefficient of determination is equal to 0 841 and the relative error which is defined as the ratio of the absolute value of the difference between the measured value and the calculated value to the measured value is 6 91 5 discussions 5 1 field data calibration the two key variables the shear strength l s and the difference coefficient c u of the multivariable mixing layer analogy approach are evaluated using laboratory data in comparison with field studies laboratory experiments are usually performed under well controlled flow and bed conditions for further calibrating the applicability and accuracy of eq 27 a total of 104 sets of field measured data from shallow gravel bed sources in 40 different rivers which are previously published are compiled simi 1925 1950 colosimo et al 1988 ferro and porto 2018 the flow measurements are carried out during low flow conditions reflecting the complexity of the gravel bed in shallow flow in particular these measurements are chosen based on the assumption of quasi uniform flow conditions over straight reaches and the surface bed material is sampled using wolman s grid by a number sampling procedure the detail range of fr re h and d 84 encountered in these data sets are also presented in table 3 the average relative submergence h k s from three independent gravel bed sources are respectively 2 8 5 6 and 11 1 this range completely contains large scale roughness transition and small scale roughness conditions classified by bathurst et al 1981 and extends the experimental simulation sequences as illustrated in table 4 in this study the large scale roughness condition including large scale and transition conditions h d 84 4 are confirmed in addition the single mixing layer analogy approach in eq 14 proposed by katul et al 2002 and the standard semi empirical equations in eq 6 proposed by hey 1979 are chosen as reference models in these equations the value of k s is the grain roughness which is approximately equal to the diameter of the boundary sediment and equal to d 84 in non uniform sediment data sets additionally due to the non uniformity of sediment in natural streams the sediment accumulation is much denser with stronger permeability than in the flume experiments turbulence near the gravel bed is expected to reduce as the interaction with the water surface diminishes the strength and size of the gravel scale vortices the gravel scale turbulence does not penetrate to the entire d 84 for gravel bed streams so the coefficient constants in the natural streams are different from the constants for experimental data the best fitting constants m n and p for the 104 field data sets are respectively calibrated as 0 7 and 1 1 and 0 33 the comparison between the measured and calculated c u as illustrated in fig 11 it should be noted that the average value of the calculated c u is equal to 4 7 which is in middle of the values of 3 3 katul et al 1988 and 5 8 wiberg and smith 1991 specified for rough wall boundary layer flows and slightly greater than the value of 4 5 proposed by katul et al 2002 in shallow streams moreover the similarly derived eq 14 based on the concept of the mixed layer is optimized by introducing a difference coefficient c u that varies with flow conditions such as supercritical subcritical or critical in eq 26 the instability that can penetrate the entire d 84 for gravel bed streams as proposed by katul et al is also used which is verified since the roughness concentration is distributed within the lower 20 of d 84 therefore l s in eq 27 is replaced by d 84 and the constant n should be adjusted for best fitting due to the change of penetration length the optimized katul equation becomes 28 8 f 0 7 r l s 1 3 re 0 33 exp f r 1 d 84 h ln cosh 1 h d 84 cosh 1 the final comparisons with four different flow resistance equations for the data is shown in fig 12 in most gravel beds with low relative submergence the flow resistance is generally 1 and small values cause many errors in predicting processes according to fig 12 the slight agreement between the measured and calculated values of the darcy weisbach friction factor using the hey standard logarithmic formulation eq 6 and a katul single variable mixing layer formulation eq 14 is demonstrated which suggests that these deduced formulations might be not be applicable for gravel beds with low relative submergence in fig 12 a and b the calculated values are larger than measured in the range of 8 f 0 5 7 and smaller in the range of 8 f 0 5 9 fig 12 c shows good agreement between the measured 8 f 0 5 values and those calculated by eq 27 which confirms the accuracy of this flow resistance estimate criterion fig 12 d shows a significant improvement as compared with fig 12 b and eq 14 by introducing the difference coefficient c u the mean relative error between the measured and calculated values is reduced from 70 using eqs 6 and 14 to 17 9 using eq 27 and 26 4 using eq 28 however it must be said that the smaller the river resistance the larger the error which is shown when the measured value deviates from the calculated value by about 10 in fig 12 c and by about 40 in fig 12 d when 8 f 0 5 10 the reasonable interpretation is that the mixing layer cannot be developed without velocity gradient deduced by large speed and not submerged flow in fig 12 c and d the calculated accuracy 8 f 0 5 is lower at low resistance of smaller discharge but improves considerably with increasing flows fortunately high discharge conditions are more useful for most engineering purposes as they control both flood hazards and sediment transport 5 2 comparison of flow resistance equations in many processes of predicted model development quantitative statistics are the key to evaluating the performance of a model or equation the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nsei and root mean square error rmse are widely reliable statistics used for assessing the goodness of fit of hydrological models mccuen et al 2006 the nsei indicates the strength of the agreement between the measured data the predicted data and the 1 1 line according to the following function 29 nsei 1 i 1 i n y i y i 2 i 1 i n y i y i 2 in which y i and y i are the predicted and measured values of the dependent variable y respectively y i denotes the mean measured values of y and n is the sample size this index has a value of 0 to 1 0 when the predictions of a linear model are accurate and a negative index can be produced if the predictions of the model are inaccurate the rmse describes the difference between model predictions and actual variables in units of variables and is calculated by 30 rmse i 1 i n y i y i 2 n using eqs 29 and 30 the fitting effect can be calculated by quantitative statistics as illustrated in table 5 the results show that of the three approaches the model using the mixing layer is better than logarithmic formulation the approach with the smallest rmse and nsei closest to 1 is the model from eq 27 proposed by this study which suggests good fit to assess the flow resistance in low submergence streams with gravel and cobble beds in addition the optimized katul equation eq 28 has a smaller rmse and larger nsei than before eq 14 significantly showing good optimization the multivariable mixing layer analogy is developed to reproduce flow resistance formulation for low submergence streams with gravel and cobble beds although it is more complex and requires more input variables the approach is more accurate than the hey semi empirical equation or the katul signal variable mixing layer equation furthermore the derivation of this approach is not completely different from others based on the classical boundary layer analogy which indicates that the interaction between the roughness element and the fluid causing the resistance is consistent with the mixing layer analogy 6 conclusions how to accurately determine the flow resistance in many natural streams especially in gravel bed streams of mountainous regimes with low relative submergence is still a fascinating problem in all ages in this study the flow resistance of gravel bed streams with low relative submergence in mountainous rivers is reproduced based on the completely different view as an analogy from the mixing layer which leads to free shear instabilities between the different velocity fluid layers to determine the physical rationality and accuracy of the analogy the values of statistical flow properties in laboratory experiments with different relative submergence are conducted showing that the roughness of shallow flow turbulence is closer to standard values in a mixing layer than in a surface layer the multivariable mixing layer analogy law which relates the shear strength l s applying an incomplete self similarity analysis for the dimensionless groups and difference coefficient c u using a simplified darcy forchheimer brinkman equation the final formulations of two key parameters are expressed and tested using laboratory experimental data using more available measurements in 104 field data the multivariable mixing layer equation is calibrated for denser natural gravel beds the good agreement of darcy weisbach friction factor using the multivariable mixing layer analogy equation is supported by a closer 1 nash sutcliffe index and smaller root mean square error also the developed equation is slightly more accurate than the hey standard semi empirical equation and the katul signal variable mixing layer analogy equation showing the lowest relative error additionally the optimized katul equation introducing the proposed coefficient c u also performs significantly better than the previous single variable mixing layer equation in conclusion the results obtained in this study encourage the use of the mixing layer in this research field and suggest that future work can take the advantage of this approach to investigate the s shaped velocity distribution in rough

5249,ecosystems at the junctions of large lakes and rivers are a significant resource which are yet susceptible to changes in the various water bodies one of the most crucial river lake junction points in china is the junction of poyang lake and the yangtze river jplyr with the three gorges dam tgd upstream based on remote sensing images of the dry season from 1987 to 2018 landcover change of jplyr was obtained using the random forest classification method linear regression principal component analysis pca and classification and regression tree cart were used to determine relationships between 16 hydrological variables regarding magnitude duration timing variation and vegetation area throughout different operational stages of the tgd results showed that the operation of the tgd has anticipated and elongated the dry seasons with a consequential shortening of the flood seasons that now occur later in the year the peak water level was significantly reduced p 0 05 while the minimum water level remained unchanged throughout the study period there was a 344 increase in vegetation coverage across the jplyr from 1987 0 677 km2 to 2018 3 005 km2 the earlier beginning of dry season bds was found to be most significant in affecting the increased vegetation area before and after the operation of tgd the results provide an essential reference for assessing the potential influence of newly proposed dams in river lake junctions and for optimizing future operations keywords wetland vegetation water level fluctuations river lake junction poyang lake yangtze river 1 introduction great rivers and their connecting lakes are a complex system of interaction characterized by a strong hydraulic exchange lai et al 2014a due to the uneven spatial distribution of precipitation the inconsistency of the water level fluctuations between rivers and lakes usually leads to complicated water exchanges across the region tan et al 2019 some of the most significant environmental effects of water exchange are the lake level fluctuation and spatial heterogeneity of environmental factors along the hydrological gradient such as vegetation distribution chapin and paige 2013 and nutrient accumulation wang et al 2016 in closed like systems the amount of precipitation does not significantly affect water level fluctuations and the occurrence of plants is mainly controlled by nutrients within the lake water lauridsen et al 2015 conversely in naturally connected lakes the lake level duration and frequency of floods and droughts and the rate and timing of wetting and drying cycles have a strong influence on the land cover types community diversity productivity and vegetation succession geest et al 2005 santos and thomaz 2008 for example wetland species distribute along the water level gradient mainly due to their distinct responses to the water level fluctuations and their different competitiveness tan et al 2016 zhang et al 2012a casanova and brock s 2000 experiments also show that depth duration and frequency of inundation significantly influenced the vegetation community with depth being the least important previous studies demonstrated that in connected lakes hydrological processes are crucial in controlling vegetation dynamics however little has been published on river lake junctions which are the critical spatial node affected by both rivers and lakes ecological factors in the river lake junctions such as water regimes and vegetation are fragile because of the continuously changing water sediment exchange relationship between the river and naturally connected lakes lai et al 2014a guo et al 2018 changes in river lake junctions within the last century may have modified the overall river lake ecosystems wu 2001 therefore it is necessary to quantify vegetation evolution induced by water fluctuations in river lake junctions to provide insights that can help ecological management and services the yangtze river is the longest river 6300 km in asia and has a watershed of 1 8 106 km2 it ranks fourth worldwide in terms of water discharge which is about 900 km3year 1 gao et al 2014 historically lakes in the yangtze river basin were densely distributed and naturally connected by the yangtze river currently only two lakes are naturally connected with the yangtze river namely poyang lake and dongting lake poyang lake is both a typical floodplain lake and the largest freshwater lake in china it receives water from five tributaries and discharges into the yangtze river at the junction of poyang lake and the yangtze river jplyr according to data in common water year 2010 the annual water volume flowing to the yangtze river from poyang lake was about 2 17 1011m3 due to the periodic high flow in the yangtze river about 1 06 1010m3 of water flowed back into poyang lake from the river accordingly about 1 53 107 tons of sediment was transported from the lake to the river and about 1 89 106 tons of sediment flowed back into the lake from the river during these periods of high flow within the river wang et al 2014 such hydraulic connections between poyang lake and the yangtze river have dramatically shifted lai et al 2014c wang et al 2019 hu et al 2007 the water flow at the hukou station and water flow from the yangtze river to poyang lake have been decreasing over the past several decades which increases the hydraulic gradient and subsequently increases the lake outflow at the hukou station zhang et al 2012b in turn poyang lake has suffered a series of droughts in recent years due to the decreased inflow and increased outflow into the yangtze river the dry season has been occurring earlier and extends every year ye et al 2014 the high floodplain plant communities such as the phragmites triarrhena and artemisia cynodon are moving towards to lake center han et al 2018 and vital wetland landscapes such as migratory birds habitats are now fragmented wu et al 2017 all of the above findings are based on poyang lake but the jplyr has not been the focus of previous studies which is more vulnerable to the changes in the hydraulic connections due to its particular location the jpyr is also crucial for the whole river lake system because wetland changes in the jplyr may trigger significant variation in the hydraulic connections and change the poyang lake level notably there have been two catastrophic expansions of poyang lake during the ming and qing dynasties which were related to the eastward expansion of wetlands in the jplyr wu 2001 however due to the lack of high resolution of vegetation coverage data to date long term records of vegetation in the jplyr remain unavailable not to mention how exactly they are affected by water level fluctuations the three gorges dam tgd located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river is the world s largest hydroelectric dam fig 1 a the impoundment of the tgd benefits the yangtze river basin by providing flood control electricity generation and shipping access despite the significant benefits of this project it has been controversial concerning its eco environmental influences on downstream areas since its proposal in 1919 cheng et al 2018 huang et al 2019 several studies indicated that the impoundment of tgd during the dry season might lead to low water levels in the river downstream thus increasing the drainage of the lake emptying effect which results in prolonged exposure of the lake and river bottom wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2012b this provides more favorable conditions for wetland vegetation growth han et al 2018 feng et al 2016 other studies indicated that the water regime changes of the poyang lake system are mainly caused by human activities such as sand mining and returning farmland to lake lai et al 2013 2014b the degree of impact of tgd on the ecosystems of poyang lake is not yet clear jplyr which located at the outlet of poyang lake and connected with the yangtze river is considered to be more vulnerable to hydraulic projects such as the tgd compared with other areas of poyang lake lai et al 2014c therefore the influence of tgd on the poyang lake ecosystem might be magnified and prominent in jplyr and eco changes in jplyr might suggest the potential influence of tgd on poyang lake as a whole it is hypothesized that the operation of tgd may have changed the hydrological processes downstream leading to changes in the inundation condition in the jplyr and thus affecting the vegetation distribution pattern to date this hypothesis has not rigorously been tested with existing data we collected daily water level data to facilitate a hydrological analysis in addition remote sensing data which offers valuable information on the spatial and temporal changes of vegetation coverage was used to study the vegetation evolution in the jplyr over the last three decades and to analyze its relationships with hydrological variables the aim of this study is to 1 investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of vegetation in jplyr 2 determine the relationships between vegetation coverage and hydrological variables and 3 further understand the influence of the tgd impoundment on jplyr 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake is located in northern jiangxi province 28 22 29 45 n and 115 47 116 45 e it receives water from five tributaries the gan river fu river xin river rao river and xiu river then discharges into the yangtze river at the jplyr fig 1 due to its connectivity and seasonal variation of precipitation resulting from the east asian monsoon climate the water level fluctuates and lake area vary dramatically throughout the year hu et al 2007 zonal distribution of vegetation communities along elevation exists in the poyang lake wetlands during the low flow period with the optimum elevation as follows artemisia cynodon community 14 3 m phragmites triarrhena community 13 2 m carex phalaris community 12 5 m tan et al 2016 an extensive wetland has developed due to the dramatic water level fluctuations and maintains high plant richness and diversity wang et al 2016 poyang lake provides significant environmental benefits such as supplying water maintaining biodiversity and providing habitats for migratory birds du et al 2017 the jplyr consists of the guanzhou meijiazhou and xinzhou wetlands and is located at the northern region of poyang lake between latitudes 28 41 6 and 29 47 34 80 and longitudes 116 6 43 19 and 116 15 14 38 e fig 1c guanzhou meijiazhou and xinzhou wetlands experience significant seasonal water level fluctuations of more than 10 m which exposes mudflats and vegetation during the dry season october to may of the following year and submerges the area during the flood season june to september consistent with poyang lake wetlands the artemisia cynodon community phragmites triarrhena community and carex phalaris community are distributed across the wetlands of jplyr along elevation from high to low these plants germinate to form wetland plants during the dry season but die when submerged during the flood season overall the poyang lake wetlands and jplyr have similar vegetation communities and dynamics 2 2 tgd operation and study period division the tgd was proposed as early as 1919 but was not constructed until 1993 the tgd was completed and began operation in may 2003 and water ahead of the dam was raised from 67 m to 135 m the highest water level in the dam reservoir remained unchanged at a level of 135 m from 2003 to 2005 during the second phase of the pilot operation of the tgd 2006 2008 the water level was raised from 135 m to 156 m in the third pilot phase 2008 2009 the water level reached 172 m since 2010 the tgd has been in regular operation and the highest water level has reached 175 m the tgd stores and flushes water seasonally and regularly and follows a scheme of storing water during the dry season and releasing water during the wet season the increasing water levels decrease the outflow of the dam to lower reaches of the river during the dry season and decreasing the water levels during the wet season requires a more massive outflow to the lower reaches lyu et al 2018 since regular operation of the tgd in 2010 the water level in the dam reservoir has been maintained at a low level 145 m between june and september wet season for flood control and at the end of september the tgd reduces outflow to raise the water level in the reservoir for power generation the water level dose not reach 175 m until november and is maintained at 175 m from november to january in the next year since january in order to maintain standard power generation during the low flow period the tgd increases outflow thus continuously decreases the water level in the reservoir until 145 m is reached until june when the wet season begins guo et al 2018 the operation of tgd ensures flood prevention during the wet season and maintains adequate water levels during the dry season for consistent power generation in the region in order to better understand the influence of tgd on jplyr a period of 32 years 1987 through 2018 was divided according to the construction and operation of tgd the year of 1987 1993 is defined as the preparatory construction stage pcs because the actual construction of tgd started in 1993 the project was completed in 2002 so the year of 1994 2002 is defined as the construction stage cs tgd started operation in 2003 and the highest water level in the reservoir gradually increased between 2003 and 2009 so years from 2003 to 2009 are defined as the early impoundment stage eis since 2010 tgd has been in regular operation and the highest water level reached 175 m for the first time and has remained unchanged the period from 2010 to 2018 is known as the impoundment stage is guo et al 2018 table 1 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 vegetation data extraction from landsat imagery multispectral images of the study area were acquired from landsat 5 tm n 23 and landsat 8 operational land imager n 6 path number 120 121 row number 39 40 for the period of the dry season a total of 29 landsat images taken during november and december from 1987 to 2018 were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs https glovis usgs gov app these years 1997 2011 2012 when hydrological variables without vegetation being present were also excluded the 29 high quality landsat images were pre processed using envi v 5 3 exelis vis boulder co usa including geographic correction radiometric correction flaash fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes atmosphere correction and image subset mosaicking all images had the same universal transverse mercator utm coordinates based on the world geodetic system 1984 wgs 84 knorn et al 2009 wetlands in the jplyr area were classified into four areas water vegetation mudflat and unclassified unclassified areas were mainly those disturbed by human activities random forest rf classification breiman 2001 a machine learning ensemble algorithm based on decision tree classifiers was used to classify the landsat images the details of rf can be found elsewhere cutler et al 2004 na et al 2010 default parameter setting number of trees 500 node number q where q equals the number of predictor variables within a dataset was optimal according to the out of bag oob chart the rf model was implemented using the package randomforestclassification in envi v5 3 the classification maps were validated using 556 ground truth points from a field survey conducted in december 2018 a standard error matrix overall classification accuracies and kappa chance correction statistics were used to determine map accuracy congalton and green 1998 the overall accuracy for the classification conducted on the landsat imagery from 2018 reached 99 82 table 2 therefore meeting the requirements for inclusion in this research changes in the jplyr land cover types before and after the impoundment of the tgd were analyzed using a wetland transition map the superimposed images were taken in the beginning of the cs 1994 and the final observation year 2018 respectively and the difference between the water levels of the two images was less than 0 3 m the areas of each land cover type were calculated for each landsat classification image to quantify the changes of the jplyr wetlands over the last three decades spatial analysis and raster calculations were completed in arcgis v 10 2 2 3 2 hydrological analysis daily water level data collected at the hukou gauge station located at jplyr between 1987 and 2018 were used to represent the poyang lake estuary water levels in this study daily hydrological data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province and the changjiang water resources commission hydrological data were continuous with no missing values but vegetation data were discontinuous with values in 1997 2011 and 2012 missing thus in this study hydrological data in 1997 2011 and 2012 were excluded for the consistency with the vegetation data hydrological variables regarding magnitude duration timing and variation were selected for this study according to the definition of water regime casanova and brock 2000 dai et al 2016 the current study focuses on the distribution of wetland plants which typically have annual cycles due to dramatic and regular seasonal water level fluctuations dai et al 2016 hence the time scale of the water level fluctuation in this study was limited to an ecological range from daily to annual measurements the highest annual water level hawl average annual water level aawl and the lowest annual water level lawl which indicate the extreme and average hydrological conditions of the year may relate to the tolerance limit and optimal range of water level fluctuation for vegetation you et al 2015 in addition vegetation distribution may be affected by water level fluctuations for the preceding periods dai et al 2016 thus the antecedent water level index awi which refers to the hydrological condition in a period of time before remote sensing image shooting was applied as the hydrological variables furthermore factors indicating droughts and floods such as beginning of the dry flood season bds bfs and duration of the dry flood season dds fd 17 m and fd 19 m were also found crucial in affecting vegetation distribution in poyang lake han et al 2018 in order to analyze the possible alteration of various water level fluctuation patterns a total of 16 variables indicating magnitude duration of flood dry season arrival time of flood dry season and variation were selected in this study table 3 trends in the 16 hydrological variables over last three decades were determined using the mann kendall mk trend test which is a non parametric test that is widely used in hydro ecology to investigate the time trends of variables hamed and rao 1998 when using the mk trend test hamed and rao 1998 suggested a null hypothesis that there is no trend at the 95 confidence level if mk 0 the trend is considered to be decreasing and if mk 0 it is considered to be increasing the mean range and standard deviation sd of hydrological variables and vegetation area during the four stages e g pcs cs eis and is were calculated differences in all variables between the four stages of the tgd were determined by one way anova differences between means were tested by tukey s test with post hoc multiple comparisons the linear relationships between the area of vegetation and hydrological variables were analyzed by simple linear regression with a one tailed significance test to determine the significance level of the fitting results beta is the slope of linear relationships between hydrological variables and vegetation values of the coefficient of determination r2 adj ranged from 0 to 1 which indicate the strength of the linear relationship between the variables with large values indicating stronger relationships the above analyses including the mk trend test one way anova tukey s test and simple linear regression were conducted using spss 13 0 statistical software only p values less than 0 05 were considered statistically significant 2 3 3 pca analysis hydrological variables and vegetation data were sorted using principal component analysis pca with varimax rotation factor loadings represent the nature of variation any factor with an eigenvalue greater than unity was selected as significant hydrological variables and vegetation data were tested for pca constraints 2 3 4 classification and regression tree cart classification and regression tree cart was used to determine the multivariate non linear relations between hydrological variables and vegetation coverage cart is a non parametric data mining technique that can reflect non linear and non additive relationships between the response variables and predictor variables it uses recursive partitioning to separate the data into subset so that the records with each subset are more homogeneous than in the previous one the final result resembles an inverted tree structure as a sequence of simple yes no questions however as with stepwise linear regression procedures adding variables will continuously increase the fit of the model to the data but at the cost of increasing the true fit to an independent dataset therefore an optimal tree is the smallest tree whose misclassification risk is not much higher than that of the largest tree the minimal cost complexity pruning method was used in this study to measure and reduce the complexity and misclassification risk and retain only a simple and robust tree details of cart are published elsewhere faller and mccleery 2017 speybroeck 2012 cart can indicate the importance of predictor variables and associated threshold for the prediction of the response variable and can help gain insight into the splitting process 3 results 3 1 water level fluctuation at the hukou station according to fig 2 and the mk analysis varying degrees of changes in the magnitude of water level fluctuations in the jplyr were found significant decreases occurred in awi day 25 p 0 05 mk 1 96 and awi day 30 p 0 03 mk 02 12 smaller changes p 0 05 were found in hawl lawl aawl awi day 5 awi day 10 awi day 15 and awi day 20 with the mk values of 1 44 0 75 1 86 1 59 1 71 1 67 1 75 respectively this suggests that all hydrological variables except for lawl have suffered a decline over the past three decades as for duration a significant increase was found in dds p 0 00 mk 2 95 and no significant decreases p 0 05 were found in fd 17 m and fd 19 m with mk values of 1 62 and 1 42 respectively as for beginning of dry season flood season a significant decrease was found in bds p 0 00 mk 3 25 while no significant increase was found in bfs p 0 40 mk 0 85 no significant changes were found in rov p 0 12 mk 1 58 and cov p 0 30 mk 1 03 either overall the region is experiencing increases in aridity in the jplyr 3 2 land cover changes in the jplyr land cover types in the jplyr include water mudflats vegetation and unclassified fig 3 the vegetation area increased significantly p 0 05 from 1987 to 2018 and the coverage area increased by 2 328 km2 from 1987 0 677 km2 to 2018 3 005 km2 fig 4 a the ratio of vegetation area to the total area of vegetation and mudflats is shown in fig 4b the mudflat has transitioned into vegetation and vice versa during the dry seasons from 1987 to 2018 however both the mudflat and vegetation disappeared during the floods the vegetation ratio increased from 1987 to 2018 with the value peaking at 0 76 in 2015 the second highest vegetation ratio 0 72 was observed in 2000 while the lowest 0 09 was observed in 1990 according to the transition map fig 5 the most dramatic change occurred in the guanzhou wetland where 43 of the mudflats 1 012 km2 and 2 of the water 0 127 km2 transitioned into vegetation over all there has been a 611 increase in vegetation in the guanzhou wetland from 1994 0 186 km2 to 2018 1 325 km2 the transformation of vegetation to water or mudflat did not occur 21 of mudflat 0 383 km2 and 1 of water 0 053 km2 transformed into vegetation in the meijiazhou wetland few areas of vegetation 0 002 km2 transformed into water or mudflat over all vegetation in meijiazhou increased by 121 from 1994 0 359 km2 to 2018 0 793 km2 the transformation in the xinzhou wetland was not remarkable because the wetland is very small 3 534 km2 compared to the guanzhou 9 464 km2 and meijiazhou 9 424 km2 wetlands in the xinzhou wetland only 8 0 041 km2 of the mudflat and 2 0 051 km2 of the water transitioned into vegetation moreover 73 0 171 km2 of the vegetation transitioned into water and mudflat overall 1 667 km2 of the mudflat and water transformed into vegetation but only an area of 0 173 km2 of vegetation transformed into water or mudflat across the three wetlands the most remarkable increase in vegetation was observed in the guanzhou wetland 3 3 relationships between hydrological variables and landcover linear relationships between hydrological variables and vegetation areas were explored using simple linear regression table 4 significant relationships p 0 05 were found between the vegetation area va and most hydrological variables indicating magnitude it is worth noting that very weak linear relationships were found between lawl and va p 0 248 r2 adj 0 014 as for the duration of floods or droughts dds closely correlated to va p 0 007 r2 adj 0 208 while fd 17 m and fd 19 m weakly related with va p 0 05 the most significant relationships corresponding to the timing of water level changes were found between bds and va p 0 001 r2 adj 0 328 while no significant correlations were found between bfs and va p 0 664 r2 adj 0 03 as for variation of water level fluctuations significant correlations were found between rov and va p 0 027 r2 adj 0 138 while no significant correlations were found between cov and va p 0 300 r2 adj 0 004 all hydrological variables indicating low flow events except for lawl were found to be significantly correlated to va p 0 05 pca sorted the variables of va and the 16 hydrological variables based on the dataset of the last three decades table 5 lists the significant factors eigenvalue 1 and the pca loading matrix fig 6 shows the plot of the loadings of the first two factors the three significant factors accounted for 82 97 of the total variation with eigenvalues of 2 77 for factor 1 2 17 for factor 2 and 1 29 for factor 3 the first factor accounted for 45 15 of the total variation which positively related to hawl aawl awi day 5 10 15 20 25 30 fd 17 m and bds however it negatively related to dds and va factor 2 accounted for 27 92 of the total variance which positively related to awi day 5 10 15 20 25 30 dds and bfs but negatively related to hawl aawl fd 17 m fd 19 m and rov factor 3 accounted for 9 90 of the total variance which positively related to lawl and va but negatively related to bfs and bds table 5 the input of the cart model included va and 16 predictor variables a simple and robust tree was obtained when cost complexity cp was set to 0 1 bds lawl and awi day 15 finally entered into the cart model and among these hydrological variables bds had the most significant impact on the variation of va fig 7 shows the results from the application of the cart model the 293 day threshold was acquired from the results of cart model when bds was later than the 293rd day of the year changes in the distribution of vegetation were mainly dependent on awi day 15 when the average water level for the preceding 15 days was higher than 9 4 m vegetation would experience a dramatic decline by approximately 0 996 km2 otherwise when water levels were less than 9 4 m the average va would encompass an area greater than 2 206 km2 when bds came earlier than the 293rd day of the year changes in vegetation were mainly determined by lawl when lawl was less than 7 2 m a relatively low va area about 1 396 km2 was observed when lawl was greater than 7 2 m va would experience an evident increase by approximately 2 764 km2 3 4 the influence of the tgd on hydrological variables and vegetation the differences between the 16 hydrological variables and va across the four tgd stages were calculated to determine the potential influence of the tgd on wetland vegetation fig 8 overall the magnitude of water level has decreased over the past three decades significant changes p 0 05 were found in hawl and aawl which decreased by 2 4 m and 1 3 m respectively during eis compared to that during cs moreover awi day 10 15 20 25 30 during is was significantly lower p 0 05 than during pcs however lawl and awi day 5 remained unchanged throughout the past four stages significant changes in the duration of water level fluctuation p 0 05 were observed between cs and eis an average value of fd 17 m and fd 19 m decreased by 44 days and 33 days in eis compared with cs and dds increased by 44 days there were also significant changes in the timing of water level fluctuations bfs during eis came approximately 26 days later than during pcs p 0 05 and bds during eis came approximately 25 days earlier than during cs p 0 05 a significant decrease in the variation of water level fluctuations p 0 05 of rov was observed between cs and eis with a value of 2 1 m no significant changes were found in cov between the four stages significant increases p 0 05 of va were found between all four stages with increases of 0 310 km2 0 750 km2 and 1 445 km2 respectively from pcs to is remarkable drought trends and apparent increases in the vegetation area were found in the region especially after the impoundment of tgd relationships between the hydrological variables and vegetation coverage among the four tgd stages were analyzed using simple linear regression table 6 as for relationships between va and the magnitude of the water level fluctuations r2 adj of linear regressions between va and awi day 5 10 15 20 25 30 in pcs were 0 3 but subsequently dropped below 0 2 during cs eis and is hawl aawl and lawl had limited influence p 0 05 on the va among the four stages overall flood events e g fd 17 m and fd 19 m did not significantly influence the vegetation distribution pattern p 0 05 relationship p 0 05 between dds and va was only significant during cs overall bds was significant p 0 05 in affecting va during all four stages while bfs was not significant p 0 05 during any stage rov and cov which indicate variations in water level fluctuations had weak relationships with va p 0 05 during all four stages of tgd in summary relationships between the hydrological variables and va varied between stages of tgd but bds was always the most significant hydrological variable in affecting va throughout all four stages 4 discussion 4 1 land cover changes in the jplyr related to hydrological variables there has been a dramatic increase in vegetation coverage in the jplyr over the last thirty years p 0 00 mk 6 08 the vegetation area in 1987 was only 0 677 km2 and increased by 344 in 2018 to 3 005 km2 although increases were also found in other areas of poyang lake the rates of increase were much slower you et al 2015 found a 58 increase in vegetation area in the delta wetland of poyang lake near the gan river during the dry season from 1996 to 2009 a 186 increase in vegetation area was observed in the national nature reserve of poyang lake from 2000 to 2014 han et al 2018 several studies have shown that the increase rate in vegetation area in poyang lake has been slowed down since around 2010 han et al 2018 ye et al 2019 compared with poyang lake the growth rate of vegetation in the jplyr was much faster relationships between vegetation and hydrological variables in poyang lake have been discussed for many years you et al 2015 tan et al 2016 however in the jplyr this issue is now discussed for the first time linear and non linear relationships between the 16 hydrological variables and va were analyzed based on simple linear regression pca and cart model and bds was determined to be the most significant factor in our study water levels at jplyr reach their peak during summer and reach their minimum during autumn and winter to cope with the fluctuation in the water level vegetation communities in jplyr have formed their own adaptive characteristics and strategies cui et al 2000 plants in jplyr germinate in spring but then are destroyed by floods in summer and can not restore until the floods recede in the autumn usually at the end of october when the daily average temperature is about 20 and yet the daylight is still up to 10 h per day guan et al 1987 therefore inundations become the only limiting factor to control the vegetation growth operation of the tgd causes an earlier arrival of bds allowing for the wetlands to be exposed in advance which provides an aerobic environment for the soil seed bank in the lower beaches to germinate adequate water light and heat in jplyr provide the wetlands a suitable environment for vegetation to grow ye et al 2019 in addition although the spatial extension of agriculture activities has not expanded the increasing use of fertilizers in recent decades may have increased fertilizer leakage and promote the increase in vegetation coverage these above mentioned reasons may explain the dramatic increase of vegetation in jplyr over the last three decades it is worth noting that lawl is not significant p 0 248 in simple regression model but is rather important in cart according to fig 7 the influence of lawl on va was driven by bds specifically when bds was earlier than 293rd day of the year and lawl was less than 7 2 m vegetation in jplyr would be stressed and va would have a coverage area of only 1 396 km2 however if lawl was greater than 7 2 m with the bds still occurred before the 293rd day of the year the habitat conditions would be most suitable for vegetation and the average va would cover an area of approximately 2 764 km2 this suggests that the influence of lawl on va is non linear and indirect the above results differ from those of you et al 2015 on poyang lake which indicated that lawl was significantly negatively correlated to va compared with poyang lake the processes of rising and falling water in the jplyr are faster due to the open terrain and steeper slopes in addition sediment particles are larger because of the faster water velocity of the yangtze river wang et al 2018 thus the loss of soil water is also faster after the wetlands are exposed therefore vegetation in the jplyr might be more vulnerable to extreme drought nevertheless lawl does not stress vegetation when it does not exceed a certain threshold 7 2 m as indicated in fig 7 4 2 influence of the tgd on the jilyr since the construction of the tgd many scientific research programs have been set up to predict and examine the potential impacts of the dam on upstream and downstream ecosystems the dam has resulted in significant changes to the river system including poyang lake zhang et al 2012b guo et al 2018 the impoundment of the tgd decreases the discharge and lowers the water level of the yangtze river and the hydraulic gradient has passively increased in the jplyr thus accelerated the drainage of poyang lake zhang et al 2012b cheng et al 2018 it is worth noting that the influence of the tgd on poyang lake decreases from north to south across the lake lai et al 2013 jplyr is located in the northern most section of poyang lake and is the area most affected by tgd by considering that ecological systems within the jplyr are similar to those existing at poyang lake we believe that the vegetation changes related to the water level fluctuations in the jplyr may provide predication and guidance on the potential impact of the tgd on poyang lake in jplyr most hydrological variables e g hawl aawl duration of floods and drought bds and rov significantly changed after eis p 0 05 the reduction of the flood frequency and decline of the peak lake water are due to the flood control of tgd from june to september wet season water levels ahead of the tgd are maintained at a low water level throughout the wet season sustaining a flood control volume available for river floods forming in the upper reaches zheng 2016 the presence of the dam has significantly reduced the water flowing from the yangtze river to poyang lake during this intense flooding period zheng 2016 therefore hawl fd 17 m and fd 19 m significantly decreased after eis after the end of september the tgd reduces the outflow and stores water for power generation until the water level reaches175 m guo et al 2018 this operation typically occurs one month ahead of the dry season of poyang lake water level downstream is then reduced and wetlands in the jplyr are exposed prematurely this may explain the significant p 0 05 earlier arrival of bds after eis furthermore lawl decreased at poyang lake lai et al 2014c but remained unchanged in the jplyr in our study which may indicate more substantial influence of the tgd on jplyr lawl appears during january and february when the tgd increases outflow to maintain power generation thus slightly increasing the lowest water level downstream lai et al 2013 the increasing effect of the tgd on lawl plus the drought trend allows for the water level to remain almost unchanged over the last thirty years therefore the decrease in rov is mainly caused by the reduction of the annual peak water level the responses of the jplyr to the tgd are very complex and vary over time and are in combination climate influences thus long term and periodic monitoring is necessary to understand the impacts of the tgd on downstream rivers and lakes relationships between hydrological variables and vegetation vary across the four stages of the tgd for example the average level for the preceding periods e g awi 5 10 15 20 25 30 days were found to closely correlate to va only during pcs dds was significantly p 0 05 related to va only during cs it is worth noting that the relationship between va and bds is significant based on different statistical methods and always significant in all substages of the tgd as previously mentioned bds is the most important hydrological variable affecting vegetation distribution in the jplyr because the dry season occurs earlier every year wetlands are exposed ahead of time which can provide a more suitable environment for vegetation in the lower beaches it appears that the operation of the tgd resembles the natural law of submergence and exposure of wetlands and the earlier exposed wetlands accelerate the expansion of vegetation in the region in this study the trend of change in hawl was not significant over the last three decades based on mk but a significant decrease in the hawl was found between cs and eis using one way anova lawl was not significant at all for affecting va according to simple linear regression but it was relatively important according to cart this might explain the different conclusions in previous studies regarding the hydro ecological process of poyang lake you et al 2015 dai et al 2016 even so significant changes in the bds and its significant influence on vegetation were found on different temporal scales using different statistical methods this correlation indicates the enormous impact of an earlier arrival of bds on vegetation which is caused by the impoundment of the tgd thus an appropriate periodic division according to milestones of important events is crucial in determining the mechanisms affecting these actions furthermore it is advisable to find the strongest influencing factors by comparing the results of different statistical methods xie et al 2019 5 conclusion we found that the vegetation coverage increased over the last three decades in the jplyr a decreased magnitude of water level fluctuations extended dry season shorter flood season earlier arrival of the dry season and later arrival of the flood season were observed after the impoundment of the tgd while the lawl remained almost unchanged low flow events were more important compared to high flow events in affecting vegetation in jplyr the bds was the most significant hydrological variable affecting the vegetation area we suggest that drought in the jplyr is conducive to vegetation expansion and that an earlier arrival of bds caused by the tgd is the leading cause for the increased vegetation the jplyr is of vital importance as an ecological indicator for poyang lake and the yangtze river system knowledge of changes in the landcover across the jplyr and their leading causes provide valuable guidance for improving the ecological service and comprehensive management of poyang lake the influence of an earlier arrival of the dry season in the jplyr is worth noting because the public perception is that shallow water levels contribute to increased vegetation in poyang lake more research is required on river lake junctions to provide a scientific basis to support sustainable management of river lake ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement lilin zheng

5249,ecosystems at the junctions of large lakes and rivers are a significant resource which are yet susceptible to changes in the various water bodies one of the most crucial river lake junction points in china is the junction of poyang lake and the yangtze river jplyr with the three gorges dam tgd upstream based on remote sensing images of the dry season from 1987 to 2018 landcover change of jplyr was obtained using the random forest classification method linear regression principal component analysis pca and classification and regression tree cart were used to determine relationships between 16 hydrological variables regarding magnitude duration timing variation and vegetation area throughout different operational stages of the tgd results showed that the operation of the tgd has anticipated and elongated the dry seasons with a consequential shortening of the flood seasons that now occur later in the year the peak water level was significantly reduced p 0 05 while the minimum water level remained unchanged throughout the study period there was a 344 increase in vegetation coverage across the jplyr from 1987 0 677 km2 to 2018 3 005 km2 the earlier beginning of dry season bds was found to be most significant in affecting the increased vegetation area before and after the operation of tgd the results provide an essential reference for assessing the potential influence of newly proposed dams in river lake junctions and for optimizing future operations keywords wetland vegetation water level fluctuations river lake junction poyang lake yangtze river 1 introduction great rivers and their connecting lakes are a complex system of interaction characterized by a strong hydraulic exchange lai et al 2014a due to the uneven spatial distribution of precipitation the inconsistency of the water level fluctuations between rivers and lakes usually leads to complicated water exchanges across the region tan et al 2019 some of the most significant environmental effects of water exchange are the lake level fluctuation and spatial heterogeneity of environmental factors along the hydrological gradient such as vegetation distribution chapin and paige 2013 and nutrient accumulation wang et al 2016 in closed like systems the amount of precipitation does not significantly affect water level fluctuations and the occurrence of plants is mainly controlled by nutrients within the lake water lauridsen et al 2015 conversely in naturally connected lakes the lake level duration and frequency of floods and droughts and the rate and timing of wetting and drying cycles have a strong influence on the land cover types community diversity productivity and vegetation succession geest et al 2005 santos and thomaz 2008 for example wetland species distribute along the water level gradient mainly due to their distinct responses to the water level fluctuations and their different competitiveness tan et al 2016 zhang et al 2012a casanova and brock s 2000 experiments also show that depth duration and frequency of inundation significantly influenced the vegetation community with depth being the least important previous studies demonstrated that in connected lakes hydrological processes are crucial in controlling vegetation dynamics however little has been published on river lake junctions which are the critical spatial node affected by both rivers and lakes ecological factors in the river lake junctions such as water regimes and vegetation are fragile because of the continuously changing water sediment exchange relationship between the river and naturally connected lakes lai et al 2014a guo et al 2018 changes in river lake junctions within the last century may have modified the overall river lake ecosystems wu 2001 therefore it is necessary to quantify vegetation evolution induced by water fluctuations in river lake junctions to provide insights that can help ecological management and services the yangtze river is the longest river 6300 km in asia and has a watershed of 1 8 106 km2 it ranks fourth worldwide in terms of water discharge which is about 900 km3year 1 gao et al 2014 historically lakes in the yangtze river basin were densely distributed and naturally connected by the yangtze river currently only two lakes are naturally connected with the yangtze river namely poyang lake and dongting lake poyang lake is both a typical floodplain lake and the largest freshwater lake in china it receives water from five tributaries and discharges into the yangtze river at the junction of poyang lake and the yangtze river jplyr according to data in common water year 2010 the annual water volume flowing to the yangtze river from poyang lake was about 2 17 1011m3 due to the periodic high flow in the yangtze river about 1 06 1010m3 of water flowed back into poyang lake from the river accordingly about 1 53 107 tons of sediment was transported from the lake to the river and about 1 89 106 tons of sediment flowed back into the lake from the river during these periods of high flow within the river wang et al 2014 such hydraulic connections between poyang lake and the yangtze river have dramatically shifted lai et al 2014c wang et al 2019 hu et al 2007 the water flow at the hukou station and water flow from the yangtze river to poyang lake have been decreasing over the past several decades which increases the hydraulic gradient and subsequently increases the lake outflow at the hukou station zhang et al 2012b in turn poyang lake has suffered a series of droughts in recent years due to the decreased inflow and increased outflow into the yangtze river the dry season has been occurring earlier and extends every year ye et al 2014 the high floodplain plant communities such as the phragmites triarrhena and artemisia cynodon are moving towards to lake center han et al 2018 and vital wetland landscapes such as migratory birds habitats are now fragmented wu et al 2017 all of the above findings are based on poyang lake but the jplyr has not been the focus of previous studies which is more vulnerable to the changes in the hydraulic connections due to its particular location the jpyr is also crucial for the whole river lake system because wetland changes in the jplyr may trigger significant variation in the hydraulic connections and change the poyang lake level notably there have been two catastrophic expansions of poyang lake during the ming and qing dynasties which were related to the eastward expansion of wetlands in the jplyr wu 2001 however due to the lack of high resolution of vegetation coverage data to date long term records of vegetation in the jplyr remain unavailable not to mention how exactly they are affected by water level fluctuations the three gorges dam tgd located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river is the world s largest hydroelectric dam fig 1 a the impoundment of the tgd benefits the yangtze river basin by providing flood control electricity generation and shipping access despite the significant benefits of this project it has been controversial concerning its eco environmental influences on downstream areas since its proposal in 1919 cheng et al 2018 huang et al 2019 several studies indicated that the impoundment of tgd during the dry season might lead to low water levels in the river downstream thus increasing the drainage of the lake emptying effect which results in prolonged exposure of the lake and river bottom wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2012b this provides more favorable conditions for wetland vegetation growth han et al 2018 feng et al 2016 other studies indicated that the water regime changes of the poyang lake system are mainly caused by human activities such as sand mining and returning farmland to lake lai et al 2013 2014b the degree of impact of tgd on the ecosystems of poyang lake is not yet clear jplyr which located at the outlet of poyang lake and connected with the yangtze river is considered to be more vulnerable to hydraulic projects such as the tgd compared with other areas of poyang lake lai et al 2014c therefore the influence of tgd on the poyang lake ecosystem might be magnified and prominent in jplyr and eco changes in jplyr might suggest the potential influence of tgd on poyang lake as a whole it is hypothesized that the operation of tgd may have changed the hydrological processes downstream leading to changes in the inundation condition in the jplyr and thus affecting the vegetation distribution pattern to date this hypothesis has not rigorously been tested with existing data we collected daily water level data to facilitate a hydrological analysis in addition remote sensing data which offers valuable information on the spatial and temporal changes of vegetation coverage was used to study the vegetation evolution in the jplyr over the last three decades and to analyze its relationships with hydrological variables the aim of this study is to 1 investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of vegetation in jplyr 2 determine the relationships between vegetation coverage and hydrological variables and 3 further understand the influence of the tgd impoundment on jplyr 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake is located in northern jiangxi province 28 22 29 45 n and 115 47 116 45 e it receives water from five tributaries the gan river fu river xin river rao river and xiu river then discharges into the yangtze river at the jplyr fig 1 due to its connectivity and seasonal variation of precipitation resulting from the east asian monsoon climate the water level fluctuates and lake area vary dramatically throughout the year hu et al 2007 zonal distribution of vegetation communities along elevation exists in the poyang lake wetlands during the low flow period with the optimum elevation as follows artemisia cynodon community 14 3 m phragmites triarrhena community 13 2 m carex phalaris community 12 5 m tan et al 2016 an extensive wetland has developed due to the dramatic water level fluctuations and maintains high plant richness and diversity wang et al 2016 poyang lake provides significant environmental benefits such as supplying water maintaining biodiversity and providing habitats for migratory birds du et al 2017 the jplyr consists of the guanzhou meijiazhou and xinzhou wetlands and is located at the northern region of poyang lake between latitudes 28 41 6 and 29 47 34 80 and longitudes 116 6 43 19 and 116 15 14 38 e fig 1c guanzhou meijiazhou and xinzhou wetlands experience significant seasonal water level fluctuations of more than 10 m which exposes mudflats and vegetation during the dry season october to may of the following year and submerges the area during the flood season june to september consistent with poyang lake wetlands the artemisia cynodon community phragmites triarrhena community and carex phalaris community are distributed across the wetlands of jplyr along elevation from high to low these plants germinate to form wetland plants during the dry season but die when submerged during the flood season overall the poyang lake wetlands and jplyr have similar vegetation communities and dynamics 2 2 tgd operation and study period division the tgd was proposed as early as 1919 but was not constructed until 1993 the tgd was completed and began operation in may 2003 and water ahead of the dam was raised from 67 m to 135 m the highest water level in the dam reservoir remained unchanged at a level of 135 m from 2003 to 2005 during the second phase of the pilot operation of the tgd 2006 2008 the water level was raised from 135 m to 156 m in the third pilot phase 2008 2009 the water level reached 172 m since 2010 the tgd has been in regular operation and the highest water level has reached 175 m the tgd stores and flushes water seasonally and regularly and follows a scheme of storing water during the dry season and releasing water during the wet season the increasing water levels decrease the outflow of the dam to lower reaches of the river during the dry season and decreasing the water levels during the wet season requires a more massive outflow to the lower reaches lyu et al 2018 since regular operation of the tgd in 2010 the water level in the dam reservoir has been maintained at a low level 145 m between june and september wet season for flood control and at the end of september the tgd reduces outflow to raise the water level in the reservoir for power generation the water level dose not reach 175 m until november and is maintained at 175 m from november to january in the next year since january in order to maintain standard power generation during the low flow period the tgd increases outflow thus continuously decreases the water level in the reservoir until 145 m is reached until june when the wet season begins guo et al 2018 the operation of tgd ensures flood prevention during the wet season and maintains adequate water levels during the dry season for consistent power generation in the region in order to better understand the influence of tgd on jplyr a period of 32 years 1987 through 2018 was divided according to the construction and operation of tgd the year of 1987 1993 is defined as the preparatory construction stage pcs because the actual construction of tgd started in 1993 the project was completed in 2002 so the year of 1994 2002 is defined as the construction stage cs tgd started operation in 2003 and the highest water level in the reservoir gradually increased between 2003 and 2009 so years from 2003 to 2009 are defined as the early impoundment stage eis since 2010 tgd has been in regular operation and the highest water level reached 175 m for the first time and has remained unchanged the period from 2010 to 2018 is known as the impoundment stage is guo et al 2018 table 1 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 vegetation data extraction from landsat imagery multispectral images of the study area were acquired from landsat 5 tm n 23 and landsat 8 operational land imager n 6 path number 120 121 row number 39 40 for the period of the dry season a total of 29 landsat images taken during november and december from 1987 to 2018 were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs https glovis usgs gov app these years 1997 2011 2012 when hydrological variables without vegetation being present were also excluded the 29 high quality landsat images were pre processed using envi v 5 3 exelis vis boulder co usa including geographic correction radiometric correction flaash fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes atmosphere correction and image subset mosaicking all images had the same universal transverse mercator utm coordinates based on the world geodetic system 1984 wgs 84 knorn et al 2009 wetlands in the jplyr area were classified into four areas water vegetation mudflat and unclassified unclassified areas were mainly those disturbed by human activities random forest rf classification breiman 2001 a machine learning ensemble algorithm based on decision tree classifiers was used to classify the landsat images the details of rf can be found elsewhere cutler et al 2004 na et al 2010 default parameter setting number of trees 500 node number q where q equals the number of predictor variables within a dataset was optimal according to the out of bag oob chart the rf model was implemented using the package randomforestclassification in envi v5 3 the classification maps were validated using 556 ground truth points from a field survey conducted in december 2018 a standard error matrix overall classification accuracies and kappa chance correction statistics were used to determine map accuracy congalton and green 1998 the overall accuracy for the classification conducted on the landsat imagery from 2018 reached 99 82 table 2 therefore meeting the requirements for inclusion in this research changes in the jplyr land cover types before and after the impoundment of the tgd were analyzed using a wetland transition map the superimposed images were taken in the beginning of the cs 1994 and the final observation year 2018 respectively and the difference between the water levels of the two images was less than 0 3 m the areas of each land cover type were calculated for each landsat classification image to quantify the changes of the jplyr wetlands over the last three decades spatial analysis and raster calculations were completed in arcgis v 10 2 2 3 2 hydrological analysis daily water level data collected at the hukou gauge station located at jplyr between 1987 and 2018 were used to represent the poyang lake estuary water levels in this study daily hydrological data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province and the changjiang water resources commission hydrological data were continuous with no missing values but vegetation data were discontinuous with values in 1997 2011 and 2012 missing thus in this study hydrological data in 1997 2011 and 2012 were excluded for the consistency with the vegetation data hydrological variables regarding magnitude duration timing and variation were selected for this study according to the definition of water regime casanova and brock 2000 dai et al 2016 the current study focuses on the distribution of wetland plants which typically have annual cycles due to dramatic and regular seasonal water level fluctuations dai et al 2016 hence the time scale of the water level fluctuation in this study was limited to an ecological range from daily to annual measurements the highest annual water level hawl average annual water level aawl and the lowest annual water level lawl which indicate the extreme and average hydrological conditions of the year may relate to the tolerance limit and optimal range of water level fluctuation for vegetation you et al 2015 in addition vegetation distribution may be affected by water level fluctuations for the preceding periods dai et al 2016 thus the antecedent water level index awi which refers to the hydrological condition in a period of time before remote sensing image shooting was applied as the hydrological variables furthermore factors indicating droughts and floods such as beginning of the dry flood season bds bfs and duration of the dry flood season dds fd 17 m and fd 19 m were also found crucial in affecting vegetation distribution in poyang lake han et al 2018 in order to analyze the possible alteration of various water level fluctuation patterns a total of 16 variables indicating magnitude duration of flood dry season arrival time of flood dry season and variation were selected in this study table 3 trends in the 16 hydrological variables over last three decades were determined using the mann kendall mk trend test which is a non parametric test that is widely used in hydro ecology to investigate the time trends of variables hamed and rao 1998 when using the mk trend test hamed and rao 1998 suggested a null hypothesis that there is no trend at the 95 confidence level if mk 0 the trend is considered to be decreasing and if mk 0 it is considered to be increasing the mean range and standard deviation sd of hydrological variables and vegetation area during the four stages e g pcs cs eis and is were calculated differences in all variables between the four stages of the tgd were determined by one way anova differences between means were tested by tukey s test with post hoc multiple comparisons the linear relationships between the area of vegetation and hydrological variables were analyzed by simple linear regression with a one tailed significance test to determine the significance level of the fitting results beta is the slope of linear relationships between hydrological variables and vegetation values of the coefficient of determination r2 adj ranged from 0 to 1 which indicate the strength of the linear relationship between the variables with large values indicating stronger relationships the above analyses including the mk trend test one way anova tukey s test and simple linear regression were conducted using spss 13 0 statistical software only p values less than 0 05 were considered statistically significant 2 3 3 pca analysis hydrological variables and vegetation data were sorted using principal component analysis pca with varimax rotation factor loadings represent the nature of variation any factor with an eigenvalue greater than unity was selected as significant hydrological variables and vegetation data were tested for pca constraints 2 3 4 classification and regression tree cart classification and regression tree cart was used to determine the multivariate non linear relations between hydrological variables and vegetation coverage cart is a non parametric data mining technique that can reflect non linear and non additive relationships between the response variables and predictor variables it uses recursive partitioning to separate the data into subset so that the records with each subset are more homogeneous than in the previous one the final result resembles an inverted tree structure as a sequence of simple yes no questions however as with stepwise linear regression procedures adding variables will continuously increase the fit of the model to the data but at the cost of increasing the true fit to an independent dataset therefore an optimal tree is the smallest tree whose misclassification risk is not much higher than that of the largest tree the minimal cost complexity pruning method was used in this study to measure and reduce the complexity and misclassification risk and retain only a simple and robust tree details of cart are published elsewhere faller and mccleery 2017 speybroeck 2012 cart can indicate the importance of predictor variables and associated threshold for the prediction of the response variable and can help gain insight into the splitting process 3 results 3 1 water level fluctuation at the hukou station according to fig 2 and the mk analysis varying degrees of changes in the magnitude of water level fluctuations in the jplyr were found significant decreases occurred in awi day 25 p 0 05 mk 1 96 and awi day 30 p 0 03 mk 02 12 smaller changes p 0 05 were found in hawl lawl aawl awi day 5 awi day 10 awi day 15 and awi day 20 with the mk values of 1 44 0 75 1 86 1 59 1 71 1 67 1 75 respectively this suggests that all hydrological variables except for lawl have suffered a decline over the past three decades as for duration a significant increase was found in dds p 0 00 mk 2 95 and no significant decreases p 0 05 were found in fd 17 m and fd 19 m with mk values of 1 62 and 1 42 respectively as for beginning of dry season flood season a significant decrease was found in bds p 0 00 mk 3 25 while no significant increase was found in bfs p 0 40 mk 0 85 no significant changes were found in rov p 0 12 mk 1 58 and cov p 0 30 mk 1 03 either overall the region is experiencing increases in aridity in the jplyr 3 2 land cover changes in the jplyr land cover types in the jplyr include water mudflats vegetation and unclassified fig 3 the vegetation area increased significantly p 0 05 from 1987 to 2018 and the coverage area increased by 2 328 km2 from 1987 0 677 km2 to 2018 3 005 km2 fig 4 a the ratio of vegetation area to the total area of vegetation and mudflats is shown in fig 4b the mudflat has transitioned into vegetation and vice versa during the dry seasons from 1987 to 2018 however both the mudflat and vegetation disappeared during the floods the vegetation ratio increased from 1987 to 2018 with the value peaking at 0 76 in 2015 the second highest vegetation ratio 0 72 was observed in 2000 while the lowest 0 09 was observed in 1990 according to the transition map fig 5 the most dramatic change occurred in the guanzhou wetland where 43 of the mudflats 1 012 km2 and 2 of the water 0 127 km2 transitioned into vegetation over all there has been a 611 increase in vegetation in the guanzhou wetland from 1994 0 186 km2 to 2018 1 325 km2 the transformation of vegetation to water or mudflat did not occur 21 of mudflat 0 383 km2 and 1 of water 0 053 km2 transformed into vegetation in the meijiazhou wetland few areas of vegetation 0 002 km2 transformed into water or mudflat over all vegetation in meijiazhou increased by 121 from 1994 0 359 km2 to 2018 0 793 km2 the transformation in the xinzhou wetland was not remarkable because the wetland is very small 3 534 km2 compared to the guanzhou 9 464 km2 and meijiazhou 9 424 km2 wetlands in the xinzhou wetland only 8 0 041 km2 of the mudflat and 2 0 051 km2 of the water transitioned into vegetation moreover 73 0 171 km2 of the vegetation transitioned into water and mudflat overall 1 667 km2 of the mudflat and water transformed into vegetation but only an area of 0 173 km2 of vegetation transformed into water or mudflat across the three wetlands the most remarkable increase in vegetation was observed in the guanzhou wetland 3 3 relationships between hydrological variables and landcover linear relationships between hydrological variables and vegetation areas were explored using simple linear regression table 4 significant relationships p 0 05 were found between the vegetation area va and most hydrological variables indicating magnitude it is worth noting that very weak linear relationships were found between lawl and va p 0 248 r2 adj 0 014 as for the duration of floods or droughts dds closely correlated to va p 0 007 r2 adj 0 208 while fd 17 m and fd 19 m weakly related with va p 0 05 the most significant relationships corresponding to the timing of water level changes were found between bds and va p 0 001 r2 adj 0 328 while no significant correlations were found between bfs and va p 0 664 r2 adj 0 03 as for variation of water level fluctuations significant correlations were found between rov and va p 0 027 r2 adj 0 138 while no significant correlations were found between cov and va p 0 300 r2 adj 0 004 all hydrological variables indicating low flow events except for lawl were found to be significantly correlated to va p 0 05 pca sorted the variables of va and the 16 hydrological variables based on the dataset of the last three decades table 5 lists the significant factors eigenvalue 1 and the pca loading matrix fig 6 shows the plot of the loadings of the first two factors the three significant factors accounted for 82 97 of the total variation with eigenvalues of 2 77 for factor 1 2 17 for factor 2 and 1 29 for factor 3 the first factor accounted for 45 15 of the total variation which positively related to hawl aawl awi day 5 10 15 20 25 30 fd 17 m and bds however it negatively related to dds and va factor 2 accounted for 27 92 of the total variance which positively related to awi day 5 10 15 20 25 30 dds and bfs but negatively related to hawl aawl fd 17 m fd 19 m and rov factor 3 accounted for 9 90 of the total variance which positively related to lawl and va but negatively related to bfs and bds table 5 the input of the cart model included va and 16 predictor variables a simple and robust tree was obtained when cost complexity cp was set to 0 1 bds lawl and awi day 15 finally entered into the cart model and among these hydrological variables bds had the most significant impact on the variation of va fig 7 shows the results from the application of the cart model the 293 day threshold was acquired from the results of cart model when bds was later than the 293rd day of the year changes in the distribution of vegetation were mainly dependent on awi day 15 when the average water level for the preceding 15 days was higher than 9 4 m vegetation would experience a dramatic decline by approximately 0 996 km2 otherwise when water levels were less than 9 4 m the average va would encompass an area greater than 2 206 km2 when bds came earlier than the 293rd day of the year changes in vegetation were mainly determined by lawl when lawl was less than 7 2 m a relatively low va area about 1 396 km2 was observed when lawl was greater than 7 2 m va would experience an evident increase by approximately 2 764 km2 3 4 the influence of the tgd on hydrological variables and vegetation the differences between the 16 hydrological variables and va across the four tgd stages were calculated to determine the potential influence of the tgd on wetland vegetation fig 8 overall the magnitude of water level has decreased over the past three decades significant changes p 0 05 were found in hawl and aawl which decreased by 2 4 m and 1 3 m respectively during eis compared to that during cs moreover awi day 10 15 20 25 30 during is was significantly lower p 0 05 than during pcs however lawl and awi day 5 remained unchanged throughout the past four stages significant changes in the duration of water level fluctuation p 0 05 were observed between cs and eis an average value of fd 17 m and fd 19 m decreased by 44 days and 33 days in eis compared with cs and dds increased by 44 days there were also significant changes in the timing of water level fluctuations bfs during eis came approximately 26 days later than during pcs p 0 05 and bds during eis came approximately 25 days earlier than during cs p 0 05 a significant decrease in the variation of water level fluctuations p 0 05 of rov was observed between cs and eis with a value of 2 1 m no significant changes were found in cov between the four stages significant increases p 0 05 of va were found between all four stages with increases of 0 310 km2 0 750 km2 and 1 445 km2 respectively from pcs to is remarkable drought trends and apparent increases in the vegetation area were found in the region especially after the impoundment of tgd relationships between the hydrological variables and vegetation coverage among the four tgd stages were analyzed using simple linear regression table 6 as for relationships between va and the magnitude of the water level fluctuations r2 adj of linear regressions between va and awi day 5 10 15 20 25 30 in pcs were 0 3 but subsequently dropped below 0 2 during cs eis and is hawl aawl and lawl had limited influence p 0 05 on the va among the four stages overall flood events e g fd 17 m and fd 19 m did not significantly influence the vegetation distribution pattern p 0 05 relationship p 0 05 between dds and va was only significant during cs overall bds was significant p 0 05 in affecting va during all four stages while bfs was not significant p 0 05 during any stage rov and cov which indicate variations in water level fluctuations had weak relationships with va p 0 05 during all four stages of tgd in summary relationships between the hydrological variables and va varied between stages of tgd but bds was always the most significant hydrological variable in affecting va throughout all four stages 4 discussion 4 1 land cover changes in the jplyr related to hydrological variables there has been a dramatic increase in vegetation coverage in the jplyr over the last thirty years p 0 00 mk 6 08 the vegetation area in 1987 was only 0 677 km2 and increased by 344 in 2018 to 3 005 km2 although increases were also found in other areas of poyang lake the rates of increase were much slower you et al 2015 found a 58 increase in vegetation area in the delta wetland of poyang lake near the gan river during the dry season from 1996 to 2009 a 186 increase in vegetation area was observed in the national nature reserve of poyang lake from 2000 to 2014 han et al 2018 several studies have shown that the increase rate in vegetation area in poyang lake has been slowed down since around 2010 han et al 2018 ye et al 2019 compared with poyang lake the growth rate of vegetation in the jplyr was much faster relationships between vegetation and hydrological variables in poyang lake have been discussed for many years you et al 2015 tan et al 2016 however in the jplyr this issue is now discussed for the first time linear and non linear relationships between the 16 hydrological variables and va were analyzed based on simple linear regression pca and cart model and bds was determined to be the most significant factor in our study water levels at jplyr reach their peak during summer and reach their minimum during autumn and winter to cope with the fluctuation in the water level vegetation communities in jplyr have formed their own adaptive characteristics and strategies cui et al 2000 plants in jplyr germinate in spring but then are destroyed by floods in summer and can not restore until the floods recede in the autumn usually at the end of october when the daily average temperature is about 20 and yet the daylight is still up to 10 h per day guan et al 1987 therefore inundations become the only limiting factor to control the vegetation growth operation of the tgd causes an earlier arrival of bds allowing for the wetlands to be exposed in advance which provides an aerobic environment for the soil seed bank in the lower beaches to germinate adequate water light and heat in jplyr provide the wetlands a suitable environment for vegetation to grow ye et al 2019 in addition although the spatial extension of agriculture activities has not expanded the increasing use of fertilizers in recent decades may have increased fertilizer leakage and promote the increase in vegetation coverage these above mentioned reasons may explain the dramatic increase of vegetation in jplyr over the last three decades it is worth noting that lawl is not significant p 0 248 in simple regression model but is rather important in cart according to fig 7 the influence of lawl on va was driven by bds specifically when bds was earlier than 293rd day of the year and lawl was less than 7 2 m vegetation in jplyr would be stressed and va would have a coverage area of only 1 396 km2 however if lawl was greater than 7 2 m with the bds still occurred before the 293rd day of the year the habitat conditions would be most suitable for vegetation and the average va would cover an area of approximately 2 764 km2 this suggests that the influence of lawl on va is non linear and indirect the above results differ from those of you et al 2015 on poyang lake which indicated that lawl was significantly negatively correlated to va compared with poyang lake the processes of rising and falling water in the jplyr are faster due to the open terrain and steeper slopes in addition sediment particles are larger because of the faster water velocity of the yangtze river wang et al 2018 thus the loss of soil water is also faster after the wetlands are exposed therefore vegetation in the jplyr might be more vulnerable to extreme drought nevertheless lawl does not stress vegetation when it does not exceed a certain threshold 7 2 m as indicated in fig 7 4 2 influence of the tgd on the jilyr since the construction of the tgd many scientific research programs have been set up to predict and examine the potential impacts of the dam on upstream and downstream ecosystems the dam has resulted in significant changes to the river system including poyang lake zhang et al 2012b guo et al 2018 the impoundment of the tgd decreases the discharge and lowers the water level of the yangtze river and the hydraulic gradient has passively increased in the jplyr thus accelerated the drainage of poyang lake zhang et al 2012b cheng et al 2018 it is worth noting that the influence of the tgd on poyang lake decreases from north to south across the lake lai et al 2013 jplyr is located in the northern most section of poyang lake and is the area most affected by tgd by considering that ecological systems within the jplyr are similar to those existing at poyang lake we believe that the vegetation changes related to the water level fluctuations in the jplyr may provide predication and guidance on the potential impact of the tgd on poyang lake in jplyr most hydrological variables e g hawl aawl duration of floods and drought bds and rov significantly changed after eis p 0 05 the reduction of the flood frequency and decline of the peak lake water are due to the flood control of tgd from june to september wet season water levels ahead of the tgd are maintained at a low water level throughout the wet season sustaining a flood control volume available for river floods forming in the upper reaches zheng 2016 the presence of the dam has significantly reduced the water flowing from the yangtze river to poyang lake during this intense flooding period zheng 2016 therefore hawl fd 17 m and fd 19 m significantly decreased after eis after the end of september the tgd reduces the outflow and stores water for power generation until the water level reaches175 m guo et al 2018 this operation typically occurs one month ahead of the dry season of poyang lake water level downstream is then reduced and wetlands in the jplyr are exposed prematurely this may explain the significant p 0 05 earlier arrival of bds after eis furthermore lawl decreased at poyang lake lai et al 2014c but remained unchanged in the jplyr in our study which may indicate more substantial influence of the tgd on jplyr lawl appears during january and february when the tgd increases outflow to maintain power generation thus slightly increasing the lowest water level downstream lai et al 2013 the increasing effect of the tgd on lawl plus the drought trend allows for the water level to remain almost unchanged over the last thirty years therefore the decrease in rov is mainly caused by the reduction of the annual peak water level the responses of the jplyr to the tgd are very complex and vary over time and are in combination climate influences thus long term and periodic monitoring is necessary to understand the impacts of the tgd on downstream rivers and lakes relationships between hydrological variables and vegetation vary across the four stages of the tgd for example the average level for the preceding periods e g awi 5 10 15 20 25 30 days were found to closely correlate to va only during pcs dds was significantly p 0 05 related to va only during cs it is worth noting that the relationship between va and bds is significant based on different statistical methods and always significant in all substages of the tgd as previously mentioned bds is the most important hydrological variable affecting vegetation distribution in the jplyr because the dry season occurs earlier every year wetlands are exposed ahead of time which can provide a more suitable environment for vegetation in the lower beaches it appears that the operation of the tgd resembles the natural law of submergence and exposure of wetlands and the earlier exposed wetlands accelerate the expansion of vegetation in the region in this study the trend of change in hawl was not significant over the last three decades based on mk but a significant decrease in the hawl was found between cs and eis using one way anova lawl was not significant at all for affecting va according to simple linear regression but it was relatively important according to cart this might explain the different conclusions in previous studies regarding the hydro ecological process of poyang lake you et al 2015 dai et al 2016 even so significant changes in the bds and its significant influence on vegetation were found on different temporal scales using different statistical methods this correlation indicates the enormous impact of an earlier arrival of bds on vegetation which is caused by the impoundment of the tgd thus an appropriate periodic division according to milestones of important events is crucial in determining the mechanisms affecting these actions furthermore it is advisable to find the strongest influencing factors by comparing the results of different statistical methods xie et al 2019 5 conclusion we found that the vegetation coverage increased over the last three decades in the jplyr a decreased magnitude of water level fluctuations extended dry season shorter flood season earlier arrival of the dry season and later arrival of the flood season were observed after the impoundment of the tgd while the lawl remained almost unchanged low flow events were more important compared to high flow events in affecting vegetation in jplyr the bds was the most significant hydrological variable affecting the vegetation area we suggest that drought in the jplyr is conducive to vegetation expansion and that an earlier arrival of bds caused by the tgd is the leading cause for the increased vegetation the jplyr is of vital importance as an ecological indicator for poyang lake and the yangtze river system knowledge of changes in the landcover across the jplyr and their leading causes provide valuable guidance for improving the ecological service and comprehensive management of poyang lake the influence of an earlier arrival of the dry season in the jplyr is worth noting because the public perception is that shallow water levels contribute to increased vegetation in poyang lake more research is required on river lake junctions to provide a scientific basis to support sustainable management of river lake ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement lilin zheng
