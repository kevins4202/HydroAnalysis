publicly available datasets were analyzed in this study which can be found at https nucleus iaea org wiser index aspx the supplementary material 2 of tyler et al 2016 and in the papers cited see sect 2 1 for further details 1 introduction the ratio of heavy and light stable isotopes of the water molecule 18o 16o 2h 1h is a frequently used tool in environmental isotope geochemistry specifically in hydrology climatology and biogeochemistry coplen et al 2000 stable isotope composition is conventionally expressed as δ values in per mill coplen 1994 the isotopic composition of precipitation δ p provides an insight into the origin of water vapor and the conditions attained during condensation and precipitation dansgaard 1964 using these variations stable isotopes in meteoric water have become important natural tracers in the study of the water cycle bowen and good 2015 fórizs 2003 with the continuous advancement in effectiveness and availability of analytical tools the spatiotemporal abundance of precipitation stable isotope measurements is steadily increasing yoshimura 2015 providing sufficient ground for the development of spatially continuous datasets of isotope composition these datasets can be utilized for advanced hydrological applications of precipitation stable isotopes where excess information can be gained from not only having point data but spatially continuous information such applications can be found in hydrogeology bowen and good 2015 clark and fritz 1997 limnology birkel et al 2018 nan et al 2019 tyler et al 2022 water resource management bowen and good

independent geographical parameters and ii kriging of the residuals bowen and revenaugh 2003 bowen and wilkinson 2002 two decades ago this particular approach was tested against potential alternatives to interpolate δ p variability and has been proven to provide better estimates bowen and revenaugh 2003 this method has been widely applied and became the gold standard in mapping the spatial distribution of δ p globally e g bowen 2010 terzer et al 2013 van der veer et al 2009 and regionally e g chan et al 2012 hatvani et al 2020 hatvani et al 2017 kaseke et al 2016 kern et al 2014 lykoudis and argiriou 2007 machine learning approaches random forests and similar techniques are increasingly used to extract patterns and insights from the ever increasing stream of geospatial data reichstein et al 2019 becoming a frequently used tool in geosciences for interpolating environmental variables hengl et al 2018 examples of the application of machine learning methods in deriving isoscapes are scarce and are related to e g bioavailable strontium bataille et al 2020 funck et al 2021 on sulfur isotopes in human remains bataille et al 2021 nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes in particulate matter from the northwest atlantic continental shelf oczkowski et al 2016 and continental studies on the isotopic composition of shallow groundwater stahl et al 2020 an especially relevant work related to the present study is the precipitation isoscape derived by gradient boosting nelson et al 2021 there have been comparative studies on the performance of different interpolation techniques in relation to mapping geochemical and meteorological data including stable isotope values in these comparisons regression kriging rk has performed better than basic interpolation techniques such as triangulation or inverse distance weighting bowen and revenaugh 2003 li et al 2011 moreover machine learning algorithms seemed to perform similarly hengl et al 2018 or even better than combined geostatistical tools bataille et al 2018 li et al 2011 zandi et al 2022 nevertheless random forest interpolation has not yet been applied to map the spatial structure of precipitation stable isotopes with the vast number of possible methods to apply when interpolating environmental variables benchmarks are needed to be able to decide which particular approach suits best the data at hand thus the present study aims to compare the performance of combined geostatistical tools i e regression kriging and various machine learning ml methods including the novel regression enhanced random forest methods in interpolating the spatial variability of precipitation oxygen stable isotopes δ 18o from two different sampling networks in europe 2 materials and methods 2 1 used data and preprocessing in the course of the research the efficiency of interpolation methods were tested on two datasets chosen to provide sufficient data for interpolation and to enable independent validation of results daily precipitation stable isotope observations from the united kingdom dataset1 and monthly data from germany and its surroundings dataset2 were used the daily precipitation stable isotopic data dataset 1 was acquired from three consecutive days between 23 and 25 january 2012 by tyler et al 2016 conducted in the frame of the british isotopes in rainfall project birp birp included 67 68 and 67 stations providing data parallel for 23rd 24th and 25th of january respectively which is an exceptionally high spatial coverage although for just a short amount of time out of the three days 23 january was the most variable and 25 the least fig s1 in the case of dataset2 a subdomain of central europe was selected covering various physiographic conditions the backbone of datatset2 is the german sampling network of stable water isotopes in precipitation stumpp et al 2014 which had the highest number of active stations n 30 in 1998 hence monthly data from this year was chosen for the methodological comparison of the present study this dataset was extended with additional monitoring stations from the neighboring countries within a 10 km band in order to stretch out the interpolated maps across the entirety of germany fig 1 a the only exception was groeningen nl 30 km from the german border in the nw altogether 10 stations from the austrian national network umweltbundesamt 2019 and two stations from the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip iaea 2019 were included to improve the spatial coverage for dataset2 representing the central european domain fig 1 out of the four months the values of january representing winter were the most variable and july representing summer the least median values were highest in the summer fig s1 to account for seasonal hydrometeorological differences and keep the number of cases assessed from dataset1 and 2 comparable not all of the twelve months but the central month of every season january april july october was considered from dataset2 alongside the three days of dataset1 in dataset1 the distances between the stations are mostly 50 spread between 160 and 430 km median 339 km while in dataset2 the range is considerably wider 60 of the distances between 230 and 600 km median 383 km reinforcing the visual impression fig 1 a that dataset1 is much more densely populated fig 1 b than dataset2 fig 1 c nevertheless clustering can be observed in both cases to a different extent in dataset 1 the eastern and north eastern parts were scarcely covered with no data on the coastlines while the southern parts of england and wales were most densely sampled in dataset 2 the high spatial abundance of stations in the south primarily due to the inclusion of stations from the austrian national network data is noteworthy fig 1 the first step in data preprocessing was to numerically check the δ values for potential database errors e g typos sign errors iaea 1992 this was done by local indicator of spatial association lisa which is used to identify outliers as in anselin s moran scatterplot anselin 1995 and supplement sect 1 it highlighted if nearby values were exceptionally dissimilar although it is expected that the closer the sites are the more the values measured at them resemble each other tobler 1970 a second order stable isotope variable is d excess defined as d δ 2h 8 δ 18o dansgaard 1964 in the present case it is used for detecting outlying values in the dataset if a monthly δ 18o value appeared to be an outlier according to the lisa statistics the corresponding d excess value was explored as well similarly to hatvani et al 2023 for example very negative d excess values occasionally even lower than 10 were interpreted as an indication of evaporative enrichment of the sample bowen et al 2018 and it was discarded from the evaluation if no neighboring stations reported similarly extreme d excess values for the given month with this procedure the january value at goerlitz fig s2 a and the april value at berlin fig s2 b were discarded leaving january and april with 40 and july october with 41 data points in the dataset2 while dataset1 remained unchanged 2 2 methods applied after data preprocessing the efficiency of a classical geostatistical method and three additional machine learning tools were explored in interpolating and replicating precipitation stable isotope variability multiple regression kriging rk hengl et al 2007 is one of the most basic and widely used geostatistical interpolation techniques relying on both spatial autocorrelation and covariate information sekulić et al 2020 for details see sect 2 2 1 secondly a machine learning method random forest breiman 2001 in regression exercises was applied which was chosen for its previous application for interpolating isotope data e g bataille et al 2018 and other environmental variables hengl et al 2018 lastly machine learning methods combined with regression analysis i multiple regression random forest mrrf sect 2 2 2 sekulić et al 2020 and ii regression enhanced random forest rerf sect 2 2 2 zhang et al 2019 were used for a summary see table s1 the investigations were conducted uniformly in web mercator projection epsg 3857 since variography should be performed on a metric scale hatvani et al 2021 2 2 1 regression kriging over large scale distances trend like predisposition of stable isotopes in precipitation were documented dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 which could mask the local spatial autocorrelation patterns regression kriging rk is specifically a tool which accounts for these trend like processes in its multiple regression component with geographic and climatic variables as the independent predictors and the primary precipitation stable oxygen isotope values as the dependent variables the spatial variability determined by multiple regression used to define an initial grid second a residual grid is created using universal kriging cressie 1990 hengl et al 2007 and its weight function theoretical semivariograms matheron 1965 fitted on to the residuals of the multivariate regression model finally the initial and residual grids are summarized to obtain the final predicted δ 18 o in rk the employed multiple regression and geographic variables used to explain stable isotope variance in the regions were latitude longitude in

provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric land and oceanic climate variables at a 30 km spatial resolution daily and monthly aggregates of the hourly fields are available as well in the study the meteorological variables were extracted from the daily aggregates for dataset 1 and monthly aggregates for dataset 2 geodetic distance from the coast calculated in r using the spatial coordinates with the gdistance function of the rgeos package version 0 5 9 bivand and rundel 2021 being the dominant wind direction and moisture source pathway tyler et al 2016 it could have been a viable approach to consider the distance from the atlantic ocean in the case of dataset1 however this would have violated the general applicability of the present exercise and comparability of the results from datasets 1 and 2 the multiple regression model was constructed by backward elimination in a stepwise process o brien 2007 of the possible predictors considering significance adj r2 and the variance inflation factor vif applied in numerous similar studies e g hatvani et al 2020 hatvani et al 2017 in this study only the δ 18 o values at the validation stations locations are used and not the whole grid the semivariograms were fitted to the data with least squares fitting in all cases resulting in the fit of a spherical model fig s3 out of the possible predictors in dataset1 latitude longitude and minimum temperature were found to be applicable in dataset2 altitude was also a significant predictor in certain months however it was discarded considering i its strong covariance with temperature and ii a uniform set of environmental variables for both datasets when constructing a multiple regression model assuming that the environmental variables driving precipitation stable isotope composition should be the same in neighboring regions yet their relative importance may vary over time seasonally in july an alternative version of regression model was derived since in this particular case precipitation was also found to be a meaningful predictor in minimizing the effect of geographical factors influencing the raw δ p records all obtained models were significant p 0 093 and vif was negligible vif 4 935 while the average adj r2 varied between 0 3 and 0 5 peaking at 0 37 in the case of dataset1 fig s4 a and between 0 1 and 0 8 in a quite equally distributed way in the case of dataset2 fig s4 b 2 2 2 random forest random forest rf is a nonparametric method well known for solving prediction problems its predictions in regression problems are based on the average results of the random decision trees which use bootstrap sampling bagging to eliminate the possibility of over fitting biau and scornet 2016 breiman 2001 prasad et al 2006 in rf each tree is built using a subset of the original data set which is used to derive the tree partition and to make the tree prediction biau and scornet 2016 once the observations are selected a recursive partitioning is performed of the covariates space in each cell a number mtry of variables are selected uniformly at random among all covariates fig s5 scornet 2017 then the procedure selects the split minimizing the quadratic risk of the tree estimate at each step using the out of bag observations to evaluate the trained algorithm breiman 1996 prasad et al 2006 being repeated until each cell contains less than a prespecified number nodesize of observations after tree partition has been completed the prediction at a new point is computed by averaging observations falling into the cell of the new point then each one of the trees in the forest gives a prediction and the forest prediction is simply the average of the predicted values therefore the key tuning parameters of the rf algorithm are mtry and node size biau and scornet 2016 breiman 2001 scornet 2017 the specific parametrization of the random forest methods used here are shown in fig s6 a weakness of the algorithm is that the prediction is in the form of a weighted average of responses in the training set and the results can only be obtained within the range of the response variable resulting in prediction bias zhang and lu 2012 specifically the bias can be quite large in the extrapolation problems we typically encounter in spatial analysis to get around the problem of extrapolation rf is combined with regression analysis zhang et al 2019 in the present study lasso regression combined with rf called regression enhanced random forest rerf zhang et al 2019 and common multivariate regression combined with rf called multiple regression random forest mrrf are employed rerf is a semiparametric prediction approach predictions of the rerf are derived from the sum of the lasso regression and the rf prediction for the lasso regression residual lasso regression employs a coefficient estimate derived from a penalized least squares estimator as opposed to the linear regression model s standard least squares estimator for a given tuning parameter the l1 penalization of lasso regression enables variable selection for a large number of covariates tibshirani 1997 excluding those predictors that resulted in a coefficient equal to zero fig s6 lasso regression right column thereby improving prediction or one can provide the set of predictors the lasso regression can rank however lasso regression assumes the linear regression model which has a potentially limited structure limiting its prediction ability to data with a complex structure in other words bias can be anticipated when applying only lasso regression therefore in the rerf approach the random forest method is applied to the residual of the lasso regression to correct the possible bias zhang et al 2019 each method of lasso regression and rf method has distinct tuning parameters which certainly affect both lasso regression and rf performance therefore selecting a tuning parameter combination that reduces the overall prediction error would be reasonable in this instance a tuning parameter was chosen using cross validation a reliable approach for estimating the prediction error zhang et al 2019 note that a grid search algorithm was applied when choosing the combination of tuning parameters using rerf higher prediction performance is expected smaller errors than with ordinary rf especially in the case where extrapolation is needed in mrrf the same multiple regression model was applied to complement the rf as with rk the predictors were manually chosen 2 3 validation statistics for validation purposes 15 of the available data were randomly retained while ensuring that these test stations are not closer to each other than 50 km to avoid clustering of the validation points this random selection was repeated ten times for each day investigated from dataset1 and each month from dataset2 to provide ensembles to better depict the performance of the compared methods in the validation process ordinary and hybrid error metrics were used to explore the performance of the different methods in replicating the actual measured δ 18o values two ordinary metrics the mean standard error mse eq 1 and the relative mean absolute error rmae were calculated out of which the former is highly suggested to be included in such studies to make it comparable to others li and heap 2008 1 mse 1 n i 1 n δ i δ i 2 where n is the number of data points δ i the value returned by the model and δi the actual value for data point i to complement this metric and make the results comparable with studies in which the primary variables are in a different measurement unit or resolution rmae was also calculated supplement sect 2 fig s7 due to its scale independency li and heap 2008 lastly the newly developed non parametric version of the kling gupta efficiency kge was used pool et al 2018 as a hybrid error metric since ordinary kge implicitly assumes data normality and the absence of outliers clark et al 2021 the kge can take values between and 1 with 1 indicating a perfect agreement between the simulations and observations and the lower the kge gets the less accurate the estimation is compared to the observations gupta et al 2009 knoben et al 2019 to test how sensitive the prediction performance under reduced data availability the training data in both datasets were randomly rarefied one by one in dataset 1 46 stations were excluded this way corresponding to 79 of the training set while in dataset 2 27 stations were left out at the end corresponding similarly to 79 of the training set the models were recalculated using the reduced training sets and the results were compared to the previously used validation stations see above due to high demand in computational resources in the case of rerf the rarefaction was carried out at a lower resolution i e pairs of stations were removed in one step for even more specifics the reader is referred to the used r code supplement section 4 2 4 software used variography was conducted using the gstat package version 2 0 9 pebesma 2004 the lasso regression was calculated using the glmnet package friedman et al 2010 and the rf mrrf rerf models are grown using 500 decision trees each and the specific parameter values for e g node size and mtry were determined by the tune function of randomforestsrc package version 3 1 1 ishwaran et al 2021 ishwaran et al 2008 in r r core team 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 importance of predictors the importance of the predictors was assessed for all models rf rk mrrf and rerf it should be noted that no uniform metric yet exists therefore the comparison is done using the relative importance of the predictors for each approach for both datasets the following metrics were applied variable importance for rf fig s6 left column adjusted r 2 for rk mrrf fig s6 middle column and normalized lasso regression coefficient using the agresti and coull 1998 method for rerf fig s6 right column the geographical position of the stations x y coordinates are generally considered to be important predictors bowen and wilkinson 2002 dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 and indeed in the case of dataset1 are among the strongest first two predictors in the case of the linear fig s6b e h and among the strongest four in the case of the non linear approaches fig s6 dataset 1 left and right columns on the contrary precipitation seems unimportant in the case of the linear models fig s6 middle column and sect 2 2 1 in the meanwhile precipitation leads the set of predictors regarding their importance in the case of rf and rerf fig s6a c on 23 jan and can also be considered meaningful on 25 january fig s6g i suggesting a non linear relationship with δ 18o in precipitation tmin was the leading variable in the case of rk and mrrf fig s6b on 23 january and taken as important on 24 january fig s6e it was also among the most important predictors in the case of all approaches on 25 january fig s6g i in the case of dataset 2 we first focus on altitude which is traditionally an important predictor in the region kern et al 2014 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 it takes the leading role in the non linear methods july is a special case see sect 2 2 1 in which both the nonlinear approaches e g fig s6p s and even multiple regression fig s6r considered precipitation as an important predictor 3 2 comparison of the interpolation schemes the mse values ranged from 2 43 to 6 36 and for the kge values stood above 0 7 without any remarkable differences considering the rk rf mrrf and rerf methods in case of the daily data dataset 1 fig 2 a c in case of the dataset 2 the mse values ranged from 0 52 to 2 69 fig 2 b relatively larger errors occurred for january and october but generally smaller errors were seen compared to dataset 1 the kge values for dataset 2 fig 2 b d were usually also above 0 7 the exceptions are the traditional methods rk in july considering both variants the performance of the two ml approaches mrrf and rerf was comparable with mrrf producing somewhat smaller mse fig 2 a b and bigger nonparametric kge values fig 2 c d closer to one indicating better predictions in contrast the standard rf method produced the highest mse among all methods in dataset 1 peaking on 23 january mse 6 4 this was the date when the data range was greatest fig s1 hashimoto et al 2019 the error metrics calculated between the measured and predicted sample values are usually utilized to evaluate the performance of interpolation methods burrough et al 1998 mse employed here fundamentally provides estimates of the average error but does not provide information about the relative size of the average difference and the nature of differences willmott 1982 therefore the absolute differences between the measured and predicted values of δ 18o were calculated for each validation ensemble member sect 2 3 and compiled for the observed time points in dataset1 fig 3 a and dataset2 fig 3 b to get a detailed picture on the error distribution the distribution of the absolute differences fig 3 follows a similar pattern as the mse fig 2 a b the ml methods gave a smaller interquartile interval of absolute errors than rk in dataset2 fig 3 b in every month and two out of three days in dataset1 fig 3 a the median of absolute differences obtained with the ml methods combined with regression analysis were smaller median 1 6 for mrrf 1 9 for rerf than the ones obtained with the common rf 2 1 for rf in the case of dataset 1 especially mrrf on 23 january in dataset 1 however in the case of dataset 2 the ml methods especially rerf performed better than the geostatistical interpolation in all cases considering the median values fig 3 b the inability of rf to extrapolate is a well known problem hashimoto et al 2019 there was a significant difference in the mse values of the two datasets fig 2 a b with the range of dataset 1 being significantly greater than that of dataset 2 fig s1 in dataset2 the smaller range of errors may be due to the better spatial distribution of the station data fig 1 the advantage of rf application over rk is that it can manifest itself in quasi automated interpolation of environmental isotopic parameters especially where the point sampling is representative extrapolation minimized hengl et al 2018 in the future the precision of the ml estimations could be further increased by including the buffer distances between the grid cells and the station data as a predictor e g in hengl et al 2018 or by even adding a weight function to these predictors based on their distances sekulić et al 2020 it should be noted that one of the main advantages of ml methods over classical geostatistical ones is that these require less knowledge about the spatial autocorrelation structure of the data which is a major disadvantage at the same time hengl et al 2007 on the other hand these ml tools such as the most recent one applied in predicting water δ 18o are not able to assess the spatial autocorrelation structure of the monitoring network nelson et al 2021 where the data originates from unlike the previously mentioned geostatistical tools e g hatvani et al 2021 3 3 model sensitivity to decreased station density as a last step the decrease in prediction potential was investigated with respect to artificial rarefaction of the monitoring stations see sect 2 3 for details in the case of dataset 1 the rerf and rf methods gave the highest mse values most of the time on 23 and 25 january while on 24 january the rerf predicted the best results up to a station density reduced by 50 fig 4 the performance of mrrf on 24 and 25 january sustained its initial performance up to a substantial rarefaction of the station data ca 50 60 the mse in the case of rk method indicates a similar pattern as mrrf on 25 january however increases to a steeper extent on 23 and 24 january fig 4 a resembling the pattern of rf but with lower values for dataset 2 rk performed the worst in july whether the precipitation was included or excluded fig 4 b in all other cases it maintains good performance up to a station density reduced by 50 60 rf and mrrf performed similarly well tolerating a reduction in input data to about 50 without any drop in performance afterward the error attributed to the interpolation performance begins to increase with a much steeper gradient for rf while mrrf indicates a much more moderate increase moreover the initial good performance of mrrf is sustained in january april and october up to even 80 station density reduction fig 4 b in the case of rerf its prediction performance was sustained up to 50 and 80 of station reduction for january and october respectively regarding rk it should be noted that the underlying theoretical semivariograms did not change to a great extent depending on the degree of rarefaction fig s3 regarding their main characteristics and types cressie 1993 this highlights the robustness of the spatial autocorrelation structure against rarefaction implying that the pattern seen prevails relatively independent of the chosen subset of sites overall mrrf seems to better reproduce the spatial variability of the two datasets even under circumstances with more than 50 of the sites not providing information similar conclusions were recently drawn regarding the robustness and less sensitivity of ml models towards stations density and their less dependency on expert knowledge comparing their performances with linear models in high resolution monthly precipitation interpolation zandi et al 2022 4 conclusions and outlook in this study the performance of four interpolation approaches was compared using two datasets of precipitation δ 18o to understand how the interpolation schemes behave under various circumstances of spatial distribution organization in order to determine which interpolation approach to utilize for producing isoscapes of different scales the results indicate that machine learning algorithms are more than capable of creating continuous datasets of precipitation stable isotopes of even superior quality than the classical geostatistical tools which were formerly considered as the gold standard in this discipline in particular machine learning methods tolerated the rarefaction of the dataset to a much greater extent especially above 50 of the data removed indicating that they can be employed with the expectation of producing comparably accurate predictions if one or more stations become inoperable or in regions where monitoring stations are sparser or unevenly distributed moreover machine learning tools require less expert knowledge in handling the predictors are less sensitive to outliers and no stationarity assumption is needed to be followed nor is there a need to deal with anisotropy or fitting variograms bataille et al 2018 hengl et al 2018 as in the case of regression kriging on the other hand unlike regression kriging machine learning algorithms do not provide overall information about the spatial autocorrelation structure of precipitation δ 18o in the studied regions nor is it possible to estimate the representativity of the assessed monitoring network based on the results the application of a random forest algorithm is highly viable option for deriving isoscapes of subcontinental continental extent especially if the practical advantages of machine learning tools over their geostatistical counterparts are considered equipping these tools to take into account additional complex predictors for instance buffer distances hengl et al 2018 or weight functions derived from δ p values e g sekulić et al 2020 is expected to further improve their

distribution of δ p globally e g bowen 2010 terzer et al 2013 van der veer et al 2009 and regionally e g chan et al 2012 hatvani et al 2020 hatvani et al 2017 kaseke et al 2016 kern et al 2014 lykoudis and argiriou 2007 machine learning approaches random forests and similar techniques are increasingly used to extract patterns and insights from the ever increasing stream of geospatial data reichstein et al 2019 becoming a frequently used tool in geosciences for interpolating environmental variables hengl et al 2018 examples of the application of machine learning methods in deriving isoscapes are scarce and are related to e g bioavailable strontium bataille et al 2020 funck et al 2021 on sulfur isotopes in human remains bataille et al 2021 nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes in particulate matter from the northwest atlantic continental shelf oczkowski et al 2016 and continental studies on the isotopic composition of shallow groundwater stahl et al 2020 an especially relevant work related to the present study is the precipitation isoscape derived by gradient boosting nelson et al 2021 there have been comparative studies on the performance of different interpolation techniques in relation to mapping geochemical and meteorological data including stable isotope values in these comparisons regression kriging rk has performed better than basic interpolation techniques such as triangulation or inverse distance weighting bowen and revenaugh 2003 li et al 2011 moreover machine learning algorithms seemed to perform similarly hengl et al 2018 or even better than combined geostatistical tools bataille et al 2018 li et al 2011 zandi et al 2022 nevertheless random forest interpolation has not yet been applied to map the spatial structure of precipitation stable isotopes with the vast number of possible methods to apply when interpolating environmental variables benchmarks are needed to be able to decide which particular approach suits best the data at hand thus the present study aims to compare the performance of combined geostatistical tools i e regression kriging and various machine learning ml methods including the novel regression enhanced random forest methods in interpolating the spatial variability of precipitation oxygen stable isotopes δ 18o from two different sampling networks in europe 2 materials and methods 2 1 used data and preprocessing in the course of the research the efficiency of interpolation methods were tested on two datasets chosen to provide sufficient data for interpolation and to enable independent validation of results daily precipitation stable isotope observations from the united kingdom dataset1 and monthly data from germany and its surroundings dataset2 were used the daily precipitation stable isotopic data dataset 1 was acquired from three consecutive days between 23 and 25 january 2012 by tyler et al 2016 conducted in the frame of the british isotopes in rainfall project birp birp included 67 68 and 67 stations providing data parallel for 23rd 24th and 25th of january respectively which is an exceptionally high spatial coverage although for just a short amount of time out of the three days 23 january was the most variable and 25 the least fig s1 in the case of dataset2 a subdomain of central europe was selected covering various physiographic conditions the backbone of datatset2 is the german sampling network of stable water isotopes in precipitation stumpp et al 2014 which had the highest number of active stations n 30 in 1998 hence monthly data from this year was chosen for the methodological comparison of the present study this dataset was extended with additional monitoring stations from the neighboring countries within a 10 km band in order to stretch out the interpolated maps across the entirety of germany fig 1 a the only exception was groeningen nl 30 km from the german border in the nw altogether 10 stations from the austrian national network umweltbundesamt 2019 and two stations from the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip iaea 2019 were included to improve the spatial coverage for dataset2 representing the central european domain fig 1 out of the four months the values of january representing winter were the most variable and july representing summer the least median values were highest in the summer fig s1 to account for seasonal hydrometeorological differences and keep the number of cases assessed from dataset1 and 2 comparable not all of the twelve months but the central month of every season january april july october was considered from dataset2 alongside the three days of dataset1 in dataset1 the distances between the stations are mostly 50 spread between 160 and 430 km median 339 km while in dataset2 the range is considerably wider 60 of the distances between 230 and 600 km median 383 km reinforcing the visual impression fig 1 a that dataset1 is much more densely populated fig 1 b than dataset2 fig 1 c nevertheless clustering can be observed in both cases to a different extent in dataset 1 the eastern and north eastern parts were scarcely covered with no data on the coastlines while the southern parts of england and wales were most densely sampled in dataset 2 the high spatial abundance of stations in the south primarily due to the inclusion of stations from the austrian national network data is noteworthy fig 1 the first step in data preprocessing was to numerically check the δ values for potential database errors e g typos sign errors iaea 1992 this was done by local indicator of spatial association lisa which is used to identify outliers as in anselin s moran scatterplot anselin 1995 and supplement sect 1 it highlighted if nearby values were exceptionally dissimilar although it is expected that the closer the sites are the more the values measured at them resemble each other tobler 1970 a second order stable isotope variable is d excess defined as d δ 2h 8 δ 18o dansgaard 1964 in the present case it is used for detecting outlying values in the dataset if a monthly δ 18o value appeared to be an outlier according to the lisa statistics the corresponding d excess value was explored as well similarly to hatvani et al 2023 for example very negative d excess values occasionally even lower than 10 were interpreted as an indication of evaporative enrichment of the sample bowen et al 2018 and it was discarded from the evaluation if no neighboring stations reported similarly extreme d excess values for the given month with this procedure the january value at goerlitz fig s2 a and the april value at berlin fig s2 b were discarded leaving january and april with 40 and july october with 41 data points in the dataset2 while dataset1 remained unchanged 2 2 methods applied after data preprocessing the efficiency of a classical geostatistical method and three additional machine learning tools were explored in interpolating and replicating precipitation stable isotope variability multiple regression kriging rk hengl et al 2007 is one of the most basic and widely used geostatistical interpolation techniques relying on both spatial autocorrelation and covariate information sekulić et al 2020 for details see sect 2 2 1 secondly a machine learning method random forest breiman 2001 in regression exercises was applied which was chosen for its previous application for interpolating isotope data e g bataille et al 2018 and other environmental variables hengl et al 2018 lastly machine learning methods combined with regression analysis i multiple regression random forest mrrf sect 2 2 2 sekulić et al 2020 and ii regression enhanced random forest rerf sect 2 2 2 zhang et al 2019 were used for a summary see table s1 the investigations were conducted uniformly in web mercator projection epsg 3857 since variography should be performed on a metric scale hatvani et al 2021 2 2 1 regression kriging over large scale distances trend like predisposition of stable isotopes in precipitation were documented dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 which could mask the local spatial autocorrelation patterns regression kriging rk is specifically a tool which accounts for these trend like processes in its multiple regression component with geographic and climatic variables as the independent predictors and the primary precipitation stable oxygen isotope values as the dependent variables the spatial variability determined by multiple regression used to define an initial grid second a residual grid is created using universal kriging cressie 1990 hengl et al 2007 and its weight function theoretical semivariograms matheron 1965 fitted on to the residuals of the multivariate regression model finally the initial and residual grids are summarized to obtain the final predicted δ 18 o in rk the employed multiple regression and geographic variables used to explain stable isotope variance in the regions were latitude longitude in

provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric land and oceanic climate variables at a 30 km spatial resolution daily and monthly aggregates of the hourly fields are available as well in the study the meteorological variables were extracted from the daily aggregates for dataset 1 and monthly aggregates for dataset 2 geodetic distance from the coast calculated in r using the spatial coordinates with the gdistance function of the rgeos package version 0 5 9 bivand and rundel 2021 being the dominant wind direction and moisture source pathway tyler et al 2016 it could have been a viable approach to consider the distance from the atlantic ocean in the case of dataset1 however this would have violated the general applicability of the present exercise and comparability of the results from datasets 1 and 2 the multiple regression model was constructed by backward elimination in a stepwise process o brien 2007 of the possible predictors considering significance adj r2 and the variance inflation factor vif applied in numerous similar studies e g hatvani et al 2020 hatvani et al 2017 in this study only the δ 18 o values at the validation stations locations are used and not the whole grid the semivariograms were fitted to the data with least squares fitting in all cases resulting in the fit of a spherical model fig s3 out of the possible predictors in dataset1 latitude longitude and minimum temperature were found to be applicable in dataset2 altitude was also a significant predictor in certain months however it was discarded considering i its strong covariance with temperature and ii a uniform set of environmental variables for both datasets when constructing a multiple regression model assuming that the environmental variables driving precipitation stable isotope composition should be the same in neighboring regions yet their relative importance may vary over time seasonally in july an alternative version of regression model was derived since in this particular case precipitation was also found to be a meaningful predictor in minimizing the effect of geographical factors influencing the raw δ p records all obtained models were significant p 0 093 and vif was negligible vif 4 935 while the average adj r2 varied between 0 3 and 0 5 peaking at 0 37 in the case of dataset1 fig s4 a and between 0 1 and 0 8 in a quite equally distributed way in the case of dataset2 fig s4 b 2 2 2 random forest random forest rf is a nonparametric method well known for solving prediction problems its predictions in regression problems are based on the average results of the random decision trees which use bootstrap sampling bagging to eliminate the possibility of over fitting biau and scornet 2016 breiman 2001 prasad et al 2006 in rf each tree is built using a subset of the original data set which is used to derive the tree partition and to make the tree prediction biau and scornet 2016 once the observations are selected a recursive partitioning is performed of the covariates space in each cell a number mtry of variables are selected uniformly at random among all covariates fig s5 scornet 2017 then the procedure selects the split minimizing the quadratic risk of the tree estimate at each step using the out of bag observations to evaluate the trained algorithm breiman 1996 prasad et al 2006 being repeated until each cell contains less than a prespecified number nodesize of observations after tree partition has been completed the prediction at a new point is computed by averaging observations falling into the cell of the new point then each one of the trees in the forest gives a prediction and the forest prediction is simply the average of the predicted values therefore the key tuning parameters of the rf algorithm are mtry and node size biau and scornet 2016 breiman 2001 scornet 2017 the specific parametrization of the random forest methods used here are shown in fig s6 a weakness of the algorithm is that the prediction is in the form of a weighted average of responses in the training set and the results can only be obtained within the range of the response variable resulting in prediction bias zhang and lu 2012 specifically the bias can be quite large in the extrapolation problems we typically encounter in spatial analysis to get around the problem of extrapolation rf is combined with regression analysis zhang et al 2019 in the present study lasso regression combined with rf called regression enhanced random forest rerf zhang et al 2019 and common multivariate regression combined with rf called multiple regression random forest mrrf are employed rerf is a semiparametric prediction approach predictions of the rerf are derived from the sum of the lasso regression and the rf prediction for the lasso regression residual lasso regression employs a coefficient estimate derived from a penalized least squares estimator as opposed to the linear regression model s standard least squares estimator for a given tuning parameter the l1 penalization of lasso regression enables variable selection for a large number of covariates tibshirani 1997 excluding those predictors that resulted in a coefficient equal to zero fig s6 lasso regression right column thereby improving prediction or one can provide the set of predictors the lasso regression can rank however lasso regression assumes the linear regression model which has a potentially limited structure limiting its prediction ability to data with a complex structure in other words bias can be anticipated when applying only lasso regression therefore in the rerf approach the random forest method is applied to the residual of the lasso regression to correct the possible bias zhang et al 2019 each method of lasso regression and rf method has distinct tuning parameters which certainly affect both lasso regression and rf performance therefore selecting a tuning parameter combination that reduces the overall prediction error would be reasonable in this instance a tuning parameter was chosen using cross validation a reliable approach for estimating the prediction error zhang et al 2019 note that a grid search algorithm was applied when choosing the combination of tuning parameters using rerf higher prediction performance is expected smaller errors than with ordinary rf especially in the case where extrapolation is needed in mrrf the same multiple regression model was applied to complement the rf as with rk the predictors were manually chosen 2 3 validation statistics for validation purposes 15 of the available data were randomly retained while ensuring that these test stations are not closer to each other than 50 km to avoid clustering of the validation points this random selection was repeated ten times for each day investigated from dataset1 and each month from dataset2 to provide ensembles to better depict the performance of the compared methods in the validation process ordinary and hybrid error metrics were used to explore the performance of the different methods in replicating the actual measured δ 18o values two ordinary metrics the mean standard error mse eq 1 and the relative mean absolute error rmae were calculated out of which the former is highly suggested to be included in such studies to make it comparable to others li and heap 2008 1 mse 1 n i 1 n δ i δ i 2 where n is the number of data points δ i the value returned by the model and δi the actual value for data point i to complement this metric and make the results comparable with studies in which the primary variables are in a different measurement unit or resolution rmae was also calculated supplement sect 2 fig s7 due to its scale independency li and heap 2008 lastly the newly developed non parametric version of the kling gupta efficiency kge was used pool et al 2018 as a hybrid error metric since ordinary kge implicitly assumes data normality and the absence of outliers clark et al 2021 the kge can take values between and 1 with 1 indicating a perfect agreement between the simulations and observations and the lower the kge gets the less accurate the estimation is compared to the observations gupta et al 2009 knoben et al 2019 to test how sensitive the prediction performance under reduced data availability the training data in both datasets were randomly rarefied one by one in dataset 1 46 stations were excluded this way corresponding to 79 of the training set while in dataset 2 27 stations were left out at the end corresponding similarly to 79 of the training set the models were recalculated using the reduced training sets and the results were compared to the previously used validation stations see above due to high demand in computational resources in the case of rerf the rarefaction was carried out at a lower resolution i e pairs of stations were removed in one step for even more specifics the reader is referred to the used r code supplement section 4 2 4 software used variography was conducted using the gstat package version 2 0 9 pebesma 2004 the lasso regression was calculated using the glmnet package friedman et al 2010 and the rf mrrf rerf models are grown using 500 decision trees each and the specific parameter values for e g node size and mtry were determined by the tune function of randomforestsrc package version 3 1 1 ishwaran et al 2021 ishwaran et al 2008 in r r core team 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 importance of predictors the importance of the predictors was assessed for all models rf rk mrrf and rerf it should be noted that no uniform metric yet exists therefore the comparison is done using the relative importance of the predictors for each approach for both datasets the following metrics were applied variable importance for rf fig s6 left column adjusted r 2 for rk mrrf fig s6 middle column and normalized lasso regression coefficient using the agresti and coull 1998 method for rerf fig s6 right column the geographical position of the stations x y coordinates are generally considered to be important predictors bowen and wilkinson 2002 dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 and indeed in the case of dataset1 are among the strongest first two predictors in the case of the linear fig s6b e h and among the strongest four in the case of the non linear approaches fig s6 dataset 1 left and right columns on the contrary precipitation seems unimportant in the case of the linear models fig s6 middle column and sect 2 2 1 in the meanwhile precipitation leads the set of predictors regarding their importance in the case of rf and rerf fig s6a c on 23 jan and can also be considered meaningful on 25 january fig s6g i suggesting a non linear relationship with δ 18o in precipitation tmin was the leading variable in the case of rk and mrrf fig s6b on 23 january and taken as important on 24 january fig s6e it was also among the most important predictors in the case of all approaches on 25 january fig s6g i in the case of dataset 2 we first focus on altitude which is traditionally an important predictor in the region kern et al 2014 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 it takes the leading role in the non linear methods july is a special case see sect 2 2 1 in which both the nonlinear approaches e g fig s6p s and even multiple regression fig s6r considered precipitation as an important predictor 3 2 comparison of the interpolation schemes the mse values ranged from 2 43 to 6 36 and for the kge values stood above 0 7 without any remarkable differences considering the rk rf mrrf and rerf methods in case of the daily data dataset 1 fig 2 a c in case of the dataset 2 the mse values ranged from 0 52 to 2 69 fig 2 b relatively larger errors occurred for january and october but generally smaller errors were seen compared to dataset 1 the kge values for dataset 2 fig 2 b d were usually also above 0 7 the exceptions are the traditional methods rk in july considering both variants the performance of the two ml approaches mrrf and rerf was comparable with mrrf producing somewhat smaller mse fig 2 a b and bigger nonparametric kge values fig 2 c d closer to one indicating better predictions in contrast the standard rf method produced the highest mse among all methods in dataset 1 peaking on 23 january mse 6 4 this was the date when the data range was greatest fig s1 hashimoto et al 2019 the error metrics calculated between the measured and predicted sample values are usually utilized to evaluate the performance of interpolation methods burrough et al 1998 mse employed here fundamentally provides estimates of the average error but does not provide information about the relative size of the average difference and the nature of differences willmott 1982 therefore the absolute differences between the measured and predicted values of δ 18o were calculated for each validation ensemble member sect 2 3 and compiled for the observed time points in dataset1 fig 3 a and dataset2 fig 3 b to get a detailed picture on the error distribution the distribution of the absolute differences fig 3 follows a similar pattern as the mse fig 2 a b the ml methods gave a smaller interquartile interval of absolute errors than rk in dataset2 fig 3 b in every month and two out of three days in dataset1 fig 3 a the median of absolute differences obtained with the ml methods combined with regression analysis were smaller median 1 6 for mrrf 1 9 for rerf than the ones obtained with the common rf 2 1 for rf in the case of dataset 1 especially mrrf on 23 january in dataset 1 however in the case of dataset 2 the ml methods especially rerf performed better than the geostatistical interpolation in all cases considering the median values fig 3 b the inability of rf to extrapolate is a well known problem hashimoto et al 2019 there was a significant difference in the mse values of the two datasets fig 2 a b with the range of dataset 1 being significantly greater than that of dataset 2 fig s1 in dataset2 the smaller range of errors may be due to the better spatial distribution of the station data fig 1 the advantage of rf application over rk is that it can manifest itself in quasi automated interpolation of environmental isotopic parameters especially where the point sampling is representative extrapolation minimized hengl et al 2018 in the future the precision of the ml estimations could be further increased by including the buffer distances between the grid cells and the station data as a predictor e g in hengl et al 2018 or by even adding a weight function to these predictors based on their distances sekulić et al 2020 it should be noted that one of the main advantages of ml methods over classical geostatistical ones is that these require less knowledge about the spatial autocorrelation structure of the data which is a major disadvantage at the same time hengl et al 2007 on the other hand these ml tools such as the most recent one applied in predicting water δ 18o are not able to assess the spatial autocorrelation structure of the monitoring network nelson et al 2021 where the data originates from unlike the previously mentioned geostatistical tools e g hatvani et al 2021 3 3 model sensitivity to decreased station density as a last step the decrease in prediction potential was investigated with respect to artificial rarefaction of the monitoring stations see sect 2 3 for details in the case of dataset 1 the rerf and rf methods gave the highest mse values most of the time on 23 and 25 january while on 24 january the rerf predicted the best results up to a station density reduced by 50 fig 4 the performance of mrrf on 24 and 25 january sustained its initial performance up to a substantial rarefaction of the station data ca 50 60 the mse in the case of rk method indicates a similar pattern as mrrf on 25 january however increases to a steeper extent on 23 and 24 january fig 4 a resembling the pattern of rf but with lower values for dataset 2 rk performed the worst in july whether the precipitation was included or excluded fig 4 b in all other cases it maintains good performance up to a station density reduced by 50 60 rf and mrrf performed similarly well tolerating a reduction in input data to about 50 without any drop in performance afterward the error attributed to the interpolation performance begins to increase with a much steeper gradient for rf while mrrf indicates a much more moderate increase moreover the initial good performance of mrrf is sustained in january april and october up to even 80 station density reduction fig 4 b in the case of rerf its prediction performance was sustained up to 50 and 80 of station reduction for january and october respectively regarding rk it should be noted that the underlying theoretical semivariograms did not change to a great extent depending on the degree of rarefaction fig s3 regarding their main characteristics and types cressie 1993 this highlights the robustness of the spatial autocorrelation structure against rarefaction implying that the pattern seen prevails relatively independent of the chosen subset of sites overall mrrf seems to better reproduce the spatial variability of the two datasets even under circumstances with more than 50 of the sites not providing information similar conclusions were recently drawn regarding the robustness and less sensitivity of ml models towards stations density and their less dependency on expert knowledge comparing their performances with linear models in high resolution monthly precipitation interpolation zandi et al 2022 4 conclusions and outlook in this study the performance of four interpolation approaches was compared using two datasets of precipitation δ 18o to understand how the interpolation schemes behave under various circumstances of spatial distribution organization in order to determine which interpolation approach to utilize for producing isoscapes of different scales the results indicate that machine learning algorithms are more than capable of creating continuous datasets of precipitation stable isotopes of even superior quality than the classical geostatistical tools which were formerly considered as the gold standard in this discipline in particular machine learning methods tolerated the rarefaction of the dataset to a much greater extent especially above 50 of the data removed indicating that they can be employed with the expectation of producing comparably accurate predictions if one or more stations become inoperable or in regions where monitoring stations are sparser or unevenly distributed moreover machine learning tools require less expert knowledge in handling the predictors are less sensitive to outliers and no stationarity assumption is needed to be followed nor is there a need to deal with anisotropy or fitting variograms bataille et al 2018 hengl et al 2018 as in the case of regression kriging on the other hand unlike regression kriging machine learning algorithms do not provide overall information about the spatial autocorrelation structure of precipitation δ 18o in the studied regions nor is it possible to estimate the representativity of the assessed monitoring network based on the results the application of a random forest algorithm is highly viable option for deriving isoscapes of subcontinental continental extent especially if the practical advantages of machine learning tools over their geostatistical counterparts are considered equipping these tools to take into account additional complex predictors for instance buffer distances hengl et al 2018 or weight functions derived from δ p values e g sekulić et al 2020 is expected to further improve their

2346,developing roots in deep soil is an important strategy for trees enabling them to resist prolonged drought particularly in drylands however the impact of deep root water uptake on photosynthesis is still not fully understood an experiment partitioning deep soil and roots below 200 cm was undertaken at a dryland apple malus pumila mill tree plantation on the loess plateau of china to examine the photosynthetic responses of apple trees to deep soil water deficit by characterizing seasonal changes in stomatal and nonstomatal limitation across years it was evident that deep soil water deficit led to severe water stress in the partitioned treatment leaf hydraulic conductance k leaf 28 58 and midday leaf water potential ψ md 14 44 significantly decreased without adjustment even in the wet season deep soil water deficit significantly impacted stomatal limitation by imposing average reductions of stomatal conductance g s photosynthesis rate a and transpiration rate t by 38 26 and 34 while increasing leaf water use efficiency wue by 36 during the dry seasons however these parameters recovered well in the wet season in contrast no significant differences in nonstomatal limitation occurred between treatments despite the trees suffering from severe drought stress these results indicate that deep soil water deficit affected photosynthesis by reducing stomatal conductance but not by damaging the photosynthetic apparatus even under severe drought keywords deep soil drought leaf hydraulic conductance photosynthesis stomatal limitation nonstomatal limitation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increasing frequency and intensity of droughts can cause widespread tree mortality in water limited regions with profound effects on water and carbon balance choat et al 2018 in drylands trees with deep root systems can access deep soil water to cope with drought stress pierret et al 2016 fan et al 2017 christina et al 2017 huo et al 2020 this is especially true on china s loess plateau where massive tree plantations established with the aim of controlling soil erosion depend on soil water in deep layers 200 cm to survive during prolonged drought jia et al 2017 gao et al 2018 wang et al 2022 although the importance of deep root water uptake has been studied its effect on photosynthesis has seldom been quantified limiting our ability to predict vegetation dynamics under changing climate conditions particularly in drought vulnerable ecosystems photosynthesis is the source of the carbon skeleton critical for trees to sustain their structure and growth flexas and carriqui 2020 and it is subject to both stomatal and nonstomatal limitations salmon et al 2020 stomatal limitation is defined as a restricted co2 supply caused by diffusion through the stomatal to leaf interspaces while nonstomatal limitation is the reduction in photosynthetic rate caused by all other processes including biochemical limitations to photosynthetic efficiency grassi and magnani 2005 stomatal limitation is ephemeral and can be reversed once the drought ends but nonstomatal limitation may last longer due to the effects on the leaf photosynthetic framework requiring costly water and carbon resources flexas and medrano 2002 zhou et al 2013 the distinction between decreases in photosynthesis due to stomatal closure versus decreases by impairing leaf biochemistry is extremely vital in terms of implications for the prolonged drought response of trees water stress is well known to directly affect plant photosynthesis galmes et al 2007 javier cano et al 2014 dos santos et al 2018 reductions in photosynthesis in response to short term water stress have been linked to decreases in co2 assimilation and stomatal conductance drake et al 2017 with increasing drought severity prolonged water stress will reduce photosynthesis by decreasing photochemical processes such as the maximum

transport j max resco et al 2008 misson et al 2010 bhusal et al 2020 deep soil water plays a key role in tree physiological performance jiang et al 2020 tumber davila and malhotra 2020 recent studies have reported that photosynthesis can rely on deep soil water enabling trees to maintain relatively higher rates of photosynthesis in water limited ecosystems or dry environments kelly et al 2016 zunzunegui et al 2018 for example chen et al 2015 showed that liana trees in a karst forest had much higher photosynthesis and transpiration rates during the wet season and a minor ratio drop in photosynthesis rate during the dry season because trees have well developed deep roots systems allowing them to absorb deep soil water and sustain higher growth during the dry season moreover drake et al 2011 revealed that trees had a higher f v f m than seedlings during the dry season which could be due to the absorption of soil water in deep layers besides several studies have shown that deep soil water uptake could help trees to avoid hydraulic failure by buffering declines in leaf water potential ψ leaf and leaf hydraulic conductance k leaf ding et al 2021 pivovaroff et al 2021 while the importance of deep soil water for plant physiological performance has often been studied there is a surprising paucity of studies on how deep soil water limits plant photosynthesis e g does it involve stomatal limitation nonstomatal limitation or both knowledge of the impact of deep soil water on tree photosynthesis will help understand the responses of dryland trees to drought in semiarid ecosystems apple trees are the dominant economic tree plantations on the dryland loess plateau of china due to its remarkable economic benefits apple orchards on the loess plateau expanded rapidly during the last two decades with their production exceeding one quarter of the global totals yang et al 2020 numerous studies have indicated that apple trees with deep roots may make considerable use of deep soil water wang et al 2015 li et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 however this water is difficult to recover once consumed in this context the aim of this study is to disentangle how

randomly selected as experimental trees fig 2b we used iron sheets to isolate the experimental trees from the surrounding trees to reduce the influence of neighboring trees on the water balance fig 2c as the trees fine roots are distributed mainly within the top 1 m of soil fig s2 the isolation depth of the iron sheet was 1 m with lateral root water absorption assumed negligible below 1 m in april 2018 ech20 em 50 sensors inserted at 20 60 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 cm depths for each tree were used to measure soil volumetric water content swc at 15 min intervals in the control and partitioned treatments the partitioned plots had polyethylene pe isolation boards 3 0 m 2 5 m 1 cm thick inserted to isolate the soil above and below 200 cm fig 2a details on the partitioning of deep soils and roots are available in yang et al 2022 and presented in fig s3 precipitation air temperature and relative humidity were measured every 30 min by an automated weather station dynamax co usa close to the experimental field during study period the vapor pressure deficit was calculated basing on air temperature and relative humidity ultimately a 4 year experiment isolating deep soil roots in a dryland apple tree plantation on the loess plateau was established to test the adaptive capacity of trees by characterizing their physiological responses to a lack of deep soil water access here we empirically measured tree hydraulic traits ψ pd ψ md and photosynthesis traits g s a e wue f v f m ф psii and j max 2 3 leaf traits leaf traits were measured in two dry seasons on may 17 june 20 and july 29 2020 and may 13 june 22 july 31 august 17 and september 21 2021 and one wet season on august 10 and september 2 2020 ψ pd 5 30 6 30 and ψ md 12 00 13 00 were recorded on sunny days using a model 1505d pressure chamber details of the sampling method are described in yang et al 2022 in addition we also calculated k leaf mmol m 2 mpa 1 s 1 assuming that trees had reached equilibrium with

al 2022 chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were recorded using a pam 2500 fluorometer heinz walz gmbh effeltrich germany leaves were dark adapted for 30 min then exposed to light with a saturation intensity of 1 353 μmol m 2 s 1 representative of a fully sunlit day the leaf was irradiated with detection light and the initial fluorescence f o was obtained under a weak pulse of light next a saturating pulse of light was used to obtain the maximum fluorescence f m f v f m was calculated as f m f 0 f m tan and whitlow 2001 an actinic light source was then used to attain reliable

fitted fast light response curve 2 4 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to explore differences in swc soil water storage hydraulic treats and photosynthetic traits

weather varied visibly across the four years of the study fig 3 a overall most of the precipitation falls in the growing season from april to september the precipitation during the growing seasons of 2018 482 9 mm 2019 399 5 mm 2020 411 9 mm and 2021 250 6 mm accounted respectively for 124 2 102 8 105 9 and 64 5 of the main growing season precipitation from 2000 to 2021 388 6 mm in particular april to july 2020 dry spell i recorded only 90 2 mm of rainfall or 44 0 of the multi year mean for the same period 204 8 mm thus this period was classified as a dry season fig 3b and c conversely august to september 2020 recorded 330 4 mm of rainfall 1 8 times the multi year mean for the same period 183 9 mm thus this period was classified as a wet season april to september 2021 received 250 6 mm of rainfall equivalent to only 64 5 of the multi year mean for the same period fig 3b thus the entire growing season was classified as a dry season the prolonged drought in 2020 2021 provided an opportunity to assess the physiological responses of trees to deep soil water deficit as expected soil water from 200 to 450 cm in the control plots gradually decreased over time due to deep root water uptake but in the partitioned plots it was significantly p 0 001 higher fig s4 in the partitioned plots soil water storage values in the shallow soil layers 0 200 cm significantly p 0 001 decreased relative to control plots fig s5 3 2 leaf water potential and leaf hydraulic conductance the lack of deep soil water significantly affected ψ md and k leaf in 2020 and 2021 fig 4 in the dry and wet seasons of 2020 and dry season of 2021 the values of ψ md in partitioned plots were 2 9 0 23 2 3 0 06 and 3 0 0 59 mpa representing decreases of 29 p 0 001 44 p 0 01 and 14 p 0 05 respectively compared to control plots the corresponding values for k leaf were 1 14 1 77 and 0 52 mmol m 2 s 1 mpa 1 representing declines of 58 p 0 001 52 p 0 01 and 28 p 0 05 respectively relative to control plots in contrast ψ pd did not change in response to the partitioning treatment p 0 05 in the wet season of 2020 and the dry season of 2021 3 3 leaf gas exchange the partitioning significantly affected most leaf gas exchange parameters during the dry seasons in 2020 and 2021 fig 5 decreasing p 0 05 g s 42 and 34 respectively a 29 and 23 respectively and e 46 and 24 respectively and increasing p 0 05 wue 56 and 16 respectively relative to the control plots however none of the leaf gas exchange parameters significantly p 0 05 differed between treatments during the wet season in 2020 3 4 chlorophyll fluorescence and j max f v f m ф psii and j max values in the control plots ranged from 0 68 to 0 80 0 13 0 48 and 85 7 272 3 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively during the study period and followed a similar pattern in the partitioned plots ranging from 0 62 to 0 81 0 12 0 50 and 76 5 263 5 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively fig 6 no significant differences occurred between the control and partitioned treatments in any season 3 5 relationships between shallow swc and leaf traits the lack of deep soil water stimulated root water uptake from the upper 200 cm reducing shallow swc figs s4 and s5 analyzing the relationship between shallow swc and leaf traits is necessary to gain a further understanding of the effects of deep soil water deficit on trees physiological performance partitioning produced a large range of values for shallow swc fig 7 with consistent effects on leaf hydraulic performance and photosynthetic parameters the observed values generally increased with increasing shallow swc in the dry seasons except wue which decreased with increasing shallow swc fig 7 the shallow swc significantly p 0 05 affected leaf hydraulic and gas exchange traits however in contrast to f v f m ф psii and j max the effect was not significant 4 discussion as the source of carbohydrates photosynthesis is a dominant driver for tree productivity and critical for carbon assimilation flexas and carriqui 2020 trees absorb soil water by developing deep roots that presumably facilitate the maintenance of higher rates of photosynthesis particularly in water limited ecosystems zunzunegui et al 2018 deep soil water has been well studied in terms of plant physiology broedel et al 2017 chitra tarak et al 2021 miguez macho and fan 2021 but a few studies have quantified the role that deep soil water has in affecting photosynthesis hence we empirically tested the effect of deep soil water on photosynthetic processes such as stomatal and nonstomatal limitations in a 4 year experiment of partitioning roots and soils in deep layers 200 cm from shallow layers 200 cm 4 1 stomatal limitation in response to deep soil water deficit the shallow swc 0 200 cm significantly decreased in the partitioned plots fig s4i k and s5a c due to the lack of access to deep soil stimulating trees to develop shallow root system fig s2 thus partitioned plots increased the proportion of shallow water uptake resulting in inadequate water availability and increased water stress consequently partitioned trees had lower values for ψ pd ψ md and k leaf than the control trees across years fig 4 particularly for ψ md and k leaf that did not recover in response to precipitation after the severe drought in 2020 indicating that trees that cannot access deep soil water during prolonged drought may suffer greater hydraulic risk similarly bittencourt et al 2020 found that trees subjected to moisture deficit experienced significantly lower leaf water potential and hydraulic damage caused by embolism putting them at greater risk of drought induced mortality deep roots play a significant role in water resource acquisition tumber davila and malhotra 2020 and are thus a major component of hydraulic resistance in trees abdalla et al 2022 changes in the functioning of deep roots could drive a decline in plant hydraulic systems during water stress rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 chitra tarak et al 2021 partitioning during the dry seasons significantly p 0 05 reduced g s a and e but no such reductions occurred during the wet season fig 5 studies have linked deep soil water to the stomatal limitation of photosynthesis trees with deep root systems can absorb deep soil water helping them regulate stomatal conductance photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate fort et al 2017 dos santos et al 2018 abdalla et al 2022 yang et al 2022 for instance trees in the daintree rainforest of northeast australia showed homeostatic maintenance of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate in a dry season due to their access to deep soil water pivovaroff et al 2021 previous studies also reported that the progressively greater relative ratio of deep soil water uptake helped maintain the transpiration rate during drought gessler et al 2022 marchionni et al 2019 verma et al 2014 root dynamics during water stress are an important driver of stomatal closure abdalla et al 2022 tested the below ground hydraulics of a long and short rooted tomato variety confirming that root system changes greatly affected stomatal conductance during soil drying they also demonstrated that deep roots play a vital role in buffering the decline of stomatal conductance and transpiration in our study the partitioned trees which lacked the compensatory effect of deep soil water were more likely to exhibit a clear reduction in stomatal conductance photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate during drought than the control trees stomatal regulation is closely linked to k leaf and decreasing k leaf can induce stomatal closure yao et al 2021 partitioned trees under water stress decreased k leaf driving stomatal closure and thus decreasing photosynthesis and transpiration rates however partitioned trees had higher wue than control trees during the dry seasons fig 5 this could be due to the trees photosynthesizing under a lower g s and thus lower e by actively regulating stomatal aperture under drought stress and thus increasing wue at the leaf level peters et al 2018 overall while some reductions in photosynthetic traits were associated with stomatal limitation all partitioned trees recovered to control levels in the wet season fig 5 obviously there are still some other factors that warrant rigorous attention leaf and root traits are not the only indicators of plant performance as xylem traits and their hydraulic structure are vitally important they are closely connected to the water use strategy and performance of a plant in a given environment matheny et al 2017 vilagrosa et al 2014 xylem cavitation and embolism may result in a reduxtion of plant hydraulic conductance which reduces gas exchange rates and photosynthetic productivity and also exposes plants to the risk of hydraulic failure savi et al 2015 leaf stem and root traits of the whole plant hydraulic strategy control stomatal conductance and thus both transpiration and photosynthesis matheny et al 2017 thus these characteristics of apple trees especially the xylem architecture warrant attention in future studies such knowledge is vital for clarifying the response of apple trees hydrodynamics to prodongled drought stress from a synergistic whole tree approach 4 2 nonstomatal processes not impaired by deep soil water deficit as the severity and duration of drought increases photosynthesis is controlled mainly by nonstomatal limitation galle et al 2007 and other processes associated with photosynthesis can be influenced such as photochemical processes including psii misson et al 2010 manzi et al 2022 as a protein complex psii can use light to mobilize electrons which are transferred to psi to build reducing agents ahrens et al 2021 drought stress oxides psii proteins adequately breaking the electron excitation process and leading to drought induced destruction of psii and thus decreasing f v f m ф psii and j max in general f v f m ф psii and j max can be used to assess the status of the photosynthetic pathway gu et al 2019 salmon et al 2020 ahrens et al 2021 often as a proxy for estimating the nonstomatal limitation of photosynthesis as reported elsewhere we hypothesized a decline in f v f m ф psii and j max in apple trees exposed to deep soil water deficit resco et al 2008 ishida et al 2014 bhusal et al 2020 counterintuitively f v f m ф psii and j max were not impaired in partitioned trees during 2020 and 2021 with no significant differences in nonstomatal limitation of photosynthesis changes in f v f m ф psii and j max between partitioned and control trees fig 6 suggesting that even the severe drought in 2020 did not inflict long term adverse effects on psii this is probably because the soil water content may not have reached the critical threshold for water stress the point at which nonstomatal limitation starts to decrease due to the swc deficit for instance teodoro et al 2021 measured leaf water potential in vellozia species in water stress experiments simulating extreme drought and reported that ψ pd and ψ md exceeding 2 5 and 4 1 mpa may cause irreversible damage to plants on the other hand trees can adapt to drought stress through morphological and physiological adjustments liu et al 2022 including reducing leaf area schönbeck et al 2022 or advancing the peak season for photosynthesis xu et al 2016 in our study the fact that nonstomatal limitation did not change in partitioned trees may be due to structural acclimation such as a smaller leaf area relative to control trees table s1 limiting water losses while allowing a higher per leaf area photosynthesis capacity such lasting structural variation can in turn adjustment gas exchange rate as well as the sensitivity of stomatal and photosynthetic apparatus to drought stress the lines for nonstomatal limitation slopes in fig 7 had significantly lower slopes than those for stomatal limitation indicating a lower sensitivity to long term shallow swc changes similarly schonbeck et al 2022 suggested that long term release from soil drought decreases the sensitivity of nonstomatal limitation to increasing vpd and soil drying over a decadal scale our results revealed that apple trees can effectively take advantage of shallow soil water and intermittent rainfall events underlining the capacity of these trees to withstand and survive severe drought even when lacking access to deep soil resources similarly rowland et al 2015 reported that tropical rainforest trees sustain photosynthetic ability in terms of j max v cmax after a long soil moisture deficit by exploiting short lived periods of high availability of shallow soil moisture another study demonstrated that terminalia sericea in a mesic savanna obtained most of its water resources from the shallow soil layers verweij et al 2011 ultimately our study demonstrated that the lack of deep soil water had limited capacity to influence the photochemical processes of apple trees presenting extraordinary physiological plasticity to cope under these conditions this has significant implications for long term ecosystem functioning under soil drying conditions in the face of climate change 4 3 theoretical insights and practical implications we provide a conceptual model for understanding how deep soil water deficit impacts photosynthesis during periods of drought in a dryland apple tree plantation fig 8 we demonstrated that deep soil water deficit increases water stress making ψ leaf more negative during drought at the same time k leaf decreases via a number of physiological mechanisms such as the destruction of leaf veins and regulation of cell membrane aquaporins zhang et al 2016 mcelrone et al 2007 in addition the release of the phytohormone abscisic acid under water stress induces stomatal closure yao et al 2021 decreasing a and e however we observed no significant effect of deep soil water deficit on the nonstomatal limitation of photosynthesis even during severe drought these findings reveal that apple trees could take advantage of shallow soil resources to maintain growth under drought our finding is significant for the gradual depletion of deep soil water wang et al 2011 jia et al 2019 wang et al 2023 with critical implications for carbon assimilation and vegetation dynamics in drylands under future climate change the nonstomatal limitation of the response of apple trees to deep soil water deficit warrants attention especially when soil water stress exceeds a critical swc threshold which may decrease nonstomatal limitation by damaging chlorophyll bhusal et al 2020 decreasing solar energy utilization galmes et al 2007 and rubisco activity parry et al 2002 and limiting rubp regeneration bota et al 2004 although the impact of deep soil water deficit on photosynthetic traits was surprisingly limited this study s results suggest that the decline in k leaf and ψ md shown no adjustment in response to the imposing deep soil water deficit even in the wet season indicating that the inability to access deep soil water during prolonged drought may result in hydraulic damage overall further studies are needed over longer timescales and considering the possible adaptation and physiological plasticity of trees if they cannot access deep soil resources in addition numerical modeling has promised an effective approach tree crown hydrodynamics model fetch3 is one such model that modelling the above and belowground water transport with a range of stem and root xylem hydraulic characteristics silva et al 2022 further efforts can incorporate fetch3 model to explore plant responses to water stress and xylem processes across the soil plant atmosphere continuum 5 conclusion understanding how deep soil water affects tree photosynthesis is essential for predicting the persistence and functioning of vegetation under future climate change in water limited ecosystems we explicitly quantified how deep soil water content limits leaf level photosynthesis in a 4 year experiment that partitioned the deep roots 200 cm of apple trees in a water limited ecosystem stomatal limitation of photosynthesis was more susceptible to deep soil water deficit in dry seasons effective recovery occurred in wet seasons in contrast nonstomatal limitation of photosynthesis in partitioned trees did not change in response to reduced deep soil water even during severe drought suggesting that trees adapt to environmental change through homeostatic regulation however more drastic changes in precipitation patterns or prolonged drought might negatively impact trees e g fruit yield and quality especially in species with low plasticity of hydraulic traits this study offers insights into the role of deep soil water in plant photosynthetic functions with significant implications for vegetation dynamics under climate change credit authorship contribution statement min yang

2346,developing roots in deep soil is an important strategy for trees enabling them to resist prolonged drought particularly in drylands however the impact of deep root water uptake on photosynthesis is still not fully understood an experiment partitioning deep soil and roots below 200 cm was undertaken at a dryland apple malus pumila mill tree plantation on the loess plateau of china to examine the photosynthetic responses of apple trees to deep soil water deficit by characterizing seasonal changes in stomatal and nonstomatal limitation across years it was evident that deep soil water deficit led to severe water stress in the partitioned treatment leaf hydraulic conductance k leaf 28 58 and midday leaf water potential ψ md 14 44 significantly decreased without adjustment even in the wet season deep soil water deficit significantly impacted stomatal limitation by imposing average reductions of stomatal conductance g s photosynthesis rate a and transpiration rate t by 38 26 and 34 while increasing leaf water use efficiency wue by 36 during the dry seasons however these parameters recovered well in the wet season in contrast no significant differences in nonstomatal limitation occurred between treatments despite the trees suffering from severe drought stress these results indicate that deep soil water deficit affected photosynthesis by reducing stomatal conductance but not by damaging the photosynthetic apparatus even under severe drought keywords deep soil drought leaf hydraulic conductance photosynthesis stomatal limitation nonstomatal limitation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increasing frequency and intensity of droughts can cause widespread tree mortality in water limited regions with profound effects on water and carbon balance choat et al 2018 in drylands trees with deep root systems can access deep soil water to cope with drought stress pierret et al 2016 fan et al 2017 christina et al 2017 huo et al 2020 this is especially true on china s loess plateau where massive tree plantations established with the aim of controlling soil erosion depend on soil water in deep layers 200 cm to survive during prolonged drought jia et al 2017 gao et al 2018 wang et al 2022 although the importance of deep root water uptake has been studied its effect on photosynthesis has seldom been quantified limiting our ability to predict vegetation dynamics under changing climate conditions particularly in drought vulnerable ecosystems photosynthesis is the source of the carbon skeleton critical for trees to sustain their structure and growth flexas and carriqui 2020 and it is subject to both stomatal and nonstomatal limitations salmon et al 2020 stomatal limitation is defined as a restricted co2 supply caused by diffusion through the stomatal to leaf interspaces while nonstomatal limitation is the reduction in photosynthetic rate caused by all other processes including biochemical limitations to photosynthetic efficiency grassi and magnani 2005 stomatal limitation is ephemeral and can be reversed once the drought ends but nonstomatal limitation may last longer due to the effects on the leaf photosynthetic framework requiring costly water and carbon resources flexas and medrano 2002 zhou et al 2013 the distinction between decreases in photosynthesis due to stomatal closure versus decreases by impairing leaf biochemistry is extremely vital in terms of implications for the prolonged drought response of trees water stress is well known to directly affect plant photosynthesis galmes et al 2007 javier cano et al 2014 dos santos et al 2018 reductions in photosynthesis in response to short term water stress have been linked to decreases in co2 assimilation and stomatal conductance drake et al 2017 with increasing drought severity prolonged water stress will reduce photosynthesis by decreasing photochemical processes such as the maximum efficiency of quantum yield f v f m with f v and f m being the variable fluorescence and maximum fluorescence respectively actual efficiency of quantum yield ф psii and maximum rate of electron transport j max resco et al 2008 misson et al 2010 bhusal et al 2020 deep soil water plays a key role in tree physiological performance jiang et al 2020 tumber davila and malhotra 2020 recent studies have reported that photosynthesis can rely on deep soil water enabling trees to maintain relatively higher rates of photosynthesis in water limited ecosystems or dry environments kelly et al 2016 zunzunegui et al 2018 for example chen et al 2015 showed that liana trees in a karst forest had much higher photosynthesis and transpiration rates during the wet season and a minor ratio drop in photosynthesis rate during the dry season because trees have well developed deep roots systems allowing them to absorb deep soil water and sustain higher growth during the dry season moreover drake et al 2011 revealed that trees had a higher f v f m than seedlings during the dry season which could be due to the absorption of soil water in deep layers besides several studies have shown that deep soil water uptake could help trees to avoid hydraulic failure by buffering declines in leaf water potential ψ leaf and leaf hydraulic conductance k leaf ding et al 2021 pivovaroff et al 2021 while the importance of deep soil water for plant physiological performance has often been studied there is a surprising paucity of studies on how deep soil water limits plant photosynthesis e g does it involve stomatal limitation nonstomatal limitation or both knowledge of the impact of deep soil water on tree photosynthesis will help understand the responses of dryland trees to drought in semiarid ecosystems apple trees are the dominant economic tree plantations on the dryland loess plateau of china due to its remarkable economic benefits apple orchards on the loess plateau expanded rapidly during the last two decades with their production exceeding one quarter of the global totals yang et al 2020 numerous studies have indicated that apple trees with deep roots may make considerable use of deep soil water wang et al 2015 li et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 however this water is difficult to recover once consumed in this context the aim of this study is to disentangle how soil water in deep layers 2 m affect photosynthesis in an apple tree plantation the following hypotheses were tested 1 partitioned trees have more negative predawn ψ pd and midday ψ md water potential and lower k leaf during drought than control trees and 2 drought reduces stomatal limitations of photosynthesis stomatal conductance g s photosynthesis rate a transpiration rate e and leaf water use efficiency wue in partitioned trees but has little effect on nonstomatal limitations f v f m ф psii j max 2 materials and methods 2 1 site we performed a 4 year field experiment in an apple tree

growing conditions while the partitioning treatment separated the deep roots from the shallow layers fig 2 a each treatment comprised three plots each with sixteen trees three trees in each plot were randomly selected as experimental trees fig 2b we used iron sheets to isolate the experimental trees from the surrounding trees to reduce the influence of neighboring trees on the water balance fig 2c as the trees fine roots are distributed mainly within the top 1 m of soil fig s2 the isolation depth of the iron sheet was 1 m with lateral root water absorption assumed negligible below 1 m in april 2018 ech20 em 50 sensors inserted at 20 60 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 cm depths for each tree were used to measure soil volumetric water content swc at 15 min intervals in the control and partitioned treatments the partitioned plots had polyethylene pe isolation boards 3 0 m 2 5 m 1 cm thick inserted to isolate the soil above and below 200 cm fig 2a details on the partitioning of deep soils and roots are available in yang et al 2022 and presented in fig s3 precipitation air temperature and relative humidity were measured every 30 min by an automated weather station dynamax co usa close to the experimental field during study period the vapor pressure deficit was calculated basing on air temperature and relative humidity ultimately a 4 year experiment isolating deep soil roots

april to july 2020 dry spell i recorded only 90 2 mm of rainfall or 44 0 of the multi year mean for the same period 204 8 mm thus this period was classified as a dry season fig 3b and c conversely

mm of rainfall equivalent to only 64 5 of the multi year mean for the same period fig 3b thus the entire growing season was classified as a dry season the prolonged drought in 2020 2021 provided an opportunity to assess the physiological responses of trees to deep soil water deficit as expected soil water from 200 to 450 cm in the control plots gradually decreased over time due to deep root water uptake but in the partitioned plots it was significantly p 0 001 higher fig s4 in the partitioned plots soil water storage values in the shallow soil layers 0 200 cm significantly p 0 001 decreased relative to control plots fig s5 3 2 leaf water potential and leaf hydraulic conductance the lack of deep soil water significantly affected ψ md and k leaf in 2020 and 2021 fig 4 in the dry and wet seasons of 2020 and dry season of 2021 the values of ψ md in partitioned plots were 2 9 0 23 2 3 0 06 and 3 0 0 59 mpa representing decreases of 29 p 0 001 44 p 0 01 and 14 p 0 05 respectively compared to control plots the corresponding values for k leaf were 1 14 1 77 and 0 52 mmol m 2 s 1 mpa 1 representing declines of 58 p 0 001 52 p 0 01 and 28 p 0 05 respectively relative to control plots in contrast ψ pd did not change in response to the partitioning treatment p 0 05 in the wet season of 2020 and the dry season of 2021 3 3 leaf gas exchange the partitioning significantly affected most leaf gas exchange parameters during the dry seasons in 2020 and 2021 fig 5 decreasing p 0 05 g s 42 and 34 respectively a 29 and 23 respectively and e 46 and 24 respectively and increasing p 0 05 wue 56 and 16 respectively relative to the control plots however none of the leaf gas exchange parameters significantly p 0 05 differed between treatments during the wet season in 2020 3 4 chlorophyll fluorescence and j max f v f m ф psii and j max values in the control plots ranged from 0 68 to 0 80 0 13 0 48 and 85 7 272 3 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively during the study period and followed a similar pattern in the partitioned plots ranging from 0 62 to 0 81 0 12 0 50 and 76 5 263 5 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively fig 6 no significant differences occurred between the control and partitioned treatments in any season 3 5 relationships between shallow swc and leaf traits the lack of deep soil water stimulated root water uptake from the upper 200 cm reducing shallow swc figs s4 and s5 analyzing the relationship between shallow swc and leaf traits is necessary to gain a further understanding of the effects of deep soil water deficit on trees physiological performance partitioning produced a large range of values for shallow swc fig 7 with consistent effects on leaf hydraulic performance and photosynthetic parameters the observed values generally increased with increasing shallow swc in the dry seasons except wue which decreased with increasing shallow swc fig 7 the shallow swc significantly p 0 05 affected leaf hydraulic and gas exchange traits however in contrast to f v f m ф psii and j max the effect was not significant 4 discussion as the source of carbohydrates photosynthesis is a dominant driver for tree productivity and critical for carbon assimilation flexas and carriqui 2020 trees absorb soil water by developing deep roots that presumably facilitate the maintenance of higher rates of photosynthesis particularly in water limited ecosystems zunzunegui et al 2018 deep soil water has been well studied in terms of plant physiology broedel et al 2017 chitra tarak et al 2021 miguez macho and fan 2021 but a few studies have quantified the role that deep soil water has in affecting photosynthesis hence we empirically tested the effect of deep soil water on photosynthetic processes such as stomatal and nonstomatal limitations in a 4 year experiment of partitioning roots and soils in deep layers 200 cm from shallow layers 200 cm 4 1 stomatal limitation in response to deep soil water deficit the shallow swc 0 200 cm significantly decreased in the partitioned plots fig s4i k and s5a c due to the lack of access to deep soil stimulating trees to develop shallow root system fig s2 thus partitioned plots increased the proportion of shallow water uptake resulting in inadequate water availability and increased water stress consequently partitioned trees had lower values for ψ pd ψ md and k leaf than the control trees across years fig 4 particularly for ψ md and k leaf that did not recover in response to precipitation after the severe drought in 2020 indicating that trees that cannot access deep soil water during prolonged drought may suffer greater hydraulic risk similarly bittencourt et al 2020 found that trees subjected to moisture deficit experienced significantly lower leaf water potential and hydraulic damage caused by embolism putting them at greater risk of drought induced mortality deep roots play a significant role in water resource acquisition tumber davila and malhotra 2020 and are thus a major component of hydraulic resistance in trees abdalla et al 2022 changes in the functioning of deep roots could drive a decline in plant hydraulic systems during water stress rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 chitra tarak et al 2021 partitioning during the dry seasons significantly p 0 05 reduced g s a and e but no such reductions occurred during the wet season fig 5 studies have linked deep soil water to the stomatal limitation of photosynthesis trees with deep root systems can absorb deep soil water helping them regulate stomatal conductance photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate fort et al 2017 dos santos et al 2018 abdalla et al 2022 yang et al 2022 for instance trees in the daintree rainforest of northeast australia showed homeostatic maintenance of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate in a dry season due to their access to deep soil water pivovaroff et al 2021 previous studies also reported that the progressively greater relative ratio of deep soil water uptake helped maintain the transpiration rate during drought gessler et al 2022 marchionni et al 2019 verma et al 2014 root dynamics during water stress are an important driver of stomatal closure abdalla et al 2022 tested the below ground hydraulics of a long and short rooted tomato variety confirming that root system changes greatly affected stomatal conductance during soil drying they also demonstrated that deep roots play a vital role in buffering the decline of stomatal conductance and transpiration in our study the partitioned trees which lacked the compensatory effect of deep soil water were more likely to exhibit a clear reduction in stomatal conductance photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate during drought than the control trees stomatal regulation is closely linked to k leaf and decreasing k leaf can induce stomatal closure yao et al 2021 partitioned trees under water stress decreased k leaf driving stomatal closure and thus decreasing photosynthesis and transpiration rates however partitioned trees had higher wue than control trees during the dry seasons fig 5 this could be due to the trees photosynthesizing under a lower g s and thus lower e by actively regulating stomatal aperture under drought stress and thus increasing wue at the leaf level peters et al 2018 overall while some reductions in photosynthetic traits were associated with stomatal limitation all partitioned trees recovered to control levels in the wet season fig 5 obviously there are still some other factors that warrant rigorous attention leaf and root traits are not the only indicators of plant performance as xylem traits and their hydraulic structure are vitally important they are closely connected to the water use strategy and performance of a plant in a given environment matheny et al 2017 vilagrosa et al 2014 xylem cavitation and embolism may result in a reduxtion of plant hydraulic conductance which reduces gas exchange rates and photosynthetic productivity and also exposes plants to the risk of hydraulic failure savi et al 2015 leaf stem and root traits of the whole plant hydraulic strategy control stomatal conductance and thus both transpiration and photosynthesis matheny et al 2017 thus these characteristics of apple trees especially the xylem architecture warrant attention in future studies such knowledge is vital for clarifying the response of apple trees hydrodynamics to prodongled drought stress from a synergistic whole tree approach 4 2 nonstomatal processes not impaired by deep soil water deficit as the severity and duration of drought increases photosynthesis is controlled mainly by nonstomatal limitation galle et al 2007 and other processes associated with photosynthesis can be influenced such as photochemical processes including psii misson et al 2010 manzi et al 2022 as a protein complex psii can use light to mobilize electrons which are transferred to psi to build reducing agents ahrens et al 2021 drought stress oxides psii proteins adequately breaking the electron excitation process and leading to drought induced destruction of psii and thus decreasing f v f m ф psii and j max in general f v f m ф psii and j max can be used to assess the status of the photosynthetic pathway gu et al 2019 salmon et al 2020 ahrens et al 2021 often as a proxy for estimating the nonstomatal limitation of photosynthesis as reported elsewhere we hypothesized a decline in f v f m ф psii and j max in apple trees exposed to deep soil water deficit resco et al 2008 ishida et al 2014 bhusal et al 2020 counterintuitively f v f m ф psii and j max were not impaired in partitioned trees during 2020 and 2021 with no significant differences in nonstomatal limitation of photosynthesis changes in f v f m ф psii and j max between partitioned and control trees fig 6 suggesting that even the severe drought in 2020 did not inflict long term adverse effects on psii this is probably because the soil water content may not have reached the critical threshold for water stress the point at which nonstomatal limitation starts to decrease due to the swc deficit for instance teodoro et al 2021 measured leaf water potential in vellozia species in water stress experiments simulating extreme drought and reported that ψ pd and ψ md exceeding 2 5 and 4 1 mpa may cause irreversible damage to plants on the other hand trees can adapt to drought stress through morphological and physiological adjustments liu et al 2022 including reducing leaf area schönbeck et al 2022 or advancing the peak season for photosynthesis xu et al 2016 in our study the fact that nonstomatal limitation did not change in partitioned trees may be due to structural acclimation such as a smaller leaf area relative to control trees table s1 limiting water losses while allowing a higher per leaf area photosynthesis capacity such lasting structural variation can in turn adjustment gas exchange rate as well as the sensitivity of stomatal and photosynthetic apparatus to drought stress the lines for nonstomatal limitation slopes in fig 7 had significantly lower slopes than those for stomatal limitation indicating a lower sensitivity to long term shallow swc changes similarly schonbeck et al 2022 suggested that long term release from soil drought decreases the sensitivity of nonstomatal limitation to increasing vpd and soil drying over a decadal scale our results revealed that apple trees can effectively take advantage of shallow soil water and intermittent rainfall events underlining the capacity of these trees to withstand and survive severe drought even when lacking access to deep soil resources similarly rowland et al 2015 reported that tropical rainforest trees sustain photosynthetic ability in terms of j max v cmax after a long soil moisture deficit by exploiting short lived periods of high availability of shallow soil moisture another study demonstrated that terminalia sericea in a mesic savanna obtained most of its water resources from the shallow soil layers verweij et al 2011 ultimately our study demonstrated that the lack of deep soil water had limited capacity to influence the photochemical processes of apple trees presenting extraordinary physiological plasticity to cope under these conditions this has significant implications for long term ecosystem functioning under soil drying conditions in the face of climate change 4 3 theoretical insights and practical implications we provide a conceptual model for understanding how deep soil water deficit impacts photosynthesis during periods of drought in a dryland apple tree plantation fig 8 we demonstrated that deep soil water deficit increases water stress making ψ leaf more negative during drought at the same time k leaf decreases via a number of physiological mechanisms such as the destruction of leaf veins and regulation of cell membrane aquaporins zhang et al 2016 mcelrone et al 2007 in addition the release of the phytohormone abscisic acid under water stress induces stomatal closure yao et al 2021 decreasing a and e however we observed no significant effect of deep soil water deficit on the nonstomatal limitation of photosynthesis even during severe drought these findings reveal that apple trees could take advantage of shallow soil resources to maintain growth under drought our finding is significant for the gradual depletion of deep soil water wang et al 2011 jia et al 2019 wang et al 2023 with critical implications for carbon assimilation and vegetation dynamics in drylands under future climate change the nonstomatal limitation of the response of apple trees to deep soil water deficit warrants attention especially when soil water stress exceeds a critical swc threshold which may decrease nonstomatal limitation by damaging chlorophyll bhusal et al 2020 decreasing solar energy utilization galmes et al 2007 and rubisco activity parry et al 2002 and limiting rubp regeneration bota et al 2004 although the impact of deep soil water deficit on photosynthetic traits was surprisingly limited this study s results suggest that the decline in k leaf and ψ md shown no adjustment in response to the imposing deep soil water deficit even in the wet season indicating that the inability to access deep soil water during prolonged drought may result in hydraulic damage overall further studies are needed over longer timescales and considering the possible adaptation and physiological plasticity of trees if they cannot access deep soil resources in addition numerical modeling has promised an effective approach tree crown hydrodynamics model fetch3 is one such model that modelling the above and belowground water transport with a range of stem and root xylem hydraulic characteristics silva et al 2022 further efforts can incorporate fetch3 model to explore plant responses to water stress and xylem processes across the soil plant atmosphere continuum 5 conclusion understanding how deep soil water affects tree photosynthesis is essential for predicting the persistence and functioning of vegetation under future climate change in water limited ecosystems we explicitly quantified how deep soil water content limits leaf level photosynthesis in a 4 year experiment that partitioned the deep roots 200 cm of apple trees in a water limited ecosystem stomatal limitation of photosynthesis was more susceptible to deep soil water deficit in dry seasons effective recovery occurred in wet seasons in contrast nonstomatal limitation of photosynthesis in partitioned trees did not change in response to reduced deep soil water even during severe drought suggesting that trees adapt to environmental change through homeostatic regulation however more drastic changes in precipitation patterns or prolonged drought might negatively impact trees e g fruit yield and quality especially in species with low plasticity of hydraulic traits this study offers insights into the role of deep soil water in plant photosynthetic functions with significant implications for vegetation dynamics under climate change credit authorship contribution statement min yang

2347,montane ecoregions are important vehicles for downstream hydrologic function but their dynamics are relatively understudied compared to alpine and subalpine catchments in the western united states montane catchments experience shifts in precipitation inputs seasonally which results in spatiotemporal differences in source area contributions to the stream we collected hydrometric and geochemical data between 2018 and 2021 from a 2 65 km2 semi arid headwater catchment in the front range of colorado usa using a combined approach of hydrometric monitoring geochemical characterization and end member mixing analysis emma we assess hydrologic connectivity between areas with high upslope accumulation and the stream within our study area high upslope accumulation area corresponded to alluvial colluvial fans wherein we focused instrumentation and water sample collection using observed rainfall and multiyear measurements of groundwater levels soil moisture and streamflow we observed distinct hydrologic seasons within our catchment characterized by snowmelt during the spring rainstorms during the summer and a return to baseflow during the fall within this framework we found that source areas to streamflow shift with longitudinal distance downstream and among hydrologic seasons notably our emma results indicate that contributions from upstream source areas become less important than lateral inputs from spring snowmelt into the fall return to baseflow this was most pronounced at the upper catchment where upstream contributions to streamflow decreased up to 33 3 between spring and fall these results suggest that streamflow is maintained by local source areas contributing laterally and vertically our results reflect dynamic shifts in hydrologic connectivity in space and in time which are increasingly important to land and water resource management given rapid climate changes within the western united states keywords hydrologic connectivity end member mixing

hydroshare org resource f4edbcd9aec9490da06ff49297ad3932 1 introduction within united states us western montane regions headwater and non perennial streams play an important role in the delivery of water sediment and nutrients downstream and are vital to maintaining ecosystem health acuña et al 2014 buttle et al 2012 stubbington et al 2017 despite their importance catchments in these regions are relatively understudied compared to higher elevation alpine catchments with persistent snowpack because they contribute less downstream discharge per unit drainage area than high alpine regions hammond et al 2018 jacobs 2011 viviroli et al 2007 however lower elevation catchments cover a large area making our understanding of their cumulative contributions to downstream discharge important for water resource management harrison et al 2021 in particular in the western us lower elevation montane areas with intermittent snow persistence cover 25 of the land surface compared to alpine regions with high snow persistence 50 of time with snow on the ground between jan 1 and jul 3 which only constitute 13 of the land surface moore et al 2015 future climate projections of warming temperatures suggest that areas with high snow persistence will decline substantially in the coming decades with precipitation inputs shifting towards summer rain events rather than snowmelt klos et al 2014 headwater and non perennial stream systems are particularly sensitive to these climatic shifts as changes in precipitation inputs cause a decline in connectivity between the terrestrial landscape of a catchment and the stream channel decreasing streamflow permanence eng et al 2016 ward et al 2020 improving our understanding of spatial and temporal shifts in hydrologic connectivity in montane systems will become increasingly important both within the context of climate change in intermittent snow regions and in better predicting how catchment function in regions with high snow persistence may change in the future in many parts of the western us shifts from snowmelt to rainfall dominated flow regimes have already been observed fritze et al 2011 kampf lefsky 2016 a shift from snowmelt to rainfall inputs causes a change in water availability and temperature hunsaker et al 2012 vegetation and plant water use hu et al 2010 and subsurface water storage in soils and bedrock liu et al 2013 smith et al 2011 such changes can alter the paths by which water flows through a landscape hydrologic flow paths and is ultimately delivered to a stream hydrologic connectivity hinckley et al 2014 for example within alpine regions with high snow persistence hydrologic connectivity between the catchment and the stream is generated largely through the hydrologic flow paths of saturation overland flow and subsurface flow cowie et al 2017 kampf et al 2015 liu et al 2004 in montane regions with less snow accumulation and a shorter duration of snow cover saturation overland flow from the catchment to the stream is rare and lateral subsurface flow between the catchment and the stream may develop instead liu et al 2013 mcnamara et al 2005 however the spatiotemporal extent of hydrologic connectivity between the landscape and the stream through lateral subsurface flow is variable and depends on soil characteristics and precipitation inputs burns et al 2001 hinckley et al 2014 hydrologic connectivity is inherently dynamic in that connections or disconnections can occur seasonally godsey kirchner 2014 whiting godsey 2016 or episodically during rainfall or snowmelt pulses bracken croke 2007 jencso mcglynn 2011 stieglitz et al 2003 van meerveld et al 2015 hydrologic connectivity of a landscape to the stream can expand and contract as runoff source areas shift through space and time making it difficult to quantify consequently hydrologic connectivity is often inferred from either stream based or upland based measurements because direct observations are limited due to the difficulty in observing and quantifying surface and subsurface processes blume van meerveld 2015 hopp mcdonnell 2009 studies commonly use natural or applied tracers through end member mixing analysis emma to identify sources of water contributing to streamflow birch et al 2021 christophersen hooper 1992 hooper et al 1990 hooper shoemaker 1986 kiewiet et al 2020 sklash and farvolden 1979 and to assess connectivity of uplands to the stream tetzlaff et al 2015 uhlenbrook et al 2004 because stream chemistry is the proportional mixture of all actively contributing source areas within a catchment chemically quantifying each source area or end member allows for quantification of hydrologic connectivity between source areas within the catchment to the stream source areas that contribute to streamflow are controlled by heterogeneity in both the surface features e g topography vegetation and subsurface features e g regolith depth soil structure and warrant both hydrometric and geochemical characterization to determine hydrologic connectivity e g burns et al 2001 previous studies have measured upland stream connectivity using hydrometric measurements of the subsurface including topography soil moisture and quantification of the active drainage network d odorico and rigon 2003 jencso et al 2009 nippgen et al 2015 smith et al 2013 jencso et al 2009 closely monitored water table levels installed along the hillslope to riparian slopes within the tenderfoot creek experimental forest in the northern rocky mountains of montana and found that lateral upslope accumulating or contributing area was a first order control on runoff source area additional studies found that hydrologic connectivity is dependent upon antecedent moisture conditions as moisture decreases hillslope contributing areas become disconnected from the stream jencso et al 2009 smith et al 2013 nippgen et al 2015 and the proportion of the catchment area that is hydrologically connected to the stream decreases d odorico and rigon 2003 jencso et al 2009 smith et al 2013 nippgen et al 2011 nippgen et al 2015 further complicating the narrative some uplands have been found to rarely connect to the stream environment at all tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 while in some studies upland signals are dampened or altered by the riparian area near the stream mcglynn mcdonnell 2003 therefore pairing hydrometric responses with chemical characterizations of source areas ensure the physical plausibility of our end member mixing analysis and inferences of hydrologic connectivity quantifying hydrologic connectivity relies on the identification of dominant catchment runoff source areas which can be roughly described in three spatial dimensions lateral longitudinal and vertical nadeau rains 2007 zimmer mcglynn 2018 prior research on lateral hydrologic connectivity has largely been conducted within the context of the variable source area concept hewlett hibbert 1967 however few studies have focused on longitudinal godsey kirchner 2014 phillips et al 2011 zimmer mcglynn 2018 or vertical tague et al 2008 zimmer mcglynn 2017 zimmer mcglynn 2018 source areas of hydrologic connectivity and even fewer covino 2017 zimmer mcglynn 2018 have considered lateral longitudinal and vertical source areas of runoff in concert to better understand the spatiotemporal variability of streamflow dynamics in a lower elevation montane headwater system our study pairs geochemical characterization of catchment source areas with hydrometric measurements we targeted sample collection and measurements to address lateral longitudinal and vertical connectivity to a small headwater stream in the front range of colorado usa our holistic approach to quantifying source areas to the stream from differing landscape and topographic features is outlined in a conceptual diagram in fig 1 we address the following research questions 1 what are the dominant sources of streamflow in a small montane headwater stream and how do they shift in space and time and 2 how do landscape topographic features impact dominant source areas 2 methods 2 1 site description the manitou experimental forest mef is located within the traditional territories of the cheyenne and ute peoples in central colorado and has been managed as an experimental forest and range site by the united

convective afternoon thunderstorms characterized by brief but intense periods of rainfall and lightning additional precipitation occurs as snowfall from late september to may ortega et al 2014 snow cover is highly variable in space and time with persistent snowpack on north facing aspects of the catchment and discontinuous intermittent snow cover on south facing aspects spring snowmelt pulses can saturate the soil for days to weeks depending on aspect and weather conditions berkelhammer et al 2016 our study area is a 2 65 km2 catchment at the headwaters of hotel gulch within the mef boundaries fig 2 elevation ranges from 2626 m to 2843 m asl the study area is composed of subcatchments a and b corresponding to different reaches of the stream within hotel gulch hereon referred to as hotel stream and their respective drainage areas fig 2 catchment areas and stream lengths are given in table 1 reaches of hotel stream are non perennial drying out through the late summer months

connectivity between different source areas to hotel stream to better characterize longitudinal stream connectivity hotel stream was sampled along the longitudinal profiles of reach a non perennial

to just before the confluence with reach b a5 fig 2 sites are labeled based on distance from a0 such that sites with higher numbers indicate greater distance from a0 similarly sites along reach ab are labeled based on distance from the confluence of reaches a and b reach b was sampled from the most downstream observed persistent channelized flow b2 to target instrumentation towards areas with high

terrain analyses were completed using the whitebox tools plugin for arcgis pro lindsay 2016 sites a2 a3 a5 and ab3 were selected for further instrumentation based on uaa supplementary fig 1 these sites coincide with infrequently activated alluvial colluvial fans and are from hereon referred to as fans or fan sites fig 1 fan sites a3 a5 and ab3 are located on the drier south facing aspects while a2 is located on the wetter more densely vegetated north facing aspects of hotel gulch to characterize lateral and vertical connectivity of fan sites to hotel stream soil moisture sensors soil lysimeters and groundwater wells were installed to differing depths with increased lateral distance adjacent to the stream at each fan site soil moisture sensors and soil lysimeters were installed in the shallow subsurface 10 30 50 cm depths both adjacent to the stream and laterally distant from the stream within the fan fig 2 the belowground depth of the groundwater wells varies between 0 6 and 3

recorded every 5 min at the most upstream site a0 adjacent to each fan site a2 a3 a5 and ab3 and at the outlet of the non perennial reach b b2 using capacitance water level loggers odyssey dataflow

monitoring site in woodland park co approximately 13 km from the study area 2 3 2 groundwater to monitor lateral connectivity between the landscape and the stream we installed groundwater wells with increasing distance from the stream within the selected fan sites fig 1 each site has between 4 and 6 groundwater wells 3 to 4 on the fan side of the stream including one in the riparian zone within near stream riparian vegetation hereon referred to as riparian fan one within the fan but outside of the riparian zone lower fan and at least one further upland middle fan due to the larger size of the fan at site a3 we installed an additional fan well so there are four total wells within the fan at this site with the furthest labeled upper fan all fan sites have at least one groundwater well on the non fan side of the stream riparian non fan the lower fan sites ab3 and a5 have an additional non fan groundwater well installed outside of the riparian zone just beyond the toe slope break hillslope fig 1 due to rocky terrain and steep hillslopes we were unable to install hillslope wells at the upper fan sites groundwater wells installed on roughly south facing aspects are labeled s while those installed on roughly north facing aspects are labeled n wells are numbered according to distance from the stream such that well names ending in 1 were installed closest to the stream while those ending in 3 or 4 in the case of site a3 are furthest from the stream see fig 1 table 2 distances between groundwater wells and the stream vary at each fan site depending on the location of riparian vegetation and where subsurface saturation could be reached using a 4 6 m hand auger information on groundwater wells installed at each site can be found in table 2 all wells were screened over their entire length and were backfilled with washed sand and sealed at the surface with a thin layer of bentonite clay groundwater levels were recorded with a pressure transducer every 5 min in

early may through the end of october between 2018 and 2020 and monthly in 2021 stream sample sites between fan sites a1 a4 ab1 ab2 were sampled less frequently and mainly during the 2018 and 2019 study years certain sites remained frozen through spring and were the first to freeze in early fall a3 a5 b2 and were subsequently sampled less frequently portable automatic samplers were installed at select fan sites sites a3 a5 ab3 during the summer months of 2019 2020 and 2021 to automatically collect daily stream samples model 6712 teledyne isco lincoln ne usa 2 4 2 groundwater and soil water chemistry to better characterize hydrologic connectivity between the fans and the stream groundwater and soil water were collected approximately weekly from may through october between 2018 and 2020 and monthly in 2021 groundwater wells were purged with a bailer and allowed to recharge before sample collection to characterize soil water chemistry soil water lysimeters were installed adjacent to each soil moisture sensor nest fig 1 suction lysimeters prenart super quartz samplers and polypropylene collecting bottle vacuum containers were installed at 10 30 and 50 cm depths at riparian sites a2 a5 and ab3 riparian suction lysimeters were installed at 10 20 and 35 cm depths at site a3 due to the presence of the water table zero tension lysimeters were installed to capture preferential subsurface flow through the soil matrix at 10 cm at the site closest to the stream and at 10 and 30 cm at the site furthest from the stream zero tension lysimeters could not be installed deeper than 10 cm near the stream due to the presence of the water table zero tension lysimeters consisted of a small funnel filled with wash sand installed and backfilled within the soil profile connected to a tube and a 1 l hdpe collection bottle 2 5 chemical analysis stream soil water groundwater and precipitation samples were filtered through glass microfiber filters whatman glass microfiber filters grade gf f within 24 h of collection ion chromatography dionex aquion ion chromatography system was used to analyze all samples for major cations ca na mg k and major anions cl so4 no3 duplicates were analyzed on 10 of all samples to ensure precision and known standards and analytical blanks were run during each analysis to verify accuracy 2 5 from known values 2 6 analytical methods 2 6 1 hydrologic seasons to investigate potential drivers of temporal shifts in hydrologic connectivity between fans and hotel stream we analyzed observed precipitation data collected at the manitou experimental forest meteorological station located 5 km from the rain gage installed at site a3 of our study area given that hotel stream remains frozen from november through late april and most of our samples were collected from early summer to early fall we focused our precipitation analysis on 20 year observed rainfall data between may and october frank et al 2021 using average daily rainfall totals from the 20 years prior to our study we separated our analysis into three distinct hydrometric periods may to mid june approximate day of year doy 121 175 characterized by low intensity rainfall where streamflow is dominated by snowmelt mid july to mid august having sporadic high intensity rainfall inputs doy 176 223 and mid august through the end of october with little to no rainfall doy 224 305 fig 3 these periods roughly correspond to observed trends in streamflow in similar front range catchments where snowmelt causes high streamflow in the spring followed by a steady decrease in streamflow interrupted sporadically by summer thunderstorms and a return to baseflow in late summer to fall e g bukoski et al 2021 cowie et al 2017 therefore we focused our analysis on these three distinct hydrologic seasons melt out during spring wet up during summer rainstorms and a return to baseflow in fall 2 6 2 end member mixing analysis to identify source areas of longitudinal lateral and vertical stream connectivity the chemical dataset collected from hotel gulch was used in principal component analysis pca and emma following the methods of christophersen and hooper 1992 source areas or potential end members for each fan site considered in emma included stream water from the nearest longitudinally upstream stream site upstream a or upstream b groundwater collected with increasing lateral distance from the stream within the fan riparian fan lower fan middle fan upper fan or the non fan side of the stream riparian non fan or hillslope soil water collected from riparian suction lysimeters s or from riparian or fan zero tension lysimeters 0 tension emma was completed for all collected stream samples at each fan site following the methods of christophersen and hooper 1992 tracer selections and end member mixing scenarios were based on criteria adapted from christophersen and hooper 1992 while also incorporating the results of our hydrometric characterizations all analyses were performed using the r 4 2 0 statistical programming language r core team 2022 tracers were selected from the whole stream data set from solutes which were consistently found at detectable levels in streamflow cl f so4 mg ca na and k significant outliers were defined as any data point more than two standard deviations above or below the mean of the data and were removed from analysis to prevent outliers resulting from geochemical anomalies or analytical errors from having a disproportionate influence on results tracers were selected based on i ability to distinguish between end members ii maximation of the percent of variance in each stream dataset explained by the first two principal components pc1 pc2 and iii consistency with the conservative mixing hypothesis regarding the first criterion we tested if the mean concentrations of each solute were significantly different p 0 05 among at least one pair of potential end members using a tukey kramer test tukey hsd test in the agricolae r package for the second eigenvectors calculated in pca were summed to ensure the majority of variance was explained by pc1 and pc2 lastly we created bivariate scatter plots of solutes to ensure that those selected do not co vary in an apparent non linear fashion which would indicate non conservative mixing uptake or release we selected solutes with pearson s correlation r2 values 0 5 with p values 0 01 as tracers 2 6 3 stream chemistry and mixing models to characterize spatiotemporal shifts in stream water chemistry we generated mixing scenarios projected in principle component space corresponding to each fan site within each hydrologic season described above the stream water solute data set were standardized by centering them about their means and dividing them by their respective standard deviations standardizing stream chemistry data in this way ensures that solutes with the greatest variability do not have more influence on the mixing model principal component analysis pca was performed on each standardized stream dataset to determine the dimensionality or the rank order of the dataset the number of principal components retained in the mixing model was determined by plotting the eigenvectors for each rank order in a scree plot cattell 1966 within the scree plot smaller eigenvectors represent random variation in the dataset and tend to lie along a straight line the point where the first eigenvector departs from this line distinguishes the non random variation in principal components indicating the number of components or end members to retain 2 6 4 end member selection and relative contributions after the number of end members required for each mixing space was defined we examined the potential source areas within each fan site to assess their ability to explain the chemical composition of stream water for each hydrologic season end member concentrations were standardized by subtracting the means and dividing by the standard deviation of the stream observations end member concentrations were then projected into each mixing space by multiplying the standardized values by the matrix of retained eigenvectors from the stream pca for visual inspection of each potential mixing scenario end members were selected based on the following criteria i ability to effectively explain variation in stream chemistry such that all or most stream samples can be represented as a mixture of two or more end members and ii agreement with hydrometric data such that end members which do not appear hydrologically connected to the stream based on our hydrometric dataset do not represent stream connectivity with that source area to determine the relative proportions of stream runoff derived from retained end members hydrograph separations were completed on each stream solute dataset using the standard simultaneous equations for two equations 1 2 and three equations 3 5 end member mixing models with principal components one and two as tracers 1 f 1 p c s t r e a m 1 p c 2 1 p c 1 1 p c 2 1 2 f 2 1 f 1 3 f 1 p c s t r e a m 1 p c 3 1 p c 2 2 p c 3

f 1 f 2 where fx is the fractional contribution of end member x to streamflow and p c x i is principal component i of end member x in some cases stream observations happened to lie outside the mixing domain defined by the selected end members resulting in negative fractions of relative contributions liu et al 2004 in this case negative fractions were forced to zero and other contributions were assumed to be a mixture of the remaining end members only liu et al 2004 results of each end member mixing scenario were tested based on their ability to reproduce original stream solute values by multiplying end member fractions by the original mean end member solute concentrations mixing model fitness was quantified using simple linear regression between observed and back calculated stream solute concentrations with mixing model fitness as the coefficient of determination r2 between original and reproduced stream solute values 3 results 3 1 meteorological context compared to the 20 year average rainfall recorded between may and october at the mef headquarters meteorological station frank et al 2021 2021 was wetter than average and 2019 and 2020 were drier than average years fig 3 rainfall totals in 2021 were 135 of the 20 year may through october average while 2019 and 2020 were 71 and 69 of the 20 year average respectively table 3 the hotel gulch tipping bucket rain gage was not installed until 2019 so we do not have data comparisons between our study area and the 20 year rainfall record for 2018 however rainfall totals collected at the mef meteorological station data for 2018 were 77 of the 20 year rainfall record among each hydrologic season summer of 2021 had the highest rainfall totals followed by summer of 2019 2018 and 2020 spring rainfall was also highest during the 2021 study year followed by 2018 2020 and 2019 fall rainfall was highest in 2020 followed by 2018 2021 and 2019 table 4 snodas derived estimates of snow depth were lowest in 2018 with an estimated average depth of 164 mm and highest in 2021 with an estimated average depth of 456 mm snow depth was estimated at 383 mm in 2019 and 299 mm in 2020 snodas derived estimates of peak snow water equivalent swe averaged for the study area was 20 mm in 2018 55 mm in 2019 49 mm in 2020 and 64 mm in 2021 table 3 the 2021 study year received both more rain and had higher average swe making it a wetter than average year compared to the other study years 3 2 hydrometric response of fan sites 3 2 1 streamflow and precipitation streamflow varied among sites and study years site a5 exhibited frequent intermittency in streamflow particularly from late june july and august of 2020 making comparisons between streamflow and lateral contributions to the stream difficult to quantify at this site for this reason we focus the remainder of the lateral and vertical connectivity analysis on fan sites a2 a3 and ab3 observed trends in the hydrometric dataset were similar across all fan sites because of this data for site a3 are shown in fig 4 while data for sites a2 and ab3 are available in the supplementary material supplementary figs 2 3 across all sites the 2019 and 2020 study years had lower streamflow than that during 2021 this relationship between wet and dry years corresponded to the precipitation totals for each year with the lowest snowpack and rainfall totals measured in 2020 and highest in 2021 with 2019 rainfall totals falling between the two see table 3 and daily rainfall totals in fig 3 streamflow exhibited a similar pattern to the observed rainfall recorded at the mef headquarters meteorological tower with highest flows in spring and a continual decrease in flow with short interruptions from summer rainstorms fig 4 supplementary figs 2 3 streamflow was most responsive to the high intensity rainstorms occurring in late july to early august of 2020 and 2021 and prolonged rainfall occurring in early september of 2019 fig 4 daily average specific discharge discharge values recorded at each site divided by the site catchment area given in table 2 increased with increasing distance downstream gaining along reach a sites a2 a3 during the entire 2019 study period fig 5 during 2020 reach a switched from gaining to decreasing with increasing distance downstream losing between sites a2 and a3 on may 31st doy 151 and remained losing until the end of the study period in 2020 in 2021 reach a routinely switched from gaining to losing from early may through late june doy 181 but switched to losing from a2 to a3 during peaks in streamflow from june 24th doy 175 to august 13th doy 225 the stream was generally losing from reach a to reach ab except during the beginning of the 2020 study period when it was gaining from early may until the end of june doy 181 3 2 2 groundwater and soil moisture groundwater levels exhibited little response to rainfall inputs except for during the 2021 wet year fig 4 specifically all groundwater well levels increased during the high intensity rainstorms in late june and early august of 2021 with a higher response recorded in wells closer to the stream during this storm the largest fan response was recorded at site a3 with a3s2 and the lowest response was recorded at the furthest groundwater well at site a3s4 in general the non riparian groundwater wells installed within the uplands of the fans s2 s4 or n2 n3 were less responsive compared to the riparian groundwater wells s1 or n1 all groundwater levels exhibited a decline from spring to fall this decline was prominent at upland groundwater sites and groundwater levels at certain sites declined below the depths of our groundwater wells causing our wells to dry down at site a2 a2n3 dried down as early as june 24 2020 doy 175 a2n2 dried down starting on august 13 2020 doy 225 and september 12 2021 doy 255 supplementary fig 2 at site a3 a3s4 dried down on october 29 2020 doy 302 and a3s3 dried down starting on august 13 2020 doy 225 and october 22 2021 doy 295 fig 4 at all sites vwcriparian and vwcupland were most responsive during the 2021 study year within each site vwcriparian was generally higher across all depths compared to vwcupland at any depths across all sites and all depths vwcriparian ranged between 5 and 80 with site a2 having the lowest values recorded at 10 and 30 cm depths across all sites the deepest vwcriparian depth remained relatively constant ranging between 40 and 50 vwcupland across all sites and depths ranged from 0 to 30 with driest conditions measured at site a2 and wettest conditions measured at site a3 as with groundwater levels we observed a decline in vwc across all sites and depths at both upland and riparian positions fig 4 supplementary figs 2 3 3 3 geochemical response 3 3 1 stream chemistry stream solute concentrations did not appear to be influenced by shifts in gaining losing discharge dynamics along the longitudinal stream profile during any of the study years fig 5 rather stream solute concentrations appear to shift on a seasonal scale temporal variation in stream solute concentrations of mg na and ca exhibited a pattern of decreased concentrations likely from snowmelt during the spring followed by increased concentrations during the summer months fig 5 for example ca concentrations increased 6 0 mg l 1 at sites a2 and a3 and 3 0 mg l 1 at ab3 with values starting at roughly 13 0 mg l 1 in spring conversely stream solute concentrations of cl k and so4 exhibited increased concentrations in the spring with either decreased or relatively constant concentrations during the summer months depending on the site fig 5 at sites a2 and a3 cl k and so4 concentrations decreased from spring to summer and returned approximately to spring concentrations during the fall however at site ab3 concentrations varied between study years and temporal patterns were more difficult to discern for example cl generally decreased from roughly 1 2 to 0 8 mg l 1 in 2019 and 2021 but fluctuated between 1 3 and 1 0 mg l 1 in 2020 f was generally less variable than other solutes varying between roughly 2 2 and 2 5 mg l 1 across sites and seasons solute concentrations aggregated across all study years varied along the longitudinal stream profile generally increasing with increased distance from the headwater fig 6 supplementary table 1 compared to reach a reach b had higher concentrations of all solutes except for na which did not have a distinguishable longitudinal pattern as a mixture of reaches a and b reach ab had the second highest concentrations for all solutes certain solutes exhibited distinct differences among hydrologic seasons fig 6 supplementary table 1 this was particularly pronounced when comparing spring against summer and fall hydrologic seasons with higher spring concentrations for so4 and cl and lower concentrations for k f mg ca and na 3 3 2 groundwater and soil water chemistry groundwater and soil water solute concentrations varied with distance from the stream depth and hydrologic season across sites supplementary tables 2 4 groundwater concentrations of mg na ca k and so4 generally increased with increasing distance from the stream for each site this was particularly pronounced during the fall at site a3 mean stream so4 concentration was 4 8 mg l 1 while mean upper fan groundwater was 15 3 mg l 1 riparian fan groundwater concentrations of mg na and ca were generally lower than that of the stream across all seasons in addition all solutes except for na where higher in the non fan riparian groundwater compared to the riparian fan groundwater this was most pronounced at site a2 during the fall season where mean ca concentration was 37 higher in riparian non fan groundwater compared to riparian fan groundwater generally soil solute concentrations were highest at the deepest riparian suction lysimeter depth the highest mean soil solute concentration was measured during the fall from 50 cm at site a2 notably mean ca was 44 5 mg l 1 mean mg was 6 4 mg l 1 and mean na was 10 5 mg l 1 soil water collected using zero tension lysimeters was generally more dilute compared to the suction soil water supplementary tables 2 4 this dilution likely reflects infiltration of precipitation with short contact time with the soil 3 4 end member mixing analysis 3 4 1 stream water chemistry and selection of stream tracers tracers were selected by applying the previously described criteria to the whole stream data set across all hydrologic seasons bivariate plots of major stream solutes revealed significant relationships r2 0 5 p 0 01 for k mg f and so4 for reach a and mg cl and so4 for reach ab making them suitable tracers for analysis sodium na appeared to be an important tracer for reach ab given our thresholds for significance but was not selected due to its apparent non linear behavior exhibited in supplementary fig 4 the selection of k and f as tracers for stream reach a is consistent with those suggested by gregory et al 2022 for the hotel gulch study area selected tracers were used across each hydrologic season for each site 3 4 2 selection and nature of end members an independent mixing space dimensionality analysis was performed for each stream water geochemical dataset associated with each hydrologic season fig 7 of the nine spatiotemporal scenarios analyzed five required two end member mixing scenarios and the remaining four required three end member mixing scenarios the spring hydrologic season required two end members for every site all hydrologic seasons required two end member mixing scenarios at site ab3 the range in percent variance explained by the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 for the two end member mixing scenarios ranged from 85 to 97 while that for three end member mixing scenarios ranged from 90 to 95 when projected into principal component pc space stream samples at all sites during the spring season were best explained by a mixture of upstream a chemistry and one groundwater source non fan riparian upper fan and riparian fan for sites a2 a3 and ab3 respectively this agrees with our hydrometric data as groundwater well levels are highest during spring melt out fig 3 during the summer season stream samples at a2 were best explained by a mixture of riparian suction lysimeter soil water riparian soil s at 50 cm riparian non fan groundwater and upstream a chemistry at site a3 stream chemistry was best explained by upstream a riparian non fan groundwater and riparian soil s at 35 cm moving downstream to site ab3 stream chemistry was best explained by upstream a and lower fan groundwater chemistry the inclusion of riparian soil s at 50 cm for site a2 and 35 cm for site a3 aligns with our hydrometric measurements of soil moisture as vwcriparian at these depths remains saturated at each site across all study years fig 3 supplementary fig 2 in addition our hydrometric data confirm that the riparian non fan groundwater wells at sites a2 and a3 remain hydrologically active throughout each summer despite appearing to best explain the stream mixing scenario in pc space the middle fan groundwater well at site a2 dries down during the late summer months of each study year supplementary fig 2 and therefore was not selected as an end member lastly during the fall season the stream chemistry is best defined by upstream a riparian soil s at 50 cm and riparian soil s at 30 cm for site a2 upstream a lower fan groundwater and riparian fan groundwater at site a3 and upstream b and lower fan groundwater at site ab3 as during the summer season the inclusion of riparian soil at 30 and 50 cm for site a2 and 35 cm for site a3 aligns with our observation of continued saturation at these depths 3 4 3 relative proportion of contributions across space and hydrologic seasons contributions from upstream chemistry were highest during the spring season and lowest during the fall season for each site the majority of groundwater contributions across all spatiotemporal mixing scenarios were from the lower fan riparian fan and riparian non fan groundwater wells at site ab3 riparian fan groundwater and lower fan groundwater chemistry contributed to approximately half of the stream chemistry for each season at site a3 riparian non fan groundwater contributed to 22 of the stream chemistry during the summer and the lower fan groundwater contributed to 42 9 of the stream chemistry during the fall at site a2 riparian non fan groundwater contributed to 17 3 of the stream chemistry in the spring and 19 7 during the summer the only exception occurred at site a3 during the spring season where upper fan groundwater contributed 21 9 of the stream chemistry sites a2 and a3 appear to become disconnected from groundwater further from the stream and more connected to riparian source areas through time surprisingly upstream b does not contribute chemically to site ab3 until the fall season 3 4 4 evaluation of emma results r2 values between observed and back calculated stream solute concentrations were variable ranging from 0 10 to 0 99 with the majority of slopes near one table 5 instances where slopes strayed from unity between observed and back calculated concentrations indicate that the models may lead to over or under prediction of the observed concentrations of certain solutes slopes furthest from unity were found at site a2 during the fall season with 5 02 for mg and 0 11 for k r2 values were particularly weak 0 2 during the fall season at sites a2 and a3 for tracers mg f and k and during the summer at site a2 for k 4 discussion using a combined approach of hydrometric monitoring and end member mixing analysis we assessed hydrologic connectivity of a small headwater catchment within the colorado front range focusing on alluvial colluvial fans corresponding to areas with high upslope accumulation area uaa we characterized the geochemistry and hydrometric responses of source areas contributing to streamflow in three dimensions lateral longitudinal and vertical the results of our hydrometric characterizations of soil moisture and ground water levels fig 4 supplementary figs 2 3 and emma fig 7 indicate that source areas to the stream shift in space and time in this montane headwater catchment we found that the longitudinal signal from upstream sites became less important than lateral contributions among our defined hydrologic seasons of spring summer and fall 4 1 lateral longitudinal and vertical source areas to the stream shift with distance downstream and between hydrologic seasons the main contributors to site specific local streamflow were upstream surface water and local groundwater the majority of lateral source areas between the fan sites and hotel stream ranged from shallow subsurface riparian soil pore water collected between 30 and 50 cm riparian groundwater fan and non fan ranging from 0 7 to 1 2 m belowground and lower fan groundwater ranging from 1 2 to 1 9 m belowground each of these source areas ranged only between 5 and 20 m laterally from the stream table 2 one exception occurred during the spring hydrologic season with groundwater contributions from the deepest groundwater well at site a3 a3s4 which was installed 3 8 m belowground and 59 6 m laterally from the stream at each site the relative contributions from the upstream end member decreased from spring to summer and fall hydrologic seasons this was particularly pronounced at the upper catchment sites a2 and a3 upstream contributions to streamflow declined 17 7 from spring to fall at site a2 and 33 3 at site a3 at site ab3 upstream contributions to streamflow only declined slightly between hydrologic season but shifted in which upstream reach was the major contributor 51 3 contributions from upstream a in spring to 48 8 contributions from upstream b in the fall this switch between contributions from upstream a in the spring and summer to upstream b during fall was unexpected given the intermittency of surface flow in reach b however this result aligns with our geochemical characterization along the longitudinal stream profile with site ab3 becoming more chemically similar to reach b for most solutes during fall months fig 6 conceptually our results indicate that the greatest contribution to longitudinal streamflow is generated during spring snowmelt at the headwaters of the catchment as represented by the upstream chemical signature in our emma results fig 7 we propose a conceptual model of the observed seasonal changes in dominant streamflow contributions within this montane headwater catchment fig 8 our hydrometric characterization of groundwater and soil moisture levels indicated that as the system shifts from the start of the spring hydrologic season early season to the end of the fall hydrologic season late season catchment wetness and groundwater levels decline from early to late season upstream source areas become less important to sustaining streamflow of downstream reaches and lateral contributions from groundwater and soil water adjacent to the stream become more important to sustaining streamflow fig 8 these findings are significant given the small size of hotel stream the maximum specific discharge we observed at the three study sites was 0 03 mm hr 1 measured during the spring hydrologic season in the case of site ab3 an 50 relative contribution from laterally connected groundwater would provide a substantial source of water to the stream particularly as the overall moisture content of the catchment decreases into the fall hydrologic season therefore connection to local groundwater source areas at the reach level become increasingly important to maintaining streamflow through time 4 2 lateral upslope accumulation areas are important source areas to the stream but to what extent we anticipated and our results supported that landscape units with high lateral uaa would be a first order control to stream connectivity as found in jencso et al 2009 and bergstrom et al 2016 these findings are consistent with the foundational hillslope hydrology studies that found a connection between uaa or contributing area and the accumulation of subsurface flow e g anderson burt 1978 beven kirkby 1979 dunne black 1970 harr 1977 hewlett hibbert 1967 during the spring hydrologic season in particular we expected the highest proportion of the catchment to be hydrologically active as a result of snowmelt saturating soils and increasing groundwater levels bergstrom et al 2016 bukoski et al 2021 harrison et al 2021 jencso et al 2009 mcnamara et al 2005 nippgen et al 2015 by extension we expected hydrologic connectivity between the most laterally distant upland portions of the alluvial colluvial fans and the stream during snowmelt in the tenderfoot creek experimental forest in central montana usa for example bergstrom et al 2016 found a strong relationship between lateral contributing area and gross gains in streamflow however our geochemical characterizations of groundwater and soil water indicate that upland fan source areas were not a major contributor to stream chemistry the lack of connection between the furthest upland portions of the fan sites and the stream is consistent with the findings of gregory et al 2022 within hotel gulch comparisons of stream and soil molar ratios of major cations and anions suggested a lack of connection between soils from non riparian landscape units and the stream our findings combined with gregory et al 2022 may also be indicative of contributions from deeper flow paths as in hornberger et al 1998 due to the relatively shallow depths of our groundwater wells we likely were only able to capture the activation of such deeper flow paths at our deepest groundwater well a3s4 during spring snowmelt fig 7 further characterizing these deep groundwater flowpaths would allow for a more insightful analysis of subsurface contributions to streamflow but is beyond the scope of this study at the upper fan sites a2 and a3 the deepest and furthest source area appeared to be hydrologically connected to the stream during the spring fig 7 with a shift to shallow riparian contributions as the catchment dried down into the summer fig 4 supplementary fig 2 previous studies have found similar patterns in connectivity as overall catchment moisture and streamflow declines contributing area becomes a less important control of streamflow and connectivity is limited to near stream source areas bergstrom et al 2016 kiewiet et al 2020 nippgen et al 2015 payn et al 2012 smith et al 2013 smith et al 2013 found that only approximately 5 of the stream network was hydrologically connected to the catchment through shallow subsurface flow during periods of low flow similarly nippgen et al 2015 found that simulated connected area expanded from areas parallel and close to the stream during low flow conditions to upland hillslopes during high flow conditions while our results indicate a lack of prolonged connectivity between the most upland source areas and the stream our emma results indicate substantial and sustained lateral stream contributions up to approximately 20 m 4 3 implications for montane headwater systems understanding the sources and timing of water delivery to streams is a fundamental topic in hydrologic research while topographic features and landscape processes are unique to each study including the alluvial colluvial fans in this work our findings provide valuable insight into the spatiotemporal shifts of dominant source areas to streamflow understanding the dynamic nature of active and connected source areas within a catchment is critical to understanding shifts in downstream water quantity and quality with impacts for water resource management as well as ecosystem services and ecosystem health acuña et al 2014 buttle et al 2012 stubbington et al 2017 for example pacific et al 2010 found that the transport of dissolved organic carbon doc to the stream network was highly dependent on the connectivity of specific source areas with high doc concentrations in addition disturbances like anthropogenic land use change and wildfire have been shown to impact downstream water quality e g bolstad and swank 1997 clinton vose 2006 gardner et al 2011 murphy et al 2018 the upper south platte river basin where our study was conducted is both a highly fire prone and erosive landscape graham 2003 prior to 2020 the upper south platte was the site of the largest fire in colorado history hayman fire now ranked 4th largest wildfire can also alter runoff processes causing shifts in subsurface flow and impacting the quantity and quality of water delivered from uplands to streams ebel et al 2012 moody and ebel 2014 within the context of this study if climate variability or disturbance were to disrupt the subsurface flow between laterally connected groundwater for example the streamflow could decrease up to 50 negatively impacting downstream ecosystem health 4 4 limitations of the study we used emma to elucidate patterns in source area stream contributions from a multiyear stream chemistry dataset and across hydrological seasons in doing so we were able to examine shifts in source area contributions under a variety of spatiotemporal conditions however as with all studies utilizing emma our results are limited by our degree of success in accurately characterizing the geochemistry of all potential end members and the conservative behavior of the tracers used burns et al 2001 tracers used for each emma model were screened for non conservative behavior and bivariate solutes plots revealed linear relationships for reach a and reach ab tracers r2 0 5 p value 0 01 additionally each tracer selected was approximately normally distributed shapiro wilk p value 0 05 improving the robustness of each mixing scenario however selected tracers at certain sites and during certain hydrologic seasons were less successful in reproducing observed fluctuations in stream chemistry poor mixing model fitness table 5 we attribute poor mixing model fitness to the fact that the same tracer selection procedure was carried out and applied to all hydrologic seasons and to both reach a sites a single tracer selection was based on the whole stream chemistry data set for sites a2 and a3 however using a single tracer selection was necessary for comparisons between end members and relative contributions among mixing scenarios along each stream reach we chose to evaluate reach ab separately from reach a due to inputs from non perennial stream b fig 2 as a result mixing model fitness was generally improved at site ab3 compared to a2 and a3 because the same tracers were applied across all hydrologic seasons certain tracers still did not perform as well during some seasons compared to others e g mg during summer at site ab3 this was observed across all sites and hydrologic seasons we attribute this to the selected tracers reflecting connectivity to a specific source area of the catchment e g pacific et al 2010 through different hydrologic seasons rather than to catchment wide connectivity across all seasons 5 conclusions streamflow sources across hydrologic seasons were characterized in a 2 65 km2 semi arid montane headwater catchment we used a combined approach of hydrometric monitoring geochemical characterization and end member mixing analysis to assess hydrologic connectivity of the catchment with high upslope accumulation area uaa the areas with highest uaa corresponded to alluvial colluvial fans wherein we focused instrumentation and water sample collection to address lateral longitudinal and vertical connectivity between the landscape and the stream we used observed rainfall trends to determine hydrologic seasons spanning from may through october reflecting different conditions with respect to stream discharge soil moisture and groundwater levels using end member mixing analysis we found that source areas to streamflow shifted in space in time with contributions from upstream sites becoming less important than lateral contributions between spring summer and fall hydrologic seasons our results indicate dynamic shifts in hydrologic connectivity in

2347,montane ecoregions are important vehicles for downstream hydrologic function but their dynamics are relatively understudied compared to alpine and subalpine catchments in the western united states montane catchments experience shifts in precipitation inputs seasonally which results in spatiotemporal differences in source area contributions to the stream we collected hydrometric and geochemical data between 2018 and 2021 from a 2 65 km2 semi arid headwater catchment in the front range of colorado usa using a combined approach of hydrometric monitoring geochemical characterization and end member mixing analysis emma we assess hydrologic connectivity between areas with high upslope accumulation and the stream within our study area high upslope accumulation area corresponded to alluvial colluvial fans wherein we focused instrumentation and water sample collection using observed rainfall and multiyear measurements of groundwater levels soil moisture and streamflow we observed distinct hydrologic seasons within our catchment characterized by snowmelt during the spring rainstorms during the summer and a return to baseflow during the fall within this framework we found that source areas to streamflow shift with longitudinal distance downstream and among hydrologic seasons notably our emma results indicate that contributions from upstream source areas become less important than lateral inputs from spring snowmelt into the fall return to baseflow this was most pronounced at the upper catchment where upstream contributions to streamflow decreased up to 33 3 between spring and fall these results suggest that streamflow is maintained by local source areas contributing laterally and vertically our results reflect dynamic shifts in hydrologic connectivity in

hydroshare org resource f4edbcd9aec9490da06ff49297ad3932 1 introduction within united states us western montane regions headwater and non perennial streams play an important role in the delivery of water sediment and nutrients downstream and are vital to maintaining ecosystem health acuña et al 2014 buttle et al 2012 stubbington et al 2017 despite their importance catchments in these regions are relatively understudied compared to higher elevation alpine catchments with persistent snowpack because they contribute less downstream discharge per unit drainage area than high alpine regions hammond et al 2018 jacobs 2011 viviroli et al 2007 however lower elevation catchments cover a large area making our understanding of their cumulative contributions to downstream discharge important for water resource management harrison et al 2021 in particular in the western us lower elevation montane areas with intermittent snow persistence cover 25 of the land surface compared to alpine regions with high snow persistence 50 of time with snow on the ground between jan 1 and jul 3 which only constitute 13 of the land surface moore et al 2015 future climate projections of warming temperatures suggest that areas with high snow persistence will decline substantially in the coming decades with precipitation inputs shifting towards summer rain events rather than snowmelt klos et al 2014 headwater and non perennial stream systems are particularly sensitive to these climatic shifts as changes in precipitation inputs cause a decline in connectivity between the terrestrial landscape of a catchment and the stream channel decreasing streamflow permanence eng et al 2016 ward et al 2020 improving our understanding of spatial and temporal shifts in hydrologic connectivity in montane systems will become increasingly important both within the context of climate change in intermittent snow regions and in better predicting how catchment function in regions with high snow persistence may change in the future in many parts of the western us shifts from snowmelt to rainfall dominated flow regimes have already been observed fritze et al 2011 kampf lefsky 2016 a shift from snowmelt to rainfall inputs causes a change in water availability and temperature hunsaker et al 2012 vegetation and plant water use hu et al 2010 and subsurface water storage in soils and bedrock liu et al 2013 smith et al 2011 such changes can alter the paths by which water flows through a landscape hydrologic flow paths and is ultimately delivered to a stream hydrologic connectivity hinckley et al 2014 for example within alpine regions with high snow persistence hydrologic connectivity between the catchment and the stream is generated largely through the hydrologic flow paths of saturation overland flow and subsurface flow cowie et al 2017 kampf et al 2015 liu et al 2004 in montane regions with less snow accumulation and a shorter duration of snow cover saturation overland flow from the catchment to the stream is rare and lateral subsurface flow between the catchment and the stream may develop instead liu et al 2013 mcnamara et al 2005 however the spatiotemporal extent of hydrologic connectivity between the landscape and the stream through lateral subsurface flow is variable and depends on soil characteristics and precipitation inputs burns et al 2001 hinckley et al 2014 hydrologic connectivity is inherently dynamic in that connections or disconnections can occur seasonally godsey kirchner 2014 whiting godsey 2016 or episodically during rainfall or snowmelt pulses bracken croke 2007 jencso mcglynn 2011 stieglitz et al 2003 van meerveld et al 2015 hydrologic connectivity of a landscape to the stream can expand and contract as runoff source areas shift through space and time making it difficult to quantify consequently hydrologic connectivity is often inferred from either stream based or upland based measurements because direct observations are limited due to the difficulty in observing and quantifying surface and subsurface processes blume van meerveld 2015 hopp mcdonnell 2009 studies commonly use natural or applied tracers through end member mixing analysis emma to identify sources of water contributing to streamflow birch et al 2021 christophersen hooper 1992 hooper et al 1990 hooper shoemaker 1986 kiewiet et al 2020 sklash and farvolden 1979 and to assess connectivity of uplands to the stream tetzlaff et al 2015 uhlenbrook et al 2004 because stream chemistry is the proportional mixture of all actively contributing source areas within a catchment chemically quantifying each source area or end member allows for quantification of hydrologic connectivity between source areas within the catchment to the stream source areas that contribute to streamflow are controlled by heterogeneity in both the surface features e g topography vegetation and subsurface features e g regolith depth soil structure and warrant both hydrometric and geochemical characterization to determine hydrologic connectivity e g burns et al 2001 previous studies have measured upland stream connectivity using hydrometric measurements of the subsurface including topography soil moisture and quantification of the active drainage network d odorico and rigon 2003 jencso et al 2009 nippgen et al 2015 smith et al 2013 jencso et al 2009 closely monitored water table levels installed along the hillslope to riparian slopes within the tenderfoot creek experimental forest in the northern rocky mountains of montana and found that lateral upslope accumulating or contributing area was a first order control on runoff source area additional studies found that hydrologic connectivity is dependent upon antecedent moisture conditions as moisture decreases hillslope contributing areas become disconnected from the stream jencso et al 2009 smith et al 2013 nippgen et al 2015 and the proportion of the catchment area that is hydrologically connected to the stream decreases d odorico and rigon 2003 jencso et al 2009 smith et al 2013 nippgen et al 2011 nippgen et al 2015 further complicating the narrative some uplands have been found to rarely connect to the stream environment at all tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 while in some studies upland signals are dampened or altered by the riparian area near the stream mcglynn mcdonnell 2003 therefore pairing hydrometric responses with chemical characterizations of source areas ensure the physical plausibility of our end member mixing analysis and inferences of hydrologic connectivity quantifying hydrologic connectivity relies on the identification of dominant catchment runoff source areas which can be roughly described in three spatial dimensions lateral longitudinal and vertical nadeau rains 2007 zimmer mcglynn 2018 prior research on lateral hydrologic connectivity has largely been conducted within the context of the variable source area concept hewlett hibbert 1967 however few studies have focused on longitudinal godsey kirchner 2014 phillips et al 2011 zimmer mcglynn 2018 or vertical tague et al 2008 zimmer mcglynn 2017 zimmer mcglynn 2018 source areas of hydrologic connectivity and even fewer covino 2017 zimmer mcglynn 2018 have considered lateral longitudinal and vertical source areas of runoff in concert to better understand the spatiotemporal variability of streamflow dynamics in a lower elevation montane headwater system our study pairs geochemical characterization of catchment source areas with hydrometric measurements we targeted sample collection and measurements to address lateral longitudinal and vertical connectivity to a small headwater stream in the front range of colorado usa our holistic approach to quantifying source areas to the stream from differing landscape and topographic features is outlined in a conceptual diagram in fig 1 we address the following research questions 1 what are the dominant sources of streamflow in a small montane headwater stream and how do they shift in space and time and 2 how do landscape topographic features impact dominant source areas 2 methods 2 1 site description the manitou experimental forest mef is located within the traditional territories of the cheyenne and ute peoples in central colorado and has been managed as an experimental forest and range site by the united states department of agriculture usda forest service s rocky mountain research station since 1936 located 48 km northwest of colorado springs the mef covers 67 km2 or roughly 2 6 of the upper south

convective afternoon thunderstorms characterized by brief but intense periods of rainfall and lightning additional precipitation occurs as snowfall from late september to may ortega et al 2014 snow cover is highly variable in space and time with persistent snowpack on north facing aspects of the catchment and discontinuous intermittent snow cover on south facing aspects spring snowmelt pulses can saturate the soil for days to weeks depending on aspect and weather conditions berkelhammer et al 2016 our study area is a 2 65 km2 catchment at the headwaters of hotel gulch within the mef boundaries fig 2 elevation ranges from 2626 m to 2843 m asl the study area is composed of subcatchments a and b corresponding to different reaches of the stream within hotel gulch hereon referred to as hotel stream and their respective drainage areas fig 2 catchment areas and stream lengths are given in table 1 reaches of hotel stream are non perennial drying out through the late summer months

connectivity between different source areas to hotel stream to better characterize longitudinal stream connectivity hotel stream was sampled along the longitudinal profiles of reach a non perennial reach b and reach ab downstream of the confluence between reaches a and b reach a was sampled from the most upstream site of observed persistent channelized flow along the main stem of hotel stream a0 to just before the confluence with reach b a5 fig 2 sites are labeled based on distance from a0 such that sites with higher numbers indicate greater distance from a0 similarly sites along reach ab are labeled based on distance from the confluence of reaches a and b reach b was sampled from the most downstream observed persistent channelized flow b2 to target instrumentation towards areas with high lateral inputs to hotel stream upslope accumulation area uaa was calculated using 1 m resolution airborne laser swath mapping alsm data of our study area courtesy of the national center for airborne laser mapping ncalm rossi et al 2022 we used the triangular multiple flow direction algorithm md infinity method developed by seibert mcglynn 2007 to calculate flow accumulation for our study area terrain analyses were completed using the whitebox tools plugin for arcgis pro lindsay 2016 sites a2 a3 a5 and ab3 were selected for further instrumentation based on uaa supplementary fig 1 these sites coincide with infrequently activated alluvial colluvial fans and are from hereon referred to as fans or fan sites fig 1 fan sites a3 a5 and ab3 are located on the drier south facing aspects while a2 is located on the wetter more densely vegetated north facing aspects of hotel gulch to characterize lateral and vertical connectivity of fan sites to hotel stream soil moisture sensors soil lysimeters and groundwater wells were installed to differing depths with increased lateral distance adjacent to the stream at each fan site soil moisture sensors and soil lysimeters were installed in the shallow subsurface 10 30 50 cm depths both adjacent to the stream and laterally distant from the stream within the fan fig 2 the belowground depth of the groundwater wells varies between 0 6 and 3 7 m with the shallowest groundwater wells nearest to the stream and the deepest wells furthest from the stream 2 3 hydrometric measurements 2 3 1 streamflow and precipitation stream stage data were recorded every 5 min at the most upstream site a0 adjacent to each fan site a2 a3 a5 and ab3 and at the outlet of the non perennial reach b b2 using capacitance water level loggers odyssey dataflow

national operational hydrologic remote sensing center nohrs snowfall totals for each year were obtained from the community collaborative rain hail and snow network cocorahs reges et al 2016 from a monitoring site in woodland park co approximately 13 km from the study area 2 3 2 groundwater to monitor lateral connectivity between the landscape and the stream we installed groundwater wells with increasing distance from the stream within the selected fan sites fig 1 each site has between 4 and 6 groundwater wells 3 to 4 on the fan side of the stream including one in the riparian zone within near stream riparian vegetation hereon referred to as riparian fan one within the fan but outside of the riparian zone lower fan and at least one further upland middle fan due to the larger size of the fan at site a3 we installed an additional fan well so there are four total wells within the fan at this site with the furthest labeled upper fan all fan sites have at least one groundwater well on the non fan side of the stream riparian non fan the lower fan sites ab3 and a5 have an additional non fan groundwater well installed outside of the riparian zone just beyond the toe slope break hillslope fig 1 due to rocky terrain and steep hillslopes we were unable to install hillslope wells at the upper fan sites groundwater wells installed on roughly south facing aspects are labeled s while those installed on roughly north facing aspects are labeled n wells are numbered according to distance from the stream such that well names ending in 1 were installed closest to the stream while those ending in 3 or 4 in the case of site a3 are furthest from the stream see fig 1 table 2 distances between groundwater wells and the stream vary at each fan site depending on the location of riparian vegetation and where subsurface saturation could be reached using a 4 6 m hand auger information on groundwater wells installed at each site can be found in table 2 all wells were screened over their entire length and were backfilled with washed sand and sealed at the surface with a thin layer of bentonite clay groundwater levels were recorded with a pressure transducer every 5 min in riparian wells for all study years and at all wells during the 2020 and 2021 field seasons onset hobo u20l 04 water level data logger the logger for a2n3 was damaged during the winter of 2020 and was not deployed during the 2021 study season groundwater levels remained below the depth of our groundwater well at ab3s3 resulting in no level data for that site and the logger was subsequently removed

vwcriparian and at the groundwater well furthest from the stream on the fan side of the stream at each site vwcupland fig 1 at sites a2 a3 a5 and ab3 vwcriparian and vwcupland sensors were installed at 10 30 and 50 cm depths except for vwcriparian at site a3 where the sensors were installed at 10 20 and 35 cm depths due to the presence of the water table at 50 cm acclima tdt sensors can resolve 0

early may through the end of october between 2018 and 2020 and monthly in 2021 stream sample sites between fan sites a1 a4 ab1 ab2 were sampled less frequently and mainly during the 2018 and 2019 study years certain sites remained frozen through spring and were the first to freeze in early fall a3 a5 b2 and were subsequently sampled less frequently portable automatic samplers were installed at select fan sites sites a3 a5 ab3 during the summer months of 2019 2020 and 2021 to automatically collect daily stream samples model 6712 teledyne isco lincoln ne usa 2 4 2 groundwater and soil water chemistry to better characterize hydrologic connectivity between the fans and the stream groundwater and soil water were collected approximately weekly from may through october between 2018 and 2020 and monthly in 2021 groundwater wells were purged with a bailer and allowed to recharge before sample collection to characterize soil water chemistry soil water lysimeters were installed adjacent to each soil moisture sensor nest fig 1 suction lysimeters prenart super quartz samplers and polypropylene collecting bottle vacuum containers were installed at 10 30 and 50 cm depths at riparian sites a2 a5 and ab3 riparian suction lysimeters were installed at 10 20 and 35 cm depths at site a3 due to the presence of the water table zero tension lysimeters were installed to capture preferential subsurface flow through the soil matrix at 10 cm at the site closest to the stream and at 10 and 30 cm at the site furthest from the stream zero tension lysimeters could not be installed deeper than 10 cm near the stream due to the presence of the water table zero tension lysimeters consisted of a small funnel filled with wash sand installed and backfilled within the soil profile connected to a tube and a 1 l hdpe collection bottle 2 5 chemical analysis stream soil water groundwater and precipitation samples were filtered through glass microfiber filters whatman glass microfiber filters grade gf f within 24 h of collection ion chromatography dionex aquion ion chromatography system was used to analyze all samples for major cations ca na mg k and major anions cl so4 no3 duplicates were analyzed on 10 of all samples to ensure precision and known standards and analytical blanks were run during each analysis to verify accuracy 2 5 from known values 2 6 analytical methods 2 6 1 hydrologic seasons to investigate potential drivers of temporal shifts in hydrologic connectivity between fans and hotel stream we analyzed observed precipitation data collected at the manitou experimental forest meteorological station located 5 km from the rain gage installed at site a3 of our study area given that hotel stream remains frozen from november through late april and most of our samples were collected from early summer to early fall we focused our precipitation analysis on 20 year observed rainfall data between may and october frank et al 2021 using average daily rainfall totals from the 20 years prior to our study we separated our analysis into three distinct hydrometric periods may to mid june approximate day of year doy 121 175 characterized by low intensity rainfall where streamflow is dominated by snowmelt mid july to mid august having sporadic high intensity rainfall inputs doy 176 223 and mid august through the end of october with little to no rainfall doy 224 305 fig 3 these periods roughly correspond to observed trends in streamflow in similar front range catchments where snowmelt causes high streamflow in the spring followed by a steady decrease in streamflow interrupted sporadically by summer thunderstorms and a return to baseflow in late summer to fall e g bukoski et al 2021 cowie et al 2017 therefore we focused our analysis on these three distinct hydrologic seasons melt out during spring wet up during summer rainstorms and a return to baseflow in fall 2 6 2 end member mixing analysis to identify source areas of longitudinal lateral and vertical stream connectivity the chemical dataset collected from hotel gulch was used in principal component analysis pca and emma following the methods of christophersen and hooper 1992 source areas or potential end members for each fan site considered in emma included stream water from the nearest longitudinally upstream stream site upstream a or upstream b groundwater collected with increasing lateral distance from the stream within the fan riparian fan lower fan middle fan upper fan or the non fan side of the stream riparian non fan or hillslope soil water collected from riparian suction lysimeters s or from riparian or fan zero tension lysimeters 0 tension emma was completed for all collected stream samples at each fan site following the methods of christophersen and hooper 1992 tracer selections and end member mixing scenarios were based on criteria adapted from christophersen and hooper 1992 while also incorporating the results of our hydrometric characterizations all analyses were performed using the r 4 2 0 statistical programming language r core team 2022 tracers were selected from the whole stream data set from solutes which were consistently found at detectable levels in streamflow cl f so4 mg ca na and k significant outliers were defined as any data point more than two standard deviations above or below the mean of the data and were removed from analysis to prevent outliers resulting from geochemical anomalies or analytical errors from having a disproportionate influence on results tracers were selected based on i ability to distinguish between end members ii maximation of the percent of variance in each stream dataset explained by the first two principal components pc1 pc2 and iii consistency with the conservative mixing hypothesis regarding the first criterion we tested if the mean concentrations of each solute were significantly different p 0 05 among at least one pair of potential end members using a tukey kramer test tukey hsd test in the agricolae r package for the second eigenvectors calculated in pca were summed to ensure the majority of variance was explained by pc1 and pc2 lastly we created bivariate scatter plots of solutes to ensure that those selected do not co vary in an apparent non linear fashion which would indicate non conservative mixing uptake or release we selected solutes with pearson s correlation r2 values 0 5 with p values 0 01 as tracers 2 6 3 stream chemistry and mixing models to characterize spatiotemporal shifts in stream water chemistry we generated mixing scenarios projected in principle component space corresponding to each fan site within each hydrologic season described above the stream water solute data set were standardized by centering them about their means and dividing them by their respective standard deviations standardizing stream chemistry data in this way ensures that solutes with the greatest variability do not have more influence on the mixing model principal component analysis pca was performed on each standardized stream dataset to determine the dimensionality or the rank order of the dataset the number of principal components retained in the mixing model was determined by plotting the eigenvectors for each rank order in a scree plot cattell 1966 within the scree plot smaller eigenvectors represent random variation in the dataset and tend to lie along a straight line the point where the first eigenvector departs from this line distinguishes the non random variation in principal components indicating the number of components or end members to retain 2 6 4 end member selection and relative contributions after the number of end members required for each mixing space was defined we examined the potential source areas within each fan site to assess their ability to explain the chemical composition of stream water for each hydrologic season end member concentrations were standardized by subtracting the means and dividing by the standard deviation of the stream observations end member concentrations were then projected into each mixing space by multiplying the standardized values by the matrix of retained eigenvectors from the stream pca for visual inspection of each potential mixing scenario end members were selected based on the following criteria i ability to effectively explain variation in stream chemistry such that all or most stream samples can be represented as a mixture of two or more end members and ii agreement with hydrometric data such that end members which do not appear hydrologically connected to the stream based on our hydrometric dataset do not represent stream connectivity with that source area to determine the relative proportions of stream runoff derived from retained end members hydrograph separations were completed on each stream solute dataset using the standard simultaneous equations for two equations 1 2 and three equations 3 5 end member mixing models with principal components one and two as tracers 1 f 1 p c s t r e a m 1 p c 2 1 p c 1 1 p c 2 1 2 f 2 1 f 1 3 f 1 p c s t r e a m 1 p c 3 1 p c 2 2 p c 3

f 1 f 2 where fx is the fractional contribution of end member x to streamflow and p c x i is principal component i of end member x in some cases stream observations happened to lie outside the mixing domain defined by the selected end members resulting in negative fractions of relative contributions liu et al 2004 in this case negative fractions were forced to zero and other contributions were assumed to be a mixture of the remaining end members only liu et al 2004 results of each end member mixing scenario were tested based on their ability to reproduce original stream solute values by multiplying end member fractions by the original mean end member solute concentrations mixing model fitness was quantified using simple linear regression between observed and back calculated stream solute concentrations with mixing model fitness as the coefficient of determination r2 between original and reproduced stream solute values 3 results 3 1 meteorological context compared to the 20 year average rainfall recorded between may and october at the mef headquarters meteorological station frank et al 2021 2021 was wetter than average and 2019 and 2020 were drier than average years fig 3 rainfall totals in 2021 were 135 of the 20 year may through october average while 2019 and 2020 were 71 and 69 of the 20 year average respectively table 3 the hotel gulch tipping bucket rain gage was not installed until 2019 so we do not have data comparisons between our study area and the 20 year rainfall record for 2018 however rainfall totals collected at the mef meteorological station data for 2018 were 77 of the 20 year rainfall record among each hydrologic season summer of 2021 had the highest rainfall totals followed by summer of 2019 2018 and 2020 spring rainfall was also highest during the 2021 study year followed by 2018 2020 and 2019 fall rainfall was highest in 2020 followed by 2018 2021 and 2019 table 4 snodas derived estimates of snow depth were lowest in 2018 with an estimated average depth of 164 mm and highest in 2021 with an estimated average depth of 456 mm snow depth was estimated at 383 mm in 2019 and 299 mm in 2020 snodas derived estimates of peak snow water equivalent swe averaged for the study area was 20 mm in 2018 55 mm in 2019 49 mm in 2020 and 64 mm in 2021 table 3 the 2021 study year received both more rain and had higher average swe making it a wetter than average year compared to the other study years 3 2 hydrometric response of fan sites 3 2 1 streamflow and precipitation streamflow varied among sites and study years site a5 exhibited frequent intermittency in streamflow particularly from late june july and august of 2020 making comparisons between streamflow and lateral contributions to the stream difficult to quantify at this site for this reason we focus the remainder of the lateral and vertical connectivity analysis on fan sites a2 a3 and ab3 observed trends in the hydrometric dataset were similar across all fan sites because of this data for site a3 are shown in fig 4 while data for sites a2 and ab3 are available in the supplementary material supplementary figs 2 3 across all sites the 2019 and 2020 study years had lower streamflow than that during 2021 this relationship between wet and dry years corresponded to the precipitation totals for each year with the lowest snowpack and rainfall totals measured in 2020 and highest in 2021 with 2019 rainfall totals falling between the two see table 3 and daily rainfall totals in fig 3 streamflow exhibited a similar pattern to the observed rainfall recorded at the mef headquarters meteorological tower with highest flows in spring and a continual decrease in flow with short interruptions from summer rainstorms fig 4 supplementary figs 2 3 streamflow was most responsive to the high intensity rainstorms occurring in late july to early august of 2020 and 2021 and prolonged rainfall occurring in early september of 2019 fig 4 daily average specific discharge discharge values recorded at each site divided by the site catchment area given in table 2 increased with increasing distance downstream gaining along reach a sites a2 a3 during the entire 2019 study period fig 5 during 2020 reach a switched from gaining to decreasing with increasing distance downstream losing between sites a2 and a3 on may 31st doy 151 and remained losing until the end of the study period in 2020 in 2021 reach a routinely switched from gaining to losing from early may through late june doy 181 but switched to losing from a2 to a3 during peaks in streamflow from june 24th doy 175 to august 13th doy 225 the stream was generally losing from reach a to reach ab except during the beginning of the 2020 study period when it was gaining from early may until the end of june doy 181 3 2 2 groundwater and soil moisture groundwater levels exhibited little response to rainfall inputs except for during the 2021 wet year fig 4 specifically all groundwater well levels increased during the high intensity rainstorms in late june and early august of 2021 with a higher response recorded in wells closer to the stream during this storm the largest fan response was recorded at site a3 with a3s2 and the lowest response was recorded at the furthest groundwater well at site a3s4 in general the non riparian groundwater wells installed within the uplands of the fans s2 s4 or n2 n3 were less responsive compared to the riparian groundwater wells s1 or n1 all groundwater levels exhibited a decline from spring to fall this decline was prominent at upland groundwater sites and groundwater levels at certain sites declined below the depths of our groundwater wells causing our wells to dry down at site a2 a2n3 dried down as early as june 24 2020 doy 175 a2n2 dried down starting on august 13 2020 doy 225 and september 12 2021 doy 255 supplementary fig 2 at site a3 a3s4 dried down on october 29 2020 doy 302 and a3s3 dried down starting on august 13 2020 doy 225 and october 22 2021 doy 295 fig 4 at all sites vwcriparian and vwcupland were most responsive during the 2021 study year within each site vwcriparian was generally higher across all depths compared to vwcupland at any depths across all sites and all depths vwcriparian ranged between 5 and 80 with site a2 having the lowest values recorded at 10 and 30 cm depths across all sites the deepest vwcriparian depth remained relatively constant ranging between 40 and 50 vwcupland across all sites and depths ranged from 0 to 30 with driest conditions measured at site a2 and wettest conditions measured at site a3 as with groundwater levels we observed a decline in vwc across all sites and depths at both upland and riparian positions fig 4 supplementary figs 2 3 3 3 geochemical response 3 3 1 stream chemistry stream solute concentrations did not appear to be influenced by shifts in gaining losing discharge dynamics along the longitudinal stream profile during any of the study years fig 5 rather stream solute concentrations appear to shift on a seasonal scale temporal variation in stream solute concentrations of mg na and ca exhibited a pattern of decreased concentrations likely from snowmelt during the spring followed by increased concentrations during the summer months fig 5 for example ca concentrations increased 6 0 mg l 1 at sites a2 and a3 and 3 0 mg l 1 at ab3 with values starting at roughly 13 0 mg l 1 in spring conversely stream solute concentrations of cl k and so4 exhibited increased concentrations in the spring with either decreased or relatively constant concentrations during the summer months depending on the site fig 5 at sites a2 and a3 cl k and so4 concentrations decreased from spring to summer and returned approximately to spring concentrations during the fall however at site ab3 concentrations varied between study years and temporal patterns were more difficult to discern for example cl generally decreased from roughly 1 2 to 0 8 mg l 1 in 2019 and 2021 but fluctuated between 1 3 and 1 0 mg l 1 in 2020 f was generally less variable than other solutes varying between roughly 2 2 and 2 5 mg l 1 across sites and seasons solute concentrations aggregated across all study years varied along the longitudinal stream profile generally increasing with increased distance from the headwater fig 6 supplementary table 1 compared to reach a reach b had higher concentrations of all solutes except for na which did not have a distinguishable longitudinal pattern as a mixture of reaches a and b reach ab had the second highest concentrations for all solutes certain solutes exhibited distinct differences among hydrologic seasons fig 6 supplementary table 1 this was particularly pronounced when comparing spring against summer and fall hydrologic seasons with higher spring concentrations for so4 and cl and lower concentrations for k f mg ca and na 3 3 2 groundwater and soil water chemistry groundwater and soil water solute concentrations varied with distance from the stream depth and hydrologic season across sites supplementary tables 2 4 groundwater concentrations of mg na ca k and so4 generally increased with increasing distance from the stream for each site this was particularly pronounced during the fall at site a3 mean stream so4 concentration was 4 8 mg l 1 while mean upper fan groundwater was 15 3 mg l 1 riparian fan groundwater concentrations of mg na and ca were generally lower than that of the stream across all seasons in addition all solutes except for na where higher in the non fan riparian groundwater compared to the riparian fan groundwater this was most pronounced at site a2 during the fall season where mean ca concentration was 37 higher in riparian non fan groundwater compared to riparian fan groundwater generally soil solute concentrations were highest at the deepest riparian suction lysimeter depth the highest mean soil solute concentration was measured during the fall from 50 cm at site a2 notably mean ca was 44 5 mg l 1 mean mg was 6 4 mg l 1 and mean na was 10 5 mg l 1 soil water collected using zero tension lysimeters was generally more dilute compared to the suction soil water supplementary tables 2 4 this dilution likely reflects infiltration of precipitation with short contact time with the soil 3 4 end member mixing analysis 3 4 1 stream water chemistry and selection of stream tracers tracers were selected by applying the previously described criteria to the whole stream data set across all hydrologic seasons bivariate plots of major stream solutes revealed significant relationships r2 0 5 p 0 01 for k mg f and so4 for reach a and mg cl and so4 for reach ab making them suitable tracers for analysis sodium na appeared to be an important tracer for reach ab given our thresholds for significance but was not selected due to its apparent non linear behavior exhibited in supplementary fig 4 the selection of k and f as tracers for stream reach a is consistent with those suggested by gregory et al 2022 for the hotel gulch study area selected tracers were used across each hydrologic season for each site 3 4 2 selection and nature of end members an independent mixing space dimensionality analysis was performed for each stream water geochemical dataset associated with each hydrologic season fig 7 of the nine spatiotemporal scenarios analyzed five required two end member mixing scenarios and the remaining four required three end member mixing scenarios the spring hydrologic season required two end members for every site all hydrologic seasons required two end member mixing scenarios at site ab3 the range in percent variance explained by the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 for the two end member mixing scenarios ranged from 85 to 97 while that for three end member mixing scenarios ranged from 90 to 95 when projected into principal component pc space stream samples at all sites during the spring season were best explained by a mixture of upstream a chemistry and one groundwater source non fan riparian upper fan and riparian fan for sites a2 a3 and ab3 respectively this agrees with our hydrometric data as groundwater well levels are highest during spring melt out fig 3 during the summer season stream samples at a2 were best explained by a mixture of riparian suction lysimeter soil water riparian soil s at 50 cm riparian non fan groundwater and upstream a chemistry at site a3 stream chemistry was best explained by upstream a riparian non fan groundwater and riparian soil s at 35 cm moving downstream to site ab3 stream chemistry was best explained by upstream a and lower fan groundwater chemistry the inclusion of riparian soil s at 50 cm for site a2 and 35 cm for site a3 aligns with our hydrometric measurements of soil moisture as vwcriparian at these depths remains saturated at each site across all study years fig 3 supplementary fig 2 in addition our hydrometric data confirm that the riparian non fan groundwater wells at sites a2 and a3 remain hydrologically active throughout each summer despite appearing to best explain the stream mixing scenario in pc space the middle fan groundwater well at site a2 dries down during the late summer months of each study year supplementary fig 2 and therefore was not selected as an end member lastly during the fall season the stream chemistry is best defined by upstream a riparian soil s at 50 cm and riparian soil s at 30 cm for site a2 upstream a lower fan groundwater and riparian fan groundwater at site a3 and upstream b and lower fan groundwater at site ab3 as during the summer season the inclusion of riparian soil at 30 and 50 cm for site a2 and 35 cm for site a3 aligns with our observation of continued saturation at these depths 3 4 3 relative proportion of contributions across space and hydrologic seasons contributions from upstream chemistry were highest during the spring season and lowest during the fall season for each site the majority of groundwater contributions across all spatiotemporal mixing scenarios were from the lower fan riparian fan and riparian non fan groundwater wells at site ab3 riparian fan groundwater and lower fan groundwater chemistry contributed to approximately half of the stream chemistry for each season at site a3 riparian non fan groundwater contributed to 22 of the stream chemistry during the summer and the lower fan groundwater contributed to 42 9 of the stream chemistry during the fall at site a2 riparian non fan groundwater contributed to 17 3 of the stream chemistry in the spring and 19 7 during the summer the only exception occurred at site a3 during the spring season where upper fan groundwater contributed 21 9 of the stream chemistry sites a2 and a3 appear to become disconnected from groundwater further from the stream and more connected to riparian source areas through time surprisingly upstream b does not contribute chemically to site ab3 until the fall season 3 4 4 evaluation of emma results r2 values between observed and back calculated stream solute concentrations were variable ranging from 0 10 to 0 99 with the majority of slopes near one table 5 instances where slopes strayed from unity between observed and back calculated concentrations indicate that the models may lead to over or under prediction of the observed concentrations of certain solutes slopes furthest from unity were found at site a2 during the fall season with 5 02 for mg and 0 11 for k r2 values were particularly weak 0 2 during the fall season at sites a2 and a3 for tracers mg f and k and during the summer at site a2 for k 4 discussion using a combined approach of hydrometric monitoring and end member mixing analysis we assessed hydrologic connectivity of a small headwater catchment within the colorado front range focusing on alluvial colluvial fans corresponding to areas with high upslope accumulation area uaa we characterized the geochemistry and hydrometric responses of source areas contributing to streamflow in three dimensions lateral longitudinal and vertical the results of our hydrometric characterizations of soil moisture and ground water levels fig 4 supplementary figs 2 3 and emma fig 7 indicate that source areas to the stream shift in space and time in this montane headwater catchment we found that the longitudinal signal from upstream sites became less important than lateral contributions among our defined hydrologic seasons of spring summer and fall 4 1 lateral longitudinal and vertical source areas to the stream shift with distance downstream and between hydrologic seasons the main contributors to site specific local streamflow were upstream surface water and local groundwater the majority of lateral source areas between the fan sites and hotel stream ranged from shallow subsurface riparian soil pore water collected between 30 and 50 cm riparian groundwater fan and non fan ranging from 0 7 to 1 2 m belowground and lower fan groundwater ranging from 1 2 to 1 9 m belowground each of these source areas ranged only between 5 and 20 m laterally from the stream table 2 one exception occurred during the spring hydrologic season with groundwater contributions from the deepest groundwater well at site a3 a3s4 which was installed 3 8 m belowground and 59 6 m laterally from the stream at each site the relative contributions from the upstream end member decreased from spring to summer and fall hydrologic seasons this was particularly pronounced at the upper catchment sites a2 and a3 upstream contributions to streamflow declined 17 7 from spring to fall at site a2 and 33 3 at site a3 at site ab3 upstream contributions to streamflow only declined slightly between hydrologic season but shifted in which upstream reach was the major contributor 51 3 contributions from upstream a in spring to 48 8 contributions from upstream b in the fall this switch between contributions from upstream a in the spring and summer to upstream b during fall was unexpected given the intermittency of surface flow in reach b however this result aligns with our geochemical characterization along the longitudinal stream profile with site ab3 becoming more chemically similar to reach b for most solutes during fall months fig 6 conceptually our results indicate that the greatest contribution to longitudinal streamflow is generated during spring snowmelt at the headwaters of the catchment as represented by the upstream chemical signature in our emma results fig 7 we propose a conceptual model of the observed seasonal changes in dominant streamflow contributions within this montane headwater catchment fig 8 our hydrometric characterization of groundwater and soil moisture levels indicated that as the system shifts from the start of the spring hydrologic season early season to the end of the fall hydrologic season late season catchment wetness and groundwater levels decline from early to late season upstream source areas become less important to sustaining streamflow of downstream reaches and lateral contributions from groundwater and soil water adjacent to the stream become more important to sustaining streamflow fig 8 these findings are significant given the small size of hotel stream the maximum specific discharge we observed at the three study sites was 0 03 mm hr 1 measured during the spring hydrologic season in the case of site ab3 an 50 relative contribution from laterally connected groundwater would provide a substantial source of water to the stream particularly as the overall moisture content of the catchment decreases into the fall hydrologic season therefore connection to local groundwater source areas at the reach level become increasingly important to maintaining streamflow through time 4 2 lateral upslope accumulation areas are important source areas to the stream but to what extent we anticipated and our results supported that landscape units with high lateral uaa would be a first order control to stream connectivity as found in jencso et al 2009 and bergstrom et al 2016 these findings are consistent with the foundational hillslope hydrology studies that found a connection between uaa or contributing area and the accumulation of subsurface flow e g anderson burt 1978 beven kirkby 1979 dunne black 1970 harr 1977 hewlett hibbert 1967 during the spring hydrologic season in particular we expected the highest proportion of the catchment to be hydrologically active as a result of snowmelt saturating soils and increasing groundwater levels bergstrom et al 2016 bukoski et al 2021 harrison et al 2021 jencso et al 2009 mcnamara et al 2005 nippgen et al 2015 by extension we expected hydrologic connectivity between the most laterally distant upland portions of the alluvial colluvial fans and the stream during snowmelt in the tenderfoot creek experimental forest in central montana usa for example bergstrom et al 2016 found a strong relationship between lateral contributing area and gross gains in streamflow however our geochemical characterizations of groundwater and soil water indicate that upland fan source areas were not a major contributor to stream chemistry the lack of connection between the furthest upland portions of the fan sites and the stream is consistent with the findings of gregory et al 2022 within hotel gulch comparisons of stream and soil molar ratios of major cations and anions suggested a lack of connection between soils from non riparian landscape units and the stream our findings combined with gregory et al 2022 may also be indicative of contributions from deeper flow paths as in hornberger et al 1998 due to the relatively shallow depths of our groundwater wells we likely were only able to capture the activation of such deeper flow paths at our deepest groundwater well a3s4 during spring snowmelt fig 7 further characterizing these deep groundwater flowpaths would allow for a more insightful analysis of subsurface contributions to streamflow but is beyond the scope of this study at the upper fan sites a2 and a3 the deepest and furthest source area appeared to be hydrologically connected to the stream during the spring fig 7 with a shift to shallow riparian contributions as the catchment dried down into the summer fig 4 supplementary fig 2 previous studies have found similar patterns in connectivity as overall catchment moisture and streamflow declines contributing area becomes a less important control of streamflow and connectivity is limited to near stream source areas bergstrom et al 2016 kiewiet et al 2020 nippgen et al 2015 payn et al 2012 smith et al 2013 smith et al 2013 found that only approximately 5 of the stream network was hydrologically connected to the catchment through shallow subsurface flow during periods of low flow similarly nippgen et al 2015 found that simulated connected area expanded from areas parallel and close to the stream during low flow conditions to upland hillslopes during high flow conditions while our results indicate a lack of prolonged connectivity between the most upland source areas and the stream our emma results indicate substantial and sustained lateral stream contributions up to approximately 20 m 4 3 implications for montane headwater systems understanding the sources and timing of water delivery to streams is a fundamental topic in hydrologic research while topographic features and landscape processes are unique to each study including the alluvial colluvial fans in this work our findings provide valuable insight into the spatiotemporal shifts of dominant source areas to streamflow understanding the dynamic nature of active and connected source areas within a catchment is critical to understanding shifts in downstream water quantity and quality with impacts for water resource management as well as ecosystem services and ecosystem health acuña et al 2014 buttle et al 2012 stubbington et al 2017 for example pacific et al 2010 found that the transport of dissolved organic carbon doc to the stream network was highly dependent on the connectivity of specific source areas with high doc concentrations in addition disturbances like anthropogenic land use change and wildfire have been shown to impact downstream water quality e g bolstad and swank 1997 clinton vose 2006 gardner et al 2011 murphy et al 2018 the upper south platte river basin where our study was conducted is both a highly fire prone and erosive landscape graham 2003 prior to 2020 the upper south platte was the site of the largest fire in colorado history hayman fire now ranked 4th largest wildfire can also alter runoff processes causing shifts in subsurface flow and impacting the quantity and quality of water delivered from uplands to streams ebel et al 2012 moody and ebel 2014 within the context of this study if climate variability or disturbance were to disrupt the subsurface flow between laterally connected groundwater for example the streamflow could decrease up to 50 negatively impacting downstream ecosystem health 4 4 limitations of the study we used emma to elucidate patterns in source area stream contributions from a multiyear stream chemistry dataset and across hydrological seasons in doing so we were able to examine shifts in source area contributions under a variety of spatiotemporal conditions however as with all studies utilizing emma our results are limited by our degree of success in accurately characterizing the geochemistry of all potential end members and the conservative behavior of the tracers used burns et al 2001 tracers used for each emma model were screened for non conservative behavior and bivariate solutes plots revealed linear relationships for reach a and reach ab tracers r2 0 5 p value 0 01 additionally each tracer selected was approximately normally distributed shapiro wilk p value 0 05 improving the robustness of each mixing scenario however selected tracers at certain sites and during certain hydrologic seasons were less successful in reproducing observed fluctuations in stream chemistry poor mixing model fitness table 5 we attribute poor mixing model fitness to the fact that the same tracer selection procedure was carried out and applied to all hydrologic seasons and to both reach a sites a single tracer selection was based on the whole stream chemistry data set for sites a2 and a3 however using a single tracer selection was necessary for comparisons between end members and relative contributions among mixing scenarios along each stream reach we chose to evaluate reach ab separately from reach a due to inputs from non perennial stream b fig 2 as a result mixing model fitness was generally improved at site ab3 compared to a2 and a3 because the same tracers were applied across all hydrologic seasons certain tracers still did not perform as well during some seasons compared to others e g mg during summer at site ab3 this was observed across all sites and hydrologic seasons we attribute this to the selected tracers reflecting connectivity to a specific source area of the catchment e g pacific et al 2010 through different hydrologic seasons rather than to catchment wide connectivity across all seasons 5 conclusions streamflow sources across hydrologic seasons were characterized in a 2 65 km2 semi arid montane headwater catchment we used a combined approach of hydrometric monitoring geochemical characterization and end member mixing analysis to assess hydrologic connectivity of the catchment with high upslope accumulation area uaa the areas with highest uaa corresponded to alluvial colluvial fans wherein we focused instrumentation and water sample collection to address lateral longitudinal and vertical connectivity between the landscape and the stream we used observed rainfall trends to determine hydrologic seasons spanning from may through october reflecting different conditions with respect to stream discharge soil moisture and groundwater levels using end member mixing analysis we found that source areas to streamflow shifted in space in time with contributions from upstream sites becoming less important than lateral contributions between spring summer and fall hydrologic seasons our results indicate dynamic shifts in hydrologic connectivity in space and in time which are increasingly important to land and water resource management within the western united states credit authorship contribution statement sidney a bush conceptualization

2348,overuse of water resources has led to serious ecological degradation in most river basins however there is little processed based understanding of the dynamic feedback between management decisions from different sectors in river basins and their resultant socio economic and ecological outcomes this study developed a socio hydrological model to track the evolution of water used for socio economic and ecological uses and to simulate the response of water resource allocation and water environmental regulations to the resulting economic and ecological outcomes it was applied in the maipo river basin chile from 1990 to 2019 the results show that this model successfully simulated water resources allocation and water environmental regulations over time water environmental regulations showed a strongly linear responsive behaviour to observed accumulated ecological degradation results also show that the observed decrease in water resource allocation for economic uses was influenced by increasing agricultural economic benefits and accumulated ecological degradation it is suggested that environmental regulations should be stronger synchronized and coordinated with water resources allocation decisions to revert the increasing ecological degradation this socio hydrological model with revision into different contexts could be used to assess integrated water resources and water environmental management in other river basins keywords socio hydrology water resources management water resources allocation water regulations environmental regulations data availability

elshafei et al 2015 grantham et al 2014 pahl wostl 2015 sanderson et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 river basins are basic components of the earth system which represent the logical management units of water

implications newson 2008 integrated water resource management iwrm has been widely implemented by government agencies academics and ngos for several decades in which the coordinated development and management of water land and other related resources are promoted in order to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems global water partnership 2000 while there exist extensive studies on qualitative assessment of iwrm in which a lot of indicators for example accountability transparency legitimacy public participation justice efficiency and an absence of corruption are often used de stefano 2010 hooper 2008 pahl wostl et al 2010 few of studies on the processed based understanding of the dynamic feedback between management decisions of different sectors and their resultant socio economic and ecological outcomes have been found which is considered as the root cause of very limited success in iwrm molle 2008 pahl wostl 2015 socio hydrological models have been developed to simulate bidirectional feedbacks between the society and water systems to explain unintended consequences that appear from water resources management di baldassarre et al 2019 pande and sivapalan 2017 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 a range of unintended consequences emerging from lack of understanding of bidirectional feedbacks have been studied including the flood adaptation and the levee effect ciullo et al 2017 di baldassarre et al 2019 the drought mitigation garcia et al 2016 gonzales and ajami 2017 the aggregative effect where undesirable outcomes at the system scale arise from aggregated individual decisions di baldassarre et al 2019 the pendulum swing where water resources management shifts from an economic water allocation to the natural environment chen et al 2016 elshafei et al 2015 elshafei et al 2014 kandasamy et al 2014 van emmerik et al 2014 these studies have often incorporated for example the environmental awareness a function of environmental degradation as the social variables without being directly calibrated with social data chen et al 2016 elshafei et al 2015 elshafei et al 2014 roobavannan et al 2018 van emmerik et al 2014 therefore despite of these advances in socio hydrology models there are no recognized methods for representing and quantifying the social component and explicitly incorporating it into these models di baldassarre et al 2019 roobavannan et al 2018 water resources management agencies and environmental protection agencies are major sectors for water management decisions in river basins the former has the primary objective to achieve an efficient water resources allocation to maximize the economic benefits without compromising the sustainability of the riverine ecological system which is the recent goal for some river basins and the latter often revises existing or issues new water environmental regulations to maintain the ecological systems at river basin and influence water resources allocation through restrictions and norms that regulate water extractions in addition there may exist delays between governance decisions and their resultant ecological outcomes therefore understanding the dynamic feedback between the management decisions of these two sectors and their resultant unintended and undesirable socio economic and ecological outcomes is required to develop integrated water resources and water environment management this paper aims to develop a socio hydrological model for assessing water resources allocation and water environmental regulations and their response to the resulting economic and ecological outcomes for improving integrated water resources and water environment management at river basins the maipo river basin located in central chile is chosen as the case study as water management in chile is globally recognised the expected outputs from this study will be a novel method to quantitively simulate the feedback from the changing socio economic and ecological outcomes to water resources allocation and water environmental regulations in which the social component water environmental regulations was independently quantified and calibrated 2 methods 2 1 case study description the maipo river basin located in central chile is home to santiago city covering almost the entire

loss of habitat cnr 2016 conama rm 2010 the prolongated drought experienced in this region have resulted in a significant reduction of water availability groundwater levels mean river discharges and a negative impact in water quality consequently affecting aquatic terrestrial and coastal ecosystems garreaud et al 2020 peña guerrero et al 2020 vicuña et al 2018 moreover it is expected that climate change will further negatively affect the study basin garreaud et al 2020 meza et al 2014 results from díaz et al 2019 conclude that an increase in the degradation of the maipo river is expected in the near future water resources in chile are managed by several independent agencies at the local regional and national levels each with its own responsibilities world bank 2013 the general water directorate is a body of the state responsible for water resources management at the national level and its equivalates at other levels the ministry of environment is responsible for issuing environmental regulations either for the whole country or some specific regions peña 2018 poor communication and coordination between water environmental protection agencies and water resources management agencies are highly recognised in major river basins e g the maipo river basin and often resulted in undesired ecological outcomes cnr 2016 oecd 2011 oecd 2012 universidad de chile 2019 world bank 2013 therefore the maipo river basin is an ideal case for the purpose of this study 2 2 model formulation a socio hydrological conceptual model for simulating the feedback from economic and ecological outcomes to the water resources allocation and water environmental regulations in the maipo river basin was developed based on recent advances in socio hydrological model lu et al 2018 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 and site specific characteristics in the case area fig 2 the model consists of four main components representing the coupling socio ecological systems they are i water environmental regulations ii water resources allocation water use for socio economic purposes and for ecological purposes iii economic outcomes associated with all the productive uses of water representing the producer s surplus subject to total water availability productivity efficiency costs and the price of products and iv ecological outcomes expressed as the accumulated ecological degradation as ecological issues worsen when they persist in time a typical slow variable relative to change in economic system and hydrological system the external drivers of this model include climatic conditions population land use pattern water rights and technological advances for example irrigation methods which directly affect water resource allocation and both economic and ecological outcomes it is hypothesized that the annual water resource allocation is influenced by the water environmental regulations and feedback of both observed socio economic outcomes and ecological outcomes it is also hypothesized that water environment regulations revision or issuing new items are mainly influenced by the feedback of observed ecological outcomes the environmental regulations may be affected by the national economic situation but our previous study has found that nation wide water environmental regulations had a strong positive correlation with the national economic growth gdp genova alonso et al 2022 thus they were not included in this study to implement this conceptual model in the maipo river basin the spatial domain included three sub catchments of the maipo river basin mapocho bajo basin maipo medio basin and maipo bajo basin highlighted in fig 1 the model considered a monthly water resources allocation water uses while the economic outcomes ecological outcomes water environmental regulation and all the feedbacks considered as an annual time step the study encompassed a time scale of 30 years between 1990 and 2019 we chose this timeframe as the significant ecological degradation and environmental regulations started only after the 1990s the methods for estimating each model component and the feedback loops in fig 2 are formulated in the following sections 2 3 catchment water balance the monthly water balance was developed for each sub catchment considering the existing interconnections between them the flow from the upper sub basin maipo alto contributes to mapocho bajo and maipo medio sub catchments a fraction of the outflow from the alto maipo is diverted by the san carlos canal an artificial canal to supply the high urban and agricultural water demand in the mapocho bajo sub catchment the total water from maipo alto to mapocho bajo was estimated considering a distribution factor subject to the maximum capacity of the san carlos canal based on dga 2015 the remaining flow from maipo alto naturally contributes to the maipo medio finally maipo bajo received the outflow from maipo medio and mapocho bajo sub catchment the monthly water balance in each sub catchment was developed for estimating water maintained in the river after water extractions for socio economic purposes and it is presented in eq 1 1 q o u t p a q in a e t a land w irr w h w ind δ v where q o u t p a q i n a e t a l a n d w i r r w h w i n d r e t d i s and δ v are the runoff flow average precipitation in the catchment total catchment area inflow from upstream catchments including water from artificial canal actual evapotranspiration area of each land use including natural vegetation lands agriculture lands urban lands water bodies and bare soil lands net water extractions for irrigation households and industry including surface and groundwater extractions and change on water storage respectively the data used for the estimation of each component of the water balance over the study period is detailed in table 1 and the estimation methods are described as follows inflows from the upstream mapocho bajo basin to maipo medio basin and mapocho bajo basin were obtained from fluviometric stations located on the closure of the corresponding catchments in the case of maipo bajo inflow corresponded to the sum of runoff from maipo medio and mapocho bajo actual evapotranspiration for each catchment was estimated using a modified budyko framework for monthly time steps proposed by du et al 2016 presented in eq 2 2 et pe 1 eto pe 1 eto pe w λ 1 w and 3 pe p a q in where et p e e t o w a n d λ are actual evapotranspiration total water available for evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration estimated using the penman monteith method detailed in fao56 and two non dimensional parameters w a catchment parameter related to the soil land type and topography and λ a parameter related to rainfall intensity or hydraulic conductivity du et al 2016 the two parameters were calibrated using observed evapotranspiration from modis running et al 2019 by minimizing the rmse as observed evaporation from modis was available from 2000 the chosen calibration period was from 2000 to 2014 the validation process of monthly actual evapotranspiration was conducted from 2015 to 2019 using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias changes in land use areas including natural vegetation agricultural lands and urban lands for each catchment were obtained from the land use coverage of the metropolitan region derived from satellite images on the years 1997 2001 2013 and 2017 conaf 2018 the crops cultivated in the basin were grouped into seven types depending on their characteristics and water demands the crop types were cereals legumes and tubers industrial crops fruits vegetables vines and forage the area used by each crop type during each year of the study period was obtained from the agricultural census and cadasters see table 1 then water extracted for irrigation on each water catchment was obtained using eq 4 4 w irr t crop 1 7 max e t o t k crop e t t 0 a crop t eff irrmethod t r e u s e d t eff channels w e l l s where k crop a crop eff irrmethod eff channels w e l l s are the monthly crop coefficient corresponding to each crop type area used by each crop type irrigation efficiency and efficiency of channels or wells depending if the water was extracted from surface runoff or groundwater annual change in irrigation efficiency was estimated with the percentage of area irrigated with different irrigation methods available from agricultural census table 1 and the efficiency associated to each method reused corresponds to the amount of water lost by irrigation used by downstream agriculture lands obtained using a constant percentage of the water loss by irrigation method or water not used by crops return flow from irrigation was estimated as the difference between total water extracted for irrigation and total water used by crops and was assumed to return to the main channel at the closure of the catchment water extracted for potable drinking water household was estimated using eq 5 5 w h t urban pop t w urban eff prodanddist r u r a l p o p t w rural where urba n pop w urban rural pop w rural and eff prodanddist are urban population urban water supplied in lt hab day rural population rural water supplied in lt hab day and the efficiency of the production and distribution process of potable water an average daily urban water supplied was obtained for each province located within the metropolitan region based on the data provided by the superintendency of sanitary services of chile siss to obtain water consumed for the rural population we used a constant value of litres per habitant per day of the total rural population located on each catchment discharge from household s sewage was obtained based on a coefficient of recovery of total water supplied given by treatment sewage plants and was assumed to returned to the main channel at the closure of the catchment total water for the industry was approximate only 2 of total extractions dga 2017 it was assumed constant over the study period due to limited data available total water consumed by industries on each of the catchments was obtained by considering a monthly average water demand of those industries geographically located on each of the catchments similarly water discharge from industry s sewage was obtained with a coefficient of recovery of total water supplied to industries given by treatment sewage plants change in groundwater storage for maipo medio and mapocho bajo was estimated using observed monthly changes in aquifers height with eq 6 6 δ g aquifer 1 x s y aquifer d h aquifer dt a aquifer where sy is the specific yield of each aquifer storage coefficient a aquifer is the aquifer area and h is the height of the water level from static levels of wells the parameters controlling change in water storage and subsurface runoff by assuming a linear storage runoff coefficient wang et al 2009 on the maipo bajo basin were calibrated to fit monthly surface runoff observed in cabimbao fluviometric station located at the basin s closure the calibration was undertaken by minimizing the nash sutcliffe and rmse for the period between 1990 and 2002 simulated surface runoff at the closure of maipo bajo was then validated for the period 2003 to 2019 by using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias metrics 2 4 economic outcomes the equations used to track the economic outcomes of agriculture drinking water and hydropower over the study period are described below all data required for estimating the economic outcomes was available and is detailed in table 1 agriculture economic outcomes on the entire study area was estimated with eq 7 7 econ agriculture crop 1 7 p crop a crop y i e l d crop c o s t s irr a crop value water w irr where p c a c y i e l d c c o s t s irr value water a n d w irr are the crop s price area each crop type crop yield total costs per hectare shadow value of water or opportunity cost and water extracted for irrigation obtained from eq 4 drinking water economic outcomes associated only with the producer surplus was estimated with eq 8 8 econ household u r b a n s u p p l y p pot f c month n c p p w where urbansupply p pot f c month a n d n c are the total water supply for urban population obtained from eq 5 price per cubic meter of water the monthly fixed charge and the number of residential clients p pw corresponds to an average percentage of profitability of the producers with respect to total income this value was retrieved based on profitability studies bcn 2019 hydropower economic outcomes was estimated with eq 9 9 econ hydropower h 1 n e n e r g y h e n e r g y p r i c e where h 1 n e n e r g y h is the sum of energy produced from all the hydropower stations operating in the region energyprice corresponds to the marginal cost of energy to estimate total non consumptive water used to generate the corresponding monthly energy of each hydropower station we used eq 10 from cai et al 2006 which was developed in the same river basin 10 w hydropwer h 1 n energ y h 3600 10 6 y h 9 8 1000 h e i g h t h where y h a n d h e i g h t h are the yield coefficient operating efficiency of the associated turbine and the height of each hydropower station 2 5 ecological outcomes the impact of water resources allocation and water environmental regulations on catchment ecosystem could be on quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as water cycles link to nutrients energy and carbon at catchment and lack of data on all these systems in the case catchment we used the accumulated number of months with ecological flow deficit since the beginning of the study period to represent the ecological outcomes e this indicator was chosen as insufficient flow maintained in the river is considered the main factor triggering aquatic ecosystem deterioration riestra 2018 the months with ecological flow deficit representing ecological degradation occurred when the average monthly surface runoff flow is below the minimum ecological flow mef established to maintain river ecosystems the mef for each catchment was estimated following the current legal methodology to estimate mef in chilean water catchments available on https www bcn cl leychile specifically the ecological outcomes expressed as the accumulated ecological degradation at year t ecol t is given by eq 11 and eq 12 11 n i m y 1 q su r i m y m e f 0 q su r i m y m e f 12 ecol i t y 1 t m 1 m 12 n i m y where n i m y records months with water deficit i refers to the sub catchment m to the month and y to the year starting at the beginning of the agricultural season q sur is the average monthly surface runoff without including return flow from irrigation and discharges from sewage treatment plants then the accumulated ecological degradation at agriculture year t correspond to the mean ecol t between the three catchments e c o l t i 1 3 ecol i t 2 6 water environmental regulations the water environmental regulations maintain the ecological systems at catchment and influence water resource allocation through restrictions and norms that regulate water extractions they represent the observable response of the environmental protection agencies to ecological outcomes we used the database of the national library of the congress of chile available online at www leychile cl as it contains all legal frameworks promulgated in chile during history we retrieved all legal frameworks laws decree law dl decree with force of law dfl decrees and resolutions that aim to protect the natural environment of river basins each legal framework includes one or several environmental regulations articles several studies have quantified the trajectory of the social variable over long periods which transforms narratives into quantitative explanatory data through a content coding scheme which is rooted in a context mechanism outcome configurations wei et al 2017 wei et al 2015 built upon these studies we used manual content analysis to extract relevant information from each legal framework including publication date validity status geographic location where the regulations are applicable the environmental theme s topic s each regulation within a legal framework was applied to and the policy instrument used in each regulation the themes were categorized into surface water quality surface water quantity groundwater quality groundwater quantity terrestrial ecosystem aquatic ecosystem and integrated themes includes all the above themes we considered those regulations applicable to the metropolitan region then we quantified the trajectory of water environmental regulations with the accumulated number of in force regulations from the beginning of the study period to reflect the accumulated characteristics of environmental regulations for more details on methodology and results on quantifying the trajectory of water environmental regulations see genova alonso et al 2022 2 7 simulation of the response from water resources allocation and water environmental regulations to economic and ecological outcomes for the response of water environmental regulations to change in the catchment ecological outcomes fig 2 we analysed the linkages between these two components based on the approach proposed by santos martín et al 2013 this method allows exploring the complex relationship between ecological and human systems by identifying trends of the system components and estimating their relationships with structural equations we divided the trajectory of the ecological outcome into transitional phases to observe emerging trends the phases were identified using the method proposed by bernaola galván et al 2001 which localizes tipping points or transitions this method is applicable for non linear systems where tipping points are challenging to identify then we categorized the trends of each identified phase based on the standardized trajectory of ecological outcomes by following the method proposed by santos martín et al 2013 we obtained the slope of the entire period and each phase with linear regression considering the slope for the entire period and for each phase we categorized each phase of ecological outcomes into highly deteriorated deteriorated or stable based on the trends categories proposed by santos martín et al 2013 given that the ecological outcomes are expressed with the accumulated months with ecological flow deficit a stable phase represent a phase with no degradation i e a period where the surface flows were above the mef then the same process was followed to identify and categorize the phases of the evolution of water environmental regulations observed response action from water environmental protection agencies with this approach we could estimate how the water environmental regulations responded to the identified trends of ecological outcomes and analyse the potential linkages between them then we simulated the environmental regulations as a function of ecological outcomes the water environmental regulations envre g t at year t was given by eq 13 13 envre g t α f ecol t the parameters of the equation were calibrated using the observed trajectory of water environmental regulations by minimizing the rmse and using regression analysis the period used for calibration was from 1991 to 2005 the validation process was conducted from 2006 to 2019 using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias metrics for water resources allocation as shown in fig 2 we considered water resources allocation for social economic purposes drinking and agriculture as a function of population growth agricultural land and including the feedback from observed economic outcomes and ecological outcomes for representing the changing rate in total water use for irrigation then the water allocation w t at time t is given by eq 14 14 w t u r b a n po p t w urban r u r a l po p t w rural a agr i t e t mean c β f ecol t 1 ρ f econ agricultur e t 1 ω f e n v r e g t 1 where t is the time step in years starting at the beginning of every agricultural season a agri total agriculture land e t mean average annual actual evapotranspiration urba n pop w urban r u r a l pop w rural and c initial water used for irrigation are known an initial correlation and multi regression analysis between water used for irrigation economic outcomes ecological outcomes and environmental regulations were carried out to test the strength of the relationship between these variables then the parameters of the equation β a n d ρ representing the change on water used for irrigation triggered by previous ecologic and economic outcomes respectively were calibrated using the observed trajectory of water resources allocation for socio economic from 1991 to 2002 the validation process was conducted from 2003 to 2019 using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias metrics 2 8 data collection the data sources for the socio hydrological model described in the sections above are given in table 1 the majority of data used in this study were retrieved from government online datasets and studies additionally we used data from modis mod16a2gf data from the climate and resilience science center cr2 and data requested from the superintendency of sanitary services siss all these data sets have been extensively used in the research and practice of water resources management on the maipo river basin most of them are the only data source available in addition while data are available in most years of the study period the years with missing information were filled with interpolation methods or by assuming average values when reasonable 3 results 3 1 catchment water balance the simulated and observed actual evapotranspiration for the three sub catchments are shown in fig 3 based on general performance rating moriasi et al 2007 the model presented satisfactory results with nse over 0 5 and pbias less than 20 during both calibration and validation periods for the three sub catchments the runoff flow at the closure of maipo medio and mapocho bajo and the simulated and observed surface runoff at the closure of maipo bajo is presented in fig 4 a c the estimated surface runoff during both the calibration and validation periods presents a satisfactory performance with nse over 0 5 and pbias below12 surface runoff at the three catchments presented several months with meagre rates in summer when irrigation season takes place september to april it also presented an overall decreasing trend particularly during the last ten years extremely low flow rates took place in 1990 1994 1996 1998 2003 2007 and 2010 2019 which corresponded to drought years garreaud et al 2020 fig 4d shows total water allocated for consumptive socio economic purposes total water maintained in the river for ecological purposes ecological flow and water use by natural vegetation actual evapotranspiration at a yearly time step initiating at the beginning of the irrigation season it is observed during drought years total water uses for ecological purposes dramatically decreased while total water used for socio economic did not present significant changes fig 4d during the last decade all years except 2015 2016 total water allocated for the socio economic purpose was noticeably higher than water maintained in the river considerably increasing the ratio of the total water used for the socio economic purpose to the ecological purpose 3 2 economic outcomes total water used for the different socio economic sectors changed over the last 30 years fig 5 a drinking water had continually increased as a direct response to urban population growth on the contrary water for agriculture showed a steady decrease this happened for several reasons including a decrease in agricultural lands until 2013 due to significant urban expansion conaf 2018 changes in crop patterns diminishing of irrigated areas due to a decrease in water availability mainly during the last decade and a notable increase in irrigation efficiency over the study period this happened also partly because no additional permanent consumptive water use rights could be granted due to overallocation as agriculture was the most significant water use in the basin a slight decrease in total consumptive water was observed these results coincide with the study of dga 2015 which estimated a slight decrease in total water demand in the maipo river basin between 2007 and 2040 however hydropower generation showed a radical increase since 2009 the economic outcomes are shown in fig 5b agriculture was the main contributor to the economy followed by hydropower production even though total water used for agriculture slightly decreased total agriculture incomes overall slightly increased advances in technology allowing improved productivity and irrigation efficiency and crop plantation shifted to higher value crops explains this situation the economic outcomes of drinking potable water showed a slight and steady increase following population growth the non consumptive water use income fluctuated with a change in the marginal cost of energy finally due to changes observed on the three main productive water uses the total economic outcomes over the study period presented an overall increase until 2007 08 followed by a period with high fluctuations fig 5c 3 3 ecological outcomes although total consumptive water uses slightly decreased total water maintained in the river also presented a decreasing trend in all three catchments fig 4 this happened as the last ten years of drought strongly reduced surface runoff flows as a result the proportion of water extracted to total water availability increased months with ecological flow deficits were mostly observed during the irrigation season and dramatically intensified during prolonged drought periods occurring during the periods 1994 1997 and 2010 2019 fig 6 a overall accumulated ecological degradation increased over the entire period with a slope of 0 12 based on a linear regression of the standardized accumulated ecological degradation fig 6a and b the identified transitional phases of accumulated ecological degradation can be observed in fig 6c e they were divided into three phases following the method to localised tipping points and the phases were categorized based on their slope the first phase was identified as high deterioration slope of 0 14 followed by a deterioration period slope of 0 07 and again a phase of higher deterioration slope of 0 17 these results agree with odepa 2016 which argues that during the last decade central chile was critically affected by the most prolonged droughts negatively affecting the water quantity of natural flows and consequently freshwater ecosystems odepa 2016 vicuña et al 2018 3 4 water environmental regulations the evolution of water environmental regulations over the study period is shown in fig 7 a an overall increase in water environmental regulations was observed with a slope of 0 11 based on a linear regression of the standardized accumulated number of regulations fig 7b the evolution can be divided and categorized into 3 phases fig 7c e the highest improvement was observed in the first phase slope 0 19 the second phase as low improvement stable slope 0 038 and the third again as high improvement slope 0 15 since 1990 the chilean government for the first time started to address ecological issues through the promulgation of regulations policies aiming to protect water resources and associated ecosystems peña 2018 during 1990 and 1998 significant regulations were released the most important legal frameworks include the national environmental framework law law n 19300 in 1994 the foundation of environmental regulations up to present and the environmental impact assessment eia decree n 30 in 1997 in the second phase 1999 to 2009 a smaller number of regulations were promulgated the most important ones were the modifications to the regulations of eia decree n 95 in 2002 the modified water code reform law n 20017 in 2005 specifying for the first time the minimum ecological flows mefs and regulations on water resources to conserve and restore the native forest law 20283 in 2009 finally the third phase 2010 to 2019 presented several more environmental regulations the law that created the ministry of environment law 20417 in 2010 the regulations to determine the mefs and later modifications decree n 14 and decree 71 in 2013 and 2015 regulations for the eia decree 40 in 2013 new regulations of the environmental ministry decree 62 in 2015 establishment of the first environmental regulations program resolution 177 in 2016 establishment of the right of environmental conservation law n 20930 in 2016 and regulations regarding inspections and sanctions associated to water resources law 21064 in 2018 clearly water environmental regulations have strengthened during the study period 3 5 simulation of water resources allocation and water environmental regulations the simulated versus observed trajectory of water environmental regulations is presented in fig 8 a and b the satisfactory results nse over 0 88 and pbias below 5 for both calibration and validation periods indicate that the model successfully captured the feedback from the ecological outcomes to the water environmental regulation the functional forms of the equations and the calibrated parameter are presented in table 2 these results show a strong linear relationship between ecological degradation and water environmental regulations suggesting that the water environmental regulations were triggered by observed ecological degradation nevertheless increasing regulations had not yet been able to counteract or revert the accumulated ecological degradation implying that insufficient or inadequate responses have been made to cope with the negative impact of the water resources allocation under the adverse effects of climate change results from correlation analysis show that water used for irrigation was strongly correlated with the agricultural economic outcomes ecological outcomes and water environmental regulations presenting correlation coefficients of 0 96 0 95 and 0 92 respectively no correlation was found with drinking water and hydropower economic outcomes then under the hypothesis that water resource allocation was influenced by the observed economic outcomes and ecological outcomes results from multi regression analysis indicated that both variables the economic and ecological outcomes were statistically significant presenting both p value below 0 05 moreover given the strong linear relationship between environmental regulations and ecological outcomes the former also allowed to determine the trajectory of water allocation for irrigation p value below 0 05 given the collinearity between environmental regulations and ecological outcomes water allocation was simulated considering the effect of observed economic and ecological outcomes the simulated versus observed trajectory of water resource allocation development with the respective performance analysis are presented in fig 8c and d the satisfactory results nse over 0 5 and pbias below 2 for both calibration and validation period indicate that the model successfully captured the two hypothetical feedbacks the functional forms of the equations and the calibrated parameter are presented in table 2 these results suggest that agricultural economic growth and an increase in ecological degradation may have contributed to a decrease in water used for irrigation in the case study higher value crops technology improvement and efficient farming practices allow increasing agriculture income per unit of water then positive economic outcomes provided feedback to continue maximizing their benefits despite water limitations by investing in better technologies meza et al 2014 it is also found that the ecological outcomes expressed as accumulated ecological degradation provided feedback to decrease in water demand as there is an acknowledgement that ecological degradation threatened ecosystem services these results are well supported with qualitative analysis of relevant studies cnr 2016 meza et al 2014 4 discussion and conclusions this paper developed a processed based socio hydrological model to track the evolution of water used for economic and ecological uses and to simulate the response of water resources allocation and water environmental regulations to their resultant socio economic and ecological outcomes in the maipo river basin chile over the last 30 years the key findings and implications for future research and management practices are summarized as follows this study firstly independently quantified the main components of the socio hydrological model water balance for water resources allocation the resulting economic outcomes and ecologic outcomes and water environmental regulations over the study period we expressed the trajectory of the ecological outcomes with the accumulated months with ecological flow deficit which is the key link between water resources allocation and water environmental protection we also presented a method to quantify the trajectory of water environmental regulations representing the social component of the socio hydrological model by transforming narratives into quantitative explanatory data through a content coding scheme this model successfully simulated water resource allocation and water environmental regulation development in addition with the independent quantification of the social component water environmental regulations in this study this study overcame the challenge of measuring the social component as a function of environmental degradation without being directly calibrated with social data in previous socio hydrological models this socio hydrological model allowed a process based understanding of the feedback from socio economic and ecological outcomes to the water resources allocation and water environmental regulations fig 2 firstly it was found that water environmental regulations showed a strongly responsive behaviour to observed accumulated ecological degradation from previous water resources allocation decisions and climate conditions it was also found that the phase of highest ecological degradation 2010 to 2019 did not receive the highest improvement in environmental regulations this implies that more preventive and effective water environmental regulations should be taken secondly it was found that during the last decade of drought water extractions had very slightly diminished but the ratio of water used for socio economic purposes to ecological purposes had largely increased 0 6 to 1 2 this has resulted in that the economic benefit of consumptive water uses benefit did not increase however the most severe ecological degradation phase occurred the model results indicate that water resource allocation for irrigation in the maipo river basin was strongly affected by the observed agricultural economic outcomes and accumulated ecological degradation both contributing to the decrease in total water extraction for irrigation the water allocation system also presented a strong negative correlation with the water environmental regulations implying that a decrease in water allocation for irrigation may also be influenced by the response of water environmental regulations to the observed ecological degradation the development of this socio hydrological model can assist in projecting future trajectories of the human water system s behaviour under changing scenarios although the simulation of the future socio economic and climatic scenarios is beyond the scope of this study it is expected that climate change will further negatively affect the study basin projecting a decrease in water resources availability meza et al 2014 also projections believed the population would continue increasing ine 2019 under this future scenario based on our model a slight decrease in water extractions for consumptive water uses would be expected but ecological degradation could be worsened due to climate change an increase in environmental regulations is expected however as learned from the past but it must be stronger synchronized and coordinated with water resources allocation decisions to revert the ecological degradation this study presents several limitations 1 catchment water balance could be improved with modelling tools that better capture the characteristics and processes of the basin 2 only the formal environmental regulations were considered while informal environmental governances were neglected 3 a simple ecological outcomes indicator was used and 4 potential additional drivers influencing the response of water resource allocation and water environmental regulations systems were neglected for the purpose of this study nevertheless

2348,overuse of water resources has led to serious ecological degradation in most river basins however there is little processed based understanding of the dynamic feedback between management decisions from different sectors in river basins and their resultant socio economic and ecological outcomes this study developed a socio hydrological model to track the evolution of water used for socio economic and ecological uses and to simulate the response of water resource allocation and water environmental regulations to the resulting economic and ecological outcomes it was applied in the maipo river basin chile from 1990 to 2019 the results show that this model successfully simulated water resources allocation and water environmental regulations over time water environmental regulations showed a strongly linear responsive behaviour to observed accumulated ecological degradation results also show that the observed decrease in water resource allocation for economic uses was influenced by increasing agricultural economic benefits and accumulated ecological degradation it is suggested that environmental regulations should be stronger synchronized and coordinated with water resources allocation decisions to revert the increasing ecological degradation this socio hydrological model with revision into different contexts could be used to assess integrated water resources and water environmental management in other river basins keywords socio hydrology water resources management water resources allocation water regulations environmental regulations data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction overuse of water resources has led to serious ecological degradation in most river basins especially in regions where water resources are scarce

water allocation to the natural environment chen et al 2016 elshafei et al 2015 elshafei et al 2014 kandasamy et al 2014 van emmerik et al 2014 these studies have often incorporated for example the environmental awareness a function of environmental degradation as the social variables without being directly calibrated with social data chen et al 2016 elshafei et al 2015 elshafei et al 2014 roobavannan et al 2018 van emmerik et al 2014 therefore despite of these advances in socio hydrology models there are no recognized methods for representing and quantifying the social component and explicitly incorporating it into these models di baldassarre et al 2019 roobavannan et al 2018 water resources management agencies and environmental protection agencies are major sectors for water management decisions in river basins the former has the primary objective to achieve an efficient water resources allocation to maximize the economic benefits without compromising the sustainability of the riverine ecological system which is the recent goal for some river basins and the latter often revises existing or issues new water environmental regulations to maintain the ecological systems at river basin and influence water resources allocation through restrictions and norms that regulate water extractions in addition there may exist delays between governance decisions and their resultant ecological outcomes therefore understanding the dynamic feedback between the management decisions of these two sectors and their resultant unintended and undesirable socio economic and ecological outcomes is required to develop integrated water resources and water environment management this paper aims to develop a socio hydrological model for assessing water resources allocation and water environmental regulations and their response to the resulting economic and ecological outcomes for improving integrated water resources and water environment management at river basins the maipo river basin located in central chile is chosen as the case study as water management in chile is globally recognised the expected outputs from this study will be a novel method to quantitively simulate the feedback from the changing socio economic and ecological outcomes to water resources allocation and water environmental regulations in which the social component water environmental regulations was independently quantified and calibrated 2 methods 2 1 case study description the maipo river basin located in central chile is home to santiago city covering almost the entire metropolitan region fig 1 the maipo river has a total length of 250 km from its origin on andes cordillera into the pacific ocean the main land uses in this basin include urban 8 8 agriculture 14 2 prairies scrubs and forests near 52 wetlands 0 8 bare soil 16 6 snow and glaciers 6 6 and water bodies 0 6 martínez et al 2013 this basin has a mediterranean climate with two clear seasons the wet season april to october and the dry season september to march streamflow is fed from precipitation mostly during winter and from snowmelt from the upper mountains during spring and summer annual precipitation is around 330 mm in the central valley meza et al 2014 during the last decade this region has experienced the most prolonged drought evidenced by a large decline in total water available in the basin and a negative impact on water users urban water supply and natural ecosystems farías barahona et al 2020 garreaud et al 2020 meza et al 2014 odepa 2016 vicuña et al 2018 the maipo river basin is home to approximately 40 of the total chilean population and around 42 of total national economic activity arróspide et al 2018 hearne 2018 consumptive and non consumptive water uses include irrigation drinking water hydropower recreational activities and maintenance of ecological systems irrigation is the primary consumptive water use reaching approximately 62 of total demand dga 2017 with around 136 000 ha under irrigation ine 2007 the second main use is drinking water representing a 32 of total consumptive water demand dga 2017 hydropower is highly developed on the basin with total non consumptive water uses of around 5670 mm3 per year dga 2017 having up to 20 hydropower stations generating 360 mw coordinador eléctrico nacional 2021 in addition this basin is globally considered as one of the 25 biodiversity hotspots and one of the five mediterranean ecosystems however this basin is highly degraded the main ecological issues being water deficit water pollution and loss of habitat cnr 2016 conama rm 2010 the prolongated drought experienced in this region have resulted in a significant reduction of water availability groundwater levels mean river discharges and a negative impact in water quality consequently affecting aquatic terrestrial and coastal ecosystems garreaud et al 2020 peña guerrero et al 2020 vicuña et al 2018 moreover it is expected that climate change will further negatively affect the study basin garreaud et al 2020 meza et al 2014 results from díaz et al 2019 conclude that an increase in the degradation of the maipo river is expected in the near future water resources in chile are managed by several independent agencies at the local regional and national levels each with its own responsibilities world bank 2013 the general water directorate is a body of the state responsible for water resources management at the national level and its equivalates at other levels the ministry of environment is responsible for issuing environmental regulations either for the whole country or some specific regions peña 2018 poor communication and coordination between water environmental protection agencies and water resources management agencies are highly recognised in major river basins e g the maipo river basin and often resulted in undesired ecological outcomes cnr 2016 oecd 2011 oecd 2012 universidad de chile 2019 world bank 2013 therefore the maipo river basin is an ideal case for the purpose of this study 2 2 model formulation a socio hydrological conceptual model for simulating the feedback from economic and ecological outcomes to the water resources allocation and water environmental regulations in the maipo river basin was developed based on recent advances in socio hydrological model lu et al 2018 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 and site specific characteristics in the case area fig 2 the model consists of four main components representing the coupling socio ecological systems they are i water environmental regulations ii water resources allocation water use for socio economic purposes and for ecological purposes iii economic outcomes associated with all the productive uses of water representing the producer s surplus subject to total water availability productivity efficiency costs and the price of products and iv ecological outcomes expressed as the accumulated ecological degradation as ecological issues worsen when they persist in time a typical slow variable relative to change in economic system and hydrological system the external drivers of this model include climatic conditions population land use pattern water rights and technological advances for example irrigation methods which directly affect water resource allocation and both economic and ecological outcomes it is hypothesized that the annual water resource allocation is influenced by the water environmental regulations and feedback of both observed socio economic outcomes and ecological outcomes it is also hypothesized that water environment regulations revision or issuing new items are mainly influenced by the feedback of observed ecological outcomes the environmental regulations may be affected by the national economic situation but our previous study has found that nation wide water environmental regulations had a strong positive correlation with the national economic growth gdp genova alonso et al 2022 thus they were not included in this study to implement this conceptual model in the maipo river basin the spatial domain included three sub catchments of the maipo river basin mapocho bajo basin maipo medio basin and maipo bajo basin highlighted in fig 1 the model considered a monthly water resources allocation water uses while the economic outcomes ecological outcomes water environmental regulation and all the feedbacks considered as an annual time step the study encompassed a time scale of 30 years between 1990 and 2019 we chose this timeframe as the significant ecological degradation and environmental regulations started only after the 1990s the methods for estimating each model component and the feedback loops in fig 2 are formulated in the following sections 2 3 catchment water balance the monthly water balance was developed for each sub catchment considering the existing interconnections between them the flow from the upper sub basin maipo alto contributes to mapocho bajo and maipo medio sub catchments a fraction of the outflow from the alto maipo is diverted by the san carlos canal an artificial canal to supply the high urban and agricultural water demand in the mapocho bajo sub catchment the total water from maipo alto to mapocho bajo was estimated considering a distribution factor subject to the maximum capacity of the san carlos canal based on dga 2015 the remaining flow from maipo alto naturally contributes to the maipo medio finally maipo bajo received the outflow from maipo medio and mapocho bajo sub catchment the monthly water balance in each sub catchment was developed for estimating water maintained in the river after water extractions for socio economic purposes and it is presented in eq 1 1 q o u t p a q in a e t a land w irr w h w ind δ v where q o u t p a q i n a e t a l a n d w i r r w h w i n d r e t d i s and δ v are the runoff flow average precipitation in the catchment total catchment area inflow from upstream catchments including water from artificial canal actual evapotranspiration area of each land use including natural vegetation lands agriculture lands urban lands water bodies and bare soil lands net water extractions for irrigation households and industry including surface and groundwater extractions and change on water storage respectively the data used for the estimation of each component of the water balance over the study period is detailed in table 1 and the estimation methods are described as follows inflows from the upstream mapocho bajo basin to maipo medio basin and mapocho bajo basin were obtained from fluviometric stations located on the closure of the corresponding catchments in the case of maipo bajo inflow corresponded to the sum of runoff from maipo medio and mapocho bajo actual evapotranspiration for each catchment was estimated using a modified budyko framework for monthly time steps proposed by du et al 2016 presented in eq 2 2 et pe 1 eto pe 1 eto pe w λ 1 w and 3 pe p a q in where et p e e t o w a n d λ are actual evapotranspiration total water available for evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration estimated using the penman monteith method detailed in fao56 and two non dimensional parameters w a catchment parameter related to the soil land type and topography and λ a parameter related to rainfall intensity or hydraulic conductivity du et al 2016 the two parameters were calibrated using observed evapotranspiration from modis running et al 2019 by minimizing the rmse as observed evaporation from modis was available from 2000 the chosen calibration period was from 2000 to 2014 the validation process of monthly actual evapotranspiration was conducted from 2015 to 2019 using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias changes in land use areas including natural vegetation agricultural lands and urban lands for each catchment were obtained from the land use coverage of the metropolitan region derived from satellite images on the years 1997 2001 2013 and 2017 conaf 2018 the crops cultivated in the basin were grouped into seven types depending on their characteristics and water demands the crop types were cereals legumes and tubers industrial crops fruits vegetables vines and forage the area used by each crop type during each year of the study period was obtained from the agricultural census and cadasters see table 1 then water extracted for irrigation on each water catchment was obtained using eq 4 4 w irr t crop 1 7 max e t o t k crop e t t 0 a crop t eff irrmethod t r e u s e d t eff channels w e l l s where k crop a crop eff irrmethod eff channels w e l l s are the monthly crop coefficient corresponding to each crop type area used by each crop type irrigation efficiency and efficiency of channels or wells depending if the water was extracted from surface runoff or groundwater annual change in irrigation efficiency was estimated with the percentage of area irrigated with different irrigation methods available from agricultural census table 1 and the efficiency associated to each method reused corresponds to the amount of water lost by irrigation used by downstream agriculture lands obtained using a constant percentage of the water loss by irrigation method or water not used by crops return flow from irrigation was estimated as the difference between total water extracted for irrigation and total water used by crops and was assumed to return to the main channel at the closure of the catchment water extracted for potable drinking water household was estimated using eq 5 5 w h t urban pop t w urban eff prodanddist r u r a l p o p t w rural where urba n pop w urban rural pop w rural and eff prodanddist are urban population urban water supplied in lt hab day rural population rural water supplied in lt hab day and the efficiency of the production and distribution process of potable water an average daily urban water supplied was obtained for each province located within the metropolitan region based on the data provided by the superintendency of sanitary services of chile siss to obtain water consumed for the rural population we used a constant value of litres per habitant per day of the total rural population located on each catchment discharge from household s sewage was obtained based on a coefficient of recovery of total water supplied given by treatment sewage plants and was assumed to returned to the main channel at the closure of the catchment total water for the industry was approximate only 2 of total extractions dga 2017 it was assumed constant over the study period due to limited data available total water consumed by industries on each of the catchments was obtained by considering a monthly average water demand of those industries geographically located on each of the catchments similarly water discharge from industry s sewage was obtained with a coefficient of recovery of total water supplied to industries given by treatment sewage plants change in groundwater storage for maipo medio and mapocho bajo was estimated using observed monthly changes in aquifers height with eq 6 6 δ g aquifer 1 x s y aquifer d h aquifer dt a aquifer where sy is the specific yield of each aquifer storage coefficient a aquifer is the aquifer area and h is the height of the water level from static levels of wells the parameters controlling change in water storage and subsurface runoff by assuming a linear storage runoff coefficient wang et al 2009 on the maipo bajo basin were calibrated to fit monthly surface runoff observed in cabimbao fluviometric station located at the basin s closure the calibration was undertaken by minimizing the nash sutcliffe and rmse for the period between 1990 and 2002 simulated surface runoff at the closure of maipo bajo was then validated for the period 2003 to 2019 by using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias metrics 2 4 economic outcomes the equations used to track the economic outcomes of agriculture drinking water and hydropower over the study period are described below all data required for estimating the economic outcomes was available and is detailed in table 1 agriculture economic outcomes on the entire study area was estimated with eq 7 7 econ agriculture crop 1 7 p crop a crop y i e l d crop c o s t s irr a crop value water w irr where p c a c y i e l d c c o s t s irr value water a n d w irr are the crop s price area each crop type crop yield total costs per hectare shadow value of water or opportunity cost and water extracted for irrigation obtained from eq 4 drinking water economic outcomes associated only with the producer surplus was estimated with eq 8 8 econ household u r b a n s u p p l y p pot f c month n c p p w where urbansupply p pot f c month a n d n c are the total water supply for urban population obtained from eq 5 price per cubic meter of water the monthly fixed charge and the number of residential clients p pw corresponds to an average percentage of profitability of the producers with respect to total income this value was retrieved based on profitability studies bcn 2019 hydropower economic outcomes was estimated with eq 9 9 econ hydropower h 1 n e n e r g y h e n e r g y p r i c e where h 1 n e n e r g y h is the sum of energy produced from all the hydropower stations operating in the region energyprice corresponds to the marginal cost of energy to estimate total non consumptive water used to generate the corresponding monthly energy of each hydropower station we used eq 10 from cai et al 2006 which was developed in the same river basin 10 w hydropwer h 1 n energ y h 3600 10 6 y h 9 8 1000 h e i g h t h where y h a n d h e i g h t h are the yield coefficient operating efficiency of the associated turbine and the height of each hydropower station 2 5 ecological outcomes the impact of water resources allocation and water environmental regulations on catchment ecosystem could be on quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as water cycles link to nutrients energy and carbon at catchment and lack of data on all these systems in the case catchment we used the accumulated number of months with ecological flow deficit since the beginning of the study period to represent the ecological outcomes e this indicator was chosen as insufficient flow maintained in the river is considered the main factor triggering aquatic ecosystem deterioration riestra 2018 the months with ecological flow deficit representing ecological degradation occurred when the average monthly surface runoff flow is below the minimum ecological flow mef established to maintain river ecosystems the mef for each catchment was estimated following the current legal methodology to estimate mef in chilean water catchments available on https www bcn cl leychile specifically the ecological outcomes expressed as the accumulated ecological degradation at year t ecol t is given by eq 11 and eq 12 11 n i m y 1 q su r i m y m e f 0 q su r i m y m e f 12 ecol i t y 1 t m 1 m 12 n i m y where n i m y records months with water deficit i refers to the sub catchment m to the month and y to the year starting at the beginning of the agricultural season q sur is the average monthly surface runoff without including return flow from irrigation and discharges from sewage treatment plants then the accumulated ecological degradation at agriculture year t correspond to the mean ecol t between the three catchments e c o l t i 1 3 ecol i t 2 6 water environmental regulations the water environmental regulations maintain the ecological systems at catchment and influence water resource allocation through restrictions and norms that regulate water extractions they represent the observable response of the environmental protection agencies to ecological outcomes we used the database of the national library of the congress of chile available online at www leychile cl as it contains all legal frameworks promulgated in chile during history we retrieved all legal frameworks laws decree law dl decree with force of law dfl decrees and resolutions that aim to protect the natural environment of river basins each legal framework includes one or several environmental regulations articles several studies have quantified the trajectory of the social variable over long periods which transforms narratives into quantitative explanatory data through a content coding scheme which is rooted in a context mechanism outcome configurations wei et al 2017 wei et al 2015 built upon these studies we used manual content analysis to extract relevant information from each legal framework including publication date validity status geographic location where the regulations are applicable the environmental theme s topic s each regulation within a legal framework was applied to and the policy instrument used in each regulation the themes were categorized into surface water quality surface water quantity groundwater quality groundwater quantity terrestrial ecosystem aquatic ecosystem and integrated themes includes all the above themes we considered those regulations applicable to the metropolitan region then we quantified the trajectory of water environmental regulations with the accumulated number of in force regulations from the beginning of the study period to reflect the accumulated characteristics of environmental regulations for more details on methodology and results on quantifying the trajectory of water environmental regulations see genova alonso et al 2022 2 7 simulation of the response from water resources allocation and water environmental regulations to economic and ecological outcomes for the response of water environmental regulations to change in the catchment ecological outcomes fig 2 we analysed the linkages between these two components based on the approach proposed by santos martín et al 2013 this method allows exploring the complex relationship between ecological and human systems by identifying trends of the system components and estimating their relationships with structural equations we divided the trajectory of the ecological outcome into transitional phases to observe emerging trends the phases were identified using the method proposed by bernaola galván et al 2001 which localizes tipping points or transitions this method is applicable for non linear systems where tipping points are challenging to identify then we categorized the trends of each identified phase based on the standardized trajectory of ecological outcomes by following the method proposed by santos martín et al 2013 we obtained the slope of the entire period and each phase with linear regression considering the slope for the entire period and for each phase we categorized each phase of ecological outcomes into highly deteriorated deteriorated or stable based on the trends categories proposed by santos martín et al 2013 given that the ecological outcomes are expressed with the accumulated months with ecological flow deficit a stable phase represent a phase with no degradation i e a period where the surface flows were above the mef then the same process was followed to identify and categorize the phases of the evolution of water environmental regulations observed response action from water environmental protection agencies with this approach we could estimate how the water environmental regulations responded to the identified trends of ecological outcomes and analyse the potential linkages between them then we simulated the environmental regulations as a function of ecological outcomes the water environmental regulations envre g t at year t was given by eq 13 13 envre g t α f ecol t the parameters of the equation were calibrated using the observed trajectory of water environmental regulations by minimizing the rmse and using regression analysis the period used for calibration was from 1991 to 2005 the validation process was conducted from 2006 to 2019 using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias metrics for water resources allocation as shown in fig 2 we considered water resources allocation for social economic purposes drinking and agriculture as a function of population growth agricultural land and including the feedback from observed economic outcomes and ecological outcomes for representing the changing rate in total water use for irrigation then the water allocation w t at time t is given by eq 14 14 w t u r b a n po p t w urban r u r a l po p t w rural a agr i t e t mean c β f ecol t 1 ρ f econ agricultur e t 1 ω f e n v r e g t 1 where t is the time step in years starting at the beginning of every agricultural season a agri total agriculture land e t mean average annual actual evapotranspiration urba n pop w urban r u r a l pop w rural and c initial water used for irrigation are known an initial correlation and multi regression analysis between water used for irrigation economic outcomes ecological outcomes and environmental regulations were carried out to test the strength of the relationship between these variables then the parameters of the equation β a n d ρ representing the change on water used for irrigation triggered by previous ecologic and economic outcomes respectively were calibrated using the observed trajectory of water resources allocation for socio economic from 1991 to 2002 the validation process was conducted from 2003 to 2019 using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias metrics 2 8 data collection the data sources for the socio hydrological model described in the sections above are given in table 1 the majority of data used in this study were retrieved from government online datasets and studies additionally we used data from modis mod16a2gf data from the climate and resilience science center cr2 and data requested from the superintendency of sanitary services siss all these data sets have been extensively used in the research and practice of water resources management on the maipo river basin most of them are the only data source available in addition while data are available in most years of the study period the years with missing information were filled with interpolation methods or by assuming average values when reasonable 3 results 3 1 catchment water balance the simulated and observed actual evapotranspiration for the three sub catchments are shown in fig 3 based on general performance rating moriasi et al 2007 the model presented satisfactory results with nse over 0 5 and pbias less than 20 during both calibration and validation periods for the three sub catchments the runoff flow at the closure of maipo medio and mapocho bajo and the simulated and observed surface runoff at the closure of maipo bajo is presented in fig 4 a c the estimated surface runoff during both the calibration and validation periods presents a satisfactory performance with nse over 0 5 and pbias below12 surface runoff at the three catchments presented several months with meagre rates in summer when irrigation season takes place september to april it also presented an overall decreasing trend particularly during the last ten years extremely low flow rates took place in 1990 1994 1996 1998 2003 2007 and 2010 2019 which corresponded to drought years garreaud et al 2020 fig 4d shows total water allocated for consumptive socio economic purposes total water maintained in the river for ecological purposes ecological flow and water use by natural vegetation actual evapotranspiration at a yearly time step initiating at the beginning of the irrigation season it is observed during drought years total water uses for ecological purposes dramatically decreased while total water used for socio economic did not present significant changes fig 4d during the last decade all years except 2015 2016 total water allocated for the socio economic purpose was noticeably higher than water maintained in the river considerably increasing the ratio of the total water used for the socio economic purpose to the ecological purpose 3 2 economic outcomes total water used for the different socio economic sectors changed over the last 30 years fig 5 a drinking water had continually increased as a direct response to urban population growth on the contrary water for agriculture showed a steady decrease this happened for several reasons including a decrease in agricultural lands until 2013 due to significant urban expansion conaf 2018 changes in crop patterns diminishing of irrigated areas due to a decrease in water availability mainly during the last decade and a notable increase in irrigation efficiency over the study period this happened also partly because no additional permanent consumptive water use rights could be granted due to overallocation as agriculture was the most significant water use in the basin a slight decrease in total consumptive water was observed these results coincide with the study of dga 2015 which estimated a slight decrease in total water demand in the maipo river basin between 2007 and 2040 however hydropower generation showed a radical increase since 2009 the economic outcomes are shown in fig 5b agriculture was the main contributor to the economy followed by hydropower production even though total water used for agriculture slightly decreased total agriculture incomes overall slightly increased advances in technology allowing improved productivity and irrigation efficiency and crop plantation shifted to higher value crops explains this situation the economic outcomes of drinking potable water showed a slight and steady increase following population growth the non consumptive water use income fluctuated with a change in the marginal cost of energy finally due to changes observed on the three main productive water uses the total economic outcomes over the study period presented an overall increase until 2007 08 followed by a period with high fluctuations fig 5c 3 3 ecological outcomes although total consumptive water uses slightly decreased total water maintained in the river also presented a decreasing trend in all three catchments fig 4 this happened as the last ten years of drought strongly reduced surface runoff flows as a result the proportion of water extracted to total water availability increased months with ecological flow deficits were mostly observed during the irrigation season and dramatically intensified during prolonged drought periods occurring during the periods 1994 1997 and 2010 2019 fig 6 a overall accumulated ecological degradation increased over the entire period with a slope of 0 12 based on a linear regression of the standardized accumulated ecological degradation fig 6a and b the identified transitional phases of accumulated ecological degradation can be observed in fig 6c e they were divided into three phases following the method to localised tipping points and the phases were categorized based on their slope the first phase was identified as high deterioration slope of 0 14 followed by a deterioration period slope of 0 07 and again a phase of higher deterioration slope of 0 17 these results agree with odepa 2016 which argues that during the last decade central chile was critically affected by the most prolonged droughts negatively affecting the water quantity of natural flows and consequently freshwater ecosystems odepa 2016 vicuña et al 2018 3 4 water environmental regulations the evolution of water environmental regulations over the study period is shown in fig 7 a an overall increase in water environmental regulations was observed with a slope of 0 11 based on a linear regression of the standardized accumulated number of regulations fig 7b the evolution can be divided and categorized into 3 phases fig 7c e the highest improvement was observed in the first phase slope 0 19 the second phase as low improvement stable slope 0 038 and the third again as high improvement slope 0 15 since 1990 the chilean government for the first time started to address ecological issues through the promulgation of regulations policies aiming to protect water resources and associated ecosystems peña 2018 during 1990 and 1998 significant regulations were released the most important legal frameworks include the national environmental framework law law n 19300 in 1994 the foundation of environmental regulations up to present and the environmental impact assessment eia decree n 30 in 1997 in the second phase 1999 to 2009 a smaller number of regulations were promulgated the most important ones were the modifications to the regulations of eia decree n 95 in 2002 the modified water code reform law n 20017 in 2005 specifying for the first time the minimum ecological flows mefs and regulations on water resources to conserve and restore the native forest law 20283 in 2009 finally the third phase 2010 to 2019 presented several more environmental regulations the law that created the ministry of environment law 20417 in 2010 the regulations to determine the mefs and later modifications decree n 14 and decree 71 in 2013 and 2015 regulations for the eia decree 40 in 2013 new regulations of the environmental ministry decree 62 in 2015 establishment of the first environmental regulations program resolution 177 in 2016 establishment of the right of environmental conservation law n 20930 in 2016 and regulations regarding inspections and sanctions associated to water resources law 21064 in 2018 clearly water environmental regulations have strengthened during the study period 3 5 simulation of water resources allocation and water environmental regulations the simulated versus observed trajectory of water environmental regulations is presented in fig 8 a and b the satisfactory results nse over 0 88 and pbias below 5 for both calibration and validation periods indicate that the model successfully captured the feedback from the ecological outcomes to the water environmental regulation the functional forms of the equations and the calibrated parameter are presented in table 2 these results show a strong linear relationship between ecological degradation and water environmental regulations suggesting that the water environmental regulations were triggered by observed ecological degradation nevertheless increasing regulations had not yet been able to counteract or revert the accumulated ecological degradation implying that insufficient or inadequate responses have been made to cope with the negative impact of the water resources allocation under the adverse effects of climate change results from correlation analysis show that water used for irrigation was strongly correlated with the agricultural economic outcomes ecological outcomes and water environmental regulations presenting correlation coefficients of 0 96 0 95 and 0 92 respectively no correlation was found with drinking water and hydropower economic outcomes then under the hypothesis that water resource allocation was influenced by the observed economic outcomes and ecological outcomes results from multi regression analysis indicated that both variables the economic and ecological outcomes were statistically significant presenting both p value below 0 05 moreover given the strong linear relationship between environmental regulations and ecological outcomes the former also allowed to determine the trajectory of water allocation for irrigation p value below 0 05 given the collinearity between environmental regulations and ecological outcomes water allocation was simulated considering the effect of observed economic and ecological outcomes the simulated versus observed trajectory of water resource allocation development with the respective performance analysis are presented in fig 8c and d the satisfactory results nse over 0 5 and pbias below 2 for both calibration and validation period indicate that the model successfully captured the two hypothetical feedbacks the functional forms of the equations and the calibrated parameter are presented in table 2 these results suggest that agricultural economic growth and an increase in ecological degradation may have contributed to a decrease in water used for irrigation in the case study higher value crops technology improvement and efficient farming practices allow increasing agriculture income per unit of water then positive economic outcomes provided feedback to continue maximizing their benefits despite water limitations by investing in better technologies meza et al 2014 it is also found that the ecological outcomes expressed as accumulated ecological degradation provided feedback to decrease in water demand as there is an acknowledgement that ecological degradation threatened ecosystem services these results are well supported with qualitative analysis of relevant studies cnr 2016 meza et al 2014 4 discussion and conclusions this paper developed a processed based socio hydrological model to track the evolution of water used for economic and ecological uses and to simulate the response of water resources allocation and water environmental regulations to their resultant socio economic and ecological outcomes in the maipo river basin chile over the last 30 years the key findings and implications for future research and management practices are summarized as follows this study firstly independently quantified the main components of the socio hydrological model water balance for water resources allocation the resulting economic outcomes and ecologic outcomes and water environmental regulations over the study period we expressed the trajectory of the ecological outcomes with the accumulated months with ecological flow deficit which is the key link between water resources allocation and water environmental protection we also presented a method to quantify the trajectory of water environmental regulations representing the social component of the socio hydrological model by transforming narratives into quantitative explanatory data through a content coding scheme this model successfully simulated water resource allocation and water environmental regulation development in addition with the independent quantification of the social component water environmental regulations in this study this study overcame the challenge of measuring the social component as a function of environmental degradation without being directly calibrated with social data in previous socio hydrological models this socio hydrological model allowed a process based understanding of the feedback from socio economic and ecological outcomes to the water resources allocation and water environmental regulations fig 2 firstly it was found that water environmental regulations showed a strongly responsive behaviour to observed accumulated ecological degradation from previous water resources allocation decisions and climate conditions it was also found that the phase of highest ecological degradation 2010 to 2019 did not receive the highest improvement in environmental regulations this implies that more preventive and effective water environmental regulations should be taken secondly it was found that during the last decade of drought water extractions had very slightly diminished but the ratio of water used for socio economic purposes to ecological purposes had largely increased 0 6 to 1 2 this has resulted in that the economic benefit of consumptive water uses benefit did not increase however the most severe ecological degradation phase occurred the model results indicate that water resource allocation for irrigation in the maipo river basin was strongly affected by the observed agricultural economic outcomes and accumulated ecological degradation both contributing to the decrease in total water extraction for irrigation the water allocation system also presented a strong negative correlation with the water environmental regulations implying that a decrease in water allocation for irrigation may also be influenced by the response of water environmental regulations to the observed ecological degradation the development of this socio hydrological model can assist in projecting future trajectories of the human water system s behaviour under changing scenarios although the simulation of the future socio economic and climatic scenarios is beyond the scope of this study it is expected that climate change will further negatively affect the study basin projecting a decrease in water resources availability meza et al 2014 also projections believed the population would continue increasing ine 2019 under this future scenario based on our model a slight decrease in water extractions for consumptive water uses would be expected but ecological degradation could be worsened due to climate change an increase in environmental regulations is expected however as learned from the past but it must be stronger synchronized and coordinated with water resources allocation decisions to revert the ecological degradation this study presents several limitations 1 catchment water balance could be improved with modelling tools that better capture the characteristics and processes of the basin 2 only the formal environmental regulations were considered while informal environmental governances were neglected 3 a simple ecological outcomes indicator was used and 4 potential additional drivers influencing the response of water resource allocation and water environmental regulations systems were neglected for the purpose of this study nevertheless

2349,flood disasters in coastal cities are generally caused by the combined effect of typhoon rainfall storm surge and other factors coastal cities will face more severe compound flooding under climate change although some studies have analyzed compound flooding under climate change there is a lack of research considering the combined effect of sea level rise slr and future rainfall changes especially lack of the jacking effect of slr on the volume and duration of compound flooding this paper investigates the impact of future rainfall changes and slr on compound flood risk via a case study of a coastal city haikou china future rainfall in haikou is obtained by bias correction of rainfall from five global climate models gcms in cmip5 the slr in 2050 and 2090 is predicted according to ipcc then a 1d 2d hydrological hydrodynamic model for dynamic simulation of surface runoff is applied to simulate compound flooding results show that both future rainfall changes and slr will lead to the increase of flood extent flood depth and flood duration but future rainfall changes will have a greater impact on flood and the combined effect of future rainfall changes and slr on flood is greater than the sum of their individual effects the individual effects of slr and future rainfall changes would increase flood depth in 10 6 and 32 1 of the study area respectively while their combined effect would increase this proportion to 34 9 also the jacking effect of slr on compound flooding will lead to an increase in flood volume but it presents a nonlinear relationship that gradually slows down with the increase of slr a slr of 0 3 m and 0 63 m will lead to a 2 34 and 3 22 increase in flood volume respectively and the jacking effect of slr is more obvious when future rainfall changes are considered which will lead to a sharp increase in the duration of compound flooding moreover water storage facilities and tidal gates are effective ways to reduce the impact of climate change on compound flooding keywords compound flooding climate change sea level rise future rainfall data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are considered as one of the most frequent and deadly natural disasters in the world hu et al 2018 li and zheng 2016 lian et al 2017 coastal cities are more at risk of floods due to exposure to multiple flood drivers such as extreme high tide storm surge extreme precipitation and high river flow when these flood driving factors coincide in space and time compound flood events will occur which will amplify the impact of floods and bring serious economic and property losses hemmati et al 2020 karamouz et al 2015 leonard et al 2014 zscheischler et al 2018 for example hurricane sandy 2012 and typhoon haiyan 2013 have brought large scale floods to coastal areas and caused huge losses of life and property mori et al 2014 strauss et al 2021 in coastal cities extreme rainfall and high tide levels are one of the causes of compound flooding jang and chang 2022 lian et al 2017 xu et al 2019 floods driven by extreme rainfall are drained into river channels and then into the sea when high tide conditions occur the jacking effect of the high tide will prevent urban flooding from being discharged into the sea through the drainage network reducing the drainage capacity of the coastal urban drainage network shen et al 2019 van den hurk et al 2015 wang et al 2012 therefore if heavy precipitation and high tide occur concurrently or in close succession the intensity of coastal urban floods will be greatly exacerbated wahl et al 2015 wu et al 2018 xu et al 2014 currently more than 600 million people around the world live in coastal areas and this number will increase to more than 1 billion by 2050 merkens et al 2016 in the context of global climate change and rapid population growth the impact of compound flooding on coastal cities will be amplified edmonds et al 2020 fang et al 2020 jongman et al 2012 moftakhari et al 2017 in recent years compound flooding has become a research hotspot and several studies have assessed the compound flood risk from the aspects of rainfall and storm surge storm surge and river flow and rainfall storm surge and river flow bevacqua et al 2017 ghanbari et al 2021 hendry et al 2019 leijnse et al 2021 loveland et al 2021 the research on compound flooding in coastal areas is mainly divided into statistical analysis and numerical simulation statistical analysis mainly refers to the analysis of correlation and joint probability among different flood driving factors ai et al 2018 bevacqua et al 2019 jane et al 2020 lu et al 2022 santos et al 2021 ward et al 2018 used kendall s rank correlation coefficient and copula models to analyze the dependence between high river discharge and high sea level in global delta regions xu et al 2019 analyzed the bivariate return period of storm surge and rainfall based on copula functions they found that storm surge and rainfall have obvious correlation and the joint return period will be significantly underestimated if this correlation is ignored xu et al 2022 calculated the joint probability between coastal peak water level and rainfall during historical tropical cyclones in shanghai based on copula function and identify the extent of shift in the joint distribution of rainfall and peak water level caused by relative slr since statistical analysis cannot obtain more accurate coastal flood results some studies rely on hydrodynamic models to simulate compound flooding bakhtyar et al 2020 couasnon et al 2018 hasan tanim and goharian 2021 liu et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 shen et al 2019 used a hydrodynamic model tuflow to simulate floods under a series of combined scenarios of storm surge and rainfall in norfolk usa and they found that even once in a year storm surge can have a noticeable effect on the capacity of drainage system qiang et al 2021 proposed an equivalent drainage method to replace the physical based drainage model and coupled with flo 2d model to simulate compound flooding in qianhai area of shenzhen shi et al 2022 took xiangshan china as an example simulated the compound flooding caused by storm surge and rainfall with swmm adcirc coupling model and analyzed the impact of coastal dams drainage systems and tidal gates on compound flooding global climate change has become the consensus of all countries in the world and has been proved to cause slr church et al 2013 jackson et al 2018 jevrejeva et al 2014 and extreme rainfall to increase li et al 2019 ndehedehe et al 2021 prein et al 2017 trenberth 2011 moreover there will be stronger coupling and compounding among various factors leading to flood disaster in coastal cities under climate change buchanan et al 2016 fang et al 2021 vahedifard et al 2016 which will cause more serious compound flood disasters recently a few studies have considered the impact of climate change on compound flooding moftakhari et al 2017 pasquier et al 2019 rahimi et al 2020 xu et al 2022 for example moftakhari et al 2017 quantified the increases in failure probabilities of coastal flood defenses for eight estuarine systems along the coasts of united states caused by slr in 2030 and 2050 based on copulas and bivariate dependence analysis čepienė et al 2022 used hec ras hydraulic model to model the impact of slr on compound flooding in the danė river caused by river discharge and klaipeda strait water level however most of these studies have only considered slr and the literature to assess future compound flood risk considering both slr and future rainfall changes is still scarce in 2020 park and lee 2020 assessed coastal flood risk probability of south korea under future rainfall changes and slr but it is difficult to obtain more accurate flood information to identify specific areas vulnerable to flood if only analyzing flood risk probability without numerical simulation of flood in addition most studies in the past investigated the impact of slr only by analyzing the changes of flood depth and flood extent bakhsh et al 2017 khanam et al 2021 wang et al 2018 jisan et al 2018 found that the extent of floods caused by storm surges in the coastal areas of bangladesh would increases by 31 when sea level rises by 0 26 m dutta 2011 analyzed the effect of slr on the inundated area caused by typical rainfall in bangkok thailand and their results showed that a sea level rise of 0 32 m would result in a 26 increase in the inundated area however slr will increase the jacking effect of the high tide on the drainage network and current researches cannot comprehensively understand the jacking effect of slr on compound flooding including the impact of slr on the duration and volume of coastal compound flooding therefore the primary objective of this paper is to assess the impact of climate change on compound flooding in coastal cities in this method we consider slr and future rainfall changes to analyze compound flooding in coastal cities under climate change and deeply investigate the jacking effect of slr on compound flooding we use the prediction data of gcms and ipcc to predict slr and future rainfall in haikou city and set up eight historical and future scenarios a hydrological hydraulic model is used to simulate the flood in each scenario according to the flood simulation results of different scenarios we comprehensively consider flood duration and flood depth to generate flood risk map this paper is organized as follows section 1 introduces the background purpose and methodology of this paper section 2 introduces the basic information of the study area section 3 introduces the method of this study the results of model calibration and validation and compound flood simulation results of different scenarios are analyzed in section 4 the content of this study is discussed in section 5 finally section 6 summarizes the conclusions 2 study area the study area haidian island is located at the north of haikou city and at the entrance of the nandu river fig 1 haidian island covers an area of about 14 km2 with a population of about 193 800 and an average elevation of 3 5 m it is the largest island in haikou and a typical delta island the island is surrounded by water and forms an independent drainage system the drainage system of haidian island is mainly composed of surface drainage channels and underground drainage pipe networks the water finally flows into the sea through drainage pipe networks and drainage channels haikou city is located on the northern edge of the low latitude tropics has a tropical ocean climate and is easily affected by typhoons the average annual rainfall in haikou is 1827 mm and the rainy season is from may to october while the dry season is from november to april of the following year the rainfall in dry season only accounts for about 22 of annual rainfall while the rainfall in rainy season accounts for 78 1 of annual rainfall data from the 14th five year plan for water safety and security in haikou and the rainy season is a period of frequent rainstorms in recent years due to global warming and slr the drainage system of haidian island has been adversely affected which has caused haidian island easy to experience seawater intrusion under high tide when encountering extreme weather such as typhoon the rainfall on the island is heavy and the demand for drainage is great under the combined effect of high tide and rainfall serious floods will occur in haidian island during the landing of typhoon ramasun in 2014 the area of water and power cut off in haikou exceeded 80 and resulting in direct economic losses of 11 95 billion yuan in hainan province wan et al 2016 3 methodology in this study future rainfall and slr are predicted and a numerical simulation model of urban waterlogging is used to simulate compound flooding in coastal cities under climate change the research methods mainly include the following parts 1 prediction of future climate change including future rainfall and slr 2 scenario setting determine the research scenario based on the historical and future data of rainfall and sea level 3 construction of numerical simulation model of urban waterlogging 4 flood risk assessment the framework of this research is shown in fig 2 abbreviations of the phrases used in this article and their full names are shown in table a1 3 1 climate change prediction the prediction of future climate change includes future rainfall prediction and slr prediction the rainfall prediction data of five gcms from 2051 to 2090 are used to obtain future daily rainfall under different return periods taking the annual highest sea level in 2006 as the benchmark the sea levels in 2050 and 2090 are determined based on the prediction of slr by ipcc ar5 and gcms 3 1 1 future rainfall the future rainfall data under climate change comes from the gcms in coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 according to hsiao et al 2021 five gcms including bcc csm1 1 hadgem2 cc mpi esm lr noresm1 m and ipsl cm5a mr are selected then future rainfall of the five gcms under representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 are analyzed based on the observed historical daily rainfall of haikou city the quantile mapping qm method is used to correct the deviation of future daily rainfall of haikou city predicted by gcms the qm method based on non parametric conversion to establish the transfer function is used in this study because the non parametric conversion method does not require assumptions on the original data and its applicability is more extensive tong et al 2017 then according to the future daily rainfall from 2051 to 2090 predicted by the five gcms the daily rainfall with return periods of 50 years 20 years 10 years and 5 years are calculated finally the daily rainfall of the five gcms in each return period under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 is averaged to determine the design rainfall for different return periods in the future 3 1 2 future sea level the prediction of future sea level comprehensively considers the forecast data of slr in ipcc ar5 ipcc 2014 and gcms three gcms bcc csm1 1 mpi esm lr and noresm1 m are selected to predict future slr under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the analysis of slr prediction results of the three gcms under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 shows that the average rate of slr from 2006 to 2100 is 2 2 mm year rcp 4 5 and 5 mm year rcp 8 5 according to the prediction of slr in ipcc ar5 compared with 1986 2005 the sea level may rise by 0 19 0 33 m rcp 4 5 and 0 22 0 38 m rcp 8 5 by 2046 2065 and the sea level may rise by 0 32 0 63 m rcp 4 5 and 0 45 0 82 m rcp 8 5 by 2081 2100 finally the slr prediction of gcms and ipcc ar5 are comprehensively considered to determine the sea levels in 2050 and 2090 3 2 scenario setting in this study eight scenarios are set up based on the prediction of future rainfall with 50 year return period and slr under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the historical daily rainfall under 50 year return period is obtained by analyzing historical observation rainfall data from 1970 to 2012 and the future daily rainfall under 50 year return period is obtained in section 3 1 1 the sea levels in 2050 and 2090 are obtained in section 3 1 2 combining the historical and future daily rainfall with the sea levels in 2006 2050 and 2090 eight scenarios are determined as shown in table 1 the eight scenarios include one historical scenario five future scenarios under rcp 8 5 and two future scenarios under rcp 4 5 hs06 is the historical scenario of the combination of historical daily rainfall and sea level in 2006 hs50 and hs90 are future scenarios of the combination of historical daily rainfall and sea level in 2050 and 2090 under rcp 8 5 fs06 fs50 and fs90 are future scenarios of the combination of future daily rainfall and sea level in 2006 2050 and 2090 under rcp 8 5 mfs50 and mfs90 are future scenarios of the combination of future daily rainfall and sea level in 2050 and 2090 under rcp 4 5 3 3 numerical simulation model the storm water management model swmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff simulation model developed by the united states environmental protection agency epa huber et al 2005 pcswmm is a commercial version of the swmm 5 0 model developed by computational hydraulics international chi which uses the same swmm engine for the modeling work pcswmm can dynamically simulate the rainfall runoff caused by rainstorm and solve the water quantity and water quality problems related to rainstorm runoff and includes the ability to import entity and attribute data from gis geographic information system formats as well as the coordinate systems for the desired location in this study pcswmm is used to build the numerical simulation model of waterlogging in the study area the construction of numerical simulation model includes the establishment of 1d model and the coupling of 1d model and 2d model the flow transmission of pcswmm in this study adopts the dynamic wave method and the governing equations of the pipe and channel include the continuity equation and momentum equation as follows 1 q x a t 0 2 ga h x q 2 a x q t g a s f g a h l 0 where q represents the flow rate a represents the cross sectional area of the water t represents time x represents the distance along the conduit h represents the pressure head g represents the gravitational acceleration sf represents the friction slope hl represents the local energy loss per unit length the continuity equation and momentum equation as shown in equations 1 and 2 respectively are solved by the successive approximation finite difference method 3 3 1 1d model construction the 1d model mainly refers to the construction of small drainage system including pipe networks pump stations and other facilities the basic layers that the 1d model needs to establish include sub catchment layer manhole layer pipeline layer including pipe networks and river channels drainage outlet layer and so on after constructing the 1d model the whole study area is divided into 13 sub catchment areas including 2087 1d inspection wells 2052 pipelines and 8 drainage outlets all the data needed for establishing the pipeline layer and inspection well layer come from the data obtained from the survey in 2013 the values of hydrodynamic parameters in the 1d model of haidian island such as slope and area of watershed and impervious rate of catchment area are obtained according to actual situation while the values of manning coefficient of impervious area overflow width of catchment area horton runoff parameter and other parameters can be obtained from relevant data 3 3 2 1d 2d model coupling in order to establish 1d 2d coupled flood simulation model it is necessary to add boundary layer 2d node layer 2d grid layer and dem layer based on the 1d model generally the number of 2d grids is below 100 000 and the resolution is above 3 m so the running time of the model will be short yu et al 2019 given this constraint the research area is divided into 23 580 grids the grid type is hexagonal grid and the resolution and roughness of the grid are set at 25 m and 0 085 there are two ways to couple 1d and 2d models in pcswmm bottom orifice connection and direct connection because the direct connection may have the problem of computational stability the bottom orifice connection is used to couple the 1d and 2d models in this study the flood numerical simulation model of haidian island is shown in fig 3 3 3 3 boundary condition setting in this study rainfall and high tide levels lasting 24 h are chosen as the boundary conditions to force the model to simulate compound flooding since extreme cases of flooding are often chosen as the basis for flood control in urban planning and moftakhari et al 2019 demonstrated that flood disasters with strong compound effects may be underestimated if the flood driving factors are assumed to be independent this paper assumes that extreme rainfall and high tide level storm events occur simultaneously the information on the process of the design tide level and design rainfall for haikou city is obtained from the haikou city urban flood control planning department the boundary conditions for compound flood simulation under the future scenario are obtained by amplifying the processes of rainfall and tide level for the baseline scenario based on the predictions of future rainfall and sea level rise fig 4 shows the boundary conditions of the compound flood simulation under the scenario hs06 baseline scenario 3 4 flood risk assessment the methods of urban flood risk assessment are mainly divided into three categories qualitative methods using risk matrices semi quantitative methods using indices and quantitative methods using scenario analysis yin et al 2015 in this study based on the flood numerical simulation results of haidian island under different scenarios the method of semi quantitative methods using indices is used to evaluate the flood risk two indices maximum flood depth and flood duration are selected to evaluate the flood risk in the study area multiply the result of maximum flood depth and flood duration of each location as a comprehensive index to divide the flood risk level as shown in equation 3 3 r d m d h where r is the flood risk value for each 2d grid m h dm is the max flood depth for each 2d grid m dh is the flood duration for each 2d grid h the natural fracture classification method is then used to classify the flood risk in the study area under scenario hs06 with reference to the risk classification criteria of scenario hs06 the study area is classified into five risk classes in this paper low risk sub low risk medium risk sub high risk and high risk table 2 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation of the numerical model the model is calibrated by using the data of rainfall tide level and flood records in haidian island during the super typhoon rammasun in 2014 super typhoon rammasun has a wide range of impacts causing serious loss of life and property to people in hainan province and guangdong province of china the data of rainfall and tide level are input into the numerical model to simulate flood the torrential rain in hainan island on october 5 2011 is adopted for validating the numerical model during the torrential rain the rainfall reached 311 5 mm and the highest tidal level reached 2 89 m three indicators including nse nash sutcliffe efficiency re relative error and r2 coefficient of determination are used to evaluate the performance of the model the values of nse re and r2 calculated according to the results of model calibration and validation are given in table 3 after calculation the simulated flood depths are in good agreement with the measured flood depth with r2 0 8 nse 0 7 and re 10 the accuracy of the model generally meets the requirements 4 2 future rainfall and slr future daily rainfall of different return periods under climate change is obtained according to the method in section 3 1 1 fig 5 shows future daily rainfall of five climate models in four return periods under rcp 4 5 scenario and rcp 8 5 scenario fig 6 shows the daily rainfall of four return periods under historical and future scenarios it can be seen from fig 6 that the future rainfall will increase obviously compared with the history the daily rainfall with a return period of 50 years under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios will increase by 3 and 14 respectively compared with the history according to the prediction method of future slr in section 3 1 2 it is predicted that the sea level will rise by 0 26 m rcp 4 5 and 0 30 m rcp 8 5 in 2050 and 0 47 m rcp 4 5 and 0 63 m rcp 8 5 in 2090 4 3 flood results under different scenarios the rainfall and tide level of the eight scenarios hs06 hs50 hs90 fs06 fs50 fs90 mfs50 and mfs90 are input into the numerical model of haidian island for flood simulation the compound flood simulation results of the study area under the scenarios hs06 hs90 fs06 and fs90 are displayed in fig 7 it can be clearly seen that floods will occur in most areas of the study area under these two scenarios the floods in the central southwest and eastern regions of the study area are more serious and the flood depth is significantly higher than other areas table 4 shows the variation of the percentage of area with flood depth greater than a certain value for the eight scenarios it can be seen that climate change increases the flood depth and expands the area with flood depths greater than a certain value 4 3 1 the jacking effect of slr on compound flooding flood results under historical scenarios and five rcp 8 5 scenarios are analyzed to assess the changes in flood volume caused by slr due to the jacking effect of slr the flood volume in scenarios hs50 and hs90 is 2 34 and 3 22 larger than that in hs06 and the flood volume in scenarios fs50 and fs90 is 8 65 and 10 70 larger than that in fs06 respectively this shows that the increase of rainfall in the future will amplify the jacking effect of slr which will lead to more obvious increase of flood volume in addition there is a gradually slowing nonlinear relationship between slr and the increase of jacking flood volume eight flood locations are selected in the study area fig 3 and the changes of flood duration at these eight locations under four scenarios are analyzed fig 8 shows the change curve of flood duration at the eight locations when flood depth is greater than a certain value under scenarios hs06 hs90 fs06 and fs90 as shown in fig 8 the jacking effect of slr at the locations a c f and g near the outfall will not only increase flood depth but also increase flood duration at the locations b d and e far from the outfall slr mainly affects flood duration at the same time more than half of the eight locations show that the role of slr under historical rainfall conditions is mainly responsible for increasing flood depth however when considering future rainfall changes the jacking effect of slr has a great influence on the duration of compound flooding taking the flood duration when the flood depth is greater than 0 15 m in the four scenarios as an example the flood duration of locations a b c d e f and h in scenarios hs06 hs90 and fs06 is basically the same but the flood duration is greatly increased in scenario fs90 which indicates that the jacking effect of slr on the duration of compound flooding will be exacerbated due to future rainfall changes 4 3 2 changes in flood extent flood depth and flood duration the flood results show that slr and future rainfall changes will increase the flood extent flood depth and flood duration due to slr the flood areas in the southwest and east of the study area gradually developed to coastal areas if the sea level continues to rise until 2090 the flood depth will be greatly increased compared with the scenario without slr for example when rainfall value keeps consistent the sea level in 2090 will increase the flood depth in 10 6 of the study area under historical rainfall slr will also significantly enlarge the area where flood duration is longer than 5 h the impact of future rainfall changes on compound floods is significantly greater than that of slr the flood extent in fs06 is 3 0 larger than that in hs06 and the proportion of the area where the flood depth in fs06 is higher than that in hs06 is 32 9 fig 9 shows that the areas where the flood duration is more than 15 h will obviously increase due to future rainfall changes flood results of future rainfall under different rcps are also different taking the flood results of historical and future rainfall in 2090 as an example the flood extent in mfs90 and fs90 increased by 1 5 and 3 9 respectively compared with hs90 the combined effect of future rainfall changes and slr on compound flooding is not a simple summation of the single effect of each factor it is significantly greater than the sum of their individual impacts under the future scenario fs90 more than 35 of the areas in the study area will be flooded which is 5 higher than the historical scenario as shown in table 5 and fig 9 the flood depth and flood duration in fs90 are also evidently greater than that in hs06 similarly future flood results under different rcps in the study area are different according to the flood results of four compound scenarios under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 it can be concluded that the combined effect of future rainfall and slr under rcp 8 5 will have a greater impact on compound flooding for example the flood extent in mfs50 is 32 4 while the flood extent in fs50 has increased to 34 7 4 3 3 flood risk map in this section the flood risk maps in each scenario are generated on basis of the maximum flood depth and flood duration fig 10 displays the map of maximum flood depth and flood duration in scenario hs06 fig 11 shows the flood risk maps under the eight scenarios according to the results of flood risk maps the area proportions of different flood risk levels under the eight scenarios are counted and the results are summarized in table 6 the flood risk maps show that the risk levels in the central western and eastern parts of the study area are relatively high and the risk levels in the southwest and eastern regions will increase to varying degrees under climate change according to table 6 slr and future rainfall changes will lead to a decrease in low risk areas and an increase in high risk areas the proportion of the sub low risk area medium risk area sub high risk area and high risk area in scenario fs90 under rcp 8 5 is the largest among the eight scenarios in addition comparing the results of scenarios mfs50 and mfs90 under rcp 4 5 with the results of scenarios fs50 and fs90 under rcp 8 5 the areas of the sub low risk area medium risk area sub high risk area and high risk area are obviously reduced this result indicates that if greenhouse gas emissions are effectively controlled in the future the increase of flood risk can be slowed down 4 4 assessment of mitigation measures for compound flooding based on the analysis results of this paper on compound flooding in coastal cities under climate change the role of setting water storage facilities and tidal gates in alleviating the compound flooding under climate change is evaluated in this part we set up two water storage facilities with an area of 5000 m2 in the study area and re simulated the future rainfall scenario the flood simulation results show that water storage facilities can significantly reduce flood depth and flood extent and the flood extent of future rainfall after adding water storage facilities is almost the same as that of historical rainfall this illustrates the importance of building water storage facilities in coastal cities to cope with the impact of future rainfall changes on floods the flood numerical simulation model established in this study is equipped with a tidal gate at the outfall we removed the tidal gate in the model and re run the historical slr scenario to analyze the effect of tidal gate on reducing the impact of slr on compound flooding the results show that flood extent and flood depth will be greatly increased due to slr when the tide gate is not installed and the flood extent will be increased by 18 which is only 0 6 when the tide gate is installed in the future coastal cities can reduce the impact of slr by installing tidal gates at outfalls 5 discussion this paper investigated the impact of slr and future rainfall changes on compound flooding in coastal cities under climate change a hydrological and hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the flood under historical and future scenarios we assessed the impact of future climate change on compound flooding from three aspects slr future rainfall changes and their combined effect and the jacking effect of slr on the volume and duration of compound flooding in coastal cities was also been deeply investigated we found that the impact of future rainfall changes on floods in the study area was greater than that of slr and their combined effect on compound flooding was greater than the sum of their individual effects and the flood volume increase caused by the jacking effect of slr is not a linear increase but will gradually slow down and the influence of slr on flood duration will be aggravated when considering future rainfall changes the ipcc ar5 proposes four rcp scenarios rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 this study adopts the forecast data of future rainfall and slr under rcp 4 5 scenario greenhouse gas emissions peak around 2040 and a decline in the rest of the century and rcp 8 5 scenario greenhouse gas emissions continuing to rise throughout the 21st century if greenhouse gas emissions are effectively controlled the actual values of future rainfall and slr may be lower than the predicted values under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios furthermore land subsidence is a problem faced by coastal cities which is not considered in the prediction of slr this paper analyzes the influence of climate change on compound flood risk in coastal cities which has reference value for coastal city floods research under climate change future research can further investigate future rainfall and sea level under other rcps to analyze their impact on compound flood disasters and use new methods to predict climate change moreover future research can comprehensively consider rainfall storm surge slr river flow land subsidence land use change and other factors to fully analyze compound flooding under climate change and environmental change 6 conclusions compound flooding cause serious loss of life and property in coastal areas and coastal areas will face more severe compound flood disasters under future climate change this paper took haikou city in china as an example to assess the impact of climate change on compound flooding in coastal cities in order to assess the impacts of future rainfall changes slr and different rcps on compound flooding under climate change we established eight research scenarios including one historical scenario and seven future scenarios then we utilized a hydrological and hydraulic model pcswmm to simulate compound flooding in historical and future scenarios five gcms were used to predict future rainfall of four return periods under different rcps the value of future slr was determined by comprehensively considering the prediction of slr by gcms and ipcc ar5 finally we combined the results of maximum flood depth and flood duration to generate the flood risk maps in the study area the results showed that rainfall and sea level would rise in the future which would significantly increase the compound flood risk of haidian island by analyzing the influence of slr and future rainfall changes on flood we found that future rainfall changes and slr would lead to the increase of the flood extent flood depth and flood duration but the impact of future rainfall changes on flood was greater than that of slr and under the combined effect of future rainfall changes and slr the flood extent flood depth and flood duration would increase significantly furthermore it could be found that the increase of future rainfall would promote the impact of slr on compound flooding and slr would also promote the impact of future rainfall changes on compound flooding by analyzing the simulated flood results under different rcps we also found that the impact of future rainfall changes and slr on compound flooding in rcp 8 5 scenario was higher than that in rcp 4 5 scenario in addition we deeply analyzed the impact of jacking effect caused by slr on compound flooding due to the jacking effect of slr the flood volume will obviously increase but show a nonlinear trend of gradually slowing down and the jacking effect of slr on flood duration is not obvious under historical rainfall conditions but will be amplified under future rainfall conditions we further discussed the role of water storage facilities and tide gates for coastal cities to cope with climate change and found that water storage facilities and tide gates were effectively ways to mitigate the impact of future rainfall changes and slr on the compound flooding climate change has become the consensus of all countries in the world and coastal areas need to take effective measures to deal with the adverse effects of climate change the results of this study indicate that coastal urban construction in the future should fully consider climate change and it is necessary to formulate new flood control standards credit authorship contribution statement kui xu conceptualization funding acquisition investigation methodology writing review editing yunchao zhuang

2349,flood disasters in coastal cities are generally caused by the combined effect of typhoon rainfall storm surge and other factors coastal cities will face more severe compound flooding under climate change although some studies have analyzed compound flooding under climate change there is a lack of research considering the combined effect of sea level rise slr and future rainfall changes especially lack of the jacking effect of slr on the volume and duration of compound flooding this paper investigates the impact of future rainfall changes and slr on compound flood risk via a case study of a coastal city haikou china future rainfall in haikou is obtained by bias correction of rainfall from five global climate models gcms in cmip5 the slr in 2050 and 2090 is predicted according to ipcc then a 1d 2d hydrological hydrodynamic model for dynamic simulation of surface runoff is applied to simulate compound flooding results show that both future rainfall changes and slr will lead to the increase of flood extent flood depth and flood duration but future rainfall changes will have a greater impact on flood and the combined effect of future rainfall changes and slr on flood is greater than the sum of their individual effects the individual effects of slr and future rainfall changes would increase flood depth in 10 6 and 32 1 of the study area respectively while their combined effect would increase this proportion to 34 9 also the jacking effect of slr on compound flooding will lead to an increase in flood volume but it presents a nonlinear relationship that gradually slows down with the increase of slr a slr of 0 3 m and 0 63 m will lead to a 2 34 and 3 22 increase in flood volume respectively and the jacking effect of slr is more obvious when future rainfall changes are considered which will lead to a sharp increase in the duration of compound flooding moreover water storage facilities and tidal gates are effective ways to reduce the impact of climate change on compound flooding keywords compound flooding climate change sea level rise future rainfall data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are considered as one of the most frequent and deadly natural disasters in the world hu et al 2018 li and zheng 2016 lian et al 2017 coastal cities are more at risk of floods due to exposure to multiple flood drivers such as extreme high tide storm surge extreme precipitation and high river flow when these flood driving factors coincide in space and time compound flood events will occur which will amplify the impact of floods and bring serious economic and property losses hemmati et al 2020 karamouz et al 2015 leonard et al 2014 zscheischler et al 2018 for example hurricane sandy 2012 and typhoon haiyan 2013 have brought large scale floods to coastal areas and caused huge losses of life and property mori et al 2014 strauss et al 2021 in coastal cities extreme rainfall and high tide levels are one of the causes of compound flooding jang and chang 2022 lian et al 2017 xu et al 2019 floods driven by extreme rainfall are drained into river channels and then into the sea when high tide conditions occur the jacking effect of the high tide will prevent urban flooding from being discharged into the sea through the drainage network reducing the drainage capacity of the coastal urban drainage network shen et al 2019 van den hurk et al 2015 wang et al 2012 therefore if heavy precipitation and high tide occur concurrently or in close succession the intensity of coastal urban floods will be greatly exacerbated wahl et al 2015 wu et al 2018 xu et al 2014 currently more than 600 million people around the world live in coastal areas and this number will increase to more than 1 billion by 2050 merkens et al 2016 in the context of global climate change and rapid population growth the impact of compound flooding on coastal cities will be amplified edmonds et al 2020 fang et al 2020 jongman et al 2012 moftakhari et al 2017 in recent years compound flooding has become a research hotspot and several studies have assessed the compound flood risk from the aspects of rainfall and storm surge storm surge and river flow and rainfall storm surge and river flow bevacqua et al 2017 ghanbari et al 2021 hendry et al 2019 leijnse et al 2021 loveland et al 2021 the research on compound flooding in coastal areas is mainly divided into statistical analysis and numerical simulation statistical analysis mainly refers to the analysis of correlation and joint probability among different flood driving factors ai et al 2018 bevacqua et al 2019 jane et al 2020 lu et al 2022 santos et al 2021 ward et al 2018 used kendall s rank correlation coefficient and copula models to analyze the dependence between high river discharge and high sea level in global delta regions xu et al 2019 analyzed the bivariate return period of storm surge and rainfall based on copula functions they found that storm surge and rainfall have obvious correlation and the joint return period will be significantly underestimated if this correlation is ignored xu et al 2022 calculated the joint probability between coastal peak water level and rainfall during historical tropical cyclones in shanghai based on copula function and identify the extent of shift in the joint distribution of rainfall and peak water level caused by relative slr since statistical analysis cannot obtain more accurate coastal flood results some studies rely on hydrodynamic models to simulate compound flooding bakhtyar et al 2020 couasnon et al 2018 hasan tanim and goharian 2021 liu et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 shen et al 2019 used a hydrodynamic model tuflow to simulate floods under a series of combined scenarios of storm surge and rainfall in norfolk usa and they found that even once in a year storm surge can have a noticeable effect on the capacity of drainage system qiang et al 2021 proposed an equivalent drainage method to replace the physical based drainage model and coupled with flo 2d model to simulate compound flooding in qianhai area of shenzhen shi et al 2022 took xiangshan china as an example simulated the compound flooding caused by storm surge and rainfall with swmm adcirc coupling model and analyzed the impact of coastal dams drainage systems and tidal gates on compound flooding global climate change has become the consensus of all countries in the world and has been proved to cause slr church et al 2013 jackson et al 2018 jevrejeva et al 2014 and extreme rainfall to increase li et al 2019 ndehedehe et al 2021 prein et al 2017 trenberth 2011 moreover there will be stronger coupling and compounding among various factors leading to flood disaster in coastal cities under climate change buchanan et al 2016 fang et al 2021 vahedifard et al 2016 which will cause more serious compound flood disasters recently a few studies have considered the impact of climate change on compound flooding moftakhari et al 2017 pasquier et al 2019 rahimi et al 2020 xu et al 2022 for example moftakhari et al 2017 quantified the increases in failure probabilities of coastal flood defenses for eight estuarine systems along the coasts of united states caused by slr in 2030 and 2050 based on copulas and bivariate dependence analysis čepienė et al 2022 used hec ras hydraulic model to model the impact of slr on compound flooding in the danė river caused by river discharge and klaipeda strait water level however most of these studies have only considered slr and the literature to assess future compound flood risk considering both slr and future rainfall changes is still scarce in 2020 park and lee 2020 assessed coastal flood risk probability of south korea under future rainfall changes and slr but it is difficult to obtain more accurate flood information to identify specific areas vulnerable to flood if only analyzing flood risk probability without numerical simulation of flood in addition most studies in the past investigated the impact of slr only by analyzing the changes of flood depth and flood extent bakhsh et al 2017 khanam et al 2021 wang et al 2018 jisan et al 2018 found that the extent of floods caused by storm surges in the coastal areas of bangladesh would increases by 31 when sea level rises by 0 26 m dutta 2011 analyzed the effect of slr on the inundated area caused by typical rainfall in bangkok thailand and their results showed that a sea level rise of 0 32 m would result in a 26 increase in the inundated area however slr will increase the jacking effect of the high tide on the drainage network and current researches cannot comprehensively understand the jacking effect of slr on compound flooding including the impact of slr on the duration and volume of coastal compound flooding therefore the primary objective of this paper is to assess the impact of climate change on compound flooding in coastal cities in this method we consider slr and future rainfall changes to analyze compound flooding in coastal cities under climate change and deeply investigate the jacking effect of slr on compound flooding we use the prediction data of gcms and ipcc to predict slr and future rainfall in haikou city and set up eight historical and future scenarios a hydrological hydraulic model is used to simulate the flood in each scenario according to the flood simulation results of different scenarios we comprehensively consider flood duration and flood depth to generate flood risk map this paper is organized as follows section 1 introduces the background purpose and methodology of this paper section 2 introduces the basic information of the study area section 3 introduces the method of this study the results of model calibration and validation and compound flood simulation results of different scenarios are analyzed in section 4 the content of this study is discussed in section 5 finally section 6 summarizes the conclusions 2 study area the study area haidian island is located at the north of haikou city and at the entrance of the nandu river fig 1 haidian island covers an area of about 14 km2 with a population of about 193 800 and an average elevation of 3 5 m it is the largest island in haikou and a typical delta island the island is surrounded by water and forms an independent drainage system the drainage system of haidian island is mainly composed of surface drainage channels and underground drainage pipe networks the water finally flows into the sea through drainage pipe networks and drainage channels haikou city is located on the northern edge of the low latitude tropics has a tropical ocean climate and is easily affected by typhoons the average annual rainfall in haikou is 1827 mm and the rainy season is from may to october while the dry season is from november to april of the following year the rainfall in dry season only accounts for about 22 of annual rainfall while the rainfall in rainy season accounts for 78 1 of annual rainfall data from the 14th five year plan for water safety and security in haikou and the rainy season is a period of frequent rainstorms in recent years due to global warming and slr the drainage system of haidian island has been adversely affected which has caused haidian island easy to experience seawater intrusion under high tide when encountering extreme weather such as typhoon the rainfall on the island is heavy and the demand for drainage is great under the combined effect of high tide and rainfall serious floods will occur in haidian island during the landing of typhoon ramasun in 2014 the area of water and power cut off in haikou exceeded 80 and resulting in direct economic losses of 11 95 billion yuan in hainan province wan et al 2016 3 methodology in this study future rainfall and slr are predicted and a numerical simulation model of urban waterlogging is used to simulate compound flooding in coastal cities under climate change the research methods mainly include the following parts 1 prediction of future climate change including future rainfall and slr 2 scenario setting determine the research scenario based on the historical and future data of rainfall and sea level 3 construction of numerical simulation model of urban waterlogging 4 flood risk assessment the framework of this research is shown in fig 2 abbreviations of the phrases used in this article and their full names are shown in table a1 3 1 climate change prediction the prediction of future climate change includes future rainfall prediction and slr prediction the rainfall prediction data of five gcms from 2051 to 2090 are used to obtain future daily rainfall under different return periods taking the annual highest sea level in 2006 as the benchmark the sea levels in 2050 and 2090 are determined based on the prediction of slr by ipcc ar5 and gcms 3 1 1 future rainfall the future rainfall data under climate change comes from the gcms in coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 according to hsiao et al 2021 five gcms including bcc csm1 1 hadgem2 cc mpi esm lr noresm1 m and ipsl cm5a mr are selected then future rainfall of the five gcms under representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 are analyzed based on the observed historical daily rainfall of haikou city the quantile mapping qm method is used to correct the deviation of future daily rainfall of haikou city predicted by gcms the qm method based on non parametric conversion to establish the transfer function is used in this study because the non parametric conversion method does not require assumptions on the original data and its applicability is more extensive tong et al 2017 then according to the future daily rainfall from 2051 to 2090 predicted by the five gcms the daily rainfall with return periods of 50 years 20 years 10 years and 5 years are calculated finally the daily rainfall of the five gcms in each return period under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 is averaged to determine the design rainfall for different return periods in the future 3 1 2 future sea level the prediction of future sea level comprehensively considers the forecast data of slr in ipcc ar5 ipcc 2014 and gcms three gcms bcc csm1 1 mpi esm lr and noresm1 m are selected to predict future slr under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the analysis of slr prediction results of the three gcms under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 shows that the average rate of slr from 2006 to 2100 is 2 2 mm year rcp 4 5 and 5 mm year rcp 8 5 according to the prediction of slr in ipcc ar5 compared with 1986 2005 the sea level may rise by 0 19 0 33 m rcp 4 5 and 0 22 0 38 m rcp 8 5 by 2046 2065 and the sea level may rise by 0 32 0 63 m rcp 4 5 and 0 45 0 82 m rcp 8 5 by 2081 2100 finally the slr prediction of gcms and ipcc ar5 are comprehensively considered to determine the sea levels in 2050 and 2090 3 2 scenario setting in this study eight scenarios are set up based on the prediction of future rainfall with 50 year return period and slr under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the historical daily rainfall under 50 year return period is obtained by analyzing historical observation rainfall data from 1970 to 2012 and the future daily rainfall under 50 year return period is obtained in section 3 1 1 the sea levels in 2050 and 2090 are obtained in section 3 1 2 combining the historical and future daily rainfall with the sea levels in 2006 2050 and 2090 eight scenarios are determined as shown in table 1 the eight scenarios include one historical scenario five future scenarios under rcp 8 5 and two future scenarios under rcp 4 5 hs06 is the historical scenario of the combination of historical daily rainfall and sea level in 2006 hs50 and hs90 are future scenarios of the combination of historical daily rainfall and sea level in 2050 and 2090 under rcp 8 5 fs06 fs50 and fs90 are future scenarios of the combination of future daily rainfall and sea level in 2006 2050 and 2090 under rcp 8 5 mfs50 and mfs90 are future scenarios of the combination of future daily rainfall and sea level in 2050 and 2090 under rcp 4 5 3 3 numerical simulation model the storm water management model swmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff simulation model developed by the united states environmental protection agency epa huber et al 2005 pcswmm is a commercial version of the swmm 5 0 model developed by computational hydraulics international chi which uses the same swmm engine for the modeling work pcswmm can dynamically simulate the rainfall runoff caused by rainstorm and solve the water quantity and water quality problems related to rainstorm runoff and includes the ability to import entity and attribute data from gis geographic information system formats as well as the coordinate systems for the desired location in this study pcswmm is used to build the numerical simulation model of waterlogging in the study area the construction of numerical simulation model includes the establishment of 1d model and the coupling of 1d model and 2d model the flow transmission of pcswmm in this study adopts the dynamic wave method and the governing equations of the pipe and channel include the continuity equation and momentum equation as follows 1 q x a t 0 2 ga h x q 2 a x q t g a s f g a h l 0 where q represents the flow rate a represents the cross sectional area of the water t represents time x represents the distance along the conduit h represents the pressure head g represents the gravitational acceleration sf represents the friction slope hl represents the local energy loss per unit length the continuity equation and momentum equation as shown in equations 1 and 2 respectively are solved by the successive approximation finite difference method 3 3 1 1d model construction the 1d model mainly refers to the construction of small drainage system including pipe networks pump stations and other facilities the basic layers that the 1d model needs to establish include sub catchment layer manhole layer pipeline layer including pipe networks and river channels drainage outlet layer and so on after constructing the 1d model the whole study area is divided into 13 sub catchment areas including 2087 1d inspection wells 2052 pipelines and 8 drainage outlets all the data needed for establishing the pipeline layer and inspection well layer come from the data obtained from the survey in 2013 the values of hydrodynamic parameters in the 1d model of haidian island such as slope and area of watershed and impervious rate of catchment area are obtained according to actual situation while the values of manning coefficient of impervious area overflow width of catchment area horton runoff parameter and other parameters can be obtained from relevant data 3 3 2 1d 2d model coupling in order to establish 1d 2d coupled flood simulation model it is necessary to add boundary layer 2d node layer 2d grid layer and dem layer based on the 1d model generally the number of 2d grids is below 100 000 and the resolution is above 3 m so the running time of the model will be short yu et al 2019 given this constraint the research area is divided into 23 580 grids the grid type is hexagonal grid and the resolution and roughness of the grid are set at 25 m and 0 085 there are two ways to couple 1d and 2d models in pcswmm bottom orifice connection and direct connection because the direct connection may have the problem of computational stability the bottom orifice connection is used to couple the 1d and 2d models in this study the flood numerical simulation model of haidian island is shown in fig 3 3 3 3 boundary condition setting in this study rainfall and high tide levels lasting 24 h are chosen as the boundary conditions to force the model to simulate compound flooding since extreme cases of flooding are often chosen as the basis for flood control in urban planning and moftakhari et al 2019 demonstrated that flood disasters with strong compound effects may be underestimated if the flood driving factors are assumed to be independent this paper assumes that extreme rainfall and high tide level storm events occur simultaneously the information on the process of the design tide level and design rainfall for haikou city is obtained from the haikou city urban flood control planning department the boundary conditions for compound flood simulation under the future scenario are obtained by amplifying the processes of rainfall and tide level for the baseline scenario based on the predictions of future rainfall and sea level rise fig 4 shows the boundary conditions of the compound flood simulation under the scenario hs06 baseline scenario 3 4 flood risk assessment the methods of urban flood risk assessment are mainly divided into three categories qualitative methods using risk matrices semi quantitative methods using indices and quantitative methods using scenario analysis yin et al 2015 in this study based on the flood numerical simulation results of haidian island under different scenarios the method of semi quantitative methods using indices is used to evaluate the flood risk two indices maximum flood depth and flood duration are selected to evaluate the flood risk in the study area multiply the result of maximum flood depth and flood duration of each location as a comprehensive index to divide the flood risk level as shown in equation 3 3 r d m d h where r is the flood risk value for each 2d grid m h dm is the max flood depth for each 2d grid m dh is the flood duration for each 2d grid h the natural fracture classification method is then used to classify the flood risk in the study area under scenario hs06 with reference to the risk classification criteria of scenario hs06 the study area is classified into five risk classes in this paper low risk sub low risk medium risk sub high risk and high risk table 2 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation of the numerical model the model is calibrated by using the data of rainfall tide level and flood records in haidian island during the super typhoon rammasun in 2014 super typhoon rammasun has a wide range of impacts causing serious loss of life and property to people in hainan province and guangdong province of china the data of rainfall and tide level are input into the numerical model to simulate flood the torrential rain in hainan island on october 5 2011 is adopted for validating the numerical model during the torrential rain the rainfall reached 311 5 mm and the highest tidal level reached 2 89 m three indicators including nse nash sutcliffe efficiency re relative error and r2 coefficient of determination are used to evaluate the performance of the model the values of nse re and r2 calculated according to the results of model calibration and validation are given in table 3 after calculation the simulated flood depths are in good agreement with the measured flood depth with r2 0 8 nse 0 7 and re 10 the accuracy of the model generally meets the requirements 4 2 future rainfall and slr future daily rainfall of different return periods under climate change is obtained according to the method in section 3 1 1 fig 5 shows future daily rainfall of five climate models in four return periods under rcp 4 5 scenario and rcp 8 5 scenario fig 6 shows the daily rainfall of four return periods under historical and future scenarios it can be seen from fig 6 that the future rainfall will increase obviously compared with the history the daily rainfall with a return period of 50 years under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios will increase by 3 and 14 respectively compared with the history according to the prediction method of future slr in section 3 1 2 it is predicted that the sea level will rise by 0 26 m rcp 4 5 and 0 30 m rcp 8 5 in 2050 and 0 47 m rcp 4 5 and 0 63 m rcp 8 5 in 2090 4 3 flood results under different scenarios the rainfall and tide level of the eight scenarios hs06 hs50 hs90 fs06 fs50 fs90 mfs50 and mfs90 are input into the numerical model of haidian island for flood simulation the compound flood simulation results of the study area under the scenarios hs06 hs90 fs06 and fs90 are displayed in fig 7 it can be clearly seen that floods will occur in most areas of the study area under these two scenarios the floods in the central southwest and eastern regions of the study area are more serious and the flood depth is significantly higher than other areas table 4 shows the variation of the percentage of area with flood depth greater than a certain value for the eight scenarios it can be seen that climate change increases the flood depth and expands the area with flood depths greater than a certain value 4 3 1 the jacking effect of slr on compound flooding flood results under historical scenarios and five rcp 8 5 scenarios are analyzed to assess the changes in flood volume caused by slr due to the jacking effect of slr the flood volume in scenarios hs50 and hs90 is 2 34 and 3 22 larger than that in hs06 and the flood volume in scenarios fs50 and fs90 is 8 65 and 10 70 larger than that in fs06 respectively this shows that the increase of rainfall in the future will amplify the jacking effect of slr which will lead to more obvious increase of flood volume in addition there is a gradually slowing nonlinear relationship between slr and the increase of jacking flood volume eight flood locations are selected in the study area fig 3 and the changes of flood duration at these eight locations under four scenarios are analyzed fig 8 shows the change curve of flood duration at the eight locations when flood depth is greater than a certain value under scenarios hs06 hs90 fs06 and fs90 as shown in fig 8 the jacking effect of slr at the locations a c f and g near the outfall will not only increase flood depth but also increase flood duration at the locations b d and e far from the outfall slr mainly affects flood duration at the same time more than half of the eight locations show that the role of slr under historical rainfall conditions is mainly responsible for increasing flood depth however when considering future rainfall changes the jacking effect of slr has a great influence on the duration of compound flooding taking the flood duration when the flood depth is greater than 0 15 m in the four scenarios as an example the flood duration of locations a b c d e f and h in scenarios hs06 hs90 and fs06 is basically the same but the flood duration is greatly increased in scenario fs90 which indicates that the jacking effect of slr on the duration of compound flooding will be exacerbated due to future rainfall changes 4 3 2 changes in flood extent flood depth and flood duration the flood results show that slr and future rainfall changes will increase the flood extent flood depth and flood duration due to slr the flood areas in the southwest and east of the study area gradually developed to coastal areas if the sea level continues to rise until 2090 the flood depth will be greatly increased compared with the scenario without slr for example when rainfall value keeps consistent the sea level in 2090 will increase the flood depth in 10 6 of the study area under historical rainfall slr will also significantly enlarge the area where flood duration is longer than 5 h the impact of future rainfall changes on compound floods is significantly greater than that of slr the flood extent in fs06 is 3 0 larger than that in hs06 and the proportion of the area where the flood depth in fs06 is higher than that in hs06 is 32 9 fig 9 shows that the areas where the flood duration is more than 15 h will obviously increase due to future rainfall changes flood results of future rainfall under different rcps are also different taking the flood results of historical and future rainfall in 2090 as an example the flood extent in mfs90 and fs90 increased by 1 5 and 3 9 respectively compared with hs90 the combined effect of future rainfall changes and slr on compound flooding is not a simple summation of the single effect of each factor it is significantly greater than the sum of their individual impacts under the future scenario fs90 more than 35 of the areas in the study area will be flooded which is 5 higher than the historical scenario as shown in table 5 and fig 9 the flood depth and flood duration in fs90 are also evidently greater than that in hs06 similarly future flood results under different rcps in the study area are different according to the flood results of four compound scenarios under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 it can be concluded that the combined effect of future rainfall and slr under rcp 8 5 will have a greater impact on compound flooding for example the flood extent in mfs50 is 32 4 while the flood extent in fs50 has increased to 34 7 4 3 3 flood risk map in this section the flood risk maps in each scenario are generated on basis of the maximum flood depth and flood duration fig 10 displays the map of maximum flood depth and flood duration in scenario hs06 fig 11 shows the flood risk maps under the eight scenarios according to the results of flood risk maps the area proportions of different flood risk levels under the eight scenarios are counted and the results are summarized in table 6 the flood risk maps show that the risk levels in the central western and eastern parts of the study area are relatively high and the risk levels in the southwest and eastern regions will increase to varying degrees under climate change according to table 6 slr and future rainfall changes will lead to a decrease in low risk areas and an increase in high risk areas the proportion of the sub low risk area medium risk area sub high risk area and high risk area in scenario fs90 under rcp 8 5 is the largest among the eight scenarios in addition comparing the results of scenarios mfs50 and mfs90 under rcp 4 5 with the results of scenarios fs50 and fs90 under rcp 8 5 the areas of the sub low risk area medium risk area sub high risk area and high risk area are obviously reduced this result indicates that if greenhouse gas emissions are effectively controlled in the future the increase of flood risk can be slowed down 4 4 assessment of mitigation measures for compound flooding based on the analysis results of this paper on compound flooding in coastal cities under climate change the role of setting water storage facilities and tidal gates in alleviating the compound flooding under climate change is evaluated in this part we set up two water storage facilities with an area of 5000 m2 in the study area and re simulated the future rainfall scenario the flood simulation results show that water storage facilities can significantly reduce flood depth and flood extent and the flood extent of future rainfall after adding water storage facilities is almost the same as that of historical rainfall this illustrates the importance of building water storage facilities in coastal cities to cope with the impact of future rainfall changes on floods the flood numerical simulation model established in this study is equipped with a tidal gate at the outfall we removed the tidal gate in the model and re run the historical slr scenario to analyze the effect of tidal gate on reducing the impact of slr on compound flooding the results show that flood extent and flood depth will be greatly increased due to slr when the tide gate is not installed and the flood extent will be increased by 18 which is only 0 6 when the tide gate is installed in the future coastal cities can reduce the impact of slr by installing tidal gates at outfalls 5 discussion this paper investigated the impact of slr and future rainfall changes on compound flooding in coastal cities under climate change a hydrological and hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the flood under historical and future scenarios we assessed the impact of future climate change on compound flooding from three aspects slr future rainfall changes and their combined effect and the jacking effect of slr on the volume and duration of compound flooding in coastal cities was also been deeply investigated we found that the impact of future rainfall changes on floods in the study area was greater than that of slr and their combined effect on compound flooding was greater than the sum of their individual effects and the flood volume increase caused by the jacking effect of slr is not a linear increase but will gradually slow down and the influence of slr on flood duration will be aggravated when considering future rainfall changes the ipcc ar5 proposes four rcp scenarios rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 this study adopts the forecast data of future rainfall and slr under rcp 4 5 scenario greenhouse gas emissions peak around 2040 and a decline in the rest of the century and rcp 8 5 scenario greenhouse gas emissions continuing to rise throughout the 21st century if greenhouse gas emissions are effectively controlled the actual values of future rainfall and slr may be lower than the predicted values under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios furthermore land subsidence is a problem faced by coastal cities which is not considered in the prediction of slr this paper analyzes the influence of climate change on compound flood risk in coastal cities which has reference value for coastal city floods research under climate change future research can further investigate future rainfall and sea level under other rcps to analyze their impact on compound flood disasters and use new methods to predict climate change moreover future research can comprehensively consider rainfall storm surge slr river flow land subsidence land use change and other factors to fully analyze compound flooding under climate change and environmental change 6 conclusions compound flooding cause serious loss of life and property in coastal areas and coastal areas will face more severe compound flood disasters under future climate change this paper took haikou city in china as an example to assess the impact of climate change on compound flooding in coastal cities in order to assess the impacts of future rainfall changes slr and different rcps on compound flooding under climate change we established eight research scenarios including one historical scenario and seven future scenarios then we utilized a hydrological and hydraulic model pcswmm to simulate compound flooding in historical and future scenarios five gcms were used to predict future rainfall of four return periods under different rcps the value of future slr was determined by comprehensively considering the prediction of slr by gcms and ipcc ar5 finally we combined the results of maximum flood depth and flood duration to generate the flood risk maps in the study area the results showed that rainfall and sea level would rise in the future which would significantly increase the compound flood risk of haidian island by analyzing the influence of slr and future rainfall changes on flood we found that future rainfall changes and slr would lead to the increase of the flood extent flood depth and flood duration but the impact of future rainfall changes on flood was greater than that of slr and under the combined effect of future rainfall changes and slr the flood extent flood depth and flood duration would increase significantly furthermore it could be found that the increase of future rainfall would promote the impact of slr on compound flooding and slr would also promote the impact of future rainfall changes on compound flooding by analyzing the simulated flood results under different rcps we also found that the impact of future rainfall changes and slr on compound flooding in rcp 8 5 scenario was higher than that in rcp 4 5 scenario in addition we deeply analyzed the impact of jacking effect caused by slr on compound flooding due to the jacking effect of slr the flood volume will obviously increase but show a nonlinear trend of gradually slowing down and the jacking effect of slr on flood duration is not obvious under historical rainfall conditions but will be amplified under future rainfall conditions we further discussed the role of water storage facilities and tide gates for coastal cities to cope with climate change and found that water storage facilities and tide gates were effectively ways to mitigate the impact of future rainfall changes and slr on the compound flooding climate change has become the consensus of all countries in the world and coastal areas need to take effective measures to deal with the adverse effects of climate change the results of this study indicate that coastal urban construction in the future should fully consider climate change and it is necessary to formulate new flood control standards credit authorship contribution statement kui xu conceptualization funding acquisition investigation methodology writing review editing yunchao zhuang
