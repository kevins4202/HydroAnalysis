9550,this study examines the effects of irrigation water use efficiency improvements and citrus price fluctuations on water values in the tree production systems of northeastern tunisia it also aims to compare water values with the real price of water as currently paid by farmers and determine the optimal price cross sectional data of a selected sample of 42 citrus farms located in the main producing region of this commodity was used for the analysis to do so we used the stochastic frontier production function approach empirical findings show that significant inefficiencies do exist in the studied sample of farms overall mean technical efficiency and water use efficiency are 78 4 and 44 3 respectively based on these values simulation analysis indicates that an improvement in water use efficiency combined with an increase in citrus prices could shift the water marginal value curve upwards which will result in higher water valuation results also show that the current water price paid by farmers is much lower than the water value estimated at the level of theoretical citrus irrigation requirements application of higher irrigation water fees is definitely feasible for the studied production system however they need to be accompanied by increased incentives for water use efficiency in addition to better market integration of farmers keywords citrus tunisia water irrigation value water pricing water use efficiency 1 introduction tunisia is currently facing increased water scarcity limited supply of water resources and increased competition over water among various sectors mainly industry domestic and agriculture over 75 of the available fresh water in tunisia is used for irrigation irrigated areas cover around 1 1 1tnd 0 36 usd 2019 460 000 ha which is around 8 of the total agricultural area of the country ma 2018 irrigated areas also contribute up to 35 of the value of national agricultural production 20 of agricultural exports and 27 of agricultural employment dhehibi et al 2014 however climate change is expected to increase water scarcity and substantially reducing irrigation water availability within this context of water scarcity improvement of crop water productivity becomes very urgent in fact several economic studies on the use of irrigation water in tunisia show that it is possible to improve water use efficiency wue without necessarily introducing new technology dhehibi et al 2007 frija et al 2009 chemak 2012 chebil et al 2012 2013 chemak et al 2018 in general some studies in the literature dealing with irrigation water values have attempted to compare these values between crops or regions or irrigation systems yigezu et al 2013 shen and lin 2017 bierkens et al 2019 despite the importance of information about water irrigation value only few studies have been carried out to analyse the value of irrigation water in tunisia frija et al 2014 chouchane et al 2015 chebil and frija 2016 souissi et al 2019 none of the previous studies tackled the relationship between water value and water pricing however to our knowledge this is the first study in tunisia attempting to estimate the optimal water price based on the water value at the level of citrus irrigation requirements considered here as a case study for illustrating this methodology this information on water valuation in the different production systems is useful and would be considered as a criterion for irrigation water pricing furthermore in absence of knowledge about marginal water values we cannot know if there is a room to increase water price and that s the gap we are trying to fill this study takes a step forward by examining the scope and impact of wue improvements in addition to the increase of agricultural commodity output prices on water valuation it also aims to compare water values resulting from both scenarios with the real price of water as currently paid by farmers in the selected farming system this helps water managers to determine users ability to pay for irrigation water in a given agricultural production system to this end a stochastic frontier production function approach sfa will be performed based on data from a selected sample of 42 farms located in the main citrus producing region of tunisia cap bon this northeastern region of tunisia is located in the semi arid bioclimatic area and is facing growing problems of water scarcity due to the existence of large urban and touristic agglomerations water transfer from the north medjerda river of the country represents the main water source for the irrigation of the cap bon region citrus is one of the major tree species cultivated under irrigation in tunisia and represents about 10 of total irrigated fruit tree areas and is also ranked as being the fourth agricultural commodity in terms of export value about 73 of the citrus area in tunisia is located in this cap bon region ma 2018 2 conceptual framework economic efficiency value and pricing of irrigation water technical efficiency te is defined as the farm s ability to produce the maximum amount of output given a set of inputs output oriented or produce a given level of output using a minimum level of inputs input oriented allocative efficiency ae arises when the input mix is consistent with cost minimization it occurs when the value of the marginal product of each input equals its unitary cost farrell 1957 omezzine and zaibet 1998 liefert et al 2003 ogundari 2008 marginal value product is obtained when slope of production function is equal to the slope of the iso profit line which is the ratio of the price of the factor inputs to the price of output px py yotopoulos and lau 1973 kalirajan and obwona 2004 ogundari 2008 a farm is said to be economically efficient ee if it is both technically and allocatively efficient fig 1 depicts technical and allocative inefficiencies using output y and a single input water in our case to illustrate the situation of efficiency and inefficiency farms we depict two curves f and f it is clear that f displays higher output for a given level of production input a farmer operating at f is more efficient technically that a farmer operating on f the production frontier for a farm using best practice techniques efficient situation is shown by frontier f at points b and c the farms are technically efficient since they operate on the frontier f a farm that operates at point c on the frontier f uses w level of water and receives profit max π c where the iso profit line is tangent to its production frontier is economically efficient on the other hand the farm at point b on the frontier f uses wi level of water and receives lower profits π b than farm c this profit loss is due to allocative inefficiencies chebil and frija 2016 however farm a is neither allocative nor te it operates at the curve f of inefficient farms the curves of marginal water value mwv for efficient water use mwvtec and inefficient water use mwvintec are illustrated in fig 1 the difference between the mwv in the two situations is equal to the loss of water value associated with technical inefficiency however the allocative inefficiency is given by the difference between the mwv and the water price chebil and frija 2016 3 methodology 3 1 technical and water use efficiencies in this study we use the sfa as proposed by aigner et al 1977 to estimate te and wue scores of farms the sfa incorporates in the deterministic function the error term that accounts for the statistical noise the composite error term includes a random error and inefficiency terms according to karagiannis et al 2003 the methodological framework of technology to estimate wue is described by the following sfa 1 yi f xi wi a exp εi vi ui where yi denotes the output produced by the ith farm x is a vector of input quantities used wi is irrigation water a is a parameter and εi is a composite error term ui represents the inefficiency component and is assumed to be independently distributed such that ui follows a truncated at zero u i 0 normal distribution n 0 σ u 2 while the term vi a symmetrical two sided random error assumed to be independently and identically distributed n 0 σ v 2 is associated with random factors beyond the control of the farmer measurement errors weather diseases it is assumed that the two error components u and v are independent of each other then farm specific estimates of output oriented te are obtained as t e i 0 exp u i kumbhakar and lovell 2000 while farm specific estimates of input oriented te are derived by equation 1 with yi f ʋixi ʋiwi α exp vi and solving for tei i ʋi atkinson and cornwell 1994 reinhard et al 1999 thus tei 0 is greater equal or less than tei i whenever returns to scale are decreasing constant or increasing respectively färe and lovell 1978 however the above measures of efficiency are not appropriate to compute the input specific efficiency kopp 1981 proposed an input specific te measure based on the non radial notion it is specifically defined as the ratio of minimum feasible to observed use of irrigation water conditional on the production technology and the observed levels of outputs and inputs thus wue is an input oriented single factor measure of te defined as 2 wuei min λ f x λ w a y 0 1 wue as defined in 2 has an input conserving interpretation which however cannot be converted into a cost saving measure due to its non radial nature kopp 1981 the measure of wue proposed by karagiannis et al 2003 is presented in fig 2 let the ith inefficient farmer producing output y0 by using x1 of all other inputs and w1 units of irrigation water then tei i ob oa and wuei i x1c x1a w2 w1 the suggested wue measure estimates both the minimum feasible water use w2 and the potential for water reduction w1 w2 that still permits the production of y0 with the unaltered use of all other inputs on the other hand according to the tei i measure the maximum possible reduction in water use required to make the ith farm technically efficient is w1 w3 from fig 2 it is clear that the former w1 w2 will always be greater than the latter w1 w3 consequently the maximum possible reduction in water use suggested by wuei i should be considered as an upper bound akridge 1989 conceptually measurement of wuei 1 requires an estimate for the quantity w2 which is not observed nevertheless using wuei i w2 w1 it can easily be seen that w2 w1wuei i by substituting this into 1 and by noticing that point c in fig 2 lies on the frontier i e ui 0 3 may be rewritten as 3 yi f xi wi e a exp ui where wi e w2 reinhard et al 1999 then a measure of wuei i can be obtained by equating 1 with 3 and by using the econometrically estimated parameter a for more details see reinhard et al 1999 and karagiannis et al 2003 in these models f is a suitable functional form for the frontier generally translog or cobb douglas 4 c o b b d o u g l a s s c d f u n

specification for the production function cd or translog for the given data set we conducted hypothesis tests for the parameters of the stochastic production frontier model using the generalized likelihood ratio statistic lr defined by 6 l r 2 ln l h 0 l h 1 where l h0 is the value of the likelihood function of the cd stochastic production frontier model in which the parameter restrictions specified by the null hypothesis h0 β jk 0 i e the coefficient on the squared and interaction terms of input variables are zero are imposed l h1 is the value of the likelihood function for the full translog stochastic production frontier model where the coefficient of the squared and interaction terms of input variables are not zero if the null hypothesis is true then lr has approximately a chi square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference between the number of parameters estimated under h1 and h0 respectively 3 2 value of irrigation water water and other inputs and production value are used as data for econometric agricultural production function analysis the relationship between inputs and output of crop production can be expressed mathematically through what is called a production function if the dependent variable used in the empirical analysis is the output value the mwv can be calculated from the estimated eqs 4 and 5 as follows 7 m w v y w mwv can also be easily calculated directly by multiplying the output elasticity for water by the average output of water or economic water productivity 8 m w v ε y w y w where y q p denotes the value of output q is the output quantity p is the output price and ɛ y w is the output elasticity for water in order to address the issue of noise we used the observed output adjusted for the statistical noise

the data used for this study was collected in 2015 from a sample of 42 citrus farmers located in the cap bon region in northeastern tunisia which is one of the regions most specialized in this type of product for the sampling we used a stratified random selection of farms based on their size all selected farmers use drip irrigation system and about 70 of them have lower than 2 ha citrus production value per ha is used as the output of our function where we also considered four additional inputs water mechanization labor and other inputs which were used in the estimation of the production function model several studies have used data per hectare dealing with te and calculating return to scale rts as the sum of output elasticities for all inputs sharma et al 2001 alam et al 2012 salam et al 2012 yigezu 2013 mburu et al 2014 frija et al 2014 aheisibwe et al 2018 wassihun et al 2019 khatiwada and yadav 2022 kodua et al 2022 we followed the method used by these authors table 1 presents summary statistics of the variables used in the stochastic frontier production function model production value per ha is used as an output y in addition aggregate inputs per ha included as variables in the estimation of the frontier production function are 1 x1 the water applied 2 x2 the cost of mechanization 3 x3 the labour cost and 4 x4 the expenditure for other inputs consisting of chemical fertilizers pesticides etc the average value of citrus production is 15 913 34 tunisian national dinar tnd 1 per farm which ranges from a minimum of 6000 to 35 200 tnd ha the standard deviation of the production value is 6710 also summary statistics in table 1 indicates that there is a high variability of the irrigation volume among the sample of considered farms 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimates of irrigation water efficiencies both translog and cd production functions were estimated however we decided to select the cd production function based on the lr statistical tests the appropriate critical value is obtained from kodde and palm 1986 results of the lr test failed to reject the null hypothesis which implies that the cd is the best fit for the data the estimated coefficients in cd functional form directly represent the elasticity of production the rts indicates the percentage change in output when all inputs change by the same proportion the sum of the coefficients partial elasticities measures rts for the cobb douglass function if this estimate is greater than equal to or less than one we have increasing constant or decreasing rts respectively table 2 shows the maximum likelihood estimates mle of the parameters of the cobb douglass stochastic frontier production function which were obtained using the computer program frontier 4 1 created by coelli 1994 the sigma square σ2 value was statistically significant at the 5 level for the selected model affirming the correctness of the specified assumptions of the distribution of composite error term the gamma γ value for the model 0 73 was also statistically significant at the 5 level meaning that variation in output of citrus could be attributed to the existence of technical inefficiency our empirical study used cross sectional data for selected citrus producing farms under irrigation conditions in the same region cap bon which reduce the effect of climate variables this is confirmed by the high value of gamma indicating that 73 of the deviations from the frontier are due to technical inefficiency the remaining portion 27 of the deviations from the frontier is due to noise weather diseases etc the mean te in the study area was about 78 4 this indicates that on average citrus farmers could increase their output by as much as 21 6 through more efficient use of production inputs the estimated output elasticities with respect to each of the inputs are found to have values falling between 0 and 1 table 2 this shows that output is inelastic with respect to each of the inputs included in the model the estimated coefficients of water and labour variables were statistically significant at the 5 level and depicted the expected signs the output elasticity with respect to water is 0 29 this means that if we hold all other inputs constant ceteris paribus an increase of 1 in the amount of water applied would generate an increase of about 0 29 in output the sum of output elasticities with respect to the four inputs equals to 0 68 indicating a decreasing rts in citrus production in cap bon region table 3 shows the summary statistics results of te and wue scores in the sample of farms the mean te score is 78 4 and ranges between 43 8 and 98 1 this shows that there is an opportunity to improve efficiency among the considered farms empirical results reveal that significant water use inefficiencies do exist in the studied sample of farms this finding is in line with previous studies carried out in tunisia chemak 2012 chebil et al 2012 2013 chemak et al 2018 mean irrigation wue is found to be 44 3 and it also exhibits great variability ranging from 5 9 to 93 1 the estimated mean irrigation wue implies that the observed level of output could have been maintained by using the observed values of other inputs while using 56 7 less irrigation water this means that farmers can achieve significant savings in water use if their respective know how for irrigation would improve to the level of the best performing farmers in the region 4 2 marginal water value and optimal water price using eq 8 we estimated the mwv at different volumes of water applied the curve of mwv in fig 3 corresponds to the theoretical expectations where the mwv is negatively correlated to the volume of water applied the effect of wue improvements on mwv is illustrated in fig 3 where water values for citrus production in cap bon region are shown for different scenarios of inefficiency reductions 30 and 50 these results indicate that an improvement of wue could shift the mwv curve upwards and consequently result in higher water values efficient farmers are more effectively valorizing irrigation water according to benalaya et al 2015 the aggregation of irrigation water requirements of citrus during the growth stage in the cap bon region is estimated to 9000 m3 ha this value was validated by the local extension agents of the region the mwv is considerably higher than the current water price 0 13 tnd m3 at the amount of irrigation water requirements fig 3 also the mwv will not be lower than the current price of water in the region even for high water volumes the results show that there is a gap between the value of irrigation water and the price of water paid by farmers this confirms that irrigation water prices are subsidized and lead to overusing water resources hence it is possible to increase water price in order to reach the optimal water price without affecting significantly the farm s income this result is consistent with previous research studies in irrigated schemes of tunisia thabet 2003 chebil et al 2010 jeder et al 2019 maaroufi et al 2021 table 4 shows the effect of citrus price fluctuations on irrigation water values hence the results of simulation analysis reveal that irrigation water value estimates are heavily dependent on the citrus price increasing citrus price allows the mwv curve to be moved upwards indicating a subsequent increase in the water value smallholder farmers can get better price by enhancing their technical and organizational capacities for the marketing of agricultural products bernard et al 2008 fischer and qaim 2012 gramzow et al 2018 abdelhafidh et al 2018 al ruqishi et al 2020 kongai et al 2020 thus irrigation values would increase as a result of crop price increases and irrigation efficiency improvement 5 conclusion this paper mainly examines the effects of water use efficiency and output price improvement on water irrigation values it also seeks to compare these water values with the current irrigation water price and determine the optimal price based on a sample of 42 farms in the primary citrus producing region of the country a stochastic frontier production function was used to estimate water use efficiency and changes in marginal water value under different levels of water applied these values are then compared to the current water price empirical results show that significant water use inefficiencies exist in the sample of farms under investigation overall mean technical efficiency and water use efficiency are found to be respectively 78 4 and 44 3 results also show that irrigation water value estimates are heavily dependent on citrus price and water use efficiency as citrus price increases and irrigation efficiencies improve water values increase finally the results show that there is a gap between the value of irrigation water and the price of water paid by farmers marginal water value is not lower than the current price of water in the region at the amount of irrigation water requirements and even for high water doses this confirms that irrigation water prices are subsidized and lead to overusing water resources hence application of higher irrigation water fees in order to reach the optimal water price without significantly affecting the farm s income is definitely feasible for the studied agricultural production system given the scarcity of water in tunisia it is recommended that water valuation in the different agricultural production systems and most importantly the strategic production systems would be considered in the future as a suitable criterion for irrigation water pricing improvement of water use efficiency and citrus price are needed for increasing water use charges which would help adaptation to climate change and maintaining irrigation sustainability in the country this requires optimized irrigation water management practices at the field level and enhancement of farmers technical and organizational capacities for the marketing of their products finally it should be noted that the objective of this study is not to extrapolate results but rather to validate a methodology which can be used to estimate optimal water price more research with different data sets of production systems and regions is suggested declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

economically efficient ee if it is both technically and allocatively efficient fig 1 depicts technical and allocative inefficiencies using output y and a single input water in our case to illustrate the situation of efficiency and inefficiency farms we depict two curves f and f it is clear that f displays higher output for a given level of production input a farmer operating at f is more efficient technically that a farmer operating on f the production frontier for a farm using best practice techniques efficient situation is shown by frontier f at points b and c the farms are technically efficient since they operate on the frontier f a farm that operates at point c on the frontier f uses w level of water and receives profit max π c where the iso profit line is tangent to its production frontier is economically efficient on the other hand the farm at point b on the frontier f uses wi level of water and receives lower profits π b than farm c this profit loss is due to allocative inefficiencies chebil and frija 2016 however farm a is neither allocative nor te it operates at the curve f of inefficient farms the curves of marginal water value mwv for efficient water use mwvtec and inefficient water use mwvintec are illustrated in fig 1 the difference between the mwv in the two situations is equal to the loss of water value associated with technical inefficiency however the allocative inefficiency is given by the difference between the mwv and the water price chebil and frija 2016 3 methodology 3 1 technical and water use efficiencies in this study we use the sfa as proposed by aigner et al 1977 to estimate te and wue scores of farms the sfa incorporates in the deterministic function the error term that accounts for the statistical noise the composite error term includes a random error and inefficiency terms according to karagiannis et al 2003 the methodological framework of technology to estimate wue is described by the following sfa 1 yi f xi wi

inefficiency component and is assumed to be independently distributed such that ui follows a truncated at zero u i 0 normal distribution n 0 σ u 2 while the term vi a symmetrical two sided random error assumed to be independently and identically distributed n 0 σ v 2 is associated with random factors beyond the control of the farmer measurement errors weather diseases it is assumed that the two error components u and v are independent of each other then farm specific estimates of output oriented te are obtained as t e i 0 exp u i kumbhakar and lovell 2000 while farm specific estimates of input oriented te are derived by equation 1 with yi f ʋixi ʋiwi α exp vi and solving for tei i ʋi atkinson and cornwell 1994 reinhard et al 1999 thus tei 0 is greater equal or less than tei i whenever

et al 2012 yigezu 2013 mburu et al 2014 frija et al 2014 aheisibwe et al 2018 wassihun et al 2019 khatiwada and yadav 2022 kodua et al 2022 we followed the method used by these authors table 1 presents summary statistics of the variables used in the stochastic frontier production function model production value per ha is used as an output y in addition aggregate inputs per ha included as variables in the estimation of the frontier production function are 1 x1 the water applied 2 x2 the cost of mechanization 3 x3 the labour cost and 4 x4 the expenditure for other inputs consisting of chemical fertilizers pesticides etc the average value of citrus production is 15 913 34 tunisian national dinar tnd 1 per farm which ranges from a minimum of 6000 to 35 200 tnd ha the standard deviation of the production value is 6710 also summary statistics in table 1 indicates that there is a high variability of the irrigation volume among the sample of considered farms 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimates of irrigation water efficiencies both translog and cd production functions were estimated however we decided to select the cd production function based on the lr statistical tests the appropriate critical value is obtained from kodde and palm 1986 results of the lr test failed to reject the null hypothesis which implies that the cd is the best fit for the data the estimated coefficients in cd functional form directly represent the elasticity of production the rts indicates the percentage change in output when all inputs change by the same proportion the sum of the coefficients partial elasticities measures rts for the cobb douglass function if this estimate is greater than equal to or less than one we have increasing constant or decreasing rts respectively table 2 shows the maximum likelihood estimates mle of the parameters of the cobb douglass stochastic frontier production function which were obtained using the computer program frontier 4 1 created by coelli 1994 the sigma square σ2 value was statistically significant at the 5 level for the selected model affirming the correctness of the specified assumptions of the distribution of composite error term the gamma γ value for the model 0 73 was also statistically significant at the 5 level meaning that variation in output of citrus could be attributed to the existence of technical inefficiency our empirical study used cross sectional data for selected citrus producing farms under irrigation conditions in the same region cap bon which reduce the effect of climate variables this is confirmed by the high value of gamma indicating that 73 of the deviations from the frontier are due to technical inefficiency the remaining portion 27 of the deviations from the frontier is due to noise weather diseases etc the mean te in the study area was about 78 4 this indicates that on average citrus farmers could increase their output by as much as 21 6 through more efficient use of production inputs the estimated output elasticities with respect to each of the inputs are found to have values falling between 0 and 1 table 2 this shows that output is inelastic with respect to each of the inputs included in the model the estimated coefficients of water and labour variables were statistically significant at the 5 level and depicted the expected signs the output elasticity with respect to water is 0 29 this means that if we hold all other inputs constant ceteris paribus an increase of 1 in the amount of water applied would generate an increase of about 0 29 in output the sum of output elasticities with respect to the four inputs equals to 0 68 indicating a decreasing rts in citrus production in cap bon region table 3 shows the summary statistics results of te and wue scores in the sample of farms the mean te score is 78 4 and ranges between 43 8 and 98 1 this shows that there is an opportunity to improve efficiency among the considered farms empirical results reveal that significant water use inefficiencies do exist in the studied sample of farms this finding is in line with previous studies carried out in tunisia chemak 2012 chebil et al 2012 2013 chemak et al 2018 mean irrigation wue is found to be 44 3 and it also exhibits great variability ranging from 5 9 to 93 1 the estimated mean irrigation wue implies that the observed level of output could have been maintained by using the observed values of other inputs while using 56 7 less irrigation water this means that farmers can achieve significant savings in water use if their respective know how for irrigation would improve to the level of the best performing farmers in the region 4 2 marginal water value and optimal water price using eq 8 we estimated the mwv at different volumes of water applied the curve of mwv in fig 3 corresponds to the theoretical expectations where the mwv is negatively correlated to the volume of water applied the effect of wue improvements on mwv is illustrated in fig 3 where water values for citrus production in cap bon region are shown for different scenarios of inefficiency reductions 30 and 50 these results indicate that an improvement of wue could shift the mwv curve upwards and consequently result in higher water values efficient farmers are more effectively valorizing irrigation water according to benalaya et al 2015 the aggregation of irrigation water requirements of citrus during the growth stage in the cap bon region is estimated to 9000 m3 ha this value was validated by the local extension agents of the region the mwv is considerably higher than the current water price 0 13 tnd m3 at the amount of irrigation water requirements fig 3 also the mwv will not be lower than the current price of water in the region even for high water volumes the results show that there is a gap between the value of irrigation water and the price of water paid by farmers this confirms that irrigation water prices are subsidized and lead to overusing water resources hence it is possible to increase water price in order to reach the optimal water price without affecting significantly the farm s income this result is consistent with previous research studies in irrigated schemes of tunisia thabet 2003 chebil et al 2010 jeder et al 2019 maaroufi et al 2021 table 4 shows the effect of citrus price fluctuations on irrigation water values hence the results of simulation analysis reveal that irrigation water value estimates are heavily dependent on the citrus price increasing citrus price allows the mwv curve to be moved upwards indicating a subsequent increase in the water value smallholder farmers can get better price by enhancing their technical and organizational capacities for the marketing of agricultural products bernard et al 2008 fischer and qaim 2012 gramzow et al 2018 abdelhafidh et al 2018 al ruqishi et al 2020 kongai et al 2020 thus irrigation values would increase as a result of crop price increases and irrigation efficiency improvement 5 conclusion this paper mainly examines the effects of water use efficiency and output price improvement on water irrigation values it also seeks to compare these water values with the current irrigation water price and determine the optimal price based on a sample of 42 farms in the primary citrus producing region of the country a stochastic frontier production function was used to estimate water use efficiency and changes in marginal water value under different levels of water applied these values are then compared to the current water price empirical results show that significant water use inefficiencies exist in the sample of farms under investigation overall mean technical efficiency and water use efficiency are found to be respectively 78 4 and 44 3 results also show that irrigation water value estimates are heavily dependent on citrus price and water use efficiency as citrus price increases and irrigation efficiencies improve water values increase finally the results show that there is a gap between the value of irrigation water and the price of water paid by farmers marginal water value is not lower than the current price of water in the region at the amount of irrigation water requirements and even for high water doses this confirms that irrigation water prices are subsidized and lead to overusing water resources hence application of higher irrigation water fees in order to reach the optimal water price without significantly affecting the farm s income is definitely feasible for the studied agricultural production system given the scarcity of water in tunisia it is recommended that water valuation in the different agricultural production systems and most importantly the strategic production systems would be considered in the future as a suitable criterion for irrigation water pricing improvement of water use efficiency and citrus price are needed for increasing water use charges which would help adaptation to climate change and maintaining irrigation sustainability in the country this requires optimized irrigation water management practices at the field level and enhancement of farmers technical and organizational capacities for the marketing of their products finally it should be noted that the objective of this study is not to extrapolate results but rather to validate a methodology which can be used to estimate optimal water price more research with different data sets of production systems and regions is suggested declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9551,the effective precipitation p e and crop water requirements et c can reflect the agricultural water supply and demand situations under natural precipitation conditions and the encounter risk analysis of p e and et c is a prerequisite for regional water resources allocation and irrigation planning considering an entire growing season of rape maize in the hilly area of southwest china during 1961 2017 this study employed the popular copula functions to fit two dimensional joint distribution of annual et c and p e and analyzed the natural agriculture water shortages risk of different encounter situations the results indicated et c and p e presented a negative relativity and the gaussian copula was found to be more suitable to estimate the joint distribution of et c and p e the asynchronous encounter probability was higher two times than the synchronous encounter probability and the pairs rich p e poor et c poor p e rich et c had the greatest probability with value of 16 59 indicating the natural water supply and demand usually was unmatched the conditional probability of p e without exceeding a certain value for different et c states increased with increased p e and the conditional probability of et c with exceeding a certain value for different p e states decreased with increased et c the conditional probability of p e without exceeding p e 37 5 p e 62 5 p e average et c exceeding et c 37 5 et c 62 5 et c average for different et c p e states was 44 97 69 12 the corresponding return period was 1 45 2 22 years showing natural agriculture water shortages risk was high under general situations however the conditional probabilities of extremely high et c low p e with given low p e high et c were less than 3 so extreme water shortages rarely occurred in the sichuan hilly area this study successfully applied the copula method to regional agricultural water shortages risk analysis and could provide a theoretical basis for regional water resources management and planning graphical abstract ga1 keywords encounter risk crop water requirements effective precipitation copula method joint distribution hilly area of southwest china 1 introduction water is the irreplaceable resource that the life depends on for existence which is an environmental resource for maintaining ecological balance and a strategic resource for determining regional planning and development ren et al 2019 huang et al 2021 in recent years the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources has become increasingly prominent zhang et al 2021 some areas have been experiencing moderate to severe water shortages due to the shrinking water availability rapid economic development and population increase and increase in water demand chen and sun 2015 gao et al 2018 especially regions dominated by agriculture food security may be threatened if agricultural water supply is unable to satisfy crop demands aiming to providing useful irrigation plan information for administrative department of water resources to prevent drought early it is necessary to analyze different water supply and demand situations under natural precipitation conditions the characteristics of natural water demand and supply were revealed by analyzing the relationship of reference evapotranspiration et 0 and precipitation p tabrizi et al 2010 vangelis et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 2017a 2017b phaml et al 2016 et 0 represents the water demands of crops and p refers to the natural water supply and they exhibit marked randomness due to the influences of climatological variables atmospheric circulation and human activities fan et al 2016 cecinati et al 2017 however crop water requirements et c consider the crop characteristics on the basis of et 0 and effective precipitation p e which refers to p minus the surface runoff and deep leakage is the major water sources for soil water under natural precipitation conditions xie et al 2018 nie et al 2019 pereira et al 2021 thus p e and et c can more accurately reflect water supply and demand situations of crops under natural conditions and the natural agriculture water shortages are caused by the unbalance between them gong et al 2020 there are complex relationships between et c and p e and single variable frequency analysis cannot fully estimate the water shortages probability a better understanding of hydrological phenomena can be achieved by establishing joint distribution that considers all relevant variables chebana and ouarda 2011 the multivariate hydrological analysis method mainly includes multivariate probability distribution function non parametric and copula methods yan et al 2009 however most of multivariate probability distribution function methods require that variables follow a same marginal distribution the multivariate normal distribution function even requires variables to obey the normal distribution and the applications of other multivariate distribution functions are limited to two dimension the joint distribution based on the non parametric method can well fit the measured data whereas the prediction ability is relatively insufficient and the marginal distribution type of the joint distribution is unknown in order to cope with these questions the copula method is introduced to the multivariate hydrological analysis which can flexibly construct the joint distribution of hydrological variables whose marginal distributions are arbitrary de michele and sal vadori 2003 moreover the marginal distribution and correlation structure based on the copula method can be considered separately which is suitable for both positive and negative correlations due to the advantages the copula method has been applied to the encounter risk analysis in many fields such as flood chen et al 2012 zhang and singh 2014 akbari and reddy 2020 drought song and singh 2010 wong et al 2010 pham et al 2013 nguyen huy et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 storm characteristics vandenberge et al 2010 precipitation frequency herr and krzysztofowicz 2005 zhang and singh 2007 and stochastic reservoir optimization karamouz et al 2009 celeste and billib 2012 etc tsakiris et al 2015 researched the dependence of the peak flow flood volume based on the copulas approach from a case study example of the ashuapmushuan river basin in quebec canada dodangeh et al 2020 analyzed the coincidence risks of annual maximum floods on the jinsha river and min river of china and established the joint distribution of flood magnitude and occurrence dates of the two rivers ayantobo et al 2018 studied the return period of droughts severity duration and intensity in mainland china by using the bivariate archimedean copulas during 1961 2013 hui mean et al 2019 employed the trivial copula distribution to analyze the severity duration and intensity of drought in peninsular malaysia these studies have shown the copula method can well fit the dependences of variables and the calculated encounter probability and return period can provide theoretical basis for the risk analysis however few studies focused on the water shortage risk by the copula method zhang et al 2014 constructed a joint distribution based on et 0 and p to analyze the relationship of water demand and supply in the luhun irrigation district of henan province of china ding et al 2011 analyzed the water shortage risk by the copula method in the weining irrigation district of ningxia china nevertheless the data series based on et 0 and p could not reflect the actual water supply and demand of crops compared with crop water requirements et c and effective precipitation p e and the use of copula method was limited to the archimedean copula family in previous studies moreover studies on the water shortage risk were concentrated in arid or semi arid areas while the humid areas with seasonal water shortages tended to be neglected the hilly area of southwest china a typical moist hilly region is an important agricultural area the corn sown area is almost a quarter of whole china and the wheat sown area is almost one fifth of the whole china the food production in this area tends to be concerned due to the increase of water supply and demand imbalance guedes 2011 li et al 2014 especially southwest china suffered relatively severe water resource shortages in the 2000s lu et al 2011 niu and chen 2014 xu et al 2015 in general it is urgent to study natural agricultural water shortages by exploring the relationship of et c and p e in the hilly area of southwest china based on more types of copula functions therefore considering a typical rotation system in the sichuan hilly area this study aims to analyze regional agricultural water shortages risk based on different encounter situations of water supply p e and demand et c under natural precipitation conditions by the copula method the main contents are as follows firstly the data series of p e and et c over a hydrological year the growth period of rape maize were obtained based on the meteorological data in the sichuan hilly area of china from 1961 to 2017 and then their marginal distributions were determined moreover the copula method was employed to establish the optimal joint probability distribution of et c and p e by using a goodness of fit evaluation finally based on the optimal joint distribution the joint encounter risk of p e and et c in different states was presented and the conditional probability and the corresponding return period of low p e high et c for different et c p e states were also explored the study can provide a theoretical basis for the construction and management of farmland water conservancy projects and play a positive role in regional water resources management and drought resistance 2 study area and data sichuan hilly area e 104 03 107 12 n 30 30 32 03 situating in the center of the sichuan basin is a typical hilly region in southwest china including mianyang neijiang guangyuan leshan cities etc it covers an area of 10500 km2 with an altitude ranging from 300 to 600 m the study area belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate with the annual mean temperature of 17 5 and the annual mean precipitation of 1000 mm approximately wang et al 2017 the sichuan hilly area is a main food producing region with dense population distribution in southwest china and farmland typically accounts for 20 60 of the land cover crop rotation including maize rape sweet potato and wheat has been practiced since the 1980s wang et al 2012 golosov et al 2017 rape is the largest oil crop and the main winter crop and wheat is the main food crop in the hilly area of central sichuan so in the study the whole growth period of rape maize was used to analyze the encounter risk of crop water requirements et c and effective precipitation p e from september 15th of the first year rape sowing to august 16th of the next year maize harvest daily meteorological data from 1961 to 2017 were from the china meteorological data sharing service network http data cma cn including precipitation p sunshine duration n average temperature t maximum temperature t max minimum temperature t min relative humidity rh and wind speed at 2 m above the ground u 2 transformed from wind speed at 10 m height nine representative stations were selected considering the reliability of data and the topography of the study area and a small amount of missing data were supplemented by the linear interpolation method the data omission rate is 0 02 the geographical location and stations distribution of the sichuan hilly area is presented in fig 1 moreover thiessen polygon was applied to acquire an average surface data based on the point data of nine meteorological stations according to the daily meteorological data at nine representative stations regional climatic variables in the sichuan hilly area were calculated by the thiessen polygon analysis fig 2 and the annual mean t u 2 rh and n of the study area is 17 01 c 0 89 m s 1 77 51 and 3 30 h respectively 3 methodology a flow chart summarizing the employed methods in the study is displayed in fig 3 this included two parts 1 the joint probability distribution of p e and et c was constructed based on the daily meteorological data from 1961 to 2017 in the sichuan hilly area of china annual p e and et c values of the whole growth period of rape maize were obtained the marginal distributions of p e and et c were determined from five common univariate distributions by the hypothesis testing and root mean square error rmse the frank gumbel clayton gaussian and student t copulas were employed to fit the dependence relationship between et c and p e and the optimal copula function was selected by rmse and the akaike information criterion aic 2 the encounter risk of p e and et c under different states was analyzed according to the frequency of pk 62 5 and pf 37 5 the p e and et c were divided into three states poor p p e or et c 62 5 normal 37 5 p p e or et c 62 5 and rich p p e or et c 37 5 the synchronous and asynchronous encounter probabilities joint probability of et c and p e were considered and the conditional probability of p e without exceeding a certain value et c with exceeding a certain value for different et c p e states was analyzed specially the conditional probability of low p e high et c with a given high et c low p e was further explored 3 1 crop water requirements et c and effective precipitation p e crop water requirements et c is an essential basis for rational development and utilization of regional water resources which can be calculated by the single crop coefficient approach the formula is as follows 1 e t c k c e t 0 where et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm and k c is the crop coefficient in the study et 0 was estimated by the penman monteith formula recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 the k c values of rape and maize referred to the results table 1 effective precipitation p e is the net water quantity that supplies to the crop root soil during the whole growing period it can be determined by the precipitation and effective utilization coefficient the formula is as follows 2 p e α p where p is the precipitation mm and α is the effective utilization coefficient when p 5 mm α is 1 0 5 mm p 50 mm α is 0 8 1 0 p 50 mm α is 0 7 0 8 kang and cai 1996 in this study considering the whole growth period of rape maize from september 15th to august 16th of the next year regional data series of annual p e and et c were calculated to analyze the agricultural water shortages in the sichuan hilly area a goodness of fit based on the kolmogorov smirnov k s test and root mean square error rmse was applied to select the optimal marginal distribution functions of p e and et c respectively when the sample size n is 56 the critical value of k s test is 0 1786 for a significant level α 0 05 3 2 copula method 3 2 1 copula theory copula is a function that connects multivariate joint distribution and one dimensional marginal distribution which was firstly introduced by sklar 1959 the construction of joint probability distribution based on the copula is independent of marginal distribution and it is a mapping c 0 1 n 0 1 assume a n dimensional random vector x x 1 x n with the marginal distribution function f xi x 1 x n based on the sklar s theorem the joint distribution function h with random vector x can be expressed with the copula function c as follows avila et al 2020 3 h x 1 x n c f 1 x 1 f n x n c u 1 u n where u i f i x i and u i u 0 1 for i 1 n moreover the copula function c is unique when marginal distributions are continuous nelsen 2006 the bivariate copula is a mapping c 0 1 0 1 0 1 and it satisfies the following properties nelsen 1999 4 u v 0 1 c u 0 0 c 0 v 0 c u 1 u c 1 v v 5 u 1 u 2 v 1 v 2 0 1 u 1 u 2 v 1 v 2 c u 2 v 2 c u 2 v 1 c u 1 v 2 c u 1 v 1 0 6 u v 0 1 2 max u v 1 0 c u v min u v where u and v are the marginal distributions of random variable x 1 and x 2 3 2 2 selection of copula functions multiple copula functions can be used to establish two dimensional joint distribution of hydrological variables among which the archimedean copula family and the elliptical copula family are most widely applied the archimedean copula family which has simple structure and easy calculation can construct the joint distribution functions with diversified forms and strong adaptability particularly the frank gumbel hougaard and clayton copulas the elliptical copula family was firstly presented by fang et al 2002 which can well fit multivariate extreme value distributions and non normal structures the common elliptic copula functions include gaussian and student t copula and the primary characteristics of these functions are that they can be extended to any dimensions and applied to positive and negative correlations between variables huang and wang 2018 the common bivariate copula functions are shown in table 2 and these five copula functions were also used in this study the parameters of copula functions are determined by the two stage maximum likelihood method which respectively estimates the parameters of marginal distribution and copula function by establishing two likelihood functions genest et al 2007 3 2 3 goodness of fit evaluation according to the empirical joint probability and theoretical joint probability of two dimensional variables the root mean square error rmse and akaike information criterion aic are utilized to estimate the copula functions 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i p ei 2 8 aic n ln i 1 n p i p ei 2 n 2 k where n is the number of samples p i and p ei are the calculated and empirical frequency of the copula function respectively and k is the number of parameters of the copula function the copula with lower rmse and aic is selected as the optimal joint probability distribution 3 3 joint probability assume that h x y is the two dimensional joint distribution function of x p e and y et c and f x x and f y y are the corresponding marginal distributions respectively the bivariable joint distribution based on the copula function c can be expressed as 9 h x y c f x x f y y c u v x y where u and v refer to the marginal distribution probability respectively according to the frequency of pk 62 5 and pf 37 5 the p e and et c are classified as poor normal and rich three states chinese national standard gb t 50095 98 when p p e or et c 62 5 p e or et c is poor when 37 5 p p e or et c 62 5 p e or et c is normal and when p p e or et c 37 5 p e or et c is rich based on these nine encounter situations for the natural water supply and demand are obtained i e p e rich et c rich p e rich et c normal p e rich et c poor p e normal et c rich p e normal et c normal p e normal et c poor p e poor et c rich p e poor et c normal and p e poor et c poor 3 4 conditional probability and conditional return period the crops tend to be an unfavorable state when p e is less or et c is great therefore the situations of p e without exceeding a certain value et c with exceeding a certain value for different et c p e states are considered let x denote p e and y present et c when et c is in the state of rich normal or poor the conditional probability that p e is lower than a specific value is as follows 10 f x i y f x i y p x i x y y pf f x x f x y pf 1 f y y pf f x i y p x i y p x i x y pk y y pf f x y pf f x y pk f y y pf f y y pk f x i y k x i y p x i x y y pk f x y pk f y y pk where y pf is the et c value with frequency of 37 5 and y pk is the et c value with frequency of 62 5 the corresponding conditional return periods are t xi y f x i y t xi y p x i y and t xi y k x i y respectively when p e is in the state of rich normal or poor the conditional probability that et c is higher than a specific value is as follows 11 f y i x f x y i p y i y x x pf 1 f y y f x x pf f x pf y 1 f x x pf f y i x p x y i p y i y x pk x x pf f x x pf f x x pk f x pk y f x pf y f x x pf f x x pk f y i x k x y i p y i y x x pk f x x pk f x pk y f x x pk where x pf is the p e value with frequency of 37 5 and x pk is the p e value with frequency of 62 5 the corresponding conditional return periods are t yi x f x y i t yi x p x y i and t yi x k x y i respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 marginal distribution of p e and et c p e showed a slightly decreasing trend from 1961 to 2017 r 0 154 p 0 05 while et c barely changed r 0 0081 p 0 05 fig 4 a the scatter plot of p e and et c is shown in fig 4 b and p e and et c exhibited an inverse relationship with the kendall s rank coefficient τ of 0 11 the basic statistics of p e and et c from 1961 to 2017 were also given table 3 the annual average values of p e and et c were 723 mm and 753 mm respectively so there was a relatively less difference between them however p e 544 915 mm varied obviously than et c 671 749 mm during 1961 2017 with variation coefficient of 0 11 and 0 05 respectively the results indicated that the natural water supply was unstable and agricultural water resource shortages might exist during the growth period of rape maize in the sichuan hilly area of china five common distribution functions were used to fit p e and et c series respectively including normal lognormal gamma generalized extreme value and weibull distributions table 4 the results of k s test d of all distribution functions were less than the critical value 0 1786 and they all passed the k s test p e obeyed the lognormal distribution with the lowest rmse and aic of 0 020 and 432 05 respectively and et c followed the generalized extreme value distribution with the lowest rmse and aic of 0 042 and 349 02 respectively fig 5 gives the empirical and theoretical distributions of p e and et c there was a high consistency between the empirical and theoretical distributions suggesting that lognormal and generalized extreme value functions can appropriately represent the p e and et c series distributions respectively 4 2 the joint probability distribution of p e and et c due to the negative correlation between p e and et c series with the kendall s rank coefficient τ of 0 11 fig 4 only three copula functions gaussian student t and frank were suitable to fit the joint probability distribution between them the estimated parameters and goodness of fit test of copula functions are given in table 5 the gaussian copula had the lowest aic and rmse with values of 362 4 and 0 0386 respectively therefore the gaussian copula was employed to construct the joint probability distribution of p e and et c series the joint density function and joint distribution function based on gaussian copula of p e and et c are shown in fig 6 previous research about risk analysis tended to consider three common archimedean copula functions gumbel hougaard frank and clayton copulas among which the gumbel and clayton functions had limited application because they could not describe the negative correlation between random variables ding et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 2017a 2017b zhao et al 2021 the gaussian and student t copula functions that derived from elliptical copula family can well fit multivariate extreme value distribution and non normal structure which were not restricted by the dependency range or dependency structure type between variables fang et al 2002 therefore the fitting results of three copula functions frank gaussian and student t copulas were compared for showing the optimal joint probability distribution of p e and et c series in this study finally the gaussian copula was selected as the optimal joint distribution which presented a better performance than the frank copula often selected as the optimal equation in previous research there are many kinds of copula models that have been gradually introduced into hydrological applications such as the palackette mixed and empirical copulas salvadori and de michele 2004 in future research more copula functions should be considered to reflect the dependence of water shortages variables 4 3 the joint probability analysis of p e and et c according to different states of pe and etc poor normal and rich nine encounter situations were obtained to analyze the natural water supply and demand situations as noted in table 6 the encounter probabilities of p e and et c were calculated and it could be divided into two situations the synchronous and asynchronous encounter probabilities among synchronous encounter probabilities the probability of the rich p e rich et c was equal to that of the poor p e poor et c with the value of 11 58 and the normal p e normal et c had the minimum probability value 6 34 among asynchronous encounter probabilities the probabilities of the pairs rich p e normal et c normal p e rich et c normal p e poor et c and poor p e normal et c were equivalent with the value of 9 33 whereas the probabilities of the extreme combinations rich p e poor et c and poor p e rich et c were maximum value compared with other pairs with the value of 16 59 the asynchronous encounter probability was higher two times than the synchronous encounter probability which indicated that the water supply and demand usually were in an uncoordinated state under natural precipitation conditions in arid or semi arid regions natural water shortages usually occurred due to low precipitation zhang et al 2017a 2017b indicated that the probability of asynchronous encounter situations was as 3 26 times as that of synchronous encounter situations in the luhun irrigation district of china zhao et al 2021 pointed out the probability of asynchronous encounter situations reached 76 85 in the guanzhong plain of china compared with these regions the precipitation is relatively abundant in the sichuan hilly area although the asynchronous encounter probability in the sichuan hilly area was lower than luhun irrigation district and guanzhong plain the imbalance of water supply and demand still occurred frequently under natural precipitation conditions the phenomenon might be caused by the precipitation with significantly interannual variation and the growing season of rape maize could not include the time period from the middle of august to the middle of september which has abundant precipitation besides engineering water shortage is one of the main reasons for water scarcity in the hilly area of southwest china if the precipitation in wet season can be effectively stored and utilized the water resource shortages will be alleviated hence making full use of water resources and taking engineering measures to adjust annual water use is necessary to solve local imbalance between supply and demand of agricultural water resources 4 4 conditional probability and return period analysis of p e and et c 4 4 1 conditional probability and return period of low p e high et c for various et c p e states there was a relatively high asynchronous encounter probability between et c and p e with value of 70 50 table 5 when p e is lower than a certain value or et c is higher than a certain value the crop growth might be restricted under natural precipitation conditions therefore the conditional probability and return period of p e without exceeding a certain value et c with exceeding a certain value for different et c p e states were analyzed detailed in section 2 3 4 fig 7 shows the conditional probability and return period of p e without exceeding a certain value for different et c states rich y y 37 5 normal y 62 5 y y 37 5 poor y y 62 5 the conditional probability gradually increased with rising p e while the return period decreased as shown in fig 7 a the conditional probability was the greatest when et c was in the rich state followed by the normal and poor states the raking of return period was opposite with that of the conditional probability fig 7 b further the conditional probability and return period of three typical values of p e were analyzed table 7 the results showed that the conditional probability for the general encounter situations of p e without exceeding a certain value under different et c states was relatively great so the natural agriculture water shortages might usually occur the conditional probability and return period of et c with exceeding a certain value for different p e states rich x x 37 5 normal x 62 5 x x 37 5 poor x x 62 5 are shown in fig 8 according to fig 8 a the conditional probability decreased with the increase of et c the poor p e state had the greatest conditional probability followed by the normal p e and rich p e states as noted in fig 8 b the return period for different p e states increased with the increase of et c the return period for the rich p e state was the greatest and the lowest return period was found in the poor p e state the conditional probability and return period of three typical values of et c were further explored and showed in table 8 the conditional probabilities of et c exceeding three typical values when p e was in different states were 30 88 69 12 which were relatively great indicating that the natural water supply p e generally could not satisfy the growth of rape maize for the same states of p e and et c the conditional probability was greater than the joint probability for example the conditional probability of poor p e for et c in the rich state was 44 24 and the joint probability of pair poor p e rich et c was 16 59 this was consistent with the results of zhang et al 2017a 2017b according to the marginal distribution of p e and et c fig 5 when the frequency of p e was higher than 50 p e 50 720 mm and et c was lower than 80 et c 80 720 mm p e was less than et c and the natural agriculture water shortages began to occur the joint probability of pair p e 720 mm et c 720 mm was 41 94 whereas the conditional probability of pairs p e 720 mm et c 720 mm et c 720 mm p e 720 mm reached 52 43 and 83 88 respectively conditional probability is the ratio of the joint probability to the edge probability which is less than 1 so the value of conditional probability is lower than joint probability the probability values of joint and conditional distribution differed greatly indicating that different encounter situations should be considered in irrigation planning in order to make full use of natural water resources and reduce agricultural water shortages risk 4 4 2 conditional probability and return period of low p e high et c with a given high et c low p e when p e is lower and et c is higher the water shortages are more likely to occur therefore the conditional probability and return period of low p e high et c under a given high et c low p e condition should be considered to analyze the extreme water shortages situations table 9 describes the low p e high et c values and the corresponding frequencies the low p e values corresponding to the frequency of 62 5 75 90 95 99 were 695 668 626 601 and 559 mm respectively the high et c values corresponding to the frequency of 1 5 10 25 37 5 were 850 821 794 779 and 764 mm respectively when et c was higher than a specific high value the conditional probability and return period of low p e without exceeding a certain value were expressed as p x x y y and t x x y y respectively similarly the conditional probability and return period of high et c with given low p e were given as p y y x x and t y y x x the conditional probability and return period of low p e with a given high et c are presented in fig 9 the conditional probability of low p e for five given et c situations the frequency of 1 5 10 25 and 37 5 increased following the increased p e but the corresponding return period decreased however for a certain frequency of p e the conditional probability decreased when the frequency of et c increased and the return period showed an inverse variation the conditional probabilities of p e 695 mm and p e 668 mm with different given high et c were 30 69 55 79 the greatest return period was 3 26 years and the lowest one was 1 79 years indicating that the situations of relatively low p e under high et c conditions might be common occurrence which would result in a natural water shortage in the sichuan hilly area when p e 626 mm and p e 601 mm with a given high et c the conditional probability was relatively lower and the return period was greater with values of 6 88 20 31 and 4 92 14 64 years respectively the p e with 99 frequency was 559 mm and it represented an extreme situation of natural water supply the condition joint probabilities of p e 559 mm for five given low et c frequency was less than 3 and the corresponding return period was higher than 34 years the results showed that an extreme encounter situation of low p e with a given high et c rarely occurred and there were barely extreme agriculture water shortages in the sichuan hilly area of china according to the low p e and high et c values in table 9 the conditional probability and return period of high et c for five given low p e were obtained fig 10 with the increased et c the conditional probability of high et c decreased whereas the return period gradually increased moreover the conditional probability for a specific et c increased with a rising p e frequency and the corresponding return period decreased when et c 764 mm and et c 779 mm the conditional probabilities for five given p e frequency were 44 24 55 79 and 30 69 41 19 respectively the corresponding return periods were 1 79 2 26 years and 2 4 3 26 years respectively the results showed that the situations of relatively high et c under low p e conditions might be common occurrence which would result in a natural agriculture water shortage in the sichuan hilly area the conditional probability of high et c with the frequency of 15 for different given low p e was 19 21 28 03 and the return period was 3 57 5 21 years when et c 821 mm the conditional probabilities with given 62 5 75 90 95 and 99 of p e were 6 88 7 48 8 73 9 61 and 11 53 respectively the greatest return period was 14 54 years and the lowest one was 8 67 years specially the value of et c with 1 frequency was 850 mm and the crops had higher demand for water under this frequency the conditional probability for different given p e frequency was 1 49 2 94 and the corresponding return period was 34 01 67 21 years when et c was an extremely high value the conditional probability with a given low p e was lower suggesting that an extreme mismatch between water supply and demand was almost impossible under natural precipitation conditions therefore the extremely low p e and high et c rarely occurred in the sichuan hilly area and a serious agriculture water shortage also was rare under natural precipitation conditions however with global climate change precipitation has decreased and reference evapotranspiration has increased in the southwest china liu and zhang 2013 sun et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 this research found natural water supply p e showed negative changes and water demand et c rarely changed in this context natural water shortages may become more frequent and serious in the sichuan hilly area southwest china experienced several serious drought in the 2000s qiu 2010 if water shortages continue to develop the hydrological droughts are likely to occur huang et al 2017 afshar et al 2020 hou et al 2021 therefore the risk analysis of different encounter situations of p e and et c was essential for regional water resources planning and management which has a positive effect on drought early warning to avoid serious economic losses 4 5 suggestion and expectation based on the encounter risk analysis of p e and et c for the growth period of rape maize the water supply and demand usually were in an uncoordinated state under natural precipitation conditions although agricultural water shortages risk was high under natural precipitation conditions a serious water shortage would rarely occur in the sichuan hilly area these results may be used to predict reasonable irrigation water consumption and formulate irrigation system which is significant for regional water resources management the hilly area of southwest china has relatively abundant precipitation and engineering water shortage is one of the main reasons for agricultural water shortages the administrative department of water resources should plan and construct more water conservancy facilities to optimize the allocation of regional water resources in the future we will focus on the natural water supply and demand situations in different growth periods of crops and the three dimension joint probability precipitation crop water requirement irrigation water will also be concerned to explore the regional water resource shortages 5 conclusions this study carried out a regional encounter risk analysis of natural agriculture water supply and demand in the typical hilly area of southwest china the data series of annual p e and et c of whole growth period of the rape maize were calculated based on the meteorological data in the sichuan hilly area from 1961 to 2017 the copula method was employed to build the joint probability distribution of p e and et c and then the encounter risk of different p e and et c states was analyzed the conclusions are given as follows the most reasonable marginal distributions of annual p e and et c were the lognormal and generalized extreme value distributions respectively the gaussian copula was the optimal joint distribution with aic of 362 4 and rmse of 0 0386 nine joint encounter situations were obtained based on the frequency of pk 62 5 and pf 37 5 among which the pairs of rich p e poor et c and poor p e rich et c had the highest probability with value of 16 59 the asynchronous encounter probability was higher two times than the synchronous encounter probability indicating that the natural water supply p e tended to be inconsistent with water demand et c the conditional probability of p e without exceeding a certain value for different et c states increased with increased p e however the conditional probability of et c with exceeding a certain value for different p e states presented an inverse regularity the conditional probability of p e without exceeding p e 37 5 p e 62 5 and p e average et c exceeding et c 37 5 et c 62 5 and et c average for different et c p e states was 44 97 69 12 and the corresponding return period was 1 45 2 22 year thus agricultural water shortages risk was high under natural precipitation conditions however the extreme combinations of lower p e and higher et c had lower conditional probability and longer return period showing a serious water shortage would rarely occur in the sichuan hilly area these will provide reference and guide to the regional water resource management and drought resistance credit

9551,the effective precipitation p e and crop water requirements et c can reflect the agricultural water supply and demand situations under natural precipitation conditions and the encounter risk analysis of p e and et c is a prerequisite for regional water resources allocation and irrigation planning considering an entire growing season of rape maize in the hilly area of southwest china during 1961 2017 this study employed the popular copula functions to fit two dimensional joint distribution of annual et c and p e and analyzed the natural agriculture water shortages risk of different encounter situations the results indicated et c and p e presented a negative relativity and the gaussian copula was found to be more suitable to estimate the joint distribution of et c and p e the asynchronous encounter probability was higher two times than the synchronous encounter probability and the pairs rich p e poor et c poor p e rich et c had the greatest probability with value of 16 59 indicating the natural water supply and demand usually was unmatched the conditional probability of p e without exceeding a certain value for different et c states increased with increased p e and the conditional probability of et c with exceeding a certain value for different p e states decreased with increased et c the conditional probability of p e without exceeding p e 37 5 p e 62 5 p e average et c exceeding et c 37 5 et c 62 5 et c average for different et c p e states was 44 97 69 12 the corresponding return period was 1 45 2 22 years showing natural agriculture water shortages risk was high under general situations however the conditional probabilities of extremely high et c low p e with given low p e high et c were less than 3 so extreme water shortages rarely occurred in the sichuan hilly area this study successfully applied the copula method to regional agricultural water shortages risk analysis and could provide a theoretical basis for regional water resources management and planning graphical abstract ga1 keywords encounter risk crop water requirements effective precipitation copula method joint distribution hilly area of southwest china 1 introduction water is the irreplaceable resource that the life depends on for existence which is an environmental resource for maintaining ecological balance and a strategic resource for determining regional planning and development ren et al 2019 huang et al 2021 in recent years the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources has become increasingly prominent zhang et al 2021 some areas have been experiencing moderate to severe water shortages due to the shrinking water availability rapid economic development and population increase and increase in water demand chen and sun 2015 gao et al 2018 especially regions dominated by agriculture food security may be threatened if agricultural water supply is unable to satisfy crop demands aiming to providing useful irrigation plan information for administrative department of water resources to prevent drought early it is necessary to analyze different water supply and demand situations under natural precipitation conditions the characteristics of natural water demand and supply were revealed by analyzing the relationship of reference evapotranspiration et 0 and precipitation p tabrizi et al 2010 vangelis et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 2017a 2017b phaml et al 2016 et 0 represents the water demands of crops and p refers to the natural water supply and they exhibit marked randomness due to the influences of climatological variables atmospheric circulation and human activities fan et al 2016 cecinati et al 2017 however crop water requirements et c consider the crop characteristics on the basis of et 0 and effective precipitation p e which refers to p minus the surface runoff and deep leakage is the major water sources for soil water under natural precipitation conditions xie et al 2018 nie et al 2019 pereira et al 2021 thus p e and et c can more accurately reflect water supply and demand situations of crops under natural conditions and the natural agriculture water shortages are caused by the unbalance between them gong et al 2020 there are complex relationships between et c and p e and single variable frequency analysis cannot fully estimate the water shortages probability a better understanding of hydrological phenomena can be achieved by establishing joint distribution that considers all relevant variables chebana and ouarda 2011 the multivariate hydrological analysis method mainly includes multivariate probability distribution function non parametric and copula methods yan et al 2009 however most of multivariate probability distribution function methods require that variables follow a same marginal distribution the multivariate normal distribution function even requires variables to obey the normal distribution and the applications of other multivariate distribution functions are limited to two dimension the joint distribution based on the non parametric method can well fit the measured data whereas the prediction ability is relatively insufficient and the marginal distribution type of the joint distribution is unknown in order to cope with these questions the copula method is introduced to the multivariate hydrological analysis which can flexibly construct the joint distribution of hydrological variables whose marginal distributions are arbitrary de michele and sal vadori 2003 moreover the marginal distribution and correlation structure based on the copula method can be considered separately which is suitable for both positive and negative correlations due to the advantages the copula method has been applied to the encounter risk analysis in many fields such as flood chen et al 2012 zhang and singh 2014 akbari and reddy 2020 drought song and singh 2010 wong et al 2010 pham et al 2013 nguyen huy et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 storm characteristics vandenberge et al 2010 precipitation frequency herr and krzysztofowicz 2005 zhang and singh 2007 and stochastic reservoir optimization karamouz et al 2009 celeste and billib 2012 etc tsakiris et al 2015 researched the dependence of the peak flow flood volume based on the copulas approach from a case study example of the ashuapmushuan river basin in quebec canada dodangeh et al 2020 analyzed the coincidence risks of annual maximum floods on the jinsha river and min river of china and established the joint distribution of flood magnitude and occurrence dates of the two rivers ayantobo et al 2018 studied the return period of droughts severity duration and intensity in mainland china by using the bivariate archimedean copulas during 1961 2013 hui mean et al 2019 employed the trivial copula distribution to analyze the severity duration and intensity of drought in peninsular malaysia these studies have shown the copula method can well fit the dependences of variables and the calculated encounter probability and return period can provide theoretical basis for the risk analysis however few studies focused on the water shortage risk by the copula method zhang et al 2014 constructed a joint distribution based on et 0 and p to analyze the relationship of water demand and supply in the luhun irrigation district of henan province of china ding et al 2011 analyzed the water shortage risk by the copula method in the weining irrigation district of ningxia china nevertheless the data series based on et 0 and p could not reflect the actual water supply and demand of crops compared with crop water requirements et c and effective precipitation p e and the use of copula method was limited to the archimedean copula family in previous studies moreover studies on the water shortage risk were concentrated in arid or semi arid areas while the humid areas with seasonal water shortages tended to be neglected the hilly area of southwest china a typical moist hilly region is an important agricultural area the corn sown area is almost a quarter of whole china and the wheat sown area is almost one fifth of the whole china the food production in this area tends to be concerned due to the increase of water supply and demand imbalance guedes 2011 li et al 2014 especially southwest china suffered relatively severe water resource shortages in the 2000s lu et al 2011 niu and chen 2014 xu et al 2015 in general it is urgent to study natural agricultural water shortages by exploring the relationship of et c and p e in the hilly area of southwest china based on more types of copula functions therefore considering a typical rotation system in the sichuan hilly area this study aims to analyze regional agricultural water shortages risk based on different encounter situations of water supply p e and demand et c under natural precipitation conditions by the copula method the main contents are as follows firstly the data series of p e and et c over a hydrological year the growth period of rape maize were obtained based on the meteorological data in the sichuan hilly area of china from 1961 to 2017 and then their marginal distributions were determined moreover the copula method was employed to establish the optimal joint probability distribution of et c and p e by using a goodness of fit evaluation finally based on the optimal joint distribution the joint encounter risk of p e and et c in different states was presented and the conditional probability and the corresponding return period of low p e high et c for different et c p e states were also explored the study can provide a theoretical basis for the construction and management of farmland water conservancy projects and play a positive role in regional water resources management and drought resistance 2 study area and data sichuan hilly area e 104 03 107 12 n 30 30 32 03 situating in the center of the sichuan basin is a typical hilly region in southwest china including mianyang neijiang guangyuan leshan cities etc it covers an area of 10500 km2 with an altitude ranging from 300 to 600 m the study area belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate with the annual mean temperature of 17 5 and the annual mean precipitation of 1000 mm approximately wang et al 2017 the sichuan hilly area is a main food producing region with dense population distribution in southwest china and farmland typically accounts for 20 60 of the land cover crop rotation including maize rape sweet potato and wheat has been practiced since the 1980s wang et al 2012 golosov et al 2017 rape is the largest oil crop and the main winter crop and wheat is the main food crop in the hilly area of central sichuan so in the study the whole growth period of rape maize was used to analyze the encounter risk of crop water requirements et c and effective precipitation p e from september 15th of the first year rape sowing to august 16th of the next year maize harvest daily meteorological data from 1961 to 2017 were from the china meteorological data sharing service network http data cma cn including precipitation p sunshine duration n average temperature t maximum temperature t max minimum temperature t min relative humidity rh and wind speed at 2 m above the ground u 2 transformed from wind speed at 10 m height nine representative stations were selected considering the reliability of data and the topography of the study area and a small amount of missing data were supplemented by the linear interpolation method the data omission rate is 0 02 the geographical location and stations distribution of the sichuan hilly area is presented in fig 1 moreover thiessen polygon was applied to acquire an average surface data based on the point data of nine meteorological stations according to the daily meteorological data at nine representative stations regional climatic variables in the sichuan hilly area were calculated by the thiessen polygon analysis fig 2 and the annual mean t u 2 rh and n of the study area is 17 01 c 0 89 m s 1 77 51 and 3 30 h respectively 3 methodology a flow chart summarizing the employed methods in the study is displayed in fig 3 this included two parts 1 the joint probability distribution of p e and et c was constructed based on the daily meteorological data from 1961 to 2017 in the sichuan hilly area of china annual p e and et c values of the whole growth period of rape maize were obtained the marginal distributions of p e and et c were determined from five common univariate distributions by the hypothesis testing and root mean square error rmse the frank gumbel clayton gaussian and student t copulas were employed to fit the dependence relationship between et c and p e and the optimal copula function was selected by rmse and the akaike information criterion aic 2 the encounter risk of p e and et c under different states was analyzed according to the frequency of pk 62 5 and pf 37 5 the p e and et c were divided into three states poor p p e or et c 62 5 normal 37 5 p p e or et c 62 5 and rich p p e or et c 37 5 the synchronous and asynchronous encounter probabilities joint probability of et c and p e were considered and the conditional probability of p e without exceeding a certain value et c with exceeding a certain value for different et c p e states was analyzed specially the conditional probability of low p e high et c with a given high et c low p e was further explored 3 1 crop water requirements et c and effective precipitation p e crop water requirements et c is an essential basis for rational development and utilization of regional water resources which can be calculated by the single crop coefficient approach the formula is as follows 1 e t c k c e t 0 where et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm and k c is the crop coefficient in the study et 0 was estimated by the penman monteith formula recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 the k c values of rape and maize referred to the results table 1 effective precipitation p e is the net water quantity that supplies to the crop root soil during the whole growing period it can be determined by the precipitation and effective utilization coefficient the formula is as follows 2 p e α p where p is the precipitation mm and α is the effective utilization coefficient when p 5 mm α is 1 0 5 mm p 50 mm α is 0 8 1 0 p 50 mm α is 0 7 0 8 kang and cai 1996 in this study considering the whole growth period of rape maize from september 15th to august 16th of the next year regional data series of annual p e and et c were calculated to analyze the agricultural water shortages in the sichuan hilly area a goodness of fit based on the kolmogorov smirnov k s test and root mean square error rmse was applied to select the optimal marginal distribution functions of p e and et c respectively when the sample size n is 56 the critical value of k s test is 0 1786 for a significant level α 0 05 3 2 copula method 3 2 1 copula theory copula is a function that connects multivariate joint distribution and one dimensional marginal distribution which was firstly introduced by sklar 1959 the construction of joint probability distribution based on the copula is independent of marginal distribution and it is a mapping c 0 1 n 0 1 assume a n dimensional random vector x x 1 x n with the marginal distribution function f xi x 1 x n based on the sklar s theorem the joint distribution function h with random vector x can be expressed with the copula function c as follows avila et al 2020 3 h x 1 x n c f 1 x 1 f n x n c u 1 u n where u i f i x i and u i u 0 1 for i 1 n moreover the copula function c is unique when marginal distributions are continuous nelsen 2006 the bivariate copula is a mapping c 0 1 0 1 0 1 and it satisfies the following properties nelsen 1999 4 u v 0 1 c u 0 0 c 0 v 0 c u 1 u c 1 v v 5 u 1 u 2 v 1 v 2 0 1 u 1 u 2 v 1 v 2 c u 2 v 2 c u 2 v 1 c u 1 v 2 c u 1 v 1 0 6 u v 0 1 2 max u v 1 0 c u v min u v where u and v are the marginal distributions of random variable x 1 and x 2 3 2 2 selection of copula functions multiple copula functions can be used to establish two dimensional joint distribution of hydrological variables among which the archimedean copula family and the elliptical copula family are most widely applied the archimedean copula family which has simple structure and easy calculation can construct the joint distribution functions with diversified forms and strong adaptability particularly the frank gumbel hougaard and clayton copulas the elliptical copula family was firstly presented by fang et al 2002 which can well fit multivariate extreme value distributions and non normal structures the common elliptic copula functions include gaussian and student t copula and the primary characteristics of these functions are that they can be extended to any dimensions and applied to positive and negative correlations between variables huang and wang 2018 the common bivariate copula functions are shown in table 2 and these five copula functions were also used in this study the parameters of copula functions are determined by the two stage maximum likelihood method which respectively estimates the parameters of marginal distribution and copula function by establishing two likelihood functions genest et al 2007 3 2 3 goodness of fit evaluation according to the empirical joint probability and theoretical joint probability of two dimensional variables the root mean square error rmse and akaike information criterion aic are utilized to estimate the copula functions 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i p ei 2 8 aic n ln i 1 n p i p ei 2 n 2 k where n is the number of samples p i and p ei are the calculated and empirical frequency of the copula function respectively and k is the number of parameters of the copula function the copula with lower rmse and aic is selected as the optimal joint probability distribution 3 3 joint probability assume that h x y is the two dimensional joint distribution function of x p e and y et c and f x x and f y y are the corresponding marginal distributions respectively the bivariable joint distribution based on the copula function c can be expressed as 9 h x y c f x x f y y c u v x y where u and v refer to the marginal distribution probability respectively according to the frequency of pk 62 5 and pf 37 5 the p e and et c are classified as poor normal and rich three states chinese national standard gb t 50095 98 when p p e or et c 62 5 p e or et c is poor when 37 5 p p e or et c 62 5 p e or et c is normal and when p p e or et c 37 5 p e or et c is rich based on these nine encounter situations for the natural water supply and demand are obtained i e p e rich et c rich p e rich et c normal p e rich et c poor p e normal et c rich p e normal et c normal p e normal et c poor p e poor et c rich p e poor et c normal and p e poor et c poor 3 4 conditional probability and conditional return period the crops tend to be an unfavorable state when p e is less or et c is great therefore the situations of p e without exceeding a certain value et c with exceeding a certain value for different et c p e states are considered let x denote p e and y present et c when et c is in the state of rich normal or poor the conditional probability that p e is lower than a specific value is as follows 10 f x i y f x i y p x i x y y pf f x x f x y pf 1 f y y pf f x i y p x i y p x i x y pk y y pf f x y pf f x y pk f y y pf f y y pk f x i y k x i y p x i x y y pk f x y pk f y y pk where y pf is the et c value with frequency of 37 5 and y pk is the et c value with frequency of 62 5 the corresponding conditional return periods are t xi y f x i y t xi y p x i y and t xi y k x i y respectively when p e is in the state of rich normal or poor the conditional probability that et c is higher than a specific value is as follows 11 f y i x f x y i p y i y x x pf 1 f y y f x x pf f x pf y 1 f x x pf f y i x p x y i p y i y x pk x x pf f x x pf f x x pk f x pk y f x pf y f x x pf f x x pk f y i x k x y i p y i y x x pk f x x pk f x pk y f x x pk where x pf is the p e value with frequency of 37 5 and x pk is the p e value with frequency of 62 5 the corresponding conditional return periods are t yi x f x y i t yi x p x y i and t yi x k x y i respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 marginal distribution of p e and et c p e showed a slightly decreasing trend from 1961 to 2017 r 0 154 p 0 05 while et c barely changed r 0 0081 p 0 05 fig 4 a the scatter plot of p e and et c is shown in fig 4 b and p e and et c exhibited an inverse relationship with the kendall s rank coefficient τ of 0 11 the basic statistics of p e and et c from 1961 to 2017 were also given table 3 the annual average values of p e and et c were 723 mm and 753 mm respectively so there was a relatively less difference between them however p e 544 915 mm varied obviously than et c 671 749 mm during 1961 2017 with variation coefficient of 0 11 and 0 05 respectively the results indicated that the natural water supply was unstable and agricultural water resource shortages might exist during the growth period of rape maize in the sichuan hilly area of china five common distribution functions were used to fit p e and et c series respectively including normal lognormal gamma generalized extreme value and weibull distributions table 4 the results of k s test d of all distribution functions were less than the critical value 0 1786 and they all passed the k s test p e obeyed the lognormal distribution with the lowest rmse and aic of 0 020 and 432 05 respectively and et c followed the generalized extreme value distribution with the lowest rmse and aic of 0 042 and 349 02 respectively fig 5 gives the empirical and theoretical distributions of p e and et c there was a high consistency between the empirical and theoretical distributions suggesting that lognormal and generalized extreme value functions can appropriately represent the p e and et c series distributions respectively 4 2 the joint probability distribution of p e and et c due to the negative correlation between p e and et c series with the kendall s rank coefficient τ of 0 11 fig 4 only three copula functions gaussian student t and frank were suitable to fit the joint probability distribution between them the estimated parameters and goodness of fit test of copula functions are given in table 5 the gaussian copula had the lowest aic and rmse with values of 362 4 and 0 0386 respectively therefore the gaussian copula was employed to construct the joint probability distribution of p e and et c series the joint density function and joint distribution function based on gaussian copula of p e and et c are shown in fig 6 previous research about risk analysis tended to consider three common archimedean copula functions gumbel hougaard frank and clayton copulas among which the gumbel and clayton functions had limited application because they could not describe the negative correlation between random variables ding et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 2017a 2017b zhao et al 2021 the gaussian and student t copula functions that derived from elliptical copula family can well fit multivariate extreme value distribution and non normal structure which were not restricted by the dependency range or dependency structure type between variables fang et al 2002 therefore the fitting results of three copula functions frank gaussian and student t copulas were compared for showing the optimal joint probability distribution of p e and et c series in this study finally the gaussian copula was selected as the optimal joint distribution which presented a better performance than the frank copula often selected as the optimal equation in previous research there are many kinds of copula models that have been gradually introduced into hydrological applications such as the palackette mixed and empirical copulas salvadori and de michele 2004 in future research more copula functions should be considered to reflect the dependence of water shortages variables 4 3 the joint probability analysis of p e and et c according to different states of pe and etc poor normal and rich nine encounter situations were obtained to analyze the natural water supply and demand situations as noted in table 6 the encounter probabilities of p e and et c were calculated and it could be divided into two situations the synchronous and asynchronous encounter probabilities among synchronous encounter probabilities the probability of the rich p e rich et c was equal to that of the poor p e poor et c with the value of 11 58 and the normal p e normal et c had the minimum probability value 6 34 among asynchronous encounter probabilities the probabilities of the pairs rich p e normal et c normal p e rich et c normal p e poor et c and poor p e normal et c were equivalent with the value of 9 33 whereas the probabilities of the extreme combinations rich p e poor et c and poor p e rich et c were maximum value compared with other pairs with the value of 16 59 the asynchronous encounter probability was higher two times than the synchronous encounter probability which indicated that the water supply and demand usually were in an uncoordinated state under natural precipitation conditions in arid or semi arid regions natural water shortages usually occurred due to low precipitation zhang et al 2017a 2017b indicated that the probability of asynchronous encounter situations was as 3 26 times as that of synchronous encounter situations in the luhun irrigation district of china zhao et al 2021 pointed out the probability of asynchronous encounter situations reached 76 85 in the guanzhong plain of china compared with these regions the precipitation is relatively abundant in the sichuan hilly area although the asynchronous encounter probability in the sichuan hilly area was lower than luhun irrigation district and guanzhong plain the imbalance of water supply and demand still occurred frequently under natural precipitation conditions the phenomenon might be caused by the precipitation with significantly interannual variation and the growing season of rape maize could not include the time period from the middle of august to the middle of september which has abundant precipitation besides engineering water shortage is one of the main reasons for water scarcity in the hilly area of southwest china if the precipitation in wet season can be effectively stored and utilized the water resource shortages will be alleviated hence making full use of water resources and taking engineering measures to adjust annual water use is necessary to solve local imbalance between supply and demand of agricultural water resources 4 4 conditional probability and return period analysis of p e and et c 4 4 1 conditional probability and return period of low p e high et c for various et c p e states there was a relatively high asynchronous encounter probability between et c and p e with value of 70 50 table 5 when p e is lower than a certain value or et c is higher than a certain value the crop growth might be restricted under natural precipitation conditions therefore the conditional probability and return period of p e without exceeding a certain value et c with exceeding a certain value for different et c p e states were analyzed detailed in section 2 3 4 fig 7 shows the conditional probability and return period of p e without exceeding a certain value for different et c states rich y y 37 5 normal y 62 5 y y 37 5 poor y y 62 5 the conditional probability gradually increased with rising p e while the return period decreased as shown in fig 7 a the conditional probability was the greatest when et c was in the rich state followed by the normal and poor states the raking of return period was opposite with that of the conditional probability fig 7 b further the conditional probability and return period of three typical values of p e were analyzed table 7 the results showed that the conditional probability for the general encounter situations of p e without exceeding a certain value under different et c states was relatively great so the natural agriculture water shortages might usually occur the conditional probability and return period of et c with exceeding a certain value for different p e states rich x x 37 5 normal x 62 5 x x 37 5 poor x x 62 5 are shown in fig 8 according to fig 8 a the conditional probability decreased with the increase of et c the poor p e state had the greatest conditional probability followed by the normal p e and rich p e states as noted in fig 8 b the return period for different p e states increased with the increase of et c the return period for the rich p e state was the greatest and the lowest return period was found in the poor p e state the conditional probability and return period of three typical values of et c were further explored and showed in table 8 the conditional probabilities of et c exceeding three typical values when p e was in different states were 30 88 69 12 which were relatively great indicating that the natural water supply p e generally could not satisfy the growth of rape maize for the same states of p e and et c the conditional probability was greater than the joint probability for example the conditional probability of poor p e for et c in the rich state was 44 24 and the joint probability of pair poor p e rich et c was 16 59 this was consistent with the results of zhang et al 2017a 2017b according to the marginal distribution of p e and et c fig 5 when the frequency of p e was higher than 50 p e 50 720 mm and et c was lower than 80 et c 80 720 mm p e was less than et c and the natural agriculture water shortages began to occur the joint probability of pair p e 720 mm et c 720 mm was 41 94 whereas the conditional probability of pairs p e 720 mm et c 720 mm et c 720 mm p e 720 mm reached 52 43 and 83 88 respectively conditional probability is the ratio of the joint probability to the edge probability which is less than 1 so the value of conditional probability is lower than joint probability the probability values of joint and conditional distribution differed greatly indicating that different encounter situations should be considered in irrigation planning in order to make full use of natural water resources and reduce agricultural water shortages risk 4 4 2 conditional probability and return period of low p e high et c with a given high et c low p e when p e is lower and et c is higher the water shortages are more likely to occur therefore the conditional probability and return period of low p e high et c under a given high et c low p e condition should be considered to analyze the extreme water shortages situations table 9 describes the low p e high et c values and the corresponding frequencies the low p e values corresponding to the frequency of 62 5 75 90 95 99 were 695 668 626 601 and 559 mm respectively the high et c values corresponding to the frequency of 1 5 10 25 37 5 were 850 821 794 779 and 764 mm respectively when et c was higher than a specific high value the conditional probability and return period of low p e without exceeding a certain value were expressed as p x x y y and t x x y y respectively similarly the conditional probability and return period of high et c with given low p e were given as p y y x x and t y y x x the conditional probability and return period of low p e with a given high et c are presented in fig 9 the conditional probability of low p e for five given et c situations the frequency of 1 5 10 25 and 37 5 increased following the increased p e but the corresponding return period decreased however for a certain frequency of p e the conditional probability decreased when the frequency of et c increased and the return period showed an inverse variation the conditional probabilities of p e 695 mm and p e 668 mm with different given high et c were 30 69 55 79 the greatest return period was 3 26 years and the lowest one was 1 79 years indicating that the situations of relatively low p e under high et c conditions might be common occurrence which would result in a natural water shortage in the sichuan hilly area when p e 626 mm and p e 601 mm with a given high et c the conditional probability was relatively lower and the return period was greater with values of 6 88 20 31 and 4 92 14 64 years respectively the p e with 99 frequency was 559 mm and it represented an extreme situation of natural water supply the condition joint probabilities of p e 559 mm for five given low et c frequency was less than 3 and the corresponding return period was higher than 34 years the results showed that an extreme encounter situation of low p e with a given high et c rarely occurred and there were barely extreme agriculture water shortages in the sichuan hilly area of china according to the low p e and high et c values in table 9 the conditional probability and return period of high et c for five given low p e were obtained fig 10 with the increased et c the conditional probability of high et c decreased whereas the return period gradually increased moreover the conditional probability for a specific et c increased with a rising p e frequency and the corresponding return period decreased when et c 764 mm and et c 779 mm the conditional probabilities for five given p e frequency were 44 24 55 79 and 30 69 41 19 respectively the corresponding return periods were 1 79 2 26 years and 2 4 3 26 years respectively the results showed that the situations of relatively high et c under low p e conditions might be common occurrence which would result in a natural agriculture water shortage in the sichuan hilly area the conditional probability of high et c with the frequency of 15 for different given low p e was 19 21 28 03 and the return period was 3 57 5 21 years when et c 821 mm the conditional probabilities with given 62 5 75 90 95 and 99 of p e were 6 88 7 48 8 73 9 61 and 11 53 respectively the greatest return period was 14 54 years and the lowest one was 8 67 years specially the value of et c with 1 frequency was 850 mm and the crops had higher demand for water under this frequency the conditional probability for different given p e frequency was 1 49 2 94 and the corresponding return period was 34 01 67 21 years when et c was an extremely high value the conditional probability with a given low p e was lower suggesting that an extreme mismatch between water supply and demand was almost impossible under natural precipitation conditions therefore the extremely low p e and high et c rarely occurred in the sichuan hilly area and a serious agriculture water shortage also was rare under natural precipitation conditions however with global climate change precipitation has decreased and reference evapotranspiration has increased in the southwest china liu and zhang 2013 sun et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 this research found natural water supply p e showed negative changes and water demand et c rarely changed in this context natural water shortages may become more frequent and serious in the sichuan hilly area southwest china experienced several serious drought in the 2000s qiu 2010 if water shortages continue to develop the hydrological droughts are likely to occur huang et al 2017 afshar et al 2020 hou et al 2021 therefore the risk analysis of different encounter situations of p e and et c was essential for regional water resources planning and management which has a positive effect on drought early warning to avoid serious economic losses 4 5 suggestion and expectation based on the encounter risk analysis of p e and et c for the growth period of rape maize the water supply and demand usually were in an uncoordinated state under natural precipitation conditions although agricultural water shortages risk was high under natural precipitation conditions a serious water shortage would rarely occur in the sichuan hilly area these results may be used to predict reasonable irrigation water consumption and formulate irrigation system which is significant for regional water resources management the hilly area of southwest china has relatively abundant precipitation and engineering water shortage is one of the main reasons for agricultural water shortages the administrative department of water resources should plan and construct more water conservancy facilities to optimize the allocation of regional water resources in the future we will focus on the natural water supply and demand situations in different growth periods of crops and the three dimension joint probability precipitation crop water requirement irrigation water will also be concerned to explore the regional water resource shortages 5 conclusions this study carried out a regional encounter risk analysis of natural agriculture water supply and demand in the typical hilly area of southwest china the data series of annual p e and et c of whole growth period of the rape maize were calculated based on the meteorological data in the sichuan hilly area from 1961 to 2017 the copula method was employed to build the joint probability distribution of p e and et c and then the encounter risk of different p e and et c states was analyzed the conclusions are given as follows the most reasonable marginal distributions of annual p e and et c were the lognormal and generalized extreme value distributions respectively the gaussian copula was the optimal joint distribution with aic of 362 4 and rmse of 0 0386 nine joint encounter situations were obtained based on the frequency of pk 62 5 and pf 37 5 among which the pairs of rich p e poor et c and poor p e rich et c had the highest probability with value of 16 59 the asynchronous encounter probability was higher two times than the synchronous encounter probability indicating that the natural water supply p e tended to be inconsistent with water demand et c the conditional probability of p e without exceeding a certain value for different et c states increased with increased p e however the conditional probability of et c with exceeding a certain value for different p e states presented an inverse regularity the conditional probability of p e without exceeding p e 37 5 p e 62 5 and p e average et c exceeding et c 37 5 et c 62 5 and et c average for different et c p e states was 44 97 69 12 and the corresponding return period was 1 45 2 22 year thus agricultural water shortages risk was high under natural precipitation conditions however the extreme combinations of lower p e and higher et c had lower conditional probability and longer return period showing a serious water shortage would rarely occur in the sichuan hilly area these will provide reference and guide to the regional water resource management and drought resistance credit

9552,there is a growing interest of using canopy temperature tc based methods including crop water stress index cwsi for irrigation management however different approaches exist to normalize tc to microclimatic conditions which can influence the accuracy and suitability of cwsi for irrigation scheduling this study evaluated the performance of cwsi computation approaches and their sensitivity to changes in soil water depletion under different water stress levels there were six different approaches two empirical methods using developed lower baseline i e cwsi eb1 cwsi eb2 two empirical methods using either artificial cwsi ea or actual natural cwsi en canopy reference surfaces and two theoretical approaches which differ by how aerodynamic and canopy resistances are determined cwsi th1 cwsi th2 stationary infrared thermometers irts provided continuous tc to calculate cwsi eb cwsi th and cwsi en whereas mobile irts and a thermal camera provided one point in time tc and temperatures of artificial canopy reference surfaces to calculate cwsi ea these measurements were all collected from full and deficit irrigated and rainfed maize plots in west central nebraska day to day variations within and across cwsi approaches were evident and their sensitivity to soil water depletion varied greater sensitivity and correlation strength to depletion d r i were observed with cwsi th and cwsi eb under severe stress i e d r i 80 at deeper soil depths of 1 8 and 2 1 m producing r2 which ranged from 0 61 to 0 80 slope 0 03 0 05 and 0 69 0 79 slope 0 03 0 04 respectively observed differences in stress magnitudes among approaches and treatments warrants a specific irrigation triggering threshold for each approach additionally developing a robust index coupling both cwsi and soil water depletion is desirable to improve irrigation water management by accounting for both soil and plant water status keywords canopy temperature irrigation scheduling infrared thermometers mobile sensing platform canopy reference surfaces soil water depletion west central nebraska 1 introduction shortages in water resources and high irrigation costs have prompted the use of water saving strategies as a way of improving water use efficiency and crop production luan et al 2021 han et al 2018a o shaughnessy et al 2017 efforts to use reclaimed blackwater in irrigation in addition to use of desalinated seawater in industries to have enough freshwater volumes for agricultural production might be impractical since high energy requirements and costs are involved with even poor water quality panagopoulos et al 2021 2020 nonetheless to improve agricultural water use real time detection of crop water status to optimize production per unit of applied water is needed han et al 2018b wang et al 2005 thus infrared thermometry can help in precise management of irrigation water since it enables continuous monitoring of crop water status with ability to integrate both soil water status and climatic conditions in addition it is less laborious and can be performed at larger spatial or temporal scales when compared to other techniques such as soil moisture sensors dejonge et al 2015 infrared thermometers irts measure canopy temperature tc which has received considerable attention in detecting and diagnosing crop water stress gonzalez dugo et al 2020 dejonge et al 2015 since it is non destructive and continuous and scalable from plant to field o shaughnessy et al 2017 2015 dejonge et al 2015 therefore tc has for a long time been used to monitor crop water stress either directly gardner et al 1981 or as an input to compute different stress indices dejonge et al 2015 idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 as well as to quantify crop evapotranspiration kullberg et al 2017 among the indices derived from tc the most common is the crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 1988 which has been found to be responsive to irrigation amounts around mid day hours taghvaeian et al 2014b in general cwsi is computed using eq 1 1 cwsi t c t a t cl t a t cu t a t cl t a where tc c is measured canopy temperature ta c is air temperature tcl c is canopy temperature of well transpiring or non stressed crop i e minimum tc and tcu c is the canopy temperature of a non transpiring or severely stressed crop i e maximum tc terms tcu ta and tcl ta are referred to as upper and lower limits or boundaries respectively different approaches have been established to compute cwsi however the choice of which approach to use depends on numerous factors including instrumentation and maintenance costs accuracy computational expense and or flexibility in collection of used temperatures the difference among the approaches is based upon how the upper and lower limits are determined essentially the upper limit is tended to represent the conditions of a water stressed crop whose canopy is no longer transpiring in contrast the lower limit expresses the conditions of a full transpiring and non stressed canopy these limits help to normalize tc to microclimatic conditions and can largely influence the accuracy of tc for stress detection maes et al 2016 furthermore these limits are often reported as being site specific but should be universal to simplify their use in deriving cwsi for irrigation scheduling taghvaeian et al 2014a most of the approaches used and proposed include an empirical approach idso et al 1981 a theoretical approach jackson et al 1981 1988 and use of canopy reference surfaces artificial or actual jones et al 2018 maes et al 2016 dejonge et al 2015 according to idso s empirical approach the lower baseline is developed as a linear regression relationship between differential temperature i e difference between non water stressed canopy and air temperatures tc ta and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd idso et al 1981 similarly the upper limit often referred to as water stressed baseline is estimated as a linear function of vapor pressure gradient han et al 2018a 2018b or as the observed maximum tc ta of a known highly stressed canopy some of the advantages with this approach is that it depends only on two variables in addition to the measured tc however the disadvantage with this method is that it depends on experimental data to establish a lower baseline and its accuracy is easily impacted by fluctuations in weather conditions this raises questions of its potential use in real time irrigation scheduling as well as transferability of the lower baseline to different climatic conditions payero and irmak 2006 wang et al 2005 additionally it also fails to account for net radiation and wind speed like the theoretical approach wang et al 2005 and it varies depending on crop type growth stage and climatic conditions because of its unstable lower baseline king et al 2021 dejonge et al 2015 taghvaeian et al 2014b to circumvent such challenges new ideas of using either artificial or natural canopy reference surfaces have been recommended jones et al 2018 maes et al 2016 dejonge et al 2015 for this approach temperatures of either actual canopy surface stressed vs non stressed or artificial canopy surfaces dry vs wet surfaces can be used to establish the limits ideally artificial surfaces are assumed to mimic the conditions of a non transpiring canopy by using a dry green fabric as well as a non stressed canopy by using a wet and fully soaked green fabric apolo apolo et al 2020 some of the common fabric materials used as artificial surfaces include polyester meron et al 2010 and cotton maes et al 2016 however the practicality of creating reference targets assumed to have same evaporative properties of crop leaves for irrigation scheduling or use in automated stress detection at a larger scale remains unproven maes et al 2016 on the other hand jackson et al 1981 also suggested use of energy balance equation relationships to model cwsi boundaries crop water stress index has been reported to be closely related to other stress indicators including leaf water potential king et al 2020 gonzalez dugo et al 2020 stem water potential romero trigueros et al 2019 osroosh et al 2016 soil water content or depletion dejonge et al 2015 kullberg et al 2017 and stomatal conductance lena et al 2020 gonzalez dugo et al 2019 as a result this has facilitated the use of cwsi in scheduling irrigation costa filho et al 2020 stockle and dugas 1992 for various crops such as sugar beet and grapes king et al 2020 sugarcane lebourgeois et al 2010 sorghum o shaughnessy et al 2012 wheat gontia and tiwari 2008 alderfasi and nielsen 2001 broccoli erdem et al 2010 and maize irmak et al 2000 payero and irmak 2006 to further promote the use of cwsi in automated water stress detection and irrigation systems it is beneficial to assess the performance of different approaches and their ability in reporting crop water stress as compared to soil water depletion understanding each approaches sensitivity to changes in soil water content and climatic conditions will help in determining the best cwsi approach for irrigation management this study aimed at having a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of both empirical and theoretical methods and their sensitivity to changes in soil water content between irrigated and non irrigated maize specific objectives included 1 computing cwsi from theoretical and empirical methods using stationary irts as well as thermal images and mobile irts 2 evaluating the performance of theoretical and empirical methods in comparison with soil water depletion and available soil water content under varying stress levels and 3 examining responses of cwsi to daily changes in soil water content with commonly used approaches i e cwsi th1 cwsi eb1 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design field data was collected in 2020 at the university of nebraska lincoln west central research extension and education center wcreec in north platte nebraska usa this region has a semi arid climate with 80 of annual precipitation occurring between late april and mid october payero et al 2009 the predominant soil at wcreec is cozad silt loam with field capacity of 0 29 m3 m 3 and permanent wilting point of 0 11 m3 m 3 klocke et al 1999 the experiment field uses a subsurface drip irrigation

blocks in a randomized complete block design rcbd with individual plot dimensions of 9 1 by 72 2 m however this study used only the three northern blocks due to limited sensor availability maize zea

usa seasonal irrigation was applied based on the full irrigation treatment applied up to twice a week when soil water depletion measured by neutron moisture meter nmm exceeded 50 of the maximum allowable depletion mad 2 2 data collection daily canopy temperature tc was continuously measured using stationary apogee si 1h1 irts apogee instruments logan utah usa the irts were installed on june 17 corresponding to approximately 70 of canopy cover in three replications of each treatment the irts were positioned at zenith angle of 45 towards the canopy in northeast direction and were adjusted weekly to maintain a height of 1 m above canopy temperatures were measured every 6 s averaged to 1 min and logged onto cr1000x dataloggers campbell scientific logan utah usa all stationary irts were calibrated by the manufacturer prior to field installation instantaneous tc was collected using four apogee si 1h1 irts and a flir duo pro r thermal camera flir wilsonville oregon us mounted on a mobile sensing platform fig 1 the sensing platform was driven parallel to the plant rows at a speed of 1 02 m s 1 and two interior rows were sensed the thermal camera with a global positioning system gps was installed 2 m above the canopy which was the height where both canopy and reference surfaces could be observed pointed at nadir view whereas each pair of the irts were positioned 1 m above the canopy pointing 45 towards maize rows and logged tc after every 0 5 s on cr1000x datalogger all irts were calibrated by the manufacturer prior to their use on the platform the sensing platform also carried artificial canopy reference surfaces and an external differential gps dgps receiver holland scientific lincoln nebraska usa which was used for geo locating and processing of collected data two thermal images were taken in the middle of each plot with dry and wet artificial canopy reference surfaces in the field of view fabricated using green florist styrofoam bricks continuous temperatures

measured tc by irts and those provided by thermal images was important during the quality data assurance of temperatures extracted from thermal images soil volumetric water content θv was measured at depths of 15 300 cm at increments of 30 cm using cpn 503 elite hydroprobe and cpn 503dr neutron moisture meters nmms instrotek concord california usa a local gravimetric calibration was conducted producing coefficient of determination r2 of 0 977 and root mean square error rmse of 0 010 m3 m 3 in order to convert the count ratios to θv lo et al 2020 to capture soil water dynamics two aluminum access tubes were installed on either side of the crop row at distance of 0 19 m in each plot or treatment replication one tube was 0 15 m and the other 0 57 m from the drip tape to capture water distribution in both dry and wet rows the average readings between the two tubes were used in the subsequent analyses daily meteorological data 1 min resolution was obtained from the onsite nebraska climate office weather station under nebraska mesonet https mesonet unl edu located 100 m from the experimentation site collected data included air temperature ta c relative humidity rh solar radiation rs w m 2 wind speed u2 m s 1 and precipitation p mm vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated using ta and rh allen et al 1998 all variables were measured at 2 m height except windspeed which was measured at 3 m but adjusted to 2 m following technique described by allen et al 1998 2 3 crop water stress index calculations as shown in fig 2 different approaches can be used to compute crop water stress index eq 2a with measured canopy temperatures of both stressed and non stressed canopy and or for the targeted treatment as well as temperatures of artificial canopy surfaces mimicking the transpiration potential of the actual canopy under study the methods are different based upon how the upper and lower limits are determined according to jackson et al 1988 the limits create boundaries within which the measured canopy temperatures can be normalized 2 3 1 empirical approach using meteorological data cwsi eb1 cwsi eb2 the empirical approach was introduced by idso et al 1981 and it has been commonly used for computing cwsi eq 2a han et al 2018b dejonge et al 2015 irmak et al 2000 therefore this was referred to as cwsi eb whereby eb implies empirical establishment of lower baseline as shown in fig 2 empirical lower baseline a k a non stressed baseline tc ta l is determined as a linear regression between differential temperature tc ta and vpd as shown in eq 2b where tc is collected from a non stressed fully watered crop with regards to the upper baseline tc ta u eq 2c it can be determined following two methods 1 using tc collected from a stressed crop e g rainfed treatment over a wide range of vpd and maximum observed tc ta is considered as the upper limit eq 2 dejonge et al 2015 and 2 using eq 2d which is different from eq 2c since it uses vpg instead of vpd han et al 2018a yuan et al 2004 first method using the upper limit with eq 2c was referred to as cwsi eb1 and second using eq 2d was termed as cwsi eb2 2a cwsi t c t a a t c t a l t c t a u t c

deficit assuming leaf temperature is equal to air temperature and vpg kpa is the difference between the saturation vapor pressure evaluated at air temperature ta and at a higher air temperature equal to air temperature plus a i e ta a 2 3 2 theoretical approach cwsi th1 and cwsi th2 the upper and upper limits following the theoretical approach of jackson et al 1981 and jackson et al 1988 were computed using eq 3a and eq 3b respectively as presented in fig 2 this approach was referred to as cwsi th in this paper calculated using the limits and eq 2a under section 2 3 1 the upper limit of tc ta is calculated when rc is allowed to increase to infinity or without bound thus getting to eq 3a the lower limit of tc ta is established by assuming that the canopy resistance is equal to achieved canopy resistance at potential transpiration of well watered canopy surface rc rcp thus getting to eq 3b however there are two ways of calculating theoretical cwsi which are based upon the different procedures of computing both aerodynamic and canopy resistances han et al 2018a first method cwsi th1 is computed by considering eq 3c to compute aerodynamic resistance jackson et al 1988 and assuming potential canopy resistance to be equal to zero i e rcp 0 whereby canopy transpiration is assumed to be equal to evaporation of a free water surface jackson et al 1981 1988 second method cwsi th2 uses seasonal averages of ra r a eq 3d and rcp r cp eq 3e as suggested by o toole and real 1986 cwsi th2 has been used and convincingly performed well as indicated by han et al 2018a and clawson et al 1989

canopy reference surfaces cwsi en cwsi ea to improvise simple methods of determining limits due to challenges of developing idso s empirical and inaccuracies from estimated limits with jackson s theoretical method tc of both well irrigated and a stressed crop as well as temperatures of dry and wet artificial canopy reference surfaces can be used apolo apolo et al 2020 maes et al 2016 meron et al 2010 while using the actual canopy surface upper and lower limits are obtained as differential temperature using tc from a non water stressed canopy at potential transpiration tcl and a water stressed canopy without transpiration tcu respectively eqs 4a 4b this approach is similar to how other stress indices are derived such as degrees above non stress canopy dans dejonge et al 2015 or temperature stress day tsd gardner et al 1981 on the other hand artificial canopy surfaces can be used by using temperatures of wet soaked fabric twet and a dry fabric tdry made from green styrofoam fig 1 upper and lower limits are calculated as differences between ta and temperatures of wet and dry styrofoam surfaces respectively eqs 4c and 4d however the cwsi can be simplified as presented in eq 4e after substituting eqs 4a 4d in eq 2a under section 2 3 1 cwsi calculated with actual canopy temperatures and artificial canopy reference temperatures were referred to as cwsi en and cwsi ea respectively 4a t c t a l t cl t a 4b t c t a u t cu t a 4c t c t a l t wet t a 4d t c t a u t dry t a 4e cwsi t c t cl t cu t cl or cwsi t c t wet t dry t wet where tcu c is the temperature of stressed canopy upper limit tcl is temperature of non stressed canopy lower limit twet c and tdry c is the temperature of wet and dry artificial canopy reference surfaces respectively 2 4 data preparation and water stress calculations 2 4 1 thermal images provide artificial canopy surface temperatures desktop software known as flir tools flir systems wilsonville or version 5 13 was used to extract both tc and temperatures of artificial canopy reference surfaces from the thermal images within the flir tool software working environment adjustments were made to reflect the normal environmental conditions by adjusting rh to what was measured by the onsite weather station and emissivity for both reference and canopy surfaces was set to 0 98 maes et al 2016 agam et al 2013 to determine accurate temperatures of the surfaces a total of 160 temperature points were selected from the actual sunlit canopy surfaces within a thermal image and 80 temperature points for each of the artificial canopy reference surfaces wet and dry surfaces data for all selected points were automatically exported from the flir tools working environment and then averaged for each surface and plot using microsoft excel microsoft ca usa for quality assurance of temperatures extracted from thermal images tc from both thermal images and mobile irts were compared to observe how close the values are to each other similarly temperatures of artificial canopy reference surfaces extracted from thermal images were compared to what was measured by thermocouples spatial filtering and averaging of tc collected by the four mobile irts within a clipped length of 10 7 m in the middle of each plot was done using microsoft excel s visual basic microsoft ca usa and open source geoprocessing software qgis desktop 3 12 3 qgis developers gruet switzerland median tc values from each of the four apogee irts were calculated and then averaged to a single tc first by plot and finally by treatment hence single tc value for each treatment was used to compute cwsi ea for each treatment on any field sensing campaign day 2 4 2 water stress calculations field collected continuous 1 min tc from stationary irts and weather variables were averaged over 15 min timestep however 15 min tc was done by plot and after averaged by treatment thus mean 15 min tc for each treatment was used in the subsequent daily cwsi calculations furthermore used tc was collected at mid day for selected hot days with clear sky for 4 hr period from solar noon i e 1200 1600 h central daytime eventually calculated 15 min cwsi was averaged over hourly and then to daily cwsi conversely for instantaneous cwsi as for cwsi ea average temperatures tc twet and tdry collected from mobile sensing platform using mobile irts and thermal camera across treatment plots were averaged by treatment on any field sensing campaign day among the used cwsi methods included those which provided daily cwsi values as well as one which provided instantaneous cwsi values typically on any field sensing campaign day therefore as illustrated in fig 2 under section 2 3 daily cwsi was computed using three methods empirical with developed lower baseline i e cwsi eb1 and cwsi eb2 using eqs 2a 2d section 2 3 1 theoretical i e cwsi th1 and cwsi th2 using eqs 3b 3e section 2 3 2 and empirical actual canopy reference surfaces i e cwsi en using eqs 4a 4b and 4e section 2 3 3 whereas instantaneous cwsi was computed still using empirical approach but with artificial canopy reference surfaces i e cwsi ea using eqs 4c 4e section 2 3 3 however comparison between all methods was conducted into two separate ways one by comparing only cwsi approaches which provided daily estimates i e only three approaches and second way involved matching values from these three approaches to those of instantaneous cwsi approach on similar dates of field sensing campaigns with purpose to accommodate cwsi ea on the other hand it is worth noting that lower baseline for cwsi eb was developed empirically as explained in section 2 3 1 but considering tc of fully irrigated treatment on days following either irrigation or precipitation events since wetting events allow for non water limiting conditions with regards to cwsi en the lower limit tcl was determined using the minimum achieved tc of fully irrigated treatments around solar noon period on days following irrigation or precipitation events in contrast upper limit tcu was achieved as maximum tc across rainfed treatments with matched days as of tcl additionally the limits for cwsi ea were determined by artificial canopy reference surfaces where tcl and tcu were equal to temperatures of wet and dry surfaces respectively 2 5 soil water depletion and available soil water content to compare cwsi to soil water dynamics each method was matched to estimated soil water depletion or soil water content on that same day according to allen et al 1998 daily root zone soil water depletion can be computed based on a soil water balance swb equation as presented in eq 6a using previous depletion dr i evapotranspiration et irrigation applied i and precipitation p because of limited amount of rainfall received in the two months of july and august runoff r and deep percolation dp were assumed to be non existent and thus equal to zero and the upward flux u was also assumed negligible daily crop evapotranspiration i e etc was also computed following fao56 single crop coefficient method daily etc daily kc daily etr allen et al 1998 where daily kc was computed from the developed kc curve for each treatment using the following steps first weekly etc was computed using weekly swb eq 6b from nmm measurements second daily alfalfa reference et etr was calculated using local weather station data and modified penman monteith equation asce 2005 and then summed over a week to align with weekly swb etc after which kc values on each nmm date i e weekly kc was computed as a ratio of weekly swb etc and weekly etr and then interpolated to seasonal kc values by fitting a fourth order polynomial function with cumulative growing degree days cgdds colaizzi et al 2017 rudnick and irmak 2014 furthermore modeled profile depletion eq 6a was corrected with actual depletion on days with nmm measurements which was computed using eq 6c 6a d r i 1 d r i et i r i dp i u i p i i i 6b et c p i u r dp s 6c d r i z x θ fc θ obs where d r i 1 is the root zone soil water deficit of the current day i 1 based on previous day i etc mm is crop evapotranspiration s mm is change in soil water storage and it was measured using nmms θ obs is observed or measured volumetric water content with nmm m3 m 3 θ fc is the field capacity m3 m 3 and zx 300 mm is the thickness of the soil layer x 2 6 analyzing soil water dynamics with cwsi approaches to examine the sensitivity of the cwsi approaches to soil water dynamics a linear plateau model fig 3 was established on scatter plot data of cwsi versus percentage soil water depletion d r i computed using eq 7 payero and irmak 2006 three hypothetical stress levels were considered no stress i e dr i 50 moderate stress i e 50 d r i 80 and high stress i e d r i 80 as illustrated in the fig 3 the sensitivity response of cwsi to d r i was assessed depending on the coefficient of determination r2 and slope at a significance level of 0 05 therefore any approach with low r2 and low slope was regarded to have low sensitivity while high r2 and high slope indicated strong sensitivity to d r i on the other hand daily cwsi specifically cwsi th1 cwsi eb1 and cwsi en were evaluated to daily changes in available soil water content after depletion due to crop et or addition of irrigation or precipitation cwsi th1 and cwsi eb1 were particularly selected because they are more commonly used methods in exploring potential use of cwsi in irrigation scheduling king et al 2020 han et al 2018a o shaughnessy et al 2012 7 d r i d r i taw i where dr i is the soil water depletion in the crop root zone on day i mm taw i is the maximum amount of water that can be depleted from the active root zone on day i mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation management and soil water measurements the 2020 maize growing season was a dry year with seasonal rainfall of 199 mm below the long term 1980 2020 average of 450 mm based on weather dataset of the nebraska mesonet https mesonet unl edu it was also a hot year with average ta of 4 c and 5 c above the long term average of 24 c and 23 c in the months of july and august respectively therefore increased temperature contributed to much lower rh but higher vpd all this contributing to increased crop et and seasonal irrigation requirements fig 4a as shown in table 1 august received less rainfall as compared to july these months are known for high peak crop water demand as the crop transitions into the reproductive period soil water content was greatest in fully irrigated maize plots than in deficit irrigated and rainfed maize plots fig 2b due to higher irrigation amounts fig 4a as a result lower average tc was observed on hot days around solar noon when ta 28 c in fully irrigated treatment and it was 3 c and 5 c lower than that of deficit and rainfed treatments respectively changes in soil water dynamics were well tracked with nmm and swb model in all treatments fig 4b 3 2 artificial canopy reference surfaces temperatures for establishing the limits temperatures of the artificial canopy reference surfaces were measured using both thermocouples and thermal images to have confidence in using thermal images to provide artificial canopy reference surface temperatures tc measured by both the mobile irts and thermal images were compared there was a good agreement between the tc measured from the two sources as presented in fig 5 there was a strong relationship between mobile irt and thermal image tc with r2 equal to 0 81 and root mean square error rmse of 1 21 c discrepancies between the mobile and thermal image tc values could be due to sensor type and difference in positioning i e irts were oblique at 45 whereas thermal camera was nadir at 90 also this might have been due to mobile irts taking tc measurements from patches of shaded canopy as well as existence of very cold pixels within the thermal image providing lower tc compared to average tc measured by mobile irts artificial canopy reference surface temperatures i e twet for wet surface and tdry for dry surface measured by thermocouples and thermal images were also compared based on the thermocouple measurements the average twet was 27 7 c compared to 45 4 c for tdry as presented in fig 6a and as expected the dry surface had higher temperatures 40 50 c 25th 75th percentile range than the wet surface 25 30 c 25th 75th percentile range however from the two sources of temperatures thermocouples and thermal images differences in temperatures were not only observed across sensing dates but also between measurement options thermocouples versus median and or average temperatures extracted from thermal images fig 6b c this was because thermocouples measured temperatures of both surfaces at a single point however with thermal images temperatures were manually extracted at different points along the surfaces there was high variability in extracted temperatures attributed to shading of the canopy and spatial differences in soil water content indeed spatial variability of temperatures from thermal images were also seen by luan et al 2021 who suggested the average of temperatures above the 50 percentile are useful as they provided cwsi values that correlated well with other water stress indicators for all field sensing campaign dates except july 31 the average values from the three methods were similar by 1 c and 2 c with the wet and dry artificial canopy reference surfaces respectively for the case of the thermocouples temperature variabilities can be attributed to sensing direction i e difference in incoming rs interception as well as measurement depth i e measurements for images taken on the surface whereas a few mm from the surface for thermocouples a linear relationship between temperatures of thermal images by averaging values i e average thermal and thermocouples produced a weak relationship for both wet artificial surface r2 0 15 with rmse of 2 2 c and dry artificial surface r2 0 28 with rmse of 6 2 c data not shown temperatures from the wet surface twet and dry surface tdry were used to determine the lower limit and upper limit respectively fig 7 the tdry was considerably higher than the stressed rainfed canopy temperature as shown in fig 7 with mean difference of about 15 6 c in all sensing campaign days the large difference between the natural and artificial surface suggests that either or a combination of the dry artificial canopy surface failed to capture the actual temperature of the stressed canopy or the natural surface was not near non transpiring conditions whereas the wet surface was better in capturing the temperature of the non stressed canopy since both temperatures seemed to have been close with a mean difference of about 1 4 c across the field campaign days therefore such temperature differences highly contribute to observable differences within the calculated cwsi likewise tdry differences between different approaches were observed by wang et al 2005 when theoretical stressed tc estimated by jackson theoretical method jackson et al 1988 was compared to imitated stressed canopy created by coating thin glue on the actual leaf to close the stomata additionally other studies have also used tdry by assuming it to be higher than air temperature by 5 c i e tdry ta 5 c in absence of a dry surface ben gal et al 2009 irmak et al 2000 according to maes et al 2016 wet artificial reference surface light green 100 cotton fabric and 0 5 mm thickness can be used instead of using a manually wetted leaf surfaces if it is continuously wetted and from their analysis there was temperature difference of about 0 8 0 4 c between the wet artificial surface and wetted leaf surfaces nonetheless careful determination of these temperatures is necessary since from a simple sensitivity analysis of tdry and twet on cwsi it showed that if twet is estimated to be higher than tc the crop is assumed to be non stressed i e low cwsi values even when there is large soil water depletion similarly when tdry is estimated to be close to or less than tc the crop is assumed to be stressed i e high cwsi values even under adequate soil water content durigon and de jong van lier 2013 3 3 canopy and differential temperatures in irrigated and non irrigated maize daily continuous canopy temperatures tc measured by stationary irts on clear and sunny days at mid day period 1200 1600 h were used to compute differential temperature between tc and ta thereafter cumulative frequency curves were developed fig 8a b therefore maize crop response to irrigation was reflected in both tc fig 8a and differential temperature tc ta fig 8b and variability was distinct between the irrigated full deficit and non irrigated rainfed treatments for both tc and tc ta cumulative frequency curves all exhibited similar trends however the rainfed curve shifted more towards the right as compared to the curves for irrigated maize canopy which were quite similar to each other due to small difference in their measured tc according to dejonge et al 2015 tc for corn can be categorized into three levels as tcmean 27 c 27 c tcmean 29 c and tcmean 29 c representing non stressed marginally stressed and highly stressed canopy respectively illustrated in fig 8a and they are based on tcritical of 28 c which was suggested as a threshold for maize stress peters and evett 2004 2008 therefore these ranges were identified clearly around 30 of the tc across the treatments fig 8a it was also noted that in general on days when average mid day ta was above 30 c rainfed tc was above tcritical when a crop was undergoing some stress conversely the median range of tc at 50 was 28 8 c for full irrigation treatment followed by deficit at 29 c and finally 30 3 c for rainfed maximum tc in rainfed was higher by 6 3 c and 3 9 c in comparison to full and deficit irrigated treatments respectively similarly the median values of tc ta at 50 ranged from 2 1 c for full irrigation treatment to 1 8 c for deficit and 0 2 c for rainfed based on the minimum tc ta at 0 15 and maximum tc ta at 100 across treatments tc ta ranged from 5 8 4 6 c 5 7 4 9 c and 5 5 8 6 c in fully irrigated deficit irrigated and rainfed maize respectively however maximum calculated value of tc ta in rainfed exceeded 8 c which was high as compared to the irrigated treatments with their maximum values less than 5 c the high tc ta values observed from rainfed treatment helps support the use of rainfed tc to find a suitable upper limit king et al 2021 this particular season had above normal temperatures as well as below normal rainfall however caution should be exercised when applying this approach for cool and wet years according to gonzalez dugo et al 2014 on a hot day where average ta 30 c tc ta can increase early in the day even before solar noon if the stress levels are high and it can also easily fluctuate with instant changes in evaporative demand and solar radiation in the afternoons nevertheless deficit and full irrigated maize canopy had a low tc ta due to water sufficiency however rainfed maize canopy had exceptionally high tc ta because water was limiting greater tc ta in rainfed maize can be attributed to water stress and reduced transpiration rates from partial stomatal closure gonzalez dugo et al 2014 baker et al 2013 usually tc ta 0 indicates a cooler canopy with less stress which is a good condition for developing a lower baseline whereas tc ta 0 indicates a stressed canopy with higher tc in relation to ta gonzalez dugo et al 2014 observations between tc ta and cwsi with baselines made by kirnak et al 2019 indicated that when tc ta was negative then cwsi 1 and when tc ta was positive then cwsi 1 3 4 empirical baselines using meteorological data and daily continuous tc a non stressed baseline was developed from fully irrigated maize using the daily mid day tc for hot and clear days following irrigation events the developed baseline showed a strong linear relationship between tc ta and vpd tc ta 1 37 x vpd 1 82 r2 0 81 as presented in fig 9 however the strength of this regression can be influenced by the weather fluctuations and variability stockle and dugas 1992 and fluctuation in tc gonzalez dugo et al 2014 as well as the et potential between non stressed and stressed crop gontia and tiwari 2008 additionally the baseline had a negative slope and a positive intercept which is common for most of the developed baselines in semi arid climates gonzalez dugo et al 2020 the upper baseline for cwsi eb1 was 5 c whereas the upper baseline for cwsi eb2 ranged from 3 3 to 8 4 c over a wide range of vpd of 0 9 4 7 kpa while using cwsi eb approach the cwsi 1 can occur especially when there are fluctuations in atmospheric demand and soil moisture conditions which cause the actual tc ta to be greater than the upper baseline dejonge et al 2015 the limitation with this method is that it is very sensitive to weather and easily surpasses the expected range of cwsi i e 0 cwsi 1 which makes the interpretation of values sometimes challenging however negative values are interpreted as crop being non stressed and values greater than 1 indicate that the crop is severely stressed dejonge et al 2015 one of the advantages of this approach is that it can provide continuous and daily estimates of the stress levels which makes water stress diagnosis much easier 3 5 comparing cwsi approaches calculated daily cwsi on identified clear and sunny days varied for all approaches under different water sufficiency levels during the 2020 growing season with low values in irrigated treatments and high values in rainfed treatment fig 10 such differences are depicting the influence of frequent irrigation events to manage water stress in irrigated treatments all cwsis exhibited the same pattern with slightly lower values in full than in deficit treatment and higher values between irrigated and rainfed treatment however there was minimal differences in cwsi eb approaches cwsi eb1 cwsi eb2 regardless of the treatment in addition cwsi th had higher values as compared to other approaches across treatments particularly cwsi th2 which registered the highest values especially in rainfed treatment with theoretical approach cwsi th1 ranged between 0 1 and 1 5 and cwsi th2 between 0 7 and 1 6 whereas with empirical approach using developed lower baselines ranged from 0 4 to 1 0 and 0 9 to 1 1 for cwsi eb1 and cwsi eb2 respectively lastly the cwsi en which was calculated using actual temperatures of the stressed i e rainfed and non stressed i e fully irrigated canopies to establish the limits the values ranged from 0 1 to 1 0 it is described in fig 10 that cwsi increases with increase in stress from full to deficit and then rainfed settings it is worth noting that there was a narrower seasonal range with cwsi eb methods and cwsi en as compared to cwsi th under irrigated treatments indicating that cwsi th can be used under mildly stressed conditions observed differences in stress magnitudes shown by all approaches under same treatments i e cwsi th overestimated stress when compared to cwsi eb and cwsi en suggest developing a specific stress triggering threshold for each approach as presented in fig 10 cwsi th s i e cwsi th1 and cwsi th2 exceeded 1 and cwsi eb s i e cwsi eb1 and cwsi eb2 had negative values which is contrary to what was recommended by researchers who introduced cwsi and reported a range of 0 1 idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 1988 it is not surprising that some of the cwsi eb values were negative and this has also been observed in other studies that have used empirical baselines to calculate cwsi dejonge et al 2015 cwsi th tended to overestimate stress with high values as similarly observed by han et al 2018a and agam et al 2013 however this can be due to a cooler lower baseline fig 7 or uncertainties around the computation of aerodynamic resistance han et al 2018a whereas cwsi eb underestimated stress with low and negative values dejonge et al 2015 typically at mid day time when 0 1 cwsi 0 5 the crop is assumed to be stressed cwsi 0 5 moderately stressed and severely stressed when cwsi 1 0 dejonge et al 2015 however because of magnitude differences of cwsi values reported across approaches these stress ranges might change or vary depending on which approach is being used in cotton crop cwsi eb was found to vary so much and cwsi th was stable when the water stress was absent stockle and dugas 1992 also ben gal et al 2009 recommended theoretical method since it does not require a wet or dry reference surface in order to compare cwsi ea calculated for only the sensing campaign dates with other approaches a box plot fig 11 was developed by selecting the cwsi values for other approaches which matched the same field sensing campaign dates as cwsi ea this allowed to compare all theoretical to all empirical methods such that all common methods used in cwsi computations are presented there was a smaller range of cwsi values among empirical baselines and empirical natural surfaces than as seen with cwsi th however distributions were wider with cwsi th1 and cwsi en as compared with cwsi th2 with regards to cwsi eb and cwsi ea minimal differences were seen especially in irrigated treatments however there was a slightly larger difference among these two approaches in the rainfed treatment in rainfed treatment the mean values of cwsi th1 and cwsi eb s were close to the maxima since extremely large tc measurements become more prevalent as stress increases fig 8 the varying cwsi values from low in irrigated treatments to then high in rainfed treatment shows the relevance of water sufficiency in controlling stress in maize overall the values of cwsi th1 commonly used and cwsi en were higher in comparison to other approaches as also observed by han et al 2018b cwsi th1 approach provided higher ranges of cwsi hence failing to report non stressed periods in addition it tended to overestimate crop water stress correct estimation of aerodynamic resistance remains a challenge and directly impacts the limits used to determine water stress also the assumption of the canopy resistance to be equal to zero i e rcp 0 when determining the lower limit for cwsi th2 might not apply under certain weather conditions and this can cause a huge shift in cwsi values therefore cwsi th1 might require a higher threshold approx 0 3 0 6 to identify stress for irrigation scheduling 3 6 sensitivity of cwsi approaches to soil water depletion under varying stress levels this section focused on the sensitivity of the cwsi to percentage soil water depletion i e d r i under different water stress levels and different soil depths this was based on developing linear relationships at two shallow depths of 0 6 and 0 9 m and two deeper depths of 1 8 and 2 1 m fig 12 table 2 the level of sensitivity of cwsi to d r i was analyzed based on the slope of the regressions as well as understanding the strength of the correlation at 0 05 level of significance as summarized in table 2 the slope represented the increase in stress indicated by cwsi when there was an increase in soil water depletion by 1 as presented in fig 12 at deeper depths regardless of the approach used cwsi was observed to be sensitive to depletion above 80 and the strength of the correlation was much greater under high stress from table 2 cwsi th2 had the highest sensitivity to d r i since it had the highest slope of 0 05 at 2 1 m soil depth in addition the increase in sensitivity was in the order of cwsi th2 cwsi eb2 cwsi th1 cwsi eb1 cwsi en at 2 1 m and cwsi th2 cwsi eb1 cwsi eb2 cwsi th1 cwsi en at 1 8 m soil depth on the other hand the strength of the relationships varied even when approaches had similar or close slopes approaches which were most sensitive also exhibited stronger correlations at 2 1 m more so cwsi th and cwsi eb which had significant p value 0 05 and positive correlation ranging from r2 of 0 59 0 80 greater strength was indicated in cwsi eb1 r2 0 74 cwsi eb2 r2 0 79 and cwsi th1 which had a higher r2 of 0 80 whereas lower strength was shown by cwsi th2 and cwsi en with significant r2 equal to 0 61 and 0 59 respectively table 2 in contrast it was interesting to observe that at shallow depths cwsi approaches failed to show expected trends under moderate and high stress levels especially at 0 6 m with all methods exhibiting weaker relationships r2 0 5 as well as sensitivity to d r i probably because the rooting zone was situated at deeper depths and there were no signals in canopy temperatures due to changes in soil moisture in the topsoil as also observed by dejonge et al 2015 it is common to see weak correlations r2 0 5 between empirical baselines when a linear relationship is developed between cwsi and soil water depletion mm after using peak tc at 1500 hr in greeley colorado from the results it can be argued that for cwsi to be reliably used for detecting stress or even deciding the right timing of irrigation the crop must be under serious stress when d r i 80 thus it might fail to identify stress under moderate stress i e 50 d r i 80 however under no stress conditions fig 12 high cwsi values for cwsi th1 cwsi th2 and cwsi en were observed and strongly correlated to d r i at deeper soil depths consequently this might be confused with actual stress but rather it is due to outliers influenced by weather fluctuations i e stress is induced under extremely hot day even when there is adequate soil moisture thus such observations might be contributed by other factors mainly variabilities within weather conditions but not changes in soil water dynamics for example the crop will show signs of stress under very high ta and rs which cause stomates to close and eventually curling of leaves even when there is adequate soil water zhang et al 2021 hence cwsi th and cwsi eb can perform satisfactorily under severe stress however at moderate stress cwsi ebs performed poorly which implies that such approach might fail to identify stress as indicated by soil water measurements similarly han et al 2018a reported good relationships between the cwsi eb and cwsi th with the sap flow measurements according to han et al 2018b total available water can be accurately estimated using cwsi eb1 from continuously measured tc to improve estimation of soil water depletion with soil water balance model this section has provided some proof for recommending cwsi eb and cwsi th approaches over others for monitoring water stress however confidence in cwsi relative to soil water depletion was greatest when soil water depletion exceeded 80 which is likely past most recommended irrigation scheduling management zones in addition further analysis is required to assess the impact of weather variability on cwsi sensitivity from the simple analysis done in this study data not shown weather had less influence on cwsi sensitivity as compared to soil water availability lastly utilization of a daily soil water balance model can contribute to errors when establishing stress levels thus it might be beneficial to deploy locally calibrated soil moisture sensors for constant monitoring of soil water status singh et al 2021 3 7 comparing daily changes in cwsi to available soil water content as demonstrated in the literature and in the present study cwsi tends to increase as soil water content decreases which has prompted the use of cwsi in scheduling irrigation but the questions remain 1 how sensitive is cwsi to soil water content drawdowns or water addition in the soil profile and 2 can cwsi reliably infer stress without monitoring soil moisture in the profile for most of july and august cwsi failed to respond to changes in soil water across treatments fig 13 at times cwsi would increase without soil water drawdown or after few days of irrigation and rainfall among irrigated treatments cwsi th1 and cwsi eb1 were not responsive to changes in soil water content when above 350 mm but were responsive below 350 mm especially in august when considering a rooting depth of 2 1 m as noted in red circles cwsi th1 and cwsi eb1 were able to capture changes in soil water content due to irrigation precipitation or et overall there was less response of cwsi th1 and cwsi eb1 shown by the trends of cwsi versus available soil water fig 13 in irrigated treatments as compared to rainfed treatment han et al 2018b emphasized that cwsi th can fail to respond to irrigation events and distinguish stress responses at key growth stages due to fluctuations in aerodynamic resistances the uncertainty of cwsi eb is influenced by the intercept of non water stress baselines han et al 2018b and dominant low vpd conditions stockle and dugas 1992 also cwsi eb can delay showing stress which complicates meeting the irrigation needs in real time stockle and dugas 1992 despite the fact that cwsi has been used as an irrigation scheduling tool since it supports automation of data collection with minimal efforts king et al 2020a still there are ambiguities with its response to soil water depletion or available soil water content in most instances when irrigation was added shown by spikes in soil water graph all cwsi approaches unfortunately did not drop immediately probably due to time lag of stressed crops to recover quickly jackson et al 1981 therefore jackson 1982 concluded that it is very difficult to infer available soil water content from canopy temperatures alone because of different factors involved such as recovery periods after irrigation or precipitation root growth and volume and the plant senescence especially in late reproductive stages of maize in addition cwsi is also impacted by the evaporative demand and if it exceeds the ability of the roots to mine water from the profile then cwsi possibly increase without any change in available soil water deficit as it exceeds maximum allowable depletion 3 8 discussion and future research this study has contributed to a comprehensive assessment among most suggested cwsi approaches and their sensitivity to soil water depletion over a range of water stress conditions the differences in stress magnitude of approaches across treatments warrant different irrigation triggering thresholds for each approach if they are to be implemented in irrigation scheduling likewise other studies have observed similar differences particularly with cwsi th and cwsi eb such as han et al 2018a with three approaches cwsi th1 cwsi th2 cwsi eb2 yuan et al 2004 with three approaches cwsi th1 cwsi eb1 cwsi alves model and erdem et al 2010 with cwsi eb1 however based on a study done by han et al 2018a cwsi th2 and cwsi eb2 gave reasonable estimate of water stress measured by sap flow a water stress indicator which directly measure actual transpiration of the crop but cwsi th1 overestimated water stress and failed to correctly respond to irrigation events in addition the increase in cwsi values occurred when there was an increase in water stress and this was also observed by yuan et al 2004 with cwsi th1 and cwsi eb1 which both correlated well to other water stress indicators such as leaf water potential stomatal resistance and leaf net photosynthesis larger fluctuations were seen in theoretical than in empirical approaches however it was the opposite with findings from yuan et al 2004 who suggested theoretical over empirical approach for practical use in irrigation scheduling in full irrigation management cwsi eb approaches fluctuated around cwsi 0 as also observed by erdem et al 2010 thus proving its ability to quantify stress under minimal stress levels erdem et al 2010 on the other hand preliminary analysis data not shown showed that weather fluctuations might have less influence on the sensitivity of both cwsi th1 and cwsi eb1 to soil water depletion however further in depth analysis is required to have conclusive findings about weather impacts on the sensitivity according to other studies such as king et al 2021 and han et al 2018a weather conditions might impact the accuracy of cwsi when correlated to other water stress indicators it is claimed that at windspeed 6 m s 1 the tc data might not be useful to calculate cwsi because the canopy resistance is already impacted or compromised as high wind speeds can reduce stomatal conductance and transpiration rate thus increasing tc under adequate soil water content king et al 2021 furthermore when computing cwsi eb the choice of method to determine the upper limit matters and from this study the limits were seen to have varied amongst the methods lebourgeois et al 2010 emphasized that using tc of stressed treatment as an upper limit might be a wrong approach since the crop can still be transpiring yet to have accurate cwsi it is advised to use tc of a non transpiring canopy only achieved by manually closing the stomata however a rainfed treatment can still be used since it undergoes severe stress without transpiring for the most part of the season during drought conditions lebourgeois et al 2010 different thermal camera setups can be used to collect tc including handheld or airborne thermal cameras as well as thermal cameras compatible with smartphones i e flir one and thermal seeker this study has highlighted the use of thermal imaging in crop water stress detection to amplify the use of cwsi throughout the growing season both partial and full canopy closure growth stages however there is reported tc variability picked from thermal images due to differences in spatial distribution of soil moisture content luan et al 2021 as well as shading of the lower parts of the canopy this can be solved with cumulative probability statistics by creating different percentile range of collected tc luan et al 2021 luan et al 2021 reported that the most accurate cwsi to water stress indicators i e stomatal conductance transpiration rate net photosynthetic rate was achieved using above 50 tc quantile range even though thermal imaging has proven to diagnose stress with cwsi en and cwsi ea it has some challenges since it provides one point in time tc measurements rather than continuous like irts in that regard it can be argued that it is possible to have continuous data with thermal cameras if one employs timelapse cameras with a robust automatic tc extraction model however potential challenges will be performing the radiometric and geometric corrections and setting up the measurement platforms lebourgeois et al 2010 proposed future research involves developing irrigation scheduling thresholds for each approach across climatic zones this can be done by either modeling erdem et al 2010 or quantifying actual stress using methods like sap flow han et al 2018a or leaf photosynthetic activity parameters luan et al 2021 yuan et al 2004 furthermore the performance of different cwsi approaches with real time data measurements such as continuous soil moisture sensor readings as well as measurements of plant stress indicators i e stomatal conductance transpiration rate and net photosynthetic rate can be valuable lastly the impact of weather on the accuracy of cwsi approaches can be explored as well as the best way to couple soil water measurements and cwsi to improve irrigation management 4 conclusion performance assessment of various cwsi methods is necessary to quantify the detection of crop water stress and how they can be subsequently used in irrigation management the objective of the study was to evaluate cwsi approaches developed based on canopy temperatures tc collected using stationary irts and thermal images in addition sensitivity evaluation of these approaches to soil water dynamics was performed under varying water stress levels in semi arid climate of west central nebraska different approaches which were considered to calculate cwsi included theoretical methods cwsi th1 cwsi th2 and use of empirically developed upper and lower baselines based on meteorological data cwsi eb1 cwsi eb2 as well as artificial cwsi ea and actual natural cwsi en canopy reference surfaces this study has shown that the approach used in developing the limits most of the time influences the accuracy and ranges of cwsi values the empirical lower baseline developed for 2020 maize growing season covering both vegetative and reproductive stages and using measured mid day tc on clear sky and sunny days had a strong linear regression between tc ta and vpd tc ta 1 37 x vpd 1 82 r2 0 81 in addition the lower baseline also had a positive intercept which is common for baselines developed in semi arid climates conversely all cwsi approaches had stronger responses thus higher sensitivity to soil water depletion above 80 at deeper soil depths of 1 8 and 2 1 m the increase in sensitivity were in the order of cwsi th2 cwsi eb2 cwsi th1 cwsi eb1 cwsi en at 2 1 m and cwsi th2 cwsi eb1 cwsi eb2 cwsi th1 cwsi en at 1 8 m soil depth cwsi th2 had the highest sensitivity to d r i with the highest slope of 0 05 at 2 1 m in addition cwsi th1 had a stronger positive correlation yielding r2 0 8 p 0 05 at 2 1 m followed by cwsi eb2 r2 0 79 p 0 05 at 2 1 m cwsi th1 r2 0 78 p 0 05 and cwsi eb1 r2 0 76 p 0 05 both at 1 8 m the findings showed that cwsi varies according to the approach or method used and day to day variations might not reflect changes in soil water content thus each method requires a different threshold i e scheduling trigger value since there is considerable variability across approaches proposed future research include assessment of cwsi approaches to other crop water stress indicators i e stomatal conductance transpiration rate and net photosynthetic rate in addition to continuously monitored soil moisture depletion to establish thresholds exploring the use of stationary timelapse thermal cameras and automated tc extraction software to provide daily tc to employ the index in irrigation management evaluate weather impacts on cwsi accuracy and its sensitivity to soil water depletion and how it impacts the non water stress baseline lastly and as suggested by zhang et al 2021 develop a combined index using both soil water deficit and cwsi to account for both soil and plant feedbacks to improve irrigation water management declaration of competing interest the authors

9552,there is a growing interest of using canopy temperature tc based methods including crop water stress index cwsi for irrigation management however different approaches exist to normalize tc to microclimatic conditions which can influence the accuracy and suitability of cwsi for irrigation scheduling this study evaluated the performance of cwsi computation approaches and their sensitivity to changes in soil water depletion under different water stress levels there were six different approaches two empirical methods using developed lower baseline i e cwsi eb1 cwsi eb2 two empirical methods using either artificial cwsi ea or actual natural cwsi en canopy reference surfaces and two theoretical approaches which differ by how aerodynamic and canopy resistances are determined cwsi th1 cwsi th2 stationary infrared thermometers irts provided continuous tc to calculate cwsi eb cwsi th and cwsi en whereas mobile irts and a thermal camera provided one point in time tc and temperatures of artificial canopy reference surfaces to calculate cwsi ea these measurements were all collected from full and deficit irrigated and rainfed maize plots in west central nebraska day to day variations within and across cwsi approaches were evident and their sensitivity to soil water depletion varied greater sensitivity and correlation strength to depletion d r i were observed with cwsi th and cwsi eb under severe stress i e d r i 80 at deeper soil depths of 1 8 and 2 1 m producing r2 which ranged from 0 61 to 0 80 slope 0 03 0 05 and 0 69 0 79 slope 0 03 0 04 respectively observed differences in stress magnitudes among approaches and treatments warrants a specific irrigation triggering threshold for each approach additionally developing a robust index coupling both cwsi and soil water depletion is desirable to improve irrigation water management by accounting for both soil and plant water status keywords canopy temperature irrigation scheduling infrared thermometers mobile sensing platform canopy reference surfaces soil water depletion west central nebraska 1 introduction shortages in water resources and high irrigation costs have prompted the use of water saving strategies as a way of improving water use efficiency and crop production luan et al 2021 han et al 2018a o shaughnessy et al 2017 efforts to use reclaimed blackwater in irrigation in addition to use of desalinated seawater in industries to have enough freshwater volumes for agricultural production might be impractical since high energy requirements and costs are involved with even poor water quality panagopoulos et al 2021 2020 nonetheless to improve agricultural water use real time detection of crop water status to optimize production per unit of applied water is needed han et al 2018b wang et al 2005 thus infrared thermometry can help in precise management of irrigation water since it enables continuous monitoring of crop water status with ability to integrate both soil water status and climatic conditions in addition it is less laborious and can be performed at larger spatial or temporal scales when compared to other techniques such as soil moisture sensors dejonge et al 2015 infrared thermometers irts measure canopy temperature tc which has received considerable attention in detecting and diagnosing crop water stress gonzalez dugo et al 2020 dejonge et al 2015 since it is non destructive and continuous and scalable from plant to field o shaughnessy et al 2017 2015 dejonge et al 2015 therefore tc has for a long time been used to monitor crop water stress either directly gardner et al 1981 or as an input to compute different stress indices dejonge et al 2015 idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 as well as to quantify crop evapotranspiration kullberg et al 2017 among the indices derived from tc the most common is the crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 1988 which has been found to be responsive to irrigation amounts around mid day hours taghvaeian et al 2014b in general cwsi is computed using eq 1 1 cwsi t c t a t cl t a t cu t a t cl t a where tc c is measured canopy temperature ta c is air temperature tcl c is canopy temperature of well transpiring or non stressed crop i e minimum tc and tcu c is the canopy temperature of a non transpiring or severely stressed crop i e maximum tc terms tcu ta and tcl ta are referred to as upper and lower limits or boundaries respectively different approaches have been established to compute cwsi however the choice of which approach to use depends on numerous factors including instrumentation and maintenance costs accuracy computational expense and or flexibility in collection of used temperatures the difference among the approaches is based upon how the upper and lower limits are determined essentially the upper limit is tended to represent the conditions of a water stressed crop whose canopy is no longer transpiring in contrast the lower limit expresses the conditions of a full transpiring and non stressed canopy these limits help to normalize tc to microclimatic conditions and can largely influence the accuracy of tc for stress detection maes et al 2016 furthermore these limits are often reported as being site specific but should be universal to simplify their use in deriving cwsi for irrigation scheduling taghvaeian et al 2014a most of the approaches used and proposed include an empirical approach idso et al 1981 a theoretical approach jackson et al 1981 1988 and use of canopy reference surfaces artificial or actual jones et al 2018 maes et al 2016 dejonge et al 2015 according to idso s empirical approach the lower baseline is developed as a linear regression relationship between differential temperature i e difference between non water stressed canopy and air temperatures tc ta and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd idso et al 1981 similarly the upper limit often referred to as water stressed baseline is estimated as a linear function of vapor pressure gradient han et al 2018a 2018b or as the observed maximum tc ta of a known highly stressed canopy some of the advantages with this approach is that it depends only on two variables in addition to the measured tc however the disadvantage with this method is that it depends on experimental data to establish a lower baseline and its accuracy is easily impacted by fluctuations in weather conditions this raises questions of its potential use in real time irrigation scheduling as well as transferability of the lower baseline to different climatic conditions payero and irmak 2006 wang et al 2005 additionally it also fails to account for net radiation and wind speed like the theoretical approach wang et al 2005 and it varies depending on crop type growth stage and climatic conditions because of its unstable lower baseline king et al 2021 dejonge et al 2015 taghvaeian et al 2014b to circumvent such challenges new ideas of using either artificial or natural canopy reference surfaces have been recommended jones et al 2018 maes et al 2016 dejonge et al 2015 for this approach temperatures of either actual canopy surface stressed vs non stressed or artificial canopy surfaces dry vs wet surfaces can be used to establish the limits ideally artificial surfaces are assumed to mimic the conditions of a non transpiring canopy by using a dry green fabric as well as a non stressed canopy by using a wet and fully soaked green fabric apolo apolo et al 2020 some of the common fabric materials used as artificial surfaces include polyester meron et al 2010 and cotton maes et al 2016 however the practicality of creating reference targets assumed to have same evaporative properties of crop leaves for irrigation scheduling or use in automated stress detection at a larger scale remains unproven maes et al 2016 on the other hand jackson et al 1981 also suggested use of energy balance equation relationships to model cwsi boundaries crop water stress index has been reported to be closely related to other stress indicators including leaf water potential king et al 2020 gonzalez dugo et al 2020 stem water potential romero trigueros et al 2019 osroosh et al 2016 soil water content or depletion dejonge et al 2015 kullberg et al 2017 and stomatal conductance lena et al 2020 gonzalez dugo et al 2019 as a result this has facilitated the use of cwsi in scheduling irrigation costa filho et al 2020 stockle and dugas 1992 for various crops such as sugar beet and grapes king et al 2020 sugarcane lebourgeois et al 2010 sorghum o shaughnessy et al 2012 wheat gontia and tiwari 2008 alderfasi and nielsen 2001 broccoli erdem et al 2010 and maize irmak et al 2000 payero and irmak 2006 to further promote the use of cwsi in automated water stress detection and irrigation systems it is beneficial to assess the performance of different approaches and their ability in reporting crop water stress as compared to soil water depletion understanding each approaches sensitivity to changes in soil water content and climatic conditions will help in determining the best cwsi approach for irrigation management this study aimed at having a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of both empirical and theoretical methods and their sensitivity to changes in soil water content between irrigated and non irrigated maize specific objectives included 1 computing cwsi from theoretical and empirical methods using stationary irts as well as thermal images and mobile irts 2 evaluating the performance of theoretical and empirical methods in comparison with soil water depletion and available soil water content under varying stress levels and 3 examining responses of cwsi to daily changes in soil water content with commonly used approaches i e cwsi th1 cwsi eb1 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design field data was collected in 2020 at the university of nebraska lincoln west central research extension and education center wcreec in north platte nebraska usa this region has a semi arid climate with 80 of annual precipitation occurring between late april and mid october payero et al 2009 the predominant soil at wcreec is cozad silt loam with field capacity of 0 29 m3 m 3 and permanent wilting point of 0 11 m3 m 3 klocke et al 1999 the experiment field uses a subsurface drip irrigation system with drip lines spaced at 1 52 m every other crop row and installed at 0 4 m depth treatments including full irrigation deficit irrigation and rainfed were considered and organized in four blocks in a randomized complete block design rcbd with individual plot dimensions of 9 1 by 72 2 m however this study used only the three northern blocks due to limited sensor availability maize zea mays l hybrid pioneer 1197 amt corteva agriscience willington delaware usa was planted on april 29 at a population of 84 000 seeds ha 1 and row spacing of 0 76 m nitrogen fertilizer in the form of urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 0 0 was applied uniformly at pre plant on april 12 at a rate of 67 kg ha 1 using a double coulter applicator at a depth of 0 03 m and at 0 19 m from the center of the crop row on both sides in addition 126 kg ha 1 of in season n was applied at five leaf stage on june 12 at the soil surface close to the crop row using a 360 y drop system 360 yield center morton illinois usa seasonal irrigation was applied based on the full irrigation treatment applied up to twice a week when soil water depletion measured by neutron moisture meter nmm exceeded 50 of the maximum allowable depletion mad 2 2 data collection daily canopy temperature tc was continuously measured using stationary apogee si 1h1 irts apogee instruments logan utah usa the irts were installed on june 17 corresponding to approximately 70 of canopy cover in three replications of each treatment the irts were positioned at zenith angle of 45 towards the canopy in northeast direction and were adjusted weekly to maintain a height of 1 m above canopy temperatures were measured every 6 s averaged to 1 min and logged onto cr1000x dataloggers campbell scientific logan utah usa all stationary irts were calibrated by the manufacturer prior to field installation instantaneous tc was collected using four apogee si 1h1 irts and a flir duo pro r thermal camera flir wilsonville oregon us mounted on a mobile sensing platform fig 1 the sensing platform was driven parallel to the plant rows at a speed of 1 02 m s 1 and two interior rows were sensed the thermal camera with a global positioning system gps was installed 2 m above the canopy which was the height where both canopy and reference surfaces could be observed pointed at nadir view whereas each pair of the irts were positioned 1 m above the canopy pointing 45 towards maize rows and logged tc after every 0 5 s on cr1000x datalogger all irts were calibrated by the manufacturer prior to their use on the platform the sensing platform also carried artificial canopy reference surfaces and an external differential gps dgps receiver holland scientific lincoln nebraska usa which was used for geo locating and processing of collected data two thermal images were taken in the middle of each plot with dry and wet artificial canopy reference surfaces in the field of view fabricated using green florist styrofoam bricks continuous temperatures of the reference surfaces were measured by two thermocouples and logged by omega hh306a datalogging thermometer omega engineering norwalk ct us prior to sensing the wet surface temperature was allowed to equilibrate i e constant temperature observed on omega hh306a datalogger for 30 min there were five field sensing campaign days july 3 v8 july 13 v10 july 31 vt aug 7 r2 and aug 21 r4 5 comparing measured tc by irts and those provided by thermal images was important during the quality data assurance of temperatures extracted from thermal images soil volumetric water content θv was measured at depths of 15 300 cm at increments of 30 cm using cpn 503 elite hydroprobe and cpn 503dr neutron moisture meters nmms instrotek concord california usa a local gravimetric calibration was conducted producing coefficient of determination r2 of 0 977 and root mean square error rmse of 0 010 m3 m 3 in order to convert the count ratios to θv lo et al 2020 to capture soil water dynamics two aluminum access tubes were installed on either side of the crop row at distance of 0 19 m in each plot or treatment replication one tube was 0 15 m and the other 0 57 m from the drip tape to capture water distribution in both dry and wet rows the average readings between the two tubes were used in the subsequent analyses daily meteorological data 1 min resolution was obtained from the onsite nebraska climate office weather station under nebraska mesonet https mesonet unl edu located 100 m from the experimentation site collected data included air temperature ta c relative humidity rh solar radiation rs w m 2 wind speed u2 m s 1 and precipitation p mm vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated using ta and rh allen et al 1998 all variables were measured at 2 m height except windspeed which was measured at 3 m but adjusted to 2 m following technique described by allen et al 1998 2 3 crop water stress index calculations as shown in fig 2 different approaches can be used to compute crop water stress index eq 2a with measured canopy temperatures of both stressed and non stressed canopy and or for the targeted treatment as well as temperatures of artificial canopy surfaces mimicking the transpiration potential of the actual canopy under study the methods are different based upon how the upper and lower limits are determined according to jackson et al 1988 the limits create boundaries within which the measured canopy temperatures can be normalized 2 3 1 empirical approach using meteorological data cwsi eb1 cwsi eb2 the empirical approach was introduced by idso et al 1981 and it has been commonly used for computing cwsi eq 2a han et al 2018b dejonge et al 2015 irmak et al 2000 therefore this was referred to as cwsi eb whereby eb implies empirical establishment of lower baseline as shown in fig 2 empirical lower baseline a k a non stressed baseline tc ta l is determined as a linear regression between differential temperature tc ta and vpd as shown in eq 2b where tc is collected from a non stressed fully watered crop with regards to the upper baseline tc ta u eq 2c it can be determined following two methods 1 using tc collected from a stressed crop e g rainfed treatment over a wide range of vpd and maximum observed tc ta is considered as the upper limit eq 2 dejonge et al 2015 and 2 using eq 2d which is different from eq 2c since it uses vpg instead of vpd han et al 2018a yuan et al 2004 first method using the upper limit with eq 2c was referred to as cwsi eb1 and second using eq 2d was termed as cwsi eb2 2a cwsi t c t a a t c t a l t c t a u t c t a l 2b t c t a l a b vpd 2c t c t a u max t c t a 2d t c t a u a b vpg where a is the intercept and b is the slope of the linear regression of tc ta l against vpd vpd kpa is the vapor pressure deficit assuming leaf temperature is equal to air temperature and vpg kpa is the difference between the saturation vapor pressure evaluated at air temperature ta and at a higher air temperature equal to air temperature plus a i e ta a 2 3 2 theoretical approach cwsi th1 and cwsi th2 the upper and upper limits following the theoretical approach of jackson et al 1981 and jackson et al 1988 were computed using eq 3a and eq 3b respectively as presented in fig 2 this approach was referred to as cwsi th in this paper calculated using the limits and eq 2a under section 2 3 1 the upper limit of tc ta is calculated when rc is allowed to increase to infinity or without bound thus getting to eq 3a the lower limit of tc ta is established by assuming that the canopy resistance is equal to achieved canopy resistance at potential transpiration of well watered canopy surface rc rcp thus getting to eq 3b however there are two ways of calculating theoretical cwsi which are based upon the different procedures of computing both aerodynamic and canopy resistances han et al 2018a first method cwsi th1 is computed by considering eq 3c to compute aerodynamic resistance jackson et al 1988 and assuming potential canopy resistance to be equal to zero i e rcp 0 whereby canopy transpiration is assumed to be equal to evaporation of a free water surface jackson et al 1981 1988 second method cwsi th2 uses seasonal averages of ra r a eq 3d and rcp r cp eq 3e as suggested by o toole and real 1986 cwsi th2 has been used and convincingly performed well as indicated by han et al 2018a and clawson et al 1989

canopy reference surfaces cwsi en cwsi ea to improvise simple methods of determining limits due to challenges of developing idso s empirical and inaccuracies from estimated limits with jackson s theoretical method tc of both well irrigated and a stressed crop as well as temperatures of dry and wet artificial canopy reference surfaces can be used apolo apolo et al 2020 maes et al 2016 meron et al 2010 while using the actual canopy surface upper and lower limits are obtained as differential temperature using tc from a non water stressed canopy at potential transpiration tcl and a water stressed canopy without transpiration tcu respectively eqs 4a 4b this approach is similar to how other stress indices are derived such as degrees above non stress canopy dans dejonge et al 2015 or temperature stress day tsd gardner et al 1981 on the other hand artificial canopy surfaces can be used by using temperatures of wet soaked fabric twet and a dry fabric tdry made from green styrofoam fig 1 upper and lower limits are calculated as differences between ta and temperatures of wet and dry styrofoam surfaces respectively eqs 4c and 4d however the cwsi can be simplified as presented in eq 4e after substituting eqs 4a 4d in eq 2a under section 2 3 1 cwsi calculated with actual canopy temperatures and artificial canopy reference temperatures were referred to as cwsi en and cwsi ea respectively 4a t c t a l t cl t a 4b t c t a u t cu t a 4c t c t a l t wet t a 4d t c t a u t dry t a 4e cwsi t c t cl t cu t cl or cwsi t c t wet t dry t wet where tcu c is the temperature of stressed canopy upper limit tcl is temperature of non stressed canopy lower limit twet c and tdry c is the temperature of wet and dry artificial canopy reference surfaces respectively 2 4 data preparation and water stress calculations 2 4 1 thermal images provide artificial canopy surface temperatures desktop software known as flir tools flir systems wilsonville or version 5 13 was used to extract both tc and temperatures of artificial canopy reference surfaces from the thermal images within the flir tool software working environment adjustments were made to reflect the normal environmental conditions by adjusting rh to what was measured by the onsite weather station and emissivity for both reference and canopy surfaces was set to 0 98 maes et al 2016 agam et al 2013 to determine accurate temperatures of the surfaces a total of 160 temperature points were selected from the actual sunlit canopy surfaces within a thermal image and 80 temperature points for each of the artificial canopy reference surfaces wet and dry surfaces data for all selected points were automatically exported from the flir tools working environment and then averaged for each surface and plot using microsoft excel microsoft ca usa for quality assurance of temperatures extracted from thermal images tc from both thermal images and mobile irts were compared to observe how close the values are to each other similarly temperatures of artificial canopy reference surfaces extracted from thermal images were compared to what was measured by thermocouples spatial filtering and averaging of tc collected by the four mobile irts within a clipped length of 10 7 m in the middle of each plot was done using microsoft excel s visual basic microsoft ca usa and open source geoprocessing software qgis desktop 3 12 3 qgis developers gruet switzerland median tc values from each of the four apogee irts were calculated and then averaged to a single tc first by plot and finally by treatment hence single tc value for each treatment was used to compute cwsi ea for each treatment on any field sensing campaign day 2 4 2 water stress calculations field collected continuous 1 min tc from stationary irts and weather variables were averaged over 15 min timestep however 15 min tc was done by plot and after averaged by treatment thus mean 15 min tc for each treatment was used in the subsequent daily cwsi calculations furthermore used tc was collected at mid day for selected hot days with clear sky for 4 hr period from solar noon i e 1200 1600 h central daytime eventually calculated 15 min cwsi was averaged over hourly and then to daily cwsi conversely for instantaneous cwsi as for cwsi ea average temperatures tc twet and tdry collected from mobile sensing platform using mobile irts and thermal camera across treatment plots were averaged by treatment on any field sensing campaign day among the used cwsi methods included those which provided daily cwsi values as well as one which provided instantaneous cwsi values typically on any field sensing campaign day therefore as illustrated in fig 2 under section 2 3 daily cwsi was computed using three methods empirical with developed lower baseline i e cwsi eb1 and cwsi eb2 using eqs 2a 2d section 2 3 1 theoretical i e cwsi th1 and cwsi th2 using eqs 3b 3e section 2 3 2 and empirical actual canopy reference surfaces i e cwsi en using eqs 4a 4b and 4e section 2 3 3 whereas instantaneous cwsi was computed still using empirical approach but with artificial canopy reference surfaces i e cwsi ea using eqs 4c 4e section 2 3 3 however comparison between all methods was conducted into two separate ways one by comparing only cwsi approaches which provided daily estimates i e only three approaches and second way involved matching values from these three approaches to those of instantaneous cwsi approach on similar dates of field sensing campaigns with purpose to accommodate cwsi ea on the other hand it is worth noting that lower baseline for cwsi eb was developed empirically as explained in section 2 3 1 but considering tc of fully irrigated treatment on days following either irrigation or precipitation events since wetting events allow for non water limiting conditions with regards to cwsi en the lower limit tcl was determined using the minimum achieved tc of fully irrigated treatments around solar noon period on days following irrigation or precipitation events in contrast upper limit tcu was achieved as maximum tc across rainfed treatments with matched days as of tcl additionally the limits for cwsi ea were determined by artificial canopy reference surfaces where tcl and tcu were equal to temperatures of wet and dry surfaces respectively 2 5 soil water depletion and available soil water content to compare cwsi to soil water dynamics each method was matched to estimated soil water depletion or soil water content on that same day according to allen et al 1998 daily root zone soil water depletion can be computed based on a soil water balance swb equation as presented in eq 6a using previous depletion dr i evapotranspiration et irrigation applied i and precipitation p because of limited amount of rainfall received in the two months of july and august runoff r and deep percolation dp were assumed to be non existent and thus equal to zero and the upward flux u was also assumed negligible daily crop evapotranspiration i e etc was also computed following fao56 single crop coefficient method daily etc daily kc daily etr allen et al 1998 where daily kc was computed from the developed kc curve for each treatment using the following steps first weekly etc was computed using weekly swb eq 6b from nmm measurements second daily alfalfa reference et etr was calculated using local weather station data and modified penman monteith equation asce 2005 and then summed over a week to align with weekly swb etc after which kc values on each nmm date i e weekly kc was computed as a ratio of weekly swb etc and weekly etr and then interpolated to seasonal kc values by fitting a fourth order polynomial function with cumulative growing degree days cgdds colaizzi et al 2017 rudnick and irmak 2014 furthermore modeled profile depletion eq 6a was corrected with actual depletion on days with nmm measurements which was computed using eq 6c 6a d r i 1 d r i et i r i dp i u i p i i i 6b et c p i u r dp s 6c d r i z x θ fc θ obs where d r i 1 is the root zone soil water deficit of the current day i 1 based on previous day i etc mm is crop evapotranspiration s mm is change in soil water storage and it was measured using nmms θ obs is observed or measured volumetric water content with nmm m3 m 3 θ fc is the field capacity m3 m 3 and zx 300 mm is the thickness of the soil layer x 2 6 analyzing soil water dynamics with cwsi approaches to examine the sensitivity of the cwsi approaches to soil water dynamics a linear plateau model fig 3 was established on scatter plot data of cwsi versus percentage soil water depletion d r i computed using eq 7 payero and irmak 2006 three hypothetical stress levels were considered no stress i e dr i 50 moderate stress i e 50 d r i 80 and high stress i e d r i 80 as illustrated in the fig 3 the sensitivity response of cwsi to d r i was assessed depending on the coefficient of determination r2 and slope at a significance level of 0 05 therefore any approach with low r2 and low slope was regarded to have low sensitivity while high r2 and high slope indicated strong sensitivity to d r i on the other hand daily cwsi specifically cwsi th1 cwsi eb1 and cwsi en were evaluated to daily changes in available soil water content after depletion due to crop et or addition of irrigation or precipitation cwsi th1 and cwsi eb1 were particularly selected because they are more commonly used methods in exploring potential use of cwsi in irrigation scheduling king et al 2020 han et al 2018a o shaughnessy et al 2012 7 d r i d r i taw i where dr i is the soil water depletion in the crop root zone on day i mm taw i is the maximum amount of water that can be depleted from the active root zone on day i mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation management and soil water measurements the 2020 maize growing season was a dry year with seasonal rainfall of 199 mm below the long term 1980 2020 average of 450 mm based on weather dataset of the nebraska mesonet https mesonet unl edu it was also a hot year with average ta of 4 c and 5 c above the long term average of 24 c and 23 c in the months of july and august respectively therefore increased temperature contributed to much lower rh but higher vpd all this contributing to increased crop et and seasonal irrigation requirements fig 4a as shown in table 1 august received less rainfall as compared to july these months are known for high peak crop water demand as the crop transitions into the reproductive period soil water content was greatest in fully irrigated maize plots than in deficit irrigated and rainfed maize plots fig 2b due to higher irrigation amounts fig 4a as a result lower average tc was observed on hot days around solar noon when ta 28 c in fully irrigated treatment and it was 3 c and 5 c lower than that of deficit and rainfed treatments respectively changes in soil water dynamics were well tracked with nmm and swb model in all treatments fig 4b 3 2 artificial canopy reference surfaces temperatures for establishing the limits temperatures of the artificial canopy reference surfaces were measured using both thermocouples and thermal images to have confidence in using thermal images to provide artificial canopy reference surface temperatures tc measured by both the mobile irts and thermal images were compared there was a good agreement between the tc measured from the two sources as presented in fig 5 there was a strong relationship between mobile irt and thermal image tc with r2 equal to 0 81 and root mean square error rmse of 1 21 c discrepancies between the mobile and thermal image tc values could be due to sensor type and difference in positioning i e irts were oblique at 45 whereas thermal camera was nadir at 90 also this might have been due to mobile irts taking tc measurements from patches of shaded canopy as well as existence of very cold pixels within the thermal image providing lower tc compared to average tc measured by mobile irts artificial canopy reference surface temperatures i e twet for wet surface and tdry for dry surface measured by thermocouples and thermal images were also compared based on the thermocouple measurements the average twet was 27 7 c compared to 45 4 c for tdry as presented in fig 6a and as expected the dry surface had higher temperatures 40 50 c 25th 75th percentile range than the wet surface 25 30 c 25th 75th percentile range however from the two sources of temperatures thermocouples and thermal images differences in temperatures were not only observed across sensing dates but also between measurement options thermocouples versus median and or average temperatures extracted from thermal images fig 6b c this was because thermocouples measured temperatures of both surfaces at a single point however with thermal images temperatures were manually extracted at different points along the surfaces there was high variability in extracted temperatures attributed to shading of the canopy and spatial differences in soil water content indeed spatial variability of temperatures from thermal images were also seen by luan et al 2021 who suggested the average of temperatures above the 50 percentile are useful as they provided cwsi values that correlated well with other water stress indicators for all field sensing campaign dates except july 31 the average values from the three methods were similar by 1 c and 2 c with the wet and dry artificial canopy reference surfaces respectively for the case of the thermocouples temperature variabilities can be attributed to sensing direction i e difference in incoming rs interception as well as measurement depth i e measurements for images taken on the surface whereas a few mm from the surface for thermocouples a linear relationship between temperatures of thermal images by averaging values i e average thermal and thermocouples produced a weak relationship for both wet artificial surface r2 0 15 with rmse of 2 2 c and dry artificial surface r2 0 28 with rmse of 6 2 c data not shown temperatures from the wet surface twet and dry surface tdry were used to determine the lower limit and upper limit respectively fig 7 the tdry was considerably higher than the stressed rainfed canopy temperature as shown in fig 7 with mean difference of about 15 6 c in all sensing campaign days the large difference between the natural and artificial surface suggests that either or a combination of the dry artificial canopy surface failed to capture the actual temperature of the stressed canopy or the natural surface was not near non transpiring conditions whereas the wet surface was better in capturing the temperature of the non stressed canopy since both temperatures seemed to have been close with a mean difference of about 1 4 c across the field campaign days therefore such temperature differences highly contribute to observable differences within the calculated cwsi likewise tdry differences between different approaches were observed by wang et al 2005 when theoretical stressed tc estimated by jackson theoretical method jackson et al 1988 was compared to imitated stressed canopy created by coating thin glue on the actual leaf to close the stomata additionally other studies have also used tdry by assuming it to be higher than air temperature by 5 c i e tdry ta 5 c in absence of a dry surface ben gal et al 2009 irmak et al 2000 according to maes et al 2016 wet artificial reference surface light green 100 cotton fabric and 0 5 mm thickness can be used instead of using a manually wetted leaf surfaces if it is continuously wetted and from their analysis there was temperature difference of about 0 8 0 4 c between the wet artificial surface and wetted leaf surfaces nonetheless careful determination of these temperatures is necessary since from a simple sensitivity analysis of tdry and twet on cwsi it showed that if twet is estimated to be higher than tc the crop is assumed to be non stressed i e low cwsi values even when there is large soil water depletion similarly when tdry is estimated to be close to or less than tc the crop is assumed to be stressed i e high cwsi values even under adequate soil water content durigon and de jong van lier 2013 3 3 canopy and differential temperatures in irrigated and non irrigated maize daily continuous canopy temperatures tc measured by stationary irts on clear and sunny days at mid day period 1200 1600 h were used to compute differential temperature between tc and ta thereafter cumulative frequency curves were developed fig 8a b therefore maize crop response to irrigation was reflected in both tc fig 8a and differential temperature tc ta fig 8b and variability was distinct between the irrigated full deficit and non irrigated rainfed treatments for both tc and tc ta cumulative frequency curves all exhibited similar trends however the rainfed curve shifted more towards the right as compared to the curves for irrigated maize canopy which were quite similar to each other due to small difference in their measured tc according to dejonge et al 2015 tc for corn can be categorized into three levels as tcmean 27 c 27 c tcmean 29 c and tcmean 29 c representing non stressed marginally stressed and highly stressed canopy respectively illustrated in fig 8a and they are based on tcritical of 28 c which was suggested as a threshold for maize stress peters and evett 2004 2008 therefore these ranges were identified clearly around 30 of the tc across the treatments fig 8a it was also noted that in general on days when average mid day ta was above 30 c rainfed tc was above tcritical when a crop was undergoing some stress conversely the median range of tc at 50 was 28 8 c for full irrigation treatment followed by deficit at 29 c and finally 30 3 c for rainfed maximum tc in rainfed was higher by 6 3 c and 3 9 c in comparison to full and deficit irrigated treatments respectively similarly the median values of tc ta at 50 ranged from 2 1 c for full irrigation treatment to 1 8 c for deficit and 0 2 c for rainfed based on the minimum tc ta at 0 15 and maximum tc ta at 100 across treatments tc ta ranged from 5 8 4 6 c 5 7 4 9 c and 5 5 8 6 c in fully irrigated deficit irrigated and rainfed maize respectively however maximum calculated value of tc ta in rainfed exceeded 8 c which was high as compared to the irrigated treatments with their maximum values less than 5 c the high tc ta values observed from rainfed treatment helps support the use of rainfed tc to find a suitable upper limit king et al 2021 this particular season had above normal temperatures as well as below normal rainfall however caution should be exercised when applying this approach for cool and wet years according to gonzalez dugo et al 2014 on a hot day where average ta 30 c tc ta can increase early in the day even before solar noon if the stress levels are high and it can also easily fluctuate with instant changes in evaporative demand and solar radiation in the afternoons nevertheless deficit and full irrigated maize canopy had a low tc ta due to water sufficiency however rainfed maize canopy had exceptionally high tc ta because water was limiting greater tc ta in rainfed maize can be attributed to water stress and reduced transpiration rates from partial stomatal closure gonzalez dugo et al 2014 baker et al 2013 usually tc ta 0 indicates a cooler canopy with less stress which is a good condition for developing a lower baseline whereas tc ta 0 indicates a stressed canopy with higher tc in relation to ta gonzalez dugo et al 2014 observations between tc ta and cwsi with baselines made by kirnak et al 2019 indicated that when tc ta was negative then cwsi 1 and when tc ta was positive then cwsi 1 3 4 empirical baselines using meteorological data and daily continuous tc a non stressed baseline was developed from fully irrigated maize using the daily mid day tc for hot and clear days following irrigation events the developed baseline showed a strong linear relationship between tc ta and vpd tc ta 1 37 x vpd 1 82 r2 0 81 as presented in fig 9 however the strength of this regression can be influenced by the weather fluctuations and variability stockle and dugas 1992 and fluctuation in tc gonzalez dugo et al 2014 as well as the et potential between non stressed and stressed crop gontia and tiwari 2008 additionally the baseline had a negative slope and a positive intercept which is common for most of the developed baselines in semi arid climates gonzalez dugo et al 2020 the upper baseline for cwsi eb1 was 5 c whereas the upper baseline for cwsi eb2 ranged from 3 3 to 8 4 c over a wide range of vpd of 0 9 4 7 kpa while using cwsi eb approach the cwsi 1 can occur especially when there are fluctuations in atmospheric demand and soil moisture conditions which cause the actual tc ta to be greater than the upper baseline dejonge et al 2015 the limitation with this method is that it is very sensitive to weather and easily surpasses the expected range of cwsi i e 0 cwsi 1 which makes the interpretation of values sometimes challenging however negative values are interpreted as crop being non stressed and values greater than 1 indicate that the crop is severely stressed dejonge et al 2015 one of the advantages of this approach is that it can provide continuous and daily estimates of the stress levels which makes water stress diagnosis much easier 3 5 comparing cwsi approaches calculated daily cwsi on identified clear and sunny days varied for all approaches under different water sufficiency levels during the 2020 growing season with low values in irrigated treatments and high values in rainfed treatment fig 10 such differences are depicting the influence of frequent irrigation events to manage water stress in irrigated treatments all cwsis exhibited the same pattern with slightly lower values in full than in deficit treatment and higher values between irrigated and rainfed treatment however there was minimal differences in cwsi eb approaches cwsi eb1 cwsi eb2 regardless of the treatment in addition cwsi th had higher values as compared to other approaches across treatments particularly cwsi th2 which registered the highest values especially in rainfed treatment with theoretical approach cwsi th1 ranged between 0 1 and 1 5 and cwsi th2 between 0 7 and 1 6 whereas with empirical approach using developed lower baselines ranged from 0 4 to 1 0 and 0 9 to 1 1 for cwsi eb1 and cwsi eb2 respectively lastly the cwsi en which was calculated using actual temperatures of the stressed i e rainfed and non stressed i e fully irrigated canopies to establish the limits the values ranged from 0 1 to 1 0 it is described in fig 10 that cwsi increases with increase in stress from full to deficit and then rainfed settings it is worth noting that there was a narrower seasonal range with cwsi eb methods and cwsi en as compared to cwsi th under irrigated treatments indicating that cwsi th can be used under mildly stressed conditions observed differences in stress magnitudes shown by all approaches under same treatments i e cwsi th overestimated stress when compared to cwsi eb and cwsi en suggest developing a specific stress triggering threshold for each approach as presented in fig 10 cwsi th s i e cwsi th1 and cwsi th2 exceeded 1 and cwsi eb s i e cwsi eb1 and cwsi eb2 had negative values which is contrary to what was recommended by researchers who introduced cwsi and reported a range of 0 1 idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 1988 it is not surprising that some of the cwsi eb values were negative and this has also been observed in other studies that have used empirical baselines to calculate cwsi dejonge et al 2015 cwsi th tended to overestimate stress with high values as similarly observed by han et al 2018a and agam et al 2013 however this can be due to a cooler lower baseline fig 7 or uncertainties around the computation of aerodynamic resistance han et al 2018a whereas cwsi eb underestimated stress with low and negative values dejonge et al 2015 typically at mid day time when 0 1 cwsi 0 5 the crop is assumed to be stressed cwsi 0 5 moderately stressed and severely stressed when cwsi 1 0 dejonge et al 2015 however because of magnitude differences of cwsi values reported across approaches these stress ranges might change or vary depending on which approach is being used in cotton crop cwsi eb was found to vary so much and cwsi th was stable when the water stress was absent stockle and dugas 1992 also ben gal et al 2009 recommended theoretical method since it does not require a wet or dry reference surface in order to compare cwsi ea calculated for only the sensing campaign dates with other approaches a box plot fig 11 was developed by selecting the cwsi values for other approaches which matched the same field sensing campaign dates as cwsi ea this allowed to compare all theoretical to all empirical methods such that all common methods used in cwsi computations are presented there was a smaller range of cwsi values among empirical baselines and empirical natural surfaces than as seen with cwsi th however distributions were wider with cwsi th1 and cwsi en as compared with cwsi th2 with regards to cwsi eb and cwsi ea minimal differences were seen especially in irrigated treatments however there was a slightly larger difference among these two approaches in the rainfed treatment in rainfed treatment the mean values of cwsi th1 and cwsi eb s were close to the maxima since extremely large tc measurements become more prevalent as stress increases fig 8 the varying cwsi values from low in irrigated treatments to then high in rainfed treatment shows the relevance of water sufficiency in controlling stress in maize overall the values of cwsi th1 commonly used and cwsi en were higher in comparison to other approaches as also observed by han et al 2018b cwsi th1 approach provided higher ranges of cwsi hence failing to report non stressed periods in addition it tended to overestimate crop water stress correct estimation of aerodynamic resistance remains a challenge and directly impacts the limits used to determine water stress also the assumption of the canopy resistance to be equal to zero i e rcp 0 when determining the lower limit for cwsi th2 might not apply under certain weather conditions and this can cause a huge shift in cwsi values therefore cwsi th1 might require a higher threshold approx 0 3 0 6 to identify stress for irrigation scheduling 3 6 sensitivity of cwsi approaches to soil water depletion under varying stress levels this section focused on the sensitivity of the cwsi to percentage soil water depletion i e d r i under different water stress levels and different soil depths this was based on developing linear relationships at two shallow depths of 0 6 and 0 9 m and two deeper depths of 1 8 and 2 1 m fig 12 table 2 the level of sensitivity of cwsi to d r i was analyzed based on the slope of the regressions as well as understanding the strength of the correlation at 0 05 level of significance as summarized in table 2 the slope represented the increase in stress indicated by cwsi when there was an increase in soil water depletion by 1 as presented in fig 12 at deeper depths regardless of the approach used cwsi was observed to be sensitive to depletion above 80 and the strength of the correlation was much greater under high stress from table 2 cwsi th2 had the highest sensitivity to d r i since it had the highest slope of 0 05 at 2 1 m soil depth in addition the increase in sensitivity was in the order of cwsi th2 cwsi eb2 cwsi th1 cwsi eb1 cwsi en at 2 1 m and cwsi th2 cwsi eb1 cwsi eb2 cwsi th1 cwsi en at 1 8 m soil depth on the other hand the strength of the relationships varied even when approaches had similar or close slopes approaches which were most sensitive also exhibited stronger correlations at 2 1 m more so cwsi th and cwsi eb which had significant p value 0 05 and positive correlation ranging from r2 of 0 59 0 80 greater strength was indicated in cwsi eb1 r2 0 74 cwsi eb2 r2 0 79 and cwsi th1 which had a higher r2 of 0 80 whereas lower strength was shown by cwsi th2 and cwsi en with significant r2 equal to 0 61 and 0 59 respectively table 2 in contrast it was interesting to observe that at shallow depths cwsi approaches failed to show expected trends under moderate and high stress levels especially at 0 6 m with all methods exhibiting weaker relationships r2 0 5 as well as sensitivity to d r i probably because the rooting zone was situated at deeper depths and there were no signals in canopy temperatures due to changes in soil moisture in the topsoil as also observed by dejonge et al 2015 it is common to see weak correlations r2 0 5 between empirical baselines when a linear relationship is developed between cwsi and soil water depletion mm after using peak tc at 1500 hr in greeley colorado from the results it can be argued that for cwsi to be reliably used for detecting stress or even deciding the right timing of irrigation the crop must be under serious stress when d r i 80 thus it might fail to identify stress under moderate stress i e 50 d r i 80 however under no stress conditions fig 12 high cwsi values for cwsi th1 cwsi th2 and cwsi en were observed and strongly correlated to d r i at deeper soil depths consequently this might be confused with actual stress but rather it is due to outliers influenced by weather fluctuations i e stress is induced under extremely hot day even when there is adequate soil moisture thus such observations might be contributed by other factors mainly variabilities within weather conditions but not changes in soil water dynamics for example the crop will show signs of stress under very high ta and rs which cause stomates to close and eventually curling of leaves even when there is adequate soil water zhang et al 2021 hence cwsi th and cwsi eb can perform satisfactorily under severe stress however at moderate stress cwsi ebs performed poorly which implies that such approach might fail to identify stress as indicated by soil water measurements similarly han et al 2018a reported good relationships between the cwsi eb and cwsi th with the sap flow measurements according to han et al 2018b total available water can be accurately estimated using cwsi eb1 from continuously measured tc to improve estimation of soil water depletion with soil water balance model this section has provided some proof for recommending cwsi eb and cwsi th approaches over others for monitoring water stress however confidence in cwsi relative to soil water depletion was greatest when soil water depletion exceeded 80 which is likely past most recommended irrigation scheduling management zones in addition further analysis is required to assess the impact of weather variability on cwsi sensitivity from the simple analysis done in this study data not shown weather had less influence on cwsi sensitivity as compared to soil water availability lastly utilization of a daily soil water balance model can contribute to errors when establishing stress levels thus it might be beneficial to deploy locally calibrated soil moisture sensors for constant monitoring of soil water status singh et al 2021 3 7 comparing daily changes in cwsi to available soil water content as demonstrated in the literature and in the present study cwsi tends to increase as soil water content decreases which has prompted the use of cwsi in scheduling irrigation but the questions remain 1 how sensitive is cwsi to soil water content drawdowns or water addition in the soil profile and 2 can cwsi reliably infer stress without monitoring soil moisture in the profile for most of july and august cwsi failed to respond to changes in soil water across treatments fig 13 at times cwsi would increase without soil water drawdown or after few days of irrigation and rainfall among irrigated treatments cwsi th1 and cwsi eb1 were not responsive to changes in soil water content when above 350 mm but were responsive below 350 mm especially in august when considering a rooting depth of 2 1 m as noted in red circles cwsi th1 and cwsi eb1 were able to capture changes in soil water content due to irrigation precipitation or et overall there was less response of cwsi th1 and cwsi eb1 shown by the trends of cwsi versus available soil water fig 13 in irrigated treatments as compared to rainfed treatment han et al 2018b emphasized that cwsi th can fail to respond to irrigation events and distinguish stress responses at key growth stages due to fluctuations in aerodynamic resistances the uncertainty of cwsi eb is influenced by the intercept of non water stress baselines han et al 2018b and dominant low vpd conditions stockle and dugas 1992 also cwsi eb can delay showing stress which complicates meeting the irrigation needs in real time stockle and dugas 1992 despite the fact that cwsi has been used as an irrigation scheduling tool since it supports automation of data collection with minimal efforts king et al 2020a still there are ambiguities with its response to soil water depletion or available soil water content in most instances when irrigation was added shown by spikes in soil water graph all cwsi approaches unfortunately did not drop immediately probably due to time lag of stressed crops to recover quickly jackson et al 1981 therefore jackson 1982 concluded that it is very difficult to infer available soil water content from canopy temperatures alone because of different factors involved such as recovery periods after irrigation or precipitation root growth and volume and the plant senescence especially in late reproductive stages of maize in addition cwsi is also impacted by the evaporative demand and if it exceeds the ability of the roots to mine water from the profile then cwsi possibly increase without any change in available soil water deficit as it exceeds maximum allowable depletion 3 8 discussion and future research this study has contributed to a comprehensive assessment among most suggested cwsi approaches and their sensitivity to soil water depletion over a range of water stress conditions the differences in stress magnitude of approaches across treatments warrant different irrigation triggering thresholds for each approach if they are to be implemented in irrigation scheduling likewise other studies have observed similar differences particularly with cwsi th and cwsi eb such as han et al 2018a with three approaches cwsi th1 cwsi th2 cwsi eb2 yuan et al 2004 with three approaches cwsi th1 cwsi eb1 cwsi alves model and erdem et al 2010 with cwsi eb1 however based on a study done by han et al 2018a cwsi th2 and cwsi eb2 gave reasonable estimate of water stress measured by sap flow a water stress indicator which directly measure actual transpiration of the crop but cwsi th1 overestimated water stress and failed to correctly respond to irrigation events in addition the increase in cwsi values occurred when there was an increase in water stress and this was also observed by yuan et al 2004 with cwsi th1 and cwsi eb1 which both correlated well to other water stress indicators such as leaf water potential stomatal resistance and leaf net photosynthesis larger fluctuations were seen in theoretical than in empirical approaches however it was the opposite with findings from yuan et al 2004 who suggested theoretical over empirical approach for practical use in irrigation scheduling in full irrigation management cwsi eb approaches fluctuated around cwsi 0 as also observed by erdem et al 2010 thus proving its ability to quantify stress under minimal stress levels erdem et al 2010 on the other hand preliminary analysis data not shown showed that weather fluctuations might have less influence on the sensitivity of both cwsi th1 and cwsi eb1 to soil water depletion however further in depth analysis is required to have conclusive findings about weather impacts on the sensitivity according to other studies such as king et al 2021 and han et al 2018a weather conditions might impact the accuracy of cwsi when correlated to other water stress indicators it is claimed that at windspeed 6 m s 1 the tc data might not be useful to calculate cwsi because the canopy resistance is already impacted or compromised as high wind speeds can reduce stomatal conductance and transpiration rate thus increasing tc under adequate soil water content king et al 2021 furthermore when computing cwsi eb the choice of method to determine the upper limit matters and from this study the limits were seen to have varied amongst the methods lebourgeois et al 2010 emphasized that using tc of stressed treatment as an upper limit might be a wrong approach since the crop can still be transpiring yet to have accurate cwsi it is advised to use tc of a non transpiring canopy only achieved by manually closing the stomata however a rainfed treatment can still be used since it undergoes severe stress without transpiring for the most part of the season during drought conditions lebourgeois et al 2010 different thermal camera setups can be used to collect tc including handheld or airborne thermal cameras as well as thermal cameras compatible with smartphones i e flir one and thermal seeker this study has highlighted the use of thermal imaging in crop water stress detection to amplify the use of cwsi throughout the growing season both partial and full canopy closure growth stages however there is reported tc variability picked from thermal images due to differences in spatial distribution of soil moisture content luan et al 2021 as well as shading of the lower parts of the canopy this can be solved with cumulative probability statistics by creating different percentile range of collected tc luan et al 2021 luan et al 2021 reported that the most accurate cwsi to water stress indicators i e stomatal conductance transpiration rate net photosynthetic rate was achieved using above 50 tc quantile range even though thermal imaging has proven to diagnose stress with cwsi en and cwsi ea it has some challenges since it provides one point in time tc measurements rather than continuous like irts in that regard it can be argued that it is possible to have continuous data with thermal cameras if one employs timelapse cameras with a robust automatic tc extraction model however potential challenges will be performing the radiometric and geometric corrections and setting up the measurement platforms lebourgeois et al 2010 proposed future research involves developing irrigation scheduling thresholds for each approach across climatic zones this can be done by either modeling erdem et al 2010 or quantifying actual stress using methods like sap flow han et al 2018a or leaf photosynthetic activity parameters luan et al 2021 yuan et al 2004 furthermore the performance of different cwsi approaches with real time data measurements such as continuous soil moisture sensor readings as well as measurements of plant stress indicators i e stomatal conductance transpiration rate and net photosynthetic rate can be valuable lastly the impact of weather on the accuracy of cwsi approaches can be explored as well as the best way to couple soil water measurements and cwsi to improve irrigation management 4 conclusion performance assessment of various cwsi methods is necessary to quantify the detection of crop water stress and how they can be subsequently used in irrigation management the objective of the study was to evaluate cwsi approaches developed based on canopy temperatures tc collected using stationary irts and thermal images in addition sensitivity evaluation of these approaches to soil water dynamics was performed under varying water stress levels in semi arid climate of west central nebraska different approaches which were considered to calculate cwsi included theoretical methods cwsi th1 cwsi th2 and use of empirically developed upper and lower baselines based on meteorological data cwsi eb1 cwsi eb2 as well as artificial cwsi ea and actual natural cwsi en canopy reference surfaces this study has shown that the approach used in developing the limits most of the time influences the accuracy and ranges of cwsi values the empirical lower baseline developed for 2020 maize growing season covering both vegetative and reproductive stages and using measured mid day tc on clear sky and sunny days had a strong linear regression between tc ta and vpd tc ta 1 37 x vpd 1 82 r2 0 81 in addition the lower baseline also had a positive intercept which is common for baselines developed in semi arid climates conversely all cwsi approaches had stronger responses thus higher sensitivity to soil water depletion above 80 at deeper soil depths of 1 8 and 2 1 m the increase in sensitivity were in the order of cwsi th2 cwsi eb2 cwsi th1 cwsi eb1 cwsi en at 2 1 m and cwsi th2 cwsi eb1 cwsi eb2 cwsi th1 cwsi en at 1 8 m soil depth cwsi th2 had the highest sensitivity to d r i with the highest slope of 0 05 at 2 1 m in addition cwsi th1 had a stronger positive correlation yielding r2 0 8 p 0 05 at 2 1 m followed by cwsi eb2 r2 0 79 p 0 05 at 2 1 m cwsi th1 r2 0 78 p 0 05 and cwsi eb1 r2 0 76 p 0 05 both at 1 8 m the findings showed that cwsi varies according to the approach or method used and day to day variations might not reflect changes in soil water content thus each method requires a different threshold i e scheduling trigger value since there is considerable variability across approaches proposed future research include assessment of cwsi approaches to other crop water stress indicators i e stomatal conductance transpiration rate and net photosynthetic rate in addition to continuously monitored soil moisture depletion to establish thresholds exploring the use of stationary timelapse thermal cameras and automated tc extraction software to provide daily tc to employ the index in irrigation management evaluate weather impacts on cwsi accuracy and its sensitivity to soil water depletion and how it impacts the non water stress baseline lastly and as suggested by zhang et al 2021 develop a combined index using both soil water deficit and cwsi to account for both soil and plant feedbacks to improve irrigation water management declaration of competing interest the authors

9553,future climate change fcc and water scarcity significantly affect agricultural production in arid areas plastic film mulching pm combined with large irrigation amounts is popular for agricultural production in these areas crop model is an important tool for studying fcc s effect on crop production and its countermeasures in this study after calibration and validation using measured values from a two year field experiment the spacsys v 6 0 and modified dssat ceres maize v 4 7 0 0 models were used to evaluate the implementation of six management systems three mulching measures transparent

2080s maturity date by 12 7 18 9 d in the 2040s and 19 1 24 8 d in the 2080s and length of reproductive growth period by 3 6 6 1 d in the 2040s and 5 8 11 0 d in the 2080s the i1t1 scenario under transparent film mulching produced the highest yields 12 14 16 07 in the 2040s and 5 36 6 07 in the 2080s higher than the average the i3t4 scenario maintained stable yields in the 2040s decreasing by nearly 20 in the 2080s consequently the i3t4 scenario could be the optimal management practice for balancing yield and irrigation for maize production in this arid area in the future decades

irrigated agriculture modified crop model future climate change plastic film mulching 1 introduction future climate change fcc particularly the increasingly variable spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation and increasing global surface temperatures caused by rising greenhouse gas concentrations will adversely affect agricultural production lobell et al 2013 trnka et al 2014 wang et al 2020a unabated fcc will aggravate the water scarcity problem limiting crop yields piao et al 2010 some studies have identified optimized agronomic management measures or bred new varieties as adaptive measures for fcc wang et al 2019a 2018 while many studies have focused on agricultural development in rainfed areas araya et al 2017 guo et al 2019 few have investigated the impact of fcc on arid irrigated agriculture and its countermeasures despite grain outputs being significantly affected by the dual effects of irrigation and drought zhou and feng 2020 further assessment and analysis of crop responses to fcc in arid irrigation areas are needed to support local policy decisions and determine the adaptive management measures the concept of more crop per drop is widely accepted especially as global agricultural water resources become more scarce monaghan et al 2013 kang et al 2017 dryland agriculture feeds more than one third of the world s population producing at least double the yields of rainfed agriculture the world bank 2020 therefore improving the water use efficiency of arid irrigated agricultural areas is vital for future agricultural development in addition irrigated agriculture faces problems such as nutrient leaching and non point source pollution caused by improper management measures qi et al 2019 xie et al 2020 many field experiments have endeavored to optimize the coupling of irrigation and fertilization to obtain high yields and resource use efficiencies water and nitrogen amouzou et al 2018 si et al 2021 under fcc conditions the effects of traditional management measures irrigation and fertilization on crop yields need further investigation plastic film mulching pm has become a widely used practice for conserving soil water and increasing crop production in arid areas ibrahim et al 2020 studies have shown that pm reduces soil evaporation enhances soil nutrient availability and accelerates crop growth gang et al 2019 lamptey et al 2020 however few studies have focused on the moisture retention effects of long term mulching and its impact on crops under fcc based on different global climate models gcms crop models have been used extensively to determine the impact of fcc on crop production ruan et al 2018 some process based crop models such as dssat and apsim have been used to predict the future development of agriculture taking into account the complex nonlinear relationship between crop growth and climate soil and management araya et al 2015 boote et al 2018 o leary et al 2015 moreover as the driving factor of the model gcm has different effects on agricultural production under different emission scenarios therefore selecting multiple representative climate scenarios is necessary to reflect future agricultural production trends zhu et al 2021 some studies have shown that crop models can simulate crop growth and development and soil water use to determine appropriate agricultural management scenarios lu et al 2019 sándor et al 2017 wang et al 2020b and evaluate and develop policies for food production under fcc and water limited scenarios hammad et al 2018 rotter et al 2012 therefore using crop models to explore water saving and yield increasing effects with pm under fcc has become vital for agricultural development in arid areas the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat model is a widely used crop model for predicting biomass by calculating intercepted solar radiation considering yield reductions caused by different stress factors temperature water nitrogen gijsman et al 2002 jones et al 2003 various studies have reported good model fitting between the observed and simulated yields bai and gao 2021 growth period singh et al 2018 and aboveground biomass amouzou et al 2018 the soil plant atmosphere continuum system model spacsys is a field scale weather driven process based model that can simulate crop growth and development soil nutrient cycling and soil water content swc dynamics wu et al 2007a and is particularly well suited for simulating soil nitrogen movement and transformation zhang et al 2016 compared with dssat the spacsys model uses more parameters to simulate the complex effects of soil water and nitrogen environments on crops studies have calibrated and validated spacsys using crop growth and yield data of maize zhang et al 2016 grassland wu et al 2016 and others the two models produce different simulation results for crop growth and development and water and nutrient utilization due to their different core algorithms therefore it is necessary to compare the performance of these models to get comprehensive and reliable evaluation results for specific research goals the increased mulching of agricultural field areas has seen an increase in modeling to reflect the effect of pm on crops li et al 2019a model improvement for film mulching has mainly included modifying the algorithm to reflect the role of pm in increasing soil temperature reducing soil evaporation and accelerating crop growth miao et al 2016 zou et al 2021 for example the aquacrop model was modified to simulate maize growth under pm based on the theory of a compensatory effect of accumulated soil temperatures on air temperature yang et al 2015 the priestley taylor model was modified by parameterizing the surface soil albedo to calculate evapotranspiration et under pm ai and yang 2016 some studies have shown that the modified film mulching measures in dssat mainly included an et calculation ran et al 2020 and soil water simulation under mulching wang et al 2020b however the modified dssat model needs to consider the simulation effect of phenology crop growth and yield in the overall mechanism dejonge and thorp 2017 the improved effect of dssat was compared with spacsys which has a mature mulching module therefore in this study we used the spacsys and modified dssat models to evaluate the effects of film mulching on arid agriculture and to optimize the sustainable management measures under fcc in order to quantify the maize yield under fcc scenarios and propose the optimum cropping system a two year field experiment was used to evaluate the performance of the spacsys and modified dssat ceres maize models the specific objectives of this research were to 1 assess the performance of the spacsys and modified dssat ceres maize models for simulating crop growth development and swc dynamics 2 evaluate the impact of fcc on crop yield under different management practices 3 propose a optimized irrigation regime for the sustainable development of arid agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description a two year experiment was undertaken during spring maize growing seasons april september in 2019 and 2020 at the shuguang irrigation research station sir 40 43 n 107 13 e altitude 1039 m in the hetao irrigation district hid of the inner mongolia autonomous region northwest

groundwater level ranged from 2 to 3 m across the two seasons 2 2 experimental design and field management a randomized complete block split plot design was used for the experiment the field was divided into three main plots with three mulching practices transparent film mulching t albedo of 11 black film mulching b albedo of 9 and no mulching the subplots had two fertilization levels 225 high h and 150 low l kg n ha 1 that means totally six treatments i e ht hb hn lt lb and ln with triplication for each coming up with a total of 18 plots the plot size was 12 4 m length width comprising eight rows of maize following local conventional practices border irrigation as a type of surface irrigation of 500 mm water was applied as the control miao et al 2018 due to irrigation events being controlled by the water diversion from the yellow river maize crops are generally irrigated four times at the 6 leaf 12 leaf flowering and grain filling stages dong et al 2018 the timing and amounts of irrigation were adjusted according to the weather and crop conditions the irrigation details were list in table 2 irrigated water had an average salinity of around 2 0 ds m 1 and ph of 7 8 the basal fertilizers in the form of urea 46 n and diammonium phosphate 48 p2o5 were broadcasted before sowing and the topdressing in the form of urea 46 n was applied with irrigation water the timing and amounts of fertilizers are in table 3 the maize cultivar jinping 628 was used in this study maize was sown after plowing on april 28 and april 30 and harvested on september 6 and september 8 in 2019 and 2020 respectively after the basal fertilizer applied the soil was covered with 70 cm wide film for the pm treatments and the width of bare soil between two films was 30 cm fig 1 then maize seeds were sown immediately using hole sowing at a depth of 5 cm the row spacing in a mulching strip was 40 cm with 30 cm intra row spacing and the wide row between two strips was 70 cm in width the planting density was 6 67 plants m 2 field management measures also included regular weeding and pesticide applications to control insects 2 3 climate projections historical climate data 1961 2020 were collected from the sir station and the china meteorological data sharing service network http cdc cma gov cn home do daily climate data included maximum temperature t max minimum temperature t min solar radiation rad and precipitation prec the average maize yields at sir came from local agro meteorological experiment stations maintained by the chinese meteorological agency the model simulations from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 considered socioeconomic and climate change and provided a credible source for future climate predictions different climate models represent different trends in future climate development and a series of gcm subsets were selected to represent the future climate with the least possible uncertainty ahmed et al 2020 cannon 2015 hence we selected 27 gcm models to represent future climate change table 4 the socioeconomic pathways ssps and representative concentration pathways rcps were combined to consider the global development of these models li et al 2020 two scenarios were selected ssp245 and ssp585 for ssp245 the rcp4 5 was updated using a moderate world combined with ssp2 to force a moderate level of greenhouse gas ghg emissions for ssp585 the rcp8 5 was updated using a rapid fossil fuel evolution world combined with ssp5 to force a high level of ghg emissions zhang et al 2019 o neill et al 2017 the future daily weather data from 27 gcms were gained for driving crop models dssat and spacsys using the nwai wg statistical downscaling method proposed by liu and zuo 2012 the downscaling method included three main steps spatial downscaling bias correction and temporal downscaling liu and zuo 2012 the inverse distance weighted interpolation method was used to convert gridded values to site data including t max t min rad and prec after finishing the spatial downscaling of monthly data qq mapping was used to build a corresponding function for bias correction indicating the relationship between the projected gcms monthly data in the historical period 1961 2010 and the observed monthly values at the targeted station finally the modified weather generator was used to generate daily weather data for temporal downscaling based on liu and zuo 2012 2 4 data collection and analysis 2 4 1 meteorological data rad mj m 2 t max t min pan evaporation ep mm as the main environmental factors for plant growth fan et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 are shown in fig 1 and fig 2 automatically recorded by the meteorological station 2 4 2 pan evaporation and soil water data a 20 cm diameter evaporation pan was installed in a grass yard within 100 m of the experimental plots daily pan evaporation was measured at 8 00 am swc was determined using the oven dried method 105 c 24 h soil samples were collected with an auger at key growth stages 6 leaf v6 12 leaf v12 flowering vf filling r3 maturity r6 to describe swc dynamics three soil cores were taken randomly from each plot at 10 cm intervals to 20 cm depth and 20 cm intervals from 20 to 60 cm soil profile for the covered field three cores were sampled from under the film and bare land the area weighted average swc over the mulched and bare areas 0 7 under film 0 3 bare soil was calculated under mulching treatments for the bare fields soils were sampled in the center of the row 2 4 3 maize growth index three representative maize plants with uniform growth were selected in each plot at the key growth stages v6 v12 vf r3 r6 to determine leaf area index lai and aboveground biomass ba the lengths and maximal widths of the leaves were measured with a ruler and the area of a leaf was calculated as length width 0 75 montgomery 1911 the leaf area of a plant is the total areas of the three sampled plants divided by 3 then lai was calculated with the average value plus the planting density fresh plants were oven drying at 105 c for 30 min first and then 75 c till constant weight for above ground dry matter maize yield was recorded by collecting 15 ears from the center of each field the harvested samples were sun dried for five days and weighed after threshing the yield was calculated at a grain water content of 15 dong et al 2018 2 5 crop model descriptions and settings the dssat is a user oriented daily time steps crop model which can simulate crop growth development and yield for more than 40 crops the ceres maize model a component of dssat was embedded in the csm cropping system model to call the weather and soil modules to simulate water carbon and nitrogen cycling under the specific management measures irrigation fertilizer and so on in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spam jones et al 2003 the modular structure of dssat allows different components to be easily modified and replaced in our study the current 4 7 version of dssat was modified to simulate the effects of pm more detailed information on dssat ceres maize can be obtained elsewhere jones and kiniry 1986 jones et al 2003 the spacsys model is concerned with crop growth in terms of carbohydrate assimilation plant respiration water and nutrient uptake nitrogen phosphorus photosynthate and nutrient partitioning and root development wu et al 2007a the richards equation was used to simulate soil water and heat fluxes in spacsys nitrogen cycling was coupled with carbon cycling to simulate the transformation of various forms of organic matter and inorganic nitrogen the nox emissions were calculated from nitrification and denitrification processes in soil wu et al 2015 the impacts of different films on water redistribution and heat transformation in soils were considered based on their albedo and film degradation details of the spacsys model and its applicability are available elsewhere wu et al 2007a 2022 the standard version of the spacsys model v6 0 was used to simulate soil water utilization aboveground biomass accumulation and yield to simulate the impacts of the dynamics of the co2 concentration in the models we used the same approaches adopted for cmip3 yang et al 2014 and cmip5 liu et al 2017 by fitting the ipcc reported concentration of co2 values to empirical equations for annual co2 concentrations in our study we fitted the concentration of co2 values for the ssp245 eq 1 and ssp585 eq 2 scenarios of cmip6 obtained from o neill et al 2016 1 c o 2 62 044 34 002 3 8702 y

down in recent years qu et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to set up different irrigation schedules to cope with future climate changes and the reduced water diversion amounts in order to achieve the goals of water saving and stable yield in the irrigation area considering the application of future water reducing policies two reduced water scenarios were built into the study twenty four simulated experiments were used to analyze the yield change for different management practices mulching irrigation under historical conditions and fcc scenarios the scenarios included three irrigation levels i1 600 mm i2 500 mm i3 400 mm four irrigation schemes t1 t2 t3 t4 and two mulching methods transparent film mulching and no mulching the specific irrigation schemes were incorporated by changing the irrigation ratios at different growth stages v6 v2 vf r3 as t1 1 1 1 1 t2 0 5 1 5 1 1 t3 0 5 1 1 5 1 and t4 0 5 1 5 1 5 0 5 all treatments had the same fertilizer measures 225 kg ha 1 n and 150 kg ha 1 p the fertilizer timing and amounts and irrigation timing followed the 2019 field experiment other simulation settings were consistent with the field experiments the duration of film mulching in the simulated scenarios was from sowing to harvest the validated crop models were run for the baseline period 1961 2020 for both observed and downscaled climates and two future periods 2021 2060 2040 s and 2061 2100 2080 s under two scenarios ssp245 and ssp585 the gcms projected crop yields y g c m and the changes δ y g c m were calculated as follows 3 δ y g c m s g c m s b l s o b

validation the dssat and spacsys models need to be calibrated and validated to ensure the accuracy and reliability of simulations liu et al 2018 wang et al 2020b in both models different simulation parameters must be determined for the model evaluation the field data were divided into two parts one to calibrate and the other to validate based on the 2019 field experiment phenology emergence flowering and maturity stage swc y lai and ba were used as the output variables for model calibration for dssat the field data without water and nitrogen limit were inputted using the fao 56 pm approach as et input cuadra et al 2021 marek et al 2017 in 2019 the observed data for the high fertilizer level treatments were used for calibration six common cultivar coefficients were adjusted to match our field data p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint table 5 the trial and error method was used to select a set of reasonable parameters to ensure the accuracy of the simulated phenological stage and simulate crop growth and development soil water consumption and dry matter accumulation amouzou et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 li et al 2019b the spacsys model was run from 2017 to reduce any side effects of the initial values and management wu et al 2020 when a subset of field data in 2019 was used for calibration the albedo of different films and the effective half period were considered table 6 shows the calibrated parameters used in this study the trial and error method was used to calibrate the corresponding parameters in our study both models were validated using data from the 2020 season the simulated results were compared with measured summary variables y phenological phase and maximum lai and time course variables lai swc and ba 2 7 dssat model improvement since the dssat ceres maize model does not incorporate the mulch module it cannot simulate the effects of pm on the soil plant system some modified measures were used to improve the performance of soil water consumption crop growth and development and yield 1 the default method calculating potential evapotranspiration pet in the csm ceres maize model is the priestley taylor model considering strong winds and soil texture in hid the fao56 penman monteith method allen 2006 was used to calculate pet because it considers the impacts of the wind speed relative humidity and the dew point 4 e t 0 0 408 δ r n

evaporation under bare soil and cover is mulching ratio 2 8 statistical analysis both models were evaluated using four statistical indicators the absolute relative error are the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and the index of agreement d to verify the reliability of the results the values of are and rmse can reflect the relative difference between the simulated and the measured values moriasi et al 2007 fan et al 2019 r2 represents the proportion of the variance in measured data explained by the model and d represents the degree to which the observed data are approached by the simulated data and overcome van liew et al 2003 they calculate as 7 a r e s i o i o i 100 8 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 9 r m s e 1 n i 1 n

using anova and spss 14 0 software multiple comparisons of annual mean values were performed using the least significant difference method for all analyses a p value 0 05 was considered significant 3 results 3 1 calibration and evaluation of the dssat and spacsys models 3 1 1 lai and aboveground biomass accumulation the values of the statistical indicators on lai and agb for each model were shown in table 7 the simulated lai values agreed well with the measured data under the hp treatments ht hb and hn in both models figs 3 and 4 however in both seasons the dssat ceres maize model underestimated lai greatly under lp lt lb and ln especially after v12 the lai first increased and then decreased over time with maximum values occurring at 90 110 days after sowing das for all

spacsys model simulated higher swc in the topsoil than the dssat model figs 8 and 9 both models simulated topsoil soil moisture reasonably well and spacsys has a better simulation of subsoil 30 cm moisture than dssat 3 2 future climate change fcc was projected for two climate modes ssp245 and ssp585 using 27 gcm groups the average values of future temperatures t max and t min did not differ under ssp245 or ssp585 in the 2040s fig 10a b most gcm simulated future temperatures increased under ssp245 and ssp585 in the 2080s multi gcms ensemble means showed the average values of t max t min increasing by 0 02 0 25 1 28 2 34 0 02 0 24 and 1 31 2 47 in ssp245 2040s ssp245 2080 s ssp585 2040s and ssp585 2080s respectively for prec most gcm modes indicated increasing trends with the mean prec increasing by 26 6 and 31 9 in the 2040s and 34 6 and 58 2 in the 2080s under ssp245 and ssp585 respectively fig 10c moreover most gcm modes followed a decreasing trend for rad under the fcc scenarios fig 10d across the gcms the average values of rad decreased by 6 8 6 0 6 9 and 8 0 under ssp245 2040s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2040s and ssp585 2080s respectively 3 3 maize phenology change under fcc the adap values for spring maize advanced by 13 5 16 2 d in the 2040s and 15 1 18 7 d in the 2080s in the dssat model figs 11a and 8 1 10 1 d in the 2040s and 12 8 20 3 d in the 2080s in the spacsys model the mdap followed a similar trend to adap advancing by 18 2 18 9 d in the 2040s and 19 6 20 7 d in the 2080s in the dssat model figs 11b and 12 7 14 4 d in the 2040s and 19 1 24 8 d in the 2080s in the spacsys model the advanced adap shortened the crop vegetative growth period vgp and the advanced mdap shortened the whole growth period wgp the advanced adap and mdap also shortened the length of the reproductive growth period rgp by 4 4 6 1 d in the 2040s and 5 8 7 5 d in the 2080s in the dssat model figs 11c and 3 6 4 8 d in the 2040s and 6 8 11 0 d in the 2080s in the spacsys model 3 4 grain yield change under fcc fcc predicted a negative impact on maize yield for most gcms across the 12 management systems especially the no mulch treatments the spacsys model simulated higher average yields than the dssat model especially under mulched conditions figs 12 and 13 generally as the amounts of irrigation decreased crop yields followed a downward trend with mulching measures slowing the downward trend compared with the no mulch treatments crop yields followed an upward trend when optimizing the irrigation scheme at the same irrigation level for example at the 600 mm irrigation level for i1t1 with no mulch average maize yields in both models increased by 1 79 3 93 in the 2040s and decreased by 7 86 7 79 in the 2080s compared with baseline means fig 12a after optimizing the irrigation schemes for i1t4 with no mulch average maize yields in both models increased by 13 50 15 70 in the 2040s and changed by 0 71 1 79 in the 2080s compared with baseline means the int4 n 1 2 3 irrigation scheme under transparent film mulching was considered the best management method for maintaining yield for example under the transparent film mulching with t4 irrigation scheme average maize yields in both models increased by 12 14 16 07 in the 2040s and 5 36 6 07 in the 2080s with level i1 fig 13d increased by 9 09 17 27 in the 2040s and changed by 2 27 4 64 in the 2080s with level i2 at 400 mm irrigation for i1t4 under transparent film mulching average maize yields in both models changed by 7 73 1 82 in the 2040s and decreased by 7 27 15 45 in the 2080s moreover maize yields changed more under ssp585 than the other climate scenarios regardless of the cropping system 4 discussion 4 1 model evaluation in our study the simulated edap adap and mdap were consistent with observed values in all treatments in both seasons tables a1 and a2 however the dssat model did not consider differences in the phenological period caused by pm table a1 some field studies have confirmed that pm promotes crop growth and development ding et al 2019 zou et al 2021 with this accelerated effect incorporated in the spacsys model the accuracy of lai and ba were acceptable with r2 0 789 rmse 2 269 and d 0 702 for the dssat model and r2 0 909 rmse 1 857 and d 0 762 for the spacsys model table 7 suggesting that both models can simulate crop development under pm in an arid region as shown in fig 9a the dssat model slightly underestimated swc while the spacsys model overestimated swc compared with the measured data the spacsys model incorporated a more accurate water movement process in line with actual soil moisture changes than the dssat model fig 7 however large differences in simulated and actual soil moisture data occurred due to soil spatial variability chibarabada et al 2020 dar et al 2017 reported good simulation results of swc using the dssat model incorporating soil water balance components under pm will further improve the dssat model the dssat model had lower simulation accuracy for lai and ba under lp than the spacsys model figs 3 6 for lai and ba the degree of fertilizer stress without mulching was much higher than the simulated values using pm which could be because the film provided adequate soil water and nitrate nitrogen that mitigated nutrient stress better than bare soil however the mitigating effects were not considered in the dssat model deng et al 2006 hou et al 2010 li et al 2018 improving this mulching mechanism on nutrient stress may be the research direction for future models the two models also had different calculation mechanisms for nitrogen stress the dssat model changed the soil environment under mulching affecting soil mineralization ibrahim et al 2020 under insufficient nitrogen fertilizer supply changes in nitrogen migration and transformation may directly affect crop nutrient absorption and thus maize growth ibrahim et al 2020 therefore the dssat model might need a new definition for the nitrogen stress function under mulching the nitrogen transformation algorithm under mulching in the spacsys model is widely accepted wu et al 2015 lai and biomass simulation under nitrogen stress needs further research incorporating the physical and physiological mechanisms of nitrogen movement and transformation therefore the spacsys model outperformed the dssat model in the simulation of maize growth and swc use in an arid region with frequent nitrogen stress the response mechanism of crops to water stress is complicated and it is widely accepted that crop models have low accuracy in simulating the state of crops under stress conditions the dssat model underestimated b and y for lp in both seasons similarly dokoohaki et al 2016 reported large differences between simulated and observed maize yields and biomass under nitrogen stress using the dssat model while we considered the radiation use effect of mulching the effects of soil warming hu et al 2020 root promoting zhou and feng 2020 and their impact on soil nutrients and crop growth under pm need investigation both models simulated pm warming effects on energy transformation and water evaporation which affect soil temperature and moisture in turn they affect nutrient cycling nutrient and water uptake and crop growth li et al 2019a wu et al 2020 however the spacsys model performed better than the dssat model for a series of statistic coefficients table 7 which may be because the spacsys model carefully considers soil environment changes water heat nitrogen under pm and its impact on crops revealing differences between treatments wu et al 2020 these results demonstrate that the spacsys model incorporating the mulching calculation performed better than the dssat model for simulating b and y in an arid region 4 2 climate change and its impact on crops all 27 gcms used in our study had increased average temperatures t max and t min and average prec and decreased average rad values under the fcc scenarios similar to a previous study zhou et al 2017 showing increased average values for temperatures and prec across the hid from 2041 to 2099 the projected increase in prec under fcc would likely alleviate water stress for crop production in the hid generally the increasing temperatures advanced the crop growth period edap and mdap teixeira et al 2018 and shortened the duration of vgp and wgp tao et al 2014 the two models showed that the rgp of spring maize shortened by 3 6 6 1 d in the 2040s and 5 8 11 0 d in the 2080s fig 11 asseng et al 2019 stated that a shortened rgp would result in less photosynthetic accumulation leading to lower biomass and yields the projected rad was lower than the baseline and more pronounced in higher emission scenarios fig 11d one study reported a significant correlation between maize yield and rad chen et al 2013 possibly explaining the decline in maize production capacity we showed that film mulching and optimized irrigation schemes can change the decreasing trend figs 12 and 13 however one study reported delayed crop senescence under pm hu et al 2020 possibly explaining the increased yields another study reported a negative correlation between maize yield and average temperature xiao et al 2021 consistent with our findings because the changing temperature exceeded the optimum temperature range for crop growth xiao and tao 2014 moreover our results showed that average maize yields in the 2040s for i2t1 with no mulch decreased by 10 08 in the dssat model and 6 82 in the spacsys model similar to the 13 2 19 1 decline reported by tao and zhang 2010 generally the photosynthetic production capacity of crops increased with increases co2 concentration wang et al 2018 however the increased co2 concentration did not supplement the restrictions of other meteorological factors t max tmin and rad on local agronomic production i2t1 under film mulching in our study 4 3 adaptation strategy adaptation practices are urgently required for the hid facing fcc and reduced water policy implications for agricultural production ainsworth and long 2005 studies have shown that adaptive management measures such as adjusting sowing date boonwichai et al 2019 breeding new cultivars tao et al 2014 and optimizing the planting system zhang et al 2020 to identify the degree of impact from current agronomic management practices irrigation mulching we investigated the impact of long term management practices on maize yield under fcc figs 12 and 13 twelve simulation scenarios were used including optimized irrigation schemes under mulching and no mulching scenarios our results showed that pm delays the decline in maize yield under different warming scenarios compared with no mulching under the highest irrigation input 600 mm average maize yields for i1t4 under transparent film mulching in both models increased by 12 14 16 07 in the 2040s and 5 36 6 07 in the 2080s under lower irrigation inputs average maize yields followed a decreasing trend by taking the average output reduction of 20 in the 2080s under the two emission scenarios as the threshold the water reduction potential is 200 mm under mulching agricultural development in arid areas should optimize management measures to increase resource utilization efficiencies and maintain stable agricultural outputs based on our results pm measures as fcc countermeasures need to be adhered to for future decades and require optimized irrigation schemes int4 considering water limitations maize yields for i3t4 had stable outputs in the 2040s but decreased by nearly 20 in the 2080s drip irrigation can save up to 57 water and furrow irrigation can save up to 31 water under film mulching compared with traditional border irrigation with the same goal outputs zhang et al 2021 therefore the water saving potential of furrow irrigation and drip irrigation for fcc should be explored zhang et al 2021 reported that on average 10 of the irrigation water is lost through deep percolation under border irrigation increasing the groundwater level gao et al 2017 and soil salinization wang et al 2019b water saving irrigation during crop growth combined with autumn irrigation could reduce salt accumulation in soil the relationship between salt leaching and soil water storage for use by the following crop under fcc needs further investigation based on our findings the improved irrigation method int4 under mulching is the best choice for adapting to fcc in arid areas 4 4 uncertainties in the study we used multiple gcms to reduce simulations of uncertainty under fcc the major sources of uncertainty in yield came from crop models in china wang et al 2020a we selected two crop models to analyze yield change trends and the uncertainty caused by the model structure and core algorithms need further investigation tao et al 2018 while both models showed a good fit with our experiments they did not consider diseases pests or extreme weather effects on crops based on the improved water saving measures reported by zhang et al 2021 more drip and furrow irrigation data is needed to improve the water saving measures for yield under fcc it remains unclear how to achieve the regional simulation estimate based on targeted site research folberth et al 2019 therefore coupling a pointed based model with machine learning was used for largescale simulations while we considered management practices irrigation fertilizer mulching in our study other measures e g change in cultivars sowing date and planting density are crucial for crop production even in arid areas li et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 therefore combining multiple models to determine the interactions among multiple agronomic measures should be investigated 5 conclusion this study used the climate projections from 27 gcms to simulate the effects of agricultural management measures irrigation fertilizer mulching on maize yield in the hid of northwest china the average t max t min showed obvious increase in the 2040s and 2080s under the ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios this is the vital signal for the potential warming effect and aggravated drought condition over the study region the spacsys and modified dssat ceres maize models were well calibrated and validated in terms of maize traits growth phenological phase yield and soil moisture and subsequently used to investigate future climate change impacts on maize in the study area the main findings are as follows 1 the spacsys and modified dssat models overall showed good performance in simulating maize yield above ground biomass and phenology based on the field experiments but the dssat performed poorly in simulating maize growth under low nitrogen treatments compared to spacsys modeling mainly due to the flaws in the crop growth and soil nitrogen balance modules for nitrogen stress conditions 2 the simulated days to flowering maturity and the length of the reproductive growth periods for 2040s and 2080s were shorter for all of future climatic scenarios and the both models showed that maize yield would slightly increase for 2040s with current management practices i2t1 however a decrease in yield under for 2080s was predicted in this region 3 based on the simulation result optimizing the irrigation schemes and using plastic film mulching are predicted to maintain and increase grain yield in the future climate conditions we found i3t4 under transparent film mulching to be the optimum management measure that balanced irrigation consumption and crop yield considering elevated co2 concentration and increased precipitation in future decades planting spring wheat to partly replace maize would be a good choice due to less irrigation needed although the combination of i1t4 measure and transparent film mulching would achieve the highest yield in future decades it will exacerbate the water scarcity in the region these findings suggest that optimized irrigation systems i3t4 under transparent film mulching is important for alleviating fcc and water shortages and developing adaptation strategies to balance tradeoffs between irrigation water resources and food security for arid

9553,future climate change fcc and water scarcity significantly affect agricultural production in arid areas plastic film mulching pm combined with large irrigation amounts is popular for agricultural production in these areas crop model is an important tool for studying fcc s effect on crop production and its countermeasures in this study after calibration and validation using measured values from a two year field experiment the spacsys v 6 0 and modified dssat ceres maize v 4 7 0 0 models were used to evaluate the implementation of six management systems three mulching measures transparent film black film no film two fertilization levels high low and to optimize management measures under fcc both models well simulated maize s anthesis and maturity dates the final aboveground biomass yield and topsoil soil water content swc compared with the measured values spacsys simulated the maize growth and swc under nitrogen stress better than dssat total 27 global climate models gcms were used to drive dssat and spacsys models with different irrigation schemes including three irrigation amounts i1 i2 i3 and four irrigation ratios the proportion of total irrigation amount in different growing stages t1 t2 t3 t4 to simulate crop phenology and yield under fcc in future decades 2040s and 2080s both models advanced the anthesis date by 8 1 16 2 d in the 2040s and 12 8 20 3 d in the 2080s maturity date by 12 7 18 9 d in the 2040s and 19 1 24 8 d in the 2080s and length of reproductive growth period by 3 6 6 1 d in the 2040s and 5 8 11 0 d in the 2080s the i1t1 scenario under transparent film mulching produced the highest yields 12 14 16 07 in the 2040s and 5 36 6 07 in the 2080s higher than the average the i3t4 scenario maintained stable yields in the 2040s decreasing by nearly 20 in the 2080s consequently the i3t4 scenario could be the optimal management practice for balancing yield and irrigation for maize production in this arid area in the future decades

precipitation and increasing global surface temperatures caused by rising greenhouse gas concentrations will adversely affect agricultural production lobell et al 2013 trnka et al 2014 wang et al 2020a unabated fcc will aggravate the water scarcity problem limiting crop yields piao et al 2010 some studies have identified optimized agronomic management measures or bred new varieties as adaptive measures for fcc wang et al 2019a 2018 while many studies have focused on agricultural development in rainfed areas araya et al 2017 guo et al 2019 few have investigated the impact of fcc on arid irrigated agriculture and its countermeasures despite grain outputs being significantly affected by the dual effects of irrigation and drought zhou and feng 2020 further assessment and analysis of crop responses to fcc in arid irrigation areas are needed to support local policy decisions and determine the adaptive management measures the concept of more crop per drop is widely accepted especially as global agricultural water resources become more scarce monaghan et al 2013 kang et al 2017 dryland agriculture feeds more than one third of the world s population producing at least double the yields of rainfed agriculture the world bank 2020 therefore improving the water use efficiency of arid irrigated agricultural areas is vital for future agricultural development in addition irrigated agriculture faces problems such as nutrient leaching and non point source pollution caused by improper management measures qi et al 2019 xie et al 2020 many field experiments have endeavored to optimize the coupling of irrigation and fertilization to obtain high yields and resource use efficiencies water and nitrogen amouzou et al 2018 si et al 2021 under fcc conditions the effects of traditional management measures irrigation and fertilization on crop yields need further investigation plastic film mulching pm has become a widely used practice for conserving soil water and increasing crop production in arid areas ibrahim et al 2020 studies have shown that pm reduces soil evaporation enhances soil nutrient availability and accelerates crop growth gang et al 2019 lamptey et al 2020 however few studies have focused on the moisture retention effects of long term mulching and its impact on crops under fcc based on different global climate models gcms crop models have been used extensively to determine the impact of fcc on crop production ruan et al 2018 some process based crop models such as dssat and apsim have been used to predict the future development of agriculture taking into account the complex nonlinear relationship between crop growth and climate soil and management araya et al 2015 boote et al 2018 o leary et al 2015 moreover as the driving factor of the model gcm has different effects on agricultural production under different emission scenarios therefore selecting multiple representative climate scenarios is necessary to reflect future agricultural production trends zhu et al 2021 some studies have shown that crop models can simulate crop growth and development and soil water use to determine appropriate agricultural management scenarios lu et al 2019 sándor et al 2017 wang et al 2020b and evaluate and develop policies for food production under fcc and water limited scenarios hammad et al 2018 rotter et al 2012 therefore using crop models to explore water saving and yield increasing effects with pm under fcc has become vital for agricultural development in arid areas the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat model is a widely used crop model for predicting biomass by calculating intercepted solar radiation considering yield reductions caused by different stress factors temperature water nitrogen gijsman et al 2002 jones et al 2003 various studies have reported good model fitting between the observed and simulated yields bai and gao 2021 growth period singh et al 2018 and aboveground biomass amouzou et al 2018 the soil plant atmosphere continuum system model spacsys is a field scale weather driven process based model that can simulate crop growth and development soil nutrient cycling and soil water content swc dynamics wu et al 2007a and is particularly well suited for simulating soil nitrogen movement and transformation zhang et al 2016 compared with dssat the spacsys model uses more parameters to simulate the complex effects of soil water and nitrogen environments on crops studies have calibrated and validated spacsys using crop growth and yield data of maize zhang et al 2016 grassland wu et al 2016 and others the two models produce different simulation results for crop growth and development and water and nutrient utilization due to their different core algorithms therefore it is necessary to compare the performance of these models to get comprehensive and reliable evaluation results for specific research goals the increased mulching of agricultural field areas has seen an increase in modeling to reflect the effect of pm on crops li et al 2019a model improvement for film mulching has mainly included modifying the algorithm to reflect the role of pm in increasing soil temperature reducing soil evaporation and accelerating crop growth miao et al 2016 zou et al 2021 for example the aquacrop model was modified to simulate maize growth under pm based on the theory of a compensatory effect of accumulated soil temperatures on air temperature yang et al 2015 the priestley taylor model was modified by parameterizing the surface soil albedo to calculate evapotranspiration et under pm ai and yang 2016 some studies have shown that the modified film mulching measures in dssat mainly included an et calculation ran et al 2020 and soil water simulation under mulching wang et al 2020b however the modified dssat model needs to consider the simulation effect of phenology crop growth and yield in the overall mechanism dejonge and thorp 2017 the improved effect of dssat was compared with spacsys which has a mature mulching module therefore in this study we used the spacsys and modified dssat models to evaluate the effects of film mulching on arid agriculture and to optimize the sustainable management measures under fcc in order to quantify the maize yield under fcc scenarios and propose the optimum cropping system a two year field experiment was used to evaluate the performance of the spacsys and modified dssat ceres maize models the specific objectives of this research were to 1 assess the performance of the spacsys and modified dssat ceres maize models for simulating crop growth development and swc dynamics 2 evaluate the impact of fcc on crop yield under different management practices 3 propose a optimized irrigation regime for the sustainable development of arid agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description a two year experiment was undertaken during spring maize growing seasons april september in 2019 and 2020 at the shuguang irrigation research station sir 40 43 n 107 13 e altitude 1039 m in the hetao irrigation district hid of the inner mongolia autonomous region northwest china which has a typical arid continental climate the average rainfall is 105 mm average temperature is 17 3 and average pan evaporation is 700 mm during the maize growing season the frost free period lasts for 135 150 days and there are more than 3000 annual cumulative sunshine hours the soil in the study area has a distinct layered structure with a silt loam soil from 0 to 60 cm depth and sandy soil from 60 to 100 cm depth usda soil textural triangle the specific physical properties of study soil are listed in table 1 for 0 60 cm depth the soil had 62 35 mg kg 1 available phosphorus 118 35 mg kg 1 available potassium and 17 04 mg kg 1 available nitrogen weather data was automatically recorded by a meteorological station located about 200 m from the experimental field the groundwater level ranged from 2 to 3 m across the two seasons 2 2 experimental design and field management a randomized complete block split plot design was used for the experiment the field was divided into three main plots with three mulching practices transparent film mulching t albedo of 11 black film mulching b albedo of 9 and no mulching the subplots had two fertilization levels 225 high h and 150 low l kg n ha 1 that means totally six treatments i e ht hb hn lt lb and ln with triplication for each coming up with a total of 18 plots the plot size was 12 4 m length width comprising eight rows of maize following local conventional practices border irrigation as a type of surface irrigation of 500 mm water was applied as the control miao et al 2018 due to irrigation events being controlled by the water diversion from the yellow river maize crops are generally irrigated four times at the 6 leaf 12 leaf flowering and grain filling stages dong et al 2018 the timing and amounts of irrigation were adjusted according to the weather and crop conditions the irrigation details were list in table 2 irrigated water had an average salinity of around 2 0 ds m 1 and ph of 7 8 the basal fertilizers in the form of urea 46 n and diammonium phosphate 48 p2o5 were broadcasted before sowing and the topdressing in the form of urea 46 n was applied with irrigation water the timing and amounts of fertilizers are in table 3 the maize cultivar jinping 628 was used in this study maize was sown after plowing on april 28 and april 30 and harvested on september 6 and september 8 in 2019 and 2020 respectively after the basal fertilizer applied the soil was covered with 70 cm wide film for the pm treatments and the width of bare soil between two films was 30 cm fig 1 then maize seeds were sown immediately using hole sowing at a depth of 5 cm the row spacing in a mulching strip was 40 cm with 30 cm intra row spacing and the wide row between two strips was 70 cm in width the planting density was 6 67 plants m 2 field management measures also included regular weeding and pesticide applications to control insects 2 3 climate projections historical climate data 1961 2020 were collected from the sir station and the china meteorological data sharing service network http cdc cma gov cn home do daily climate data included maximum temperature t max minimum temperature t min solar radiation rad and precipitation prec the average maize yields at sir came from local agro meteorological experiment stations maintained by the chinese meteorological agency the model simulations from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 considered socioeconomic and climate change and provided a credible source for future climate predictions different climate models represent different trends in future climate development and a series of gcm subsets were selected to represent the future climate with the least possible uncertainty ahmed et al 2020 cannon 2015 hence we selected 27 gcm models to represent future climate change table 4 the socioeconomic pathways ssps and representative concentration pathways rcps were combined to consider the global development of these models li et al 2020 two scenarios were selected ssp245 and ssp585 for ssp245 the rcp4 5 was updated using a moderate world combined with ssp2 to force a moderate level of greenhouse gas ghg emissions for ssp585 the rcp8 5 was updated using a rapid fossil fuel evolution world combined with ssp5 to force a high level of ghg emissions zhang et al 2019 o neill et al 2017 the future daily weather data from 27 gcms were gained for driving crop models dssat and spacsys using the nwai wg statistical downscaling method proposed by liu and zuo 2012 the downscaling method included three main steps spatial downscaling bias correction and temporal downscaling liu and zuo 2012 the inverse distance weighted interpolation method was used to convert gridded values to site data including t max t min rad and prec after finishing the spatial downscaling of monthly data qq mapping was used to build a corresponding function for bias correction indicating the relationship between the projected gcms monthly data in the historical period 1961 2010 and the observed monthly values at the targeted station finally the modified weather generator was used to generate daily weather data for temporal downscaling based on liu and zuo 2012 2 4 data collection and analysis 2 4 1 meteorological data rad mj m 2 t max t min pan evaporation ep mm as the main environmental

samples were collected with an auger at key growth stages 6 leaf v6 12 leaf v12 flowering vf filling r3 maturity r6 to describe swc dynamics three soil cores were taken randomly from each plot at 10 cm intervals to 20 cm depth and 20 cm intervals from 20 to 60 cm soil profile for the covered field three cores were sampled from under the film and bare land the area weighted average swc over the mulched and bare areas 0 7 under film 0 3 bare soil was calculated under mulching treatments for the bare fields soils were sampled in the center of the row 2 4 3 maize growth index three representative maize plants with uniform growth were selected in each plot at the key growth stages v6 v12 vf r3 r6 to determine leaf area index lai and aboveground biomass ba the lengths and maximal widths of the leaves were measured with a ruler and the area of a leaf was calculated as length width 0 75 montgomery 1911 the leaf area of a plant is the total areas of the three sampled plants divided by 3 then lai was calculated with the average value plus the planting density fresh plants were oven drying at 105 c for 30 min first and then 75 c till constant weight for above ground dry matter maize yield was recorded by collecting 15 ears from the center of each field the harvested samples were sun dried for five days and weighed after threshing the yield was calculated at a grain

40 crops the ceres maize model a component of dssat was embedded in the csm cropping system model to call the weather and soil modules to simulate water carbon and nitrogen cycling under the specific management measures irrigation fertilizer and so on in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spam jones et al 2003 the modular structure of dssat allows different components to be easily modified and replaced in our study the current 4 7 version of dssat was modified to simulate the effects of pm more detailed information on dssat ceres maize can be obtained elsewhere jones and kiniry 1986 jones et al 2003 the spacsys model is concerned with crop growth in terms of carbohydrate assimilation plant respiration water and nutrient uptake nitrogen phosphorus photosynthate and nutrient partitioning and root development wu et al 2007a the richards equation was used to simulate soil water and heat fluxes in spacsys nitrogen cycling was coupled with carbon cycling to simulate the transformation of various forms of organic matter and inorganic nitrogen the nox emissions were calculated from nitrification and denitrification processes in soil wu et al 2015 the impacts of different films on water redistribution and heat transformation in soils were considered based on their albedo and film degradation details of the spacsys model and its applicability are available elsewhere wu et al 2007a 2022 the standard version of the spacsys model v6 0 was used to simulate soil water utilization aboveground biomass accumulation and yield to simulate the impacts of the dynamics of the co2 concentration in the models we used the same approaches adopted for cmip3 yang et al 2014 and cmip5 liu et al 2017 by fitting the ipcc reported concentration of co2 values to empirical equations for annual co2 concentrations in our study we fitted the concentration of co2 values for the ssp245 eq 1 and ssp585 eq 2 scenarios of cmip6 obtained from o neill et al 2016 1 c o 2 62 044 34 002 3 8702 y

down in recent years qu et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to set up different irrigation schedules to cope with future climate changes and the reduced water diversion amounts in order to achieve the goals of water saving and stable yield in the irrigation area considering the application of future water reducing policies two reduced water scenarios were built into the study twenty four simulated experiments were used to analyze the yield change for different management practices mulching irrigation under historical conditions and fcc scenarios the scenarios included three irrigation levels i1 600 mm i2 500 mm i3 400 mm four irrigation schemes t1 t2 t3 t4 and two mulching methods transparent film mulching and no mulching the specific irrigation schemes were incorporated by changing the irrigation ratios at different growth stages v6 v2 vf r3 as t1 1 1 1 1 t2 0 5 1 5 1 1 t3 0 5 1 1 5 1 and t4 0 5 1 5 1 5 0 5 all treatments had the same fertilizer measures 225 kg ha 1 n and 150 kg ha 1 p the fertilizer timing and amounts and irrigation timing followed the 2019 field experiment other simulation settings were consistent with the field experiments the duration of film mulching in the simulated scenarios was from sowing to harvest the validated crop models were run for the baseline period 1961 2020 for both observed and downscaled climates and two future periods 2021 2060 2040 s and 2061 2100 2080 s under two scenarios ssp245 and ssp585 the gcms projected crop yields y g c m and the changes δ y g c m were calculated as follows 3 δ y g c m s g c m s b l s o b

validation the dssat and spacsys models need to be calibrated and validated to ensure the accuracy and reliability of simulations liu et al 2018 wang et al 2020b in both models different simulation parameters must be determined for the model evaluation the field data were divided into two parts one to calibrate and the other to validate based on the 2019 field experiment phenology emergence flowering and maturity stage swc y lai and ba were used as the output variables for model calibration for dssat the field data without water and nitrogen limit were inputted using the fao 56 pm approach as et input cuadra et al 2021 marek et al 2017 in 2019 the observed data for the high fertilizer level treatments were used for calibration six common cultivar coefficients were adjusted to match our field data p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint table 5 the trial and error method was used to select a set of reasonable parameters to ensure the accuracy of the simulated phenological stage and simulate crop growth and development soil water consumption and dry matter accumulation amouzou et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 li et al 2019b the spacsys model was run from 2017 to reduce any side effects of the initial values and management wu et al 2020 when a subset of field data in 2019 was used for calibration the albedo of different films and the effective half period were considered table 6 shows the calibrated parameters used in this study the trial and error method was used to calibrate the corresponding parameters in our study both models were validated using data from the 2020 season the simulated results were compared with measured summary variables y phenological phase and maximum lai and time course variables lai swc and ba 2 7 dssat model improvement since the dssat ceres maize model does not incorporate the mulch module it cannot simulate the effects of pm on the soil plant system some modified measures were used to improve the performance of soil water consumption crop growth and development and yield 1 the default method calculating potential evapotranspiration pet in the csm ceres maize model is the priestley taylor model considering strong winds and soil texture in hid the fao56 penman monteith method allen 2006 was used to calculate pet because it considers the impacts of the wind speed relative humidity and the dew point 4 e t 0 0 408 δ r n

evaporation under bare soil and cover is mulching ratio 2 8 statistical analysis both models were evaluated using four statistical indicators the absolute relative error are the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and the index of agreement d to verify the reliability of the results the values of are and rmse can reflect the relative difference between the simulated and the measured values moriasi et al 2007 fan et al 2019 r2 represents the proportion of the variance in measured data explained by the model and d represents the degree to which the observed data are approached by the simulated data and overcome van liew et al 2003 they calculate as 7 a r e s i o i o i 100 8 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 9 r m s e 1 n i 1 n

using anova and spss 14 0 software multiple comparisons of annual mean values were performed using the least significant difference method for all analyses a p value 0 05 was considered significant 3 results 3 1 calibration and evaluation of the dssat and spacsys models 3 1 1 lai and aboveground biomass accumulation the values of the statistical indicators on lai and agb for each model were shown in table 7 the simulated lai values agreed well with the measured data under the hp treatments ht hb and hn in both models figs 3 and 4 however in both seasons the dssat ceres maize model underestimated lai greatly under lp lt lb and ln especially after v12 the lai first increased and then decreased over time with maximum values occurring at 90 110 days after sowing das for all treatments the simulated lai in both seasons fitted well with the observed data r2 0 789 and 0 909 rmse 0 735 and 0 400 d 0 702 and 0 844 in the dssat and spacsys models respectively table 7 simulated ba from spacsys agreed well with the measured data under all the treatments however the dssat model underestimated it in general especially in 2019 figs 5 and 6 after v12 the observed ba values were higher than the simulated values in the dssat model under lp more so in the low rainfall year 2019 the simulated ba in both seasons fitted well with the field data r2 0 944 and 0 978 rmse 2 269 and 1 857 d 0 844 and 0 762 for the dssat and spacsys models respectively table 7 3 1 2 phenology final biomass yield and harvest index after parameterization the optimal parameters were inputted into the models to verify maize phenology yield y and final aboveground biomass b see tables a1 and a2 the simulated dates for emergence edap anthesis adap physiological maturity mdap b and y fitted well with the field observations in the calibration year edap adap mdap b and y had average are coefficients of 4 94 0 84 0 82 7 82 and 8 15 respectively for the dssat model and 9 89 2 74 3 33 13 32 and 8 57 respectively for the spacsys model the errors of simulated values increased in the validation year for the dssat model in the validation year edap adap mdap b and y had average are coefficients of 7 97 3 05 1 78 7 72 and 8 86 for the dssat model and 8 52 4 36 4 81 4 59 and 6 27 for the spacsys model respectively these results show that both models had good simulation effects for the phenological period however b and y had larger deviations between simulated and observed values in general both models simulated values under hp better than under lp the simulation accuracy of maize b y and harvest index hi data by both models was further evaluated using other statistical parameters table 7 model accuracy for the simulated b in both seasons was relatively high r2 0 457 and 0 832 rmse 1 825 and 2 146 d 0 721 and 0 736 for the dssat and spacsys models respectively for crop yield in both seasons r2 0 394 and 0 584 rmse 1 308 and 0 978 and d 0 710 and 0 812 for the dssat and spacsys models respectively differences between simulated and observed values were highest for hi in both models e g r2 0 256 rmse 4 873 d 0 692 for the spacsys model scatter plots were used to illustrate simulation bias between the simulated and measured data with the simulated ba and y in both models close to the observed data fig 7 3 1 3 soil water content the simulated swc by both models generally followed the field measured data in both seasons figs 8 and 9 the dssat model simulated higher swc variation in the topsoil 0 30 cm and subsoil 30 60 cm than the spacsys model the simulated swc values fitted well with the measured values in the topsoil layer r2 0 722 and 0 701 rmse 0 054 and 0 103 d 0 648 and 0 506 and the subsoil layer r2 0 661 and 0 618 rmse 0 053 and 0 029 d 0 524 and 0 606 for the dssat and spacsys models respectively tables 8 and 9 the simulated swc for all treatments followed the same trend with swc in topsoil and subsoil under hp plotted as the example generally the spacsys model simulated higher swc in the topsoil than the dssat model figs 8 and 9 both models simulated topsoil soil moisture reasonably well and spacsys has a better simulation of subsoil 30 cm moisture than dssat 3 2 future climate change fcc was projected for two climate modes ssp245 and ssp585 using 27 gcm groups the average values of future temperatures t max and t min did not differ under ssp245 or ssp585 in the 2040s fig 10a b most gcm simulated future temperatures increased under ssp245 and ssp585 in the 2080s multi gcms ensemble means showed the average values of t max t min increasing by 0 02 0 25 1 28 2 34 0 02 0 24 and 1 31 2 47 in ssp245 2040s ssp245 2080 s ssp585 2040s and ssp585 2080s respectively for prec most gcm modes indicated increasing trends with the mean prec increasing by 26 6 and 31 9 in the 2040s and 34 6 and 58 2 in the 2080s under ssp245 and ssp585 respectively fig 10c moreover most gcm modes followed a decreasing trend for rad under the fcc scenarios fig 10d across the gcms the average values of rad decreased by 6 8 6 0 6 9 and 8 0 under ssp245 2040s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2040s and ssp585 2080s respectively 3 3 maize phenology change under fcc the adap values for spring maize advanced by 13 5 16 2 d in the 2040s and 15 1 18 7 d in the 2080s in the dssat model figs 11a and 8 1 10 1 d in the 2040s and 12 8 20 3 d in the 2080s in the spacsys model the mdap followed a similar trend to adap advancing by 18 2 18 9 d in the 2040s and 19 6 20 7 d in the 2080s in the dssat model figs 11b and 12 7 14 4 d in the 2040s and 19 1 24 8 d in the 2080s in the spacsys model the advanced adap shortened the crop vegetative growth period vgp and the advanced mdap shortened the whole growth period wgp the advanced adap and mdap also shortened the length of the reproductive growth period rgp by 4 4 6 1 d in the 2040s and 5 8 7 5 d in the 2080s in the dssat model figs 11c and 3 6 4 8 d in the 2040s and 6 8 11 0 d in the 2080s in the spacsys model 3 4 grain yield change under fcc fcc predicted a negative impact on maize yield for most gcms across the 12 management systems especially the no mulch treatments the spacsys model simulated higher average yields than the dssat model especially under mulched conditions figs 12 and 13 generally as the amounts of irrigation decreased crop yields followed a downward trend with mulching measures slowing the downward trend compared with the no mulch treatments crop yields followed an upward trend when optimizing the irrigation scheme at the same irrigation level for example at the 600 mm irrigation level for i1t1 with no mulch average maize yields in both models increased by 1 79 3 93 in the 2040s and decreased by 7 86 7 79 in the 2080s compared with baseline means fig 12a after optimizing the irrigation schemes for i1t4 with no mulch average maize yields in both models increased by 13 50 15 70 in the 2040s and changed by 0 71 1 79 in the 2080s compared with baseline means the int4 n 1 2 3 irrigation scheme under transparent film mulching was considered the best management method for maintaining yield for example under the transparent film mulching with t4 irrigation scheme average maize yields in both models increased by 12 14 16 07 in the 2040s and 5 36 6 07 in the 2080s with level i1 fig 13d increased by 9 09 17 27 in the 2040s and changed by 2 27 4 64 in the 2080s with level i2 at 400 mm irrigation for i1t4 under transparent film mulching average maize yields in both models changed by 7 73 1 82 in the 2040s and decreased by 7 27 15 45 in the 2080s moreover maize yields changed more under ssp585 than the other climate scenarios regardless of the cropping system 4 discussion 4 1 model evaluation in our study the simulated edap adap and mdap were consistent with observed values in all treatments in both seasons tables a1 and a2 however the dssat model did not consider differences in the phenological period caused by pm table a1 some field studies have confirmed that pm promotes crop growth and development ding et al 2019 zou et al 2021 with this accelerated effect incorporated in the spacsys model the accuracy of lai and ba were acceptable with r2 0 789 rmse 2 269 and d 0 702 for the dssat model and r2 0 909 rmse 1 857 and d 0 762 for the spacsys model table 7 suggesting that both models can simulate crop development under pm in an arid region as shown in fig 9a the dssat model slightly underestimated swc while the spacsys model overestimated swc compared with the measured data the spacsys model incorporated a more accurate water movement process in line with actual soil moisture changes than the dssat model fig 7 however large differences in simulated and actual soil moisture data occurred due to soil spatial variability chibarabada et al 2020 dar et al 2017 reported good simulation results of swc using the dssat model incorporating soil water balance components under pm will further improve the dssat model the dssat model had lower simulation accuracy for lai and ba under lp than the spacsys model figs 3 6 for lai and ba the degree of fertilizer stress without mulching was much higher than the simulated values using pm which could be because the film provided adequate soil water and nitrate nitrogen that mitigated nutrient stress better than bare soil however the mitigating effects were not considered in the dssat model deng et al 2006 hou et al 2010 li et al 2018 improving this mulching mechanism on nutrient stress may be the research direction for future models the two models also had different calculation mechanisms for nitrogen stress the dssat model changed the soil environment under mulching affecting soil mineralization ibrahim et al 2020 under insufficient nitrogen fertilizer supply changes in nitrogen migration and transformation may directly affect crop nutrient absorption and thus maize growth ibrahim et al 2020 therefore the dssat model might need a new definition for the nitrogen stress function under mulching the nitrogen transformation algorithm under mulching in the spacsys model is widely accepted wu et al 2015 lai and biomass simulation under nitrogen stress needs further research incorporating the physical and physiological mechanisms of nitrogen movement and transformation therefore the spacsys model outperformed the dssat model in the simulation of maize growth and swc use in an arid region with frequent nitrogen stress the response mechanism of crops to water stress is complicated and it is widely accepted that crop models have low accuracy in simulating the state of crops under stress conditions the dssat model underestimated b and y for lp in both seasons similarly dokoohaki et al 2016 reported large differences between simulated and observed maize yields and biomass under nitrogen stress using the dssat model while we considered the radiation use effect of mulching the effects of soil warming hu et al 2020 root promoting zhou and feng 2020 and their impact on soil nutrients and crop growth under pm need investigation both models simulated pm warming effects on energy transformation and water evaporation which affect soil temperature and moisture in turn they affect nutrient cycling nutrient and water uptake and crop growth li et al 2019a wu et al 2020 however the spacsys model performed better than the dssat model for a series of statistic coefficients table 7 which may be because the spacsys model carefully considers soil environment changes water heat nitrogen under pm and its impact on crops revealing differences between treatments wu et al 2020 these results demonstrate that the spacsys model incorporating the mulching calculation performed better than the dssat model for simulating b and y in an arid region 4 2 climate change and its impact on crops all 27 gcms used in our study had increased average temperatures t max and t min and average prec and decreased average rad values under the fcc scenarios similar to a previous study zhou et al 2017 showing increased average values for temperatures and prec across the hid from 2041 to 2099 the projected increase in prec under fcc would likely alleviate water stress for crop production in the hid generally the increasing temperatures advanced the crop growth period edap and mdap teixeira et al 2018 and shortened the duration of vgp and wgp tao et al 2014 the two models showed that the rgp of spring maize shortened by 3 6 6 1 d in the 2040s and 5 8 11 0 d in the 2080s fig 11 asseng et al 2019 stated that a shortened rgp would result in less photosynthetic accumulation leading to lower biomass and yields the projected rad was lower than the baseline and more pronounced in higher emission scenarios fig 11d one study reported a significant correlation between maize yield and rad chen et al 2013 possibly explaining the decline in maize production capacity we showed that film mulching and optimized irrigation schemes can change the decreasing trend figs 12 and 13 however one study reported delayed crop senescence under pm hu et al 2020 possibly explaining the increased yields another study reported a negative correlation between maize yield and average temperature xiao et al 2021 consistent with our findings because the changing temperature exceeded the optimum temperature range for crop growth xiao and tao 2014 moreover our results showed that average maize yields in the 2040s for i2t1 with no mulch decreased by 10 08 in the dssat model and 6 82 in the spacsys model similar to the 13 2 19 1 decline reported by tao and zhang 2010 generally the photosynthetic production capacity of crops increased with increases co2 concentration wang et al 2018 however the increased co2 concentration did not supplement the restrictions of other meteorological factors t max tmin and rad on local agronomic production i2t1 under film mulching in our study 4 3 adaptation strategy adaptation practices are urgently required for the hid facing fcc and reduced water policy implications for agricultural production ainsworth and long 2005 studies have shown that adaptive management measures such as adjusting sowing date boonwichai et al 2019 breeding new cultivars tao et al 2014 and optimizing the planting system zhang et al 2020 to identify the degree of impact from current agronomic management practices irrigation mulching we investigated the impact of long term management practices on maize yield under fcc figs 12 and 13 twelve simulation scenarios were used including optimized irrigation schemes under mulching and no mulching scenarios our results showed that pm delays the decline in maize yield under different warming scenarios compared with no mulching under the highest irrigation input 600 mm average maize yields for i1t4 under transparent film mulching in both models increased by 12 14 16 07 in the 2040s and 5 36 6 07 in the 2080s under lower irrigation inputs average maize yields followed a decreasing trend by taking the average output reduction of 20 in the 2080s under the two emission scenarios as the threshold the water reduction potential is 200 mm under mulching agricultural development in arid areas should optimize management measures to increase resource utilization efficiencies and maintain stable agricultural outputs based on our results pm measures as fcc countermeasures need to be adhered to for future decades and require optimized irrigation schemes int4 considering water limitations maize yields for i3t4 had stable outputs in the 2040s but decreased by nearly 20 in the 2080s drip irrigation can save up to 57 water and furrow irrigation can save up to 31 water under film mulching compared with traditional border irrigation with the same goal outputs zhang et al 2021 therefore the water saving potential of furrow irrigation and drip irrigation for fcc should be explored zhang et al 2021 reported that on average 10 of the irrigation water is lost through deep percolation under border irrigation increasing the groundwater level gao et al 2017 and soil salinization wang et al 2019b water saving irrigation during crop growth combined with autumn irrigation could reduce salt accumulation in soil the relationship between salt leaching and soil water storage for use by the following crop under fcc needs further investigation based on our findings the improved irrigation method int4 under mulching is the best choice for adapting to fcc in arid areas 4 4 uncertainties in the study we used multiple gcms to reduce simulations of uncertainty under fcc the major sources of uncertainty in yield came from crop models in china wang et al 2020a we selected two crop models to analyze yield change trends and the uncertainty caused by the model structure and core algorithms need further investigation tao et al 2018 while both models showed a good fit with our experiments they did not consider diseases pests or extreme weather effects on crops based on the improved water saving measures reported by zhang et al 2021 more drip and furrow irrigation data is needed to improve the water saving measures for yield under fcc it remains unclear how to achieve the regional simulation estimate based on targeted site research folberth et al 2019 therefore coupling a pointed based model with machine learning was used for largescale simulations while we considered management practices irrigation fertilizer mulching in our study other measures e g change in cultivars sowing date and planting density are crucial for crop production even in arid areas li et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 therefore combining multiple models to determine the interactions among multiple agronomic measures should be investigated 5 conclusion this study used the climate projections from 27 gcms to simulate the effects of agricultural management measures irrigation fertilizer mulching on maize yield in the hid of northwest china the average t max t min showed obvious increase in the 2040s and 2080s under the ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios this is the vital signal for the potential warming effect and aggravated drought condition over the study region the spacsys and modified dssat ceres maize models were well calibrated and validated in terms of maize traits growth phenological phase yield and soil moisture and subsequently used to investigate future climate change impacts on maize in the study area the main findings are as follows 1 the spacsys and modified dssat models overall showed good performance in simulating maize yield above ground biomass and phenology based on the field experiments but the dssat performed poorly in simulating maize growth under low nitrogen treatments compared to spacsys modeling mainly due to the flaws in the crop growth and soil nitrogen balance modules for nitrogen stress conditions 2 the simulated days to flowering maturity and the length of the reproductive growth periods for 2040s and 2080s were shorter for all of future climatic scenarios and the both models showed that maize yield would slightly increase for 2040s with current management practices i2t1 however a decrease in yield under for 2080s was predicted in this region 3 based on the simulation result optimizing the irrigation schemes and using plastic film mulching are predicted to maintain and increase grain yield in the future climate conditions we found i3t4 under transparent film mulching to be the optimum management measure that balanced irrigation consumption and crop yield considering elevated co2 concentration and increased precipitation in future decades planting spring wheat to partly replace maize would be a good choice due to less irrigation needed although the combination of i1t4 measure and transparent film mulching would achieve the highest yield in future decades it will exacerbate the water scarcity in the region these findings suggest that optimized irrigation systems i3t4 under transparent film mulching is important for alleviating fcc and water shortages and developing adaptation strategies to balance tradeoffs between irrigation water resources and food security for arid

in a granular bed which needs to be replaced once its life span has been reached silica sand is the most common material used as a filtration bed but the use of alternative materials which may improve filtration efficiency and reduce environmental impact should be explored thus the aim of this study was to compare the effect of two different granular media silica sand and recycled glass used in three filters with different underdrain designs collector arms inserted domes and porous media on emitter clogging experiments were carried out by filtering a reclaimed effluent for the duration of 1000 h for each filter and material four irrigation laterals 90 m in length with a 2 3 l h pressure compensating emitter placed every 0 40 m along the dripline were placed after each filter filter performances were continuously assessed while emitter discharges at 8 selected locations across the laterals were measured at the beginning after 500 h and at the end of the experiment filtration cycles lasted longer with recycled glass but turbidity removal was affected by the combination of bed material and underdrain only after 1000 h of irrigation was the discharge significantly lower for those emitters protected with porous underdrain using glass compared with sand emitter discharge was considerably reduced at the end of the lateral due to a higher number of completely clogged emitters at this location but there were not significant differences between granular materials and filter designs overall the results show that using recycled glass does not significantly increase emitter clogging compared with silica sand keywords effluent sustainability clogging microirrigation filtration 1 introduction irrigation with reclaimed effluents instead of fresh water has many potential advantages such as the conservation of potable water resources the use of the nutrients present in the effluent by the crop and a favorable cost benefit ratio trooien and hills 2007 drip irrigation systems are especially suitable for applying reclaimed effluent since effluent exposure to plants and humans is minimized in regard to other irrigation methods such as sprinkler irrigation trooien and hills 2007 although effluents contain many physical and chemical substances as well as microorganisms and their metabolites which can readily clog emitters and affect water distribution uniformity and system operation solé torres et al 2021 continued advances in system design management and monitoring have expanded the use of reclaimed effluents through drip irrigation systems trooien and hills 2007 however preventing emitter clogging is still a challenge that can be tackled by installing suitable emitters trooien et al 2000 zhou et al 2019 filtering the effluent properly and effectively ravina et al 1997 and suppressing microbiological growth and chemical precipitation in the effluent using acidification oxidation and disinfection treatments green et al 2018 hao et al 2018 flushing those accumulated sediments in the driplines puig bargués et al 2010b li et al 2015 and monitoring system performance to assure that partial clogging can be treated before it becomes unrecoverable ravina et al 1997 solé torres et al 2019a are also recommended practices pressurized media filters which have a granular bed placed inside a tank are widely used in drip irrigation systems since they require less surface area than gravity media filters nakayama et al 2007 inorganic and organic particles carried by the irrigation water are trapped throughout the media bed by different and simultaneous mechanisms such as straining sedimentation interception diffusion inertia and hydrodynamic action cescon and jiang 2020 since particles can be caught across the filtration bed and not only on its surface media filters are more efficient in preventing emitter clogging when reclaimed effluents are used compared to other pressurized filters commonly used in drip irrigation systems such as screen and disc filters ravina et al 1997 capra and scicolone 2004 duran ros et al 2009a as the media pores become plugged with pollutants the pressure drop across the filter increases until it is necessary to backwash the granular bed to remove the accumulated contaminants and restore appropriate filtration conditions the removal efficiency achieved by media filters highly relies on backwashing elbana et al 2012 which therefore should be carried out as frequently as possible enciso medina et al 2011 as both filtration and backwashing performance depend on filter design de deus et al 2020 some researchers have been focused on improving the main auxiliary elements of these filters i e diffuser plate mesquita et al 2019 and underdrain pujol et al 2016 2020 aiming to have more uniform water flow across the media and therefore less pressure loss the effect of these changes on filter design and its performance on emitter clogging has not been broadly analyzed recently the study of the effect of different underdrain designs of sand filters on filter performance solé torres et al 2019c and emitter clogging solé torres et al 2019b showed some differences on emitter discharge regarding the underdrain design filter removal efficiency is greatly affected by the physical characteristics of the granular media such as grain size shape and porosity cescon and jian 2020 smaller grain sizes allow higher solid removal elbana et al 2012 wu et al 2015 but head losses are subsequently higher silica sand is the most commonly used medium in pressurized drip irrigation filters nakayama et al 2007 due to its low cost and wide availability other naturally available materials such as anthracite pumice kuslu and sahin 2013 and basalt zaki et al 2021 have also been used in pressurized media filters in gravity filters used for water treatment for urban irrigation or environmental purposes bark activated charcoal dalahmeh et al 2012 lapilli falcón cardona et al 2015 and even some crop wastes ali et al 2016 kaetzl et al 2019 have also been tested the study of new materials that allow higher filter performance lower costs and more energy efficient use is attracting more attention cescon and jiang 2020 in addition since bed media need to be periodically replaced once they reach the end of their life span the use of sustainable materials could facilitate a reduction in the environmental impact bové et al 2018 among these type of materials recycled glass has been investigated as a possible replacement for sand due to its similar physical characteristics cescon and jian 2020 soyer et al 2010 found that recycled glass achieves equivalent turbidity outlet values and lower head loss than sand in pressurized filters nevertheless there is no available information as to if there would be any effect of the use of recycled glass as a filter medium in drip irrigation systems on emitter clogging thus the main objective of this study was to analyze the effect of two different granular media silica sand and recycled glass used in three sand filters with different underdrain designs on emitter clogging when a reclaimed effluent is used 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was carried out at the facilities of the celrà girona spain wastewater treatment plant using the effluent of a sludge process that treats urban and industrial wastewaters three filters with different underdrain designs were used fig 1 the first one model fa f2 188 regaber parets del vallès spain had inserted domes the second one model fa1m lama gelves spain arm collectors and the third one was a prototype with a porous media underdrain bové et al 2017 filled with silica sand sieved to 0 75 0 85 mm grain size further details regarding underdrain characteristics can be found in solé torres et al 2019c after each filter four laterals 90 m in length each with emitters spaced 0 4 m apart were installed all the driplines had the same 2 3 l h rated discharge integrated pressure compensating emitter model uniram as 16010 netafim tel aviv israel with a 3 manufacturing coefficient of variation two different filter media were tested the first one was ca 07ms silica sand sibelco minerales bilbao spain with an effective diameter d10 size opening which passes 10 by dry weight of a representative sample of the filter material of 0 48 mm a uniformity coefficient ratio of the size opening which passes 60 of the sand through the size opening which passes 10 through of 1 73 and a porosity fraction of the volume of voids over the total medium volume which was determined following bové et al 2015 with the ratio between the bulk and real densities experimentally measured of 0 39 the second media was nw2 recycled glass nature works tecnologías l alfàs del pi spain with an effective diameter d10 of 0 44 mm a uniformity coefficient of 1 59 and a porosity of 0 54 a multicellular centrifugal pump model cr 15 4 grundfos bjerringbro denmark governed by a frequency variator model frn 4 fuji electric cerdanyola del vallès spain pumped the reclaimed effluent from the wwtp outlet chamber to the filters a dmed300t2 energy meter lovato electric gorle italy allowed the determination of the electrical energy consumption of the pump the filter inlet flow was measured with an isomag ms2500 isoil industria cinisello balsamo italy electromagnetic flowmeter once filtered the effluent was conveyed to irrigation laterals since the filtrated flow was higher than what was needed for the laterals a proportional electrohydraulic actuator skd32 siemens munich germany operated a three way valve vxg41 siemens munich germany so that the excess flow was carried to a water storage tank of 3000 l aquablock shütz selters germany which was used for filter backwashing a chlorine deposit of 200 l was installed to continuously inject chlorine to achieve a concentration of 2 mg l in the effluent after being filtered using a dostec ac1 2 membrane pump itc santa perpètua de la mogoda spain when sand filters were backwashed chlorine concentration of the backwashing water was increased by up to 4 mg l effluent electrical conductivity ph and temperature were measured at the filter inlet using sensors cls21 c1e4a and cps11d 7ba21 endress hauser gerlingen germany respectively while turbidity and dissolved oxygen were determined at both the filter inlet and outlet with sensors cus31 a2e and cos 61 a1f0 endress hauser gerlingen germany respectively since the experimental facility had only one set of sensors for measuring effluent quality each filter operated individually two additional pressure transducers model tm 01 c step logística y control barcelona spain measured the pressure at the inlet and outlet of each filter all the filters were automatically backwashed when the total pressure drop across them reached 50 kpa backwashing was carried out for 3 min with backwashing water volume determined by a wp dynamic dn 50 sensus raleigh nc usa turbine volume meter with an impulse emitter a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system previously developed duran ros et al 2008 allowed irrigation system operation in addition the scada system recorded data of pump electricity consumption pressure filter inlet flow filtration cycle duration backwashing volume and those quality parameters of the effluent at both the filter inlet and outlet every minute the scada system was programmed to stop irrigation when inlet turbidity was above 50 ftu avoiding operation with high particle loads 2 2 operational procedure each filter and media were tested for 1000 h since this is the media lifespan recommended by the manufacturers experiments with silica sand took place between march and november 2018 with a pause during june due to a breakdown of turbidity sensors recycled glass was tested from june 2019 to march 2020 with several breakdowns due to high turbidity loads caused by operational problems in the treatment plant each filter ran for two daily sessions of 4 h two different media heights 20 and 30 cm and two different filtration velocities 30 and 60 m h were tested during 250 h for each media and underdrain design no lateral flushing was carried out during the experiment 2 3 assessment of filter and emitter performance filter performance for removing turbidity and dissolved oxygen was assessed by computing the removal efficiency e achieved in the filters as e no n no 100 1 being n0 and n turbidity and dissolved oxygen values at filter inlet and outlet respectively at the beginning 0 h middle 500 h and end 1000 h of the experiment flow discharges for two contiguous emitters placed at 0 10 33 40 59 66 90 and 100 of the distances along the lateral length were measured these measurement locations include those suggested by merriam and keller 1978 and juana et al 2007 emitter discharge was collected for 5 min in collection dishes and then transferred to a graduated cylinder to be measured during the emitter discharge measurements pressure was also determined in four locations on each lateral 0 33 66 and 100 of lateral length using a leo 2 digital manometer keller winterhur switzerland with a precision of 0 07 that was placed at a pressure intake ein tal or akiva israel pressure uniformity of pressures uplq bliesner 1976 was calculated as uplq p 25 p x 100 2 being p25 the average pressure of 25 of the positions with the lowest pressure kpa p the average pressure of all the tested positions kpa and x the emitter flow exponent which was experimentally determined in the laboratory as 0 03 at the end of the experiment the percentage and location of fully clogged emitters i e emitters that had 0 l h discharge was also determined 2 4 characterization of inlet reclaimed effluent as filter media were tested in different periods and filters could not operate simultaneously as explained in section 3 1 reclaimed effluent parameters at filter inlets table 1 were analyzed to assess if there were differences during the experiment that could have an effect on results significant differences p 0 05 were observed for all the analyzed parameters but they did not mean increased emitter clogging risks according to bucks et al 1979 since ph was between 7 and 8 there was a moderate chemical clogging hazard for all filters and media electrical conductivity ec values showed a moderate chemical hazard capra and scicolone 1998 for all media and filters although they were significantly p 0 05 smaller for the experiments carried out with recycled glass due to changes in the composition of some of the industrial wastewaters treated in the plant turbidity values which are highly related to total suspended solids elbana et al 2012 showed a low physical clogging risk water inlet temperatures were significantly higher p 0 05 during the experiments with recycled glass and may have helped the formation and growth of biofilms which are closely related to emitter clogging zhou et al 2013 dissolved oxygen do was also significantly higher p 0 05 when recycled glass was tested considering that higher temperatures and higher salt content i e ec reduce do do saturation values should be smaller when glass was used instead of sand 8 51 vs 9 02 mg l therefore higher do values observed within the recycled glass experiment would mean that microorganism levels were smaller than when sand was used some isolated water sampling revealed that mesophilic aerobic bacteria determined following the iso 6222 standard iso 1999 at filter outlets were 2 30 105 1 78 105 cfu average standard deviation meaning that the biological clogging risk of the reclaimed effluent was high bucks et al 1979 when both media were tested 2 5 data treatment and statistical analyses statistical analyses carried out using spss statistics software ibm new york usa tukey s pairwise comparison test was used for assessing if averages were significantly different with a probability of 0 05 or less filter performance parameters cycle duration the ratio filtered volume electricity consumption and turbidity and dissolved oxygen removals were assessed using an analysis of the variance anova the model included as fixed effects the filter media and the filter underdrain design as well as their interaction cycle duration was the time elapsed from the end of a backwashing to the beginning of the following one not all the filtration cycles carried out were considered for data treatment specifically those cycles which did not reach a 50 kpa head loss or those for which some recorded data were not valid for the whole cycle e g due to maintenance calibrating processes scaled down sensors lower nominal filtration flow or forced backwashing issues were discarded moreover following duran ros et al 2009b procedure cycles with inefficient backwashing i e those with head loss thresholds across the filter greater than 40 kpa after being backwashed were also not computed for statistical treatment as they cannot release most of the particles retained the total number of cycles included in the statistical analysis are shown in table 1 emitter discharge was also analyzed by means of an anova which in this case included as fixed effects filter media filter underdrain design emitter location and time as well as all the double and triple interactions since some of them were statistically significant p 0 05 in this case the lateral was considered as a covariate a final anova was carried out for assessing the percentage of completely clogged emitters including as fixed effects the filter media and the filter underdrain design and also their interaction 3 results and discussion 3 1 filter performance results of the analysis of variance for the statistical model media type underdrain design and the interaction between the media and underdrain for the filtration cycle duration the ratio between filtered volume and electricity consumption and turbidity and dissolved oxygen removals are shown in table 2 the model was significant p 0 05 for all the cases as it was the interaction between the media material and the underdrain design however the media type by itself was not significant p 0 05 to explain either turbidity removal or the filtered volume per energy consumption the underdrain design alone did not have a significant effect on the cycle duration since the interactions between the media and underdrain design were also significant they will be discussed in this section least square means and their associated standard errors were computed for the different filter performance parameters figs 2 5 because of their greater statistical accuracy in means separation when there are differences in sample size as it was explained in section 2 3 and can be seen in table 1 the number of valid cycles were not the same for each underdrain and media 3 1 1 duration of filtration cycles the interaction between media and filter underdrains for cycle duration is shown in fig 2 filtration cycle duration was not significantly different p 0 05 within the same media using any of the three filter underdrain designs tested however porous media and inserted domes designs showed significantly p 0 05 longer cycles 335 and 330 min on average respectively when recycled glass was used instead of silica sand 203 and 190 min respectively the arm collector design also tended to have longer filtration cycles with glass 257 min although they were not significantly different p 0 05 from those carried out with silica sand 227 min filtration cycle duration was affected by irrigation water quality as well as pressure loss across the filter turbidity and therefore suspended solid load was slightly higher when silica sand was used but the difference was only significant for the inserted domes underdrain however these differences in turbidity averages were not great enough alone maximum of 1 07 ftu table 1 to justify these different cycle durations the average initial pressure loss after a backwashing was slightly higher with glass than with sand at 30 m h for all the filters 22 3 vs 13 6 kpa 14 9 vs 11 9 kpa and 19 9 vs 16 5 kpa for porous underdrain inserted domes and arm collector respectively but reduced at 60 m h 37 2 vs 38 1 kpa 28 5 vs 30 4 kpa and 39 7 vs 40 6 kpa for porous underdrain inserted domes and arm collector respectively pujol et al 2020 found that greater head loss observed with the arm collector underdrain was caused by an imbalance of water flow across each arm this poorer hydraulic performance explains that filtration cycles tended to be shorter with this underdrain since the pressure loss threshold for carrying out backwashing was reached sooner on the other hand the increase of pressure loss across the filtration cycle was quicker with silica sand and therefore filtration cycles carried out with this material were shorter effective grain size d10 was similar between sand 0 48 mm and glass 0 44 mm but the grain uniformity coefficient was greater with sand 1 73 vs 1 59 meaning that d60 was also higher with sand 0 83 mm than with glass 0 70 mm the higher the grain size the lower the head loss across the media filters mesquita et al 2012 conversely greater pressure loss was observed using silica sand compared to recycled glass soyer et al 2010 2013 also observed this behavior which was attributed to the higher porosity of recycled glass because it is more angular this was the case of the materials tested since the porosity of the recycled glass used was 0 54 while that of silica sand was 0 39 thus grain porosity is a key parameter that should be taken into account in addition to other characteristics of granular media which are easier to determine such as effective size d10 3 1 2 filtered volume per energy consumption the average filtered volumes per electrical energy consumption needed to carry out both filtration and backwashing fig 3 were similar for each media being on average 8 30 and 8 09 m3 kwh with sand and glass respectively there were no significant differences p 0 05 among underdrain designs using silica sand but with glass the arm collector showed significantly p 0 05 smaller values 7 65 m3 kwh than porous 8 52 m3 kwh and dome 8 29 m3 kwh underdrains only the arm collector showed significantly different values p 0 05 regarding granular media filtering more volume per energy consumption with sand 8 18 m3 kwh overall porous media underdrain filtered more volume per energy consumption 8 49 m3 kwh than the inserted domes 8 28 m3 kwh and arm collector 7 89 m3 kwh underdrains this result could have been anticipated since the porous underdrain was designed to have a more uniform flow across the bed and therefore it needs less energy bové et al 2017 although reductions are small between 2 5 and 8 little information is available regarding energy consumption for drip irrigation units and specifically for filters but the values observed were higher than those found by soto garcía et al 2013 at farm level 5 26 6 25 m3 kwh and espinosa tasón et al 2020 for irrigation in spain in 2017 5 88 m3 kwh which were both obtained with higher crop area and therefore with greater irrigation water volumes and energy consumption 3 1 3 turbidity removal turbidity removal fig 4 showed a different pattern regarding filter media with recycled glass inserted domes design achieved significantly higher p 0 05 turbidity reductions 25 2 on average than the arm collector 14 9 while porous media 20 5 did not perform differently from the other two underdrain designs using silica sand porous underdrain achieved significantly greater turbidity removals 26 1 than the arm collector 20 4 and in this case with the inserted domes underdrain 15 6 having no differences compared with the other two only inserted domes underdrain performed differently between media since it achieved significantly greater average turbidity removals with glass 25 2 than with sand 20 5 the porous media and the arm collector showed more turbidity removals with sand than with glass but without any statistical difference between both media in all the underdrain designs turbidity removals were 20 7 for sand and 20 2 for recycled glass as the media size was quite close between both media d10 of 0 48 and 0 44 mm for sand and glass respectively no big differences in turbidity removal were expected similar turbidity reductions achieved by recycled glass and sand were also observed by soyer et al 2010 2013 although particle retention is slightly greater with sand rutledge and gagnon 2002 soyer et al 2013 overall turbidity removals have been smaller than those previously obtained 51 1 70 6 with several sand sizes d10 0 33 1 5 mm and different effluents duran ros et al 2009a elbana et al 2012 tripathi et al 2014 the smaller turbidity removal observed in the present experiment 20 5 on average for all of these three underdrain designs may be due to the smaller inlet levels of turbidity of the effluent used 6 65 ftu on average and to the reduced height of sand media bed in the filters which was between 40 and 60 shorter than the heights used by duran ros et al 2009a and elbana et al 2012 with a dome underdrain filter lower media heights used in the present experiment are explained by the limitation caused by the reduced maximum height of the arm collector underdrain filter 40 cm and the need to carry out the experiment under the same experimental conditions of bed height for each filter with lower bed heights there is less chance some filtration mechanisms such as interception diffusion inertia and hydrodynamic action that allow catching particles across the media could act these filtration mechanisms which are depth depending are the most common in media filters cescon and jiang 2020 3 1 4 dissolved oxygen removal dissolved oxygen do increased more at filter outlet 17 7 on average using silica sand than recycled glass 0 05 which had almost no effect on this parameter fig 5 the different underdrain designs only performed statistically different p 0 05 between them when silica sand was used moreover only the inserted domes underdrain design showed significantly p 0 05 higher increases in do with sand 29 8 than with glass media 0 61 considering bed heights and filter flows the residence time of effluent within the media bed was always below 1 min since the filters were closed and pressurized intense contact with air that could easily increase do levels was not possible although maestre valero and martínez álvarez 2010 observed slight do increases in non airy irrigation equipment such as pumps due to some minor imperfections that cause air intrusions according to elbana et al 2012 do recovery depends on the number of backwashings carried out because they reduce organic load in the filter lowering microbial activity and oxygen consumption thus smaller do increases achieved when using recycled glass could be attributed to the overall longer filtration cycles observed with this medium fig 1 which implied that fewer backwashings were performed in addition when glass was used do was significantly p 0 05 higher at filter inlet table 1 which could explain that a lower do decrease could have been achieved moreover chlorination treatment of backwashing water had some breakdowns during the experiments with recycled glass since chlorination reduces microbial population li et al 2010 that consumes oxygen increases in do at the filter outlet could not have been so high the arm collector design was the only one that showed a slight do reduction 0 55 with glass solé torres et al 2019c also observed some do reductions with this design with sand working at higher filtration velocities which might be attributed to the different flow rates between collectors pujol et al 2020 that reduced the contact between the effluent and filtration bed however since differences in turbidity fig 4 were not as affected with this underdrain design further research is needed to identify if there is any different diffusion mechanism on glass surface under the flows and pressures used in this study that might cause such a different performance 3 2 emitter performance average pressure uniformity coefficient uplq for the three irrigation subunits was always above 96 which was the lowest value observed at the end of the experiment with recycled glass the high uplq shows that the pressure distribution across the laterals was very uniform since there were no hydraulic problems that affected the irrigation system performance and the emitter manufacturing coefficient of variation was low 3 emitter discharge reductions were mainly due to emitter clogging emitter discharge values were statistically analyzed and there was table 3 a significant effect p 0 05 caused by three of the fixed factors underdrain design time and emitter location as well as five double interactions media material and time media material and emitter location underdrain design and time underdrain design and emitter location and time and emitter location and two triple interactions media material underdrain design and time and underdrain design time and emitter location although material media was not significant as a single factor p 0 05 it was involved in several of the significant double and triple interactions the significant triple interactions will be analyzed and discussed in the following sections n s not significant p 0 05 p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 3 2 1 effect of the media material underdrain design and irrigation time emitter discharge regarding media material filter underdrain design and irrigation time is shown in fig 6 the effect of time is clear since the discharge of all the tested emitters was reduced by 8 1 after 500 h of operation and by an additional 13 7 after 1000 h overall at the end of the experiment those emitters protected by porous and inserted domes underdrains both reduced their discharge by 22 7 while those that had an arm collector underdrain had 17 2 less flow regarding media material emitter discharge was 18 6 and 19 4 lower after 1000 h when silica sand and recycled glass were used respectively clogging usually worsens with irrigation time because deposited and adhered sediments considerably increase zhang et al 2020 and there is more chance that chemical precipitates or biological growth could affect emitters as it has been widely observed ravina et al 1997 duran ros et al 2009a oliver et al 2014 however emitter clogging is a complex process that also depends on emitter geometric and hydraulic parameters li et al 2019 variations on mineral content zhang et al 2020 as well as on the biofouling kinetics and changes in bacterial communities lequette et al 2020 at the beginning of the experiment 0 h neither the media material nor the filter underdrain had a significant effect p 0 05 on emitter discharge fig 6 once the experiment reached 500 h there was not any difference between the underdrain designs for a given media material only the emitters with a porous underdrain showed an average discharge significantly greater p 0 05 with recycled glass 2 28 l h than with silica sand 2 11 l h at the end of the experiment emitter clogging was more widely spread there were no significant differences between underdrain designs with sand media however emitter discharge with the arm collector underdrain 2 01 l h was significantly higher p 0 05 than that achieved by the porous underdrain 1 81 l h when recycled glass was used the discharge of those emitters protected with dome underdrain using recycled glass as filter bed were not statistically different from that achieved with arm collector and porous media neither arm collector nor inserted domes underdrain performed significantly different between them with glass or sand moreover only porous underdrain significantly p 0 05 caused less emitter discharge using recycled glass than using sand as filtration medium at 1000 h according to these results the porous media underdrain performed somewhat worse with recycled glass although this was only evident at the end of the experiment when more completely clogged emitters appeared as it will be discussed later on in section 3 3 3 2 2 effect of underdrain design emitter location and irrigation time the interaction between filter underdrain design emitter location and irrigation time was also significant table 3 emitter discharge was significantly lower p 0 05 at the end of the lateral in relation to the other locations for porous media underdrain at 500 h and for all the filters at 1000 h fig 7 when different irrigation times were compared fig 8 significant differences p 0 05 only appeared at 66 90 and 100 of the lateral length fig 8 at 66 of the length only the emitter discharge achieved with inserted dome underdrain was significantly lower at 1000 h than before but no differences were observed among underdrains at 90 of the lateral length those emitters protected with porous and inserted dome underdrains had significantly less discharge than those with the collector arm underdrain after 1000 h at this position despite the fact that emitter discharge decline was observed for all underdrains with the arm collector there were no significant differences in emitter discharge measured at the beginning the middle and the end of the experiment it was at the distal location of the dripline when differences were most noticeable after 500 h an almost completely clogged emitter appeared at this position in the laterals protected by the porous underdrain and therefore the emitter discharge at this position was significantly smaller p 0 05 than those of the emitters with the other underdrain designs after 1000 h of irrigation some completely clogged emitters appeared at the end of the lateral thus the emitters placed at the distal end showed a significantly lower p 0 05 discharge than the emitters in any other location whatever the underdrain design was in fact average emitter discharge at the end of the lateral was on average 76 9 less than discharge of those emitters located at the beginning of the dripline at end of the lateral there was not any significant difference p 0 05 for the emitter discharge between the different tested underdrain designs despite slight differences appearing during the experiment once it had finished the different underdrains did not show a differential effect on emitter clogging at any location tested across the lateral the smaller emitter discharge observed at the end of the lateral agreed with previous research ravina et al 1997 trooien et al 2000 duran ros et al 2009a which found increased sediment deposition biological growth and emitter clogging at the end of the driplines 3 3 completely clogged emitters the number of totally clogged emitters was assessed at the end of the experiment fig 9 on average 0 88 of emitters were completely clogged when sand media was used ranging from 0 66 for the arm collector 0 88 for the inserted domes and 1 11 for the porous underdrain using recycled glass the average percentage of totally clogged emitters was higher 2 13 being 1 31 for the inserted domes 1 88 for the arm collector and 3 20 for the porous media underdrain higher temperatures table 1 during the experiment with recycled glass could have promoted microbiological growth and also chemical precipitates oliver et al 2014 that increased emitter clogging an analysis of variance was carried out for assessing if media material underdrain design and their interaction could explain the percentage of completely clogged emitters however neither the factors nor their interaction had a significant effect so the percentage of completely clogged emitters is not affected by underdrain design and the media used all the clogged emitters were located at the end of the lateral which concurs with the results of previous studies trooien et al 2000 oliver et al 2014 pei et al 2014 due to the drip emitter lateral hydraulics there is less flow rate at the end of the laterals shannon et al 1982 and a greater concentration of sediments wu et al 2015 which promote clogging in addition qualitative measurements of chlorine at the emitter outlet at the end of the lateral were made using chlorine test strips and confirmed that the chlorine level was very low at this point since injection was carried out at a long distance away from the filters since chlorine levels between 1 5 and 2 5 mg l were not reached at the end of the laterals li et al 2010 song et al 2017 emitter clogging could not be effectively reduced a possible solution might be specific chlorine treatments applied at the end of laterals but high residual chlorine concentration damages the diaphragm membrane of pressure compensating emitters green et al 2018 and reduces their discharge alternative biocide treatments that avoid this problem such as hydrogen peroxide green et al 2018 could be carried out instead it should also be highlighted that the laterals were not flushed during the experiment with the aim of having more clogging incidence and carrying out the experiment under more unfavorable conditions despite flushing reduces sediment deposition within driplines puig bargués et al 2010b li et al 2018 and biofilm formation oliver et al 2014 li et al 2015 the percentage of completely clogged was relatively small and comparable to that obtained by puig bargués et al 2010a who observed 1 25 of totally clogged emitters after 1620 h working with sand media filter and a similar emitter without carrying out any flushing treatment some completely clogged emitters from the end of the laterals were dissected once the experiment ended biofilm growth was the main cause of clogging without any important visual difference between those emitters that used glass and sand as filter media observations did not differ from those carried out by solé torres et al 2009b with silica sand medium important biofilm growths were observed in some points of the emitter labyrinth as well as near the emitter outlet these emitter areas with low flow velocity enhance the adhesion and deposition of clogging substances on the wall making them more sensitive to biofouling ait mouheb et al 2019 biofilm composition was not analyzed since it was out of the scope of the paper and emitter sampling was carried out under conditions that did not allow representative biofilm results for each treatment 4 conclusions filtration cycles were 132 140 min longer using recycled glass than with silica sand as filter bed with porous and inserted domes underdrains respectively filter runs with sand in the arm collector only lasted 30 min longer the filtered volume per electrical energy consumed during filtration and backwashing was very similar with glass and sand being on average 8 20 m3 kwh this ratio was significantly reduced to 7 65 m3 kwh when the arm collector underdrain was used turbidity removals were around 20 4 and were mainly affected by the underdrain design porous media and inserted domes achieved the highest turbidity removals while the arm underdrain showed the lowest differences between turbidity removals regarding bed materials were only observed with the dome underdrain where recycled glass performed better dissolved oxygen was almost unchanged with recycled glass but was increased by 17 7 by silica sand emitter clogging is a complex process that is affected by the interaction of several factors emitter discharge was reduced by 21 8 after 1000 h of irrigation emitter discharges were not different between underdrains when silica sand was used but with recycled glass those emitters protected by the porous underdrain had a significantly lower discharge than those with the arm collector underdrain emitter clogging was mainly located at the distal end of lateral 90 100 of the dripline length at the end of the experiment recycled glass as the filter bed caused lower emitter discharge and a higher number of completely clogged emitters after 1000 h of irrigation but the differences with silica sand were not statistically significant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9554,pressurized media filters are the most effective means of preventing emitter clogging when reclaimed effluents are used in drip irrigation systems in these filters water pollutants are retained in a granular bed which needs to be replaced once its life span has been reached silica sand is the most common material used as a filtration bed but the use of alternative materials which may improve filtration efficiency and reduce environmental impact should be explored thus the aim of this study was to compare the effect of two different granular media silica sand and recycled glass used in three filters with different underdrain designs collector arms inserted domes and porous media on emitter clogging experiments were carried out by filtering a reclaimed effluent for the duration of 1000 h for each filter and material four irrigation laterals 90 m in length with a 2 3 l h pressure compensating emitter placed every 0 40 m along the dripline were placed after each filter filter performances were continuously assessed while emitter discharges at 8 selected locations across the laterals were measured at the beginning after 500 h and at the end of the experiment filtration cycles lasted longer with recycled glass but turbidity removal was affected by the combination of bed material and underdrain only after 1000 h of irrigation was the discharge significantly lower for those emitters protected with porous underdrain using glass compared with sand emitter discharge was considerably reduced at the end of the lateral due to a higher number of completely clogged emitters at this location but there were not significant differences between granular materials and filter designs overall the results show that using recycled glass does not significantly increase emitter clogging compared with silica sand keywords effluent sustainability clogging microirrigation filtration 1 introduction irrigation with reclaimed effluents instead of fresh water has many potential advantages such as the conservation of potable water resources the use of the nutrients present in the effluent by the crop and a favorable cost benefit ratio trooien and hills 2007 drip irrigation systems are especially suitable for applying reclaimed effluent since effluent exposure to plants and humans is minimized in regard to other irrigation methods such as sprinkler irrigation trooien and hills 2007 although effluents contain many physical and chemical substances as well as microorganisms and their metabolites which can readily clog emitters and affect water distribution uniformity and system operation solé torres et al 2021 continued advances in system design management and monitoring have expanded the use of reclaimed effluents through drip irrigation systems trooien and hills 2007 however preventing emitter clogging is still a challenge that can be tackled by installing suitable emitters trooien et al 2000 zhou et al 2019 filtering the effluent properly and effectively ravina et al 1997 and suppressing microbiological growth and chemical precipitation in the effluent using acidification oxidation and disinfection treatments green et al 2018 hao et al 2018 flushing those accumulated sediments in the driplines puig bargués et al 2010b li et al 2015 and monitoring system performance to assure that partial clogging can be treated before it becomes unrecoverable ravina et al 1997 solé torres et al 2019a are also recommended practices pressurized media filters which have a granular bed placed inside a tank are widely used in drip irrigation systems since they require less surface area than gravity media filters nakayama et al 2007 inorganic and organic particles carried by the irrigation water are trapped throughout the media bed by different and simultaneous mechanisms such as straining sedimentation interception diffusion inertia and hydrodynamic action cescon and jiang 2020 since particles can be caught across the filtration bed and not only on its surface media filters are more efficient in preventing emitter clogging when reclaimed effluents are used compared to other pressurized filters commonly used in drip irrigation systems such as screen and disc filters ravina et al 1997 capra and scicolone 2004 duran ros et al 2009a as the media pores become plugged with pollutants the pressure drop across the filter increases until it is necessary to backwash the granular bed to remove the accumulated contaminants and restore appropriate filtration conditions the removal efficiency achieved by media filters highly relies on backwashing elbana et al 2012 which therefore should be carried out as frequently as possible enciso medina et al 2011 as both filtration and backwashing performance depend on filter design de deus et al 2020 some researchers have been focused on improving the main auxiliary elements of these filters i e diffuser plate mesquita et al 2019 and underdrain pujol et al 2016 2020 aiming to have more uniform water flow across the media and therefore less pressure loss the effect of these changes on filter design and its performance on emitter clogging has not been broadly analyzed recently the study of the effect of different underdrain designs of sand filters on filter performance solé torres et al 2019c and emitter clogging solé torres et al 2019b showed some differences on emitter discharge regarding the underdrain design filter removal efficiency is greatly affected by the physical characteristics of the granular media such as grain size shape and porosity cescon and jian 2020 smaller grain sizes allow higher solid removal elbana et al 2012 wu et al 2015 but head losses are subsequently higher silica sand is the most commonly used medium in pressurized drip irrigation filters nakayama et al 2007 due to its low cost and wide availability other naturally available materials such as anthracite pumice kuslu and sahin 2013 and basalt zaki et al 2021 have also been used in pressurized media filters in gravity filters used for water treatment for urban irrigation or environmental purposes bark activated charcoal dalahmeh et al 2012 lapilli falcón cardona et al 2015 and even some crop wastes ali et al 2016 kaetzl et al 2019 have also been tested the study of new materials that allow higher filter performance lower costs and more energy efficient use is attracting more attention cescon and jiang 2020 in addition since bed media need to be periodically replaced once they reach the end of their life span the use of sustainable materials could facilitate a reduction in the environmental impact bové et al 2018 among these type of materials recycled glass has been investigated as a possible replacement for sand due to its similar physical characteristics cescon and jian 2020 soyer et al 2010 found that recycled glass achieves equivalent turbidity outlet values and lower head loss than sand in pressurized filters nevertheless there is no available information as to if there would be any effect of the use of recycled glass as a filter medium in drip irrigation systems on emitter clogging thus the main objective of this study was to analyze the effect of two different granular media silica sand and recycled glass used in three sand filters with different underdrain designs on emitter clogging when a reclaimed effluent is used 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was carried out at the facilities of the celrà girona spain wastewater treatment plant using the effluent of a sludge process that treats urban and industrial wastewaters three filters with different underdrain designs were used fig 1 the first one model fa f2 188 regaber parets del vallès spain had inserted domes the second one model fa1m lama gelves spain arm collectors and the third one was a prototype with a porous media underdrain bové et al 2017 filled with silica sand sieved to 0 75 0 85 mm grain size further details regarding underdrain characteristics can be found in solé torres et al 2019c after each filter four laterals 90 m in length each with emitters spaced 0 4 m apart were installed all the driplines had the same 2 3 l h rated discharge integrated pressure compensating emitter model uniram as 16010 netafim tel aviv israel with a 3 manufacturing coefficient of variation two different filter media were tested the first one was ca 07ms silica sand sibelco minerales bilbao spain with an effective diameter d10 size opening which passes 10 by dry weight of a representative sample of the filter material of 0 48 mm a uniformity coefficient ratio of the size opening which passes 60 of the sand through the size opening which passes 10 through of 1 73 and a porosity fraction of the volume of voids over the total medium volume which was determined following bové et al 2015 with the ratio between the bulk and real densities experimentally measured of 0 39 the second media was nw2 recycled glass nature works tecnologías l alfàs del pi spain with an effective diameter d10 of 0 44 mm a uniformity coefficient of 1 59 and a porosity of 0 54 a multicellular centrifugal pump model cr 15 4 grundfos bjerringbro denmark governed by a frequency variator model frn 4 fuji electric cerdanyola del vallès spain pumped the reclaimed effluent from the wwtp outlet chamber to the filters a dmed300t2 energy meter lovato electric gorle italy allowed the determination of the electrical energy consumption of the pump the filter inlet flow was measured with an isomag ms2500 isoil industria cinisello balsamo italy electromagnetic flowmeter once filtered the effluent was conveyed to irrigation laterals since the filtrated flow was higher than what was needed for the laterals a proportional electrohydraulic actuator skd32 siemens munich germany operated a three way valve vxg41 siemens munich germany so that the excess flow was carried to a water storage tank of 3000 l aquablock shütz selters germany which was used for filter backwashing a chlorine deposit of 200 l was installed to continuously inject chlorine to achieve a concentration of 2 mg l in the effluent after being filtered using a dostec ac1 2 membrane pump itc santa perpètua de la mogoda spain when sand filters were backwashed chlorine concentration of the backwashing water was increased by up to 4 mg l effluent electrical conductivity ph and temperature were measured at the filter inlet using sensors cls21 c1e4a and cps11d 7ba21 endress hauser gerlingen germany respectively while turbidity and dissolved oxygen were determined at both the filter inlet and outlet with sensors cus31 a2e and cos 61 a1f0 endress hauser gerlingen germany respectively since the experimental facility had only one set of sensors for measuring effluent quality each filter operated individually two additional pressure transducers model tm 01 c step logística y control barcelona spain measured the pressure at the inlet and outlet of each filter all the filters were automatically backwashed when the total pressure drop across them reached 50 kpa backwashing was carried out for 3 min with backwashing water volume determined by a wp dynamic dn 50 sensus raleigh nc usa turbine volume meter with an impulse emitter a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system previously developed duran ros et al 2008 allowed irrigation system operation in addition the scada system recorded data of pump electricity consumption pressure filter inlet flow filtration cycle duration backwashing volume and those quality parameters of the effluent at both the filter inlet and outlet every minute the scada system was programmed to stop irrigation when inlet turbidity was above 50 ftu avoiding operation with high particle loads 2 2 operational procedure each filter and media were tested for 1000 h since this is the media lifespan recommended by the manufacturers experiments with silica sand took place between march and november 2018 with a pause during june due to a breakdown of turbidity sensors recycled glass was tested from june 2019 to march 2020 with several breakdowns due to high turbidity loads caused by operational problems in the treatment plant each filter ran for two daily sessions of 4 h two different media heights 20 and 30 cm and two different filtration velocities 30 and 60 m h were tested during 250 h for each media and underdrain design no lateral flushing was carried out during the experiment 2 3 assessment of filter and emitter performance filter performance for removing turbidity and dissolved oxygen was assessed by computing the removal efficiency e achieved in the filters as e no n no 100 1 being n0 and n turbidity and dissolved oxygen values at filter inlet and outlet respectively at the beginning 0 h middle 500 h and end 1000 h of the experiment flow discharges for two contiguous emitters placed at 0 10 33 40 59 66 90 and 100 of the distances along the lateral length were measured these measurement locations include those suggested by merriam and keller 1978 and juana et al 2007 emitter discharge was collected for 5 min in collection dishes and then transferred to a graduated cylinder to be measured during the emitter discharge measurements pressure was also determined in four locations on each lateral 0 33 66 and 100 of lateral length using a leo 2 digital manometer keller winterhur switzerland with a precision of 0 07 that was placed at a pressure intake ein tal or akiva israel pressure uniformity of pressures uplq bliesner 1976 was calculated as uplq p 25 p x 100 2 being p25 the average pressure of 25 of the positions with the lowest pressure kpa p the average pressure of all the tested positions kpa and x the emitter flow exponent which was experimentally determined in the laboratory as 0 03 at the end of the experiment the percentage and location of fully clogged emitters i e emitters that had 0 l h discharge was also determined 2 4 characterization of inlet reclaimed effluent as filter media were tested in different periods and filters could not operate simultaneously as explained in section 3 1 reclaimed effluent parameters at filter inlets table 1 were analyzed to assess if there were differences during the experiment that could have an effect on results significant differences p 0 05 were observed for all the analyzed parameters but they did not mean increased emitter clogging risks according to bucks et al 1979 since ph was between 7 and 8 there was a moderate chemical clogging hazard for all filters and media electrical conductivity ec values showed a moderate chemical hazard capra and scicolone 1998 for all media and filters although they were significantly p 0 05 smaller for the experiments carried out with recycled glass due to changes in the composition of some of the industrial wastewaters treated in the plant turbidity values which are highly related to total suspended solids elbana et al 2012 showed a low physical clogging risk water inlet temperatures were significantly higher p 0 05 during the experiments with recycled glass and may have helped the formation and growth of biofilms which are closely related to emitter clogging zhou et al 2013 dissolved oxygen do was also significantly higher p 0 05 when recycled glass was tested considering that higher temperatures and higher salt content i e ec reduce do do saturation values should be smaller when glass was used instead of sand 8 51 vs 9 02 mg l therefore higher do values observed within the recycled glass experiment would mean that microorganism levels were smaller than when sand was used some isolated water sampling revealed that mesophilic aerobic bacteria determined following the iso 6222 standard iso 1999 at filter outlets were 2 30 105 1 78 105 cfu average standard deviation meaning that the biological clogging risk of the reclaimed effluent was high bucks et al 1979 when both media were tested 2 5 data treatment and statistical analyses statistical analyses carried out using spss statistics software ibm new york usa tukey s pairwise comparison test was used for assessing if averages were significantly different with a probability of 0 05 or less filter performance parameters cycle duration the ratio filtered volume electricity consumption and turbidity and dissolved oxygen removals were assessed using an analysis of the variance anova the model included as fixed effects the filter media and the filter underdrain design as well as their interaction cycle duration was the time elapsed from the end of a backwashing to the beginning of the following one not all the filtration cycles carried out were considered for data treatment specifically those cycles which did not reach a 50 kpa head loss or those for which some recorded data were not valid for the whole cycle e g due to maintenance calibrating processes scaled down sensors lower nominal filtration flow or forced backwashing issues were discarded moreover following duran ros et al 2009b procedure cycles with inefficient backwashing i e those with head loss thresholds across the filter greater than 40 kpa after being backwashed were also not computed for statistical treatment as they cannot release most of the particles retained the total number of cycles included in the statistical analysis are shown in table 1 emitter discharge was also analyzed by means of an anova which in this case included as fixed effects filter media filter underdrain design emitter location and time as well as all the double and triple interactions since some of them were statistically significant p 0 05 in this case the lateral was considered as a covariate a final anova was carried out for assessing the percentage of completely clogged emitters including as fixed effects the filter media and the filter underdrain design and also their interaction 3 results and discussion 3 1 filter performance results of the analysis of variance for the statistical model media type underdrain design and the interaction between the media and underdrain for the filtration cycle duration the ratio between filtered volume and electricity consumption and turbidity and dissolved oxygen removals are shown in table 2 the model was significant p 0 05 for all the cases as it was the interaction between the media material and the underdrain design however the media type by itself was not significant p 0 05 to explain either turbidity removal or the filtered volume per energy consumption the underdrain design alone did not have a significant effect on the cycle duration since the interactions between the media and underdrain design were also significant they will be discussed in this section least square means and their associated standard errors were computed for the different filter performance parameters figs 2 5 because of their greater statistical accuracy in means separation when there are differences in sample size as it was explained in section 2 3 and can be seen in table 1 the number of valid cycles were not the same for each underdrain and media 3 1 1 duration of filtration cycles the interaction between media and filter underdrains for cycle duration is shown in fig 2 filtration cycle duration was not significantly different p 0 05 within the same media using any of the three filter underdrain designs tested however porous media and inserted domes designs showed significantly p 0 05 longer cycles 335 and 330 min on average respectively when recycled glass was used instead of silica sand 203 and 190 min respectively the arm collector design also tended to have longer filtration cycles with glass 257 min although they were not significantly different p 0 05 from those carried out with silica sand 227 min filtration cycle duration was affected by irrigation water quality as well as pressure loss across the filter turbidity and therefore suspended solid load was slightly higher when silica sand was used but the difference was only significant for the inserted domes underdrain however these differences in turbidity averages were not great enough alone maximum of 1 07 ftu table 1 to justify these different cycle durations the average initial pressure loss after a backwashing was slightly higher with glass than with sand at 30 m h for all the filters 22 3 vs 13 6 kpa 14 9 vs 11 9 kpa and 19 9 vs 16 5 kpa for porous underdrain inserted domes and arm collector respectively but reduced at 60 m h 37 2 vs 38 1 kpa 28 5 vs 30 4 kpa and 39 7 vs 40 6 kpa for porous underdrain inserted domes and arm collector respectively pujol et al 2020 found that greater head loss observed with the arm collector underdrain was caused by an imbalance of water flow across each arm this poorer hydraulic performance explains that filtration cycles tended to be shorter with this underdrain since the pressure loss threshold for carrying out backwashing was reached sooner on the other hand the increase of pressure loss across the filtration cycle was quicker with silica sand and therefore filtration cycles carried out with this material were shorter effective grain size d10 was similar between sand 0 48 mm and glass 0 44 mm but the grain uniformity coefficient was greater with sand 1 73 vs 1 59 meaning that d60 was also higher with sand 0 83 mm than with glass 0 70 mm the higher the grain size the lower the head loss across the media filters mesquita et al 2012 conversely greater pressure loss was observed using silica sand compared to recycled glass soyer et al 2010 2013 also observed this behavior which was attributed to the higher porosity of recycled glass because it is more angular this was the case of the materials tested since the porosity of the recycled glass used was 0 54 while that of silica sand was 0 39 thus grain porosity is a key parameter that should be taken into account in addition to other characteristics of granular media which are easier to determine such as effective size d10 3 1 2 filtered volume per energy consumption the average filtered volumes per electrical energy consumption needed to carry out both filtration and backwashing fig 3 were similar for each media being on average 8 30 and 8 09 m3 kwh with sand and glass respectively there were no significant differences p 0 05 among underdrain designs using silica sand but with glass the arm collector showed significantly p 0 05 smaller values 7 65 m3 kwh than porous 8 52 m3 kwh and dome 8 29 m3 kwh underdrains only the arm collector showed significantly different values p 0 05 regarding granular media filtering more volume per energy consumption with sand 8 18 m3 kwh overall porous media underdrain filtered more volume per energy consumption 8 49 m3 kwh than the inserted domes 8 28 m3 kwh and arm collector 7 89 m3 kwh underdrains this result could have been anticipated since the porous underdrain was designed to have a more uniform flow across the bed and therefore it needs less energy bové et al 2017 although reductions are small between 2 5 and 8 little information is available regarding energy consumption for drip irrigation units and specifically for filters but the values observed were higher than those found by soto garcía et al 2013 at farm level 5 26 6 25 m3 kwh and espinosa tasón et al 2020 for irrigation in spain in 2017 5 88 m3 kwh which were both obtained with higher crop area and therefore with greater irrigation water volumes and energy consumption 3 1 3 turbidity removal turbidity removal fig 4 showed a different pattern regarding filter media with recycled glass inserted domes design achieved significantly higher p 0 05 turbidity reductions 25 2 on average than the arm collector 14 9 while porous media 20 5 did not perform differently from the other two underdrain designs using silica sand porous underdrain achieved significantly greater turbidity removals 26 1 than the arm collector 20 4 and in this case with the inserted domes underdrain 15 6 having no differences compared with the other two only inserted domes underdrain performed differently between media since it achieved significantly greater average turbidity removals with glass 25 2 than with sand 20 5 the porous media and the arm collector showed more turbidity removals with sand than with glass but without any statistical difference between both media in all the underdrain designs turbidity removals were 20 7 for sand and 20 2 for recycled glass as the media size was quite close between both media d10 of 0 48 and 0 44 mm for sand and glass respectively no big differences in turbidity removal were expected similar turbidity reductions achieved by recycled glass and sand were also observed by soyer et al 2010 2013 although particle retention is slightly greater with sand rutledge and gagnon 2002 soyer et al 2013 overall turbidity removals have been smaller than those previously obtained 51 1 70 6 with several sand sizes d10 0 33 1 5 mm and different effluents duran ros et al 2009a elbana et al 2012 tripathi et al 2014 the smaller turbidity removal observed in the present experiment 20 5 on average for all of these three underdrain designs may be due to the smaller inlet levels of turbidity of the effluent used 6 65 ftu on average and to the reduced height of sand media bed in the filters which was between 40 and 60 shorter than the heights used by duran ros et al 2009a and elbana et al 2012 with a dome underdrain filter lower media heights used in the present experiment are explained by the limitation caused by the reduced maximum height of the arm collector underdrain filter 40 cm and the need to carry out the experiment under the same experimental conditions of bed height for each filter with lower bed heights there is less chance some filtration mechanisms such as interception diffusion inertia and hydrodynamic action that allow catching particles across the media could act these filtration mechanisms which are depth depending are the most common in media filters cescon and jiang 2020 3 1 4 dissolved oxygen removal dissolved oxygen do increased more at filter outlet 17 7 on average using silica sand than recycled glass 0 05 which had almost no effect on this parameter fig 5 the different underdrain designs only performed statistically different p 0 05 between them when silica sand was used moreover only the inserted domes underdrain design showed significantly p 0 05 higher increases in do with sand 29 8 than with glass media 0 61 considering bed heights and filter flows the residence time of effluent within the media bed was always below 1 min since the filters were closed and pressurized intense contact with air that could easily increase do levels was not possible although maestre valero and martínez álvarez 2010 observed slight do increases in non airy irrigation equipment such as pumps due to some minor imperfections that cause air intrusions according to elbana et al 2012 do recovery depends on the number of backwashings carried out because they reduce organic load in the filter lowering microbial activity and oxygen consumption thus smaller do increases achieved when using recycled glass could be attributed to the overall longer filtration cycles observed with this medium fig 1 which implied that fewer backwashings were performed in addition when glass was used do was significantly p 0 05 higher at filter inlet table 1 which could explain that a lower do decrease could have been achieved moreover chlorination treatment of backwashing water had some breakdowns during the experiments with recycled glass since chlorination reduces microbial population li et al 2010 that consumes oxygen increases in do at the filter outlet could not have been so high the arm collector design was the only one that showed a slight do reduction 0 55 with glass solé torres et al 2019c also observed some do reductions with this design with sand working at higher filtration velocities which might be attributed to the different flow rates between collectors pujol et al 2020 that reduced the contact between the effluent and filtration bed however since differences in turbidity fig 4 were not as affected with this underdrain design further research is needed to identify if there is any different diffusion mechanism on glass surface under the flows and pressures used in this study that might cause such a different performance 3 2 emitter performance average pressure uniformity coefficient uplq for the three irrigation subunits was always above 96 which was the lowest value observed at the end of the experiment with recycled glass the high uplq shows that the pressure distribution across the laterals was very uniform since there were no hydraulic problems that affected the irrigation system performance and the emitter manufacturing coefficient of variation was low 3 emitter discharge reductions were mainly due to emitter clogging emitter discharge values were statistically analyzed and there was table 3 a significant effect p 0 05 caused by three of the fixed factors underdrain design time and emitter location as well as five double interactions media material and time media material and emitter location underdrain design and time underdrain design and emitter location and time and emitter location and two triple interactions media material underdrain design and time and underdrain design time and emitter location although material media was not significant as a single factor p 0 05 it was involved in several of the significant double and triple interactions the significant triple interactions will be analyzed and discussed in the following sections n s not significant p 0 05 p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 3 2 1 effect of the media material underdrain design and irrigation time emitter discharge regarding media material filter underdrain design and irrigation time is shown in fig 6 the effect of time is clear since the discharge of all the tested emitters was reduced by 8 1 after 500 h of operation and by an additional 13 7 after 1000 h overall at the end of the experiment those emitters protected by porous and inserted domes underdrains both reduced their discharge by 22 7 while those that had an arm collector underdrain had 17 2 less flow regarding media material emitter discharge was 18 6 and 19 4 lower after 1000 h when silica sand and recycled glass were used respectively clogging usually worsens with irrigation time because deposited and adhered sediments considerably increase zhang et al 2020 and there is more chance that chemical precipitates or biological growth could affect emitters as it has been widely observed ravina et al 1997 duran ros et al 2009a oliver et al 2014 however emitter clogging is a complex process that also depends on emitter geometric and hydraulic parameters li et al 2019 variations on mineral content zhang et al 2020 as well as on the biofouling kinetics and changes in bacterial communities lequette et al 2020 at the beginning of the experiment 0 h neither the media material nor the filter underdrain had a significant effect p 0 05 on emitter discharge fig 6 once the experiment reached 500 h there was not any difference between the underdrain designs for a given media material only the emitters with a porous underdrain showed an average discharge significantly greater p 0 05 with recycled glass 2 28 l h than with silica sand 2 11 l h at the end of the experiment emitter clogging was more widely spread there were no significant differences between underdrain designs with sand media however emitter discharge with the arm collector underdrain 2 01 l h was significantly higher p 0 05 than that achieved by the porous underdrain 1 81 l h when recycled glass was used the discharge of those emitters protected with dome underdrain using recycled glass as filter bed were not statistically different from that achieved with arm collector and porous media neither arm collector nor inserted domes underdrain performed significantly different between them with glass or sand moreover only porous underdrain significantly p 0 05 caused less emitter discharge using recycled glass than using sand as filtration medium at 1000 h according to these results the porous media underdrain performed somewhat worse with recycled glass although this was only evident at the end of the experiment when more completely clogged emitters appeared as it will be discussed later on in section 3 3 3 2 2 effect of underdrain design emitter location and irrigation time the interaction between filter underdrain design emitter location and irrigation time was also significant table 3 emitter discharge was significantly lower p 0 05 at the end of the lateral in relation to the other locations for porous media underdrain at 500 h and for all the filters at 1000 h fig 7 when different irrigation times were compared fig 8 significant differences p 0 05 only appeared at 66 90 and 100 of the lateral length fig 8 at 66 of the length only the emitter discharge achieved with inserted dome underdrain was significantly lower at 1000 h than before but no differences were observed among underdrains at 90 of the lateral length those emitters protected with porous and inserted dome underdrains had significantly less discharge than those with the collector arm underdrain after 1000 h at this position despite the fact that emitter discharge decline was observed for all underdrains with the arm collector there were no significant differences in emitter discharge measured at the beginning the middle and the end of the experiment it was at the distal location of the dripline when differences were most noticeable after 500 h an almost completely clogged emitter appeared at this position in the laterals protected by the porous underdrain and therefore the emitter discharge at this position was significantly smaller p 0 05 than those of the emitters with the other underdrain designs after 1000 h of irrigation some completely clogged emitters appeared at the end of the lateral thus the emitters placed at the distal end showed a significantly lower p 0 05 discharge than the emitters in any other location whatever the underdrain design was in fact average emitter discharge at the end of the lateral was on average 76 9 less than discharge of those emitters located at the beginning of the dripline at end of the lateral there was not any significant difference p 0 05 for the emitter discharge between the different tested underdrain designs despite slight differences appearing during the experiment once it had finished the different underdrains did not show a differential effect on emitter clogging at any location tested across the lateral the smaller emitter discharge observed at the end of the lateral agreed with previous research ravina et al 1997 trooien et al 2000 duran ros et al 2009a which found increased sediment deposition biological growth and emitter clogging at the end of the driplines 3 3 completely clogged emitters the number of totally clogged emitters was assessed at the end of the experiment fig 9 on average 0 88 of emitters were completely clogged when sand media was used ranging from 0 66 for the arm collector 0 88 for the inserted domes and 1 11 for the porous underdrain using recycled glass the average percentage of totally clogged emitters was higher 2 13 being 1 31 for the inserted domes 1 88 for the arm collector and 3 20 for the porous media underdrain higher temperatures table 1 during the experiment with recycled glass could have promoted microbiological growth and also chemical precipitates oliver et al 2014 that increased emitter clogging an analysis of variance was carried out for assessing if media material underdrain design and their interaction could explain the percentage of completely clogged emitters however neither the factors nor their interaction had a significant effect so the percentage of completely clogged emitters is not affected by underdrain design and the media used all the clogged emitters were located at the end of the lateral which concurs with the results of previous studies trooien et al 2000 oliver et al 2014 pei et al 2014 due to the drip emitter lateral hydraulics there is less flow rate at the end of the laterals shannon et al 1982 and a greater concentration of sediments wu et al 2015 which promote clogging in addition qualitative measurements of chlorine at the emitter outlet at the end of the lateral were made using chlorine test strips and confirmed that the chlorine level was very low at this point since injection was carried out at a long distance away from the filters since chlorine levels between 1 5 and 2 5 mg l were not reached at the end of the laterals li et al 2010 song et al 2017 emitter clogging could not be effectively reduced a possible solution might be specific chlorine treatments applied at the end of laterals but high residual chlorine concentration damages the diaphragm membrane of pressure compensating emitters green et al 2018 and reduces their discharge alternative biocide treatments that avoid this problem such as hydrogen peroxide green et al 2018 could be carried out instead it should also be highlighted that the laterals were not flushed during the experiment with the aim of having more clogging incidence and carrying out the experiment under more unfavorable conditions despite flushing reduces sediment deposition within driplines puig bargués et al 2010b li et al 2018 and biofilm formation oliver et al 2014 li et al 2015 the percentage of completely clogged was relatively small and comparable to that obtained by puig bargués et al 2010a who observed 1 25 of totally clogged emitters after 1620 h working with sand media filter and a similar emitter without carrying out any flushing treatment some completely clogged emitters from the end of the laterals were dissected once the experiment ended biofilm growth was the main cause of clogging without any important visual difference between those emitters that used glass and sand as filter media observations did not differ from those carried out by solé torres et al 2009b with silica sand medium important biofilm growths were observed in some points of the emitter labyrinth as well as near the emitter outlet these emitter areas with low flow velocity enhance the adhesion and deposition of clogging substances on the wall making them more sensitive to biofouling ait mouheb et al 2019 biofilm composition was not analyzed since it was out of the scope of the paper and emitter sampling was carried out under conditions that did not allow representative biofilm results for each treatment 4 conclusions filtration cycles were 132 140 min longer using recycled glass than with silica sand as filter bed with porous and inserted domes underdrains respectively filter runs with sand in the arm collector only lasted 30 min longer the filtered volume per electrical energy consumed during filtration and backwashing was very similar with glass and sand being on average 8 20 m3 kwh this ratio was significantly reduced to 7 65 m3 kwh when the arm collector underdrain was used turbidity removals were around 20 4 and were mainly affected by the underdrain design porous media and inserted domes achieved the highest turbidity removals while the arm underdrain showed the lowest differences between turbidity removals regarding bed materials were only observed with the dome underdrain where recycled glass performed better dissolved oxygen was almost unchanged with recycled glass but was increased by 17 7 by silica sand emitter clogging is a complex process that is affected by the interaction of several factors emitter discharge was reduced by 21 8 after 1000 h of irrigation emitter discharges were not different between underdrains when silica sand was used but with recycled glass those emitters protected by the porous underdrain had a significantly lower discharge than those with the arm collector underdrain emitter clogging was mainly located at the distal end of lateral 90 100 of the dripline length at the end of the experiment recycled glass as the filter bed caused lower emitter discharge and a higher number of completely clogged emitters after 1000 h of irrigation but the differences with silica sand were not statistically significant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
