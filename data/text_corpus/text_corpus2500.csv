indicator of hch degradation was measured to confirm the process during the initial sludge acclimatization only 49 23 degradation efficiency was seen after 45 days with an initial concentration of 1 0 g l 1 however when electron donors and co substrates were added to the sludge the degradation time was shortened to 15 days with an increase in efficiency up to 60 17 when this adapted sludge was taken in a uasb reactor start up at 100 mg l 1 hch this degradation effectiveness was significantly improved when organic loading rate olr was decreased to 50 mg l 1 d 1 assuming 48 h hydraulic

abstract unlabelled image keywords t hexachlorocyclohexane hch isomers lindane persistent organic pollutant acclimatization uasb reactor start up data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction technical hexachlorocyclohexane t hch is a broad spectrum organochlorine pesticide which has caused severe global environmental contamination due to its indiscriminate disposal it is applied as a technical mixture comprising α hch β hch γ hch δhch hch stereo isomers occurring in varying concentrations such as 60 70 5 12 10 12 6 10 and 2 3 respectively 1 however only the gamma isomer is termed as lindane which essentially carries the insecticidal property it has been applied and used as the purified form in many developed countries 2 however the production of lindane from technical hch involves several purification steps which add to its cost consequently in developing countries like india it is used as a technical mixture since 1 0 t of lindane manufacturing produces around nine tonnes of other waste muck comprising complex mixture of other isomers serious contamination is caused due to open stockpiles of t hch in the environment 3 based on this production rate it is estimated that around 4 8 million tonnes of hch waste residue exists across the globe for the global elimination of this pesticide the persistent organic pollutant pop review committee poprc registered lindane as a persistent organic pollutant pop in annexure a of the stockholm convention 2009 along with two other isomers that is α hch and β hch 1 therefore researchers are working on the remediation of this pop among several physical and chemical treatments biological treatment has been gaining attention due to its cost effectiveness and eco friendly nature 4 the heavily chlorinated aspect of hch makes it an electron deficient entity consequently it can function as a terminal electron acceptor in a biological process by undergoing reductive dechlorination in an anaerobic system when supplied with a suitable electron donor since the removal of the chlorine atom is to be accomplished via reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions the degradation of lindane is essentially presumed to be an anaerobic process however both aerobic and anaerobic routes of lindane biodegradation have been elucidated although its entire degrading process has been identified in sphingomonas paucimobilis ut26 under aerobic conditions 5 the process is very slow and other aerobic microbes often fail in metabolizing the hch completely apart from the microbial degradation of lindane in pure or mixed cultures 6 9 certain anaerobic studies have used sewage sludge to review the same 10 12 to degrade 100 mg l 1 of t hch 500 mg l 1 methanol was used as an electron donor this concentration was found optimum for the dechlorination of hch in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket bioreactor uasb 12 maximum transformation of the β hch with sucrose as its substrate was observed in uasb reactors using three different substrates that is volatile fatty acids vfas methanol and sucrose 13 similarly higher degradation of β hch along with δ hch was achieved by using starch as a co substrate against a combination of acetic acid propionic acid and butyric in 4 1 1 ratio 10 using an anaerobic sludge in liquid slurry systems alpha and gamma isomers degraded after 30 days while beta and delta isomer degraded after 120 days 14 the deployment of bioreactor systems as a cleanup technology is an appealing choice for pollutant decomposition because optimizing the bioremediation process makes managing the process parameters simple hch being a strongly chlorinated pollutant during its degradation processes creates noxious intermediates such as pentachlorocyclohexene that are far more toxic than the primary chemical itself ex situ remediation methods such as the use of bioreactor devices are recommended in these cases most studies using bioreactor systems have examined the degradation of 50 mg l 1 or less hch 15 17 reports that have described anaerobic hch degradation in bioreactor systems like uasb using sewage sludge with higher hch concentration remain scant 18 for recalcitrant compounds like pops a considerable period of acclimatization is required to achieve biological treatment of the target compound the acclimatization process introduces new degrading species by exerting selective pressure over the biological community of the sludge through the induction of the dechlorinating enzymes this process has practical applications especially for the chemical industry such as treating recalcitrant compounds hence it becomes an important aspect prior to the anaerobic degradation processes at the reactor level 19 23 testing the effectiveness of degradation studies in labs elucidating the mechanisms through complex systems for their subsequent implementation ensures the effectiveness of any environmental biotechnology approach 24 1 1 significance of the study although there are many studies that deal with the anaerobic degradation of hch studies which examine the factors that influence the start up of reactor with the acclimatized sludge remain scant thus this study focuses on the degradation of t hch which is the main substrate at a high concentration in a batch mode using anaerobic sludge employing glucose as a co substrate as well as electron donor it investigates the degradation achieved along with a co relation between different parameters these parameters include co substrate organic carbon content ph and elemental composition of the sludge which are affected during the degradation process the acclimatized sludge was used to run a full scale uasb reactor for actual continuous studies however the aim of this paper is to present the dynamics of sludge adaptation during the degradation process in the context of the above mentioned parameters which will ultimately influence the initial reactor start up consequently reactor studies are not the main focus of this paper this study provides useful start up data which can be beneficial before venturing into the degradation of such persistent organic compound like hch in bioreactors in many of the research work reported above direct reactor studies are mentioned using the sludge for the degradation of hch or other recalcitrant compounds also very low concentration of hch was employed for many of the reactor studies reported till date none of the studies to the best of author s knowledge describes the dynamics of the sludge adaptation and how the parameters influence the start up of uasb hence this study can provide useful insight on the reactor start up dynamics for the researchers in the field these initial sludge adaptation and start up studies can prove beneficial before venturing into the degradation of pops utilising reactor systems uasb in particular the work s novelty hence stems from the useful insights discovered during sludge acclimatization which have practical uses for the chemical industry in terms of handling recalcitrant substances like hch via a biotechnological pathway the manuscript includes helpful start up data for treating hexachlorocyclohexane isomers in a reactor setup to the best of the author s understanding this is the first research to suggest reactor start up data for this contaminant s treatment full scale successful and cost effective on site remediation of the lindane polluted site is a major challenge because there is no robust technology for the onsite treatment of hch 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals technical hexachlorocyclohexane t hch was obtained from m s kanoria chemicals renukoot sonbhadra district in uttar pradesh india with the following compositions of α β γ and δ isomers 68 9 6 9 16 6 and 7 6 respectively stock solution of t hch was prepared in n hexane acetone 80 20 the analytical grade n hexane acetone methanol glucose from merck india ltd mumbai india were also used 2 2 seed preparation for reactor start up the seed inoculum used in the batch experiments comprised partially digested cow dung and sludge from a reactor engaged in the wastewater treatment at a food processing industry nagpur in a 50 50 v v ratio the initial biomass concentration of the sludge was 67 g l 1 volatile suspended solid vss and a specific methanogenic activity sma of 0 32 g chemical oxygen demand cod ch4 g vss 1 d 1 the sludge was stored at 4 c and washed two to three times with distilled water to remove residual soluble matter before using it in experiments 10 the mineral salt media comprised in mg l 1 k2hpo4 25 kh2po4 32 and nh4 2hpo4 132 with trace elements 1 ml l 1 the trace element solution contained g l 1 10 mnso4 7h2o 3 mncl2 h2o 1 cocl2 6h2o 2 nicl2 6h2o 2 na2moo4 6h2o 30 h3bo3 and 1 cucl2 medium ph was set at 7 4 0 3 with 0 1 n naoh or 0 2 n h2so4 glucose was used as the co substrate and t hch as the main substrate was used in a liquid medium after dissolving it in 80 20 n hexane and acetone mixture 2 3 design of uasb reactor for the degradation studies an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb was designed to examine the degradation of hch isomers in batch mode using the acclimatized sludge fig s1 a tubular perplexes reactor 50 8 cm in height with a gross volume of 4 5 l and working volume of 3 5 to 4 l was fabricated six sampling ports were installed in the reactor at equidistance 13 cm the upper side of the reactor was connected to a liquid displacement as a gas outlet and the bottom of the reactor was connected to a peristaltic pump for facilitating hch seed inlet 2 4 anaerobic degradation of t hch the sludge was acclimatized in a 5 l aspirator bottle with 1 0 g l 1 t hch concentration in a batch mode operation with 0 5 g l 1 glucose as the co substrate fig 1 the bottle was tightly capped with a rubber stopper and incubated at 37 c and ph 7 0 and constantly mixed by keeping it on a magnetic stirrer initial seed acclimation was performed in a 5 l aspirator bottle in order to provide proper mixing conditions by keeping it on constant mixing with magnetic stirring since the seed consisted of partially digested cow dung and anaerobic sludge in 50 50 volume by volume ratio the mixture initially was very heterogeneous also the uasb does not have any mixing provision so the sludge was initially subjected to vigorous acclamation to ensure the proper mixing of the substrate hch with the msm and the seed sludge the acclimatization studies were carried using this sludge which was further taken for uasb start up studies at day 0 only 1 0 g l 1 t hch concentration was added after one week to this 0 5 g l 1 of glucose was added as the co substrate in the second and third week without any addition of the t hch and glucose addition which was completely stopped in the fourth week samples were extracted daily for ph evaluation total organic carbon toc carbon hydrogen nitrogen sulphur chns free chloride ion release total suspended solids tss and vss to monitor the t hch degradation during the course of the experiment samples were initially withdrawn and analyzed for the presence of chlorides only to monitor the degradation however the routine analysis of other parameters was performed regularly after 50 days when removal efficiency reached a near constant highest value glucose was added again the concentration of the co substrate was 0 5 g l 1 at each addition the gas outlet was attached to an alkaline liquid displacement for the measurement of methane production 2 5 analytical methods total organic carbon toc and elemental composition in terms of carbon hydrogen nitrogen sulphur chns were analyzed using toc analyser v cph total organic carbon analyser shimadzu and chns analyser vario micro elementar respectively tss vss and chlorides by argentometric method were measured as per the standard methods apha 25 the presence of chlorides was observed since day one however other parameters were continuously monitored after 50 days for a month and then intermittently to examine the change corresponding with the degradation percentage the degradation percentage was based on the dechlorination percentage thus these terms are used interchangeably throughout the paper 2 6 extraction gc ecd and gc ms analysis the sample extraction method was modified slightly as per 14 by adding 3 ml of sludge to 6 ml of 80 20 n hexane acetone in the 15 ml falcon tube this concoction was vortexed for 10 min to ensure proper mixing this was followed by subjecting the sample to centrifuge at 2500 rpm for 10 min to transfer hch and residues to the organic phase from the slurry the organic phase was further refined by letting it pass via a silica gel column made of three layers of activated silica gel wedged between anhydrous sodium sulphate the washing aliquots were concentrated in a rotary evaporator before being run in gc ecd at appropriate dilutions following that the quantity of t hch in the sample was determined using a gas chromatograph model clarus 690 perkin elmer usa equipped with a 63ni electron capture detector we used a db 5 column 30 m long with an interior thickness of 0 25 mm and 0 25 m film the injector furnace and detection temperatures were kept at 280 c 180 c and 280 c respectively with a split ratio of 1 2 the transport gas was nitrogen with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 after degradation hch residues and intermediates were analyzed in a varian 450 gc coupled with an ms 240 separation was performed using a db 5 ms column 30 m in length 0 25 mm id and 0 25 μm film thickness the temperature of the oven was set to rise from 60 c with a 1 min hold to 170 c at a rate of 40 c min and then to 310 c at a rate of 10 c min with a 3 min hold 1 μl of sample was injected into the gc with the injector temperature adjusted to 280 c the ion trap was elevated to 200 degrees celsius and the acquiring mass ranged from 50 to 600 da as well as the fragmentation pattern were noted the retention time of α hch was 7 89 min β hch 8 23 min γ hch 8 34 min and δ hch 8 9 min respectively using external reference calibration hch isomers were measured in the range of 0 1 to 20 mg l 1 the recovery of hch isomers was 80 2 7 reactor start up and operation the treated seed 3 l 15 g l 1 ts was fed into the uasb reactor and operated in batch mode to examine the sludge s efficiency for hch degradation initially 50 mg l 1 concentration of t hch and 500 mg l 1 concentration of glucose were introduced into the reactor degradation was examined as a measure of chloride release after achieving constant degradation percentage t hch concentration was gradually increased to 100 mg l 1 by gradually incrementing the hch concentration from 50 mg l 1 to 70 90 mg l 1 and ultimately 100 mg l 1 with a constant glucose concentration 2 8 gas analysis the existence of biogas was quantitatively considered by the alkaline displacement method the outlet of the gas was connected with the liquid displacement assembly as shown in the diagram the qualitative assessment for quantifying ch4 was however performed on gc tcd thermal conductivity detector attached to a porapack q packed column the operating temperatures of the detector and injector were each 100 c respectively oven was kept at 50 c for the duration of the 2 min run the flow rate was kept at 25 ml min 3 results 3 1 degradation studies during sludge acclimatization the batch degradation studies were carried out in a 5 l aspirator bottle with an initial 1 0 g l 1 t hch concentration for the acclimatization of the sludge it was observed there was a lag phase of about 5 days with dechlorination of t hch only about 15 20 was observed at the initial hch concentration afterwards it was seen that 49 23 degradation was achieved in terms of dechlorination in 44 days however this time was gradually reduced to 17 days with an increase in degradation percentage upto 60 17 after addition of t hch again from the 48th day subsequent to addition of another dose of t hch a gradual increase in the dechlorination percentage was observed reaching up to an average of 56 07 over a period of eight days the chloride release was slow and unstable and reached up to 60 17 within 22 days of the feed switch the duration of degradation was further reduced to 10 days indicating the biomass adaptation to t hch fig 1 the maximum removal efficiency plateau indicates the presence of sufficient microbial population necessary to sustain and progress anaerobic digestion stably during the acclimatization process various parameters were also analyzed to assess the relationship between them and the degradation percentage thus the degradation was monitored during the batch process to check for the reduction of t hch in terms of chloride release as a measure of t hch degradation in the batch studies degradation of t hch 1 g l 1 upto 60 17 after 14 days was observed this degradation percentage increased to 91 63 when hrt was further increased to 15 days increasing the duration to four more weeks resulted in however only 9 more degradation 3 1 1 co substrate addition volatile suspended solids vss was examined as a measure of active biomass during the degradation since t hch is not a growth enhancing substrate the sludge had to be subjected to a suitable co substrate to sustain the growth of bacterial biomass glucose was chosen as an appropriate co substrate because it is a ubiquitous electron donor that can aid in the reductive dechlorination process as well as microbial development as can be seen from the graph fig 2 after day 55 the bacterial biomass increased with every addition of the co substrate this corresponded with the increasing release of chloride indicating degradation this was initially observed after day 7 after one week and day 14 after two weeks wherein the slight addition of glucose resulted in the rise of the degradation percentage further increase in the removal efficiency from 47 86 to 58 81 was observed on day 66 after the addition of the co substrate on day 55 after this only the co substrate was added to the mixture no specific trend was observed during upto day 93 after which again the degradation percentage remained constant for a long period at 55 95 when the chlorides remained constant over a large period of time t hch addition was done again at day 174 this is an important aspect in the acclimatization process because it indicates that the biomass utilized the target compound and adjusted to it releasing chloride further addition of the co substrate activated the biomass and increased the release of chloride this trend was clearly observed in batches where the sludge was introduced with co substrates at various intervals that is days 55 69 and 87 the results indicated that the external carbon source which was used as a co substrate not only reduced the lag period for degradation but also enhanced the dechlorination rate from 48 to 60 fig 2 different co substrates have been tried and tested for the degradation of hch in a similar study dealing with the degradation of hch 500 mg l 1 optimum concentration of methanol was employed as an electron donor and a co substrate to degrade 100 mg l 1 of t hch in a uasb 12 similarly anaerobic slurry reactor was utilized for the degradation of hch isomers it was observed that the degradation rates for β and δ hch were high when starch was used as the substrate against vfas like acetic propionic and butyric acid in 4 1 1 ratio 10 on the other hand 26 noticed the promotion of γ hch dechlorination under anaerobic circumstances in the presence of several co substrates with glucose being the most active stimulator 27 demonstrated the opposing impacts of acetate on the breakdown of γ and β hch by pseudomonas sp acetate accelerated the decomposition of α hch while significantly decelerating the degradation of γ hch whereas some studies reported that the activated sludge required as long as four weeks to adjust to metabolise different aromatic substances 28 another study reported that the response of activated sediment to sorbitol took only three days 29 such high lag times during the acclimation of sludge with the recalcitrant compounds are often reported as the time required to achieve complete acclimation of an activated sludge system is highly contingent on the intricacy of the substrate examined 30 3 1 2 total organic carbon organic carbon oc is an important parameter in the acclimatization process because different metabolic processes affect the carbon balance during the degradation mechanism if soluble carbon is taken up by the cell then the active biomass increases however soluble carbon can decrease when carbon fractions are transformed into carbon dioxide or methane 31 throughout the process oc decreased from 2582 mg l 1 to 927 mg l 1 fig 3 fluctuation in the amount of toc 500 9000 mg l 1 was observed during the acculturation of the microbial community that treated the table olive processing wastewater however almost 90 toc removal was achieved using the acclimatized biomass in the membrane bioreactor system 32 nevertheless the percentage of carbon signifying elemental carbon content trend remained constant throughout the acclimatization process fig s2 a study on the elementary composition of dry compost sewage sludge using chns did not report great variation in the contents of carbon hydrogen nitrogen and sulfur during the acclimatization period 33 while there were no significant differences in the elemental composition of the sludge during the maturation process other parameters like toc ph and biomass changed significantly 3 1 3 ph during the sludge acclimation ph dropped to 6 4 from 7 however ph during the anaerobic degradation throughout remained between 7 0 3 fig s3 this could be explained by the formation of vfas and their probable further conversion into methane gas showing that the anaerobic digestion was progressing well in the batch process 31 this could be ascertained by quantifying the methane gas produced biogas production was confirmed by quantifying the gas via the alkaline displacement assuring the functioning of anaerobic digestion throughout the acclimatization process a clear trend or correlation between biogas production and degradation percentage was not observed in one of such studies irregular patterns of biogas production without any correlation with cod removal rate were also observed during acclimatization of the microbial biomass to the sequential addition of substrates in the uasb reactor 21 this could be because of the uncertainty of measurement due to the possible negative pressure developed or clogging issues which in turn was caused by the utilization of oxygen by the facultative anaerobic bacteria this could be due to a process flaw or a technical mistake during the original setup 21 3 1 4 temperature temperature is conducive for sustaining the microorganisms and various metabolic activities associated with them anaerobic activity can take place relatively high at mesophilic temperature of 35 c exhibiting maximum specific methanogenic activity at this temperature however an increase in biomass or high hydraulic retention time is required to achieve the similar methanogenic activity at temperatures other than 35 c 34 hch degradation was studied and observed during the whole degradation period at different temperature ranges degradation time of hch isomers with the intermittent co substrate addition ranged from three weeks to six months and was not associated with complete t hch degradation after this batch of degradation t hch was not added because complete degradation was not achieved thus only the co substrate was added this is evident from the graph no specific trend was seen after the 69th day however for every addition of the co substrate the main substrate must also be added to ensure efficient degradation this irregular chloride trend can also be attributed to the methanogenic activity which could have been affected due to the temperature variations when the average temperature fell below 25 c since the anaerobic degradation processes are conducive to the mesophilic temperature range of 30 40 c the degradation was effective and efficient during the initial three months june july and august and february when the temperature was between 30 and 35 c fig s4 temperature of 30 c is found to be suitable for hch degradation by anaerobic slurry cultures in an anaerobic bioreactor 14 35 similarly a slurry batch bioreactor employing single culture of bjerkandera adusta could significantly degrade different isomers at 30 c 36 the optimal temperature for hch degradation is found to be between 25 and 30 c in bacterial cultures soil as well as soil slurry mesophilic temperature was found to be the most favourable condition for alpha hch degradation with an optimum temperature of 30 c 37 whereas around 65 lindane removal was also observed in a slurry reactor operating at 37 c 38 temperature of around 25 30 c in slurry bioreactors have been reported to perform well at lower ambient temperature as well 39 hch degradation at extreme temperatures have not been reported and also some studies have shown that temperature is an insignificant factor in alpha hch degradation 40 it should also be noted that in anaerobic bioreactors methanogenesis takes place therefore any change of temperature beyond the mesophilic range can negatively hamper the methane generation due to the inactivation of mesophilic granular sludge 41 3 1 5 active biomass fig 2 depicts the microbial status of the sludge during batch mode with 1 g l 1 concentration of t hch in the acclimatization it should be noted here that sometimes the estimation of total active biomass does not correctly estimate biodegradation rate because it largely depends on the homogeneous collection of samples from the system it is often implied that the biomass concentration should be concomitant with the substrate concentration and degradation because the substrate is utilized by the biomass to produce energy for the growth and maintenance of cells however this is not the case in practical situations the inhibition effects due to high substrate concentration and accumulation of toxic intermediates could explain the fluctuations or low biomass concentrations during specific intervals 42 this study reports similar observations however the active biomass in terms of vss denotes that the bio community started degrading hch and multiplying thereby increasing the biomass 32 the existence of organic matter and other readily utilisable chemical compounds is another significant element that may influence the biodegradability of any toxic substance in the natural environment acetone was found to marginally increase α hch degradation while benzoate and ethanol retarded degradation resulting in delayed cl release when using an unacclimated consortium glucose at greater concentrations suppressed the degradation rate whereas the impact was not as evident when using an acclimated consortium when the co substrate is used as a favored growing substrate retardation can occur 37 these evidences can further explain the possible fluctuations in active biomass probably due to this phenomenon the preferred use of acetate as a growth substrate was believed to explain the delayed degradation of γ hch in an acetate added medium 43 the identical scenario could have unfolded in this instance as the unacclimated consortium was initially used and it almost took 45 days to achieve 49 23 degradation efficiency fig 1 however when the consortium was repeatedly exposed to t hch the microbes may have lost their ability to use glucose effectively as a growth substrate resulting in improved utilization of t hch even in the presence of glucose this is demonstrated by the fact that the enhanced growth caused by glucose is not as noticeable in the acclimated consortium as it is in the unacclimated one 37 this can also explain the lag time which got reduced from 45 days to 22 days and further down to 17 days as the active biomass was getting acclimated to the hch 3 1 6 statistical analysis of data data on t hch degradation during the start up experiment were analyzed by correlation and multiple regression method using ibm spss software version 26 correlation and regression were used to calculate the degradation percentage chloride release keeping the number of days as the independent variable was examined was done separately because it was calculated right from the first day table 1a however for other parameters the analysis was conducted after 50 days for approximately a month it was observed that the number of days was positively correlated with degradation percentage chlorides active biomass in terms of vss and carbon percentage and negatively correlated with total carbon and ph this implies that the concentration of chloride vss and carbon percentage increased during the acclimatization period there is a significant positive relationship between days and other correlation parameters such as chloride degradation total organic carbon percent carbon and ph r 26 0 90 also p 0 005 confirms the statistical significance of the data table 1b 3 2 degradation in the uasb reactor with the acclimatized sludge parameters factors examined in association with the degradation process using the seed inoculum section 2 7 were taken into consideration to determine what influences reactor start up the influent containing the msm with 100 mg l 1 t hch were fed into the uasb reactor from the bottom inlet port with the aid of the peristaltic pump and various parameters were studied during the degradation process routine analysis of the parameters such as ph tss vss chlorides release and degradation percentage was conducted in the batch mode the average monthly estimates of the parameters studied are represented in table 2 the amount of total solids ts during reactor startup was 15 g l 1 which increased to 27 g ts l 1 with an average vs ts ratio of 0 85 the hydraulic retention time hrt was observed as a key parameter that indicates the average residence time of the compound that remains in the bioreactor 44 it is usually expressed as the ratio of the volume of reactor to the flow rate and often expressed in days or hours t hch in uasb reactor was dechlorinated with upto 90 degradation with a 48 h hrt when the hrt was cut to 24 or 36 h there was insufficient dechlorination while increasing the hrt to 60 h did not show any enhanced degradation an optimum hrt ensures the proper degradation of compound along with maintaining sufficient biomass also organic loading rates olrs are related to hrt longer hrts often result in biomass accumulation while shorter hrts result in them being washed out 45 besides hrt olr also plays a significant role in efficiently degrading the compound which is measured by the amount of organic material added per m3 of the reactor volume per day the performance of the reactor is greatly influenced with the simultaneous increase in olr however beyond a certain point it can be unfavorable for the reactor s performance 46 carbon balances between the influent and effluent samples liquid as well as gaseous showed predicted gas volume of approximately 300 ml where 45 of the total gas comprised of ch4 while approximately 50 consisted of co2 5 unidentified gases the observed values showed 270 ml of gas production corresponding to 0 260 g mol and 0 795 g mol of ch4 and co2 as against predicted values of 0 309 g mol and 0 897 g mol ch4 and co2 respectively s1 another batch of the reactor was operated with lesser hch concentration by gradually increasing t hch concentration from 50 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 over 60 days with media recirculation through peristaltic pump initially the time required by the reactor to achieve 90 13 degradation of 100 mg l 1 t hch was 28 days which was reduced to five days and ultimately to two days achieving upto 90 13 t hch degradation fig s4 the degradation profiles of the four isomers examined using gc ms reported 92 37 90 64 85 72 and 83 26 degradation of α γ β and δ hch respectively the α and γ hch isomers displayed better degradation results compared to the β and δ isomers since the initial hch concentration was quite high complete degradation was not observed the appearance of pentachlorocyclohexene pcch as a transient intermediate was also observed which eventually disappeared or possibly transformed into other by products during the degradation process fig 4 studies by 47 48 observed the transitory formation of pcch from hch under anaerobic conditions formation of pcch and tetrachlorocyclohexene tcch from hch further 1 2 dichlorobenzene 1 2 dcb and 1 3 dichlorobenzene 1 3 dcb and ultimately chlorobenzene cb has been observed for the α and γ hch isomers similarly degradation of the β and δ hch isomers has been proposed through tcch 1 2 3 trichlorobenzene tcb and cb via 1 2 dcb and 1 4 dcb 14 this is true in case of individual isomers however the technical mixture of the four isomers used in this study indicated the formation of pcch in traces which could be explained by the transformation of the four isomers however formation of tri or dichlorobenzenes was not observed in this study this could be due to the prevalent degrading microorganisms which corresponds with the observation by 49 other reports have also stated insignificant or no accumulation of intermediate compound and their immediate further degradation by the methanogenic bacteria present in the sludge 50 different degradation routes of hch have been hypothesized in extant literature where monochlorobenzene is the major end product of the degradation of α β γ δ hch isomers 51 fig 5 the degradation of α and γ hch isomers proceed through the formation of tcch and ultimately to benzene formation of tri and tetrachlorobenzenes has also been studied for the anaerobic degradation of γ hch 26 4 discussion as has been stated basic knowledge of the degradation of hch during the acclimatization process and corresponding biochemical pathways is necessary to make bioremediation feasible before venturing into reactor start up studies for the ultimate management of toxic compounds 24 the word adaptation or acclimation as it is frequently applied to refers to the modifications made by the microbial population in reaction to environmental changes regardless of the processes involved in the process mutation enzyme adaptation cell structure modification and population composition changes due to multiplication mortality or shifts in dominance are among the prevalent adaptive processes 30 this study examined the correlation between different parameters and degradation percentage when the biological sludge was acclimatized to 1 0 g l 1 concentration of hch a higher concentration was taken to adapt the microbial biomass in a batch reactor of 5 l capacity which was further assessed for its performance in a uasb reactor fig s1 the results indicated that although complete degradation was not achieved degradation percentage increased from 49 23 to 60 17 the degradation percentage gradually increased and reached upto 49 23 on day 44 while the degradation time reduced from 44 days to 20 days then ultimately 17 days with 60 17 degradation on day 196 degradation was further confirmed by analyzing the gas chromatogram profiles of different hch isomers where all the peaks were reduced after five months of the acclimatization period apart from the reduction in the peaks the appearance of new peaks indicating possible formation of intermediates during the degradation process was another interesting aspect degradation time with the intermittent co substrate addition ranged from three weeks to six months and was not associated with complete t hch mineralization after this batch of degradation t hch was not added because complete degradation was not achieved thus only the co substrate was added this is evident from the graph no specific trend was seen after the 69th day however for every addition of the co substrate the main substrate must also be added to ensure efficient degradation addition of external carbon source has also been reported to have a profound effect in enhancing the acclimation of anaerobic sludge as well as in stimulating the dechlorination activity of chlorophenols and other chlorinated compounds 52 53 this irregular chloride trend can also be attributed to the methanogenic activity which could have been affected due to the temperature variations when the average temperature fell to 25 c since the anaerobic degradation processes are conducive to the mesophilic temperature range of 30 40 c the degradation was effective and efficient during the initial three months june july and august and february when the temperature was between 30 and 35 c the total organic carbon decreased during the start up process which further confirmed the degradation of hch as soluble carbon which postulates its absorption by the cells or transformation into intermediate by products of hch degradation a slight drop in the ph was observed during the batch process which could be attributed to the production of vfas which were ultimately transformed to methane as observed subsequently by the production of gases 31 an optimum hrt of 48 h was suitable for achieving enhanced degradation beyond 48 h hrt did not influence degradation percentage this also signifies the effectiveness of the sludge for the degradation of t hch wherein 100 mg l 1 t hch was degraded by 90 13 when operated at 48 h hrt whereas it took almost a month to degrade 91 63 of 1 g l 1 t hch a ten fold high concentration during the acclimation period the growth inhibitory toxic nature of t hch is evident when operated at such high concentrations in the present study olr at 66 6 mg l 1d 1 with 1 g l 1 t hch and hrt of 15 days resulted in 60 17 degradation efficiency this degradation efficiency was greatly enhanced at 100 mg l 1 hch when olr was reduced to 50 mg l 1d 1 considering 48 h hrt using this acclimatized sludge such examinations are useful for conducting lab experiments where acclimatization is an essential prerequisite before initiating the optimization of the reactor performance parameters the source of seed sludge is an equally important aspect because the acclimatization process largely depends on the microbial species composition and its enzymes in the sludge in one of the studies the lag or interval period of treatment by the sludge of the recalcitrant compounds was less than that of the sludge treating simple compounds due to the development of abundant microorganisms caused by the exposure to the recalcitrant pollutant when the biological sludge treats chlorophenols 19 acclimatization is a very significant process as its effectiveness depends on the expression of enzymes that are responsible for the dehalogenation and degradation of halogenated compounds 19 the reduction in the degradation time with the periodic addition of hch indicates that the biomass had sufficiently adjusted to the substrate over the period of time therefore the acclimatized sludge took nearly two months to achieve 60 degradation of 1 g l 1 hch concentration a similar study demonstrated that the phenol had an inhibitory effect on the growing conditions at concentrations beyond 400 mg l 1 when used in the concentration range between 50 and 1000 mg l 1 in order to have the acclimatization stage for the culture the organism displayed a brief lag phase at high substrate concentrations whereas the lag phase was missing at low concentrations 54 in a similar vein acclimatization of the sewage treatment facility mixed culture was performed to allow it to thrive in the presence of phenol as the single carbon supply up to a maximal of 800 mg l 1 concentration in the beginning glucose was used to acclimatise the culture subsequently it was grown on phenol only it was discovered that phenol concentrations ranging from 100 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 had no inhibitory impact on the microorganisms as evidenced by almost no lag period during development however the growth exhibited with these phenol concentrations was found to be lower than when cultivated in 500 mg l 1 of phenol 55 throughout the process the ph of the medium was nearly neutral it fell slightly to 6 4 before returning to 7 a change in the carbon percentage was not observed however active biomass increased during the process with minor fluctuations possibly because of the homogeneity issue fig s2 this study can be useful for understanding the relationship between different parameters during the acclimatization process of sludge with hch a similar study by 10 also reported the toxicity in terms of total inhibition imposed by the hch isomers at 500 mg of hch kg 1 soil towards the methanogenic activity of the sludge however for lesser t hch concentration in batch study in uasb reactor the degradation efficiency of the sludge was 96 69 after reducing hrt to 48 h the source of the sludge is also an important aspect as the microbial diversity greatly affects the biodegradation process the acclimatization period could have been further reduced had the sludge been taking from reactors that were already treating chlorinated compounds in one of the similar studies when used as the single carbon source at a final quantity of 1000 ppm sludge adapted to a specific aromatic compound was able to oxidise over 85 of the compound 30 however in effect a non acclimated sludge was incapable of oxidising the 35 aromatic compounds examined in contrast to sludges adapted to a specific aromatic compound could also oxidise compounds of comparable structure presumably via the same metabolic route 56 these findings could have significant practical implications adaptation of sludge to an aromatic compound that is readily decomposed could be used to create sludge capable of degrading resistant compounds particularly those found in industrial effluent clearly acclimation studies can be beneficial to chemical businesses creating freshly synthesized organic chemical goods lag time is a significant aspect in understanding the fate of the compounds residing in the environment since pure evaluation of active biomass is not a determinant factor for the estimation of the acclimatization process the co relation between different parameters is essential to comprehend their relationship with the accultured biomass aside from that specific degradation goals can be met by building a suitable reactor to support appropriate biomass maintain nutrient conditions and most importantly remove or remediate contaminants in this regard the start up of the uasb system is the most important stage in determining its subsequent performance the acclimation or modification of the microbes to a particular substrate is the primary stage in the operation of a continuous reactor 57 the anaerobic microbes needed for the process are permitted to develop during startup until a suitably active population is present in the biomass to allow anaerobic digestion to proceed reliably 21 the start up process described by 58 as a fairly sensitive and time consuming process will decide whether a highly active biomass with excellent settling abilities has developed in the reactor due to the low growth rate of methanogenic organisms the long start up time needed in the utilization of anaerobic breakdown particularly in uasb bioreactors is a significant issue 59 environmental factors such as ph temperature and starting contaminant content all play an important part in the metabolic development of organisms hence this sort of aggressive acclimatization of the sludge with such pops as well as improving appropriate environmental conditions in batch reactors can be accomplished prior to reactor commissioning to achieve optimum degradation in one of the similar studies by 21 the time required for biomass acclimatization during substrate change was very likely added to the bioreactor s total actual start up time for ultimate residential wastewater treatment in this case the contaminated soil can also be taken from the area and cleaned in such bioreactor systems following soil washing to assist in the removal of toxins from the soil 60 this will ensure safe pollutant degradation in a confined system and prevent the unlikely chance of hazardous intermediates seeping into groundwater while in situ treatment is taking place 5 conclusion this study provides the trend of biodegradation which may be essential before venturing into anaerobic degradation of recalcitrant compounds like t hch the degradation of t hch greatly depends on the source of sludge and the external carbon source as a co substrate the addition of the co substrate in the target compound greatly enhanced the dechlorination degradation process the lag phase of the degradation process reduced over time with the increase in biomass indicating the significance of electron donors and co substrate for the acceleration of the degradation process therefore this study is important as the effectiveness of the degradation process during adaptation of the sludge gives is a direct measure of the potential of anaerobic degradation of non growth supporting compounds factors such as ph

12500,this study examined the anaerobic degradation of technical hexachlorocyclohexane t hch a persistent organic pollutant pop using a batch reactor and the influence of ph active biomass as volatile suspended solids vss total suspended solids total organic carbon chloride release and elemental composition on an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor start up chloride release a direct indicator of hch degradation was measured to confirm the process during the initial sludge acclimatization only 49 23 degradation efficiency was seen after 45 days with an initial concentration of 1 0 g l 1 however when electron donors and co substrates were added to the sludge the degradation time was shortened to 15 days with an increase in efficiency up to 60 17 when this adapted sludge was taken in a uasb reactor start up at 100 mg l 1 hch this degradation effectiveness was significantly improved when organic loading rate olr was decreased to 50 mg l 1 d 1 assuming 48 h hydraulic retention time hrt in a uasb reactor start up at 100 mg l 1 hch during the original uasb reactor start up 92 37 90 64 85 72 and 83 26 degradation of the alpha gamma beta and delta isomers with evidence of pentachlorocyclohexene as a transitory intermediate was observed the major determining variables for reactor start up were found to be neutral ph mesophilic temperature addition of co substrate glucose vss hrt and olr the study s innovation is that it examines the efficacy of the degradation process during sludge acclimatization and gives useful details about the variables to consider when starting up a uasb reactor this research gives a biodegradation trend which may be required before venturing for anaerobic degradation of recalcitrant substances like t hch graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords t hexachlorocyclohexane hch isomers lindane persistent organic pollutant acclimatization uasb reactor start up data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction technical hexachlorocyclohexane t hch is a broad spectrum organochlorine pesticide which has caused severe global environmental contamination due to its indiscriminate disposal it is applied as a technical mixture comprising α hch β hch γ hch δhch hch stereo isomers occurring in varying concentrations such as 60 70 5 12 10 12 6 10 and 2 3 respectively 1 however only the gamma isomer is termed as lindane which essentially carries the insecticidal property it has been applied and used as the purified form in many developed countries 2 however the production of lindane from technical hch involves several purification steps which add to its cost consequently in developing countries like india it is used as a technical mixture since 1 0 t of lindane manufacturing produces around nine tonnes of other waste muck comprising complex mixture of other isomers serious contamination is caused due to open stockpiles of t hch in the environment 3 based on this production rate it is estimated that around 4 8 million tonnes of hch waste residue exists across the globe for the global elimination of this pesticide the persistent organic pollutant pop review committee poprc registered lindane as a persistent organic pollutant pop in annexure a of the stockholm convention 2009 along with two other isomers that is α hch and β hch 1 therefore researchers are working on the remediation of this pop among several physical and chemical treatments biological treatment has been gaining attention due to its cost effectiveness and eco friendly nature 4 the heavily chlorinated aspect of hch makes it an electron deficient entity consequently it can function as a terminal electron acceptor in a biological process by undergoing reductive dechlorination in an anaerobic system when supplied with a suitable electron donor since the removal of the chlorine atom is to be accomplished via reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions the degradation of lindane is essentially presumed to be an anaerobic process however both aerobic and anaerobic routes of lindane biodegradation have been elucidated although its entire degrading process has been identified in sphingomonas paucimobilis ut26 under aerobic conditions 5 the process is very slow and other aerobic microbes often fail in metabolizing the hch completely apart from the microbial degradation of lindane in pure or mixed cultures 6 9 certain anaerobic studies have used sewage sludge to review the same 10 12 to degrade 100 mg l 1 of t hch 500 mg l 1 methanol was used as an electron donor this concentration was found optimum for the dechlorination of hch in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket bioreactor uasb 12 maximum transformation of the β hch with sucrose as its substrate was observed in uasb reactors using three different substrates that is volatile fatty acids vfas methanol and sucrose 13 similarly higher degradation of β hch along with δ hch was achieved by using starch as a co substrate against a combination of acetic acid propionic acid and butyric in 4 1 1 ratio 10 using an anaerobic sludge in liquid slurry systems alpha and gamma isomers degraded after 30 days while beta and delta isomer degraded after 120 days 14 the deployment of bioreactor systems as a cleanup technology is an appealing choice for pollutant decomposition because optimizing the bioremediation process makes managing the process parameters simple hch being a strongly chlorinated pollutant during its degradation processes creates noxious intermediates such as pentachlorocyclohexene that are far more toxic than the primary chemical itself ex situ remediation methods such as the use of bioreactor devices are recommended in these cases most studies using bioreactor systems have examined the degradation of 50 mg l 1 or less hch 15 17 reports that have described anaerobic hch degradation in bioreactor systems like uasb using sewage sludge with higher hch concentration remain scant 18 for recalcitrant compounds like pops a considerable period of acclimatization is required to achieve biological treatment of the target compound the acclimatization process introduces new degrading species by exerting selective pressure over the biological community of the sludge through the induction of the dechlorinating enzymes this process has practical applications especially for the chemical industry such as treating recalcitrant compounds hence it becomes an important aspect prior to the anaerobic degradation processes at the reactor level 19 23 testing the effectiveness of degradation studies in labs elucidating the mechanisms through complex systems for their subsequent implementation ensures the effectiveness of any environmental biotechnology approach 24 1 1 significance of the study although there are many studies that deal with the anaerobic degradation of hch studies which examine the factors that influence the start up of reactor with the acclimatized sludge remain scant thus this study focuses on the degradation of t hch which is the main substrate at a high concentration in a batch mode using anaerobic sludge employing glucose as a co substrate as well as electron donor it investigates the degradation achieved along with a co relation between different parameters these parameters include co substrate organic carbon content ph and elemental composition of the sludge which are affected during the degradation process the acclimatized sludge was used to run a full scale uasb reactor for actual continuous studies however the aim of this paper is to present the dynamics of sludge adaptation during the degradation process in the context of the above mentioned parameters which will ultimately influence the initial reactor start up consequently reactor studies are not the main focus of this paper this study provides useful start up data which can be beneficial before venturing into the degradation of such persistent organic compound like hch in bioreactors in many of the research work reported above direct reactor studies are mentioned using the sludge for the degradation of hch or other recalcitrant compounds also very low concentration of hch was employed for many of the reactor studies reported till date none of the studies to the best of author s knowledge describes the dynamics of the sludge adaptation and how the parameters influence the start up of uasb hence this study can provide useful insight on the reactor start up dynamics for the researchers in the field these initial sludge adaptation and start up studies can prove beneficial before venturing into the degradation of pops utilising reactor systems uasb in particular the work s novelty hence stems from the useful insights discovered during sludge acclimatization which have practical uses for the chemical industry in terms of handling recalcitrant substances like hch via a biotechnological pathway the manuscript includes helpful start up data for treating hexachlorocyclohexane isomers in a reactor setup to the best of the author s understanding this is the first research to suggest reactor start up data for this contaminant s treatment full scale successful and cost effective on site remediation of the lindane polluted site is a major challenge because there is no robust technology for the onsite treatment of hch 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals technical hexachlorocyclohexane t hch was obtained from m s kanoria chemicals renukoot sonbhadra district in uttar pradesh india with the following compositions of α β γ and δ isomers 68 9 6 9 16 6 and 7 6 respectively stock solution of t hch was prepared in n hexane acetone 80 20 the analytical grade n hexane acetone methanol glucose from merck india ltd mumbai india were also used 2 2 seed preparation for reactor start up the seed inoculum used in the batch experiments comprised partially digested cow dung and sludge from a reactor engaged in the wastewater treatment at a food processing industry nagpur in a 50 50 v v ratio the initial biomass concentration of the sludge was 67 g l 1 volatile suspended solid vss and a specific methanogenic activity sma of 0 32 g chemical oxygen demand cod ch4 g vss 1 d 1 the sludge was stored at 4 c and washed two to three times with distilled water to remove residual soluble matter before using it in experiments 10 the mineral salt media comprised in mg l 1 k2hpo4 25 kh2po4 32 and nh4 2hpo4 132 with trace elements 1 ml l 1 the trace element solution contained g l 1 10 mnso4 7h2o 3 mncl2 h2o 1 cocl2 6h2o 2 nicl2 6h2o 2 na2moo4 6h2o 30 h3bo3 and 1 cucl2 medium ph was set at 7 4 0 3 with 0 1 n naoh or 0 2 n h2so4 glucose was used as the co substrate and t hch as the main substrate was used in a liquid medium after dissolving it in 80 20 n hexane and acetone mixture 2 3 design of uasb reactor for the degradation studies an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb was designed to examine the degradation of hch isomers in batch mode using the acclimatized sludge fig s1 a tubular perplexes reactor 50 8 cm in height with a gross volume of 4 5 l and working volume of 3 5 to 4 l was fabricated six sampling ports were installed in the reactor at equidistance 13 cm the upper side of the reactor was connected to a liquid displacement as a gas outlet and the bottom of the reactor was connected to a peristaltic pump for facilitating hch seed inlet 2 4 anaerobic degradation of t hch the sludge was acclimatized in a 5 l aspirator bottle with 1 0 g l 1 t hch concentration in a batch mode operation with 0 5 g l 1 glucose as the co substrate fig 1 the bottle was tightly capped with a rubber stopper and incubated at 37 c and ph 7 0 and constantly mixed by keeping it on a magnetic stirrer initial seed acclimation was performed in a 5 l aspirator bottle in order to provide proper mixing conditions by keeping it on constant mixing with magnetic stirring since the seed consisted of partially digested cow dung and anaerobic sludge in 50 50 volume by volume ratio the mixture initially was very heterogeneous also the uasb does not have any mixing provision so the sludge was initially subjected to vigorous acclamation to ensure the proper mixing of the substrate hch with the msm and the seed sludge the acclimatization studies were carried using this sludge which was further taken for uasb start up studies at day 0 only 1 0 g l 1 t hch concentration was added after one week to this 0 5 g l 1 of glucose was added as the co substrate in the second and third week without any addition of the t hch and glucose addition which was completely stopped in the fourth week samples were extracted daily for ph evaluation total organic carbon toc carbon hydrogen nitrogen sulphur chns free chloride ion release total suspended solids tss and vss to monitor the t hch degradation during the course of the experiment samples were initially withdrawn and analyzed for the presence of chlorides only to monitor the degradation however the routine analysis of other parameters was performed regularly after 50 days when removal efficiency reached a near constant highest value glucose was added again the concentration of the co substrate was 0 5 g l 1 at each addition the gas outlet was attached to an alkaline liquid displacement for the measurement of methane production 2 5 analytical methods total organic carbon toc and elemental composition in terms of carbon hydrogen nitrogen sulphur chns were analyzed using toc analyser v cph total organic carbon analyser shimadzu and chns analyser vario micro elementar respectively tss vss and chlorides by argentometric method were measured as per the standard methods apha 25 the presence of chlorides was observed since day one however other parameters were continuously monitored after 50 days for a month and then intermittently to examine the change corresponding with the degradation percentage the degradation percentage was based on the dechlorination percentage thus these terms are used interchangeably throughout the paper 2 6 extraction gc ecd and gc ms analysis the sample extraction method was modified slightly as per 14 by adding 3 ml of sludge to 6 ml of 80 20 n hexane acetone in the 15 ml falcon tube this concoction was vortexed for 10 min to ensure proper mixing this was followed by subjecting the sample to centrifuge at 2500 rpm for 10 min to transfer hch and residues to the organic phase from the slurry the organic phase was further refined by letting it pass via a silica gel column made of three layers of activated silica gel wedged between anhydrous sodium sulphate the washing aliquots were concentrated in a rotary evaporator before being run in gc ecd at appropriate dilutions following that the quantity of t hch in the sample was determined using a gas chromatograph model clarus 690 perkin elmer usa equipped with a 63ni electron capture detector we used a db 5 column 30 m long with an interior thickness of 0 25 mm and 0 25 m film the injector furnace and detection temperatures were kept at 280 c 180 c and 280 c respectively with a split ratio of 1 2 the transport gas was nitrogen with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 after degradation hch residues and intermediates were analyzed in a varian 450 gc coupled with an ms 240 separation was performed using a db 5 ms column 30 m in length 0 25 mm id and 0 25 μm film thickness the temperature of the oven was set to rise from 60 c with a 1 min hold to 170 c at a rate of 40 c min and then to 310 c at a rate of 10 c min with a 3 min hold 1 μl of sample was injected into the gc with the injector temperature adjusted to 280 c the ion trap was elevated to 200 degrees celsius and the acquiring mass ranged from 50 to 600 da as well as the fragmentation pattern were noted the retention time of α hch was 7 89 min β hch 8 23 min γ hch 8 34 min and δ hch 8 9 min respectively using external reference calibration hch isomers were measured in the range of 0 1 to 20 mg l 1 the recovery of hch isomers was 80 2 7 reactor start up and operation the treated seed 3 l 15 g l 1 ts was fed into the uasb reactor and operated in batch mode to examine the sludge s efficiency for hch degradation initially 50 mg l 1 concentration of t hch and 500 mg l 1 concentration of glucose were introduced into the reactor degradation was examined as a measure of chloride release after achieving constant degradation percentage t hch concentration was gradually increased to 100 mg l 1 by gradually incrementing the hch concentration from 50 mg l 1 to 70 90 mg l 1 and ultimately 100 mg l 1 with a constant glucose concentration 2 8 gas analysis the existence of biogas was quantitatively considered by the alkaline displacement method the outlet of the gas was connected with the liquid displacement assembly as shown in the diagram the qualitative assessment for quantifying ch4 was however performed on gc tcd thermal conductivity detector attached to a porapack q packed column the operating temperatures of the detector and injector were each 100 c respectively oven was kept at 50 c for the duration of the 2 min run the flow rate was kept at 25 ml min 3 results 3 1 degradation studies during sludge acclimatization the batch degradation studies were carried out in a 5 l aspirator bottle with an initial 1 0 g l 1 t hch concentration for the acclimatization of the sludge it was observed there was a lag phase of about 5 days with dechlorination of t hch only about 15 20 was observed at the initial hch concentration afterwards it was seen that 49 23 degradation was achieved in terms of dechlorination in 44 days however this time was gradually reduced to 17 days with an increase in degradation percentage upto 60 17 after addition of t hch again from the 48th day subsequent to addition of another dose of t hch a gradual increase in the dechlorination percentage was observed reaching up to an average of 56 07 over a period of eight days the chloride release was slow and unstable and reached up to 60 17 within 22 days of the feed switch the duration of degradation was further reduced to 10 days indicating the biomass adaptation to t hch fig 1 the maximum removal efficiency plateau indicates the presence of sufficient microbial population necessary to sustain and progress anaerobic digestion stably during the acclimatization process various parameters were also analyzed to assess the relationship between them and the degradation percentage thus the degradation was monitored during the batch process to check for the reduction of t hch in terms of chloride release as a measure of t hch degradation in the batch studies degradation of t hch 1 g l 1 upto 60 17 after 14 days was observed this degradation percentage increased to 91 63 when hrt was further increased to 15 days increasing the duration to four more weeks resulted in however only 9 more degradation 3 1 1 co substrate addition volatile suspended solids vss was examined as a measure of active biomass during the degradation since t hch is not a growth enhancing substrate the sludge had to be subjected to a suitable co substrate to sustain the growth of bacterial biomass glucose was chosen as an appropriate co substrate because it is a ubiquitous electron donor that can aid in the reductive dechlorination process as well as microbial development as can be seen from the graph fig 2 after day 55 the bacterial biomass increased with every addition of the co substrate this corresponded with the increasing release of chloride indicating degradation this was initially observed after day 7 after one week and day 14 after two weeks wherein the slight addition of glucose resulted in the rise of the degradation percentage further increase in the removal efficiency from 47 86 to 58 81 was observed on day 66 after the addition of the co substrate on day 55 after this only the co substrate was added to the mixture no specific trend was observed during upto day 93 after which again the degradation percentage remained constant for a long period at 55 95 when the chlorides remained constant over a large period of time t hch addition was done again at day 174 this is an important aspect in the acclimatization process because it indicates that the biomass utilized the target compound and adjusted to it releasing chloride further addition of the co substrate activated the biomass and increased the release of chloride this trend was clearly observed in batches where the sludge was introduced with co substrates at various intervals that is days 55 69 and 87 the results indicated that the external carbon source which was used as a co substrate not only reduced the lag period for degradation but also enhanced the dechlorination rate from 48 to 60 fig 2 different co substrates have been tried and tested for the degradation of hch in a similar study dealing with the degradation of hch 500 mg l 1 optimum concentration of methanol was employed as an electron donor and a co substrate to degrade 100 mg l 1 of t hch in a uasb 12 similarly anaerobic slurry reactor was utilized for the degradation of hch isomers it was observed that the degradation rates for β and δ hch were high when starch was used as the substrate against vfas like acetic propionic and butyric acid in 4 1 1 ratio 10 on the other hand 26 noticed the promotion of γ hch dechlorination under anaerobic circumstances in the presence of several co substrates with glucose being the most active stimulator 27 demonstrated the opposing impacts of acetate on the breakdown of γ and β hch by pseudomonas sp acetate accelerated the decomposition of α hch while significantly decelerating the degradation of γ hch whereas some studies reported that the activated sludge required as long as four weeks to adjust to metabolise different aromatic substances 28 another study reported that the response of activated sediment to sorbitol took only three days 29 such high lag times during the acclimation of sludge with the recalcitrant compounds are often reported as the time required to achieve complete acclimation of an activated sludge system is highly contingent on the intricacy of the substrate examined 30 3 1 2 total organic carbon organic carbon oc is an important parameter in the acclimatization process because different metabolic processes affect the carbon balance during the degradation mechanism if soluble carbon is taken up by the cell then the active biomass increases however soluble carbon can decrease when carbon fractions are transformed into carbon dioxide or methane 31 throughout the process oc decreased from 2582 mg l 1 to 927 mg l 1 fig 3 fluctuation in the amount of toc 500 9000 mg l 1 was observed during the acculturation of the microbial community that treated the table olive processing wastewater however almost 90 toc removal was achieved using the acclimatized biomass in the membrane bioreactor system 32 nevertheless the percentage of carbon signifying elemental carbon content trend remained constant throughout the acclimatization process fig s2 a study on the elementary composition of dry compost sewage sludge using chns did not report great variation in the contents of carbon hydrogen nitrogen and sulfur during the acclimatization period 33 while there were no significant differences in the elemental composition of the sludge during the maturation process other parameters like toc ph and biomass changed significantly 3 1 3 ph during the sludge acclimation ph dropped to 6 4 from 7 however ph during the anaerobic degradation throughout remained between 7 0 3 fig s3 this could be explained by the formation of vfas and their probable further conversion into methane gas showing that the anaerobic digestion was progressing well in the batch process 31 this could be ascertained by quantifying the methane gas produced biogas production was confirmed by quantifying the gas via the alkaline displacement assuring the functioning of anaerobic digestion throughout the acclimatization process a clear trend or correlation between biogas production and degradation percentage was not observed in one of such studies irregular patterns of biogas production without any correlation with cod removal rate were also observed during acclimatization of the microbial biomass to the sequential addition of substrates in the uasb reactor 21 this could be because of the uncertainty of measurement due to the possible negative pressure developed or clogging issues which in turn was caused by the utilization of oxygen by the facultative anaerobic bacteria this could be due to a process flaw or a technical mistake during the original setup 21 3 1 4 temperature temperature is conducive for sustaining the microorganisms and various metabolic activities associated with them anaerobic activity can take place relatively high at mesophilic temperature of 35 c exhibiting maximum specific methanogenic activity at this temperature however an increase in biomass or high hydraulic retention time is required to achieve the similar methanogenic activity at temperatures other than 35 c 34 hch degradation was studied and observed during the whole degradation period at different temperature ranges degradation time of hch isomers with the intermittent co substrate addition ranged from three weeks to six months and was not associated with complete t hch degradation after this batch of degradation t hch was not added because complete degradation was not achieved thus only the co substrate was added this is evident from the graph no specific trend was seen after the 69th day however for every addition of the co substrate the main substrate must also be added to ensure efficient degradation this irregular chloride trend can also be attributed to the methanogenic activity which could have been affected due to the temperature variations when the average temperature fell below 25 c since the anaerobic degradation processes are conducive to the mesophilic temperature range of 30 40 c the degradation was effective and efficient during the initial three months june july and august and february when the temperature was between 30 and 35 c fig s4 temperature of 30 c is found to be suitable for hch degradation by anaerobic slurry cultures in an anaerobic bioreactor 14 35 similarly a slurry batch bioreactor employing single culture of bjerkandera adusta could significantly degrade different isomers at 30 c 36 the optimal temperature for hch degradation is found to be between 25 and 30 c in bacterial cultures soil as well as soil slurry mesophilic temperature was found to be the most favourable condition for alpha hch degradation with an optimum temperature of 30 c 37 whereas around 65 lindane removal was also observed in a slurry reactor operating at 37 c 38 temperature of around 25 30 c in slurry bioreactors have been reported to perform well at lower ambient temperature as well 39 hch degradation at extreme temperatures have not been reported and also some studies have shown that temperature is an insignificant factor in alpha hch degradation 40 it should also be noted that in anaerobic bioreactors methanogenesis takes place therefore any change of temperature beyond the mesophilic range can negatively hamper the methane generation due to the inactivation of mesophilic granular sludge 41 3 1 5 active biomass fig 2 depicts the microbial status of the sludge during batch mode with 1 g l 1 concentration of t hch in the acclimatization it should be noted here that sometimes the estimation of total active biomass does not correctly estimate biodegradation rate because it largely depends on the homogeneous collection of samples from the system it is often implied that the biomass concentration should be concomitant with the substrate concentration and degradation because the substrate is utilized by the biomass to produce energy for the growth and maintenance of cells however this is not the case in practical situations the inhibition effects due to high substrate concentration and accumulation of toxic intermediates could explain the fluctuations or low biomass concentrations during specific intervals 42 this study reports similar observations however the active biomass in terms of vss denotes that the bio community started degrading hch and multiplying thereby increasing the biomass 32 the existence of organic matter and other readily utilisable chemical compounds is another significant element that may influence the biodegradability of any toxic substance in the natural environment acetone was found to marginally increase α hch degradation while benzoate and ethanol retarded degradation resulting in delayed cl release when using an unacclimated consortium glucose at greater concentrations suppressed the degradation rate whereas the impact was not as evident when using an acclimated consortium when the co substrate is used as a favored growing substrate retardation can occur 37 these evidences can further explain the possible fluctuations in active biomass probably due to this phenomenon the preferred use of acetate as a growth substrate was believed to explain the delayed degradation of γ hch in an acetate added medium 43 the identical scenario could have unfolded in this instance as the unacclimated consortium was initially used and it almost took 45 days to achieve 49 23 degradation efficiency fig 1 however when the consortium was repeatedly exposed to t hch the microbes may have lost their ability to use glucose effectively as a growth substrate resulting in improved utilization of t hch even in the presence of glucose this is demonstrated by the fact that the enhanced growth caused by glucose is not as noticeable in the acclimated consortium as it is in the unacclimated one 37 this can also explain the lag time which got reduced from 45 days to 22 days and further down to 17 days as the active biomass was getting acclimated to the hch 3 1 6 statistical analysis of data data on t hch degradation during the start up experiment were analyzed by correlation and multiple regression method using ibm spss software version 26 correlation and regression were used to calculate the degradation percentage chloride release keeping the number of days as the independent variable was examined was done separately because it was calculated right from the first day table 1a however for other parameters the analysis was conducted after 50 days for approximately a month it was observed that the number of days was positively correlated with degradation percentage chlorides active biomass in terms of vss and carbon percentage and negatively correlated with total carbon and ph this implies that the concentration of chloride vss and carbon percentage increased during the acclimatization period there is a significant positive relationship between days and other correlation parameters such as chloride degradation total organic carbon percent carbon and ph r 26 0 90 also p 0 005 confirms the statistical significance of the data table 1b 3 2 degradation in the uasb reactor with the acclimatized sludge parameters factors examined in association with the degradation process using the seed inoculum section 2 7 were taken into consideration to determine what influences reactor start up the influent containing the msm with 100 mg l 1 t hch were fed into the uasb reactor from the bottom inlet port with the aid of the peristaltic pump and various parameters were studied during the degradation process routine analysis of the parameters such as ph tss vss chlorides release and degradation percentage was conducted in the batch mode the average monthly estimates of the parameters studied are represented in table 2 the amount of total solids ts during reactor startup was 15 g l 1 which increased to 27 g ts l 1 with an average vs ts ratio of 0 85 the hydraulic retention time hrt was observed as a key parameter that indicates the average residence time of the compound that remains in the bioreactor 44 it is usually expressed as the ratio of the volume of reactor to the flow rate and often expressed in days or hours t hch in uasb reactor was dechlorinated with upto 90 degradation with a 48 h hrt when the hrt was cut to 24 or 36 h there was insufficient dechlorination while increasing the hrt to 60 h did not show any enhanced degradation an optimum hrt ensures the proper degradation of compound along with maintaining sufficient biomass also organic loading rates olrs are related to hrt longer hrts often result in biomass accumulation while shorter hrts result in them being washed out 45 besides hrt olr also plays a significant role in efficiently degrading the compound which is measured by the amount of organic material added per m3 of the reactor volume per day the performance of the reactor is greatly influenced with the simultaneous increase in olr however beyond a certain point it can be unfavorable for the reactor s performance 46 carbon balances between the influent and effluent samples liquid as well as gaseous showed predicted gas volume of approximately 300 ml where 45 of the total gas comprised of ch4 while approximately 50 consisted of co2 5 unidentified gases the observed values showed 270 ml of gas production corresponding to 0 260 g mol and 0 795 g mol of ch4 and co2 as against predicted values of 0 309 g mol and 0 897 g mol ch4 and co2 respectively s1 another batch of the reactor was operated with lesser hch concentration by gradually increasing t hch concentration from 50 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 over 60 days with media recirculation through peristaltic pump initially the time required by the reactor to achieve 90 13 degradation of 100 mg l 1 t hch was 28 days which was reduced to five days and ultimately to two days achieving upto 90 13 t hch degradation fig s4 the degradation profiles of the four isomers examined using gc ms reported 92 37 90 64 85 72 and 83 26 degradation of α γ β and δ hch respectively the α and γ hch isomers displayed better degradation results compared to the β and δ isomers since the initial hch concentration was quite high complete degradation was not observed the appearance of pentachlorocyclohexene pcch as a transient intermediate was also observed which eventually disappeared or possibly transformed into other by products during the degradation process fig 4 studies by 47 48 observed the transitory formation of pcch from hch under anaerobic conditions formation of pcch and tetrachlorocyclohexene tcch from hch further 1 2 dichlorobenzene 1 2 dcb and 1 3 dichlorobenzene 1 3 dcb and ultimately chlorobenzene cb has been observed for the α and γ hch isomers similarly degradation of the β and δ hch isomers has been proposed through tcch 1 2 3 trichlorobenzene tcb and cb via 1 2 dcb and 1 4 dcb 14 this is true in case of individual isomers however the technical mixture of the four isomers used in this study indicated the formation of pcch in traces which could be explained by the transformation of the four isomers however formation of tri or dichlorobenzenes was not observed in this study this could be due to the prevalent degrading microorganisms which corresponds with the observation by 49 other reports have also stated insignificant or no accumulation of intermediate compound and their immediate further degradation by the methanogenic bacteria present in the sludge 50 different degradation routes of hch have been hypothesized in extant literature where monochlorobenzene is the major end product of the degradation of α β γ δ hch isomers 51 fig 5 the degradation of α and γ hch isomers proceed through the formation of tcch and ultimately to benzene formation of tri and tetrachlorobenzenes has also been studied for the anaerobic degradation of γ hch 26 4 discussion as has been stated basic knowledge of the degradation of hch during the acclimatization process and corresponding biochemical pathways is necessary to make bioremediation feasible before venturing into reactor start up studies for the ultimate management of toxic compounds 24 the word adaptation or acclimation as it is frequently applied to refers to the modifications made by the microbial population in reaction to environmental changes regardless of the processes involved in the process mutation enzyme adaptation cell structure modification and population composition changes due to multiplication mortality or shifts in dominance are among the prevalent adaptive processes 30 this study examined the correlation between different parameters and degradation percentage when the biological sludge was acclimatized to 1 0 g l 1 concentration of hch a higher concentration was taken to adapt the microbial biomass in a batch reactor of 5 l capacity which was further assessed for its performance in a uasb reactor fig s1 the results indicated that although complete degradation was not achieved degradation percentage increased from 49 23 to 60 17 the degradation percentage gradually increased and reached upto 49 23 on day 44 while the degradation time reduced from 44 days to 20 days then ultimately 17 days with 60 17 degradation on day 196 degradation was further confirmed by analyzing the gas chromatogram profiles of different hch isomers where all the peaks were reduced after five months of the acclimatization period apart from the reduction in the peaks the appearance of new peaks indicating possible formation of intermediates during the degradation process was another interesting aspect degradation time with the intermittent co substrate addition ranged from three weeks to six months and was not associated with complete t hch mineralization after this batch of degradation t hch was not added because complete degradation was not achieved thus only the co substrate was added this is evident from the graph no specific trend was seen after the 69th day however for every addition of the co substrate the main substrate must also be added to ensure efficient degradation addition of external carbon source has also been reported to have a profound effect in enhancing the acclimation of anaerobic sludge as well as in stimulating the dechlorination activity of chlorophenols and other chlorinated compounds 52 53 this irregular chloride trend can also be attributed to the methanogenic activity which could have been affected due to the temperature variations when the average temperature fell to 25 c since the anaerobic degradation processes are conducive to the mesophilic temperature range of 30 40 c the degradation was effective and efficient during the initial three months june july and august and february when the temperature was between 30 and 35 c the total organic carbon decreased during the start up process which further confirmed the degradation of hch as soluble carbon which postulates its absorption by the cells or transformation into intermediate by products of hch degradation a slight drop in the ph was observed during the batch process which could be attributed to the production of vfas which were ultimately transformed to methane as observed subsequently by the production of gases 31 an optimum hrt of 48 h was suitable for achieving enhanced degradation beyond 48 h hrt did not influence degradation percentage this also signifies the effectiveness of the sludge for the degradation of t hch wherein 100 mg l 1 t hch was degraded by 90 13 when operated at 48 h hrt whereas it took almost a month to degrade 91 63 of 1 g l 1 t hch a ten fold high concentration during the acclimation period the growth inhibitory toxic nature of t hch is evident when operated at such high concentrations in the present study olr at 66 6 mg l 1d 1 with 1 g l 1 t hch and hrt of 15 days resulted in 60 17 degradation efficiency this degradation efficiency was greatly enhanced at 100 mg l 1 hch when olr was reduced to 50 mg l 1d 1 considering 48 h hrt using this acclimatized sludge such examinations are useful for conducting lab experiments where acclimatization is an essential prerequisite before initiating the optimization of the reactor performance parameters the source of seed sludge is an equally important aspect because the acclimatization process largely depends on the microbial species composition and its enzymes in the sludge in one of the studies the lag or interval period of treatment by the sludge of the recalcitrant compounds was less than that of the sludge treating simple compounds due to the development of abundant microorganisms caused by the exposure to the recalcitrant pollutant when the biological sludge treats chlorophenols 19 acclimatization is a very significant process as its effectiveness depends on the expression of enzymes that are responsible for the dehalogenation and degradation of halogenated compounds 19 the reduction in the degradation time with the periodic addition of hch indicates that the biomass had sufficiently adjusted to the substrate over the period of time therefore the acclimatized sludge took nearly two months to achieve 60 degradation of 1 g l 1 hch concentration a similar study demonstrated that the phenol had an inhibitory effect on the growing conditions at concentrations beyond 400 mg l 1 when used in the concentration range between 50 and 1000 mg l 1 in order to have the acclimatization stage for the culture the organism displayed a brief lag phase at high substrate concentrations whereas the lag phase was missing at low concentrations 54 in a similar vein acclimatization of the sewage treatment facility mixed culture was performed to allow it to thrive in the presence of phenol as the single carbon supply up to a maximal of 800 mg l 1 concentration in the beginning glucose was used to acclimatise the culture subsequently it was grown on phenol only it was discovered that phenol concentrations ranging from 100 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 had no inhibitory impact on the microorganisms as evidenced by almost no lag period during development however the growth exhibited with these phenol concentrations was found to be lower than when cultivated in 500 mg l 1 of phenol 55 throughout the process the ph of the medium was nearly neutral it fell slightly to 6 4 before returning to 7 a change in the carbon percentage was not observed however active biomass increased during the process with minor fluctuations possibly because of the homogeneity issue fig s2 this study can be useful for understanding the relationship between different parameters during the acclimatization process of sludge with hch a similar study by 10 also reported the toxicity in terms of total inhibition imposed by the hch isomers at 500 mg of hch kg 1 soil towards the methanogenic activity of the sludge however for lesser t hch concentration in batch study in uasb reactor the degradation efficiency of the sludge was 96 69 after reducing hrt to 48 h the source of the sludge is also an important aspect as the microbial diversity greatly affects the biodegradation process the acclimatization period could have been further reduced had the sludge been taking from reactors that were already treating chlorinated compounds in one of the similar studies when used as the single carbon source at a final quantity of 1000 ppm sludge adapted to a specific aromatic compound was able to oxidise over 85 of the compound 30 however in effect a non acclimated sludge was incapable of oxidising the 35 aromatic compounds examined in contrast to sludges adapted to a specific aromatic compound could also oxidise compounds of comparable structure presumably via the same metabolic route 56 these findings could have significant practical implications adaptation of sludge to an aromatic compound that is readily decomposed could be used to create sludge capable of degrading resistant compounds particularly those found in industrial effluent clearly acclimation studies can be beneficial to chemical businesses creating freshly synthesized organic chemical goods lag time is a significant aspect in understanding the fate of the compounds residing in the environment since pure evaluation of active biomass is not a determinant factor for the estimation of the acclimatization process the co relation between different parameters is essential to comprehend their relationship with the accultured biomass aside from that specific degradation goals can be met by building a suitable reactor to support appropriate biomass maintain nutrient conditions and most importantly remove or remediate contaminants in this regard the start up of the uasb system is the most important stage in determining its subsequent performance the acclimation or modification of the microbes to a particular substrate is the primary stage in the operation of a continuous reactor 57 the anaerobic microbes needed for the process are permitted to develop during startup until a suitably active population is present in the biomass to allow anaerobic digestion to proceed reliably 21 the start up process described by 58 as a fairly sensitive and time consuming process will decide whether a highly active biomass with excellent settling abilities has developed in the reactor due to the low growth rate of methanogenic organisms the long start up time needed in the utilization of anaerobic breakdown particularly in uasb bioreactors is a significant issue 59 environmental factors such as ph temperature and starting contaminant content all play an important part in the metabolic development of organisms hence this sort of aggressive acclimatization of the sludge with such pops as well as improving appropriate environmental conditions in batch reactors can be accomplished prior to reactor commissioning to achieve optimum degradation in one of the similar studies by 21 the time required for biomass acclimatization during substrate change was very likely added to the bioreactor s total actual start up time for ultimate residential wastewater treatment in this case the contaminated soil can also be taken from the area and cleaned in such bioreactor systems following soil washing to assist in the removal of toxins from the soil 60 this will ensure safe pollutant degradation in a confined system and prevent the unlikely chance of hazardous intermediates seeping into groundwater while in situ treatment is taking place 5 conclusion this study provides the trend of biodegradation which may be essential before venturing into anaerobic degradation of recalcitrant compounds like t hch the degradation of t hch greatly depends on the source of sludge and the external carbon source as a co substrate the addition of the co substrate in the target compound greatly enhanced the dechlorination degradation process the lag phase of the degradation process reduced over time with the increase in biomass indicating the significance of electron donors and co substrate for the acceleration of the degradation process therefore this study is important as the effectiveness of the degradation process during adaptation of the sludge gives is a direct measure of the potential of anaerobic degradation of non growth supporting compounds factors such as ph neutral range temperature mesophilic range and addition of co substrate glucose active biomass vss 15 23 g l 1 hrt 48 h and organic loading rate 50 mg l 1 d 1 mainly influence the reactor start up

12501,this study explores the potential use of recycled textile biochar rt bc and steam activated biochar rt sabc derived from insulation panels at end of life as sorbents for removing ibuprofen from aqueous solutions after steam activation the surface area and micropore volume increased subsequently kinetic and isotherm experiments were investigated at 20 c 200 rpm and 50 mg l ibuprofen solution equilibrium was reached after 24 h for rt bc and 120 h for rt sabc the kinetics of rt bc and rt sabc followed the pseudo first order and elovich models respectively rt sabc isotherm showed the highest adsorption capacity 53 9 mg g 1 well fitted into the sips model ibuprofen uptake by rt sabc was nearly irreversible afterward rt sabc dynamic performance was evaluated in a fixed bed column for three bed heights the breakthrough point 41 7 476 7 h the volume of effluent treated 0 6 6 4 l at breakthrough and adsorption capacity 22 09 39 81 mg g 1 increased with bed height 10 30 cm thomas and clark s models simulated the experimental points confirming second order kinetics and sips isotherm different functional groups were involved in the adsorption mechanism preliminary experiments in tap water on rt sabc showed a removal 83 due to ionic strength and reduced ph therefore rt sabc could be an efficient adsorbent for ibuprofen removal from aqueous systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords breakthrough curve fixed bed column steam activated biochar ibuprofen textile insulation panel tap water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the detection in surface waters of about 4000 varieties of emerging micro pollutants is becoming a source of concern for the entire population worldwide particularly in europe these emanating compounds commonly exhibit non biodegradability persistence stability hydrophilicity and ubiquity furthermore these contaminants are predominantly prone to bioaccumulation in humans and animals 1 this is the case for pharmaceutical substances including psychiatric drugs lipid regulators beta blockers antibiotics contraceptive hormones and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids after veterinary and human use 2 the primary sources of drugs in aquatic systems are landfill leachates wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents health care facilities and hospitals 3 despite their low concentrations in the environment typically at trace levels 18 to 6297 ng l in the world 4 30 to 6400 ng l in europe 5 the mixture of pharmaceuticals has the potential to be detrimental due to synergetic effects 6 and continuous exposure 7 which is prevalent in aquatic ecosystems 8 ibuprofen ibp is one of the most prescribed and consumed nsaids to relieve pain and fever originating from human excrement and urine as well as from the pharmaceutical industries and hospitals ibp ends up in wwtps 9 this drug could be excreted as an unchanged molecule or as biochemically active metabolites hydroxyl ibp or carboxy ibp 1 that may have more significant toxicity moderate to high than the original molecule particularly on green algae and invertebrates 10 ibp chemically known as 2 4 isobutylphenyl propanoic acid has a pka value of 4 91 thus this drug is weakly acidic and has a poor adsorption tendency onto wwtp sludge 9 therefore residual concentration of this micro contaminant is often encountered in european wwtps effluents and consequently discharged into the environment leading to the pollution of surface water 1 0 to 67 μg l in greece 8 0 μg l in france germany 7 5 μg l finland 16 0 μg l belgium 8 0 μg l 11 etc along with groundwater 3 to 395 ng l in europe 11 the ecotoxicology of ibp has been well examined for comprehending the harmful consequences to human health endocrine disrupting effects 12 and the aquatic environment 13 22 ibp has been found to impact severely marine fauna and flora causing genotoxic acute and chronic effects on fish 16 crustaceans 13 invertebrates 14 17 18 20 algae 15 21 bacteria 22 and plants 19 for all these reasons removing ibp from aquatic environments is of great importance for preserving ecosystems and human health conventional physical chemical or biological treatment processes adopted in wwtps are not sufficiently effective for ibp elimination or degradation because of the drug s moderate water solubility 21 mg l and high polarity 23 the conventional activated sludge process was emphasized to remove pharmaceutical compounds poorly including ibp 24 25 naproxen and ketoprofen 26 from wastewater biological techniques operating under anaerobic or aerobic conditions present poor degradability to some pharmaceutical compounds and the ibp biodegradation requires several days besides the successful technologies available including advanced oxidation processes photocatalysis fenton reaction ozonation etc and advanced treatments adsorption nanofiltration membrane bioreactor etc or hybrid technologies are more efficient for the abatement of ibp but also costly 9 although nanofiltration requires low energy to operate and is efficient for pharmaceutical elimination the membranes are easily prone to fouling 27 moreover advanced oxidation processes are recognized for their mineralization and degradation of highly resistant pollutants however they have high operation investment and energy costs require expensive chemical reagents and form highly toxic oxidative hydroxyl or sulfate radicals throughout the treatment 28 likewise catalytic membrane reactors were reported to be effective for the separation and electrocatalytic degradation of emerging organic pharmaceutical pollutants 29 nevertheless their deployment at a large scale is currently limited owing to the high cost of the electrodes 30 in this context the implementation of adsorption for ibp mitigation has been substantial compared to the aforementioned treatment techniques and has been successfully evaluated throughout the years the reason is that adsorption holds an outstanding ability to get rid of a broad type of pollutants with fast process kinetics 28 another great advantage of the adsorption process is its simplicity of operation low capital cost and high performance besides the adsorption technology enables the feasibility of integrating waste products with little or no potential economic value as well as low cost renewable and sustainable materials 31 32 this includes mainly composites 33 34 clays 35 36 polymers 37 nano adsorbents 34 38 39 non activated waste 40 and activated carbon 41 42 the utilization of cost effective adsorbents for ibp removal has well been reviewed in the literature 31 several studies have examined the ibp adsorption over activated carbon adsorbents derived from agricultural biomass wastes such as olive waste cakes mung bean husk 5 cork powder 41 rice husk 9 coconut shell 12 and olive stone 43 other activated carbon fibers investigated are those derived from chemically modified cloths oxidized by naocl or thermally treated under n2 at 700 c for 1 h 42 the majority of the studies covered batch adsorption tests to evaluate the effectiveness of adsorption as a function of the maximum uptake capacity the dynamic operation in fixed bed columns is usually desired at industrial scale owing to low operational cost and the flexibility of the systems 31 although plenty of investigations have been performed eliminating ibp using sorbents derived from building waste particularly biomass based insulation materials bims at their end of life is not yet explored at present the use of these renewable and energy efficient bims including recycled textile rt fiber panels is emerging these materials deriving from non recyclable denim wastes play an essential role in the circular economy and the transition towards low carbon and sustainable positive energy buildings at their end of life the volume of rt waste is expected to reach 2500 tons year starting from 2050 44 to date the treatment of these rt panels waste is still in its infancy and the panels are projected to end up in landfills by 2050 posing more environmental risks in a previous study we explored that reuse and recycling are hindered by several barriers and that waste to energy conversion techniques are promising strategies for this type of waste 44 in another study the pyrolysis and steam gasification of rt panels was performed it was observed that the rt pyrolysis biochar has a remarkably high specific surface area compared to other biochars hence its use as a sorbent was recommended 45 this study provides insight into the feasibility of applying novel adsorbents namely biochar and steam activated biochar derived from rt insulation panels at end of life to remove ibp from aqueous environments the objective of this work resides in comparing the behavior of both adsorbents as regards their kinetic performance and adsorption capacity in batch and dynamic adsorption experiments first both adsorbents were characterized to determine the influence of steam activation on the adsorbent properties next the ibp adsorption performance was assessed using kinetic and isotherm tests on the studied adsorbents in deionized water to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity at equilibrium a fixed bed adsorption study was then carried out to evaluate the behavior of the steam activated biochar in dynamic operation the effect of the bed height on the adsorption in continuous mode was investigated kinetic isotherm and breakthrough curves were correlated to different models using nonlinear regression analyses to understand better the adsorption mechanism subsequently the functional groups involved in the adsorption mechanism were identified by analyzing the fourier transformed infrared spectra before and after ibp adsorption finally preliminary kinetic and isotherm experiments were performed using tap water to investigate the ibp adsorption and competitivity onto rt sabc in the presence of mineral salts and ions in the solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbate ibuprofen sodium salt was used as the model adsorbate in this study this analytical compound was supplied from sigma aldrich at a purity 98 this adsorbate has been selected as it is moderately to highly soluble in water all the solutions were prepared with deionized water dw without ph adjustment the main physico chemical properties of this pharmaceutical adsorbate are shown in table 1 2 2 adsorbents rt insulation panels were purchased from the local market in france rt panels are composed of shredded textile fibers mixed with low melt polyester fibers spinning of regular and modified polyethylene terephthalate pet the product has been treated with flame retardants 10 8 wt based on organic chemicals and with antifungal products 1 wt including triclosan and octhilinone 45 owing to their low mass density and fibrous nature these panels were manually pelletized using a hydraulic press unit applying a pressure of 5 tons without a binder to form homogeneous pellets afterward the rt pellets were used as raw material to prepare the two adsorbents namely biochar rt bc and steam activated biochar rt sabc for the subsequent experiments 2 2 1 preparation rt bc and rt sabc adsorbents were prepared following the experimental procedure described by rabbat et al 45 rt bc was produced via the pyrolysis of rt pellets in an electrically heated semi rotating inconel reactor under a constant nitrogen flow rate of 750 ml min the reactor was heated at 10 c min up to 550 c and the pyrolysis temperature was maintained for 2 h after cooling the rt bc pellets were recovered and stored in sealed bottles for future analysis on the other hand rt sabc adsorbent was produced via physical activation using steam in the same reactor the activation process was preceded by pyrolysis of raw rt pellets using a heating ramp of 10 c min up to 850 c when the activation temperature was reached the nitrogen flow rate was reduced to 530 ml min then water was introduced into the reactor at 0 7 ml min the activation conditions were held for 1 h at the end of the experiment the reactor is cooled down to room temperature afterward the rt sabc was collected and kept in hermetic flasks for subsequent examination finally both adsorbents were crushed and sieved for powder removal selecting the size fraction granulometry from 0 5 to 0 8 mm for kinetic and isotherm adsorption tests and 0 5 to 1 6 mm for the dynamic column adsorption experiments before their use the adsorbents were washed with deionized water to eliminate potential impurities inside the pores 2 2 2 characterization several analyses were performed to assess both adsorbents chemical and physical properties initially both adsorbents were dried at 105 c for 24 h subsequently the elemental analysis was carried out on powdered adsorbents using a flash ea 1112 series chns o analyzer for the determination of the weight percentages of carbon c hydrogen h nitrogen n and sulfur s the oxygen o content was deduced by difference then the ash contents of the adsorbents were evaluated as the residual mass that remained after burning a triplicate of samples in a muffle furnace maintained at 815 c for 4 h afterward a physisorption unit micromeritic 3flex adsorption analyzer was used to assess the textural properties of the adsorbents using the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k this analysis is preceded by the outgassing of samples under vacuum 30 mmhg at a heating rate of 10 c min up to 350 c that is held for 48 h the brunauer emmett teller bet equation was applied to calculate the specific surface area sbet the total volume of pores vtotal was evaluated by the amount of n2 adsorbed at p p0 0 95 the volume of micropores 2 nm vmicro and the volume of mesopores 2 50 nm vmeso were determined using t plot and bjh barrett joyner halenda methods respectively the adsorption average pore diameter 4 v a was identified in addition the ph drift method was used to determine the ph point of zero charge phpzc of both adsorbents 42 47 in different flasks 50 ml of 0 01 m nacl solution was introduced then the ph of each flask was adjusted to a value ranging from 2 to 12 phinitial through the careful transfer of small quantities of 0 1 m hcl or naoh solutions using a dropper pipette consequently 150 mg of adsorbent was inserted the solution s equilibrium ph phfinal was measured after shaking at room temperature 20 c for five days in the sealed containers after plotting phfinal versus phinitial the point at which no change in the ph has occurred in the presence of the adsorbent corresponds to the phpzc phfinal phinitial a scanning electron microscope sem jeol jsm 5800 lv coupled with a dispersive energy x ray edx spectrometer was utilized to determine the morphology and the mapping of elements at the surfaces of rt sabc and rt bc prior to sem observation samples were coated with a thin layer of platinum 8 nm thickness to improve their conductivity then the analysis was realized under vacuum conditions 10 5 pa with an accelerating voltage of 15 kv and a magnification of 10 000x to investigate the functional groups on the tested adsorbents attenuated total reflection coupled to fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy was used besides this technique allows for identifying the groups involved in ibp adsorption this analysis was performed in duplicates on the adsorbents at room temperature between 400 and 4000 cm 1 to collect specific spectra recognizing different functional organic groups the spectra detect interactions between the drug and the carbonaceous matrix spectra were collected after 32 running scans at a resolution of 4 cm 1 2 3 batch adsorption tests batch adsorption tests involving the kinetic and isotherms experiments were performed for both adsorbents to study their potential removal efficiency of ibp from deionized water and tap water 2 3 1 kinetics experiments kinetic adsorption experiments were realized in an 800 ml volume of ibp solution 50 mg l in the presence of 0 5 g of rt bc or rt sabc to determine the effect of contact time on ibp adsorption despite the presence of ibp in water bodies at a low concentration μg to ng this high concentration 50 mg l was opted to ease the observation of the equilibrium during the batch adsorption experiment equilibrium reaction and the characterization of the added biochar at the end of the experiment this concentration provides more reliable results at the laboratory scale accurate weight measurement 1 mg and a measurable residual concentration of ibp in the solution quantification limit of the uv spectrophotometer with an acceptable error 5 to be able to plot kinetic isotherm and breakthrough curves the samples were prepared using a two step procedure the first step consisted of adding 0 5 g of adsorbent into 400 ml of dw and maintaining the bottles under agitation for 24 h after stabilizing the ph and removing impurities inside the adsorbent s pores 400 ml of ibp solution 100 mg l was transferred into the flasks the latter were maintained under constant temperature 20 c and mixing speed 200 rpm throughout the tests a blank bottle without adsorbent was also prepared and kept under the abovementioned conditions this control bottle was used to obtain the initial ibp concentration and to verify that no contamination or degradation of ibp solutions occurred during the kinetic experiments the ph of the flasks was monitored the sampling was done at different intervals for a minimum of 5 days after the sample s filtering using 45 μm pore size membrane filters the absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 222 nm via uv spectrophotometry through the shimadzu uv 1800 uv visible scanning spectrophotometer the obtained absorbance values were then converted into concentrations based on the realized calibration curves from 0 to 100 mg l ibp solutions using eq 1 1 c t k abs where ct is the concentration at the time t mg l k is the conversion factor and abs is the measured absorbance value the amount of ibp adsorbed was quantified by using eq 2 2 q t c o c t m v where qt is the adsorbed amount of ibp at time t by the mass of adsorbent mg g 1 c0 and ct are the ibp concentrations at t0 and t mg l respectively m is the adsorbent amount g and v is the solution volume l 2 3 2 kinetics modeling subsequently the experimental data were fitted using minitab to the four most common kinetic models including the pseudo first order pfo or lagergren model 48 pseudo second order pso kinetic model 49 elovich model 50 and the intraparticle diffusion ipd model so called weber and morris ipd model 51 the nonlinear forms of these models

external surface area and activation energy of adsorption or chemisorption g mg ki is the ipd rate constant mg g h0 5 and ci is the initial adsorption related to the thickness of the boundary layer mg g 1 when kinetics are driven purely by ipd the linear plot qt in function of t0 5 is expected to pass through the origin ci 0 however in the majority of the studies it is not the case ci 0 when ci is negative film diffusion and surface reaction control are combined therefore multilinearity or non linearity is encountered and multiple mechanisms control the process as a result these rate limiting processes may be divided into several separate linear data sections over time where they exert control over the entire process the slope and intercept of the regression line are used to get the values of ki and ci respectively ci can determine the thickness of the boundary layer with a high ci value the boundary layer s influence is more significant in the sorption nonlinear or linear regression approaches can be used for kinetic or isotherm modeling 52 the former system is based on an iterative method relying on the use of computer software to estimate the parametric data in nonlinear regression models the best fit model is selected based on the vicinity of their respective coefficient of determination adjusted r2 to unity as well as the lower value of the sum of the square of the errors sse calculated using eq 7 53 however the nearer the values of r2 to unity the better the fit of the linear regression model 31 the linear regression model is inherently flawed by variations in the y axis for the linear form of the adsorption isotherm models leading to plots comparison with different ordinates prone to errors therefore using the nonlinear form of the models allows for overcoming this problem owing to the uniform y axis 7 sse i 1 n q i exp q i mod 2 where qi exp and qi mod are the adsorption capacities obtained from the experimental data and kinetic model respectively and n is the number of data points 2 3 3 isotherms experiments to follow the distribution of adsorbate between the solid and liquid phases at equilibrium adsorption isotherm tests were performed using the same kinetic conditions ibp solution 50 mg l 20 c and 200 rpm while varying the masses of rt bc and rt sabc in a range from 0 1 to 1 g different ratios of adsorbate adsorbent in each bottle the test was conducted until reaching the solid liquid equilibrium at this stage the sampling and analysis were performed the amount of ibp adsorbed at equilibrium was evaluated using the following formula 8 q e c o c e m v where qe is the adsorbed amount of ibp per gram of adsorbent at equilibrium mg g 1 c0 and ce are the ibp concentrations at t0 and equilibrium respectively mg l m is the adsorbent amount in g and v is the solution volume in l 2 3 4 isotherms modeling isotherms provide valuable insights for porous solids characterization and industrial adsorption process design four isotherms models were used to fit the experimental data namely freundlich 54 langmuir 55 sips or langmuir freundlich 56 and temkin 57 models the nonlinear forms of these models are described in

heterogeneity adsorption is regarded as favorable when 0 1 nf 1 irreversible at 1 nf 1 and unfavorable when the ratio is higher than 1 for the langmuir model the nature of the adsorption favorable or unfavorable depends on langmuir s dimensionless factor or equilibrium parameter rl the adsorption is considered irreversible if rl 0 favorable when 0 rl 1 linear when rl 1 and unfavorable if rl is higher than 1 this parameter could be computed using eq 13 13 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c0 is the adsorbate s initial concentration mg l and kl l mg is the langmuir constant 2 4 fixed bed adsorption test following the preliminary kinetic and isotherm adsorption tests a fixed bed adsorption study was performed to investigate the behavior of rt sabc in dynamic operation the fixed bed adsorption test was conducted in a glass column having a length of 45 cm and an internal diameter of 1 5 cm the column was filled with 6 5 g of rt sabc 0 5 φ 1 6 mm up to 30 cm glass wool fibers were inserted in the lower and upper parts of the bed to guarantee good compaction of the bed while avoiding dead volumes and channeling before experimenting rt sabc was washed with deionized water for impurities elimination until steady state flow conditions were established consequently the influent solution of ibp 25 mg l was pumped continuously at a volumetric flow rate of 0 23 ml min using a peristaltic pump fig 1 an up flow feeding method was adopted to manage the flow rate better and counteract the dispersion through advection before this experiment the column was filled with dry rt sabc then deionized water was pumped into the column at 0 23 ml min the time laps between the beginning of the pumping and the saturation of the column were measured as so called the hydraulic residence time the void volume was calculated subsequently the porosity of the column was calculated by dividing the void volume by the total volume of the column the bed porosity was computed to be 64 and the actual hydraulic residence time was equal to 2 53 h during the experiment duration analytical monitoring was performed for this portions of the effluents were collected at three heights 10 20 and 30 cm in a quartz cuvette 3 5 ml until reaching a constant concentration over time the effluents were analyzed at regular intervals by uv vis spectrophotometry at the wavelength of 222 nm the obtained absorbance was corrected based on the realized calibration curve from 0 to 100 mg l ibp solutions the breakthrough curves from the three sampling heights have been obtained by plotting c c0 effluent to influent concentration ratio versus the operating time t the breakthrough curves provide insight into the times of breakthrough tb and saturation ts of the column the breakthrough point is the instant at which the outlet concentration attains a specified percentage of the inlet concentration this percentage commonly between 5 and 10 may be based on legal threshold values or an operator specified limit 58 in fixed bed systems determining the breakthrough point is crucial as it defines the effluent volume that could be treated since no maximum limit was settled for releasing ibp in the environment a rate of 5 c c0 0 05 was considered to delineate the breakthrough time the saturation or exhaustion time was considered at c c0 0 95 the total adsorption capacity of the bed at saturation denoted qs mg g 1 was obtained from the area above the breakthrough curves using the following formula 14 q s q c 0 a s m q c 0 m 0 t s 1 c t c 0 ⅆ t where q is the influent flow rate l h c0 is the influent ibp concentration mg l as is the area above the breakthrough curve m is the quantity of adsorbent inserted in the column g ct is the effluent ibp concentration at a time t mg l and ts is the saturation time h similarly the adsorption capacity at the breakthrough point denoted qb mg g 1 was calculated as follows 15 q b q c 0 a b m q c 0 m 0 t b 1 c t c 0 ⅆ t the total removal efficiency y of the column at ts was computed using the following formula 16 y q c 0 a s q c 0 t s 100 a s t s 100 for the analysis of the breakthrough curves proper parameters are computed including the fraction of bed utilization fbu the empty bed contact time ebct the adsorbent usage rate ur and the length of the used bed known as the mass transfer zone mtz as follows 17 fbu q b q s t b a s 18 ecbt v c q 19 u r m v b 20 mtz h 1 q b q s h 1 t b t s where vc is the volume of the column l vb is the volume of effluent treated at the breakthrough time l and h is the fixed bed height cm the ebct is a measurement of adsorbate adsorbent interaction and impacts the influent volume treated and the shape of the breakthrough curve 59 the mtz value indicates the active bed surface where adsorption occurred while fbu denotes the percentage of the column used for the adsorption 60 the number of bed volumes nbv was evaluated by dividing the volume of treated effluent up to the breakthrough point by the volume of the fixed bed 59 this adsorption parameter is dimensionless and is computed using the following expression 21 nbv volume of effluent treated up to breakthrough point volume of the bed 2 4 1 breakthrough curves fitting models to assess the influence of bed height on the adsorbent efficiency three analytical models namely yoon and nelson s model 61 clark model 62 and thomas model 63 were used to fit the experimental breakthrough curves the nonlinear equations are the following 22 c c 0 1 1 ⅇ k yn τ t 23 c c 0 1 1 a ⅇ rt 1 n f 1 24 c c 0 1 1 ⅇ k t q t m q k t c 0 t where c is the

q is the volumetric flow rate l h 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbents 3 1 1 physico chemical properties table s1 summarizes the elemental analysis results and the textural properties of rt bc and rt sabc after the steam activation process the c content increased while the h n and o decreased this considerable decline in the oxygen fraction is explained by the decomposition of the oxygen containing functional groups located on the biochar surface throughout both calcination and activation processes 64 furthermore the decrease in o content and increase in c content resulted in a lower polarity index o n c of the rt sabc 64 66 besides the loss of functional groups after steam activation resulted in high aromaticity of rt sabc h c 0 1 compared to rt bc h c 0 4 64 65 67 similarly the low n content in rt sabc is mainly attributed to the degradation of n containing compounds between 550 c and 850 c pyrolysis as well as the reactions occurring between nitrogenous functional groups and water and or oxygenated compounds steam activation 64 the ash content increased due to volatile components thermal degradation and the concentration of minerals in the solid phase 3 1 2 textural properties regarding textural properties the bet specific surface area of the rt sabc 710 15 m2 g 1 was almost doubled compared to that of rt bc 375 15 m2 g 1 this higher surface area is potentially due to the development of pores throughout the activation particularly micropores inside the activated char structure 65 the rt sabc surface area falls in good agreement with the values obtained for different physically steam activated carbons derived from biomass reported in the literature for ibp removal coconut shell steam activated carbon 726 m2 g 1 12 physically steam activated wood 899 m2 g 1 68 and date stone steam activated biochar 513 m2 g 1 69 the total pore volume of rt bc and rt sabc was observed to be 0 2093 cm3 g 1 and 0 3362 cm3 g 1 respectively corresponding to an increase of 160 after activation therefore rt sabc exhibits a better porous structure formation on its surface for ibp uptake because of its greater surface area and the significant pores volume rt bc micropores accounted for 65 5 of the total pores volume while mesopores were minorly present 10 however rt sabc micropores and mesopores represented 72 0 and 16 2 of the total pores volume respectively the reason is that steam was proven to drive the opening of clogged pores and the creation of new pores through the elimination of the c atoms from inside the solid carbon network disruption of the chemical skeleton and formation of porous structure at the surface 70 this increase in mesopores volume positively influences the adsorption mechanism contributing to easier ibp adsorption mesopores transport pores act as channels for micropores allowing more micropores to be available for the sorption of the adsorbate in the structure of the carbons 71 3 1 3 atr ftir of adsorbents to identify the functional groups located at the adsorbent s surface as they may considerably impact the adsorption process the ftir spectra of rt bc and rt sabc were analyzed in the wavelength range 400 to 4000 cm 1 the average atr ftir spectra are depicted in fig 2 in the wavenumber regions 4000 2400 cm 1 fairly small peak intensities were noticed for both sorbents the bands in the range 3300 3700 may be attributed to nh stretch vibration in amine and amide while the bands between 3200 and 3400 cm 1 are generally assigned to the oh stretching vibration of hydroxylic groups both bands seem less intensive for rt sabc confirming the loss of nitrogen and oxygenated functional groups after steam activation as found by the elemental analysis for rt bc peaks between 2800 and 3000 cm 1 are attributed to ch stretching vibrations in alkane and alkyl structures these peaks disappeared for rt sabc due to the volatilization of hydrogen during steam activation 72 two broad peaks were found in the region 2100 2380 cm 1 and linked to cco stretching in ketene groups 73 the first broadband was overlapped for both adsorbents with a peak at 2280 cm 1 however the second broadband 2150 2030 cm 1 was slightly shifted to lower values with a maximum peak of 2115 cm 1 the intensity of this second peak was higher for rt sabc due to the formation of more ketene groups during the activation a small fraction of the peak at 2242 cm 1 is assigned to the cn stretching of acrylic fibers acrylonitrile 74 the broad band observed between 1950 and 1640 cm 1 for rt sabc is more extensive than that of rt bc the peaks centered at 1800 cm 1 for rt sabc and 1700 cm 1 for rt bc can be assigned to the co stretching vibration related to ketone aldehyde ester polyester and or carboxylic acid groups both spectra presented a peak in the range of 1640 and 1400 cm 1 nevertheless the peak was remarkably more intense for rt bc than rt sabc as it is assigned to different functional groups for rt bc the peak at 1556 cm 1 is attributed to ch aliphatic stretching groups originating from cellulose degradation for rt sabc the peak at 1505 cm 1 is linked to the cc stretching vibration of aromatic rings after hydrogen volatilization the strong peaks for rt bc between 1220 and 1050 cm 1 are associated with co stretching in asymmetric aromatic ester coh and ether coc groups characteristic peaks of hemicellulose pyranose ring cellulose and polyesters 74 these peaks disappeared after the treatment as the material underwent depolymerization at a high temperature the large peak at 900 1050 cm 1 centered at 1020 cm 1 for rt bc may be assigned to phosphine and phosphine oxides stretching vibration this indicates that phosphorus containing flame retardants or additives could be introduced during the fabrication of the rt panels this peak is smaller for rt sabc owing to the reaction of these functional groups with water at high temperatures resulting in the formation of phosphoric acid and hydrogen during the steam activation 75 76 the peaks between 800 and 600 cm 1 and attributed to ch bending vibration in aromatics deformation bands out of plane seem to disappear after steam activation while the peaks in the lower region 600 400 cm 1 are common to both adsorbents 3 1 4 ph point of zero charge to complete the characterization the phpzc of both adsorbents was determined this parameter depends on the chemical and electronic properties of the functional groups and it is a good indicator of these properties the values of the phpzc of the rt bc and rt sabc were equal to 8 9 and 10 respectively these latter values indicate that negatively charged basic oxygenated groups dominate the surface of both studied adsorbents thus electrostatic attraction and h bonding could take place between ibp and the adsorbents when the ph of the solution is between the pka and phpzc pkaibp ph phpzc moreover the high phpzc values of both adsorbents might be attributed to the tremendous amounts of carbonyl groups pka 16 20 at their surface as described by guedidi et al 42 the atr ftir results confirm the presence of more carbonyl groups at the surface of the rt sabc thus proving the higher basicity of its surface 3 2 batch adsorption study 3 2 1 kinetics study and modeling to determine the equilibrium time and to elucidate the adsorption mechanism adsorption kinetics were investigated in deionized water besides the sorption rate information is relevant to the design and eventual scaling up of experiments realized at the laboratory scale such information is obtained by fitting the experimental data to specific kinetic models the kinetic performance and modeling of ibp on the 500 mg rt bc in batch mode conditions 50 mg l ibp solution 20 c and 250 rpm are displayed in fig 3a the results highlight that the adsorption capacity of the rt bc is limited to 4 17 mg g 1 removal efficiency of 5 3 therefore this adsorbent is inefficient for removing ibp from aqueous solutions the total equilibrium time corresponding to the appearance of the plateau was reached after 24 h the adsorption kinetic was fast in the first stage 8 h followed by a gradual occupation of the binding sites until achieving a steady state this fast kinetic was detected owing to the biochar s high macroporosity 30 similar results were obtained by álvarez torrellas et al 9 investigating the ibp adsorption onto multi walled carbon nanotubes macroporous materials therefore the textural properties of the adsorbent have a substantial evidence impact on ibp removal simultaneously the ph of the solution was measured throughout the kinetic experiments the obtained value ph 7 0 5 was higher than ibp pk a but lower than the phpzc of rt bc this ph value indicates that the target adsorbate is deprotonated ibp in the solution and that the biochar surface is positively charged consequently ibp adsorption is favorable owing to the electrostatic interaction between the adsorptive anion and dominated positively charged groups at the biochar surface generally in this zone repulsive effects are slightly active 77 however this low adsorption capacity could be attributed to the surface chemistry high polarity of the rt bc causing lower affinity towards ibp and higher affinity towards water molecules three models namely pfo pso and elovich were used to model the experimental kinetic data the parameters of these models are summarized in table 2 the results showed that pfo highest r2 0 9793 and lowest sse 0 0999 kinetic model explains better the ibp adsorption over rt bc closely followed by the pso r2 0 9673 therefore physisorption controls the kinetics of the adsorption the primary mechanisms involved could be hydrophobic interactions weak van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding the qe for rt bc was established to be 3 9 mg g 1 according to the pfo model closely matching the experimental value as the removal of ibp by rt bc was very low this adsorbent did not seem to exhibit good adsorptive performance towards ibp removal from water thus it has been neglected in the following steps similarly batch adsorption tests were performed on 0 5 g sieved rt sabc fig 3b displays the experimental and modeled kinetics obtained with this adsorbent the plot shows an initial fast stage in which the majority of the active sites are free followed by a progressively decreasing readily available sites stage in the end the adsorption is noticed to continue at a very slow rate up to 42 95 mg g 1 removal efficiency of about 52 5 the graph shows that the kinetic is far from reaching a steady state 96 h thus the equilibrium time was considered to be about 120 h this slowest ibp adsorption kinetic could be attributed to the higher micropore volume of the rt sabc at the ph of the solution ph 10 0 5 under these conditions ph pka and ph phpzc 0 5 the ibp sorption rate is reduced because of electrostatic attraction and repulsion occurring between ibp and the less positively and more negatively charged rt sabc surface however electron donor acceptor interaction a specific non covalent force between ibp π acceptors and the aromatic benzene rings π donors of rt sabc exists throughout the entire ph range even at high ph 78 79 the matching of the experimental data with the elovich model is noticeable this result is confirmed by the predicted adsorption kinetic data of the elovich model highest r2 0 9984 and lowest sse 0 4964 followed by the pso model r2 0 9835 shown in table 2 the matching with the elovich model indicates that the kinetics is governed by chemisorption second order and that the adsorbent surface is energetically heterogeneous 80 the chemisorption reveals the sharing or exchange of electrons by valence forces between ibp and rt sabc 5 from the predicted parameters the ibp adsorption initial rate represented by the elovich parameter α was equal to 17 418 mg g 1 h 1 and the number of sites available for adsorption was equal to 8 however the elovich model does not provide the adsorption capacity at equilibrium this parameter was obtained from the pso model and was evaluated to be around 43 mg g 1 to understand the adsorption behavior of the first hour t 1 h the ibp adsorption amount was calculated 1 β ln αβ and was found equal to 6 26 mg g 1 accounting for around 15 of the total ibp adsorption therefore the elovich model explains better the adsorption processes onto sieved rt sabc and forecasts an infinite adsorption capacity over a long period of time these results are in agreement with a previous study investigating the ibp adsorption on chemically surface modified activated carbon cloths 42 moreover the weber and morris intraparticle diffusion model was applied to investigate the adsorption mechanism this model is consistent and describes well the adsorption of ibp onto rt bc and rt sabc adsorbents fig 4 depicts the ipd model plot representing the adsorption capacity over time qt as a function of t1 2 for the 500 mg rt sabc and rt bc the obtained multi linear graph could be divided into three phases the regression equations of the three step model are summarized in table 3 the first phase characterizes the fast and instantaneous adsorption or the adsorption at the external surface for up to 7 h with the highest ipd adsorption rate parameter kp1 8 3320 for rt sabc and kp1 1 2589 for rt bc at this stage the plot passes through the origin indicating the absence of a boundary layer and the control of the adsorption rate by intraparticle diffusion the adsorption regression in the second phase gradually decreases kp2 4 4066 for rt sabc and kp2 0 3610 for rt bc which is typical for ibp transport within the inner adsorbent surface for about 25 h the third step is the final equilibrium adsorption phase in which adsorbate moves from macropores and mesopores to micropores at this latter stage ipd is decelerating kp3 2 2804 for rt sabc and kp3 0 0703 for rt bc owing to the low ibp concentrations in the solutions the regression in the second and third phases is also linear still it does not pass through the origin indicating that ipd does not solely control the adsorption rate determining mechanism 3 2 2 isotherm study and modeling in deionized water to describe the interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent adsorption isotherms are critical particularly for design purposes 72 the four models freundlich langmuir sips and temkin were applied to fit the experimental isotherm data 3 2 2 1 rt bc fig 5 shows the adsorption isotherm of ibp onto the tested rt bc adsorbent accordingly the maximum adsorption uptake was around 3 5 mg g 1 at equilibrium after 24 h one of the reasons for this low adsorption capacity could be the low adsorbent porosity particularly the undeveloped mesoporous structure due to the low presence of mesopores the access of ibp to adsorbent micropores is impeded by capillary effects 43 this isotherm can be classified as an s shape isotherm more precisely the s 3 subtype of giles classification 81 this isotherm shape indicates multilayer adsorption 82 83 in which a gradual vertical filling of the adsorbate on the available adsorption sites is taking place 81 the average pore size of rt bc diameter 2 14 nm and width 0 52 nm is close to ibp molecular dimensions 1 03 0 5 0 43 nm allowing a vertical packing of ibp onto the carbonaceous pores this pore filling mechanism could have contributed to this ibp uptake 9 31 84 the curve displays a small slope at the beginning with a plateau reached at an aqueous concentration of 45 mg l followed by a sharp rise of ibp adsorption onto the subsequent monolayers no limited sorption capacity is shown for the rt bc 85 the small exhibited plateau indicates the completion of the monolayer however it does not necessarily imply the ordering in a close packed layer of the adsorbate similar isotherm trends were found in previous studies involving the adsorption of ibp onto multi walled nanotubes 9 the adsorption of polar and nonpolar organic compounds onto carbon nanotubes 84 and the removal of diuron from water using activated carbon 86 comparable low ibp adsorption capacities have been reported in the literature using different raw biochars from wood and agricultural residues table s2 the surface chemistry of the adsorbent plays an essential role in the adsorption of ibp 9 according to the adsorption isotherm the s type profile reveals that water molecules compete with ibp for the binding sites of the sorbent 87 as the surface polarity of the rt bc is higher than the rt sabc because of the greater active hydrophilic sites oxygenated compounds on the rt bc surface fig 6a and b water molecules aggregation occurs these clusters bound to the carbon hydrophilic pores impede the accessibility of ibp hydrophobic drug to the surface of the sorbent 88 89 similar conclusions have been made by karanfil and kilduff 90 these authors have reported that numerous functional groups containing oxygen at the adsorbent surface or a high quantity of polar oxygen molecules in the carbon matrix improve the sorbent surface polarity and their selectivity for water besides several studies have demonstrated that oxidized sorbent surfaces exhibit reduced uptake of organic contaminants 91 93 and an enhanced uptake for polar adsorbates 94 none of the four isotherms models was able to fit the experimental points other isotherm models such as the bet model could potentially fit these points as the removal capacity was extremely low this adsorbent did not seem suitable for ibp removal hence it was no more considered for further experiments 3 2 2 2 rt sabc the experimental and modeled adsorption isotherms of ibp onto rt sabc adsorbent in distilled water are shown in fig 7 at equilibrium the maximum adsorption uptake was around 53 9 mg g 1 this value is much lower than that obtained with activated carbon cloth 492 mg g 1 having a very high surface area 1910 m2 g 1 this isotherm can be classified as an l shape isotherm more precisely the l 3 subtype of giles classification 81 denoting the progressive saturation of the active sites during adsorption it could be clearly seen that the temkin and freundlich nonlinear regression models poorly described the adsorption process whereas the best fitting of the experimental data is achieved by langmuir r2 0 9521 and sse 2 2513 and freundlich langmuir r2 0 9543 and sse 3 2394 isotherms the same findings were described by guedidi et al 42 on modified activated cloths rl and 1 n parameters of the langmuir and sips models were calculated the computed values rl 0 02 and 1 n 0 98 fall between 0 and 1 these rl and 1 n values indicate a favorable adsorption process close to irreversible adsorption rl 0 and 1 n 1 thus the adsorption process shows a monolayer profile on the energetically heterogeneous adsorbent surface without interactions between the adsorbate and the adsorbent the calculated constant parameters of the four models along with their r2 and sse values are reported in table 4 the surface chemistry and textural properties high adsorbent porosity could be behind the higher adsorption uptake 54 mg g 1 of ibp molecules onto the steam activated adsorbent when comparing the maximum adsorption uptake of this rt sabc to other sorbents derived from several types of waste table s3 this equilibrium capacity falls in the low to medium range of steam activated carbons adsorbing ibp 3 3 fixed bed adsorption study fixed bed adsorption test considers the adsorption dynamics to forecast operational characteristics such as the capacity of the adsorbent the adsorption in columns guarantees continuous contact between the adsorbent and the pollutant in treating aqueous solutions on a large scale this method enables efficient treatment of greater pollutant loads and guarantees that the adsorbate is constantly in direct contact with a fresh adsorbent 3 3 1 effect of bed height fig 8 shows the breakthrough curves obtained for the adsorption of ibp using different bed heights 10 20 and 30 cm in a fixed bed column under constant inlet concentration 25 mg l temperature 20 c and volumetric flow rate 0 22 ml min as the plots display the breakthrough curves are shifted to the right with increasing the bed depth both breakthrough and exhaustion times increased with increasing bed height for bed heights 10 20 and 30 cm the breakthrough times were around 2 8 and 20 days while saturation points were partially reached after 16 28 and 42 days respectively this partial saturation of the bed was explained by the superior contribution of microporosity in the adsorption process hindering the access of ibp molecules to all rt sabc inner pores similarly the effluent treated volume until breakthrough and saturation were increased for higher bed heights under a constant flow rate and feed concentration the volume of solution treated at breakthrough time for h 10 20 and 30 cm was about 0 6 2 5 and 6 4 l while it reached 6 9 and 13 5 l at saturation respectively moreover the breakthrough curves presented a flatter and tailing profile with comparatively less steep tendencies for higher bed heights shifting away from the origin reflecting a non ideal transport within the pores the above observations were also obtained by álvarez torrellas et al 9 for fixed bed adsorption of ibp on a microporous material f400 activated carbon the breakthrough curves for 20 and 30 cm heights were more or less symmetrical however for h 10 cm the curve was intensely sharp and asymmetrical attributed mainly to a not fully developed flow as the bed length is 5 cm shorter than the recommended one 15 cm the useful parameters calculated from the experimental data of the breakthrough curves for the three bed heights are provided in table 5 the maximum equilibrium capacity of the column at breakthrough and saturation increased with the bed height for h 20 and 30 cm the ibp adsorption capacity onto rt sabc at the breakthrough time increased from 15 to 25 mg g 1 while the adsorption capacity at saturation time rose from 28 to 40 mg g 1 respectively the reason is that more activated adsorbents were used for packing higher column heights therefore more active adsorption binding sites are available for capturing ibp molecules resulting in greater contact time to reach saturation 72 the high amount of adsorbent implies sufficient time for ibp to diffuse over the rt sabc pores and the uptake capacity is subsequently raised however the total adsorption capacity in the dynamic mode was lower than in the batch mode possible explanations could include the different residence times in the batch and dynamic experiments along with the stirring conditions in the batch tests that favor external diffusion as the adsorbents and adsorbate move freely in the solution hence better interactions between active adsorbent sites and adsorbate molecules occur similar results were reported by feizi et al 88 using tire based activated carbon for the removal of pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions another reason for adsorption capacity is the lower ibp to the available adsorption sites ratio as demonstrated by chen et al 67 corroborating the above observation all the parameters including ebct fbu mtz and nbv increased with the bed depth table 5 similarly ibp removal efficiency y increased from 37 to 74 when the depth was raised from 10 to 30 cm therefore a more extended bed height column is favored for better column performance 3 3 2 modeling of the breakthrough curves the modeling of the breakthrough curves is essential for the successful design and operation of the fixed bed column therefore three empirical models namely clark thomas and yoon nelson were used to analyze and fit the experimental breakthrough points by nonlinear regression using minitab the predicted breakthrough curves by these models eqs 22 24 are illustrated in fig 8 for the different bed heights and the model s parameters are depicted in table 6 the results showed that the clark model had the highest r2 coefficient 0 9860 0 9845 and the lowest sse 0 0448 0 0244 for the bed lengths of 10 20 cm reflecting its best correlation with the experimental data for the height of 30 cm all three models fit exceptionally well the observed data as presented by the same highest r2 value of 0 9985 and the lowest sse of 0 0027 thus confirming the superimposed curves regarding the parameters the predicted value for the maximum adsorption uptake determined by the thomas model is qt 40 0445 mg g 1 quite similar to the experimental calculated one additionally the yoon nelson model predicts the 50 of fixed bed saturation which was equal to 756 h very close to the experimental one 758 9 h this time required for 50 breakthrough increased from 119 to 756 h with bed depth increased from 10 to 30 cm due to the increase in loading capacity 59 this is also corroborated by the decrease in model rate constant k yn due to delayed breakthrough time the rate constants of the yoon nelson and thomas kyn and kt decreased with increasing the bed height owing to delayed breakthrough times considering the results of the fixed bed adsorption column the thomas and clark models could be successfully applied to describe the breakthrough curves of ibp onto the rt sabc these models are based on the second order reversible reaction kinetics langmuir equilibrium isotherm thomas model and freundlich isotherm clark model both models consider the fixed bed column as a plug flow reactor with a negligible contribution to the dispersion phenomenon similarly previous studies have confirmed the better application of thomas and or yoon nelson models on ibp adsorption in columns using nano adsorbent clay 33 zirconium allied alginate beads 95 and raspberry mesoporous carbon 96 3 3 3 adsorption mechanism the mechanism of adsorption taking place in the elimination of ibp by rt sabc was examined using atr ftir before and after the adsorption of the pharmaceutical molecule this spectroscopic analysis has revealed valuable information about the exact functional groups and the locations of the chemical bonds involved in the chemical interaction 97 the spectra are displayed in fig 9 accordingly the functional groups at the rt sabc surface were noticed to be involved in ibp adsorption due to the apparent variations in the intensity of several peaks a slightly higher intensity band was detected in the region 3400 3800 cm 1 indicating the involvement of amide groups located at the rt sabc surface in ibp adsorption similar observations were reported by dubey et al 98 confirming the dipolar interaction between amide groups and ibp the removal of ibp could have occurred via the formation of a six membered stable ring moreover a slight increment in the peaks intensity between 2800 and 3000 cm 1 ch stretching in alkane and alkyl and 2100 2380 cm 1 cco stretching in ketenes was noticed on the other hand a weakening of the intensity of the peaks between 1900 and 1640 cm 1 co ketones aldehyde ester and carboxylic acids 1640 1400 cm 1 cc stretching of aromatic rings and 1100 800 cm 1 co stretching in ester and ether was observed after adsorption the interactions between ibp and the functional groups of rt sabc and the shielding effect of the ibp drug could be responsible for this weakening 99 the masking of carboxylic peaks confirmed the chemical complexation between ibp molecules and rt sabc 100 3 4 competitive adsorption study the degree of removal of a target adsorbate from aqueous matrices among co pollutants depends primarily on the ionization and surface charges of the adsorbent the adsorption capacity and affinity of adsorbents during ibp removal are concurrently impacted by the existence of ions in the solution and or other micropollutants understanding these properties is critical in adsorption technology as they produce effects such as electrostatic salting out filtering and aggregation at sorbent sorbate interfaces 31 several authors have demonstrated that water chemistry including ph and inorganic constituents e g na ca2 mg2 k cl so4 2 no3 hco3 impacts the adsorption of pharmaceuticals 79 101 103 the adsorption process of ibp ph 8 5 and c0 2 mg l was improved by 43 16 2 and 1 in the presence of ca2 so4 2 mg2 and k respectively 79 qiu et al 102 and xu et al 103 have observed a positive influence of electrolyte ions and salinity on organic pollutants adsorption on different biochars owing to increased ionic strength in the solution the presence of cations in the water neutralizes the negative charges on the biochar surface effectively weakening the electrostatic repulsion forces between the biochar surface and the ibp 79 102 104 other studies have demonstrated that numerous pharmaceuticals form complex compounds with divalent cations ca2 and mg2 105 these complexes can be neutral or positively charged raising the interaction with the negatively charged sorbent surface rich in carboxyl groups therefore ca2 ions strongly bind with the carboxylic groups resulting in less electrostatic repulsion and higher removal efficiency 79 106 preliminary kinetic and isotherm experiments were performed using tap water drinking water to investigate the ibp adsorption onto rt sabc and the synergistic impact of non target mineral salts on the adsorption process the composition of the tap water used in these experiments is presented in table s4 107 the ph of the solution was found to be 9 0 2 throughout the tap water experiment the solution ph is an essential parameter for adsorption control 5 101 108 the presence of salts and electrolyte ions water constituents reduced the solution ph and improved the ibp adsorption kinetics and isotherm under this ph condition phpka ibp ph phpzc rt sabc thus electrostatic repulsion forces are reduced and electrostatic attraction forces are enhanced between the positively charged rt sabc surface and the anionic ibp although the slow kinetic adsorption of ibp hydrophobic compounds in tap water the equilibrium was far from being reached after 198 h 8 days as presented in fig 10 the adsorption uptake in tap water reached 53 11 mg g 1 after 48 h removal efficiency of 72 65 8 mg g 1 after 120 h removal efficiency of 83 and 73 8 mg g 1 after 198 h removal efficiency of 93 in tap water since the adsorption is noticed to continue progressively at a very slow rate after 120 h the equilibrium time was considered to be about 120 h consequently the kinetic adsorption tests in tap water revealed better ibp removal onto rt sabc than in deionized water similar observations were reported by yaqubi et al that have shown a higher removal percentage of amoxicillin in tap water 72 than in distilled water 62 after 24 h using leached carbon black waste chitosan beads 107 the adsorption of ibuprofen exhibited pronounced ph dependence indeed ibuprofen is a hydrophobic compound and thus would occupy faster the active pore sites of the adsorbent therefore little or no competition would exist between ionized molecules hydrophilic and ibp on the adsorbent sites similar observations were reported by jung et al 101 the experimental equilibrium adsorption amounts q e were calculated using the same kinetic conditions while varying the weight of the crushed rt sabc between 0 05 and 1 g in tap water fig 11 after 120 h the maximum adsorption uptake was 60 mg g 1 15 greater than that obtained with the same adsorbent in deionized water therefore the increase in ionic strength exhibited a positive effect on ibp adsorption 3 5 spent adsorbent disposal the proper disposal of the used adsorbents is strongly recommended because of the environmental issues involved indeed unsafe disposal of spent adsorbents can lead to increasing environmental pollution due to the formation of secondary pollutants leaching into soil and contaminating groundwater 12 109 according to the world health organization who directive entitled guidelines for safe disposal of unwanted pharmaceuticals in and after emergencies adsorbents loaded with ibuprofen can be safely disposed of following the recommended disposal techniques for pharmaceuticals 5 109 the adsorption of ibuprofen onto rt sabc is nearly irreversible this suggests that ibp once adsorbed can neither diffuse along nor desorb from the sorbent surface the ibp laden rt sabc has a high calorific value 30 mj kg it can be used as an alternative to coal and be incinerated for energy recovery or gasified for the production of syngas 45 other proper disposal processes reported in the literature include waste immobilization by encapsulation chemical decomposition or firing in open containers 5 12 4 conclusions this study investigated the possibility of valorizing biochar and steam activated biochar derived from recycled textiles insulation panels at end of life as adsorbents for removing ibuprofen from aqueous systems from this work the following conclusions can be made the microporous biochar had fast kinetics and the experimental data were best fitted to the pseudo first order model the biochar exhibited a multilayer isotherm profile with a low maximum adsorption capacity of 4 mg g 1 removal efficiency of 5 3 owing to the clustering of water molecules and blocking carbon hydrophilic pores the microporous and mesoporous steam activated biochar had slow kinetics and the elovich model best fitted the data the adsorption isotherm showed a monolayer profile with high maximum adsorption uptake of 54 mg g 1 at equilibrium removal efficiency 50 after steam activation the higher surface area and developed pores are behind the greater ibp adhesion sips and langmuir s models better explained the adsorption of ibp onto the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent the weber and morris model adequately fitted the ibp adsorption onto both adsorbents in the fixed bed column increasing the bed height increases the breakthrough time and adsorption capacity 40 mg g 1 at saturation the higher mass of activated adsorbents and more active binding sites resulted in higher contact time with depth the results of the dynamic test agreed with the batch experiments this continuous system treated 6 4 l of effluent volume at breakthrough and 13 5 l at saturation for a height of 30 cm clark thomas and yoon nelson s models best fitted the experimental breakthrough curves atr ftir spectra before and after the adsorption elucidated that amide ketone aldehyde ester ether carboxylic acid and aromatic ring groups seemed to be involved in the mechanism of adsorption of ibuprofen by the steam activated biochar preliminary experiments in tap water on crushed steam activated biochar showed an improved ibp removal efficiency 72 after 48 h owing to the reduced solution ph below the phpzc due to salts and ionized molecules in tap water the spent adsorbents can be burnt for energy recovery or gasified for syngas production the steam activated biochar could be an alternative efficient adsorbent for removing ibuprofen from aqueous media to improve the knowledge about ibuprofen adsorption onto both studied adsorbents a complete batch adsorption study should be performed to evaluate the influence of several parameters such as adsorbent dose solution ph temperature agitation speed and initial adsorbate concentration on ibuprofen sorption additionally studies of the sorption thermodynamics and the desorption of ibuprofen for sorbent regeneration should be conducted to determine the degree of reusability of the sorbent or to confirm the irreversibility of the adsorption process future fixed bed adsorption experiments should examine the effects of different operating conditions temperature ph inlet concentration flow rate and contact time on the breakthrough curves and the removal of ibuprofen further characterization of the steam activated biochar boehm titration etc should be investigated to go deeper into the adsorption mechanism of ibp onto the rt sabc surface and to provide a chemical reaction process scheme of the ionic interactions furthermore a techno economic study has to be carried out to find the economic feasibility of the process at an industrial scale also batch and dynamic adsorption tests in real wastewater are desired to be investigated in the future finally further studies should also consider testing the adsorption of other pharmaceutical molecules such as antibiotics or other anti inflammatory drugs onto the studied biochar and activated carbon to determine the selectivity of the

12501,this study explores the potential use of recycled textile biochar rt bc and steam activated biochar rt sabc derived from insulation panels at end of life as sorbents for removing ibuprofen from aqueous solutions after steam activation the surface area and micropore volume increased subsequently kinetic and isotherm experiments were investigated at 20 c 200 rpm and 50 mg l ibuprofen solution equilibrium was reached after 24 h for rt bc and 120 h for rt sabc the kinetics of rt bc and rt sabc followed the pseudo first order and elovich models respectively rt sabc isotherm showed the highest adsorption capacity 53 9 mg g 1 well fitted into the sips model ibuprofen uptake by rt sabc was nearly irreversible afterward rt sabc dynamic performance was evaluated in a fixed bed column for three bed heights the breakthrough point 41 7 476 7 h the volume of effluent treated 0 6 6 4 l at breakthrough and adsorption capacity 22 09 39 81 mg g 1 increased with bed height 10 30 cm thomas and clark s models simulated the experimental points confirming second order kinetics and sips isotherm different functional groups were involved in the adsorption mechanism preliminary experiments in tap water on rt sabc showed a removal 83 due to ionic strength and reduced ph therefore rt sabc could be an efficient adsorbent for ibuprofen removal from aqueous systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords breakthrough curve fixed bed column steam activated biochar ibuprofen textile insulation panel tap water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the detection in surface waters of about 4000 varieties of emerging micro pollutants is becoming a source of concern for the entire population worldwide particularly in europe these emanating compounds commonly exhibit non biodegradability persistence stability hydrophilicity and ubiquity furthermore these contaminants are predominantly prone to bioaccumulation in humans and animals 1 this is the case for pharmaceutical substances including psychiatric drugs lipid regulators beta blockers antibiotics contraceptive hormones and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids after veterinary and human use 2 the primary sources of drugs in aquatic systems are landfill leachates wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents health care facilities and hospitals 3 despite their low concentrations in the environment typically at trace levels 18 to 6297 ng l in the world 4 30 to 6400 ng l in europe 5 the mixture of pharmaceuticals has the potential to be detrimental due to synergetic effects 6 and continuous exposure 7 which is prevalent in aquatic ecosystems 8 ibuprofen ibp is one of the most prescribed and consumed nsaids to relieve pain and fever originating from human excrement and urine as well as from the pharmaceutical industries and hospitals ibp ends up in wwtps 9 this drug could be excreted as an unchanged molecule or as biochemically active metabolites hydroxyl ibp or carboxy ibp 1 that may have more significant toxicity moderate to high than the original molecule particularly on green algae and invertebrates 10 ibp chemically known as 2 4 isobutylphenyl propanoic acid has a pka value of 4 91 thus this drug is weakly acidic and has a poor adsorption tendency onto wwtp sludge 9 therefore residual concentration of this micro contaminant is often encountered in european wwtps effluents and consequently discharged into the environment leading to the pollution of surface water 1 0 to 67 μg l in greece 8 0 μg l in france germany 7 5 μg l finland 16 0 μg l belgium 8 0 μg l 11 etc along with groundwater 3 to 395 ng l in europe 11 the ecotoxicology of ibp has been well examined for comprehending the harmful consequences to human health endocrine disrupting effects 12 and the aquatic environment 13 22 ibp has been found to impact severely marine fauna and flora causing genotoxic acute and chronic effects on fish 16 crustaceans 13 invertebrates 14 17 18 20 algae 15 21 bacteria 22 and plants 19 for all these reasons removing ibp from aquatic environments is of great importance for preserving ecosystems and human health conventional physical chemical or biological treatment processes adopted in wwtps are not sufficiently effective for ibp elimination or degradation because of the drug s moderate water solubility 21 mg l and high polarity 23 the conventional activated sludge process was emphasized to remove pharmaceutical compounds poorly including ibp 24 25 naproxen and ketoprofen 26 from wastewater biological techniques operating under anaerobic or aerobic conditions present poor degradability to some pharmaceutical compounds and the ibp biodegradation requires several days besides the successful technologies available including advanced oxidation processes photocatalysis fenton reaction ozonation etc and advanced treatments adsorption nanofiltration membrane bioreactor etc or hybrid technologies are more efficient for the abatement of ibp but also costly 9 although nanofiltration requires low energy to operate and is efficient for pharmaceutical elimination the membranes are easily prone to fouling 27 moreover advanced oxidation processes are recognized for their mineralization and degradation of highly resistant pollutants however they have high operation investment and energy costs require expensive chemical reagents and form highly toxic oxidative hydroxyl or sulfate radicals throughout the treatment 28 likewise catalytic membrane reactors were reported to be effective for the separation and electrocatalytic degradation of emerging organic pharmaceutical pollutants 29 nevertheless their deployment at a large scale is currently limited owing to the high cost of the electrodes 30 in this context the implementation of adsorption for ibp mitigation has been substantial compared to the aforementioned treatment techniques and has been successfully evaluated throughout the years the reason is that adsorption holds an outstanding ability to get rid of a broad type of pollutants with fast process kinetics 28 another great advantage of the adsorption process is its simplicity of operation low capital cost and high performance besides the adsorption technology enables the feasibility of integrating waste products with little or no potential economic value as well as low cost renewable and sustainable materials 31 32 this includes mainly composites 33 34 clays 35 36 polymers 37 nano adsorbents 34 38 39 non activated waste 40 and activated carbon 41 42 the utilization of cost effective adsorbents for ibp removal has well been reviewed in the literature 31 several studies have examined the ibp adsorption over activated carbon adsorbents derived from agricultural biomass wastes such as olive waste cakes mung bean husk 5 cork powder 41 rice husk 9 coconut shell 12 and olive stone 43 other activated carbon fibers investigated are those derived from chemically modified cloths oxidized by naocl or thermally treated under n2 at 700 c for 1 h 42 the majority of the studies covered batch adsorption tests to evaluate the effectiveness of adsorption as a function of the maximum uptake capacity the dynamic operation in fixed bed columns is usually desired at industrial scale owing to low operational cost and the flexibility of the systems 31 although plenty of investigations have been performed eliminating ibp using sorbents derived from building waste particularly biomass based insulation materials bims at their end of life is not yet explored at present the use of these renewable and energy efficient bims including recycled textile rt fiber panels is emerging these materials deriving from non recyclable denim wastes play an essential role in the circular economy and the transition towards low carbon and sustainable positive energy buildings at their end of life the volume of rt waste is expected to reach 2500 tons year starting from 2050 44 to date the treatment of these rt panels waste is still in its infancy and the panels are projected to end up in landfills by 2050 posing more environmental risks in a previous study we explored that reuse and recycling are hindered by several barriers and that waste to energy conversion techniques are promising strategies for this type of waste 44 in another study the pyrolysis and steam gasification of rt panels was performed it was observed that the rt pyrolysis biochar has a remarkably high specific surface area compared to other biochars hence its use as a sorbent was recommended 45 this study provides insight into the feasibility of applying novel adsorbents namely biochar and steam activated biochar derived from rt insulation panels at end of life to remove ibp from aqueous environments the objective of this work resides in comparing the behavior of both adsorbents as regards their kinetic performance and adsorption capacity in batch and dynamic adsorption experiments first both adsorbents were characterized to determine the influence of steam activation on the adsorbent properties next the ibp adsorption performance was assessed using kinetic and isotherm tests on the studied adsorbents in deionized water to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity at equilibrium a fixed bed adsorption study was then carried out to evaluate the behavior of the steam activated biochar in dynamic operation the effect of the bed height on the adsorption in continuous mode was investigated kinetic isotherm and breakthrough curves were correlated to different models using nonlinear regression analyses to understand better the adsorption mechanism subsequently the functional groups involved in the adsorption mechanism were identified by analyzing the fourier transformed infrared spectra before and after ibp adsorption finally preliminary kinetic and isotherm experiments were performed using tap water to investigate the ibp adsorption and competitivity onto rt sabc in the presence of mineral salts and ions in the solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbate ibuprofen sodium salt was used as the model adsorbate in this study this analytical compound was supplied from sigma aldrich at a purity 98 this adsorbate has been selected as it is moderately to highly soluble in water all the solutions were prepared with deionized water dw without ph adjustment the main physico chemical properties of this pharmaceutical adsorbate are shown in table 1 2 2 adsorbents rt insulation panels were purchased from the local market in france rt panels are composed of shredded textile fibers mixed with low melt polyester fibers spinning of regular and modified polyethylene terephthalate pet the product has been treated with flame retardants 10 8 wt based on organic chemicals and with antifungal products 1 wt including triclosan and octhilinone 45 owing to their low mass density and fibrous nature these panels were manually pelletized using a hydraulic press unit applying a pressure of 5 tons without a binder to form homogeneous pellets afterward the rt pellets were used as raw material to prepare the two adsorbents namely biochar rt bc and steam activated biochar rt sabc for the subsequent experiments 2 2 1 preparation rt bc and rt sabc adsorbents were prepared following the experimental procedure described by rabbat et al 45 rt bc was produced via the pyrolysis of rt pellets in an electrically heated semi rotating inconel reactor under a constant nitrogen flow rate of 750 ml min the reactor was heated at 10 c min up to 550 c and the pyrolysis temperature was maintained for 2 h after cooling the rt bc pellets were recovered and stored in sealed bottles for future analysis on the other hand rt sabc adsorbent was produced via physical activation using steam in the same reactor the activation process was preceded by pyrolysis of raw rt pellets using a heating ramp of 10 c min up to 850 c when the activation temperature was reached the nitrogen flow rate was reduced to 530 ml min then water was introduced into the reactor at 0 7 ml min the activation conditions were held for 1 h at the end of the experiment the reactor is cooled down to room temperature afterward the rt sabc was collected and kept in hermetic flasks for subsequent examination finally both adsorbents were crushed and sieved for powder removal selecting the size fraction granulometry from 0 5 to 0 8 mm for kinetic and isotherm adsorption tests and 0 5 to 1 6 mm for the dynamic column adsorption experiments before their use the adsorbents were washed with deionized water to eliminate potential impurities inside the pores 2 2 2 characterization several analyses were performed to assess both adsorbents chemical and physical properties initially both adsorbents were dried at 105 c for 24 h subsequently the elemental analysis was carried out on powdered adsorbents using a flash ea 1112 series chns o analyzer for the determination of the weight percentages of carbon c hydrogen h nitrogen n and sulfur s the oxygen o content was deduced by difference then the ash contents of the adsorbents were evaluated as the residual mass that remained after burning a triplicate of samples in a muffle furnace maintained at 815 c for 4 h afterward a physisorption unit micromeritic 3flex adsorption analyzer was used to assess the textural properties of the adsorbents using the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k this analysis is preceded by the outgassing of samples under vacuum 30 mmhg at a heating rate of 10 c min up to 350 c that is held for 48 h the brunauer emmett teller bet equation was applied to calculate the specific surface area sbet the total volume of pores vtotal was evaluated by the amount of n2 adsorbed at p p0 0 95 the volume of micropores 2 nm vmicro and the volume of mesopores 2 50 nm vmeso were determined using t plot and bjh barrett joyner halenda methods respectively the adsorption average pore diameter 4 v a was identified in addition the ph drift method was used to determine the ph point of zero charge phpzc of both adsorbents 42 47 in different flasks 50 ml of 0 01 m nacl solution was introduced then the ph of each flask was adjusted to a value ranging from 2 to 12 phinitial through the careful transfer of small quantities of 0 1 m hcl or naoh solutions using a dropper pipette consequently 150 mg of adsorbent was inserted the solution s equilibrium ph phfinal was measured after shaking at room temperature 20 c for five days in the sealed containers after plotting phfinal versus phinitial the point at which no change in the ph has occurred in the presence of the adsorbent corresponds to the phpzc phfinal phinitial a scanning electron microscope sem jeol jsm 5800 lv coupled with a dispersive energy x ray edx spectrometer was utilized to determine the morphology and the mapping of elements at the surfaces of rt sabc and rt bc prior to sem observation samples were coated with a thin layer of platinum 8 nm thickness to improve their conductivity then the analysis was realized under vacuum conditions 10 5 pa with an accelerating voltage of 15 kv and a magnification of 10 000x to investigate the functional groups on the tested adsorbents attenuated total reflection coupled to fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy was used besides this technique allows for identifying the groups involved in ibp adsorption this analysis was performed in duplicates on the adsorbents at room temperature between 400 and 4000 cm 1 to collect specific spectra recognizing different functional organic groups the spectra detect interactions between the drug and the carbonaceous matrix spectra were collected after 32 running scans at a resolution of 4 cm 1 2 3 batch adsorption tests batch adsorption tests involving the kinetic and isotherms experiments were performed for both adsorbents to study their potential removal efficiency of ibp from deionized water and tap water 2 3 1 kinetics experiments kinetic adsorption experiments were realized in an 800 ml volume of ibp solution 50 mg l in the presence of 0 5 g of rt bc or rt sabc to determine the effect of contact time on ibp adsorption despite the presence of ibp in water bodies at a low concentration μg to ng this high concentration 50 mg l was opted to ease the observation of the equilibrium during the batch adsorption experiment equilibrium reaction and the characterization of the added biochar at the end of the experiment this concentration provides more reliable results at the laboratory scale accurate weight measurement 1 mg and a measurable residual concentration of ibp in the solution quantification limit of the uv spectrophotometer with an acceptable error 5 to be able to plot kinetic isotherm and breakthrough curves the samples were prepared using a two step procedure the first step consisted of adding 0 5 g of adsorbent into 400 ml of dw and maintaining the bottles under agitation for 24 h after stabilizing the ph and removing impurities inside the adsorbent s pores 400 ml of ibp solution 100 mg l was transferred into the flasks the latter were maintained under constant temperature 20 c and mixing speed 200 rpm throughout the tests a blank bottle without adsorbent was also prepared and kept under the abovementioned conditions this control bottle was used to obtain the initial ibp concentration and to verify that no contamination or degradation of ibp solutions occurred during the kinetic experiments the ph of the flasks was monitored the sampling was done at different intervals for a minimum of 5 days after the sample s filtering using 45 μm pore size membrane filters the absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 222 nm via uv spectrophotometry through the shimadzu uv 1800 uv visible scanning spectrophotometer the obtained absorbance values were then converted into concentrations based on the realized calibration curves from 0 to 100 mg l ibp solutions using eq 1 1 c t k abs where ct is the concentration at the time t mg l k is the conversion factor and abs is the measured absorbance value the amount of ibp adsorbed was quantified by using eq 2 2 q t c o c t m v where qt is the adsorbed amount of ibp at time t by the mass of adsorbent mg g 1 c0 and ct are the ibp concentrations at t0 and t mg l respectively m is the adsorbent amount g and v is the solution volume l 2 3 2 kinetics modeling subsequently the experimental data were fitted using minitab to the four most common kinetic models including the pseudo first order pfo or lagergren model 48 pseudo second order pso kinetic model 49 elovich model 50 and the intraparticle diffusion ipd model so called weber and morris ipd model 51 the nonlinear forms of these models are described in the following equations eqs 3 6 respectively 3 ⅆ q t ⅆ t k 1 q e q t or q t q e 1 e k 1 t 4 ⅆ q t ⅆ t k 2 q e q t 2 or q e k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t 5 q t 1 β ln αβ 1 β ln t 6 q t k i t

adsorption at equilibrium h 1 k2 is the rate constant of pseudo second order adsorption g mg h α is the initial adsorption rate at t0 1 α β mg g 1 h 1 β is a desorption constant related to the external surface area and activation energy of adsorption or chemisorption g mg ki is the ipd rate constant mg g h0 5 and ci is the initial adsorption related to the thickness of the boundary layer mg g 1 when kinetics are driven purely by ipd the linear plot qt in function of t0 5 is expected to pass through the origin ci 0 however in the majority of the studies it is not the case ci 0 when ci is negative film diffusion and surface reaction control are combined therefore multilinearity or non linearity is encountered and multiple mechanisms control the process as a result these rate limiting processes may be divided into several separate linear data sections over time where they exert control over the entire process the slope and intercept of the regression line are used to get the values of ki and ci respectively ci can determine the thickness of the boundary layer with a high ci value the boundary layer s influence is more significant in the sorption nonlinear or linear regression approaches can be used for kinetic or isotherm modeling 52 the former system is based on an iterative method relying on the use of computer software to estimate the parametric data in nonlinear regression models the best fit model is selected based on the vicinity of their respective coefficient of determination adjusted r2 to unity as well as the lower value of the sum of the square of the errors sse calculated using eq 7 53 however the nearer the values of r2 to unity the better the fit of the linear regression model 31 the linear regression model is inherently flawed by variations in the y axis for the linear form of the adsorption isotherm models leading to plots comparison with different ordinates prone to errors therefore using the nonlinear form of the models allows for overcoming this problem owing to the uniform y axis 7 sse i 1 n q i exp q i mod 2 where qi exp and qi mod are the adsorption capacities obtained from the experimental data and kinetic model respectively and n is the number of data points 2 3 3 isotherms experiments to follow the distribution of adsorbate between the solid and liquid phases at equilibrium adsorption isotherm tests were performed using the same kinetic conditions ibp solution 50 mg l 20 c and 200 rpm while varying the masses of rt bc and rt sabc in a range from 0 1 to 1 g different ratios of adsorbate adsorbent in each bottle the test was conducted until reaching the solid liquid equilibrium at this stage the sampling and analysis were performed the amount of ibp adsorbed at equilibrium was evaluated using the following formula 8 q e c o c e m v where qe is the adsorbed amount of ibp per gram of adsorbent at equilibrium mg g 1 c0 and ce are the ibp concentrations at t0 and equilibrium respectively mg l m is the adsorbent amount in g and v is the solution volume in l 2 3 4 isotherms modeling isotherms provide valuable insights for porous solids characterization and industrial adsorption process design four isotherms models were used to fit the experimental data namely freundlich 54 langmuir 55 sips or langmuir freundlich 56 and temkin 57 models the nonlinear forms of these models are described in the following equations eqs 9 12 respectively 9 q e k f c e 1 n f 10 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e 11 q e q max k s c e 1 n 1 k s c e 1 n 12 q e rt b ln k t c e where kf l g 1 and nf dimensionless are

heterogeneity adsorption is regarded as favorable when 0 1 nf 1 irreversible at 1 nf 1 and unfavorable when the ratio is higher than 1 for the langmuir model the nature of the adsorption favorable or unfavorable depends on langmuir s dimensionless factor or equilibrium parameter rl the adsorption is considered irreversible if rl 0 favorable when 0 rl 1 linear when rl 1 and unfavorable if rl is higher than 1 this parameter could be computed using eq 13 13 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c0 is the adsorbate s initial concentration mg l and kl l mg is the langmuir constant 2 4 fixed bed adsorption test following the preliminary kinetic and isotherm adsorption tests a fixed bed adsorption study was performed to investigate the behavior of rt sabc in dynamic operation the fixed bed adsorption test was conducted in a glass column having a length of 45 cm and an internal diameter of 1 5 cm the column was filled with 6 5 g of rt sabc 0 5 φ 1 6 mm up to 30 cm glass wool fibers were inserted in the lower and upper parts of the bed to guarantee good compaction of the bed while avoiding dead volumes and channeling before experimenting rt sabc was washed with deionized water for impurities elimination until steady state flow conditions were established consequently the influent solution of ibp 25 mg l was pumped continuously at a volumetric flow rate of 0 23 ml min using a peristaltic pump fig 1 an up flow feeding method was adopted to manage the flow rate better and counteract the dispersion through advection before this experiment the column was filled with dry rt sabc then deionized water was pumped into the column at 0 23 ml min the time laps between the beginning of the pumping and the saturation of the column were measured as so called the hydraulic residence time the void volume was calculated subsequently the porosity of the column was calculated by dividing the void volume by the total volume of the column the bed porosity was computed to be 64 and the actual hydraulic residence time was equal to 2 53 h during the experiment duration analytical monitoring was performed for this portions of the effluents were collected at three heights 10 20 and 30 cm in a quartz cuvette 3 5 ml until reaching a constant concentration over time the effluents were analyzed at regular intervals by uv vis spectrophotometry at the wavelength of 222 nm the obtained absorbance was corrected based on the realized calibration curve from 0 to 100 mg l ibp solutions the breakthrough curves from the three sampling heights have been obtained by plotting c c0 effluent to influent concentration ratio versus the operating time t the breakthrough curves provide insight into the times of breakthrough tb and saturation ts of the column the breakthrough point is the instant at which the outlet concentration attains a specified percentage of the inlet concentration this percentage commonly between 5 and 10 may be based on legal threshold values or an operator specified limit 58 in fixed bed systems determining the breakthrough point is crucial as it defines the effluent volume that could be treated since no maximum limit was settled for releasing ibp in the environment a rate of 5 c c0 0 05 was considered to delineate the breakthrough time the saturation or exhaustion time was considered at c c0 0 95 the total adsorption capacity of the bed at saturation denoted qs mg g 1 was obtained from the area above the breakthrough curves using the following formula 14 q s q c 0 a s m q c 0 m 0 t s 1 c t c 0 ⅆ t where q is the influent flow rate l h c0 is the influent ibp concentration mg l as is the area above the breakthrough curve m is the quantity of adsorbent inserted in the column g ct is the effluent ibp concentration at a time t mg l and

efficiency y of the column at ts was computed using the following formula 16 y q c 0 a s q c 0 t s 100 a s t s 100 for the analysis of the breakthrough curves proper parameters are computed including the fraction of bed utilization fbu the empty bed contact time ebct the adsorbent usage rate ur and the length of the used bed known as the mass transfer zone mtz as follows 17 fbu q b q s t b a s 18

is a measurement of adsorbate adsorbent interaction and impacts the influent volume treated and the shape of the breakthrough curve 59 the mtz value indicates the active bed surface where adsorption occurred while fbu denotes the percentage of the column used for the adsorption 60 the number of bed volumes nbv was evaluated by dividing the volume of treated effluent up to the breakthrough point by the volume of the fixed bed 59 this adsorption parameter is dimensionless and is computed using the following expression 21 nbv volume of effluent treated up to breakthrough point volume of the bed 2 4 1 breakthrough curves fitting models to assess the influence of bed height on the adsorbent efficiency three analytical models namely yoon and nelson s model 61 clark model 62 and thomas model 63

q is the volumetric flow rate l h 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbents 3 1 1 physico chemical properties table s1 summarizes the elemental analysis results and the textural properties of rt bc and rt sabc after the steam activation process the c content increased while the h n and o decreased this considerable decline in the oxygen fraction is explained by the decomposition of the oxygen containing functional groups located on the biochar surface throughout both calcination and activation processes 64 furthermore the decrease in o content and increase in c content resulted in a lower polarity index o n c of the rt sabc 64 66 besides the loss of functional groups after steam activation resulted in high aromaticity of rt sabc h c 0 1 compared to rt bc h c 0 4 64 65 67 similarly the low n content in rt sabc is mainly attributed to the degradation of n containing compounds between 550 c and 850 c pyrolysis as well as the reactions occurring between nitrogenous functional groups and water and or oxygenated compounds steam activation 64 the ash content increased due to volatile components thermal degradation and the concentration of minerals in the solid phase 3 1 2 textural properties regarding textural properties the bet specific surface area of the rt sabc 710 15 m2 g 1 was almost doubled compared to that of rt bc 375 15 m2 g 1 this higher surface area is potentially due to the development of pores throughout the activation particularly micropores inside the activated char structure 65 the rt sabc surface area falls in good agreement with the values obtained for different physically steam activated carbons derived from biomass reported in the literature for ibp removal coconut shell steam activated carbon 726 m2 g 1 12 physically steam activated wood 899 m2 g 1 68 and date stone steam activated biochar 513 m2 g 1 69 the total pore volume of rt bc and rt sabc was observed to be 0 2093 cm3 g 1 and 0 3362 cm3 g 1 respectively corresponding to an increase of 160 after activation therefore rt sabc exhibits a better porous structure formation on its surface for ibp uptake because of its greater surface area and the significant pores volume rt bc micropores accounted for 65 5 of the total pores volume while mesopores were minorly present 10 however rt sabc micropores and mesopores represented 72 0 and 16 2 of the total pores volume respectively the reason is that steam was proven to drive the opening of clogged pores and the creation of new pores through the elimination of the c atoms from inside the solid carbon network disruption of the chemical skeleton and formation of porous structure at the surface 70 this increase in mesopores volume positively influences the adsorption mechanism contributing to easier ibp adsorption mesopores transport pores act as channels for micropores allowing more micropores to be available for the sorption of the adsorbate in the structure of the carbons 71 3 1 3 atr ftir of adsorbents to identify the functional groups located at the adsorbent s surface as they may considerably impact the adsorption process the ftir spectra of rt bc and rt sabc were analyzed in the wavelength range 400 to 4000 cm 1 the average atr ftir spectra are depicted in fig 2 in the wavenumber regions 4000 2400 cm 1 fairly small peak intensities were noticed for both sorbents the bands in the range 3300 3700 may be attributed to nh stretch vibration in amine and amide while the bands between 3200 and 3400 cm 1 are generally assigned to the oh stretching vibration of hydroxylic groups both bands seem less intensive for rt sabc confirming the loss of nitrogen and oxygenated functional groups after steam activation as found by the elemental analysis for rt bc peaks between 2800 and 3000 cm 1 are attributed to ch stretching vibrations in alkane and alkyl structures these peaks disappeared for rt sabc due to the volatilization of hydrogen during steam activation 72 two broad peaks were found in the region 2100 2380 cm 1 and linked to cco stretching in ketene groups 73 the first broadband was overlapped for both adsorbents with a peak at 2280 cm 1 however the second broadband 2150 2030 cm 1 was slightly shifted to lower values with a maximum peak of 2115 cm 1 the intensity of this second peak was higher for rt sabc due to the formation of more ketene groups during the activation a small fraction of the peak at 2242 cm 1 is assigned to the cn stretching of acrylic fibers acrylonitrile 74 the broad band observed between 1950 and 1640 cm 1 for rt sabc is more extensive than that of rt bc the peaks centered at 1800 cm 1 for rt sabc and 1700 cm 1 for rt bc can be assigned to the co stretching vibration related to ketone aldehyde ester polyester and or carboxylic acid groups both spectra presented a peak in the range of 1640 and 1400 cm 1 nevertheless the peak was remarkably more intense for rt bc than rt sabc as it is assigned to different functional groups for rt bc the peak at 1556 cm 1 is attributed to ch aliphatic stretching groups originating from cellulose degradation for rt sabc the peak at 1505 cm 1 is linked to the cc stretching vibration of aromatic rings after hydrogen volatilization the strong peaks for rt bc between 1220 and 1050 cm 1 are associated with co stretching in asymmetric aromatic ester coh and ether coc groups characteristic peaks of hemicellulose pyranose ring cellulose and polyesters 74 these peaks disappeared after the treatment as the material underwent depolymerization at a high temperature the large peak at 900 1050 cm 1 centered at 1020 cm 1 for rt bc may be assigned to phosphine and phosphine oxides stretching vibration this indicates that phosphorus containing flame retardants or additives could be introduced during the fabrication of the rt panels this peak is smaller for rt sabc owing to the reaction of these functional groups with water at high temperatures resulting in the formation of phosphoric acid and hydrogen during the steam activation 75 76 the peaks between 800 and 600 cm 1 and attributed to ch bending vibration in aromatics deformation bands out of plane seem to disappear after steam activation while the peaks in the lower region 600 400 cm 1 are common to both adsorbents 3 1 4 ph point of zero charge to complete the characterization the phpzc of both adsorbents was determined this parameter depends on the chemical and electronic properties of the functional groups and it is a good indicator of these properties the values of the phpzc of the rt bc and rt sabc were equal to 8 9 and 10 respectively these latter values indicate that negatively charged basic oxygenated groups dominate the surface of both studied adsorbents thus electrostatic attraction and h bonding could take place between ibp and the adsorbents when the ph of the solution is between the pka and phpzc pkaibp ph phpzc moreover the high phpzc values of both adsorbents might be attributed to the tremendous amounts of carbonyl groups pka 16 20 at their surface as described by guedidi et al 42 the atr ftir results confirm the presence of more carbonyl groups at the surface of the rt sabc thus proving the higher basicity of its surface 3 2 batch adsorption study 3 2 1 kinetics study and modeling to determine the equilibrium time and to elucidate the adsorption mechanism adsorption kinetics were investigated in deionized water besides the sorption rate information is relevant to the design and eventual scaling up of experiments realized at the laboratory scale such information is obtained by fitting the experimental data to specific kinetic models the kinetic performance and modeling of ibp on the 500 mg rt bc in batch mode conditions 50 mg l ibp solution 20 c and 250 rpm are displayed in fig 3a the results highlight that the adsorption capacity of the rt bc is limited to 4 17 mg g 1 removal efficiency of 5 3 therefore this adsorbent is inefficient for removing ibp from aqueous solutions the total equilibrium time corresponding to the appearance of the plateau was reached after 24 h the adsorption kinetic was fast in the first stage 8 h followed by a gradual occupation of the binding sites until achieving a steady state this fast kinetic was detected owing to the biochar s high macroporosity 30 similar results were obtained by álvarez torrellas et al 9 investigating the ibp adsorption onto multi walled carbon nanotubes macroporous materials therefore the textural properties of the adsorbent have a substantial evidence impact on ibp removal simultaneously the ph of the solution was measured throughout the kinetic experiments the obtained value ph 7 0 5 was higher than ibp pk a but lower than the phpzc of rt bc this ph value indicates that the target adsorbate is deprotonated ibp in the solution and that the biochar surface is positively charged consequently ibp adsorption is favorable owing to the electrostatic interaction between the adsorptive anion and dominated positively charged groups at the biochar surface generally in this zone repulsive effects are slightly active 77 however this low adsorption capacity could be attributed to the surface chemistry high polarity of the rt bc causing lower affinity towards ibp and higher affinity towards water molecules three models namely pfo pso and elovich were used to model the experimental kinetic data the parameters of these models are summarized in table 2 the results showed that pfo highest r2 0 9793 and lowest sse 0 0999 kinetic model explains better the ibp adsorption over rt bc closely followed by the pso r2 0 9673 therefore physisorption controls the kinetics of the adsorption the primary mechanisms involved could be hydrophobic interactions weak van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding the qe for rt bc was established to be 3 9 mg g 1 according to the pfo model closely matching the experimental value as the removal of ibp by rt bc was very low this adsorbent did not seem to exhibit good adsorptive performance towards ibp removal from water thus it has been neglected in the following steps similarly batch adsorption tests were performed on 0 5 g sieved rt sabc fig 3b displays the experimental and modeled kinetics obtained with this adsorbent the plot shows an initial fast stage in which the majority of the active sites are free followed by a progressively decreasing readily available sites stage in the end the adsorption is noticed to continue at a very slow rate up to 42 95 mg g 1 removal efficiency of about 52 5 the graph shows that the kinetic is far from reaching a steady state 96 h thus the equilibrium time was considered to be about 120 h this slowest ibp adsorption kinetic could be attributed to the higher micropore volume of the rt sabc at the ph of the solution ph 10 0 5 under these conditions ph pka and ph phpzc 0 5 the ibp sorption rate is reduced because of electrostatic attraction and repulsion occurring between ibp and the less positively and more negatively charged rt sabc surface however electron donor acceptor interaction a specific non covalent force between ibp π acceptors and the aromatic benzene rings π donors of rt sabc exists throughout the entire ph range even at high ph 78 79 the matching of the experimental data with the elovich model is noticeable this result is confirmed by the predicted adsorption kinetic data of the elovich model highest r2 0 9984 and lowest sse 0 4964 followed by the pso model r2 0 9835 shown in table 2 the matching with the elovich model indicates that the kinetics is governed by chemisorption second order and that the adsorbent surface is energetically heterogeneous 80 the chemisorption reveals the sharing or exchange of electrons by valence forces between ibp and rt sabc 5 from the predicted parameters the ibp adsorption initial rate represented by the elovich parameter α was equal to 17 418 mg g 1 h 1 and the number of sites available for adsorption was equal to 8 however the elovich model does not provide the adsorption capacity at equilibrium this parameter was obtained from the pso model and was evaluated to be around 43 mg g 1 to understand the adsorption behavior of the first hour t 1 h the ibp adsorption amount was calculated 1 β ln αβ and was found equal to 6 26 mg g 1 accounting for around 15 of the total ibp adsorption therefore the elovich model explains better the adsorption processes onto sieved rt sabc and forecasts an infinite adsorption capacity over a long period of time these results are in agreement with a previous study investigating the ibp adsorption on chemically surface modified activated carbon cloths 42 moreover the weber and morris intraparticle diffusion model was applied to investigate the adsorption mechanism this model is consistent and describes well the adsorption of ibp onto rt bc and rt sabc adsorbents fig 4 depicts the ipd model plot representing the adsorption capacity over time qt as a function of t1 2 for the 500 mg rt sabc and rt bc the obtained multi linear graph could be divided into three phases the regression equations of the three step model are summarized in table 3 the first phase characterizes the fast and instantaneous adsorption or the adsorption at the external surface for up to 7 h with the highest ipd adsorption rate parameter kp1 8 3320 for rt sabc and kp1 1 2589 for rt bc at this stage the plot passes through the origin indicating the absence of a boundary layer and the control of the adsorption rate by intraparticle diffusion the adsorption regression in the second phase gradually decreases kp2 4 4066 for rt sabc and kp2 0 3610 for rt bc which is typical for ibp transport within the inner adsorbent surface for about 25 h the third step is the final equilibrium adsorption phase in which adsorbate moves from macropores and mesopores to micropores at this latter stage ipd is decelerating kp3 2 2804 for rt sabc and kp3 0 0703 for rt bc owing to the low ibp concentrations in the solutions the regression in the second and third phases is also linear still it does not pass through the origin indicating that ipd does not solely control the adsorption rate determining mechanism 3 2 2 isotherm study and modeling in deionized water to describe the interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent adsorption isotherms are critical particularly for design purposes 72 the four models freundlich langmuir sips and temkin were applied to fit the experimental isotherm data 3 2 2 1 rt bc fig 5 shows the adsorption isotherm of ibp onto the tested rt bc adsorbent accordingly the maximum adsorption uptake was around 3 5 mg g 1 at equilibrium after 24 h one of the reasons for this low adsorption capacity could be the low adsorbent porosity particularly the undeveloped mesoporous structure due to the low presence of mesopores the access of ibp to adsorbent micropores is impeded by capillary effects 43 this isotherm can be classified as an s shape isotherm more precisely the s 3 subtype of giles classification 81 this isotherm shape indicates multilayer adsorption 82 83 in which a gradual vertical filling of the adsorbate on the available adsorption sites is taking place 81 the average pore size of rt bc diameter 2 14 nm and width 0 52 nm is close to ibp molecular dimensions 1 03 0 5 0 43 nm allowing a vertical packing of ibp onto the carbonaceous pores this pore filling mechanism could have contributed to this ibp uptake 9 31 84 the curve displays a small slope at the beginning with a plateau reached at an aqueous concentration of 45 mg l followed by a sharp rise of ibp adsorption onto the subsequent monolayers no limited sorption capacity is shown for the rt bc 85 the small exhibited plateau indicates the completion of the monolayer however it does not necessarily imply the ordering in a close packed layer of the adsorbate similar isotherm trends were found in previous studies involving the adsorption of ibp onto multi walled nanotubes 9 the adsorption of polar and nonpolar organic compounds onto carbon nanotubes 84 and the removal of diuron from water using activated carbon 86 comparable low ibp adsorption capacities have been reported in the literature using different raw biochars from wood and agricultural residues table s2 the surface chemistry of the adsorbent plays an essential role in the adsorption of ibp 9 according to the adsorption isotherm the s type profile reveals that water molecules compete with ibp for the binding sites of the sorbent 87 as the surface polarity of the rt bc is higher than the rt sabc because of the greater active hydrophilic sites oxygenated compounds on the rt bc surface fig 6a and b water molecules aggregation occurs these clusters bound to the carbon hydrophilic pores impede the accessibility of ibp hydrophobic drug to the surface of the sorbent 88 89 similar conclusions have been made by karanfil and kilduff 90 these authors have reported that numerous functional groups containing oxygen at the adsorbent surface or a high quantity of polar oxygen molecules in the carbon matrix improve the sorbent surface polarity and their selectivity for water besides several studies have demonstrated that oxidized sorbent surfaces exhibit reduced uptake of organic contaminants 91 93 and an enhanced uptake for polar adsorbates 94 none of the four isotherms models was able to fit the experimental points other isotherm models such as the bet model could potentially fit these points as the removal capacity was extremely low this adsorbent did not seem suitable for ibp removal hence it was no more considered for further experiments 3 2 2 2 rt sabc the experimental and modeled adsorption isotherms of ibp onto rt sabc adsorbent in distilled water are shown in fig 7 at equilibrium the maximum adsorption uptake was around 53 9 mg g 1 this value is much lower than that obtained with activated carbon cloth 492 mg g 1 having a very high surface area 1910 m2 g 1 this isotherm can be classified as an l shape isotherm more precisely the l 3 subtype of giles classification 81 denoting the progressive saturation of the active sites during adsorption it could be clearly seen that the temkin and freundlich nonlinear regression models poorly described the adsorption process whereas the best fitting of the experimental data is achieved by langmuir r2 0 9521 and sse 2 2513 and freundlich langmuir r2 0 9543 and sse 3 2394 isotherms the same findings were described by guedidi et al 42 on modified activated cloths rl and 1 n parameters of the langmuir and sips models were calculated the computed values rl 0 02 and 1 n 0 98 fall between 0 and 1 these rl and 1 n values indicate a favorable adsorption process close to irreversible adsorption rl 0 and 1 n 1 thus the adsorption process shows a monolayer profile on the energetically heterogeneous adsorbent surface without interactions between the adsorbate and the adsorbent the calculated constant parameters of the four models along with their r2 and sse values are reported in table 4 the surface chemistry and textural properties high adsorbent porosity could be behind the higher adsorption uptake 54 mg g 1 of ibp molecules onto the steam activated adsorbent when comparing the maximum adsorption uptake of this rt sabc to other sorbents derived from several types of waste table s3 this equilibrium capacity falls in the low to medium range of steam activated carbons adsorbing ibp 3 3 fixed bed adsorption study fixed bed adsorption test considers the adsorption dynamics to forecast operational characteristics such as the capacity of the adsorbent the adsorption in columns guarantees continuous contact between the adsorbent and the pollutant in treating aqueous solutions on a large scale this method enables efficient treatment of greater pollutant loads and guarantees that the adsorbate is constantly in direct contact with a fresh adsorbent 3 3 1 effect of bed height fig 8 shows the breakthrough curves obtained for the adsorption of ibp using different bed heights 10 20 and 30 cm in a fixed bed column under constant inlet concentration 25 mg l temperature 20 c and volumetric flow rate 0 22 ml min as the plots display the breakthrough curves are shifted to the right with increasing the bed depth both breakthrough and exhaustion times increased with increasing bed height for bed heights 10 20 and 30 cm the breakthrough times were around 2 8 and 20 days while saturation points were partially reached after 16 28 and 42 days respectively this partial saturation of the bed was explained by the superior contribution of microporosity in the adsorption process hindering the access of ibp molecules to all rt sabc inner pores similarly the effluent treated volume until breakthrough and saturation were increased for higher bed heights under a constant flow rate and feed concentration the volume of solution treated at breakthrough time for h 10 20 and 30 cm was about 0 6 2 5 and 6 4 l while it reached 6 9 and 13 5 l at saturation respectively moreover the breakthrough curves presented a flatter and tailing profile with comparatively less steep tendencies for higher bed heights shifting away from the origin reflecting a non ideal transport within the pores the above observations were also obtained by álvarez torrellas et al 9 for fixed bed adsorption of ibp on a microporous material f400 activated carbon the breakthrough curves for 20 and 30 cm heights were more or less symmetrical however for h 10 cm the curve was intensely sharp and asymmetrical attributed mainly to a not fully developed flow as the bed length is 5 cm shorter than the recommended one 15 cm the useful parameters calculated from the experimental data of the breakthrough curves for the three bed heights are provided in table 5 the maximum equilibrium capacity of the column at breakthrough and saturation increased with the bed height for h 20 and 30 cm the ibp adsorption capacity onto rt sabc at the breakthrough time increased from 15 to 25 mg g 1 while the adsorption capacity at saturation time rose from 28 to 40 mg g 1 respectively the reason is that more activated adsorbents were used for packing higher column heights therefore more active adsorption binding sites are available for capturing ibp molecules resulting in greater contact time to reach saturation 72 the high amount of adsorbent implies sufficient time for ibp to diffuse over the rt sabc pores and the uptake capacity is subsequently raised however the total adsorption capacity in the dynamic mode was lower than in the batch mode possible explanations could include the different residence times in the batch and dynamic experiments along with the stirring conditions in the batch tests that favor external diffusion as the adsorbents and adsorbate move freely in the solution hence better interactions between active adsorbent sites and adsorbate molecules occur similar results were reported by feizi et al 88 using tire based activated carbon for the removal of pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions another reason for adsorption capacity is the lower ibp to the available adsorption sites ratio as demonstrated by chen et al 67 corroborating the above observation all the parameters including ebct fbu mtz and nbv increased with the bed depth table 5 similarly ibp removal efficiency y increased from 37 to 74 when the depth was raised from 10 to 30 cm therefore a more extended bed height column is favored for better column performance 3 3 2 modeling of the breakthrough curves the modeling of the breakthrough curves is essential for the successful design and operation of the fixed bed column therefore three empirical models namely clark thomas and yoon nelson were used to analyze and fit the experimental breakthrough points by nonlinear regression using minitab the predicted breakthrough curves by these models eqs 22 24 are illustrated in fig 8 for the different bed heights and the model s parameters are depicted in table 6 the results showed that the clark model had the highest r2 coefficient 0 9860 0 9845 and the lowest sse 0 0448 0 0244 for the bed lengths of 10 20 cm reflecting its best correlation with the experimental data for the height of 30 cm all three models fit exceptionally well the observed data as presented by the same highest r2 value of 0 9985 and the lowest sse of 0 0027 thus confirming the superimposed curves regarding the parameters the predicted value for the maximum adsorption uptake determined by the thomas model is qt 40 0445 mg g 1 quite similar to the experimental calculated one additionally the yoon nelson model predicts the 50 of fixed bed saturation which was equal to 756 h very close to the experimental one 758 9 h this time required for 50 breakthrough increased from 119 to 756 h with bed depth increased from 10 to 30 cm due to the increase in loading capacity 59 this is also corroborated by the decrease in model rate constant k yn due to delayed breakthrough time the rate constants of the yoon nelson and thomas kyn and kt decreased with increasing the bed height owing to delayed breakthrough times considering the results of the fixed bed adsorption column the thomas and clark models could be successfully applied to describe the breakthrough curves of ibp onto the rt sabc these models are based on the second order reversible reaction kinetics langmuir equilibrium isotherm thomas model and freundlich isotherm clark model both models consider the fixed bed column as a plug flow reactor with a negligible contribution to the dispersion phenomenon similarly previous studies have confirmed the better application of thomas and or yoon nelson models on ibp adsorption in columns using nano adsorbent clay 33 zirconium allied alginate beads 95 and raspberry mesoporous carbon 96 3 3 3 adsorption mechanism the mechanism of adsorption taking place in the elimination of ibp by rt sabc was examined using atr ftir before and after the adsorption of the pharmaceutical molecule this spectroscopic analysis has revealed valuable information about the exact functional groups and the locations of the chemical bonds involved in the chemical interaction 97 the spectra are displayed in fig 9 accordingly the functional groups at the rt sabc surface were noticed to be involved in ibp adsorption due to the apparent variations in the intensity of several peaks a slightly higher intensity band was detected in the region 3400 3800 cm 1 indicating the involvement of amide groups located at the rt sabc surface in ibp adsorption similar observations were reported by dubey et al 98 confirming the dipolar interaction between amide groups and ibp the removal of ibp could have occurred via the formation of a six membered stable ring moreover a slight increment in the peaks intensity between 2800 and 3000 cm 1 ch stretching in alkane and alkyl and 2100 2380 cm 1 cco stretching in ketenes was noticed on the other hand a weakening of the intensity of the peaks between 1900 and 1640 cm 1 co ketones aldehyde ester and carboxylic acids 1640 1400 cm 1 cc stretching of aromatic rings and 1100 800 cm 1 co stretching in ester and ether was observed after adsorption the interactions between ibp and the functional groups of rt sabc and the shielding effect of the ibp drug could be responsible for this weakening 99 the masking of carboxylic peaks confirmed the chemical complexation between ibp molecules and rt sabc 100 3 4 competitive adsorption study the degree of removal of a target adsorbate from aqueous matrices among co pollutants depends primarily on the ionization and surface charges of the adsorbent the adsorption capacity and affinity of adsorbents during ibp removal are concurrently impacted by the existence of ions in the solution and or other micropollutants understanding these properties is critical in adsorption technology as they produce effects such as electrostatic salting out filtering and aggregation at sorbent sorbate interfaces 31 several authors have demonstrated that water chemistry including ph and inorganic constituents e g na ca2 mg2 k cl so4 2 no3 hco3 impacts the adsorption of pharmaceuticals 79 101 103 the adsorption process of ibp ph 8 5 and c0 2 mg l was improved by 43 16 2 and 1 in the presence of ca2 so4 2 mg2 and k respectively 79 qiu et al 102 and xu et al 103 have observed a positive influence of electrolyte ions and salinity on organic pollutants adsorption on different biochars owing to increased ionic strength in the solution the presence of cations in the water neutralizes the negative charges on the biochar surface effectively weakening the electrostatic repulsion forces between the biochar surface and the ibp 79 102 104 other studies have demonstrated that numerous pharmaceuticals form complex compounds with divalent cations ca2 and mg2 105 these complexes can be neutral or positively charged raising the interaction with the negatively charged sorbent surface rich in carboxyl groups therefore ca2 ions strongly bind with the carboxylic groups resulting in less electrostatic repulsion and higher removal efficiency 79 106 preliminary kinetic and isotherm experiments were performed using tap water drinking water to investigate the ibp adsorption onto rt sabc and the synergistic impact of non target mineral salts on the adsorption process the composition of the tap water used in these experiments is presented in table s4 107 the ph of the solution was found to be 9 0 2 throughout the tap water experiment the solution ph is an essential parameter for adsorption control 5 101 108 the presence of salts and electrolyte ions water constituents reduced the solution ph and improved the ibp adsorption kinetics and isotherm under this ph condition phpka ibp ph phpzc rt sabc thus electrostatic repulsion forces are reduced and electrostatic attraction forces are enhanced between the positively charged rt sabc surface and the anionic ibp although the slow kinetic adsorption of ibp hydrophobic compounds in tap water the equilibrium was far from being reached after 198 h 8 days as presented in fig 10 the adsorption uptake in tap water reached 53 11 mg g 1 after 48 h removal efficiency of 72 65 8 mg g 1 after 120 h removal efficiency of 83 and 73 8 mg g 1 after 198 h removal efficiency of 93 in tap water since the adsorption is noticed to continue progressively at a very slow rate after 120 h the equilibrium time was considered to be about 120 h consequently the kinetic adsorption tests in tap water revealed better ibp removal onto rt sabc than in deionized water similar observations were reported by yaqubi et al that have shown a higher removal percentage of amoxicillin in tap water 72 than in distilled water 62 after 24 h using leached carbon black waste chitosan beads 107 the adsorption of ibuprofen exhibited pronounced ph dependence indeed ibuprofen is a hydrophobic compound and thus would occupy faster the active pore sites of the adsorbent therefore little or no competition would exist between ionized molecules hydrophilic and ibp on the adsorbent sites similar observations were reported by jung et al 101 the experimental equilibrium adsorption amounts q e were calculated using the same kinetic conditions while varying the weight of the crushed rt sabc between 0 05 and 1 g in tap water fig 11 after 120 h the maximum adsorption uptake was 60 mg g 1 15 greater than that obtained with the same adsorbent in deionized water therefore the increase in ionic strength exhibited a positive effect on ibp adsorption 3 5 spent adsorbent disposal the proper disposal of the used adsorbents is strongly recommended because of the environmental issues involved indeed unsafe disposal of spent adsorbents can lead to increasing environmental pollution due to the formation of secondary pollutants leaching into soil and contaminating groundwater 12 109 according to the world health organization who directive entitled guidelines for safe disposal of unwanted pharmaceuticals in and after emergencies adsorbents loaded with ibuprofen can be safely disposed of following the recommended disposal techniques for pharmaceuticals 5 109 the adsorption of ibuprofen onto rt sabc is nearly irreversible this suggests that ibp once adsorbed can neither diffuse along nor desorb from the sorbent surface the ibp laden rt sabc has a high calorific value 30 mj kg it can be used as an alternative to coal and be incinerated for energy recovery or gasified for the production of syngas 45 other proper disposal processes reported in the literature include waste immobilization by encapsulation chemical decomposition or firing in open containers 5 12 4 conclusions this study investigated the possibility of valorizing biochar and steam activated biochar derived from recycled textiles insulation panels at end of life as adsorbents for removing ibuprofen from aqueous systems from this work the following conclusions can be made the microporous biochar had fast kinetics and the experimental data were best fitted to the pseudo first order model the biochar exhibited a multilayer isotherm profile with a low maximum adsorption capacity of 4 mg g 1 removal efficiency of 5 3 owing to the clustering of water molecules and blocking carbon hydrophilic pores the microporous and mesoporous steam activated biochar had slow kinetics and the elovich model best fitted the data the adsorption isotherm showed a monolayer profile with high maximum adsorption uptake of 54 mg g 1 at equilibrium removal efficiency 50 after steam activation the higher surface area and developed pores are behind the greater ibp adhesion sips and langmuir s models better explained the adsorption of ibp onto the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent the weber and morris model adequately fitted the ibp adsorption onto both adsorbents in the fixed bed column increasing the bed height increases the breakthrough time and adsorption capacity 40 mg g 1 at saturation the higher mass of activated adsorbents and more active binding sites resulted in higher contact time with depth the results of the dynamic test agreed with the batch experiments this continuous system treated 6 4 l of effluent volume at breakthrough and 13 5 l at saturation for a height of 30 cm clark thomas and yoon nelson s models best fitted the experimental breakthrough curves atr ftir spectra before and after the adsorption elucidated that amide ketone aldehyde ester ether carboxylic acid and aromatic ring groups seemed to be involved in the mechanism of adsorption of ibuprofen by the steam activated biochar preliminary experiments in tap water on crushed steam activated biochar showed an improved ibp removal efficiency 72 after 48 h owing to the reduced solution ph below the phpzc due to salts and ionized molecules in tap water the spent adsorbents can be burnt for energy recovery or gasified for syngas production the steam activated biochar could be an alternative efficient adsorbent for removing ibuprofen from aqueous media to improve the knowledge about ibuprofen adsorption onto both studied adsorbents a complete batch adsorption study should be performed to evaluate the influence of several parameters such as adsorbent dose solution ph temperature agitation speed and initial adsorbate concentration on ibuprofen sorption additionally studies of the sorption thermodynamics and the desorption of ibuprofen for sorbent regeneration should be conducted to determine the degree of reusability of the sorbent or to confirm the irreversibility of the adsorption process future fixed bed adsorption experiments should examine the effects of different operating conditions temperature ph inlet concentration flow rate and contact time on the breakthrough curves and the removal of ibuprofen further characterization of the steam activated biochar boehm titration etc should be investigated to go deeper into the adsorption mechanism of ibp onto the rt sabc surface and to provide a chemical reaction process scheme of the ionic interactions furthermore a techno economic study has to be carried out to find the economic feasibility of the process at an industrial scale also batch and dynamic adsorption tests in real wastewater are desired to be investigated in the future finally further studies should also consider testing the adsorption of other pharmaceutical molecules such as antibiotics or other anti inflammatory drugs onto the studied biochar and activated carbon to determine the selectivity of the adsorbent to ibuprofen with respect to other molecules declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

corresponding authors constructed wetland microbial fuel cells cw mfc and aeration technology are typically used for the treatment of mariculture wastewater with a low carbon nitrogen ratio and high salinity however salt inhibition limits their efficiency here based on cw mfc an electroactive bacteria algae biofilm and siphon aeration technology were employed in a pilot study to validate their technical and economic feasibility the system yielded average removal efficiencies of 80 99 1 3 92 59 3 13 94 03 5 11 97 38 3 62 and 95 95 2 59 respectively for chemical oxygen demand total phosphorus

extracellular respiratory bacteria geobacteraceae 9 47 and pseudomonas 2 54 and microalgae bacteria pseudooceanicola 12 45 and hoeflea 7 45 were significantly enriched the energy consumption per ton of sewage treatment was 0 0045 kwh m 3 representing 47 87 lower costs than those related to traditional aeration these results proved the feasibility of cw mfc coupled with electroactive bacteria algae biofilm and siphon aeration tidal flow technology for mariculture wastewater treatment keywords mariculture wastewater constructed wetland microbial fuel cells electroactive bacteria algae biofilm microbial community economic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mariculture effluent is an organic wastewater with a low carbon nitrogen c n containing phosphate antibiotics and heavy metals in china the inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate concentrations of major marine aquaculture zones are 52 1 and 68 1 higher than the national standards respectively 1 the effective treatment of mariculture wastewater is of great significance to protect marine environment because of large load capacity and low cost constructed wetlands cws are popular for mariculture wastewater treatment wang et al 2 reported high removal rates of nh4 n and total nitrogen at 95 7 and 99 4 respectively when cws are used to treat saline wastewater however cws have shortcomings such as unstable and weak treatment efficiency 3 in several studies microbial fuel cells mfcs were coupled with cws to enhance the pollutant removal efficiency in cw mfc microorganisms decompose organic matter and generate electrons in the anaerobic anode region which are transferred to the cathode via an external circuit realizing energy recovery 4 nevertheless high salinity considerably affects microbial communities and limits the pollutant removal efficiency camacho et al 5 discovered that when the wastewater salinity was increased by the nacl concentration from 0 51 to 9 51 g l 1 the voltage was enhanced and the best salinity concentration to voltage was 4 5 g l 1 however higher salinity levels caused the opposite effect thus improving the efficiency of cw mfc systems under high salinity environments is necessary previous studies proved that bacteria algae biofilms can better adapt to high salinity environment 6 the symbiotic association between marine microalgae and microorganisms decreases the salt impact it has been reported that high salinity encouraged bacteria to secrete more indole 3 acetic acid in the bacteria algae system which could be metabolized by algae and then improve algae growth and lipid production the algae and bacteria can form a favorable symbiotic association under the salty conditions the salt tolerance of marine microalgae makes the bacteria algae system adjust to the inhibitory effect of a high salinity environment these aspects partially contributed to the better overall performance and stability of bacteria algae system under high salinity conditions 7 besides bacteria algae biofilms easily maintain the ph balance of system thus improving the pollutant removal efficiency of system moreover when bacteria algae biofilms were coupled with the mfcs algae and bacteria gradually adhered on the electrode to form an electroactive bacteria algae biofilm wrapped in extracellular polysaccharide as a communication channel for intercellular electron transfer and interactions 8 thus algae bacteria biofilms can improve the cw mfc system in fact some researches on the construction and effect of electroactive bacteria algae biofilm have already been made for example wang et al 9 reported that the synergistic metabolism of electroactive bacteria algae biofilm leads to the enrichment of electroactive bacteria and microalgae and improves the efficiency of the cw mfc treatment of freshwater aquaculture wastewater however there is rare research on the high salinity wastewater treatment via the enhancement of cw mfcs with bacteria algae biofilms salinity has an important effect on microorganisms the construction of electroactive bacteria algae film in the high salinity wastewater and its effect needs to be further studied on the other hand appropriate aeration supplies oxygen to the cathode and boosts the formation of electroactive bacteria algae biofilms the traditional continuous aeration approach consumes high amounts of energy and does not create alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions to complete the nitrification and denitrification processes fortunately this problem can be solved with siphon aeration tidal flow constructed wetlands tf cw can enrich microorganism based on the generation of alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions thus improving pollutants degradation 10 11 zhang et al 12 demonstrated that tf cw mfc increases denitrification and decreases methane emissions in wastewater with a low carbon nitrogen ratio as the water level rises and falls a contact empty tidal cycle is generated which boosts the cathode microbial activity and wastewater pollutant removal however the use of electroactive biofilms coupled with the siphon aeration technique in cw mfc to treat mariculture wastewater has rarely been reported this study innovatively constructed salt tolerant electroactive bacteria algae biofilm to enhance the efficiency of cw mfc systems moreover siphon aeration tidal flow technology was coupled and such a system was applied in the treatment of mariculture wastewater in pilot scale pollutant removal efficiency microbial process and economic analysis were focused it aims to explore the technical and economic feasibility of electroactive bacteria algae technology for water treatment of mariculture the results provide a theoretical basis and a technological path for mariculture wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of cw mfc systems fig 1 depicts a unique device construction for the cw mfc system all four experimental devices were built using plastic barrels with a total capacity of 200 l the devices were divided into three portions from the bottom to the top pebbles were deposited at the bottom as a support layer of approximately 40 cm the middle layer was filled with activated carbon and the uppermost layer was the outflow layer carbon cloth with a thickness of 5 cm weight of 50 g m 2 and diameter of 50 cm was used for both the anode and cathode areas cm c and cm d were built as a closed circuit cw mfc system by connecting the anode and cathode with brass wire an external 1000 ω resistor and a voltage smart monitor to both ends of the resistor for continuous monitoring of the closed circuit voltage 2 2 operation of cw mfc systems continuous aeration was carried out at a rate of 1000 ml min 1 in the top layers of cm a and cm c and inverted u shaped siphons were fitted for the treated water to exit at the cathodes of cm b and cm d when the maximum water level was reached the siphon was automatically activated water was promptly drained from the cathode chamber and its level recovered to the height of the siphon input in addition marine microalgae were inoculated in the cathode portions of cm b cm c and cm d to form an electroactive bacterial algae biofilm system the experiment was conducted using four experimental groups four experimental control groups cm a cm b cm c and cm d were assembled for this study the temperature was maintained at 23 c mariculture wastewater is a kind of low c n wastewater with the value of 2 1 7 1 1 so synthetic mariculture wastewater with a low c n was provided as showed in table 1 sea salt generated from south china sea with major components of nacl k ca2 mg2 were used to simulate the seawater with a salinity of 30 for continuous operation of the experiment the influent salinity was progressively increased from 0 to 30 an average salinity of the world s oceans to ensure that the microorganisms could gradually acclimatize for biofilm formation 2 3 sludge injection and electroactive bacterial algae enrichment fresh sludge was purchased from a wastewater treatment plant and seeded uniformly on the carbon cloth of the cathode with concentration of 13 60 0 25 g vss l 1 13 granular sludge was domesticated in diameter of 2 0 3 0 mm by gradually increasing the influent salinity to reduce the negative effect of high salinity on bacterial growth marine microalgae were obtained from shangchuan island jiangmen guangdong province china and cultivated in an intelligent light incubator with a light dark time ratio of 12 12 and a 22 c temperature controlled incubation according to high throughput sequencing the dominant genera were hoeflea and pseudooceanicola firstly the microalgae were cultured under low light until they reached the logarithmic growth phase in guillard f 2 medium 14 after the logarithmic growth period half of the algae were transferred to a new medium and then culture up to the logarithmic growth period repeating the culture transfer step by step throughout the expansion culture the algal medium was shaken three times a day to ensure the equal dispersion of algae and to prevent cell sedimentation algal development was frequently checked using an optical microscope olympus ckx53 tokyo japan to ensure adequate growth finally the algal solution was expanded to a capacity of 2000 ml algae from the logarithmic development stage were cultured rinsed multiple times with synthetic saltwater table 1 and centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 rpm cr22g hitachi koki co ltd kyoto japan this process was repeated three times the algae were evenly dispersed over the cathode surface of the three experimental groups cm b cm c and cm d and mixed with granular sludge to generate electroactive bacterial algae biofilms under the influence of mfc 2 4 sampling and testing methods water samples were collected from the uppermost layer of the system filtered with a 0 45 μm filter membrane and then subjected to testing the wastewater testing methods and parameters were analyzed based on apha and epa guidelines the ph was measured using a ph meter phs 3e lei magi shanghai china dissolved oxygen do was measured using a portable dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach usa soluble cod was determined using lianhua technology s rapid detector and tp no2 n no3 n tn nh4 n were measured by uv spectrophotometer uv 1900i shimadzu kyoto japan using standard operation methods cu2 were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aa6200 shimadzu kyoto japan the sulfamethoxazole smx was determined using high performance liquid chromatography 1200 agilent usa the chromatographic column was c18 the detection wavelength was set at 258 nm and the monitoring time duration 3 min the organic phase of the hplc is methanol and the aqueous phase is 0 1 acetic acid water a digital voltmeter using an at89c51 microcontroller and china mobile s onenet iot interface was designed to continually monitor the voltage and output data online at the end of the experiment samples of anode sludge and cathode electroactive bacteria algae biofilm were collected to better understand the effects of electroactive bacterial algal systems on the composition of microbial communities in biofilm carriers the samples were washed in an ultrasonic cleaner for 30 min then filtered through sterile 0 22 μm filter paper and finally freeze dried under vacuum and crushed to extract the dna to analyze the composition and differences in microbial communities on biofilm carriers the fastdnatm spin kit qiagen ca usa was used to extract the sample dna three times the samples were subjected to 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing by the illumina hiseq2500 pe250 platform for high throughput sequencing 15 additional information regarding polymerase chain reaction and sequencing can be found in a previous study 16 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall treatment performance the cm d experimental group exhibited the best removal efficiency for various pollutants the average removal rates of cod tp tn smx and cu2 by cm d were 80 99 1 3 90 81 5 67 94 82 4 74 97 38 3 62 and 95 95 2 59 respectively with an average voltage of 354 23 mv 3 1 1 removal of smx fig 2a depicts the smx treatment efficiencies of the four systems with the average removal efficiencies of 83 65 3 23 cm a 87 66 5 12 cm b 93 33 4 59 cm c and 97 38 3 13 cm d respectively the nitrogen and carbon of smx can be utilized by microalgae growth in the microalgae bacteria system and antibiotic breakdown is promoted 17 the co metabolic pathway of smx by microalgae and bacteria was proposed involving the breakdown of side chain reactions of the amine group on the benzene ring oxidation and hydroxylation and pterin related conjugation 18 based on the microbial community marine microalgae such as pseudooceanicola and hoeflea are enriched in the cathodic layer of cm b 11 83 cm c 16 02 and cm d 19 90 microalgae had a selective ability of the bacterial community 19 resulting in the formation of a more stable state moreover some organic substances released by chlorella demonstrated antibacterial activity against specific bacteria besides proteobacteria have been shown to reduce the virulence of smx by synergistic metabolism 20 hence the bacterial algal system contributes to smx breakdown and microalgae development furthermore the closed circuit system cm c 93 33 4 59 and cm d 97 38 3 13 outperformed the open circuit device cm a 83 65 3 23 and cm b 87 66 5 12 in terms of smx elimination the role of cw mfc in antibiotic removal has been studied previously on one hand microorganisms employ electrons to break down complex compounds such as smx into short chain organics which are subsequently oxidized by electroactive bacteria 21 on the other hand voltage and current enhance the antibiotic adsorption on the electrode surface in the mfc 22 microbial community analysis revealed that the closed circuit systems cm c 16 02 10 52 and cm d 19 90 12 01 contained more marine microalgae and electroactive bacteria respectively than the open circuit systems cm a 0 91 4 67 and cm b 11 83 5 74 under electrochemical stimulation the enrichment of marine microalgal and electroactive bacteria can be increased resulting in a high rate of antibiotic removal from wastewater in addition the results of previous research showed that extracellular respiratory bacteria erb can be introduced via bacteria algae symbiosis and mfc coupling systems and erb have a high metabolic efficiency owing to direct interspecies electron transfer 23 direct interspecies electron transfer can transport electrons through conductive mycelia and direct touch enhancing the metabolic rate and the efficiency of electron transfer by working with erb to increase the removal efficiency of pollutants microalgae compensate for the lack of an electroactive biofilm 9 the removal efficiency of cm d 97 38 3 13 with siphon aeration was higher than that of cm c 93 33 4 59 with continuous aeration chen et al 24 discovered that extracellular polymers absorb a small amount of smx and majority of the smx is biodegraded by anoxic microorganisms continuous artificial aeration destroys the anaerobic environment in the anode layer and decreases the smx removal whereas siphon aeration provides an alternating aerobic anoxic environment for microbial smx removal based on this experiment the tf cw mfc with the electroactive bacterial algae biofilm achieved the better smx removal efficiency 3 1 2 removal of copper ions the removal efficiencies for heavy metal copper ions in the four experimental groups were cm a 69 94 4 46 cm b 84 25 8 02 cm c 89 97 5 6 and cm d 95 95 5 29 as shown in fig 2b the cu2 effluent concentration in cm a 1 21 0 23 mg l 1 without marine microalgae was much greater than that in cm b 0 64 0 29 mg l 1 cm c 0 40 0 21 mg l 1 and cm d 0 16 0 09 mg l 1 with marine microalgae heavy metals have a high binding affinity to the cell wall of microalgae 25 carbohydrates proteins and lipids are the primary components of microalgal cell walls and include several functional groups such as carboxyl cooh hydroxyl oh phosphate po3h amino nh2 and sulfhydryl so3h 26 which are always negatively charged on the cell wall allowing them to easily bind heavy metal ions thus the bacterial algae biofilm system was more effective than the bacterial biofilm system concerning heavy metals removal the copper ion removal effectiveness of cm c 89 97 5 60 and cm d 95 95 5 29 in the closed circuit system was greater than that of cm a 69 94 4 46 and cm b 84 25 8 02 in the open circuit system because copper ion reduction occurs after electrons are generated in the anode chamber via an external connection to the cathode chamber in the cw mfc system 27 the effluent also contains precipitates because of the cyclic conversion of sulfide and sulfate in the cw mfc system sulfate reducing bacteria reduce sulfate ions under anaerobic conditions producing precipitates such as cus and sulfur monomers in the solution 28 microbial community analysis revealed that cm c 13 02 and cm d 11 52 in the closed circuit system were more enriched in sedimenticola spp linked to sulfur removal than cm a 8 03 and cm b 5 46 in the open circuit system supporting the previous hypothesis although both closed circuit systems showed a high copper ion removal efficiency the siphon aeration device cm d 95 95 5 29 outperformed the continuous aeration device cm c 89 97 5 6 compared with artificial continuous aeration siphon aeration provided an alternating aerobic anaerobic environment for copper ion removal to ensure the electrochemical reduction in the anode chamber therefore the tf cw mfc system with the electroactive bacterial algae biofilm exhibits the best cu2 removal effect 3 1 3 electrical production performance after the experimental system was stabilized the average voltage of cm d was 354 23 mv which was higher than that of cm c 208 73 mv the voltage of the cw mfc system with tidal flow through siphon aeration was significantly greater than that with artificial aeration the do in the effluent of cm c 7 03 mg l 1 with continuous aeration was consistently higher than that in cm d 6 98 mg l 1 with siphon aeration the artificial aeration in the cathode chamber introduced high concentrations of oxygen but if the aeration time is extended the number of electrons produced by the anode and the oxygen atoms in the cathode do not match properly 29 siphon aeration creates an anaerobic aerobic environment which is needed to maintain an electron balance between the cathode and anode 30 this explains why the voltage in the siphon aeration system is much higher than that of the artificial aeration system furthermore the microalgae can produce oxygen at the cathode via photosynthesis promoting pollution removal and electron transfer in the mfc and thus greatly increasing the output voltage of mfc fig 2e shows the power generation performance during the 120 days of continuous experiments in the early stage the ionic strength of the electrolyte increased and the internal resistance decreased with increasing salinity thus improving the electron transfer rate and electricity production performance in the lower salinity range 31 meanwhile when the salinity reached 20 the voltage started to drop with the increasing salinity high salinity causes an osmotic pressure gap resulting in the inhibition or killing of several bacteria due to cytoplasmic breakdown 32 however when subjected to salt and electrochemical stimulation the microbial diversity declines the concentration of specialized species increases and the microbial community eventually adapts to salinity and promotes electron production and transmission 33 the addition of smx and cu2 in the third stage of the experiment caused a short period of voltage fluctuation with an average voltage of 137 mv cm c and 306 mv cm d respectively which was lower than that in the following stabilization period the fluctuation was caused by electroactive bacteria which are extremely sensitive to chemicals such as antibiotics and metals and inhibit the electrochemical activity metabolic activity and biomass of microorganisms the self recovery ability of the electroactive bacteria increases as the microorganisms adapt to the environment resulting in microbial communities and voltage stabilization furthermore heavy metal containing wastewater has a high redox potential and may be utilized as a cathodic electrolyte for metal reduction and treatment 34 thus cu2 boosts the solution conductivity while decreasing the charge transfer resistance as a result the voltages in the later stage are larger 3 1 4 cod removal efficiency fig 2c depicts the cod elimination efficiency for each of the three stages of the experiment the highest removal efficiency of cm a 54 63 cm b 73 68 cm c 73 75 and cm d 81 89 were observed the cw mfc system with tidal flow had a higher cod removal efficiency than the other three groups on the other hand the ability of microorganisms to reduce cod varies with the salinity high salinities were observed from days 10th to 40th and the rise in osmotic pressure easily caused cytoplasmic breakdown and death of microorganisms 35 it also restricted their activity resulting in a decrease in the cod removal efficiency during this period the closed circuit mfc system improved pollutant removal efficiency after the experimental system was stabilized the average cod removal rates of cm c 69 51 8 37 and cm d 80 99 1 3 were significantly higher than those of the cm a 52 84 2 59 and cm b 69 53 4 4 the results of the microbial community analysis revealed that the number of marine salt tolerant bacteria such as muricauda and xanthomarina in cm c 17 89 and cm d 24 48 in the closed circuit system was greater than that in cm a 14 48 and cm b 21 86 in the open circuit system electrochemical techniques can boost the development and enrichment of salt tolerant bacteria to increase cod removal furthermore chloride ions are transformed to chlorine at the anode and react with water molecules to generate hypochlorous acid which is a powerful oxidant that indirectly increases the cod removal efficiency 36 aeration altered the living environment of microorganisms resulting in varying treatment effects the effluent do content of cm a 7 12 mg l 1 cm b 6 87 mg l 1 cm c 7 03 mg l 1 and cm d 6 98 mg l 1 were consistently lower than the influent do concentration 7 26 mg l 1 aerobic bacteria degraded the organic matter and nitrogen when the wetland was flooded lowering the do content of the effluent the cod removal rate of the siphon system in cm b 69 53 4 4 and cm d 80 99 1 3 is consistently higher than the continuous aeration system in cm a 52 84 2 59 and cm c 69 51 8 37 because the strong artificial aeration diffuses oxygen to the support layer and even the anode destroying the anaerobic environment and thus affecting organic matter degradation by anaerobic ways consequently compared with artificial continuous aeration the siphon aeration technology saved energy boosted microbial activity and provided an aerobic aerobic environment for microbial growth 3 1 5 biological phosphorus removal fig 2d shows the tp removal performance of the four devices following experimental stabilization the average tp removal rates for the four systems were 61 98 3 51 cm a 74 67 7 79 cm b 82 75 5 67 cm c and 90 81 5 67 cm d in general phosphorus can be removed by both abiotic phosphorus precipitation and biotic phosphorus assimilation whereas orthophosphate precipitation primarily occurs in the ph range of 9 11 37 the ph range in this experiment was 6 7 7 4 therefore the abiotic phosphorus removal was considered negligible traditional biological phosphorus removal processes are sensitive to salinity marine algae can grow under high salinity conditions enriching salt tolerant bacteria and enhancing phosphorus removal efficiency phosphorus is an important nutrient for microalgae and is involved in several intracellular processes such as information storage and signaling 38 k2hpo4 can directly enter microalgal cells directly through transporters within the cell membrane boosting phosphorus removal based on the experimental results cm c 82 75 5 67 and cm d 90 81 5 67 with closed circuit had greater tp removal efficiency than cm a 61 98 3 51 and cm b 74 67 7 79 in the open circuit the mfc boosted the synergistic metabolism of bacterial algae biofilms improving the tp elimination by microorganisms bacteria algae coupled mfcs significantly altered the microbial community structure increased electroactive bacteria and microorganisms involved in pollutant breakdown the symbiosis between microalgae and electroactive bacteria protected the algae from damage chemicals in the wastewater and improved pollutant removal wang et al 39 demonstrated that the microalgal based pmfc was cost effective for domestic wastewater treatment in which achieved up to 93 2 of cod 95 9 of nh4 n 95 1 of tn and 82 7 of po4 3 p removal efficiency as well as 466 9 mw m 3 of maximum power density the experiment results indicate that cm d 90 81 5 67 with siphon aeration showed a much higher average tp removal efficiency than cm c 82 75 5 67 this was due to the siphon s alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions which facilitated biological phosphorus removal by phosphorus polymerizing bacteria 40 frequent backwashing is essential for phosphorus removal in biofilter systems 41 in this experiment the siphon was spontaneously triggered when the water level reached the top of the spout the water in the cathode was quickly emptied by the siphon outlet the water level was dropped to the height of the siphon entrance ensuring a particular frequency of backwashing boosting the phosphorus removal performance 3 1 6 denitrification efficiency fig 3 depicts the comparing of the nitrogen removal efficiency of the four reactors the reason of the poor tn removal efficiency in the first stage was primarily due to the salinity change which made it difficult for the microbial adaption and even resulted in the death of bacteria due to the impact of osmotic pressure after the experimental system was stabilized the average tn removal efficiency of each reactor was 66 88 4 54 cm a 78 08 6 57 cm b 87 89 6 09 cm c and 94 82 4 74 cm d respectively the removal of nh4 n and no2 n mainly depends on microbial nitrification and the no3 n removal is primarily based on denitrification the comparisons of fig 3a b and c reveals the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n and no2 n in the first stage were 21 56 and 28 82 cm a 18 34 and 40 10 cm b 48 67 and 65 61 cm c 42 92 and 54 99 cm d they were lower than the no3 n removal efficiencies 26 84 31 65 38 99 and 46 87 respectively because nitrifying bacteria are more sensitive to salinity shock than denitrifying bacteria and anaerobic bacteria can better adapt to sudden salinity changes than aerobic bacteria 42 in contrast to the high salinity inhibition of the cm a and cm b systems coupling with an electroactive bacteria algae biofilm in cm c and cm d promoted microalgae and bacterial cell tolerance to high salinity the closed circuit cw mfc provides a mixed aerobic and anaerobic environment and produces an electron flow that enhances pollutant removal and eliminates issues related to an insufficient carbon supply during denitrification 12 thereby improving the denitrification efficiency after the systems stabilized the average removal rates of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n with the continuous aeration system were 90 03 98 49 and 87 30 cm c respectively whereas those of the siphon aeration system were 80 96 96 76 80 58 cm d respectively siphon aeration system increases the nitrate nitrogen removal efficiency but decreases ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen removal performance artificial aeration supplies more oxygen to the cathode than siphon aeration and promotes nitrification principal nitrification processes typically occur under aerobic conditions cm a and cm c used artificial aeration to supply oxygen to the support layer or anode destroying the anaerobic environment this wasted energy impeded denitrification and reduced the removal of no3 n and tn antibiotics and cu2 were introduced in the third stage fig 3 shows that the removal rate first declines and then increases at this stage nh4 n and no2 n recovered more slowly than no3 n and tn indicating that denitrification was more sensitive to smx toxicity than nitrification smx inhibited the enzymes responsible for aerobic nitrosation and thus affected the nitrogen removal 3 2 microbial community analysis fig 4a depicts the composition of the cathodic microbial population at the phylum level the phylum bacteroidota predominates in aerobic bioreactors in which the mariculture effluent is treated and can remove phosphate and ammonia under aerobic conditions 43 bacteroidota is a relatively abundant microbial community in the ocean which can be more abundant as salinity increased 44 chloroflexi was a heterotrophic bacterial phylum essential for nitrogen degradation in biological wastewater treatment it is a significant bacterial group in the reactor that promotes sludge granulation and biofilm formation 45 as chloroflexi phylum can survive under any of the conditions in wastewater treatment plants because of their metabolic flexibility they have been often found in hypersaline wastewaters and marine environments 46 cyanobacteria were enriched in systems with additional microalgae the resistance of systems to high salinity conditions was improved 47 fig 4b depicts the relative abundance of the cathodic microbial populations at the genus level the effective performance of high salinity by microbial structure is due to the enrichment of salt tolerant functional microorganisms in the electroactive bacteria algae biofilm which achieved high removal efficiency of nitrogen smx copper ions for example the enrichment of chryseolinea and vicingus in high salinity wastewater treatment systems are major genera of nitrite oxidizing bacteria that can be effective in eliminating ammonia and cod under aerobic conditions 48 pseudooceanicola and hoeflea were also enriched in different systems with enrichment rates of 8 52 and 3 62 cm b 10 56 and 5 46 cm c and 12 45 and 7 45 cm d respectively furthermore marine microalgae bacteria effectively absorb and store chemicals such as inorganic phosphorus hoeflea were frequently detected in highly saline environments and known as salt tolerant bacteria 49 it has been reported that pseudooceanicola is resistant to antibiotics and has the potential to degrade harmful compounds such as heavy metals 50 sedimenticola is a sulfur oxidizing marine facultative anaerobe bacterium and play important roles in biodegradation at the high salinity 51 these results further verified that the efficiency of cw mfc system treating mariculture wastewater can be enhanced via construction of electroactive bacteria algae biofilm and enrichment of salt tolerant functional microorganisms fig 4c shows the structure of the anode microbial population euryarchaeota is a well known archaeal phylum that grows in high salinity and degrades organic waste while releasing methane proteobacteria are the most important bacteria involved in the biodegradation of nitrogen compound and organic waste proteobacteria was the most represented phylum with several functioning species in both unsalted and salted conditions 44 because of the anode enrichment by the closed circuit aggregate current the closed circuit systems cm c 16 71 and cm d 18 65 contain a larger proportion of proteobacteria than the open circuit systems cm a 14 24 and cm b 15 81 lu et al 52 reported that proteobacteria are stable under smx stress and the addition of an appropriate amount of smx promotes their development which also explains the improved antibiotic removal effectiveness of the closed circuit system halobacterota are salt tolerant bacteria which are frequently found in seawater they may break down organic materials in sewage and create acids leading to a microbial community that is more adapted to the high salinity mariculture environment planctomycetota are strictly anaerobic inorganic autotrophic bacteria known as anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria which convert ammonia and nitrite nitrogen into nitrogen gas and play an essential role in the removal of nitrogenous pollution 5 firmicutes the main phylum in anaerobic fermentation and responsible for hydrolysis and acidification produce budding spores to tolerate dehydration and harsh hypersaline conditions 53 fig 4d shows some of the dominant genera in the anode microbial population geobacteraceae uses organic carbon as an electron donor and nitrogen fixer to transport electrons to the surface of extracellular electrodes via cytochrome c proteins or nanowires 54 cm d 8 78 with siphon aeration contained a greater abundance of bacillus than cm c 7 26 with continuous aeration in the same closed circuit system bacillus can use inorganic electron donors to provide energy to denitrifying polyphosphoric bacteria which can be more highly enriched in a closed circuit and siphon aeration system compared with the other systems the cm d system was enriched in electrogenic bacteria such as geobacteraceae 9 47 and pseudomonas 2 54 the biofilm of electroactive bacteria algae grew more stably in high salinity environments leading to the enrichment of electrogenic bacteria and phosphate accumulating organisms and thus to increasing electricity production and wastewater treatment efficiency of systems based on the above microbial community analysis the microbial interaction for cm d system to remove pollutants was proposed in fig 5 49 51 aerobic nitrification and dissimilation are the primary processes in the cathode area bacteria use o2 generated by microalgae photosynthesis and no3 n in wastewater as electron acceptors and e and h transferred from anode for oxidation or nitrification the reduction pathways of cu2 was achieved by desulfomonile in the cathode in anaerobic conditions by decomposing organic matter in wastewater the anode extracellular respiratory bacteria create e and h which are transported to the cathode to encourage the completion of the denitrification reaction in the cathode and boost sulfur reducing bacteria in anode 53 54 3 3 technical and economic feasibility and capacity performance the primary expenses of the entire experimental system were construction and operation costs most expenses were for materials such as activated sludge activated carbon pebbles carbon fabric plastic drums and wire resistors the total cost of these items was 413 23 for a system with a 200 l capacity operational expenditures mainly consisted of electricity and maintenance charges newton s law states that it takes 9800 j of effort to raise 1 m3 of water by 1 m assuming the pump s motor efficiency was 56 the motor must burn 17 5 kj because 1 kwh 3600 kj the feed pump consumed 4 9 10 3 kwh m 3 the power consumption was calculated using a uniform electricity price of 0 12 kwh based on jiangmen s average and peak industrial energy demand the cost of pumping power was 5 88 10 4 m 3 of wastewater the electromagnetic air pump had an operating power of 0 035 kw the aeration pump required 4 5 10 3 kwh to treat 1 m 3 of water resulting in a power cost of 5 4 10 4 m 3 siphon aeration saves the power consumption when compared to the artificial aeration system it only needs to calculate the power consumption of the peristaltic pump is 5 88 10 4 m 3 while the total power consumption of the artificial aeration system is 11 28 10 4 m 3 saving 47 87 because seawater eroded parts of the systems causing blockage and degradation several parts need to be replaced and cleaned every three years every three years update the activated carbon carbon cloth wires and resistors consequently the annual maintenance cost will be 11 64 biodegradation in combination with microalgae wastewater treatment allows for the conversion of pollutants into commercially beneficial growth masses such as fertilizers biofuels animal feed and pharmaceuticals table 2 however several significant technical and economic obstacles remain in enriching microalgae and functional bacteria in wetland systems for engineering applications electroactive bacterial algae biofilm formation parameters should be modified by altering factors such as light inoculation program hydraulic residence duration and so on furthermore the building cost of an electrochemical system is relatively high which is reflected in construction materials and self monitoring equipment which must be regulated for practical applications in conclusion the tf cw mfc system with an electroactive bacterial algae biofilm had benefits such as low energy demand good treatment effect safety and no pollution which can realize a profitable situation of economic and environmental benefits for the mariculture industry despite the need for further study to increase its efficiency and economic viability 4 conclusions 1 the coordinated activity of electroactive bacteria and algae significantly enhances microbial adaptation in high salinity wastewater settings and increases the abundance of marine salt tolerant bacteria in the microbial community including marinobacter 7 93 muricauda 10 86 and xanthomarina 13 62 2 siphon aeration minimizes the energy loss and boosts microbial activity the marine microalgae bacteria pseudooceanicola 12 45 and hoeflea 7 45 electricity producing bacteria geobacteraceae 9 47 and pseudomonas 2 54 are significantly enriched improving the removal rate of microbial nitrogen and phosphorus accelerating the removal of antibiotics and heavy metals 3 based on the results of economic analyses the pilot system has a low daily energy consumption and provides a technically and economically viable treatment option for mariculture wastewater 4 future studies could focus on applying tf cw mfc system for wastewater treatment at high temperature conditions reducing system start up time enhancing electroactive bacteria algae activity and lowering costs credit authorship contribution statement tw and yl

corresponding authors constructed wetland microbial fuel cells cw mfc and aeration technology are typically used for the treatment of mariculture wastewater with a low carbon nitrogen ratio and high salinity however salt inhibition limits their efficiency here based on cw mfc an electroactive bacteria algae biofilm and siphon aeration technology were employed in a pilot study to validate their technical and economic feasibility the system yielded average removal efficiencies of 80 99 1 3 92 59 3 13 94 03 5 11 97 38 3 62 and 95 95 2 59 respectively for chemical oxygen demand total phosphorus

extracellular respiratory bacteria geobacteraceae 9 47 and pseudomonas 2 54 and microalgae bacteria pseudooceanicola 12 45 and hoeflea 7 45 were significantly enriched the energy consumption per ton of sewage treatment was 0 0045 kwh m 3 representing 47 87 lower costs than those related to traditional aeration these results proved the feasibility of cw mfc coupled with electroactive bacteria algae biofilm and siphon aeration tidal flow technology for mariculture wastewater treatment keywords mariculture wastewater constructed wetland microbial fuel cells electroactive bacteria algae biofilm microbial community economic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mariculture effluent is an organic wastewater with a low carbon nitrogen c n containing phosphate antibiotics and heavy metals in china the inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate concentrations of major marine aquaculture zones are 52 1 and 68 1 higher than the national standards respectively 1 the effective treatment of mariculture wastewater is of great significance to protect marine environment because of large load capacity and low cost constructed wetlands cws are popular for mariculture wastewater treatment wang et al 2 reported high removal rates of nh4 n and total nitrogen at 95 7 and 99 4 respectively when cws are used to treat saline wastewater however cws have shortcomings such as unstable and weak treatment efficiency 3 in several studies microbial fuel cells mfcs were coupled with cws to enhance the pollutant removal efficiency in cw mfc microorganisms decompose organic matter and generate electrons in the anaerobic anode region which are transferred to the cathode via an external circuit realizing energy recovery 4 nevertheless high salinity considerably affects microbial communities and limits the pollutant removal efficiency camacho et al 5 discovered that when the wastewater salinity was increased by the nacl concentration from 0 51 to 9 51 g l 1 the voltage was enhanced and the best salinity concentration to voltage was 4 5 g l 1 however higher salinity levels caused the opposite effect thus improving the efficiency of cw mfc systems under high salinity environments is necessary previous studies proved that bacteria algae biofilms can better adapt to high salinity environment 6 the symbiotic association between marine microalgae and microorganisms decreases the salt impact it has been reported that high salinity encouraged bacteria to secrete more indole 3 acetic acid in the bacteria algae system which could be metabolized by algae and then improve algae growth and lipid production the algae and bacteria can form a favorable symbiotic association under the salty conditions the salt tolerance of marine microalgae makes the bacteria algae system adjust to the inhibitory effect of a high salinity environment these aspects partially contributed to the better overall performance and stability of bacteria algae system under high salinity conditions 7 besides bacteria algae biofilms easily maintain the ph balance of system thus improving the pollutant removal efficiency of system moreover when bacteria algae biofilms were coupled with the mfcs algae and bacteria gradually adhered on the electrode to form an electroactive bacteria algae biofilm wrapped in extracellular polysaccharide as a communication channel for intercellular electron transfer and interactions 8 thus algae bacteria biofilms can improve the cw mfc system in fact some researches on the construction and effect of electroactive bacteria algae biofilm have already been made for example wang et al 9 reported that the synergistic metabolism of electroactive bacteria algae biofilm leads to the enrichment of electroactive bacteria and microalgae and improves the efficiency of the cw mfc treatment of freshwater aquaculture wastewater however there is rare research on the high salinity wastewater treatment via the enhancement of cw mfcs with bacteria algae biofilms salinity has an important effect on microorganisms the construction of electroactive bacteria algae film in the high salinity wastewater and its effect needs to be further studied on the other hand appropriate aeration supplies oxygen to the cathode and boosts the formation of electroactive bacteria algae biofilms the traditional continuous aeration approach consumes high amounts of energy and does not create alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions to complete the nitrification and denitrification processes fortunately this problem can be solved with siphon aeration tidal flow constructed wetlands tf cw can enrich microorganism based on the generation of alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions thus improving pollutants degradation 10 11 zhang et al 12 demonstrated that tf cw mfc increases denitrification and decreases methane emissions in wastewater with a low carbon nitrogen ratio as the water level rises and falls a contact empty tidal cycle is generated which boosts the cathode microbial activity and wastewater pollutant removal however the use of electroactive biofilms coupled with the siphon aeration technique in cw mfc to treat mariculture wastewater has rarely been reported this study innovatively constructed salt tolerant electroactive bacteria algae biofilm to enhance the efficiency of cw mfc systems moreover siphon aeration tidal flow technology was coupled and such a system was applied in the treatment of mariculture wastewater in pilot scale pollutant removal efficiency microbial process and economic analysis were focused it aims to explore the technical and economic feasibility of electroactive bacteria algae technology for water treatment of mariculture the results provide a theoretical basis and a technological path for mariculture wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of cw mfc systems fig 1 depicts a unique device construction for the cw mfc system all four experimental devices were built using plastic barrels with a total capacity of 200 l the devices were divided into three portions from the bottom to the top pebbles were deposited at the bottom as a support layer of approximately 40 cm the middle layer was filled with activated carbon and the uppermost layer was the outflow layer carbon cloth with a thickness of 5 cm weight of 50 g m 2 and diameter of 50 cm was used for both the anode and cathode areas cm c and cm d were built as a closed circuit cw mfc system by connecting the anode and cathode with brass wire an external 1000 ω resistor and a voltage smart monitor to both ends of the resistor for continuous monitoring of the closed circuit voltage 2 2 operation of cw mfc systems continuous aeration was carried out at a rate of 1000 ml min 1 in the top layers of cm a and cm c and inverted u shaped siphons were fitted for the treated water to exit at the cathodes of cm b and cm d when the maximum water level was reached the siphon was automatically activated water was promptly drained from the cathode chamber and its level recovered to the height of the siphon input in addition marine microalgae were inoculated in the cathode portions of cm b cm c and cm d to form an electroactive bacterial algae biofilm system the experiment was conducted using four experimental groups four experimental control groups cm a cm b cm c and cm d were assembled for this study the temperature was maintained at 23 c mariculture wastewater is a kind of low c n wastewater with the value of 2 1 7 1 1 so synthetic mariculture wastewater with a low c n was provided as showed in table 1 sea salt generated from south china sea with major components of nacl k ca2 mg2 were used to simulate the seawater with a salinity of 30 for continuous operation of the experiment the influent salinity was progressively increased from 0 to 30 an average salinity of the world s oceans to ensure that the microorganisms could gradually acclimatize for biofilm formation 2 3 sludge injection and electroactive bacterial algae enrichment fresh sludge was purchased from a wastewater treatment plant and seeded uniformly on the carbon cloth of the cathode with concentration of 13 60 0 25 g vss l 1 13 granular sludge was domesticated in diameter of 2 0 3 0 mm by gradually increasing the influent salinity to reduce the negative effect of high salinity on bacterial growth marine microalgae were obtained from shangchuan island jiangmen guangdong province china and cultivated in an intelligent light incubator with a light dark time ratio of 12 12 and a 22 c temperature controlled incubation according to high throughput sequencing the dominant genera were hoeflea and pseudooceanicola firstly the microalgae were cultured under low light until they reached the logarithmic growth phase in guillard f 2 medium 14 after the logarithmic growth period half of the algae were transferred to a new medium and then culture up to the logarithmic growth period repeating the culture transfer step by step throughout the expansion culture the algal medium was shaken three times a day to ensure the equal dispersion of algae and to prevent cell sedimentation algal development was frequently checked using an optical microscope olympus ckx53 tokyo japan to ensure adequate growth finally the algal solution was expanded to a capacity of 2000 ml algae from the logarithmic development stage were cultured rinsed multiple times with synthetic saltwater table 1 and centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 rpm cr22g hitachi koki co ltd kyoto japan this process was repeated three times the algae were evenly dispersed over the cathode surface of the three experimental groups cm b cm c and cm d and mixed with granular sludge to generate electroactive bacterial algae biofilms under the influence of mfc 2 4 sampling and testing methods water samples were collected from the uppermost layer of the system filtered with a 0 45 μm filter membrane and then subjected to testing the wastewater testing methods and parameters were analyzed based on apha and epa guidelines the ph was measured using a ph meter phs 3e lei magi shanghai china dissolved oxygen do was measured using a portable dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach usa soluble cod was determined using lianhua technology s rapid detector and tp no2 n no3 n tn nh4 n were measured by uv spectrophotometer uv 1900i shimadzu kyoto japan using standard operation methods cu2 were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aa6200 shimadzu kyoto japan the sulfamethoxazole smx was determined using high performance liquid chromatography 1200 agilent usa the chromatographic column was c18 the detection wavelength was set at 258 nm and the monitoring time duration 3 min the organic phase of the hplc is methanol and the aqueous phase is 0 1 acetic acid water a digital voltmeter using an at89c51 microcontroller and china mobile s onenet iot interface was designed to continually monitor the voltage and output data online at the end of the experiment samples of anode sludge and cathode electroactive bacteria algae biofilm were collected to better understand the effects of electroactive bacterial algal systems on the composition of microbial communities in biofilm carriers the samples were washed in an ultrasonic cleaner for 30 min then filtered through sterile 0 22 μm filter paper and finally freeze dried under vacuum and crushed to extract the dna to analyze the composition and differences in microbial communities on biofilm carriers the fastdnatm spin kit qiagen ca usa was used to extract the sample dna three times the samples were subjected to 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing by the illumina hiseq2500 pe250 platform for high throughput sequencing 15 additional information regarding polymerase chain reaction and sequencing can be found in a previous study 16 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall treatment performance the cm d experimental group exhibited the best removal efficiency for various pollutants the average removal rates of cod tp tn smx and cu2 by cm d were 80 99 1 3 90 81 5 67 94 82 4 74 97 38 3 62 and 95 95 2 59 respectively with an average voltage of 354 23 mv 3 1 1 removal of smx fig 2a depicts the smx treatment efficiencies of the four systems with the average removal efficiencies of 83 65 3 23 cm a 87 66 5 12 cm b 93 33 4 59 cm c and 97 38 3 13 cm d respectively the nitrogen and carbon of smx can be utilized by microalgae growth in the microalgae bacteria system and antibiotic breakdown is promoted 17 the co metabolic pathway of smx by microalgae and bacteria was proposed involving the breakdown of side chain reactions of the amine group on the benzene ring oxidation and hydroxylation and pterin related conjugation 18 based on the microbial community marine microalgae such as pseudooceanicola and hoeflea are enriched in the cathodic layer of cm b 11 83 cm c 16 02 and cm d 19 90 microalgae had a selective ability of the bacterial community 19 resulting in the formation of a more stable state moreover some organic substances released by chlorella demonstrated antibacterial activity against specific bacteria besides proteobacteria have been shown to reduce the virulence of smx by synergistic metabolism 20 hence the bacterial algal system contributes to smx breakdown and microalgae development furthermore the closed circuit system cm c 93 33 4 59 and cm d 97 38 3 13 outperformed the open circuit device cm a 83 65 3 23 and cm b 87 66 5 12 in terms of smx elimination the role of cw mfc in antibiotic removal has been studied previously on one hand microorganisms employ electrons to break down complex compounds such as smx into short chain organics which are subsequently oxidized by electroactive bacteria 21 on the other hand voltage and current enhance the antibiotic adsorption on the electrode surface in the mfc 22 microbial community analysis revealed that the closed circuit systems cm c 16 02 10 52 and cm d 19 90 12 01 contained more marine microalgae and electroactive bacteria respectively than the open circuit systems cm a 0 91 4 67 and cm b 11 83 5 74 under electrochemical stimulation the enrichment of marine microalgal and electroactive bacteria can be increased resulting in a high rate of antibiotic removal from wastewater in addition the results of previous research showed that extracellular respiratory bacteria erb can be introduced via bacteria algae symbiosis and mfc coupling systems and erb have a high metabolic efficiency owing to direct interspecies electron transfer 23 direct interspecies electron transfer can transport electrons through conductive mycelia and direct touch enhancing the metabolic rate and the efficiency of electron transfer by working with erb to increase the removal efficiency of pollutants microalgae compensate for the lack of an electroactive biofilm 9 the removal efficiency of cm d 97 38 3 13 with siphon aeration was higher than that of cm c 93 33 4 59 with continuous aeration chen et al 24 discovered that extracellular polymers absorb a small amount of smx and majority of the smx is biodegraded by anoxic microorganisms continuous artificial aeration destroys the anaerobic environment in the anode layer and decreases the smx removal whereas siphon aeration provides an alternating aerobic anoxic environment for microbial smx removal based on this experiment the tf cw mfc with the electroactive bacterial algae biofilm achieved the better smx removal efficiency 3 1 2 removal of copper ions the removal efficiencies for heavy metal copper ions in the four experimental groups were cm a 69 94 4 46 cm b 84 25 8 02 cm c 89 97 5 6 and cm d 95 95 5 29 as shown in fig 2b the cu2 effluent concentration in cm a 1 21 0 23 mg l 1 without marine microalgae was much greater than that in cm b 0 64 0 29 mg l 1 cm c 0 40 0 21 mg l 1 and cm d 0 16 0 09 mg l 1 with marine microalgae heavy metals have a high binding affinity to the cell wall of microalgae 25 carbohydrates proteins and lipids are the primary components of microalgal cell walls and include several functional groups such as carboxyl cooh hydroxyl oh phosphate po3h amino nh2 and sulfhydryl so3h 26 which are always negatively charged on the cell wall allowing them to easily bind heavy metal ions thus the bacterial algae biofilm system was more effective than the bacterial biofilm system concerning heavy metals removal the copper ion removal effectiveness of cm c 89 97 5 60 and cm d 95 95 5 29 in the closed circuit system was greater than that of cm a 69 94 4 46 and cm b 84 25 8 02 in the open circuit system because copper ion reduction occurs after electrons are generated in the anode chamber via an external connection to the cathode chamber in the cw mfc system 27 the effluent also contains precipitates because of the cyclic conversion of sulfide and sulfate in the cw mfc system sulfate reducing bacteria reduce sulfate ions under anaerobic conditions producing precipitates such as cus and sulfur monomers in the solution 28 microbial community analysis revealed that cm c 13 02 and cm d 11 52 in the closed circuit system were more enriched in sedimenticola spp linked to sulfur removal than cm a 8 03 and cm b 5 46 in the open circuit system supporting the previous hypothesis although both closed circuit systems showed a high copper ion removal efficiency the siphon aeration device cm d 95 95 5 29 outperformed the continuous aeration device cm c 89 97 5 6 compared with artificial continuous aeration siphon aeration provided an alternating aerobic anaerobic environment for copper ion removal to ensure the electrochemical reduction in the anode chamber therefore the tf cw mfc system with the electroactive bacterial algae biofilm exhibits the best cu2 removal effect 3 1 3 electrical production performance after the experimental system was stabilized the average voltage of cm d was 354 23 mv which was higher than that of cm c 208 73 mv the voltage of the cw mfc system with tidal flow through siphon aeration was significantly greater than that with artificial aeration the do in the effluent of cm c 7 03 mg l 1 with continuous aeration was consistently higher than that in cm d 6 98 mg l 1 with siphon aeration the artificial aeration in the cathode chamber introduced high concentrations of oxygen but if the aeration time is extended the number of electrons produced by the anode and the oxygen atoms in the cathode do not match properly 29 siphon aeration creates an anaerobic aerobic environment which is needed to maintain an electron balance between the cathode and anode 30 this explains why the voltage in the siphon aeration system is much higher than that of the artificial aeration system furthermore the microalgae can produce oxygen at the cathode via photosynthesis promoting pollution removal and electron transfer in the mfc and thus greatly increasing the output voltage of mfc fig 2e shows the power generation performance during the 120 days of continuous experiments in the early stage the ionic strength of the electrolyte increased and the internal resistance decreased with increasing salinity thus improving the electron transfer rate and electricity production performance in the lower salinity range 31 meanwhile when the salinity reached 20 the voltage started to drop with the increasing salinity high salinity causes an osmotic pressure gap resulting in the inhibition or killing of several bacteria due to cytoplasmic breakdown 32 however when subjected to salt and electrochemical stimulation the microbial diversity declines the concentration of specialized species increases and the microbial community eventually adapts to salinity and promotes electron production and transmission 33 the addition of smx and cu2 in the third stage of the experiment caused a short period of voltage fluctuation with an average voltage of 137 mv cm c and 306 mv cm d respectively which was lower than that in the following stabilization period the fluctuation was caused by electroactive bacteria which are extremely sensitive to chemicals such as antibiotics and metals and inhibit the electrochemical activity metabolic activity and biomass of microorganisms the self recovery ability of the electroactive bacteria increases as the microorganisms adapt to the environment resulting in microbial communities and voltage stabilization furthermore heavy metal containing wastewater has a high redox potential and may be utilized as a cathodic electrolyte for metal reduction and treatment 34 thus cu2 boosts the solution conductivity while decreasing the charge transfer resistance as a result the voltages in the later stage are larger 3 1 4 cod removal efficiency fig 2c depicts the cod elimination efficiency for each of the three stages of the experiment the highest removal efficiency of cm a 54 63 cm b 73 68 cm c 73 75 and cm d 81 89 were observed the cw mfc system with tidal flow had a higher cod removal efficiency than the other three groups on the other hand the ability of microorganisms to reduce cod varies with the salinity high salinities were observed from days 10th to 40th and the rise in osmotic pressure easily caused cytoplasmic breakdown and death of microorganisms 35 it also restricted their activity resulting in a decrease in the cod removal efficiency during this period the closed circuit mfc system improved pollutant removal efficiency after the experimental system was stabilized the average cod removal rates of cm c 69 51 8 37 and cm d 80 99 1 3 were significantly higher than those of the cm a 52 84 2 59 and cm b 69 53 4 4 the results of the microbial community analysis revealed that the number of marine salt tolerant bacteria such as muricauda and xanthomarina in cm c 17 89 and cm d 24 48 in the closed circuit system was greater than that in cm a 14 48 and cm b 21 86 in the open circuit system electrochemical techniques can boost the development and enrichment of salt tolerant bacteria to increase cod removal furthermore chloride ions are transformed to chlorine at the anode and react with water molecules to generate hypochlorous acid which is a powerful oxidant that indirectly increases the cod removal efficiency 36 aeration altered the living environment of microorganisms resulting in varying treatment effects the effluent do content of cm a 7 12 mg l 1 cm b 6 87 mg l 1 cm c 7 03 mg l 1 and cm d 6 98 mg l 1 were consistently lower than the influent do concentration 7 26 mg l 1 aerobic bacteria degraded the organic matter and nitrogen when the wetland was flooded lowering the do content of the effluent the cod removal rate of the siphon system in cm b 69 53 4 4 and cm d 80 99 1 3 is consistently higher than the continuous aeration system in cm a 52 84 2 59 and cm c 69 51 8 37 because the strong artificial aeration diffuses oxygen to the support layer and even the anode destroying the anaerobic environment and thus affecting organic matter degradation by anaerobic ways consequently compared with artificial continuous aeration the siphon aeration technology saved energy boosted microbial activity and provided an aerobic aerobic environment for microbial growth 3 1 5 biological phosphorus removal fig 2d shows the tp removal performance of the four devices following experimental stabilization the average tp removal rates for the four systems were 61 98 3 51 cm a 74 67 7 79 cm b 82 75 5 67 cm c and 90 81 5 67 cm d in general phosphorus can be removed by both abiotic phosphorus precipitation and biotic phosphorus assimilation whereas orthophosphate precipitation primarily occurs in the ph range of 9 11 37 the ph range in this experiment was 6 7 7 4 therefore the abiotic phosphorus removal was considered negligible traditional biological phosphorus removal processes are sensitive to salinity marine algae can grow under high salinity conditions enriching salt tolerant bacteria and enhancing phosphorus removal efficiency phosphorus is an important nutrient for microalgae and is involved in several intracellular processes such as information storage and signaling 38 k2hpo4 can directly enter microalgal cells directly through transporters within the cell membrane boosting phosphorus removal based on the experimental results cm c 82 75 5 67 and cm d 90 81 5 67 with closed circuit had greater tp removal efficiency than cm a 61 98 3 51 and cm b 74 67 7 79 in the open circuit the mfc boosted the synergistic metabolism of bacterial algae biofilms improving the tp elimination by microorganisms bacteria algae coupled mfcs significantly altered the microbial community structure increased electroactive bacteria and microorganisms involved in pollutant breakdown the symbiosis between microalgae and electroactive bacteria protected the algae from damage chemicals in the wastewater and improved pollutant removal wang et al 39 demonstrated that the microalgal based pmfc was cost effective for domestic wastewater treatment in which achieved up to 93 2 of cod 95 9 of nh4 n 95 1 of tn and 82 7 of po4 3 p removal efficiency as well as 466 9 mw m 3 of maximum power density the experiment results indicate that cm d 90 81 5 67 with siphon aeration showed a much higher average tp removal efficiency than cm c 82 75 5 67 this was due to the siphon s alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions which facilitated biological phosphorus removal by phosphorus polymerizing bacteria 40 frequent backwashing is essential for phosphorus removal in biofilter systems 41 in this experiment the siphon was spontaneously triggered when the water level reached the top of the spout the water in the cathode was quickly emptied by the siphon outlet the water level was dropped to the height of the siphon entrance ensuring a particular frequency of backwashing boosting the phosphorus removal performance 3 1 6 denitrification efficiency fig 3 depicts the comparing of the nitrogen removal efficiency of the four reactors the reason of the poor tn removal efficiency in the first stage was primarily due to the salinity change which made it difficult for the microbial adaption and even resulted in the death of bacteria due to the impact of osmotic pressure after the experimental system was stabilized the average tn removal efficiency of each reactor was 66 88 4 54 cm a 78 08 6 57 cm b 87 89 6 09 cm c and 94 82 4 74 cm d respectively the removal of nh4 n and no2 n mainly depends on microbial nitrification and the no3 n removal is primarily based on denitrification the comparisons of fig 3a b and c reveals the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n and no2 n in the first stage were 21 56 and 28 82 cm a 18 34 and 40 10 cm b 48 67 and 65 61 cm c 42 92 and 54 99 cm d they were lower than the no3 n removal efficiencies 26 84 31 65 38 99 and 46 87 respectively because nitrifying bacteria are more sensitive to salinity shock than denitrifying bacteria and anaerobic bacteria can better adapt to sudden salinity changes than aerobic bacteria 42 in contrast to the high salinity inhibition of the cm a and cm b systems coupling with an electroactive bacteria algae biofilm in cm c and cm d promoted microalgae and bacterial cell tolerance to high salinity the closed circuit cw mfc provides a mixed aerobic and anaerobic environment and produces an electron flow that enhances pollutant removal and eliminates issues related to an insufficient carbon supply during denitrification 12 thereby improving the denitrification efficiency after the systems stabilized the average removal rates of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n with the continuous aeration system were 90 03 98 49 and 87 30 cm c respectively whereas those of the siphon aeration system were 80 96 96 76 80 58 cm d respectively siphon aeration system increases the nitrate nitrogen removal efficiency but decreases ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen removal performance artificial aeration supplies more oxygen to the cathode than siphon aeration and promotes nitrification principal nitrification processes typically occur under aerobic conditions cm a and cm c used artificial aeration to supply oxygen to the support layer or anode destroying the anaerobic environment this wasted energy impeded denitrification and reduced the removal of no3 n and tn antibiotics and cu2 were introduced in the third stage fig 3 shows that the removal rate first declines and then increases at this stage nh4 n and no2 n recovered more slowly than no3 n and tn indicating that denitrification was more sensitive to smx toxicity than nitrification smx inhibited the enzymes responsible for aerobic nitrosation and thus affected the nitrogen removal 3 2 microbial community analysis fig 4a depicts the composition of the cathodic microbial population at the phylum level the phylum bacteroidota predominates in aerobic bioreactors in which the mariculture effluent is treated and can remove phosphate and ammonia under aerobic conditions 43 bacteroidota is a relatively abundant microbial community in the ocean which can be more abundant as salinity increased 44 chloroflexi was a heterotrophic bacterial phylum essential for nitrogen degradation in biological wastewater treatment it is a significant bacterial group in the reactor that promotes sludge granulation and biofilm formation 45 as chloroflexi phylum can survive under any of the conditions in wastewater treatment plants because of their metabolic flexibility they have been often found in hypersaline wastewaters and marine environments 46 cyanobacteria were enriched in systems with additional microalgae the resistance of systems to high salinity conditions was improved 47 fig 4b depicts the relative abundance of the cathodic microbial populations at the genus level the effective performance of high salinity by microbial structure is due to the enrichment of salt tolerant functional microorganisms in the electroactive bacteria algae biofilm which achieved high removal efficiency of nitrogen smx copper ions for example the enrichment of chryseolinea and vicingus in high salinity wastewater treatment systems are major genera of nitrite oxidizing bacteria that can be effective in eliminating ammonia and cod under aerobic conditions 48 pseudooceanicola and hoeflea were also enriched in different systems with enrichment rates of 8 52 and 3 62 cm b 10 56 and 5 46 cm c and 12 45 and 7 45 cm d respectively furthermore marine microalgae bacteria effectively absorb and store chemicals such as inorganic phosphorus hoeflea were frequently detected in highly saline environments and known as salt tolerant bacteria 49 it has been reported that pseudooceanicola is resistant to antibiotics and has the potential to degrade harmful compounds such as heavy metals 50 sedimenticola is a sulfur oxidizing marine facultative anaerobe bacterium and play important roles in biodegradation at the high salinity 51 these results further verified that the efficiency of cw mfc system treating mariculture wastewater can be enhanced via construction of electroactive bacteria algae biofilm and enrichment of salt tolerant functional microorganisms fig 4c shows the structure of the anode microbial population euryarchaeota is a well known archaeal phylum that grows in high salinity and degrades organic waste while releasing methane proteobacteria are the most important bacteria involved in the biodegradation of nitrogen compound and organic waste proteobacteria was the most represented phylum with several functioning species in both unsalted and salted conditions 44 because of the anode enrichment by the closed circuit aggregate current the closed circuit systems cm c 16 71 and cm d 18 65 contain a larger proportion of proteobacteria than the open circuit systems cm a 14 24 and cm b 15 81 lu et al 52 reported that proteobacteria are stable under smx stress and the addition of an appropriate amount of smx promotes their development which also explains the improved antibiotic removal effectiveness of the closed circuit system halobacterota are salt tolerant bacteria which are frequently found in seawater they may break down organic materials in sewage and create acids leading to a microbial community that is more adapted to the high salinity mariculture environment planctomycetota are strictly anaerobic inorganic autotrophic bacteria known as anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria which convert ammonia and nitrite nitrogen into nitrogen gas and play an essential role in the removal of nitrogenous pollution 5 firmicutes the main phylum in anaerobic fermentation and responsible for hydrolysis and acidification produce budding spores to tolerate dehydration and harsh hypersaline conditions 53 fig 4d shows some of the dominant genera in the anode microbial population geobacteraceae uses organic carbon as an electron donor and nitrogen fixer to transport electrons to the surface of extracellular electrodes via cytochrome c proteins or nanowires 54 cm d 8 78 with siphon aeration contained a greater abundance of bacillus than cm c 7 26 with continuous aeration in the same closed circuit system bacillus can use inorganic electron donors to provide energy to denitrifying polyphosphoric bacteria which can be more highly enriched in a closed circuit and siphon aeration system compared with the other systems the cm d system was enriched in electrogenic bacteria such as geobacteraceae 9 47 and pseudomonas 2 54 the biofilm of electroactive bacteria algae grew more stably in high salinity environments leading to the enrichment of electrogenic bacteria and phosphate accumulating organisms and thus to increasing electricity production and wastewater treatment efficiency of systems based on the above microbial community analysis the microbial interaction for cm d system to remove pollutants was proposed in fig 5 49 51 aerobic nitrification and dissimilation are the primary processes in the cathode area bacteria use o2 generated by microalgae photosynthesis and no3 n in wastewater as electron acceptors and e and h transferred from anode for oxidation or nitrification the reduction pathways of cu2 was achieved by desulfomonile in the cathode in anaerobic conditions by decomposing organic matter in wastewater the anode extracellular respiratory bacteria create e and h which are transported to the cathode to encourage the completion of the denitrification reaction in the cathode and boost sulfur reducing bacteria in anode 53 54 3 3 technical and economic feasibility and capacity performance the primary expenses of the entire experimental system were construction and operation costs most expenses were for materials such as activated sludge activated carbon pebbles carbon fabric plastic drums and wire resistors the total cost of these items was 413 23 for a system with a 200 l capacity operational expenditures mainly consisted of electricity and maintenance charges newton s law states that it takes 9800 j of effort to raise 1 m3 of water by 1 m assuming the pump s motor efficiency was 56 the motor must burn 17 5 kj because 1 kwh 3600 kj the feed pump consumed 4 9 10 3 kwh m 3 the power consumption was calculated using a uniform electricity price of 0 12 kwh based on jiangmen s average and peak industrial energy demand the cost of pumping power was 5 88 10 4 m 3 of wastewater the electromagnetic air pump had an operating power of 0 035 kw the aeration pump required 4 5 10 3 kwh to treat 1 m 3 of water resulting in a power cost of 5 4 10 4 m 3 siphon aeration saves the power consumption when compared to the artificial aeration system it only needs to calculate the power consumption of the peristaltic pump is 5 88 10 4 m 3 while the total power consumption of the artificial aeration system is 11 28 10 4 m 3 saving 47 87 because seawater eroded parts of the systems causing blockage and degradation several parts need to be replaced and cleaned every three years every three years update the activated carbon carbon cloth wires and resistors consequently the annual maintenance cost will be 11 64 biodegradation in combination with microalgae wastewater treatment allows for the conversion of pollutants into commercially beneficial growth masses such as fertilizers biofuels animal feed and pharmaceuticals table 2 however several significant technical and economic obstacles remain in enriching microalgae and functional bacteria in wetland systems for engineering applications electroactive bacterial algae biofilm formation parameters should be modified by altering factors such as light inoculation program hydraulic residence duration and so on furthermore the building cost of an electrochemical system is relatively high which is reflected in construction materials and self monitoring equipment which must be regulated for practical applications in conclusion the tf cw mfc system with an electroactive bacterial algae biofilm had benefits such as low energy demand good treatment effect safety and no pollution which can realize a profitable situation of economic and environmental benefits for the mariculture industry despite the need for further study to increase its efficiency and economic viability 4 conclusions 1 the coordinated activity of electroactive bacteria and algae significantly enhances microbial adaptation in high salinity wastewater settings and increases the abundance of marine salt tolerant bacteria in the microbial community including marinobacter 7 93 muricauda 10 86 and xanthomarina 13 62 2 siphon aeration minimizes the energy loss and boosts microbial activity the marine microalgae bacteria pseudooceanicola 12 45 and hoeflea 7 45 electricity producing bacteria geobacteraceae 9 47 and pseudomonas 2 54 are significantly enriched improving the removal rate of microbial nitrogen and phosphorus accelerating the removal of antibiotics and heavy metals 3 based on the results of economic analyses the pilot system has a low daily energy consumption and provides a technically and economically viable treatment option for mariculture wastewater 4 future studies could focus on applying tf cw mfc system for wastewater treatment at high temperature conditions reducing system start up time enhancing electroactive bacteria algae activity and lowering costs credit authorship contribution statement tw and yl

12503,in this study efficient degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx by coupling dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma and mno2 fe3o4 cellulose acetate mno2 fe3o4 ca film catalyst was investigated sem xrd ft ir and xps were carried out to confirm the successful preparation of the mno2 fe3o4 ca film the optimal constitution of mno2 fe3o4 and ca was evaluated according to the smx degradation under different conditions of the prepared films when 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca films were added into the dbd system the removal rate of smx could reach 93 55 experiments on the effect of the initial ph value of the solution indicated that the smx degradation was better under both neutral and alkaline solution conditions mechanism analysis show that oh o2 and 1o2 were involved in the degradation of smx the mno2 fe3o4 ca catalyst could burst fenton reaction and promote ozone decomposition and accordingly generated more reactive oxygen species ros responsible for the increase of the smx degradation the cyclic experiments showed that film had good repeatability and stability four routes of smx degradation were given according to the byproducts analysis and the toxicity was evaluated graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sulfamethoxazole dielectric barrier discharge plasma mno2 fe3o4 ca catalysis reactive oxygen species data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sulfonamides have been widely used in the treatment of various human and animal diseases as one of sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole smx has strong antibacterial activity especially effective against staphylococcus and escherichia coli 1 due to the large consumption improper using and disposition smx has become a kind of common pollutant existed in water environments which accordingly lead to a potential threat to ecological conditions as well as human health 2 3 hence there is a need to develop more efficient methods to decompose smx emissions from various sources as a kind of advanced oxidation technology aot non thermal plasma ntp has shown enormous potential in environmental pollution remediation 4 6 among kinds of ntp dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma has multiple advantages including ease of operation stable discharge state high concentration ozone generation and effective treatment for the organic compounds etc therefore the dbd plasma technology has been applied in the sewage remediation extensively 7 8 in dbd process the high voltage applied to the electrode can ionize the gas present in the discharge channel and many kinds of physical and chemical effects are subsequently formed 9 such as the high energy electrons ultraviolet irradiation shock wave various reactive oxygen species ros e g o3 oh h2o2 and 1o2 etc etc the coexistence of physical and chemical effects has a joint action in the treatment of refractory compounds 10 nevertheless the relative lower oxidation potential of h2o2 and o3 formed during the dbd process has restricted the application of the dbd plasma technology in pollutant effluents treatment in recent years the collaborative processes of dbd plasma and different catalysts have been widely investigated to improve the efficiency of different dbd process for the wastewater treatment 11 12 due to the higher production of the ozone in dbd system catalytic ozonation material has been identified as one kind effective catalyst to enhance the oh formation and organic compounds degradation among the reviewed catalytic ozonation studies mno2 nanoparticles have the advantages of high performance environmental friendliness simple preparation and stable structure 13 16 however the problem of uneasy separation and recovery limits its practical application therefore research and development of the mno2 based recyclable catalyst and apply it into the dbd process is a meaningful subject for enhancing the utilization potentiality of the dbd plasma technology in wastewater treatment the porous polymer film prepared by cellulose acetate ca has shown good mechanical properties highly water permeability and good reusability nano particles can also mix with the ca to prepare the composite films and the loaded nano particles exhibit uniform dispersion and complete structure 17 18 moreover ca can also provide active sites for the catalyst growth researches have proved the effectiveness of the ca based films for the organic compounds degradation the ca ce zr cu0 film catalyst was successfully synthesized and applied for 4 nitrophenol methylene blue and rhodamine b reduction in water by khan et al 19 the mno2 ca composite film prepared by peng et al showed great removal performance for the dye 20 our former research has proved that the combination of dbd and mno2 ca could enhance the degradation of smx 21 however h2o2 formed in the reaction system still has not been fully utilized in the plasma catalytic ozonation synergistic process which can be considered as a breakthrough for further development of the dbd plasma based technologies as h2o2 is the main participant of fenton reaction and oh can also be formed in the reaction so the fenton process and catalytic ozonation process can be utilized together to further improve the degradation efficiency fe3o4 is a kind of heterogeneous fenton reagent furthermore it has been proved that the fe3o4 could promote the oh generation through catalytic ozonation process and fenton reaction in the pulsed discharge plasma system 22 therefore the combination of mno2 and fe3o4 was considered in the study to trigger the catalytic ozonation and the fenton reaction simultaneously in the dbd plasma system then promote the production of ros and the removal of pollutants based on the above analysis the combined system of mno2 fe3o4 ca films and dbd plasma were set up and applied to degrade smx wastewater in this study mno2 fe3o4 ca film was prepared by combing the mno2 fe3o4 powder and the ca and the catalytic performance of the mno2 fe3o4 ca was denoted by comparing the degradation effect of smx in the dbd plasma system in the presence and absence of the catalyst the surface morphology and crystal structure of the mno2 fe3o4 ca film were analyzed through various characterization the optimal preparation parameters of the composite film was reviewed the stability of the composite films was evaluated through reusability test the possible degradation routes of smx were speculated according to the detected byproducts the toxicity assessment of the smx solutions before and after treatment were carried out to prove the degradation process and the catalytic mechanism and smx degradation process was also analyzed and summarized 2 experimental 2 1 experimental materials all the drugs used in the experiment are given in text s1 and used directly without purification 2 2 catalyst preparation mno2 fe3o4 powder was manufactured using the hydrothermal method 23 first mixing 2 78 g feso4 7h2o and 1 5 g polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp to 100 ml deionized water and left at 90 c for 1 h then dissolving 0 8 g naoh in 100 ml water and adding into the above 90 c solution stirred till to form green suspension next adding different kmno4 solutions into the suspension to achieve the certain ratios of iron and manganese the molar ratios of fe and mn is 1 1 2 1 3 1 and 4 1 respectively the dark brown precipitates could then be formed after a slow agitation finally the resulting precipitates were centrifuged after aging for 12 h and washed multiple times with deionized water and ethanol then grounded after vacuum drying at 50 c the pure fe3o4 and mno2 powder were also prepared according to the above steps by adjusting elemental constituent the preparation method of mno2 fe3o4 ca composite film was consistent with the method recorded in our former study 21 the photographs of different composite films are provided in fig s1 2 3 characterization characterization methods of different materials are provided in text s2 2 4 experimental system and analytical method the dbd plasma device used in this study was same as our previous research 24 25 and the combination method of the dbd and the catalyst was also referred to our former research 21 in the experiment the output voltage was set as 6 kv and the load gas capacity was 0 5 l min 1 the initial concentration of smx solution was 50 mg l 1 and the solution volume was 500 ml without adjustment the initial solution of smx had the ph of about 7 the total time of a single experiment was 1 h and the sampling interval was 15 min during the treatment the residual smx was detected by high performance liquid chromatography hplc as detailed in text s3 change of the initial smx solution was regulated with naoh 0 1 mol l 1 and hcl 0 1 mol l 1 solutions the degradation kinetics analysis of the smx was calculated by pseudo first order formula the synergistic factor sf was computed based on the calculated kinetic constant of the smx degradation in different reaction systems 26 as shown below 1 sf k dbd f fe 3 o 4 mno 2 ca k dbd k f fe 3 o 4 mno 2 ca where k dbd is the kinetic constant of smx degradation in the sole dbd plasma system k f is the kinetic constant of smx removal in the sole films adsorption system k dbd f is the kinetic constant of smx degradation by synergistic effect of dbd plasma and different composite films energy efficiency g50 g kwh 1 during smx degradation is computed by the following formula 2 g 50 0 5 c 0 f c s v t 50 where c 0 is the initial concentration mg l 1 f is the output frequency of the power supply khz c is sampling capacitance μf s is the area of the lissajous figure v is the volume of smx solution l t 50 is the time reached 50 of smx removal h uv vis spectrophotometer was used to scan the smx solution in the initial and degradation process and the degradation was monitored by observing the characteristic peaks the concentrations of o3 and h2o2 in liquid phase were detected by a portable ozone tester cy 1a shanghai haiheng and titanium sulfate method respectively the cod value in the solution was measured by a water quality tester 5b 3a beijing lianhua the formed active substances 1o2 and oh was analyzed by the electron spin resonance esr the intermediates produced during smx degradation were determined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms in addition toxicity assessment of smx and the possible intermediates was assessed using toxicity estimation software tool test in the study three parallel experiments were conducted under all reaction conditions to assure the reliability of the data and the error bar pairs are shown in the figures 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of different catalysts the sem and eds diagrams of different nanoparticles nps and films are shown in fig 1 the results in fig 1a shows that the prepared fe3o4 nps uniformly dispersed and exhibited a magnetic flower like structure fig 1b indicates that the nanoflower mno2 fe3o4 composite nps can be prepared by the hydrothermal method and mno2 exhibited a layered petal structure 27 from the sem of mno2 fe3o4 ca composite film shown in fig 1c the mno2 fe3o4 nps with flower shaped structure existed in the composite films the eds diagram fig 1d shows that the prepared mno2 fe3o4 ca composite film consisted of several elements including c o fe and mn the detailed eds mapping illustrated in fig 1e i also shows that the composite film consists of fe mn c and o elements and they were distributed across over the film the results of sem analysis show that mno2 fe3o4 ca film was successfully synthesized the xrd patterns of fe3o4 nps mno2 fe3o4 nps and mno2 fe3o4 ca film are shown in fig 2a in the xrd pattern of fe3o4 the characteristic peaks at 30 2 35 5 43 2 53 6 57 3 62 7 correspond to 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 crystal planes of pure fe3o4 respectively jcpds card no 19 0629 28 29 according to the jcpds card no 80 1098 the peaks at 2θ 22 220 37 2 211 42 6 301 and 56 4 600 belonged to the mno2 30 the peak of ca appeared at 2θ 18 30 the characteristic peaks at 22 41 2 and 46 4 corresponded to the mno2 crystal planes of 220 420 and 321 respectively 31 to sum up the characteristic peaks of both mno2 and fe3o4 could be seen in the xrd spectrum of mno2 fe3o4 ca film which indicated the successful preparation of the composite film the detailed chemical constitution of the mno2 fe3o4 ca composite film was also analyzed through ft ir detection fig 2b as shown in the figure the characteristic peaks at 568 cm 1 and 598 cm 1 were caused by the tensile oscillation of feo and mno 32 33 the peaks at the center of 1030 cm 1 1216 cm 1 1370 cm 1 and 1730 cm 1 in the film belonged to the vibration of co c o c c ch3 and co bonds respectively 34 35 the characteristic peak at 902 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 came from the glucide and the hydroxyl vibrations of water molecules 36 37 the wider peak of the mno2 fe3o4 at 3440 cm 1 was due to the absorption of oh or h2o on the sample 37 fig 2c shows the raman characterization of the ca and mno2 fe3o4 ca film the peaks of ca at 653 5 cm 1 914 cm 1 1080 cm 1 1370 cm 1 1430 cm 1 1740 cm 1 and 2940 cm 1 were attributed to the bending vibration of cx hy the symmetric stretching oscillate of c o c the elastic vibrations of cc and co the flexural oscillation of h c c the bending oscillate of ch the elastic oscillation of co and the stretching oscillation of ch 21 it is also observed from fig 2c that the peak value of ca in the composite film decreased significantly while two obvious peaks at 643 cm 1 and 700 cm 1 related to the mno2 and the fe3o4 could be observed 38 39 the results further indicated that the mno2 and the fe3o4 had been loaded on the ca film successfully the elements valence in the composite films were studied through the xps the full range spectrum is displayed in fig 3a and from which the peaks of c o fe and mn elements were clearly visible the fe and mn oxides could also be observed fig 3b and fig 3c illustrate the mn 2p and fe 2p spectra respectively in fig 3b an intense peak with banding energy of 641 4 ev represented mn 2p3 2 while an intense peak with a banding energy of 653 08 ev represented mn 2p1 2 indicating that the mn contained in the composite film was tetravalent 40 41 in fig 3c the binding energies of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 were 709 78 ev and 723 88 ev which were same as the peak values of fe3o4 reported in the literature it indicated that the composite film contained fe2 feo and fe3 fe2o3 42 the analysis was consistent with those obtained by the xrd and raman analysis results 3 2 catalyst optimization synergistic catalysis of mno2 fe3o4 ca films the optimal proportion of fe3o4 and mno2 in the composite film as well as the best proportion of mno2 fe3o4 and ca were researched by comparison of the smx removal under different reaction conditions different catalyst dbd system the corresponding kinetic analysis g50 and sf results are listed in fig 4 fig s2 s4 fig 4a compares smx degradation under the conditions of different catalysts mno2 fe3o4 ca mno2 ca and fe3o4 ca addition in the dbd system the used composite films were the 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca and the loading capacity of fe3o4 and mno2 for the fe3o4 ca and mno2 ca film was the same as that of mno2 fe3o4 ca film results shown in fig 4a fig s2a fig s3a and fig s4a all proved that the mno2 fe3o4 ca films had the synergistic catalytic effect in the dbd plasma system the highest degradation percentage kinetic constants g50 and sf could be achieved in the coupling system of the mno2 fe3o4 ca films and dbd plasma the degradation percentage of smx after 60 min reaction in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system was increased by 8 98 and 13 32 compared with that in the fe3o4 ca dbd and the mno2 ca dbd system respectively in addition the little adsorption of the smx on the composite films proved the effect of active species for the smx oxidation results in fig 4b show that there was an optimal molar ratio of fe3o4 and mno2 for the maximum catalysis of the composite film and the higher smx removal could be obtained under the condition of the 3 1 of fe3o4 and mno2 for the impact of mass ratio of mno2 fe3o4 and ca of the film on the smx degradation it can be observed from fig 4c that with the increase of mno2 fe3o4 mass ratio the degradation of smx increased at first and then decreased when the mass ratio of mno2 fe3o4 was 3 the degradation percentage of smx was 17 66 higher than that obtained from the dbd alone system the same rule can also be seen in the kinetic analysis in which the k value of smx degradation calculated in the coupling system is 1 88 times that in the alone dbd plasma system for the results it could be due to the synergistic catalysis and the formation of the more active substances 43 44 as there were more active sites when the content of mno2 fe3o4 in the composite film increased it in turn promoted the decomposition of o3 and h2o2 to produce more ros 45 and then improve the smx degradation however the agglomeration caused by the sustaining increase of mno2 fe3o4 could lead to the reduction of the active site number and then impair the final degradation of the smx furthermore in fig s3 and fig s4 the energy efficiency 6 16 g kwh 1 and sf value 1 84 were also the highest when the added catalyst was 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca films according to the above results a brief summary could be concluded as the optimal parameter of the composite film addition was 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca film and it will be used in subsequent experiments the uv vis scanning of smx solution in both mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd and dbd system at different reaction periods were also recorded and the results within 200 400 nm are demonstrated in fig 5 from the figure it can be seen the height of the characteristic peak of smx decreased when the treatment time prolonged indicating that the smx was degrading moreover in the coupling system the characteristic peak value of smx solution declined more significantly confirming the synergistic action of the plasma and the composite film for the smx decomposition 3 3 stability testing for verifying the reusability and stability of the catalyst repeated experiments on the 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca film were carried out the film used after each experiment allowed to dry in air after a period of immersion in deionized water for the following cycle experiment the corresponding experimental and characterization results are exhibited in fig s5 s6 and s7 it can be seen from fig s5 the mno2 fe3o4 ca still had a catalytic effect in the fourth cycle experiment the morphology of the mno2 fe3o4 ca film did not change significantly before and after four cycle experiments fig s6 in addition the xrd pattern fig s7 of the composite film after the cycle test was basically consistent with that of the fresh sample indicating that the discharge did not have much effect on the crystallinity of the composite film the results verified the good reusability and stability of the mno2 fe3o4 ca films 3 4 influence of the initial ph fig 6 illustrates the influence of initial ph value 4 7 and 10 where 7 is the original ph of the solution on the degradation percentage kinetic constant and corresponding energy utilization of the smx solution in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd coupling system it can be seen from the figure that there were higher smx degradation in neutral and alkali solution condition when the solution ph was 4 0 04 7 0 1 10 0 02 the kinetic constants of smx degradation were 0 02027 min 1 0 04456 min 1 and 0 04804 min 1 the result was partially due to the self decomposition of o3 under the condition of higher solution ph 46 accordingly led to the more active species oh o2 and o3 etc production eqs 3 5 furthermore the presence of fe3o4 and mno2 catalyst could contribute to ozone decomposition and accordingly oh formation 47 eqs 6 11 48 49 therefore the increase of ph was beneficial to smx degradation 3 o 3 oh

mn 2 o 3 oh o 2 4 mno 2 3 5 cod and toc removal cod and toc removal in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd coupling system and the dbd alone system were analyzed and the results are displayed at fig 7 the cod removal increased from the 16 97 of the sole dbd system to the 46 84 of the coupling system fig 7a which proved the increased biodegradability of the initial smx solution however fig 7b shows that there was 7 24 increase of the toc removal in mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system after 60 min reaction which indicated that there were amounts of intermediates formation during the smx degradation 3 6 mechanism exploration 3 6 1 change of the solution physical properties as shown in fig 8a as the reaction time increased the ph value of the smx solution gradually declined and the decreasing trend was more obvious in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system the formation of acidic compounds during degradation resulted in the change of solution ph 21 the lower ph value in the coupling system inferred the more acidic substances generation in fig 8b there was an opposite changing trend of the solution conductivity which indicated the more inorganic ions production in the collaborative system 3 6 2 change of h2o2 and o3 concentration fig 9 subscribes the change of h2o2 and o3 concentration in both dbd and mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd systems and deionized water as the response solution it shows that the h2o2 and o3 content in the reaction system tended to increase with the prolonged reaction time indicating the accumulation of h2o2 and o3 during the reaction there was lower h2o2 concentrations under different timing in mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system fig 9a which might be caused by the consumption of h2o2 through the catalytic action of mno2 fe3o4 ca eqs 12 15 50 51 furthermore the o3 concentration also decreased in mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system fig 9b which was due to the o3 decomposition promoted by the composite films eqs 6 11 the changing rule of o3 concentration was different from our previous study in which the higher o3 concentration could be achieved in the mno2 ca dbd system and it was due to the promotion of mno2 for the o3 generation 21 however the content of mno2 used for the mno2 fe3o4 ca composite film preparation was less and the presence of fe3o4 could also promote the o3 decomposition and result in a higher o3 consumption rate than the generation rate 12 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 13 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 ho 2 h 14 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o 15 mno 2 h 2 o 2 2 h mn 2 2 h 2 o o 2 for verifying the catalytic ability of different composite films the effect of different composite films addition on the formed o3 in deionized water was investigated the obtained data in fig s8 show that different composite films addition all could cause the decrease of o3 concentration indicating the catalytic effect of the different composite film furthermore the changing trend of o3 at different experimental conditions was consistent with the change of smx removal achieved from the fig 4 that means there was lower o3 concentration under the condition of 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca composite films addition the result proved the higher utilization of the 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca composite film on the o3 3 6 3 effect of the scavenger addition ros have always been identified as the critical parameters on the pollutants oxidation in the ntp systems the effect of main ros including oh o2 and 1o2 on smx degradation has been investigated using the scavengers addition experiments isopropanol furfuryl alcohol fa and p benzoquinone p bq were collectors for oh 1o2 and o2 respectively the difference of smx degradation and the corresponding k value before and after different scavengers addition in the coupling system were reviewed and the results are summarized in fig 10 as shown in the figure when there were 1 mmol l 1 isopropanol p bq and fa in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system the degradation rate of smx was restrained by 3 66 40 8 and 66 11 respectively in the meantime the k value of smx degradation declined by 17 62 69 88 and 87 93 respectively there was a higher inhibition of the smx degradation when 2 mmol l 1 scavengers were added into the synergetic system the results proved that the detected ros had an important role for the smx degradation it can also be concluded from the figure that the role of 1o2 was more significant which might be due to the following reactions eqs 4 16 17 49 52 16 o 3 mn 2 o 3 1 o 2 2 mno 2 17 o 2 oh 1 o 2 o h 3 6 4 esr analysis for oh and 1o2 the relative amount of oh and the 1o2 in dbd and mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd systems were also compared through the esr analysis dmpo and temp were used as trapping agent for the oh and the 1o2 detection respectively as could be observed in fig 11 signals of oh and 1o2 could be detected in the deionized water of both systems but the relative weak characteristic signals were obtained from the dbd system above result indicated that the generation of oh and 1o2 was relatively lower in the sole dbd system in turn higher characteristic peak values confirmed the promotion of mno2 fe3o4 ca films on the ros generation 3 6 5 degradation routes analysis the byproducts formed in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system were analyzed and identified by lc ms analysis the molecular formula and charge mass ratio of the nine intermediates are listed in table s1 according to the data and references four routes of smx degradation were speculated as shown in fig 12 route i p2 m z 274 was formed due to the smx oxidation followed by the production of p3 m z 216 under the action of ros 1o2 oh for the opening of isoxazole ring 53 route ii p4 m z 270 was formed as a result of the attack of oh on the isoxazole ring or the benzene ring of smx 54 p5 m z 258 was then produced by the action of the active radical on the methyl group of the pentagonal ring of p4 55 the process was demethylation route iii ros 1o2 and o2 etc could oxidize the amidogen group in smx to hydroxylamine group and the hydroxylamine derivative of p6 m z 270 was accordingly formed the hydroxylamine group was then attacked continuously by the active species 1o2 which led to the p6 m z 270 transformed to the nitroso derivative p7 m z 268 and the nitro derivative p8 m z 284 of smx 53 56 route iv p9 m z 174 p10 m z 99 were firstly generated due to sn fracture and p10 m z 99 was the most common product formed during the smx degradation the sulfa part of smx has a negative electrostatic potential so it is easily attacked by the electrophiles of 1o2 and oh which can lead to the sn bond breakage 57 when enough ros 1o2 o2 and oh etc existed in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system the small molecules in the system could be further decomposed and mineralized to co2 h2o and inorganic ions at the end 58 3 6 6 toxicity evaluation for evaluating the toxicity of the formed intermediates the test software was used to test developmental toxicity 59 and bioaccumulation factor 23 of the smx and all the detected intermediates during its degradation the analysis consequences are given in fig 13 in which individual data could not be presented as shown in fig 13 most byproducts showed lower developmental toxicity than the smx and the bioaccumulation factors of all intermediates were significantly reduced compared to the smx these results indicated the effectiveness of the coupling process of mno2 fe3o4 ca composite film and dbd plasma for reducing the toxicity of the smx solution 3 6 7 proposed mechanism the possible mechanism of smx degradation in the coupling mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system is summarized in fig 14 as shown in the figure main reactions leading to the smx oxidation could be triggered by the active substances formed from the three processes of dbd fenton reaction and catalytic ozonation firstly ros oh h2o2 and o3 could be produced in the dbd process and the physical effects uv light high energy electron etc could be formed simultaneously a certain degradation of smx could then be achieved by the combined physical and chemical processes secondly the catalytic ozonation induced by the mno2 could form the active substances including 1o2 and o2 which could improve the conversion rate of ozone thirdly the effective activation of h2o2 by fe2 in the fe3o4 and the capture of fe3 by o3 could increase the oh concentration in solution in addition o3 and o2 could accelerate the conversion between fe2 and fe3 thus accelerating the circulation between fe2 and fe3 of the fenton reaction 4 conclusions the mno2 fe3o4 ca films were prepared and applied in the dbd plasma system to improve the smx degradation in the study the synthesized mno2 fe3o4 was loaded onto ca film by heating blending the surface morphology crystal and chemical bond structure of mno2 fe3o4 ca composite films were characterized to verify the perfect synthesis of the composite film from the degradation experiments it was found that the smx degradation could be promoted by adding different composite films and the optimal degradation of smx was achieved under the condition of 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca films addition the smx had better degradation in the neutral and alkaline environment after four repeated tests the mno2 fe3o4 ca films still showed good catalytic ability the catalytic ozonation induced by the fe3o4 as well as the mno2 combined with the fenton reaction led by the fe3o4 could enhance the formation of ros in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system and accordingly the smx oxidation in sum the addition of mno2 fe3o4 ca composite films could improve the removal of smx in the dbd system the composite films had the advantages of green environmental protection and easy recycling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12503,in this study efficient degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx by coupling dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma and mno2 fe3o4 cellulose acetate mno2 fe3o4 ca film catalyst was investigated sem xrd ft ir and xps were carried out to confirm the successful preparation of the mno2 fe3o4 ca film the optimal constitution of mno2 fe3o4 and ca was evaluated according to the smx degradation under different conditions of the prepared films when 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca films were added into the dbd system the removal rate of smx could reach 93 55 experiments on the effect of the initial ph value of the solution indicated that the smx degradation was better under both neutral and alkaline solution conditions mechanism analysis show that oh o2 and 1o2 were involved in the degradation of smx the mno2 fe3o4 ca catalyst could burst fenton reaction and promote ozone decomposition and accordingly generated more reactive oxygen species ros responsible for the increase of the smx degradation the cyclic experiments showed that film had good repeatability and stability four routes of smx degradation were given according to the byproducts analysis and the toxicity was evaluated graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sulfamethoxazole dielectric barrier discharge plasma mno2 fe3o4 ca catalysis reactive oxygen species data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sulfonamides have been widely used in the treatment of various human and animal diseases as one of sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole smx has strong antibacterial activity especially effective against staphylococcus and escherichia coli 1 due to the large consumption improper using and disposition smx has become a kind of common pollutant existed in water environments which accordingly lead to a potential threat to ecological conditions as well as human health 2 3 hence there is a need to develop more efficient methods to decompose smx emissions from various sources as a kind of advanced oxidation technology aot non thermal plasma ntp has shown enormous potential in environmental pollution remediation 4 6 among kinds of ntp dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma has multiple advantages including ease of operation stable discharge state high concentration ozone generation and effective treatment for the organic compounds etc therefore the dbd plasma technology has been applied in the sewage remediation extensively 7 8 in dbd process the high voltage applied to the electrode can ionize the gas present in the discharge channel and many kinds of physical and chemical effects are subsequently formed 9 such as the high energy electrons ultraviolet irradiation shock wave various reactive oxygen species ros e g o3 oh h2o2 and 1o2 etc etc the coexistence of physical and chemical effects has a joint action in the treatment of refractory compounds 10 nevertheless the relative lower oxidation potential of h2o2 and o3 formed during the dbd process has restricted the application of the dbd plasma technology in pollutant effluents treatment in recent years the collaborative processes of dbd plasma and different catalysts have been widely investigated to improve the efficiency of different dbd process for the wastewater treatment 11 12 due to the higher production of the ozone in dbd system catalytic ozonation material has been identified as one kind effective catalyst to enhance the oh formation and organic compounds degradation among the reviewed catalytic ozonation studies mno2 nanoparticles have the advantages of high performance environmental friendliness simple preparation and stable structure 13 16 however the problem of uneasy separation and recovery limits its practical application therefore research and development of the mno2 based recyclable catalyst and apply it into the dbd process is a meaningful subject for enhancing the utilization potentiality of the dbd plasma technology in wastewater treatment the porous polymer film prepared by cellulose acetate ca has shown good mechanical properties highly water permeability and good reusability nano particles can also mix with the ca to prepare the composite films and the loaded nano particles exhibit uniform dispersion and complete structure 17 18 moreover ca can also provide active sites for the catalyst growth researches have proved the effectiveness of the ca based films for the organic compounds degradation the ca ce zr cu0 film catalyst was successfully synthesized and applied for 4 nitrophenol methylene blue and rhodamine b reduction in water by khan et al 19 the mno2 ca composite film prepared by peng et al showed great removal performance for the dye 20 our former research has proved that the combination of dbd and mno2 ca could enhance the degradation of smx 21 however h2o2 formed in the reaction system still has not been fully utilized in the plasma catalytic ozonation synergistic process which can be considered as a breakthrough for further development of the dbd plasma based technologies as h2o2 is the main participant of fenton reaction and oh can also be formed in the reaction so the fenton process and catalytic ozonation process can be utilized together to further improve the degradation efficiency fe3o4 is a kind of heterogeneous fenton reagent furthermore it has been proved that the fe3o4 could promote the oh generation through catalytic ozonation process and fenton reaction in the pulsed discharge plasma system 22 therefore the combination of mno2 and fe3o4 was considered in the study to trigger the catalytic ozonation and the fenton reaction simultaneously in the dbd plasma system then promote the production of ros and the removal of pollutants based on the above analysis the combined system of mno2 fe3o4 ca films and dbd plasma were set up and applied to degrade smx wastewater in this study mno2 fe3o4 ca film was prepared by combing the mno2 fe3o4 powder and the ca and the catalytic performance of the mno2 fe3o4 ca was denoted by comparing the degradation effect of smx in the dbd plasma system in the presence and absence of the catalyst the surface morphology and crystal structure of the mno2 fe3o4 ca film were analyzed through various characterization the optimal preparation parameters of the composite film was reviewed the stability of the composite films was evaluated through reusability test the possible degradation routes of smx were speculated according to the detected byproducts the toxicity assessment of the smx solutions before and after treatment were carried out to prove the degradation process and the catalytic mechanism and smx degradation process was also analyzed and summarized 2 experimental 2 1 experimental materials all the drugs used in the experiment are given in text s1 and used directly without purification 2 2 catalyst preparation mno2 fe3o4 powder was manufactured using the hydrothermal method 23 first mixing 2 78 g feso4 7h2o and 1 5 g polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp to 100 ml deionized water and left at 90 c for 1 h then dissolving 0 8 g naoh in 100 ml water and adding into the above 90 c solution stirred till to form green suspension next adding different kmno4 solutions into the suspension to achieve the certain ratios of iron and manganese the molar ratios of fe and mn is 1 1 2 1 3 1 and 4 1 respectively the dark brown precipitates could then be formed after a slow agitation finally the resulting precipitates were centrifuged after aging for 12 h and washed multiple times with deionized water and ethanol then grounded after vacuum drying at 50 c the pure fe3o4 and mno2 powder were also prepared according to the above steps by adjusting elemental constituent the preparation method of mno2 fe3o4 ca composite film was consistent with the method recorded in our former study 21 the photographs of different composite films are provided in fig s1 2 3 characterization characterization methods of different materials are provided in text s2 2 4 experimental system and analytical method the dbd plasma device used in this study was same as our previous research 24 25 and the combination method of the dbd and the catalyst was also referred to our former research 21 in the experiment the output voltage was set as 6 kv and the load gas capacity was 0 5 l min 1 the initial concentration of smx solution was 50 mg l 1 and the solution volume was 500 ml without adjustment the initial solution of smx had the ph of about 7 the total time of a single experiment was 1 h and the sampling interval was 15 min during the treatment the residual smx was detected by high performance liquid chromatography hplc as detailed in text s3 change of the initial smx solution was regulated with naoh 0 1 mol l 1 and hcl 0 1 mol l 1 solutions the degradation kinetics analysis of the smx was calculated by pseudo first order formula the synergistic factor sf was computed based on the calculated kinetic constant of the smx degradation in different reaction systems 26 as shown below 1 sf k dbd f fe 3 o 4 mno 2 ca k dbd k f fe 3 o 4 mno 2 ca where k dbd is the kinetic constant of smx degradation in the sole dbd plasma system k f is the kinetic constant of smx removal in the sole films adsorption system k dbd f is the kinetic constant of smx degradation by synergistic effect of dbd plasma and different composite films energy efficiency g50 g kwh 1 during smx degradation is computed by the following formula 2 g 50 0 5 c 0 f c s v t 50 where c 0 is the initial concentration mg l 1 f is the output frequency of the power supply khz c is sampling capacitance μf s is the area of the lissajous figure v is the volume of smx solution l t 50 is the time reached 50 of smx removal h uv vis spectrophotometer was used to scan the smx solution in the initial and degradation process and the degradation was monitored by observing the characteristic peaks the concentrations of o3 and h2o2 in liquid phase were detected by a portable ozone tester cy 1a shanghai haiheng and titanium sulfate method respectively the cod value in the solution was measured by a water quality tester 5b 3a beijing lianhua the formed active substances 1o2 and oh was analyzed by the electron spin resonance esr the intermediates produced during smx degradation were determined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms in addition toxicity assessment of smx and the possible intermediates was assessed using toxicity estimation software tool test in the study three parallel experiments were conducted under all reaction conditions to assure the reliability of the data and the error bar pairs are shown in the figures 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of different catalysts the sem and eds diagrams of different nanoparticles nps and films are shown in fig 1 the results in fig 1a shows that the prepared fe3o4 nps uniformly dispersed and exhibited a magnetic flower like structure fig 1b indicates that the nanoflower mno2 fe3o4 composite nps can be prepared by the hydrothermal method and mno2 exhibited a layered petal structure 27 from the sem of mno2 fe3o4 ca composite film shown in fig 1c the mno2 fe3o4 nps with flower shaped structure existed in the composite films the eds diagram fig 1d shows that the prepared mno2 fe3o4 ca composite film consisted of several elements including c o fe and mn the detailed eds mapping illustrated in fig 1e i also shows that the composite film consists of fe mn c and o elements and they were distributed across over the film the results of sem analysis show that mno2 fe3o4 ca film was successfully synthesized the xrd patterns of fe3o4 nps mno2 fe3o4 nps and mno2 fe3o4 ca film are shown in fig 2a in the xrd pattern of fe3o4 the characteristic peaks at 30 2 35 5 43 2 53 6 57 3 62 7 correspond to 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 crystal planes of pure fe3o4 respectively jcpds card no 19 0629 28 29 according to the jcpds card no 80 1098 the peaks at 2θ 22 220 37 2 211 42 6 301 and 56 4 600 belonged to the mno2 30 the peak of ca appeared at 2θ 18 30 the characteristic peaks at 22 41 2 and 46 4 corresponded to the mno2 crystal planes of 220 420 and 321 respectively 31 to sum up the characteristic peaks of both mno2 and fe3o4 could be seen in the xrd spectrum of mno2 fe3o4 ca film which indicated the successful preparation of the composite film the detailed chemical constitution of the mno2 fe3o4 ca composite film was also analyzed through ft ir detection fig 2b as shown in the figure the characteristic peaks at 568 cm 1 and 598 cm 1 were caused by the tensile oscillation of feo and mno 32 33 the peaks at the center of 1030 cm 1 1216 cm 1 1370 cm 1 and 1730 cm 1 in the film belonged to the vibration of co c o c c ch3 and co bonds respectively 34 35 the characteristic peak at 902 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 came from the glucide and the hydroxyl vibrations of water molecules 36 37 the wider peak of the mno2 fe3o4 at 3440 cm 1 was due to the absorption of oh or h2o on the sample 37 fig 2c shows the raman characterization of the ca and mno2 fe3o4 ca film the peaks of ca at 653 5 cm 1 914 cm 1 1080 cm 1 1370 cm 1 1430 cm 1 1740 cm 1 and 2940 cm 1 were attributed to the bending vibration of cx hy the symmetric stretching oscillate of c o c the elastic vibrations of cc and co the flexural oscillation of h c c the bending oscillate of ch the elastic oscillation of co and the stretching oscillation of ch 21 it is also observed from fig 2c that the peak value of ca in the composite film decreased significantly while two obvious peaks at 643 cm 1 and 700 cm 1 related to the mno2 and the fe3o4 could be observed 38 39 the results further indicated that the mno2 and the fe3o4 had been loaded on the ca film successfully the elements valence in the composite films were studied through the xps the full range spectrum is displayed in fig 3a and from which the peaks of c o fe and mn elements were clearly visible the fe and mn oxides could also be observed fig 3b and fig 3c illustrate the mn 2p and fe 2p spectra respectively in fig 3b an intense peak with banding energy of 641 4 ev represented mn 2p3 2 while an intense peak with a banding energy of 653 08 ev represented mn 2p1 2 indicating that the mn contained in the composite film was tetravalent 40 41 in fig 3c the binding energies of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 were 709 78 ev and 723 88 ev which were same as the peak values of fe3o4 reported in the literature it indicated that the composite film contained fe2 feo and fe3 fe2o3 42 the analysis was consistent with those obtained by the xrd and raman analysis results 3 2 catalyst optimization synergistic catalysis of mno2 fe3o4 ca films the optimal proportion of fe3o4 and mno2 in the composite film as well as the best proportion of mno2 fe3o4 and ca were researched by comparison of the smx removal under different reaction conditions different catalyst dbd system the corresponding kinetic analysis g50 and sf results are listed in fig 4 fig s2 s4 fig 4a compares smx degradation under the conditions of different catalysts mno2 fe3o4 ca mno2 ca and fe3o4 ca addition in the dbd system the used composite films were the 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca and the loading capacity of fe3o4 and mno2 for the fe3o4 ca and mno2 ca film was the same as that of mno2 fe3o4 ca film results shown in fig 4a fig s2a fig s3a and fig s4a all proved that the mno2 fe3o4 ca films had the synergistic catalytic effect in the dbd plasma system the highest degradation percentage kinetic constants g50 and sf could be achieved in the coupling system of the mno2 fe3o4 ca films and dbd plasma the degradation percentage of smx after 60 min reaction in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system was increased by 8 98 and 13 32 compared with that in the fe3o4 ca dbd and the mno2 ca dbd system respectively in addition the little adsorption of the smx on the composite films proved the effect of active species for the smx oxidation results in fig 4b show that there was an optimal molar ratio of fe3o4 and mno2 for the maximum catalysis of the composite film and the higher smx removal could be obtained under the condition of the 3 1 of fe3o4 and mno2 for the impact of mass ratio of mno2 fe3o4 and ca of the film on the smx degradation it can be observed from fig 4c that with the increase of mno2 fe3o4 mass ratio the degradation of smx increased at first and then decreased when the mass ratio of mno2 fe3o4 was 3 the degradation percentage of smx was 17 66 higher than that obtained from the dbd alone system the same rule can also be seen in the kinetic analysis in which the k value of smx degradation calculated in the coupling system is 1 88 times that in the alone dbd plasma system for the results it could be due to the synergistic catalysis and the formation of the more active substances 43 44 as there were more active sites when the content of mno2 fe3o4 in the composite film increased it in turn promoted the decomposition of o3 and h2o2 to produce more ros 45 and then improve the smx degradation however the agglomeration caused by the sustaining increase of mno2 fe3o4 could lead to the reduction of the active site number and then impair the final degradation of the smx furthermore in fig s3 and fig s4 the energy efficiency 6 16 g kwh 1 and sf value 1 84 were also the highest when the added catalyst was 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca films according to the above results a brief summary could be concluded as the optimal parameter of the composite film addition was 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca film and it will be used in subsequent experiments the uv vis scanning of smx solution in both mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd and dbd system at different reaction periods were also recorded and the results within 200 400 nm are demonstrated in fig 5 from the figure it can be seen the height of the characteristic peak of smx decreased when the treatment time prolonged indicating that the smx was degrading moreover in the coupling system the characteristic peak value of smx solution declined more significantly confirming the synergistic action of the plasma and the composite film for the smx decomposition 3 3 stability testing for verifying the reusability and stability of the catalyst repeated experiments on the 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca film were carried out the film used after each experiment allowed to dry in air after a period of immersion in deionized water for the following cycle experiment the corresponding experimental and characterization results are exhibited in fig s5 s6 and s7 it can be seen from fig s5 the mno2 fe3o4 ca still had a catalytic effect in the fourth cycle experiment the morphology of the mno2 fe3o4 ca film did not change significantly before and after four cycle experiments fig s6 in addition the xrd pattern fig s7 of the composite film after the cycle test was basically consistent with that of the fresh sample indicating that the discharge did not have much effect on the crystallinity of the composite film the results verified the good reusability and stability of the mno2 fe3o4 ca films 3 4 influence of the initial ph fig 6 illustrates the influence of initial ph value 4 7 and 10 where 7 is the original ph of the solution on the degradation percentage kinetic constant and corresponding energy utilization of the smx solution in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd coupling system it can be seen from the figure that there were higher smx degradation in neutral and alkali solution condition when the solution ph was 4 0 04 7 0 1 10 0 02 the kinetic constants of smx degradation were 0 02027 min 1 0 04456 min 1 and 0 04804 min 1 the result was partially due to the self decomposition of o3 under the condition of higher solution ph 46 accordingly led to the more active species oh o2 and o3 etc production eqs 3 5 furthermore the presence of fe3o4 and mno2 catalyst could contribute to ozone decomposition and accordingly oh formation 47 eqs 6 11 48 49 therefore the increase of ph was beneficial to smx degradation 3 o 3 oh

removal increased from the 16 97 of the sole dbd system to the 46 84 of the coupling system fig 7a which proved the increased biodegradability of the initial smx solution however fig 7b shows that there was 7 24 increase of the toc removal in mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system after 60 min reaction which indicated that there were amounts of intermediates formation during the smx degradation 3 6 mechanism exploration 3 6 1 change of the solution physical properties as shown in fig 8a as the reaction time increased the ph value of the smx solution gradually declined and the decreasing trend was more obvious in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system the formation of acidic compounds during degradation resulted in the change of solution ph 21 the lower ph value in the coupling system inferred the more acidic substances generation in fig 8b there was an opposite changing trend of the solution conductivity which indicated the more inorganic ions production in the collaborative system 3 6 2 change of h2o2 and o3 concentration fig 9 subscribes the change of h2o2 and o3 concentration in both dbd and mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd systems and deionized water as the response solution it shows that the h2o2 and o3 content in the reaction system tended to increase with the prolonged reaction time indicating the accumulation of h2o2 and o3 during the reaction there was lower h2o2 concentrations under different timing in mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system fig 9a which might be caused by the consumption of h2o2 through the catalytic action of mno2 fe3o4 ca eqs 12 15 50 51 furthermore the o3 concentration also decreased in mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system fig 9b which was due to the o3 decomposition promoted by the composite films eqs 6 11 the changing rule of o3 concentration was different from our previous study in which the higher o3 concentration could be achieved in the mno2 ca dbd system and it was due to the promotion of mno2 for the o3 generation 21 however the content of mno2 used for the mno2 fe3o4 ca composite film preparation was less and the presence of fe3o4 could also promote the o3 decomposition and result in a higher o3 consumption rate than the generation rate 12 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 13

addition on the formed o3 in deionized water was investigated the obtained data in fig s8 show that different composite films addition all could cause the decrease of o3 concentration indicating the catalytic effect of the different composite film furthermore the changing trend of o3 at different experimental conditions was consistent with the change of smx removal achieved from the fig 4 that means there was lower o3 concentration under the condition of 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca composite films addition the result proved the higher utilization of the 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca composite film on the o3 3 6 3 effect of the scavenger addition ros have always been identified as the critical parameters on the pollutants oxidation in the ntp systems the effect of main ros including oh o2 and 1o2 on smx degradation has been investigated using the scavengers addition experiments isopropanol furfuryl alcohol fa and p benzoquinone p bq were collectors for oh 1o2 and o2 respectively the difference of smx degradation and the corresponding k value before and after different scavengers addition in the coupling system were reviewed and the results are summarized in fig 10 as shown in the figure when there were 1 mmol l 1 isopropanol p bq and fa in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system the degradation rate of smx was restrained by 3 66 40 8 and 66 11 respectively in the meantime the k value of smx degradation declined by 17 62 69 88 and 87 93 respectively there was a higher inhibition of the smx degradation when 2 mmol l 1 scavengers were added into the synergetic system the results proved that the detected ros had an important role for the smx degradation it can also be concluded from the figure that the role of 1o2 was more significant which might be due to the following reactions eqs 4 16 17 49 52 16 o 3 mn 2 o 3 1 o 2 2 mno 2 17 o 2 oh 1 o 2 o h 3 6 4 esr analysis for oh and 1o2 the relative amount of oh and the 1o2 in dbd and mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd systems were also compared through the esr analysis dmpo and temp were used as trapping agent for the oh and the 1o2 detection respectively as could be observed in fig 11 signals of oh and 1o2 could be detected in the deionized water of both systems but the relative weak characteristic signals were obtained from the dbd system above result indicated that the generation of oh and 1o2 was relatively lower in the sole dbd system in turn higher characteristic peak values confirmed the promotion of mno2 fe3o4 ca films on the ros generation 3 6 5 degradation routes analysis the byproducts formed in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system were analyzed and identified by lc ms analysis the molecular formula and charge mass ratio of the nine intermediates are listed in table s1 according to the data and references four routes of smx degradation were speculated as shown in fig 12 route i p2 m z 274 was formed due to the smx oxidation followed by the production of p3 m z 216 under the action of ros 1o2 oh for the opening of isoxazole ring 53 route ii p4 m z 270 was formed as a result of the attack of oh on the isoxazole ring or the benzene ring of smx 54 p5 m z 258 was then produced by the action of the active radical on the methyl group of the pentagonal ring of p4 55 the process was demethylation route iii ros 1o2 and o2 etc could oxidize the amidogen group in smx to hydroxylamine group and the hydroxylamine derivative of p6 m z 270 was accordingly formed the hydroxylamine group was then attacked continuously by the active species 1o2 which led to the p6 m z 270 transformed to the nitroso derivative p7 m z 268 and the nitro derivative p8 m z 284 of smx 53 56 route iv p9 m z 174 p10 m z 99 were firstly generated due to sn fracture and p10 m z 99 was the most common product formed during the smx degradation the sulfa part of smx has a negative electrostatic potential so it is easily attacked by the electrophiles of 1o2 and oh which can lead to the sn bond breakage 57 when enough ros 1o2 o2 and oh etc existed in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system the small molecules in the system could be further decomposed and mineralized to co2 h2o and inorganic ions at the end 58 3 6 6 toxicity evaluation for evaluating the toxicity of the formed intermediates the test software was used to test developmental toxicity 59 and bioaccumulation factor 23 of the smx and all the detected intermediates during its degradation the analysis consequences are given in fig 13 in which individual data could not be presented as shown in fig 13 most byproducts showed lower developmental toxicity than the smx and the bioaccumulation factors of all intermediates were significantly reduced compared to the smx these results indicated the effectiveness of the coupling process of mno2 fe3o4 ca composite film and dbd plasma for reducing the toxicity of the smx solution 3 6 7 proposed mechanism the possible mechanism of smx degradation in the coupling mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system is summarized in fig 14 as shown in the figure main reactions leading to the smx oxidation could be triggered by the active substances formed from the three processes of dbd fenton reaction and catalytic ozonation firstly ros oh h2o2 and o3 could be produced in the dbd process and the physical effects uv light high energy electron etc could be formed simultaneously a certain degradation of smx could then be achieved by the combined physical and chemical processes secondly the catalytic ozonation induced by the mno2 could form the active substances including 1o2 and o2 which could improve the conversion rate of ozone thirdly the effective activation of h2o2 by fe2 in the fe3o4 and the capture of fe3 by o3 could increase the oh concentration in solution in addition o3 and o2 could accelerate the conversion between fe2 and fe3 thus accelerating the circulation between fe2 and fe3 of the fenton reaction 4 conclusions the mno2 fe3o4 ca films were prepared and applied in the dbd plasma system to improve the smx degradation in the study the synthesized mno2 fe3o4 was loaded onto ca film by heating blending the surface morphology crystal and chemical bond structure of mno2 fe3o4 ca composite films were characterized to verify the perfect synthesis of the composite film from the degradation experiments it was found that the smx degradation could be promoted by adding different composite films and the optimal degradation of smx was achieved under the condition of 3 3 1 mno2 fe3o4 ca films addition the smx had better degradation in the neutral and alkaline environment after four repeated tests the mno2 fe3o4 ca films still showed good catalytic ability the catalytic ozonation induced by the fe3o4 as well as the mno2 combined with the fenton reaction led by the fe3o4 could enhance the formation of ros in the mno2 fe3o4 ca dbd system and accordingly the smx oxidation in sum the addition of mno2 fe3o4 ca composite films could improve the removal of smx in the dbd system the composite films had

12504,in this study the removal efficiencies of bio based rigid polyurethane foams rpufs group alcaligenes faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t strain group and the combined use of rpufs and a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t rpufs strain group were investigated the concentration of nacl number of rpufs initial ph and initial phenol concentration were sequentially examined the results showed the adsorption of phenol in rpufs group and rpufs strain group was improved with the increased number of rpufs and the highest adsorption was about 200 mg l when 40 pieces of rpufs were used under all conditions the phenol removal efficiency of rpufs strain group was higher than that of the strain group with the increased concentration of nacl the complete removal time of phenol in strain group and rpufs strain group was correspondingly prolonged in neutral and weakly alkaline conditions the phenol removal efficiency of strain group and rpufs strain group was much improved and the phenol removed time of 500 mg l of rpufs strain group was only 30 h at the ph of 7 with the increase of initial phenol concentration the complete removal time in strain group and rpufs strain group was delayed especially at the high concentration of 1100 mg l the strain group had nearly no ability to remove phenol while the rpufs strain group could still completely removed phenol at 78 h the phenol removal mechanism of the rpufs strain group was attributed to physical adsorption biodegradation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords phenol removal bio based rigid polyurethane foams alcaligenes faecalis physical adsorption biodegradation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction phenol is a toxic organic compound which exists in the wastewater of oil refining petrochemical pharmaceutical resin plastic paint paper and wood products etc 1 3 untreated phenolic wastewater causes a serious health risk to human animals and aquatic ecosystems 4 people exposed to phenol for a long time are prone to skin irritation gastrointestinal discomfort nausea vomiting diarrhea conjunctival burn headache blindness coma respiratory failure and death phenol interferes with metabolic enzymes of fish and affects their metabolism growth and reproduction the united states environmental protection agency stipulates that the concentration of phenol in treated industrial wastewater should not exceed 0 1 mg l and the world health organization who sets the concentration of phenol below 1 μg l as the standard for human drinking water 5 7 at present the main methods for removing phenol from wastewater include distillation physical adsorption liquid liquid extraction membrane extraction anodic oxidation photocatalytic oxidation pervaporation enzymatic oxidation biodegradation etc 6 however the above mentioned methods have some drawbacks such as long treatment cycle difficult operation low removal rate high cost secondary pollution and so on therefore people are trying to combine two or more methods together to reduce the secondary pollution shorten the treatment period and enhance the removal efficiency in the actual treatment of industrial wastewater biodegradation of phenol usually refers to the phenolic removal by microorganisms which has the advantages of low cost and no secondary pollution 8 so far there are many strains of bacteria used for phenol degradation such as rhizobium sp 9 rhodococcus sp 10 12 pseudomonas sp 13 14 micrococcus sp 15 bacillus sp 16 17 acinetobacter sp 18 20 ochrobactrum sp 21 alcaligenes sp 22 23 candida sp 24 26 trichosporon sp 27 meanwhile physical adsorption is a method to remove phenol from wastewater via intermolecular force between adsorption material and phenol such materials of physical adsorption have high porosity stable physical and chemical properties wide range of sources low cost and simple treatment mainly including calcium alginate beads 5 16 bamboo charcoal 28 high silica zeolite 29 red mud 30 31 and polyurethane foam 32 33 nowadays the combined use of physical adsorption and biodegradation has been attracting wide attention for the degradation efficiency of phenol by microorganisms is to be increased after physical adsorption reduces the concentration of phenol in wastewater in addition physical adsorption materials can also immobilize microorganisms resulting in improved degradation efficiency of phenol 5 23 ali et al 5 found that the synergistic use of calcium alginate beads and pseudomonas aeruginosa removed 900 mg l phenol from wastewater within 78 5 h wang et al 23 proposed a strategy for more efficient biodegradation of phenol by utilizing macroporous adsorption resin and a faecalis strain wy 01 on the other hand when old buildings are demolished rigid polyurethane foams rpufs used for insulation and flame retardancy are turned into construction waste however the dismantled rpufs should be recycled and reused in fact a few researchers used polyurethane foams pus to fix bacteria for removing phenol from water as early as 20 years ago branyik et al 32 explored the use of silica gel prepared by sol gel method and polyurethane foam as microbial carriers in the continuous degradation of phenol but they didn t study the effects of some important factors such as salt concentration initial ph and initial phenol concentration on phenol removal in recent years huang et al 34 reported that rpufs were modified and used to fix microorganisms to remove phenol from water however the modification process of rpufs is particularly complex costly and time consuming meanwhile the raw materials of pus were derived from petroleum which weren t beneficial for the environment and energy crisis therefore in this study bio based rpufs and a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t were chosen to study their synergistic removal of phenol from polluted water via a simple treatment the effects of concentration of nacl amount of rpufs initial ph value and initial phenol concentration on the removal of phenol were investigated and the removal mechanism was further proposed the result would also provide some initiative for the reuse of above mentioned rpufs from construction waste 2 experimental method 2 1 materials tryptone and yeast extract were purchased from shanghai naxi biotechnology co ltd shanghai china agar was

sterilized rpufs rpufs in strain and rpufs strain at the later stage of phenol degradation were dried in a vacuum drying oven samples were performed via a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir nicolet is50r thermo scientific company usa over the wavenumber range from 400 to 4000 cm 1 high resolution liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hr lc ms was used to obtain lc ms curves of strain

column temperature was 25 c the mass range was 50 300 m z according to hj 503 2009 determination of volatile phenols in water 4 amino antipyrine spectrophotometry the absorbance value of phenol

shanghai mapada instrument co ltd china with 600 nm wavelength 3 results and discussion 3 1 the compatibility between rpufs and a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t the compatibility between rpufs and a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was tested by observing the growth status of strains on the plate the digital photos of the corresponding plates were shown in fig 1 as seen in fig 1 bacteriostatic zones weren t found around rpufs and a large number of bacteria were found below rpufs indicating that rpufs had a good compatibility with a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t 3 2 the standard curve and regression equation of phenol concentration and absorbance five groups of phenol solutions with concentrations at 1 0 mg l 3 0 mg l 5 0 mg l 7 0 mg l and 9 0 mg l were prepared according to hj 503 2009 the absorbance values of phenol solutions with different concentrations were determined by an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer at 510 nm the standard curve and regression equation of phenol concentration and absorbance were obtained as shown in fig 2 3 3 effects of the concentration of nacl on phenol removal the application of alcaligenes sp for removing phenol from wastewater has been reported in literature thus we employed a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t in this study till now the maximum phenol concentration for most phenol degraded strains is at 1000 mg l 36 37 usually industrial wastewater containing phenol also contains various organic compounds and inorganic salts the excessive inorganic salt concentration mainly nacl concentration 3 leads to microbial inactivation and death so most microorganisms can treat industrial wastewater with the salt concentration below 3 thus in this study the phenol removed effects of nacl concentrations at 0 1 2 3 4 on rpufs group strain group and rpufs strain group were respectively investigated corresponding od600 values and phenol removal results were presented in fig 3 it can be seen that under the same nacl concentration the initial od600 of strain group was slightly higher than that of rpufs strain group due to the fact that some of bacteria attached to the surface of rpufs and didn t effectively increase od600 of the solution with the increase of nacl concentration the time of strain group and rpufs strain group entering the stable phase also increased and the od600 value under the stable phase was around 1 35 according to phenol removal results in fig 3 rpufs in each group reached adsorption equilibrium roughly at 12 h and the phenol adsorption capacity was about 120 mg l indicating that different nacl concentrations had nearly no effect on phenol adsorption for rpufs the removal time for phenol of strain group was about 36 h 36 h 54 h 72 h and 102 h under different nacl concentrations revealing that with the increase of nacl concentration the phenol removed efficiency of strain group was decreased to some extent under different nacl concentrations the removal time for phenol of rpufs strain group was about 30 h 30 h 48 h 60 h and 90 h respectively disclosing that compared to using a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t alone the synergic application of rpufs with a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t effectively shortened the removal time of phenol for after rpufs reduced the concentration of phenol in polluted water by absorption a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t increased cell activity and removal efficiency another possible reason is that rpufs immobilized part of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t cells seen fig 7 which improved the bacterial density and then enhanced the phenol removed efficiency form the polluted water the similar synergistic effect on removing harmful substances between physical adsorption materials and microorganisms also reported in the refs 23 28 33 for example ma et al 28 reported that the synchronous degradation efficiency of phenol was enhanced by encapsulating rhodococcussp strain pb 1 with sodium alginate sa bamboo charcoal bc chitosan acetate ca beads with further increase of nacl concentration the non degradation stage of phenol increased significantly displaying the increased nacl concentration inhibited the growth and propagation of the bacteria and thus hindered the biodegradation of phenol with time lasting the phenol removed efficiency of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was significantly higher than that of the earlier period the reason for this phenomenon could be due to that the density of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was exponentially increased with the prolonging of time and the cell activity was markedly enhanced after the bacteria gradually adapted to higher nacl concentrations in polluted water 3 4 effects of amount of rpufs on phenol removal to shorten the phenol removed time under high nacl concentrations the nacl concentration in polluted water was set as 4 effects of different rpufs amounts 0 10 pieces 20 pieces 30 pieces and 40 pieces on the phenol removal of rpufs group strain group and rpufs strain group were respectively investigated corresponding od600 values and phenol removal results were presented in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the time of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t in strain group and rpufs strain group almost simultaneously entered the stable phase and od600 of all a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t under the stable phase was around 1 35 from fig 4 with the increment of the amount of rpufs the adsorption capacity of phenol increased and the highest adsorption was about 200 mg l when 40 pieces of rpufs were used the adsorption capacity of phenol was positively correlated with the numbers of rpufs but it s not proportional to each other it is probably because the tight space of the conical flasks limited the phenol adsorption capacity of rpufs with the increase of rpufs number the phenol removed time of rpufs strain group was 102 h 90 h 78 h 78 h and 72 h respectively indicating that the increased number of rpufs in collaboration with a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t could effectively shorten the removal time of phenol 3 5 effects of initial ph on phenol removal the initial ph of the medium affects the growth reproduction and enzyme activity of microorganisms 38 according to gb 8978 88 and gb 18918 2002 ph value in wastewater discharged by urban sewage plants is between 6 and 9 based on the phenol removed results of different concentrations of nacl and different amount of rpufs the nacl concentration in polluted water was set as 1 and the number of rpufs was set as 20 pieces the phenol removed effects of different initial ph values 5 6 7 8 and 9 on rpufs group strain group and rpufs strain group were investigated respectively corresponding od600 values and phenol removal results were listed in fig 5 the od600 showed that a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t entering the stable phase needed a long time under acid or alkali conditions especially under acid conditions indicating that acid conditions or alkali conditions inhibited the bacterial growth however under different initial ph values od600 of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t entering the stable period were all around 1 35 as seen in fig 5 rpufs in each group reached adsorption equilibrium roughly at 12 h and the phenol adsorption capacity was about 140 mg l indicating that different initial ph values had little effect on the phenol adsorption of rpufs at different initial ph values strain group respectively removed phenol at 54 h 42 h 36 h 36 h and 48 h demonstrating that neutral and slightly alkaline conditions were favorable for the phenol removal and super acidic and per alkalic conditions inhibited the removal efficiency of phenol previous researchers reported the similar phenomenon 19 23 24 for example wang et al 23 reported that the removal efficiency of phenol increased from 0 51 to 44 91 2 25 when the ph increased from 4 to 6 reached the maximum of 99 34 3 97 at initial ph of 7 and then decreased with the increment of ph values at different initial ph values the phenol removed time of rpufs strain group was 42 h 36 h 30 h 30 h and 36 h respectively disclosing that under super acidic and per alkalic conditions the synergic use of rpufs and a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t effectively shorten the removal time of phenol the probable reason is due to it that rpufs absorption reduced the concentration of phenol in the polluted water resulting in the decrease of cytotoxicity of phenol to a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t another possible reason is attributable to rpufs fixing part of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t cells notably under the super acid conditions the initial hysteresis stage was much longer than that under the neutral and weakly alkaline conditions the phenol removed efficiency of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was markedly increased in the later period which was ascribed to that od600 was exponentially increased as time extended and the cells activity was enhanced with gradually adjusting to the polluted water ph values the phenol removed results of initial ph revealed that it was vital to maintain ph value in wastewater to neutral or weakly alkaline for achieving short removal time of phenol 3 6 effects of initial phenol concentrations on phenol removal as mentioned above phenol is toxic for the growth and reproduction of the strains and most strains degrade phenol with a maximal concentration 1000 mg l combined consideration of the results of phenol removal by nacl concentrations amount of rpufs and initial ph values the concentration of nacl was set as 1 the number of rpufs as 20 pieces and the initial ph value as 7 the phenol removed effects of initial phenol concentrations 300 mg l 500 mg l 700 mg l 900 mg l and 1100 mg l on rpufs group strain group and rpufs strain group were respectively investigated corresponding od600 values and phenol removal results were given in fig 6 with the increase of initial phenol concentration the time entering the stable phase of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was gradually extended indicating that high concentration of phenol severely retarded the growth and propagation of the strains the od600 of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t in the other groups maintained around 1 35 except for the pure strain group with the initial phenol concentration of 1100 mg l a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t in strain group with the initial phenol concentration of 1100 mg l slowly grew to an od600 of about 0 95 and then began to decrease slowly however a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t in rpufs strain group with the initial phenol concentration of 1100 mg l grew slowly they finally entered the stable od600 of about 1 35 the results showed that the adsorption of rpufs was beneficial to the growth and propagation of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t via reducing the phenol concentration by adsorption as seen from the phenol removal results in fig 6 the adsorption equilibrium of rpufs in each group was basically reached at roughly 12 h and with the increase of initial phenol concentrations the adsorption capacity of rpufs was slightly larger but basically maintained around 140 mg l with the increase of initial phenol concentrations the phenol removed time in rpufs strain group increased gradually which were 24 h 30 h 36 h 54 h and 78 h respectively under the initial phenol concentration of 300 mg l 500 mg l 700 mg l and 900 mg l the time required for complete phenol removal in strain group was 30 h 36 h 48 h and 72 h respectively under the initial phenol concentration of 1100 mg l the strain group didn t degrade phenol at all with the increase of initial phenol concentration the difference of completely phenol removed time between strain group and rpufs strain group gradually increased suggesting that the experimental scheme of rpufs strain has a significant effect on the phenol degradation at the initial high phenol concentrations 4 the mechanism of phenol removal ft ir spectra of the sterilized rpufs rpufs in rpufs group and rpufs strain group were presented in fig 7 as seen in fig 7 the absorption peaks of all rpufs at 3331 cm 1 2933 cm 1 2853 cm 1 1729 cm 1 and 969 cm 1 were found which were attributed to the stretching vibration of nh ch3 ch2 co and po respectively the absorption peak at 1593 cm 1 was assigned to the bending vibration of nh 39 40 ft ir spectra of the sterilized rpufs and rpufs in rpufs group were basically consistent while ft ir spectrum of rpufs strain group decreased slightly which may be caused by strains densely attached to the surface of rpufs meanwhile it was found that the stretching vibration peak intensity of co at 1729 cm 1 of rpufs in rpufs strain group was significantly lower which was possibly due to the covalent interaction between the carboxyl groups of amino acids in strains and the unsaturated double bonds of the carbamate groups of rpufs 34 the additional absorption peak at 1655 cm 1 was ascribed to the stretching vibration of co of the amide i bands in proteins of strains indicating that a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was immobilized by rpufs in rpufs strain group the microstructure of the sterilized rpufs rpufs in rpufs group and rpufs in rpufs strain group were observed via fsem and the corresponding images were shown in fig 8 from fig 8 compared with the sterilized rpufs the structure of rpufs in rpufs group and rpuf strain group was not changed significantly and silica aerogel sa particles were found in all rpufs compared with sterilized rpufs and rpufs in rpufs group the foam wall of rpufs strain group was attached with the intensive strains indicating rpufs had a better immobilization effect on a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t contrary to the free strains the immobilized intensive strains effectively improve the removal efficiency of phenol 22 after phenol was completely degraded in strain group cells in strain group were broken and then supernatant was taken for hr lc ms test the lc ms spectrogram and a possible pathway of phenol degradation by a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t were shown in fig 9 as seen from fig 9a four mass spectrum peaks were found at m z 111 01 143 02 161 04 and 119 03 m h the molecular weights were consistent with those of catechol 110 11 cis cis muconic acid 142 11 β ketoadienoic acid 160 13 and succinic acid 118 09 respectively according to the results of mass spectrometry a possible degradation pathway of phenol by a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was exhibited in fig 9b the possible degradation pathway was consistent with the phenol degradation pathway of a faecalis genbank no km977890 by wang et al 23 interestingly rpufs strain groups containing 3 nacl and 4 nacl which didn t completely remove phenol at 48 h exhibited red color via titrating 4 amino antipyrine and potassium ferricyanide and the samples in the conical flasks were yellow color however rpufs strain groups containing 0 nacl 1 nacl and 2 nacl which completely removed phenol were shown light yellow color via titrating 4 amino antipyrine and potassium ferricyanide and the samples in the conical flasks showed brown color see fig 10 this is probably because part of catechol produced in the process of phenol degradation by a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was oxidized into 1 2 benzoquinone in the air according to the lc ms spectrum in fig 9 the mass spectrum peak of m z at 109 08 m h was consistent with the molecular weight of 1 2 benzoquinone 108 9 confirming its presence combined with the above experiment and test results in the phenol removal process of rpufs strain group phenol adsorption via rpufs mainly occurred at the beginning and with the growth and propagation of the strains it mainly turned into phenol desorption and biodegradation until phenol was completely removed thus the phenol removal principle of rpufs strain group was proposed in scheme 1 5 conclusions castor oil based rpufs and a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t were used as an efficient physical adsorption biodegradation system for phenol in polluted water under different concentrations of nacl amount of rpufs initial ph and initial phenol concentrations the phenol removal efficiency of rpufs strain group was the highest one among the three groups with the increase of nacl and phenol concentrations the complete removal time of phenol in strain group and rpufs strain group was prolonged under neutral and weakly alkaline conditions the phenol removal efficiency of strain group and rpufs strain group was faster as the amount of rpufs increased the phenol adsorption capacity of rpufs in rpufs group and rpufs strain group was partially improved the study provides a strategy for construction of physical adsorption biodegradation system to remove phenol from wastewater and also lends a useful reference for

12504,in this study the removal efficiencies of bio based rigid polyurethane foams rpufs group alcaligenes faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t strain group and the combined use of rpufs and a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t rpufs strain group were investigated the concentration of nacl number of rpufs initial ph and initial phenol concentration were sequentially examined the results showed the adsorption of phenol in rpufs group and rpufs strain group was improved with the increased number of rpufs and the highest adsorption was about 200 mg l when 40 pieces of rpufs were used under all conditions the phenol removal efficiency of rpufs strain group was higher than that of the strain group with the increased concentration of nacl the complete removal time of phenol in strain group and rpufs strain group was correspondingly prolonged in neutral and weakly alkaline conditions the phenol removal efficiency of strain group and rpufs strain group was much improved and the phenol removed time of 500 mg l of rpufs strain group was only 30 h at the ph of 7 with the increase of initial phenol concentration the complete removal time in strain group and rpufs strain group was delayed especially at the high concentration of 1100 mg l the strain group had nearly no ability to remove phenol while the rpufs strain group could still completely removed phenol at 78 h the phenol removal mechanism of the rpufs strain group was attributed to physical adsorption biodegradation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords phenol removal bio based rigid polyurethane foams alcaligenes faecalis physical adsorption biodegradation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction phenol is a toxic organic compound which exists in the wastewater of oil refining petrochemical pharmaceutical resin plastic paint paper and wood products etc 1 3 untreated phenolic wastewater causes a serious health risk to human animals and aquatic ecosystems 4 people exposed to phenol for a long time are prone to skin irritation gastrointestinal discomfort nausea vomiting diarrhea conjunctival burn headache blindness coma respiratory failure and death phenol interferes with metabolic enzymes of fish and affects their metabolism growth and reproduction the united states environmental protection agency stipulates that the concentration of phenol in treated industrial wastewater should not exceed 0 1 mg l and the world health organization who sets the concentration of phenol below 1 μg l as the standard for human drinking water 5 7 at present the main methods for removing phenol from wastewater include distillation physical adsorption liquid liquid extraction membrane extraction anodic oxidation photocatalytic oxidation pervaporation enzymatic oxidation biodegradation etc 6 however the above mentioned methods have some drawbacks such as long treatment cycle difficult operation low removal rate high cost secondary pollution and so on therefore people are trying to combine two or more methods together to reduce the secondary pollution shorten the treatment period and enhance the removal efficiency in the actual treatment of industrial wastewater biodegradation of phenol usually refers to the phenolic removal by microorganisms which has the advantages of low cost and no secondary pollution 8 so far there are many strains of bacteria used for phenol degradation such as rhizobium sp 9 rhodococcus sp 10 12 pseudomonas sp 13 14 micrococcus sp 15 bacillus sp 16 17 acinetobacter sp 18 20 ochrobactrum sp 21 alcaligenes sp 22 23 candida sp 24 26 trichosporon sp 27 meanwhile physical adsorption is a method to remove phenol from wastewater via intermolecular force between adsorption material and phenol such materials of physical adsorption have high porosity stable physical and chemical properties wide range of sources low cost and simple treatment mainly including calcium alginate beads 5 16 bamboo charcoal 28 high silica zeolite 29 red mud 30 31 and polyurethane foam 32 33 nowadays the combined use of physical adsorption and biodegradation has been attracting wide attention for the degradation efficiency of phenol by microorganisms is to be increased after physical adsorption reduces the concentration of phenol in wastewater in addition physical adsorption materials can also immobilize microorganisms resulting in improved degradation efficiency of phenol 5 23 ali et al 5 found that the synergistic use of calcium alginate beads and pseudomonas aeruginosa removed 900 mg l phenol from wastewater within 78 5 h wang et al 23 proposed a strategy for more efficient biodegradation of phenol by utilizing macroporous adsorption resin and a faecalis strain wy 01 on the other hand when old buildings are demolished rigid polyurethane foams rpufs used for insulation and flame retardancy are turned into construction waste however the dismantled rpufs should be recycled and reused in fact a few researchers used polyurethane foams pus to fix bacteria for removing phenol from water as early as 20 years ago branyik et al 32 explored the use of silica gel prepared by sol gel method and polyurethane foam as microbial carriers in the continuous degradation of phenol but they didn t study the effects of some important factors such as salt concentration initial ph and initial phenol concentration on phenol removal in recent years huang et al 34 reported that rpufs were modified and used to fix microorganisms to remove phenol from water however the modification process of rpufs is particularly complex costly and time consuming meanwhile the raw materials of pus were derived from petroleum which weren t beneficial for the environment and energy crisis therefore in this study bio based rpufs and a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t were chosen to study their synergistic removal of phenol from polluted water via a simple treatment the effects of concentration of nacl amount of rpufs initial ph value and initial phenol concentration on the removal of phenol were investigated and the removal mechanism was further proposed the result would also provide some initiative for the reuse of above mentioned rpufs from construction waste 2 experimental method 2 1 materials tryptone and yeast extract were purchased from shanghai naxi biotechnology co ltd shanghai china agar was

observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope fsem nova nanosem 450 fei company netherlands each sample was sprayed with a thin layer of platinum before being examined via fsem the sterilized rpufs rpufs in strain and rpufs strain at the later stage of phenol degradation were dried in a vacuum drying oven samples were performed via a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir nicolet is50r thermo scientific company usa over the wavenumber range from 400 to 4000 cm 1 high resolution liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hr lc ms was used to obtain lc ms curves of strain

utilized to convert the absorbance value into the concentration of phenol the concentration of strain in phenol aqueous solution was determined by an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 1800pc shanghai mapada instrument co ltd china with 600 nm wavelength 3 results and discussion 3 1 the compatibility between rpufs and a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t the compatibility between rpufs and a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was tested by observing the growth status of strains on the plate the digital photos of the corresponding plates were shown in fig 1 as seen in fig 1 bacteriostatic zones weren t found around rpufs and a large number of bacteria were found below rpufs indicating that rpufs had a good compatibility with a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t 3 2 the standard curve and regression equation of phenol concentration and absorbance five groups of phenol solutions with concentrations at 1 0 mg l 3 0 mg l 5 0 mg l 7 0 mg l and 9 0 mg l were prepared according to hj 503 2009 the absorbance values of phenol solutions with different concentrations were determined by an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer at 510 nm the standard curve and regression equation of phenol concentration and absorbance were obtained as shown in fig 2 3 3 effects of the concentration of nacl on phenol removal the application of alcaligenes sp for removing phenol from wastewater has been reported in literature thus we employed a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t in this study till now the maximum phenol concentration for most phenol degraded strains is at 1000 mg l 36 37 usually industrial wastewater containing phenol also contains various organic compounds and inorganic salts the excessive inorganic salt concentration mainly nacl concentration 3 leads to microbial inactivation and death so most microorganisms can treat industrial wastewater with the salt concentration below 3 thus in this study the phenol removed effects of nacl concentrations at 0 1 2 3 4 on rpufs group strain group and rpufs strain group were respectively investigated corresponding od600 values and phenol removal results were presented in fig 3 it can be seen that under the same nacl concentration the initial od600 of strain group was slightly higher than that of rpufs strain group due to the fact that some of bacteria attached to the surface of rpufs and didn t effectively increase od600 of the solution with the increase of nacl concentration the time of strain group and rpufs strain group entering the stable phase also increased and the od600 value under the stable phase was around 1 35 according to phenol removal results in fig 3 rpufs in each group reached adsorption equilibrium roughly at 12 h and the phenol adsorption capacity was about 120 mg l indicating that different nacl concentrations had nearly no effect on phenol adsorption for rpufs the removal time for phenol of strain group was about 36 h 36 h 54 h 72 h and 102 h under different nacl concentrations revealing that with the increase of nacl concentration the phenol removed efficiency of strain group was decreased to some extent under different nacl concentrations the removal time for phenol of rpufs strain group was about 30 h 30 h 48 h 60 h and 90 h respectively disclosing that compared to using a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t alone the synergic application of rpufs with a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t effectively shortened the removal time of phenol for after rpufs reduced the concentration of phenol in polluted water by absorption a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t increased cell activity and removal efficiency another possible reason is that rpufs immobilized part of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t cells seen fig 7 which improved the bacterial density and then enhanced the phenol removed efficiency form the polluted water the similar synergistic effect on removing harmful substances between physical adsorption materials and microorganisms also reported in the refs 23 28 33 for example ma et al 28 reported that the synchronous degradation efficiency of phenol was enhanced by encapsulating rhodococcussp strain pb 1 with sodium alginate sa bamboo charcoal bc chitosan acetate ca beads with further increase of nacl concentration the non degradation stage of phenol increased significantly displaying the increased nacl concentration inhibited the growth and propagation of the bacteria and thus hindered the biodegradation of phenol with time lasting the phenol removed efficiency of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was significantly higher than that of the earlier period the reason for this phenomenon could be due to that the density of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was exponentially increased with the prolonging of time and the cell activity was markedly enhanced after the bacteria gradually adapted to higher nacl concentrations in polluted water 3 4 effects of amount of rpufs on phenol removal to shorten the phenol removed time under high nacl concentrations the nacl concentration in polluted water was set as 4 effects of different rpufs amounts 0 10 pieces 20 pieces 30 pieces and 40 pieces on the phenol removal of rpufs group strain group and rpufs strain group were respectively investigated corresponding od600 values and phenol removal results were presented in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the time of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t in strain group and rpufs strain group almost simultaneously entered the stable phase and od600 of all a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t under the stable phase was around 1 35 from fig 4 with the increment of the amount of rpufs the adsorption capacity of phenol increased and the highest adsorption was about 200 mg l when 40 pieces of rpufs were used the adsorption capacity of phenol was positively correlated with the numbers of rpufs but it s not proportional to each other it is probably because the tight space of the conical flasks limited the phenol adsorption capacity of rpufs with the increase of rpufs number the phenol removed time of rpufs strain group was 102 h 90 h 78 h 78 h and 72 h respectively indicating that the increased number of rpufs in collaboration with a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t could effectively shorten the removal time of phenol 3 5 effects of initial ph on phenol removal the initial ph of the medium affects the growth reproduction and enzyme activity of microorganisms 38 according to gb 8978 88 and gb 18918 2002 ph value in wastewater discharged by urban sewage plants is between 6 and 9 based on the phenol removed results of different concentrations of nacl and different amount of rpufs the nacl concentration in polluted water was set as 1 and the number of rpufs was set as 20 pieces the phenol removed effects of different initial ph values 5 6 7 8 and 9 on rpufs group strain group and rpufs strain group were investigated respectively corresponding od600 values and phenol removal results were listed in fig 5 the od600 showed that a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t entering the stable phase needed a long time under acid or alkali conditions especially under acid conditions indicating that acid conditions or alkali conditions inhibited the bacterial growth however under different initial ph values od600 of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t entering the stable period were all around 1 35 as seen in fig 5 rpufs in each group reached adsorption equilibrium roughly at 12 h and the phenol adsorption capacity was about 140 mg l indicating that different initial ph values had little effect on the phenol adsorption of rpufs at different initial ph values strain group respectively removed phenol at 54 h 42 h 36 h 36 h and 48 h demonstrating that neutral and slightly alkaline conditions were favorable for the phenol removal and super acidic and per alkalic conditions inhibited the removal efficiency of phenol previous researchers reported the similar phenomenon 19 23 24 for example wang et al 23 reported that the removal efficiency of phenol increased from 0 51 to 44 91 2 25 when the ph increased from 4 to 6 reached the maximum of 99 34 3 97 at initial ph of 7 and then decreased with the increment of ph values at different initial ph values the phenol removed time of rpufs strain group was 42 h 36 h 30 h 30 h and 36 h respectively disclosing that under super acidic and per alkalic conditions the synergic use of rpufs and a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t effectively shorten the removal time of phenol the probable reason is due to it that rpufs absorption reduced the concentration of phenol in the polluted water resulting in the decrease of cytotoxicity of phenol to a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t another possible reason is attributable to rpufs fixing part of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t cells notably under the super acid conditions the initial hysteresis stage was much longer than that under the neutral and weakly alkaline conditions the phenol removed efficiency of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was markedly increased in the later period which was ascribed to that od600 was exponentially increased as time extended and the cells activity was enhanced with gradually adjusting to the polluted water ph values the phenol removed results of initial ph revealed that it was vital to maintain ph value in wastewater to neutral or weakly alkaline for achieving short removal time of phenol 3 6 effects of initial phenol concentrations on phenol removal as mentioned above phenol is toxic for the growth and reproduction of the strains and most strains degrade phenol with a maximal concentration 1000 mg l combined consideration of the results of phenol removal by nacl concentrations amount of rpufs and initial ph values the concentration of nacl was set as 1 the number of rpufs as 20 pieces and the initial ph value as 7 the phenol removed effects of initial phenol concentrations 300 mg l 500 mg l 700 mg l 900 mg l and 1100 mg l on rpufs group strain group and rpufs strain group were respectively investigated corresponding od600 values and phenol removal results were given in fig 6 with the increase of initial phenol concentration the time entering the stable phase of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was gradually extended indicating that high concentration of phenol severely retarded the growth and propagation of the strains the od600 of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t in the other groups maintained around 1 35 except for the pure strain group with the initial phenol concentration of 1100 mg l a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t in strain group with the initial phenol concentration of 1100 mg l slowly grew to an od600 of about 0 95 and then began to decrease slowly however a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t in rpufs strain group with the initial phenol concentration of 1100 mg l grew slowly they finally entered the stable od600 of about 1 35 the results showed that the adsorption of rpufs was beneficial to the growth and propagation of a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t via reducing the phenol concentration by adsorption as seen from the phenol removal results in fig 6 the adsorption equilibrium of rpufs in each group was basically reached at roughly 12 h and with the increase of initial phenol concentrations the adsorption capacity of rpufs was slightly larger but basically maintained around 140 mg l with the increase of initial phenol concentrations the phenol removed time in rpufs strain group increased gradually which were 24 h 30 h 36 h 54 h and 78 h respectively under the initial phenol concentration of 300 mg l 500 mg l 700 mg l and 900 mg l the time required for complete phenol removal in strain group was 30 h 36 h 48 h and 72 h respectively under the initial phenol concentration of 1100 mg l the strain group didn t degrade phenol at all with the increase of initial phenol concentration the difference of completely phenol removed time between strain group and rpufs strain group gradually increased suggesting that the experimental scheme of rpufs strain has a significant effect on the phenol degradation at the initial high phenol concentrations 4 the mechanism of phenol removal ft ir spectra of the sterilized rpufs rpufs in rpufs group and rpufs strain group were presented in fig 7 as seen in fig 7 the absorption peaks of all rpufs at 3331 cm 1 2933 cm 1 2853 cm 1 1729 cm 1 and 969 cm 1 were found which were attributed to the stretching vibration of nh ch3 ch2 co and po respectively the absorption peak at 1593 cm 1 was assigned to the bending vibration of nh 39 40 ft ir spectra of the sterilized rpufs and rpufs in rpufs group were basically consistent while ft ir spectrum of rpufs strain group decreased slightly which may be caused by strains densely attached to the surface of rpufs meanwhile it was found that the stretching vibration peak intensity of co at 1729 cm 1 of rpufs in rpufs strain group was significantly lower which was possibly due to the covalent interaction between the carboxyl groups of amino acids in strains and the unsaturated double bonds of the carbamate groups of rpufs 34 the additional absorption peak at 1655 cm 1 was ascribed to the stretching vibration of co of the amide i bands in proteins of strains indicating that a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was immobilized by rpufs in rpufs strain group the microstructure of the sterilized rpufs rpufs in rpufs group and rpufs in rpufs strain group were observed via fsem and the corresponding images were shown in fig 8 from fig 8 compared with the sterilized rpufs the structure of rpufs in rpufs group and rpuf strain group was not changed significantly and silica aerogel sa particles were found in all rpufs compared with sterilized rpufs and rpufs in rpufs group the foam wall of rpufs strain group was attached with the intensive strains indicating rpufs had a better immobilization effect on a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t contrary to the free strains the immobilized intensive strains effectively improve the removal efficiency of phenol 22 after phenol was completely degraded in strain group cells in strain group were broken and then supernatant was taken for hr lc ms test the lc ms spectrogram and a possible pathway of phenol degradation by a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t were shown in fig 9 as seen from fig 9a four mass spectrum peaks were found at m z 111 01 143 02 161 04 and 119 03 m h the molecular weights were consistent with those of catechol 110 11 cis cis muconic acid 142 11 β ketoadienoic acid 160 13 and succinic acid 118 09 respectively according to the results of mass spectrometry a possible degradation pathway of phenol by a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was exhibited in fig 9b the possible degradation pathway was consistent with the phenol degradation pathway of a faecalis genbank no km977890 by wang et al 23 interestingly rpufs strain groups containing 3 nacl and 4 nacl which didn t completely remove phenol at 48 h exhibited red color via titrating 4 amino antipyrine and potassium ferricyanide and the samples in the conical flasks were yellow color however rpufs strain groups containing 0 nacl 1 nacl and 2 nacl which completely removed phenol were shown light yellow color via titrating 4 amino antipyrine and potassium ferricyanide and the samples in the conical flasks showed brown color see fig 10 this is probably because part of catechol produced in the process of phenol degradation by a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t was oxidized into 1 2 benzoquinone in the air according to the lc ms spectrum in fig 9 the mass spectrum peak of m z at 109 08 m h was consistent with the molecular weight of 1 2 benzoquinone 108 9 confirming its presence combined with the above experiment and test results in the phenol removal process of rpufs strain group phenol adsorption via rpufs mainly occurred at the beginning and with the growth and propagation of the strains it mainly turned into phenol desorption and biodegradation until phenol was completely removed thus the phenol removal principle of rpufs strain group was proposed in scheme 1 5 conclusions castor oil based rpufs and a faecalis subsp faecalis nbrc 13111t were used as an efficient physical adsorption biodegradation system for phenol in polluted water under different concentrations of nacl amount of rpufs initial ph and initial phenol concentrations the phenol removal efficiency of rpufs strain group was the highest one among the three groups with the increase of nacl and phenol concentrations the complete removal time of phenol in strain group and rpufs strain group was prolonged under neutral and weakly alkaline conditions the phenol removal efficiency of strain group and rpufs strain group was faster as the amount of rpufs increased the phenol adsorption capacity of rpufs in rpufs group and rpufs strain group was partially improved the study provides a strategy for construction of physical adsorption biodegradation system to remove phenol from wastewater and also lends a useful reference for the reuse of waste rpufs from old buildings credit authorship contribution statement guangxu bo conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology writing original draft
