9540,facing the high possibility of future severe water resources scarcity the haihe river basin in the north china plain is an important region for climate change studies this study employed an improved swat model with a management allowed depletion mad auto irrigation method to assess the impacts of future climate change on water cycle and crop growth of irrigated winter wheat and summer maize in the haihe river basin china a total of 27 global climate models gcms from the latest coupled model intercomparison project 6 cmip6 and two shared socioeconomic pathways ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 were used to drive the swat mad model to simulate crop growth and water balance components for two future periods of 2041 2070 2050s and 2071 2100 2080s data from almost all gcms showed an increase in annual mean maximum air temperature minimum air temperature total precipitation and solar radiation across the haihe river basin winter wheat yields increased by 15 6 ssp245 and 16 3 ssp585 by 2050s and by 17 1 ssp245 and 10 0 ssp585 by 2080s respectively summer maize yields increased by 8 9 ssp245 and 9 6 ssp585 by 2050s and by 12 6 ssp245 and 6 1 ssp585 by 2080s respectively the change of leaf area index lai indicated an advance in phenology of crops which might be related to the increase in temperature in the four future climate scenarios precipitation percolation and surface runoff increased by 19 16 57 25 mm 7 26 22 18 mm and 1 45 4 87 mm during winter wheat growing season 125 41 205 24 mm 51 03 96 37 mm and 33 97 68 69 mm during summer maize growing season however the irrigation amounts decreased by 18 82 83 74 mm and 35 71 50 92 mm during wheat and maize growing seasons respectively the annual net groundwater use ngu decreased with time and the crop water productivity cwp increased in the future which have positive effects on the sustainable development in this double cropping system with intensive irrigation management graphical abstract ga1 keywords swat mad cmip6 ssps water balance crop growth 1 introduction global climate change which is characterized by the global warming caused by the elevation of atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration has become one of the central issues in agriculture systems alexandrov and hoogenboom 2000 tilman et al 2011 ipcc et al 2014 light temperature and water are the basic and key factors to maintain crop development rosenzweig et al 2001 there is no doubt that all of the above changes have already and will continue to exert dramatic impacts on crop growth processes and agricultural water resources piao et al 2010 exploring the impact of climate change on watershed water resources and agricultural production and ensuring future food security is one of the most important tasks of the 21st century chen et al 2014 many studies predict that continued climate change will exacerbate the crisis of global food and water resources wheeler and von braun 2013 lesk et al 2016 pokhrel et al 2021 the haihe river basin is one of the areas of water shortage in china and even the world water resources per capita is only 198 6 m3 which is extremely short of water according to international standards since the 1980s the whole basin has entered the dry season and the impact of human activities on the underlying surface has resulted in an obvious decrease in surface water resources and total water resources zhang and li 2005 ren et al 2007 to solve the problem of water resource shortage in the haihe river basin underground water is exploited for decades zhang and li 2005 zheng et al 2010 approximately 80 of the total amount of groundwater exploitation in hebei is used for farmland irrigation and the long term and large scale groundwater exploitation has led to a decline in groundwater levels over the basin zhang and li 2005 the southern section of the haihe river basin is the region with the highest intensity of groundwater exploitation and utilization jia et al 2012 and the exploitation rate of shallow groundwater is as high as 133 ren et al 2007 the haihe plain accounts for 43 6 of the total area of the north china plain which is one of china s four major granaries the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system is the main planting mode in the north china plain producing approximately 30 and 70 of the country s total outputs respectively editorial committee of china agricultural yearbook 2011 more than 70 was used for agricultural irrigation among the groundwater that has been exploited which supported the area to conduct the winter wheat and summer maize rotation therefore it is of great significance to understand the impacts of future climate change on the irrigated crops and sustainability of groundwater resources in the haihe river basin for the formulation of future agricultural development plans and efficient management of water resources in the region climate change exacerbates the economic and social challenges already faced by water resources in agricultural areas rosenzweig et al 2004 iglesias et al 2011 in the study of climate impact on water resources the main research contents include the water balance agricultural irrigation reliability and resilience of the water supply system etc ipcc 1995 changes in precipitation air temperature and solar radiation caused by climate change as well as increases in atmospheric co2 concentrations affect crop water use and yield lobell and gourdji 2012 in recent years the method of combining agro ecosystem model with global climate models gcms has been widely used in the world to quantify the field level or regional climate change impacts for instance across australia wheat yields in rainfed fields were expected to decline in the future but yields were increased in cold areas due to warming temperatures ludwig and asseng 2006 wang et al 2018 in north america maize yields in rainfed fields were projected to decline under future climate change with increased atmospheric co2 concentrations jin et al 2017 in europe however the effect on maize yields could become positive because of the consequences of climate change parent et al 2018 thus due to the uncertainty of future climate there is considerable variation in the impacts on grain yields araya et al 2017 predicting and quantitatively assessing the response of crops to climate change can provide a basis for policy decisions and adaptation strategies wheeler et al 2013 the combination of gcms under different emission scenarios with hydrological crop models has become the most effective and important research method to quantitatively assess the impacts of climate change on watershed water resources and crop production rosenzweig et al 2014 challinor et al 2017 zaman et al 2016 in this study an improved soil and water assessment tool swat model with an enhanced representation of irrigation scheduling swat mad was used to simulate the effects of climate change on crop growth and water balance in the southern section of the haihe river basin the management allowed depletion mad auto irrigation option in swat has been fully evaluated in several studies chen et al 2019 marek et al 2020 swat can simultaneously consider the effects of meteorological factors and atmospheric co2 concentration changes on hydrological cycle and crop development gassman et al 2007 in the southern section of the haihe river basin there is a large variation for the spatio temporal distributions of precipitation and air temperature and the land use types and soil types are complex however the swat model can reflect the spatial changes of various elements in the basin through model inputs and adjust of parameters in addition at the large watershed scale agricultural management practices e g irrigation fertilization sowing date and harvest date are not the same due to the difference in meteorological conditions swat can also distinguish these differences by dividing the large area into subregions in terms of crop simulation like some widely used crop models crop parameters can also be calibrated in the swat model at the field experimental stations scale and extending the calibrated crop parameters to the hydrologic response units hrus contained the same crop thus the spatial representation of the whole region was obtained several swat studies provide useful insights regarding the effects of co2 concentration and climatic inputs changes jha et al 2004 faramarzi et al 2013 these studies mainly focus on the hydrological responses e g streamflow to climate change using cmip5 projections while the studies on the comprehensive responses of crop growth in a double cropping system and water resources in extreme shortage regions are relatively limited under the latest cmip6 projections therefore this study is a very timely and challenging work to explore the impact of future climate change on the highly managed southern section of the haihe river basin a well calibrated swat mad model was used in this study using statistically downscaled daily climate data from 27 gcms cmip6 the impact of projected future climate change on crop yield winter wheat and summer maize and water balance components in the southern section of the haihe river basin was assessed in this study the objectives of the study were to 1 investigate temporal and spatial changes of climate factors in the basin based on 27 gcms under two ssps 2 assess the impact of future climate change on crop phenology yield water balance components crop water productivity cwp and net groundwater use ngu and 3 explore how the projected climate change leads to the variations of crop yield and water use in the basin this study aims to provide the scientific basis for water resources management and agricultural sustainable development in this and similar region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area 112 10 16 e 117 47 47 e 36 16 24 n 40 5 15 n has a total basin area of 91 767 km2 fig 1 the study region features a semi arid semi humid continental monsoon climate with average annual precipitation of 475 565 mm 1998 2016 and average annual temperature of 7 8 15 1 1998 2016 approximately 70 80 of the precipitation falls from june to september the sunshine hours are approximately 2025 2673 h the region includes two major parts of mountain and plain which belong to the taihang mountains and the northern china plain respectively the northern china plain is one of the major grain production regions in china the main planting structure is a double cropping system of winter wheat summer maize and the planting area accounts for over 75 of the total crop planting area and over 90 of the total grain crop planting area water requirement for winter wheat summer maize growing period is approximately 870 mm supplemental irrigation is essential liu et al 2002 however as early as the late 1960s a significant reduction of surface runoff in the plain area resulted from the climate change and the interception of reservoirs in the mountains and by the 1990s most of rivers had dried up in the plain area zhang and li 2005 almost all of the irrigation water came from underground water chen and ma 2002 2 2 swat and swat mad the swat model is a physically based basin scale continuous time and semi distributed agro hydrological model that operates on a daily time step arnold et al 1998 primary components of model modules include a hydrological module crop growth module and non point source pollution module arnold et al 2012 the swat 2012 revision 664 for arcgis 10 3 platform arcswat2012 10 3 19 was used in this study the surface runoff is computed using a modified scs curve number method usda soil conservation service 1972 when the scs curve number method is used to calculate surface runoff the infiltration amount cannot be directly simulated and it is the net rainfall minus surface runoff neitsch et al 2011 the penman monteith method is used to calculate potential evapotranspiration in this study neitsch et al 2011 the actual evapotranspiration calculated by the model consists of two parts one is soil evaporation the other is vegetation transpiration percolation is calculated for each soil layer in the profile water is allowed to percolate if the water content exceeds the field capacity for that layer neitsch et al 2011 the plant growth component of swat is a simplified version of the epic environmental policy integrated climate model in which plant development is based on daily accumulated heat units neitsch et al 2011 the default management operations are scheduled by heat units and users can also schedule management practices according to the specific date winchell et al 2013 irrigation in hrus may be scheduled manually by users or automatically applied by swat neitsch et al 2011 however automatic irrigation operation in swat has some drawbacks and chen et al 2018 integrated the mad auto irrigation method into swat model which triggers irrigation according to a pre defined allowable depletion percentage of plant available water in swat mad users can set a single threshold to schedule irrigation during the crop growing season or multiple thresholds according to the sensitive periods of crop water stress chen et al 2018 mad based irrigation management uses the following expression 1 sol fc sol sw paw mad where sol fc is the one dimensional amount of water held in the soil profile at field capacity mm sol sw is the amount of water stored in soil profile on any given day mm paw is plant available water determined by both soil specific properties and plant specific maximum rooting depth mm and mad is the management allowed depletion percentage expressed as a decimal value ranging from 0 to 1 the cwp quantifies the crop production per unit of water used and is defined as the ratio of crop yield to crop evapotranspiration etc during crop growing season zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 which uses the following equation 2 cwp yield et c net groundwater use ngu ahmad 2002 can be used as a key index to evaluate groundwater storage profit and loss zhu et al 2009 it is the amount of groundwater extraction minus groundwater recharge which fully reflects the groundwater storage change under the influence of both natural and human activities ahmad 2002 the specific equation is as follows zhu et al 2009 3 ngu i tw q nr where ngu is net groundwater use mm i tw is the amount of groundwater extraction mm q nr is the amount of water percolating to groundwater mm a positive value of ngu indicates that groundwater storage is in a deficit state while a negative value indicates that groundwater has received certain recharge which plays a positive role in groundwater recovery in this study the simulated irrigation and percolation by the model are taken as the groundwater extraction amount and groundwater recharge amount respectively for the climate change study the water stress and temperature stress are two major stress factors limiting crop growth the water stress compares actual and potential crop transpiration neitsch et al 2011 the water stress value is computed using the following equation 4 wstrs 1 e t a c t e t 1 w a c t u a l u p e t where wstrs is the water stress for a given day expressed as a fraction of optimal crop growth 0 0 1 0 e t is the maximum crop transpiration on a given day mm e t act is the actual amount of transpiration on a given day mm and w actualup is the total crop water uptake for the day mm temperature stress is a function of daily average air temperature optimal and minimum temperatures for crop growth crop temperature stress increases as average temperature diverges from the optimal temperature crop temperature stress is determined using the following equations 5 tstrs 1 when av t min 6 tstrs 1 e 0 1054 t o p t a v 2 a v t m i n 2 when t min t av t opt 7 tstrs 1 e 0 1054 t o p t a v 2 2 t o p t a v t m i n 2 when t opt t av 2 t opt t min 8 tstrs 1 when av 2 t opt t min where tstrs is the temperature stress for a given day 0 0 1 0 av is the mean air temperature for a given day t min is the minimum or base temperature for crop growth and t opt is the optimal temperature for crop growth 2 3 swat model input data 2 3 1 raster data and weather data the basic data needed for setting up the swat model for a watershed are digital elevation model dem digital river network soil database land use and weather data srinivasan et al 2010 the swat model divides a watershed into multiple sub watersheds based on the basic data inputs which are then further subdivided into hrus according to the unique combinations of land use soil type and slope characteristics neitsch et al 2011 the data sources for establishing the swat model are shown in table 1 the study area was divided into 273 subbasins fig s3a according to the dem fig 1 digital river and geographic coordinates of seven hydrologic stations fig s2a furthermore 928 hrus fig s3b were divided based on soil type map fig s1a land use map fig s1b and slope characteristics weather data needed for swat include precipitation pcp minimum air temperature tmin maximum air temperature tmax relative humidity rhm wind speed wnd and solar radiation slr solar radiation is estimated by the angstorm formula allen et al 1998 based on sunshine hours ssd there are two sources of precipitation data one is the rain gauges fig s2b the other is trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42v7 precipitation data products had been verified in the southern section of the haihe river basin tan et al 2020 2 3 2 agricultural management practices winter wheat summer maize and spring maize were considered in this study area winter wheat summer maize double cropping system was in the plain area and the spring maize was in the xinzhou basin the land use type with agrr in swat was simplified as crop planting zones and winter wheat summer maize rotation zone in this study area was determined by the service center of national agricultural technology extension service center of national agricultural technology extension 2015 fig s4a in this study management operations planting irrigation fertilization and harvest were scheduled by the specific date seven planting harvesting zones fig s4b were divided according to the agricultural irrigation zone map of hebei province and seven agro meteorological stations information from agro meteorological stations contain specific dates of sowing harvesting and the beginning date of each growing stage of crops in the hru containing agrr the planting and harvesting dates were determined by the adjacent agro meteorological station irrigation scheduling was based on reports in the literature zhang et al 2005 liu et al 2016 kang et al 2018 technical specification for water saving irrigation ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 1998 collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 and water quota of hebei province bureau of quality and technical supervision of hebei province 2009 irrigation schedule zones were the same as planting harvesting zones the specific irrigation amount irrigation frequency and irrigation time for winter wheat and summer maize were shown in the supplementary material table s1 the irrigation quota for spring maize was 75 mm zhang et al 2018 specific irrigation schedule was shown in table s2 the irrigation amount for each irrigation zone varies with hydrological years 1998 2016 fig s6 and table s3 according to literature chen et al 1999 zhang and li 2005 han et al 2008 irrigation source zones were shown in fig s5a the amounts and time of n and p fertilizers assigned to crops were both determined according to the national agricultural technology extension service center 2009a 2009b 2009c and statistical yearbook or economic statistical yearbook of provinces containing in the study area fertilization schedule zones were shown in fig s5b 2 3 3 irrigation scheduling in the future climate scenarios only winter wheat and summer maize are considered in future climate scenarios in the study basin the mad threshold of crop initiation irrigation was determined by the trial and error method which was 0 4 for summer maize and 0 3 for winter wheat and the irrigation quota was 25 mm to compare with manual irrigation the specific sowing and harvesting dates under the mad auto irrigation method were the same as those of manual irrigation 19 crop rotation years were set up in manual irrigation while only one crop rotation year was needed using automatic irrigation the most frequent sowing harvest dates under manual irrigation were adopted when using the mad auto irrigation method the specific sowing harvest dates under the mad auto irrigation option were displayed in table s6 for winter wheat irrigation before the winter 75 mm was necessary under any type of hydrological year irrigation started from the jointing stage and the last irrigation was at the early stage of grain filling table s1 therefore for winter wheat irrigation before the winter was retained using the mad auto irrigation method and for summer maize irrigation started on the same date as sowing and stopped when the crop was harvested using swat mad using the swat mad model the specific dates for starting and ending irrigation were shown in table s7 2 4 calibration method and data the swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty procedures version 2012 abbaspour et al 2015 with the sequential uncertainty domain parameter fitting version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2007 was used for the parameter sensitivity analysis calibration and validation global sensitivity analysis was adopted in this study in total 19 parameters table s4 related to hydrology were selected in this study for sensitivity analysis based on prior knowledge of the study area and literature ren et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 abbaspour et al 2015 swat parameter calibration commonly starts with streamflow generally simulated streamflow by hydrological models is calibrated and validated at the watershed outlet shortcomings of such an approach include the evaluation of streamflow at only one geographic location without explicitly accounting for the variability of hydrological processes within a watershed qi and grunwald 2005 as a result monthly streamflow from 2010 to 2016 were used to calibrate the model parameters at zijingguan zhongtangmei fuping xiaojue quankou didu and pingshan in the mountain area of the study watershed the calibration and validation periods were 2010 2014 and 2015 2016 respectively the warm up period was 1998 2007 as most of the rivers in the plain area have changed from perennial rivers to seasonal or long term non flow rivers department of earth science of chinese academy of sciences 1990 zhang et al 2004 therefore monthly actual evapotranspiration eta estimated by sebs surface energy balance system from 2007 to 2016 were used to calibrate the parameters in the plain area the calibration period was 2007 2011 and the validation period was 2012 2016 the warm up period was 1998 2006 sebs estimated eta has been successfully evaluated and widely applied in this study area lin et al 2008 yang et al 2010 before parameter calibration using the eta estimated by sebs its accuracy was verified based on the monthly eta large lysimeter data of luancheng ecological experimental station the verification results showed that the eta estimated by sebs was in good agreement with the measured data by luancheng station r 2 coefficient of determination and nse nash sutcliffe efficiency values were 0 72 and 0 70 fig s7 therefore the eta estimated by sebs could be used as the observed values to calibrate the parameters of the swat model additionally crop growth parameters were calibrated against field scale measured data in this study crop growth parameters involved in the calibration in this study were listed in table s4 observed data used for crop development calibration included crop yield aboveground biomass and leaf area index lai which were collected from seven field experimental stations or counties the detailed crop information of seven field experimental stations or counties was provided in the supplementary material table s5 based on hebei province grain crop planting regionalization and the locations of seven experimental stations the study area was divided into seven zones and the calibrated crop parameters at each experimental station were extended to the corresponding zone namely crop parameters zones fig s4c nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 r 2 legates and mccabe 1999 percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and kge gupta et al 2009 were used to evaluate the streamflow and eta performance of the swat model in the southern section of the haihe river basin moreover mean bias error me willmott 1982 root mean square error rmse willmott 1982 and normalized root mean square error nrmse jamieson et al 1991 were also used as evaluation indicators for simulation accuracy of crop parameters generally the nse r 2 and kge values were closer to 1 indicating better agreement pbias value was closer to 0 denoting that the prediction results of the model are better nrmse value less than 10 indicating the model performance is very good 10 20 means good 20 30 indicating the model performance is normal and more than 30 means that the simulation effect is poor jamieson et al 1991 2 5 future climate data and scenarios global climate model is an important tool to understand the mechanisms between past climate and environment evolution and to predict potential global change scenarios in the future coupled model intercomparison project cmip which brings together gcms around the world aims to understand the variability and predictability of climate on the scale of decades or even centuries the newest cmip6 predictions consider the response of the climate system to both natural changes and human activities o neill et al 2016 climate change scenarios in cmip6 are a combination scenario which is a combination of forcing levels in representative concentration pathways rcps and shared socioeconomic pathways ssps o neill et al 2014 the cmip6 landscape 2019 predictions from multiple models can reduce the uncertainty of simulation results asseng et al 2019 faramarzi et al 2013 thomson et al 2005 the simulation results of a single gcm are difficult to convince the public integrating more circulation models would be better for dealing with the accurate projection problem crosbie et al 2011 xiao et al 2020 therefore 27 gcms were selected from different countries and regions table 2 which were provided by cmip6 https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 in this study daily weather data including air temperature precipitation solar radiation and relative humidity from 2035 to 2100 at 17 meteorological stations were generated using the statistical downscaling method liu and zuo 2012 additionally the future climate change scenarios of ssp2 4 5 ssp245 the radiative forcing of 4 5 w m 2 by 2100 and ssp5 8 5 ssp585 the radiative forcing of 8 5 w m 2 by 2100 were selected in this study to represent medium and high radiative forcing categories respectively o neill et al 2016 historical 1975 2010 weather data at 17 stations were collected from meteorological data center of china meteorological bureau http data cma cn in this study future climate projections from 27 gcms were obtained for two 36 year periods 2035 2070 and 2065 2100 the first five years of 2035 2039 and 2065 2069 served as the warm up periods the four future climate change scenarios simulated in this study were hereafter denoted as ssp245 2050s ssp245 2041 2070 ssp245 2080s ssp245 2071 2100 ssp585 2050s ssp585 2041 2070 and ssp585 2080s ssp585 2071 2100 3 results 3 1 swat calibration and validation global sensitivity analysis and the calibration values of model parameters were shown in the supplementary material figs s8 s9 tables s8 s10 the calibration results of the monthly streamflow at the seven discharge outlets indicated that the r 2 nse pbias and kge were 0 55 0 90 0 18 0 89 15 9 26 9 and 0 47 0 92 respectively during the calibration period table 3 during the validation period r 2 was 0 87 nse was 0 5 pbias was between 9 7 and 10 1 and kge was 0 87 in all stations except xiaojue station graphical comparison exhibited that the simulated streamflow of seven stations was consistent with the observed data fig s10 the r 2 pbias and kge for simulating eta were 0 70 0 82 0 76 13 52 and 0 67 0 87 respectively during the calibration period table 4 r 2 and kge values were 0 68 pbias values were within 4 20 17 73 during the validation period calibration results in seven field stations showed that the pbias values of lai aboveground biomass and yield for winter wheat were 6 2 14 3 and 2 8 respectively those values for summer maize were 1 2 6 0 and 0 4 table 5 nrmse values of lai aboveground biomass and yield for winter wheat were 24 4 20 5 and 21 6 respectively those values for summer maize were 11 0 31 3 and 16 2 validation results in seven field stations indicated that the pbias values of lai aboveground biomass and yield for winter wheat were 13 1 19 2 and 3 7 respectively those values for summer maize were 12 7 19 7 and 1 6 nrmse values of the three variables for winter wheat and summer maize were 35 0 20 2 17 9 and 25 8 24 7 20 1 the pbias values of spring maize yield during calibration and validation periods were 3 0 and 16 7 respectively it can be seen that the measured and simulated values fit well for lai aboveground biomass and yields of winter wheat and summer maize during both the calibration and validation periods figs s11 s12 to simulate the long term climate change scenarios auto irrigation scheduling is needed to automatically apply irrigation water in swat therefore the more physically based mad auto irrigation method was used to substitute the manual irrigation in this study the performance of swat mad in the southern section of the haihe river basin to simulate crop irrigation yield and etc during crop growing season were verified in this study fig s13 on the whole basin scale the pbias of swat mad simulated average annual irrigation amount yield and etc of winter wheat were 7 07 1 11 and 3 29 respectively fig s13a1 a3 for summer maize swat mad was performed well in simulating irrigation yield and etc every year from 2002 to 2016 but swat mad triggered a less irrigation amount compared to manual irrigation fig s13b1 however swat mad provided more irrigation in dry and extremely dry years indicating that it could respond well to drought in the entire basin the pbias values of swat mad simulated average annual summer maize yield and etc were 0 37 and 1 62 respectively fig s13b2 b3 these results denoted that the swat mad model was acceptable to be used for further scenario analysis 3 2 spatio temporal variations of future climate factors future climate change of the southern section of the haihe river basin was projected using two ssps ssp245 and ssp585 with 27 gcms the mean changes of air temperatures precipitation and solar radiation predicted by 27 gcm under four scenarios were increased spatially fig 2 in the plain area the mean maximum air temperature increased by 1 3 1 8 0 6 2 6 0 6 2 5 and 1 4 4 2 under scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s respectively fig 2a1 a4 the mean minimum air temperature increased by 1 3 1 9 0 7 2 9 0 7 2 9 and 1 4 5 5 under same scenarios the average annual precipitation increased by 17 2 35 8 and 4 5 42 5 in the 2050s and 3 40 3 and 19 0 61 7 in the 2080s under the ssp245 and ssp585 respectively fig 2c1 c4 the mean solar radiation varied from 3 7 5 3 and 0 7 4 9 in the 2050s and 2 5 9 5 and 0 3 5 6 in the 2080s under the ssp245 and ssp585 respectively fig 2d1 d4 during crop growing season almost all the gcm simulated an apparent increase in future air temperatures precipitation and solar radiation fig 3 during wheat growing season the 27 gcms predicted that average maximum air temperature minimum air temperature for scenarios ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s increased by 1 7 1 4 2 5 2 2 2 4 2 2 and 4 2 4 3 respectively fig 3a1 a2 the 27 gcms predicted average precipitation for scenarios ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s elevated by 15 4 23 8 20 2 and 45 5 during wheat growing season respectively fig 3a3 furthermore multiple gcms simulated that solar radiation during wheat growing season raised by 2 3 ssp245 and 1 8 ssp585 in the 2050s 5 8 ssp245 and 2 2 ssp585 in the 2080s fig 3a4 multiple gcms also predicted increases in air temperatures precipitation and solar radiation in the future during maize growing season in detail mean maximum air temperature minimum air temperature for scenarios ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s elevated by 1 5 2 1 2 1 2 9 2 0 3 0 and 3 4 5 1 respectively fig 3b1 b2 the precipitation would raise by 36 1 ssp245 and 42 4 ssp585 in the 2050s 39 3 ssp245 and 59 1 ssp585 in the 2080s fig 3b3 moreover the solar radiation would increase by 0 9 and 0 4 in the 2050s and 4 9 and 2 2 in the 2080s under the ssp245 and ssp585 respectively fig 3b4 3 3 change in future water balance components precipitation percolation and surface runoff were increased irrigation was decreased clearly during crop growing season under the future climate change scenarios in general etc decrease in the future figs 4 and 5 during wheat growing season precipitation percolation and surface runoff increased by 10 18 67 20 mm 5 68 27 76 mm and 0 35 7 45 mm respectively and the irrigation decreased by 5 50 106 38 mm fig 4a f the changing extent of etc was from 86 73 15 56 mm fig 4a f during the maize growing season all gcms predicted mean precipitation percolation and surface runoff increased by 102 58 232 03 mm 39 49 126 18 mm and 19 93 81 95 mm respectively the changes of irrigation and etc under four future climate change scenarios ranged from 71 47 to 28 98 mm and 28 70 17 07 mm respectively fig 5a f almost all gcms predicted that the irrigation during the crop growing season was decreased in this study fig 6a1 and b1 the mean irrigation during wheat growing season decreased by 17 63 mm 14 86 mm 23 75 mm and 76 21 mm respectively under scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s fig 6a1 also during the maize growing season the mean irrigation decreased by 31 45 mm 33 52 mm 36 85 mm and 45 83 mm fig 6b1 there were 15 8 21 and 27 gcms predicted that etc values were decreased during the wheat growing season under scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s respectively fig 6a2 however during the maize growing season there were 17 4 15 and 20 gcms simulated decline in etc fig 6b2 notably in the scenario of ssp585 2080s with the highest co2 concentration etc decreased apparently during the crop growing season the surface runoff and percolation increased by 1 45 4 87 mm and 7 26 22 18 mm respectively during the wheat growing season in the future climate scenarios fig 6a3 and a4 during the maize growing season increasing surface runoff and percolation were 33 97 68 69 mm and 51 03 96 37 mm respectively in the four future climate scenarios fig 6b3 and b4 in the plain area the changes of monthly water balance components predicted by 27 gcms showed that precipitation percolation and surface runoff increased most in july and august fig 7a d e under four future climate scenarios the precipitation percolation and surface runoff increased by 70 36 mm 21 23 mm and 16 17 mm respectively in july 72 55 mm 38 98 mm and 28 49 mm respectively in august the amount of irrigation decreased on the monthly scale with the largest decrease in april fig 7b in the scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp585 2050s and ssp245 2080s the irrigation amount decreased by approximately 20 00 mm and the most decline of 46 32 mm was found in the ssp585 2080s scenario in april eta decreased apparently in april may june and september and increased slightly in the others fig 7c eta decreased most in may with a mean value of 30 00 mm in the four future climate scenarios soil water content swc increased under almost all future scenarios fig 7f average monthly swc increased by 16 82 mm 16 54 mm 19 25 mm and 28 91 mm under scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s respectively 3 4 change of stress days and phenology in the future climate scenarios the number of temperature stress days decreased by 12 20 20 and 38 days in scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s respectively during the wheat growing season fig 8a1 under same scenarios the number of water stress days decreased by 14 17 19 and 32 days respectively during the wheat growing season fig 8a2 in addition the number of temperature stress days decreased the most from november to march fig 9a and the number of water stress days decreased the most from january to march fig 9b regarding summer maize the number of temperature stress days increased with the most increase of 8 days in scenario ssp585 2080s fig 8b1 while the number of water stress days decreased slightly fig 8b2 before the 210th day after sowing the lai of winter wheat was higher under future climate scenarios than that of the baseline period fig 10a also before the 55th day after sowing the lai of summer maize was higher under future climate scenarios than that of the baseline period fig 10b in future climate scenarios leaf senescence was earlier and faster than the baseline period 3 5 impacts of future climate change on crop yield and cwp overall future climate change had a positive impact on the crop yield fig 11a1 a2 the results showed that 27 gcms predicting the increase in winter wheat yields were 9 6 21 1 9 8 23 8 10 0 21 7 and 1 7 17 8 respectively under the future climate scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s with slight declines simulated by access esm1 5 1 7 and canesm5 1 7 under the ssp585 2080s scenario table 6 the change percentages of summer maize yields predicted by gcms were 0 4 18 1 0 3 12 6 3 5 19 0 and 12 8 25 6 under scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s respectively table 7 slight decreases in summer maize yields were predicted by canesm5 canesm5 canoe cmcc cm2 sr5 hadgem3 gc31 ll ipsl cm6a lr and miroc es2l table 7 spatially analysis showed that winter wheat yield of the study area increased in general under the future climate scenarios with a decrease only in the hengshui zone fig 12a1 a4 the increased extent of summer maize yield was smaller than winter wheat in the langfang zone the summer maize yield decreased under the future climate scenarios fig 12b1 b4 although the yields of winter wheat and summer maize increased under the future climate scenario the increased amplitude generally declined under the ssp585 2080s scenario in summary cwp increased in the future climate change scenarios fig 12b1 b2 all the gcms predicted a mean increase in winter wheat water productivity of 15 9 18 4 15 5 and 24 6 in scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp585 2050s ssp245 2080s and ssp585 2080s respectively fig 11b1 the increases in summer maize water productivity were predicted by most of the gcms the mean increase of summer maize water productivity was 8 7 and 9 0 in the 2050s and 2080s under ssp245 scenario 9 9 and 10 5 in the 2050s and 2080s under ssp585 scenario fig 11b2 3 6 alteration of ngu under future climate change scenarios the ngu was positive in both historical and future climate change scenarios during wheat growing season fig 13a1 a5 and the ngu value was the smallest under the ssp585 2080s scenario which was 65 227 mm hengshui zone had the largest ngu in both the historical period and the future climate scenarios the ngu during the maize growing season was opposite to that of winter wheat most of the ngu values were negative in the future climate scenarios fig 13b1 b5 for the annual ngu in the plain area the values were positive under the historical period ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s and ssp585 2050s and they were negative under some zones in the ssp585 2080s scenario fig 13c1 c5 in the four future climate scenarios the 27 gcms predicted the mean ngu decreased by 25 98 mm and 49 106 mm during wheat and maize growing seasons respectively fig 14a b compared to the historical period all 27 gcms predicted annual ngu decreases in future climate scenarios and the most apparent decrease was found in the ssp585 2080s scenario mean decreases of 124 mm 130 mm 148 mm and 264 mm were identified under scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s respectively fig 14c 4 discussion 4 1 responses of crops to future climate change in this study winter wheat and summer maize yields had a positive response to the future climate and the former was more sensitive fig 11a1 a2 it is widely accepted that elevating co2 concentration has a positive impact on crop physiological processes wang et al 2009 mcgrath and lobell 2013 asseng et al 2019 study showed that global wheat production would increase by 2 8 benefiting from elevated co2 the maize yield also increased with elevated co2 bassu et al 2014 but not as much as that of wheat mainly because c3 crops e g wheat were more sensitive to photosynthesis than c4 crops e g maize at high co2 levels kimball et al 2002 mcgrath and lobell 2013 this partially explained that winter wheat had a stronger yield promotion than summer maize in this study all 27 gcms showed an increase in air temperatures all over the study area in the future climate scenarios figs 2 and 3 winter wheat had the most direct response to the increase of air temperature which showed the number of temperature stress days decreased fig 8a1 and the obvious decreases were determined from november to march fig 9a winter wheat was vulnerable to freezing around winter period and future reductions in temperature stress days could indicate a decline in the frequency of these natural disasters a previous study showed that the wheat yields in cold regions would benefit from future warming wang et al 2018 so the increase in winter wheat yield in the future climate scenarios might be related to an increase in air temperatures in this study appropriate temperature has a promotion to crop development but extremely high temperatures such as heat stress accelerate leaf senescence and phenological stage development which may have a negative impact on crop growth cleland et al 2007 asseng et al 2015 in this study the dynamic change of daily lai under future climate change scenarios indicated that crop phenology was advanced which might be related to the increase in temperature fig 10 the benefits of elevated atmospheric co2 concentration on crop yields were likely to be offset by high temperatures bassu et al 2014 asseng et al 2019 especially high temperature at the anthesis stage would lead to decrease in quantity and quality of grain yield in wheat semenov 2009 maize yield decrease caused by high temperature stress was mainly related to the reduction of grain numbers particularly at the flowering stage heat stress reduced the number of florets exposed silk and grain numbers otegui and bonhomme 1998 edreira et al 2011 when the temperature in the silking stage was between 30 and 36 maize was subjected to heat stress which reduced the growth rate of plant and ear and then reduced the yield cicchino et al 2010 this further confirmed that under the ssp585 2080s scenario with the highest co2 concentration and the pronounced temperature rise the increased amplitude of the crop yields declined or even maize yield decreased in this study fig 11a1 a2 solar radiation is the main source of the earth s light and heat energy which has a profound impact on the growth of plants over the land surface yang et al 2013 some studies have found a close correlation between rice yield decrease and solar radiation reduction in the northeast china plain and the yangtze river basin chameides et al 1999 tao et al 2013 additionally changes in wheat and maize yields on the north china plain have also been linked to solar radiation chen et al 2009 xiao et al 2020 in the north china plain an increase of 1 mj m 2 in solar radiation resulted in an increased yield of 17 6 kg hm 2 for maize and 45 1 kg hm 2 for wheat xiao et al 2020 therefore the increase in crop yields might also be related to the increase in solar radiation under the future climate scenarios in this study 4 2 effects of future climate change on water balance components more than half of the gcms predicted a decrease in etc under scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s and ssp585 2050s and only in the ssp245 2080s scenario most of the gcms predicted an increase in etc fig 6a2 and b2 it is generally believed that elevation of co2 concentration reduces stomatal conductance or results in stomatal closure which leads to the decrease in transpiration rate cowan 1978 ainsworth and rogers 2007 in addition the etc change was also related to the increase of soil evaporation caused by future warming temperature and the increase of precipitation tao et al 2003 berg and sheffield 2019 studies on the north china plain have also confirmed that the increase of precipitation and co2 concentration in the future was significantly correlated with the change of etc which had a significant positive correlation with precipitation and a significant negative correlation with co2 concentration xiao et al 2020 a clear decrease in irrigation was shown for almost all gcms ssps time periods and zones within the southern section of the haihe river basin figs 4 6 which was the result of the decrease in etc combined with the increase of precipitation fig 3a3 and b3 furthermore the increases in percolation and surface runoff during the maize growing season were more than those in the wheat growing season fig 3 which might be related to the evident increase of precipitation from june to september fig 7a the increase of soil moisture was due to the increase of precipitation and the decrease in stomatal conductance resulting in a reduction of canopy water use hunsaker et al 2000 leakey 2009 the findings in this study were consistent with those of cmip5 and cmip6 which predicted that soil moisture would increase in the north china plain in the 21st century under global warming chen and yuan 2021 4 3 sustainability of agricultural irrigation in the future the simulation results in this study showed that the average annual ngu in the plain area reached approximately 300 mm in the historical period fig 13c1 the ngu was positive in both historical and future climate change scenarios during the wheat growing season fig 13a1 a5 under the same ssps the ngu during wheat growing season showed a trend of gradual decrease over time fig 13a2 a5 which indicated that future climate change was likely to have a positive impact on groundwater recovery in this study area in the historical period the ngu during the maize growing season was positive in most regions fig 13b1 indicating that groundwater storage was also decreasing but was not as much as that of the wheat growing season this was mainly because summer maize grew in the season with 80 annual precipitation however the ngu values in almost the entire plains were negative during the maize growing season under the four future climate scenarios the absolute values of ngu for summer maize increased over time under the same ssps fig 13b2 b5 which represented that the groundwater received a certain degree of recharge the annual ngu was positive in both historical period and future climate change scenarios except for the ssp585 2080s scenario fig 13c1 c4 indicating that groundwater in the plain area would still be in deficit in the future the annual ngu values in some zones were negative under the ssp585 2080s scenario fig 13c5 denoting that the percolation amount was greater than the irrigation amount compared with the historical period the ngu decreased from the 2050s to the 2080s in the same ssps fig 14c indicating that the decreasing groundwater storage in the plain was likely to slow down in the future 5 conclusions the changes of meteorological elements water balance components crop yield cwp and ngu were simulated based on 27 gcms from the latest cmip6 and well calibrated swat mad model the simulation results showed air temperatures and solar radiation increased under future climate scenarios especially the temperature increased most in the ssp585 2080s scenario and the solar radiation increased most in the ssp245 2080s scenario moreover precipitation surface runoff percolation and soil water content increased however irrigation decreased in the future overall etc decreased during crop growing seasons in the future climate change scenarios the crop yields of winter wheat and summer maize would increase in the future in the whole plain area winter wheat yield increased almost in all ssps gcms and time periods for summer maize almost all gcms predicted yield increased except for the ssp585 2080s scenario with the highest co2 concentration and air temperatures winter wheat yield increased by 10 0 17 1 in the 2050s and 2080s under ssp245 and ssp585 respectively 27 gcms predicted summer maize yield increased by 6 1 12 6 in the four future climate change scenarios therefore winter wheat yields respond more positively to future climate change although ngu decreased as irrigation decreased and percolation increased under the future climate scenarios groundwater storage remained at a deficit however ngu was negative during maize growing season indicating that the percolation was larger than irrigation and ngu values decreased during the wheat growing season over time to a certain extent groundwater overexploitation could be mitigated the results of future climate change and their implications for crop production in this study can provide decision making support for agricultural irrigation

9540,facing the high possibility of future severe water resources scarcity the haihe river basin in the north china plain is an important region for climate change studies this study employed an improved swat model with a management allowed depletion mad auto irrigation method to assess the impacts of future climate change on water cycle and crop growth of irrigated winter wheat and summer maize in the haihe river basin china a total of 27 global climate models gcms from the latest coupled model intercomparison project 6 cmip6 and two shared socioeconomic pathways ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 were used to drive the swat mad model to simulate crop growth and water balance components for two future periods of 2041 2070 2050s and 2071 2100 2080s data from almost all gcms showed an increase in annual mean maximum air temperature minimum air temperature total precipitation and solar radiation across the haihe river basin winter wheat yields increased by 15 6 ssp245 and 16 3 ssp585 by 2050s and by 17 1 ssp245 and 10 0 ssp585 by 2080s respectively summer maize yields increased by 8 9 ssp245 and 9 6 ssp585 by 2050s and by 12 6 ssp245 and 6 1 ssp585 by 2080s respectively the change of leaf area index lai indicated an advance in phenology of crops which might be related to the increase in temperature in the four future climate scenarios precipitation percolation and surface runoff increased by 19 16 57 25 mm 7 26 22 18 mm and 1 45 4 87 mm during winter wheat growing season 125 41 205 24 mm 51 03 96 37 mm and 33 97 68 69 mm during summer maize growing season however the irrigation amounts decreased by 18 82 83 74 mm and 35 71 50 92 mm during wheat and maize growing seasons respectively the annual net groundwater use ngu decreased with time and the crop water productivity cwp increased in the future which have positive effects on the sustainable development in this double cropping system with intensive irrigation management graphical abstract ga1 keywords

piao et al 2010 exploring the impact of climate change on watershed water resources and agricultural production and ensuring future food security is one of the most important tasks of the 21st century chen et al 2014 many studies predict that continued climate change will exacerbate the crisis of global food and water resources wheeler and von braun 2013 lesk et al 2016 pokhrel et al 2021 the haihe river basin is one of the areas of water shortage in china and even the world water resources per capita is only 198 6 m3 which is extremely short of water according to international standards since the 1980s the whole basin has entered the dry season and the impact of human activities on the underlying surface has resulted in an obvious decrease in surface water resources and total water resources zhang and li 2005 ren et al 2007 to solve the problem of water resource shortage in the haihe river basin underground water is exploited for decades zhang and li 2005 zheng et al 2010 approximately 80 of the total amount of groundwater exploitation in hebei is used for farmland irrigation and the long term and large scale groundwater exploitation has led to a decline in groundwater levels over the basin zhang and li 2005 the southern section of the haihe river basin is the region with the highest intensity of groundwater exploitation and utilization jia et al 2012 and the exploitation rate of shallow groundwater is as high as 133 ren et al 2007 the haihe plain accounts for 43 6 of the total area of the north china plain which is one of china s four major granaries the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system is the main planting mode in the north china plain producing approximately 30 and 70 of the country s total outputs respectively editorial committee of china agricultural yearbook 2011 more than 70 was used for agricultural irrigation among the groundwater that has been exploited which supported the area to conduct the winter wheat and summer maize rotation therefore it is of great significance to understand the impacts of future climate change on the irrigated crops and sustainability of groundwater resources in the haihe river basin for the formulation of future agricultural development plans and efficient management of water resources in the region climate change exacerbates the economic and social challenges already faced by water resources in agricultural areas rosenzweig et al 2004 iglesias et al 2011 in the study of climate impact on water resources the main research contents include the water balance agricultural irrigation reliability and resilience of the water supply system etc ipcc 1995 changes in precipitation air temperature and solar radiation caused by climate change as well as increases in atmospheric co2 concentrations affect crop water use and yield lobell and gourdji 2012 in recent years the method of combining agro ecosystem model with global climate models gcms has been widely used in the world to quantify the field level or regional climate change impacts for instance across australia wheat yields in rainfed fields were expected to decline in the future but yields were increased in cold areas due to warming temperatures ludwig and asseng 2006 wang et al 2018 in north america maize yields in rainfed fields were projected to decline under future climate change with increased atmospheric co2 concentrations jin et al 2017 in europe however the effect on maize yields could become positive because of the consequences of climate change parent et al 2018 thus due to the uncertainty of future climate there is considerable variation in the impacts on grain yields araya et al 2017 predicting and quantitatively assessing the response of crops to climate change can provide a basis for policy decisions and adaptation strategies wheeler et al 2013 the combination of gcms under different emission scenarios with hydrological crop models has become the most effective and important research method to quantitatively assess the impacts of climate change on watershed water resources and crop production rosenzweig et al 2014 challinor et al 2017 zaman et al 2016 in this study an improved soil and water assessment tool swat model with an enhanced representation of irrigation scheduling swat mad was used to simulate the effects of climate change on crop growth and water balance in the southern section of the haihe river basin the management allowed depletion mad auto irrigation option in swat has been fully evaluated in several studies chen et al 2019 marek et al 2020 swat can simultaneously consider the effects of meteorological factors and atmospheric co2 concentration changes on hydrological cycle and crop development gassman et al 2007 in the southern section of the haihe river basin there is a large variation for the spatio temporal distributions of precipitation and air temperature and the land use types and soil types are complex however the swat model can reflect the spatial changes of various elements in the basin through model inputs and adjust of parameters in addition at the large watershed scale agricultural management practices e g irrigation fertilization sowing date and harvest date are not the same due to the difference in meteorological conditions swat can also distinguish these differences by dividing the large area into subregions in terms of crop simulation like some widely used crop models crop parameters can also be calibrated in the swat model at the field experimental stations scale and extending the calibrated crop parameters to the hydrologic response units hrus contained the same crop thus the spatial representation of the whole region was obtained several swat studies provide useful insights regarding the effects of co2 concentration and climatic inputs changes jha et al 2004 faramarzi et al 2013 these studies mainly focus on the hydrological responses e g streamflow to climate change using cmip5 projections while the studies on the comprehensive responses of crop growth in a double cropping system and water resources in extreme shortage regions are relatively limited under the latest cmip6 projections therefore this study is a very timely and challenging work to explore the impact of future climate change on the highly managed southern section of the haihe river basin a well calibrated swat mad model was used in this study using statistically downscaled daily climate data from 27 gcms cmip6 the impact of projected future climate change on crop yield winter wheat and summer maize and water balance components in the southern section of the haihe river basin was assessed in this study the objectives of the study were to 1 investigate temporal and spatial changes of climate factors in the basin based on 27 gcms under two ssps 2 assess the impact of future climate change on crop phenology yield water balance components crop water productivity cwp and net groundwater use ngu and 3 explore how the projected climate change leads to the variations of crop yield and water use in the basin this study aims to provide the scientific basis for water resources management and agricultural sustainable development in this and similar region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area 112 10 16 e 117 47 47 e 36 16 24 n 40 5 15 n has a total basin area of 91 767 km2 fig 1 the study region features a semi arid semi humid continental monsoon climate with average annual precipitation of 475 565 mm 1998 2016 and average annual temperature of 7 8 15 1 1998 2016 approximately 70 80 of the precipitation falls from june to september the sunshine hours are approximately 2025 2673 h the region includes two major parts of mountain and plain which belong to the taihang mountains and the northern china plain respectively the northern china plain is one of the major grain production regions in china the main planting structure is a double cropping system of winter wheat summer maize and the planting area accounts for over 75 of the total crop planting area and over 90 of the total grain crop planting area water requirement for winter wheat summer maize growing period is approximately 870 mm supplemental irrigation is essential liu et al 2002 however as early as the late 1960s a significant reduction of surface runoff in the plain area resulted from the climate change and the interception of reservoirs in the mountains and by the 1990s most of rivers had dried up in the plain area zhang and li 2005 almost all of the irrigation water came from underground water chen and ma 2002 2 2 swat and swat mad the swat model is a physically based basin scale continuous time and semi distributed agro hydrological model that operates on a daily time step arnold et al 1998 primary components of model modules include a hydrological module crop growth module and non point source pollution module arnold et al 2012 the swat 2012 revision 664 for arcgis 10 3 platform arcswat2012 10 3 19 was used in this study the surface runoff is computed using a modified scs curve number method usda soil conservation service 1972 when the scs curve number method is used to calculate surface runoff the infiltration amount cannot be directly simulated and it is the net rainfall minus surface runoff neitsch et al 2011 the penman monteith method is used to calculate potential evapotranspiration in this study neitsch et al 2011 the actual evapotranspiration calculated by the model consists of two parts one is soil evaporation the other is vegetation transpiration percolation is calculated for each soil layer in the profile water is allowed to percolate if the water content exceeds the field capacity for that layer neitsch et al 2011 the plant growth component of swat is a simplified version of the epic environmental policy integrated climate model in which plant development is based on daily accumulated heat units neitsch et al 2011 the default management operations are scheduled by heat units and users can also schedule management practices according to the specific date winchell et al 2013 irrigation in hrus may be scheduled manually by users or automatically applied by swat neitsch et al 2011 however automatic irrigation operation in swat has some drawbacks and chen et al 2018 integrated the mad auto irrigation method into swat model which triggers irrigation according to a pre defined allowable depletion percentage of plant available water in swat mad users can set a single threshold to schedule irrigation during the crop growing season or multiple thresholds according to the sensitive periods of crop water stress chen et al 2018 mad based irrigation management uses the following expression 1 sol fc sol sw paw mad where sol fc is the one dimensional amount of water held in the soil profile at field capacity mm sol sw is the amount of water stored in soil profile on any given day mm paw is plant available water determined by both soil specific properties and plant specific maximum rooting depth mm and mad is the management allowed depletion percentage expressed as a decimal value ranging from 0 to 1 the cwp quantifies the crop production per unit of water used and is defined as the ratio of crop yield to crop evapotranspiration etc during crop growing season zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 which uses the following equation 2 cwp yield et c net groundwater use ngu ahmad 2002 can be used as a key index to evaluate groundwater storage profit and loss zhu et al 2009 it is the amount of groundwater extraction minus groundwater recharge which fully reflects the groundwater storage change under the influence of both natural and human activities ahmad 2002 the specific equation is as follows zhu et al 2009 3 ngu i tw q nr where ngu is net groundwater use mm i tw is the amount of groundwater extraction mm q nr is the amount of water percolating to groundwater mm a positive value of ngu indicates that groundwater storage is in a deficit state while a negative value indicates that groundwater has received certain recharge which plays a positive role in groundwater recovery in this study the simulated irrigation and percolation by the model are taken as the groundwater extraction amount and groundwater recharge amount respectively for the climate change study the water stress and temperature stress are two major stress factors limiting crop growth the water stress compares actual and potential crop transpiration neitsch et al 2011 the water stress value is computed using the following equation 4 wstrs 1 e t a c t e t 1 w a c t u a l u p e t where wstrs is the water stress for a given day expressed as a fraction of optimal crop growth 0 0 1 0 e t is the maximum crop transpiration on a given day mm e t act is the actual amount of transpiration on a given day mm and w actualup is the total crop water uptake for the day mm temperature stress is a function of daily average air temperature optimal and minimum temperatures for crop growth crop temperature stress increases as average temperature diverges from the optimal temperature crop temperature stress is

watershed are digital elevation model dem digital river network soil database land use and weather data srinivasan et al 2010 the swat model divides a watershed into multiple sub watersheds based on the basic data inputs which are then further subdivided into hrus according to the unique combinations of land use soil type and slope characteristics neitsch et al 2011 the data sources for establishing the swat model are shown in table 1 the study area was divided into 273 subbasins fig s3a according to the dem fig 1 digital river and geographic coordinates of seven hydrologic stations

southern section of the haihe river basin tan et al 2020 2 3 2 agricultural management practices winter wheat summer maize and spring maize were considered in this study area winter wheat summer maize double cropping system was in the plain area and the spring maize was in the xinzhou basin the land use type with agrr in swat was simplified as crop planting zones and winter wheat summer maize rotation zone in this study area was determined by the service center of national agricultural technology extension service center of national agricultural technology extension 2015 fig s4a in this study management operations planting irrigation fertilization and harvest were scheduled by the specific date seven planting harvesting zones fig s4b were divided according to the agricultural irrigation zone map of hebei province and seven agro meteorological stations information from agro meteorological stations contain specific dates of sowing harvesting and the beginning date of each growing stage of crops in the hru containing agrr the planting and harvesting dates were determined by the adjacent agro meteorological station irrigation scheduling was based on reports in the literature zhang et al 2005 liu et al 2016 kang et al 2018 technical specification for water saving irrigation ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 1998 collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 and water quota of hebei province bureau of quality and technical supervision of hebei province 2009 irrigation schedule zones were the same as planting harvesting zones the specific irrigation amount irrigation frequency and irrigation time for winter wheat and summer maize were shown in the supplementary material table s1 the irrigation quota for spring maize was 75 mm zhang et al 2018 specific irrigation schedule was shown in table s2 the irrigation amount for each irrigation zone varies with hydrological years 1998 2016 fig s6 and table s3 according to literature chen et al 1999 zhang and li 2005 han et al 2008 irrigation source zones were shown in fig s5a the amounts and time of n and p fertilizers assigned to crops were both determined according to the national agricultural technology extension service center 2009a 2009b 2009c and statistical yearbook or economic statistical yearbook of provinces containing in the study area fertilization schedule zones were shown in fig s5b 2 3 3 irrigation scheduling in the future climate scenarios only winter wheat and summer maize are considered in future climate scenarios in the study basin the mad threshold of crop initiation irrigation was determined by the trial and error method which was 0 4 for summer maize and 0 3 for winter wheat and the irrigation quota was 25 mm to compare with manual irrigation the specific sowing and harvesting dates under the mad auto irrigation method were the same as those of manual irrigation 19 crop rotation years were set up in manual irrigation while only one crop rotation year was needed using automatic irrigation the most frequent sowing harvest dates under manual irrigation were adopted when using the mad auto irrigation method the specific sowing harvest dates under the mad auto irrigation option were displayed in table s6 for winter wheat irrigation before the winter 75 mm was necessary under any type of hydrological year irrigation started from the jointing stage and the last irrigation was at the early stage of grain filling table s1 therefore for winter wheat irrigation before the winter was retained using the mad auto irrigation method and for summer maize irrigation started on the same date as sowing and stopped when the crop was harvested using swat mad using the swat mad model the specific dates for starting and ending irrigation were shown in table s7 2 4 calibration method and data the swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty procedures version 2012 abbaspour et al 2015 with the sequential uncertainty domain parameter fitting version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2007 was used for the parameter sensitivity analysis calibration and validation global sensitivity analysis was adopted in this study in total 19 parameters table s4 related to hydrology were selected in this study for sensitivity analysis based on prior knowledge of the study area and literature ren et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 abbaspour et al 2015 swat parameter calibration commonly starts with streamflow generally simulated streamflow by hydrological models is calibrated and validated at the watershed outlet shortcomings of such an approach include the evaluation of streamflow at only one geographic location without explicitly accounting for the variability of hydrological processes within a watershed qi and grunwald 2005 as a result monthly streamflow from 2010 to 2016 were used to calibrate the model parameters at zijingguan zhongtangmei fuping xiaojue quankou didu and pingshan in the mountain area of the study watershed the calibration and validation periods were 2010 2014 and 2015 2016 respectively the warm up period was 1998 2007 as most of the rivers in the plain area have changed from perennial rivers to seasonal or long term non flow rivers department of earth science of chinese academy of sciences 1990 zhang et al 2004 therefore monthly actual evapotranspiration eta estimated by sebs surface energy balance system from 2007 to 2016 were used to calibrate the parameters in the plain area the calibration period was 2007 2011 and the validation period was 2012 2016 the warm up period was 1998 2006 sebs estimated eta has been successfully evaluated and widely applied in this study area lin et al 2008 yang et al 2010 before parameter calibration using the eta estimated by sebs its accuracy was verified based on the monthly eta large lysimeter data of luancheng ecological experimental station the verification results showed that the eta estimated by sebs was in good agreement with the measured data by luancheng station r 2 coefficient of determination and nse nash sutcliffe efficiency values were 0 72 and 0 70 fig s7 therefore the eta estimated by sebs could be used as the observed values to calibrate the parameters of the swat model additionally crop growth parameters were calibrated against field scale measured data in this study crop growth parameters involved in the calibration in this study were listed in table s4 observed data used for crop development calibration included crop yield aboveground biomass and leaf area index lai which were collected from seven field experimental stations or counties the detailed crop information of seven field experimental stations or counties was provided in the supplementary material table s5 based on hebei province grain crop planting regionalization and the locations of seven experimental stations the study area was divided into seven zones and the calibrated crop parameters at each experimental station were extended to the corresponding zone namely crop parameters zones fig s4c nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 r 2 legates and mccabe 1999 percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and kge gupta et al 2009 were used to evaluate the streamflow and eta performance of the swat model in the southern section of the haihe river basin moreover mean bias error me willmott 1982 root mean square error rmse willmott 1982 and normalized root mean square error nrmse jamieson et al 1991 were also used as evaluation indicators for simulation accuracy of crop parameters generally the nse r 2 and kge values were closer to 1 indicating better agreement pbias value was closer to 0 denoting that the prediction results of the model are better nrmse value less than 10 indicating the model performance is very good 10 20 means good 20 30 indicating the model performance is normal and more than 30 means that the simulation effect is poor jamieson et al 1991 2 5 future climate data and scenarios global climate model is an important tool to understand the mechanisms between past climate and environment evolution and to predict potential global change scenarios in the future coupled model intercomparison project cmip which brings together gcms around the world aims to understand the variability and predictability of climate on the scale of decades or even centuries the newest cmip6 predictions consider the response of the climate system to both natural changes and human activities o neill et al 2016 climate change scenarios in cmip6 are a combination scenario which is a combination of forcing levels in representative concentration pathways rcps and shared socioeconomic pathways ssps o neill et al 2014 the cmip6 landscape 2019 predictions from multiple models can reduce the uncertainty of simulation results asseng et al 2019 faramarzi et al 2013 thomson et al 2005 the simulation results of a single gcm are difficult to convince the public integrating more circulation models would be better for dealing with the accurate projection problem crosbie et al 2011 xiao et al 2020 therefore 27 gcms were selected from different countries and regions table 2 which were provided by cmip6 https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 in this study daily weather data including air temperature precipitation solar radiation and relative humidity from 2035 to 2100 at 17 meteorological stations were generated using the statistical downscaling method liu and zuo 2012 additionally the future climate change scenarios of ssp2 4 5 ssp245 the radiative forcing of 4 5 w m 2 by 2100 and ssp5 8 5 ssp585 the radiative forcing of 8 5 w m 2 by 2100 were selected in this study to represent medium and high radiative forcing categories respectively o neill et al 2016 historical 1975 2010 weather data at 17 stations were collected from meteorological data center of china meteorological bureau http data cma cn in this study future climate projections from 27 gcms were obtained for two 36 year periods 2035 2070 and 2065 2100 the first five years of 2035 2039 and 2065 2069 served as the warm up periods the four future climate change scenarios simulated in this study were hereafter denoted as ssp245 2050s ssp245 2041 2070 ssp245 2080s ssp245 2071 2100 ssp585 2050s ssp585 2041 2070 and ssp585 2080s ssp585 2071 2100 3 results 3 1 swat calibration and validation global sensitivity analysis and the calibration values of model parameters were shown in the supplementary material figs s8 s9 tables s8 s10 the calibration results of the monthly streamflow at the seven discharge outlets indicated that the r 2 nse pbias and kge were 0 55 0 90 0 18 0 89 15 9 26 9 and 0 47 0 92 respectively during the calibration period table 3 during the validation period r 2 was 0 87 nse was 0 5 pbias was between 9 7 and 10 1 and kge was 0 87 in all stations except xiaojue station graphical comparison exhibited that the simulated streamflow of seven stations was consistent with the observed data fig s10 the r 2 pbias and kge for simulating eta were 0 70 0 82 0 76 13 52 and 0 67 0 87 respectively during the calibration period table 4 r 2 and kge values were 0 68 pbias values were within 4 20 17 73 during the validation period calibration results in seven field stations showed that the pbias values of lai aboveground biomass and yield for winter wheat were 6 2 14 3 and 2 8 respectively those values for summer maize were 1 2 6 0 and 0 4 table 5 nrmse values of lai aboveground biomass and yield for winter wheat were 24 4 20 5 and 21 6 respectively those values for summer maize were 11 0 31 3 and 16 2 validation results in seven field stations indicated that the pbias values of lai aboveground biomass and yield for winter wheat were 13 1 19 2 and 3 7 respectively those values for summer maize were 12 7 19 7 and 1 6 nrmse values of the three variables for winter wheat and summer maize were 35 0 20 2 17 9 and 25 8 24 7 20 1 the pbias values of spring maize yield during calibration and validation periods were 3 0 and 16 7 respectively it can be seen that the measured and simulated values fit well for lai aboveground biomass and yields of winter wheat and summer maize during both the calibration and validation periods figs s11 s12 to simulate the long term climate change scenarios auto irrigation scheduling is needed to automatically apply irrigation water in swat therefore the more physically based mad auto irrigation method was used to substitute the manual irrigation in this study the performance of swat mad in the southern section of the haihe river basin to simulate crop irrigation yield and etc during crop growing season were verified in this study fig s13 on the whole basin scale the pbias of swat mad simulated average annual irrigation amount yield and etc of winter wheat were 7 07 1 11 and 3 29 respectively fig s13a1 a3 for summer maize swat mad was performed well in simulating irrigation yield and etc every year from 2002 to 2016 but swat mad triggered a less irrigation amount compared to manual irrigation fig s13b1 however swat mad provided more irrigation in dry and extremely dry years indicating that it could respond well to drought in the entire basin the pbias values of swat mad simulated average annual summer maize yield and etc were 0 37 and 1 62 respectively fig s13b2 b3 these results denoted that the swat mad model was acceptable to be used for further scenario analysis 3 2 spatio temporal variations of future climate factors future climate change of the southern section of the haihe river basin was projected using two ssps ssp245 and ssp585 with 27 gcms the mean changes of air temperatures precipitation and solar radiation predicted by 27 gcm under four scenarios were increased spatially fig 2 in the plain area the mean maximum air temperature increased by 1 3 1 8 0 6 2 6 0 6 2 5 and 1 4 4 2 under scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585

in the 2080s under the ssp245 and ssp585 respectively fig 2d1 d4 during crop growing season almost all the gcm simulated an apparent increase in future air temperatures precipitation and solar radiation fig 3 during wheat growing season the 27 gcms predicted that average maximum air temperature minimum air temperature for scenarios ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s increased by 1 7 1 4 2 5 2 2 2 4 2 2 and 4 2 4 3 respectively fig 3a1 a2 the 27 gcms predicted average precipitation for scenarios ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s elevated by 15 4 23 8 20 2 and 45 5 during wheat growing season respectively fig 3a3 furthermore multiple gcms simulated that solar radiation during wheat growing season raised by 2 3 ssp245 and 1 8 ssp585 in the 2050s 5 8 ssp245 and 2 2 ssp585 in the 2080s fig 3a4 multiple gcms also predicted increases in air temperatures precipitation and solar radiation in the future during maize growing season in detail mean maximum air temperature minimum air temperature for scenarios ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s elevated by 1 5 2 1 2 1 2 9 2 0 3 0 and 3 4 5 1 respectively fig 3b1 b2 the precipitation would raise by 36 1 ssp245 and 42 4 ssp585 in the 2050s 39 3 ssp245 and 59 1 ssp585 in the 2080s fig 3b3 moreover the solar radiation would increase by 0 9 and 0 4 in the 2050s and 4 9 and 2 2 in the 2080s under the ssp245 and ssp585 respectively fig 3b4 3 3 change in future water balance components precipitation percolation and surface runoff were increased irrigation was decreased clearly during crop growing season under the future climate change scenarios in general etc decrease in the future figs 4 and 5 during wheat growing season precipitation percolation and surface runoff increased by 10 18 67 20 mm 5 68 27 76 mm and 0 35 7 45 mm respectively and the irrigation decreased by 5 50 106 38 mm fig 4a f the changing extent of etc was from 86 73 15 56 mm fig 4a f during the maize growing season all gcms predicted mean precipitation percolation and surface runoff increased by 102 58 232 03 mm 39 49 126 18 mm and 19 93 81 95 mm respectively the changes of irrigation and etc under four future climate change scenarios ranged from 71 47 to 28 98 mm and 28 70 17 07 mm respectively fig 5a f almost all gcms predicted that the irrigation during the crop growing season was decreased in this study fig 6a1 and b1 the mean irrigation during wheat growing season decreased by 17 63 mm 14 86 mm 23 75 mm and 76 21 mm respectively under scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s fig 6a1 also during the maize growing season the mean irrigation decreased by 31 45 mm 33 52 mm 36 85 mm and 45 83 mm fig 6b1 there were 15 8 21 and 27 gcms predicted that etc values were decreased during the wheat growing season under scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s respectively fig 6a2 however during the maize growing season there were 17 4 15 and 20 gcms simulated decline in etc fig 6b2 notably in the scenario of ssp585 2080s with the highest co2 concentration etc decreased apparently during the crop growing season the surface runoff and percolation increased by 1 45 4 87 mm and 7 26 22 18 mm respectively during the wheat growing season in the future climate scenarios fig 6a3 and a4 during the maize growing season increasing surface runoff and percolation were 33 97 68 69 mm and 51 03 96 37 mm respectively in the four future climate scenarios fig 6b3 and b4 in the plain area the changes of monthly water balance components predicted by 27 gcms showed that precipitation percolation and surface runoff increased most in july and august fig 7a d e under four future climate scenarios the precipitation percolation and surface runoff increased by 70 36 mm 21 23 mm and 16 17 mm respectively in july 72 55 mm 38 98 mm and 28 49 mm respectively in august the amount of irrigation decreased on the monthly scale with the largest decrease in april fig 7b in the scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp585 2050s and ssp245 2080s the irrigation amount decreased by approximately 20 00 mm and the most decline of 46 32 mm was found in the ssp585 2080s scenario in april eta decreased apparently in april may june and september and increased slightly in the others fig 7c eta decreased most in may with a mean value of 30 00 mm in the four future climate scenarios soil water content swc increased under almost all future scenarios fig 7f average monthly swc increased by 16 82 mm 16 54 mm 19 25 mm and 28 91 mm under scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s respectively 3 4 change of stress days and phenology in the future climate scenarios the number of temperature stress days decreased by 12 20 20 and 38 days in scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s respectively during the wheat growing season fig 8a1 under same scenarios the number of water stress days decreased by 14 17 19 and 32 days respectively during the wheat growing season fig 8a2 in addition the number of temperature stress days decreased the most from november to march fig 9a and the number of water stress days decreased the most from january to march fig 9b regarding summer maize the number of temperature stress days increased with the most increase of 8 days in scenario ssp585 2080s fig 8b1 while the number of water stress days decreased slightly fig 8b2 before the 210th day after sowing the lai of winter wheat was higher under future climate scenarios than that of the baseline period fig 10a also before the 55th day after sowing the lai of summer maize was higher under future climate scenarios than that of the baseline period fig 10b in future climate scenarios leaf senescence was earlier and faster than the baseline period 3 5 impacts of future climate change on crop yield and cwp overall future climate change had a positive impact on the crop yield fig 11a1 a2 the results showed that 27 gcms predicting the increase in winter wheat yields were 9 6 21 1 9 8 23 8 10 0 21 7 and 1 7 17 8 respectively under the future climate scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s with slight declines simulated by access esm1 5 1 7 and canesm5 1 7 under the ssp585 2080s scenario table 6 the change percentages of summer maize yields predicted by gcms were 0 4 18 1 0 3 12 6 3 5 19 0 and 12 8 25 6 under scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s respectively table 7 slight decreases in summer maize yields were predicted by canesm5 canesm5 canoe cmcc cm2 sr5 hadgem3 gc31 ll ipsl cm6a lr and miroc es2l table 7 spatially analysis showed that winter wheat yield of the study area increased in general under the future climate scenarios with a decrease only in the hengshui zone fig 12a1 a4 the increased extent of summer maize yield was smaller than winter wheat in the langfang zone the summer maize yield decreased under the future climate scenarios fig 12b1 b4 although the yields of winter wheat and summer maize increased under the future climate scenario the increased amplitude generally declined under the ssp585 2080s scenario in summary cwp increased in the future climate change scenarios fig 12b1 b2 all the gcms predicted a mean increase in winter wheat water productivity of 15 9 18 4 15 5 and 24 6 in scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp585 2050s ssp245 2080s and ssp585 2080s respectively fig 11b1 the increases in summer maize water productivity were predicted by most of the gcms the mean increase of summer maize water productivity was 8 7 and 9 0 in the 2050s and 2080s under ssp245 scenario 9 9 and 10 5 in the 2050s and 2080s under ssp585 scenario fig 11b2 3 6 alteration of ngu under future climate change scenarios the ngu was positive in both historical and future climate change scenarios during wheat growing season fig 13a1 a5 and the ngu value was the smallest under the ssp585 2080s scenario which was 65 227 mm hengshui zone had the largest ngu in both the historical period and the future climate scenarios the ngu during the maize growing season was opposite to that of winter wheat most of the ngu values were negative in the future climate scenarios fig 13b1 b5 for the annual ngu in the plain area the values were positive under the historical period ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s and ssp585 2050s and they were negative under some zones in the ssp585 2080s scenario fig 13c1 c5 in the four future climate scenarios the 27 gcms predicted the mean ngu decreased by 25 98 mm and 49 106 mm during wheat and maize growing seasons respectively fig 14a b compared to the historical period all 27 gcms predicted annual ngu decreases in future climate scenarios and the most apparent decrease was found in the ssp585 2080s scenario mean decreases of 124 mm 130 mm 148 mm and 264 mm were identified under scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s ssp585 2050s and ssp585 2080s respectively fig 14c 4 discussion 4 1 responses of crops to future climate change in this study winter wheat and summer maize yields had a positive response to the future climate and the former was more sensitive fig 11a1 a2 it is widely accepted that elevating co2 concentration has a positive impact on crop physiological processes wang et al 2009 mcgrath and lobell 2013 asseng et al 2019 study showed that global wheat production would increase by 2 8 benefiting from elevated co2 the maize yield also increased with elevated co2 bassu et al 2014 but not as much as that of wheat mainly because c3 crops e g wheat were more sensitive to photosynthesis than c4 crops e g maize at high co2 levels kimball et al 2002 mcgrath and lobell 2013 this partially explained that winter wheat had a stronger yield promotion than summer maize in this study all 27 gcms showed an increase in air temperatures all over the study area in the future climate scenarios figs 2 and 3 winter wheat had the most direct response to the increase of air temperature which showed the number of temperature stress days decreased fig 8a1 and the obvious decreases were determined from november to march fig 9a winter wheat was vulnerable to freezing around winter period and future reductions in temperature stress days could indicate a decline in the frequency of these natural disasters a previous study showed that the wheat yields in cold regions would benefit from future warming wang et al 2018 so the increase in winter wheat yield in the future climate scenarios might be related to an increase in air temperatures in this study appropriate temperature has a promotion to crop development but extremely high temperatures such as heat stress accelerate leaf senescence and phenological stage development which may have a negative impact on crop growth cleland et al 2007 asseng et al 2015 in this study the dynamic change of daily lai under future climate change scenarios indicated that crop phenology was advanced which might be related to the increase in temperature fig 10 the benefits of elevated atmospheric co2 concentration on crop yields were likely to be offset by high temperatures bassu et al 2014 asseng et al 2019 especially high temperature at the anthesis stage would lead to decrease in quantity and quality of grain yield in wheat semenov 2009 maize yield decrease caused by high temperature stress was mainly related to the reduction of grain numbers particularly at the flowering stage heat stress reduced the number of florets exposed silk and grain numbers otegui and bonhomme 1998 edreira et al 2011 when the temperature in the silking stage was between 30 and 36 maize was subjected to heat stress which reduced the growth rate of plant and ear and then reduced the yield cicchino et al 2010 this further confirmed that under the ssp585 2080s scenario with the highest co2 concentration and the pronounced temperature rise the increased amplitude of the crop yields declined or even maize yield decreased in this study fig 11a1 a2 solar radiation is the main source of the earth s light and heat energy which has a profound impact on the growth of plants over the land surface yang et al 2013 some studies have found a close correlation between rice yield decrease and solar radiation reduction in the northeast china plain and the yangtze river basin chameides et al 1999 tao et al 2013 additionally changes in wheat and maize yields on the north china plain have also been linked to solar radiation chen et al 2009 xiao et al 2020 in the north china plain an increase of 1 mj m 2 in solar radiation resulted in an increased yield of 17 6 kg hm 2 for maize and 45 1 kg hm 2 for wheat xiao et al 2020 therefore the increase in crop yields might also be related to the increase in solar radiation under the future climate scenarios in this study 4 2 effects of future climate change on water balance components more than half of the gcms predicted a decrease in etc under scenarios of ssp245 2050s ssp245 2080s and ssp585 2050s and only in the ssp245 2080s scenario most of the gcms predicted an increase in etc fig 6a2 and b2 it is generally believed that elevation of co2 concentration reduces stomatal conductance or results in stomatal closure which leads to the decrease in transpiration rate cowan 1978 ainsworth and rogers 2007 in addition the etc change was also related to the increase of soil evaporation caused by future warming temperature and the increase of precipitation tao et al 2003 berg and sheffield 2019 studies on the north china plain have also confirmed that the increase of precipitation and co2 concentration in the future was significantly correlated with the change of etc which had a significant positive correlation with precipitation and a significant negative correlation with co2 concentration xiao et al 2020 a clear decrease in irrigation was shown for almost all gcms ssps time periods and zones within the southern section of the haihe river basin figs 4 6 which was the result of the decrease in etc combined with the increase of precipitation fig 3a3 and b3 furthermore the increases in percolation and surface runoff during the maize growing season were more than those in the wheat growing season fig 3 which might be related to the evident increase of precipitation from june to september fig 7a the increase of soil moisture was due to the increase of precipitation and the decrease in stomatal conductance resulting in a reduction of canopy water use hunsaker et al 2000 leakey 2009 the findings in this study were consistent with those of cmip5 and cmip6 which predicted that soil moisture would increase in the north china plain in the 21st century under global warming chen and yuan 2021 4 3 sustainability of agricultural irrigation in the future the simulation results in this study showed that the average annual ngu in the plain area reached approximately 300 mm in the historical period fig 13c1 the ngu was positive in both historical and future climate change scenarios during the wheat growing season fig 13a1 a5 under the same ssps the ngu during wheat growing season showed a trend of gradual decrease over time fig 13a2 a5 which indicated that future climate change was likely to have a positive impact on groundwater recovery in this study area in the historical period the ngu during the maize growing season was positive in most regions fig 13b1 indicating that groundwater storage was also decreasing but was not as much as that of the wheat growing season this was mainly because summer maize grew in the season with 80 annual precipitation however the ngu values in almost the entire plains were negative during the maize growing season under the four future climate scenarios the absolute values of ngu for summer maize increased over time under the same ssps fig 13b2 b5 which represented that the groundwater received a certain degree of recharge the annual ngu was positive in both historical period and future climate change scenarios except for the ssp585 2080s scenario fig 13c1 c4 indicating that groundwater in the plain area would still be in deficit in the future the annual ngu values in some zones were negative under the ssp585 2080s scenario fig 13c5 denoting that the percolation amount was greater than the irrigation amount compared with the historical period the ngu decreased from the 2050s to the 2080s in the same ssps fig 14c indicating that the decreasing groundwater storage in the plain was likely to slow down in the future 5 conclusions the changes of meteorological elements water balance components crop yield cwp and ngu were simulated based on 27 gcms from the latest cmip6 and well calibrated swat mad model the simulation results showed air temperatures and solar radiation increased under future climate scenarios especially the temperature increased most in the ssp585 2080s scenario and the solar radiation increased most in the ssp245 2080s scenario moreover precipitation surface runoff percolation and soil water content increased however irrigation decreased in the future overall etc decreased during crop growing seasons in the future climate change scenarios the crop yields of winter wheat and summer maize would increase in the future in the whole plain area winter wheat yield increased almost in all ssps gcms and time periods for summer maize almost all gcms predicted yield increased except for the ssp585 2080s scenario with the highest co2 concentration and air temperatures winter wheat yield increased by 10 0 17 1 in the 2050s and 2080s under ssp245 and ssp585 respectively 27 gcms predicted summer maize yield increased by 6 1 12 6 in the four future climate change scenarios therefore winter wheat yields respond more positively to future climate change although ngu decreased as irrigation decreased and percolation increased under the future climate scenarios groundwater storage remained at a deficit however ngu was negative during maize growing season indicating that the percolation was larger than irrigation and ngu values decreased during the wheat growing season over time to a certain extent groundwater overexploitation could be mitigated the results of future climate change and their implications for crop production in this study can provide decision making support for agricultural irrigation

with a short vegetation period it has relatively high drought tolerance and potential for decreasing the present gap between consuming and producing the edible oil since it comprises 17 20 protein and

following plowing and disk harrowing had a length of 5 m and contained eight rows with a distance of 0 6 m a path of 2 m width was considered between the plots to eliminate the effects of lateral water movements the mycorrhizal fungal inoculants included hyphal root particles and spores from the stock cultures of rhizophagus intraradices r intraradices and funneliformis mosseae f mosseae the inocula were used in a dose of 60 g m 2 150 spores per ml of inoculum the r intraradices and f mosseae inocula were provided as sheer isolates from the soil and water research institute karaj iran in early june the late maturing sesame cultivar oltan seeds were inoculated with inoculants considering that the plants were at a distance of 8 cm in the rows their density was nearly 21 plants m 2 on the basis of the sesame requirement for n and the n content of the soil calculated that 100 kg n ha 1 was needed for sesame production half of the n fertilizer from urea source was applied at four to the five leaf stage and the rest was used at nine to the ten leaf stage no potassium k or p fertilization was necessary based on the soil analysis results a randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement and three replications were implemented irrigation treatments were allocated to the main plots as follows irrigation was started after depleting 45 full irrigation 65 moderate

intervals a volume counter felenji 3 in farasanj fr wi iran with a polyethylene pipe irrigation network to control irrigation was installed different irrigation regimes were applied to the plots when plants were at the four leaf stage the total amount of irrigation applied was recorded as 7350 3800 and 2050 m3 ha 1 in the 2017 growing season and 7150 3270 and 1950 m3 ha 1 in the 2018 growing season under full irrigation moderate and severe drought stress treatments respectively all weeds were removed during the growing season manually 2 4 data collection to determine leaf n p and k contents the leaf samples were collected at the flowering stage from the uppermost completely developed leaf of five plants from each plot followed by oven drying for 105 c for 0 5 h followed by 80 c until the constant weight was attained and powdering via an electric mill the kjeldahl technique was used to measure n jiang et al 2014 the total p content was determined spectrophotometrically using the vanado molybdate phosphoric acid yellow color method jackson 2005 the flame photometry method was applied to measure k after the 70 days of drought stress imposed root samples were collected washed and stained with trypan blue and then according to the biermann and linderman 1981 method mycorrhizal colonization rate was measured six m2 of each experimental plot was harvested by hand to quantify the grain yield at the physiological maturity stage seed oil content was determined using a nuclear magnetic resonance minispec mq 20 nmr analyzer bruker rheinstetten germany the oil yield

the seeds k concentration was measured with flame photometry using a jenway pfp7 c research flame photometer uk furthermore to calculate irrigation water productivity wpi the grain yield kg ha 1 was divided by the total applied irrigation water m3 ha 1 fernández et al 2020 gholamhoseini et al 2013 the mycorrhizal dependency md for each treatment was estimated as follows tawaraya 2003 md grain yield of the inoculated plant grain yield of noninoculated plant grain yield of the inoculated plant 100 2 5 statistical analysis sas software version 9 4 was used to analyze variance on the data sas institute 2002 because bartlett s test did not show homogeneity of variance in most of the studied traits table s1 data were subjected to analysis of variance year by year differences between the main effects of treatments were compared using the protected lsd at the 0 05 probability level when the f test was significant the slicing method was used to separate the significant interaction effects 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of variance the analysis of variance showed that the main effects of the irrigation regimes and mycorrhizal treatments were statistically significant on all parameters except for the effect of irrigation regimes on wpi in 2017 and mycorrhizal treatments on oil yield in 2018 table s2 in addition the interaction effect of irrigation regimes and mycorrhizal treatments significantly influenced all traits except for seed oil content in 2017 and 2018 table s2 3 2 mycorrhizal colonization rate the root colonization rate in the noninoculated plants was considerably lower during both seasons than the inoculated plants irrespective of irrigation treatments table 2 fig s2 revealing the low population rates of the mycorrhizae in the soil after 70 days since drought stress initiation full irrigation moderate and severe drought stress treatments respectively revealed the colonization of 54 42 and 37 with r intraradices and 61 53 and 51 with f mosseae in 2017 as well as 58 49 and 41 colonization with r intraradices and 69 62 and 55 with f mosseae in 2018 table 2 the results indicated that inoculated plants not subjected to drought stress treatments demonstrated the maximum colonization rate secondly the negative effect of drought stress on the colonization rate increased with increasing stress intensity the possible reason for decreasing colonization rate under stress conditions is the absorbed contents of mycorrhizal fungi by the host plants evelin et al 2009 the results also showed that the greatest colonization rate was related to f mosseae inoculated roots in each irrigation treatment table 2 different mycorrhizal colonization rates might be due to different performances of mycorrhizal fungi species even under similar conditions therefore a greater rate of colonization in f mosseae inoculated plants than plants inoculated with r intraradices under different irrigation treatments revealed that f mosseae species is the most aggressive colonizer or the best adapted under stress and nonstress conditions 3 3 n p and k content in the leaf and seed although drought stress decreased n content in the leaf and seed amf especially when the plants were inoculated with f mosseae reducing the adverse effects of drought stress fig 1a and b when averaged over both seasons the reduction percentage of n content due to severe drought stress was 42 for leaf and 23 for seed for the noninoculated plants 24 for leaf and 20 for seed for the plants inoculated with f mosseae and 38 for leaf and 28 for seed for the plants inoculated with r intraradices in other words the data demonstrated that the inoculated plants had higher n percentages in both the leaves and the seeds under the different drought stress intensities fig 1a and b according to previous findings amf enhances n uptake in drought stressed crops by enhancing root hydraulic conductivity aroca et al 2008 baum et al 2015 stated that amf obtains n from organic materials by increasing decomposition however this source of n is not available for noninoculated crops this increase in n uptake supports the host crop in retaining its water status under drought stress conditions as noted f mosseae mycorrhizal hyphae cooperated further for n absorption than the plants inoculated by r intraradices the superiority of f mosseae can be due to faster penetration martin et al 2012 and better establishment chen et al 2017 of this fungus in the host plant s roots like previous results the leaf and seed p content in inoculated plants were less affected by drought stress fig 2a and b when averaged over seasons p content in inoculated plants was 10 for leaf and 7 for seed higher than noninoculated plants grown under full irrigation 39 for leaf and 21 for seed under moderate drought stress and finally 63 for leaf and 36 for seed under severe drought stress conditions respectively there are two procedures by which crop p uptake could be improved via the inoculation of amf 1 by increasing p availability accelerated by the spacious fungus hyphae enabling roots to discover different soil mass than can the non amf crops weisany et al 2016 warren 2011 and 2 by enhancing the microbial biomass in the soil gheisari zardak et al 2017 stated that microbial biomass enhances when amf settle in the soil this leads to enhancing the co2 concentration of the soil which forms carbonic acid in the soil solution this acid could solve primitive p containing minerals thus enhancing p accessibility the results also revealed that f mosseae inoculated plants cumulated more p in their leaves and seeds than r intraradices inoculated or noninoculated plants grown under different irrigation treatments in both seasons fig 2a and b as mentioned this species is the most adapted or the best colonizer especially under drought stress conditions although it has been reported that the association between amf and the host crop is non specific piotrowski et al 2004 under stressful conditions there might be associations of am host crop which are further effective the results showed that am treatments enhanced leaf and seed k content the plants received full irrigation and inoculated with f mosseae showed the maximum leaf and seed k content in both seasons fig 3a and b potassium has a central role in crop metabolism mainly under stressful conditions and activates various enzymes aksu and altay 2020 the results showed that mycorrhizal symbiosis could improve k uptake by sesame the incremented p accessibility can cause the incremented k concentration due to amf activity in other words there is a synergistic association between p and k uptake zhang et al 2006 and p accessibility in soil enhanced k uptake by crops 3 4 grain yield and irrigation water productivity wp i the grain yield rose by 7 in the second year compared to the first year presumably because of more favorable climatic conditions in other words when sesame crop is grown in hot conditions days with ambient temperature above 40 c especially in august and september which coincides with the flowering and seed filling stages of sesame like the first year of the experiment fig s1 it tends to produce lower grain yield due to the negative effect of high temperature on the pollination inoculation and fertility of flowers nath et al 2001 in both inoculated and noninoculated sesame plants drought stress significantly reduced sesame grain yield fig 4 compared with the full irrigation the moderate and severe drought stress treatment decreased inoculated sesame grain yield by 31 and 65 and noninoculated sesame grain yield by 38 and 78 averaged over seasons respectively this difference might be due to efficient root systems bitterlich et al 2018 and or lower stomatal resistance and low temperature of leaves in inoculated crops bunn et al 2009 compared to noninoculated crops especially under drought stress conditions in other words in inoculated sesames mycorrhizal symbiosis restrains adverse impacts of drought stress on sesame grain yield the results of both years showed that the impacts of amf on mitigation of drought stress became more with enhancing drought stress intensity fig 4 these results reveal that if proper symbiosis of amf is attainable sesame will have a substantial ability to produce acceptable grain yields even under drought stress conditions it has been reported that relations between roots and amf improve the amount of p absorbed by crop roots under water shortage conditions clark and zeto 2000 following increased p uptake inoculated crops with amf mostly produce higher biological and grain yields than plants without amf in addition enhanced p uptake because of attendance of amf under drought stress conditions has been suggested as the main mechanism for the improved drought resistance of the host crops bárzana et al 2014 enhanced p uptake increases drought resistance through increased stomatal conductance jin et al 2015 and enhanced transpiration al karaki et al 1995 averaged over both seasons the difference between the grain yield of f mosseae inoculated plants with r intraradices inoculated plants reached 112 and 84 kg grain ha 1 under moderate and severe drought stress treatment respectively fig 4 in other words the results revealed that f mosseae was a more efficient fungal symbiont for enhancing the drought resistance of sesame both in terms of growth and grain yield production under drought stress conditions as mentioned before various fungi had different colonization rates table 2 therefore different mycorrhizal species have different impact on sesame growth and yield the superiority of f mosseae inoculated sesames to absorption more nutrients figs 1 3 and higher leaf relative water content data not shown most likely clarify the results in addition the rapid growth of f mosseae hyphae stated by chen et al 2017 may be explained the results in enhancement of sesame growth compared to r intraradices slower growing hyphae the results showed that during both seasons f mosseae inoculated plants represented the maximum wpi although no significant differences were found among treatments under the full irrigation regime table 3 in addition the positive impact of mycorrhizal symbiosis on wpi was higher under severe drought stress than moderate drought stress conditions under moderate and severe drought stress mycorrhizal association compared with control enhanced wpi by 11 and 22 in the first and 22 and 71 in the second year respectively our data agree with the results of others augé 2001 grümberg et al 2015 who stated that mycorrhizal assisted host crop drought resistance and the wpi enhancement under drought stress conditions as mentioned above f mosseae inoculation significantly enhanced wpi compared with the r intraradices inoculated plants under different drought stress intensities differences between mycorrhizal species regarding wpi are caused by their different capacities for producing external mycelia jansa et al 2008 which directly affect water availability for the crop in the soil in addition this difference might be due to the differences in mycorrhizal species origin r intraradices species was originated from the humid area and f mosseae species was selected from arid regions in iran which improved its ability to confer drought resistance of the host crops consequently enhancing the wpi 3 5 seed oil content and oil yield in both seasons severe drought stress treatment showed the lowest seed oil content being 10 and 8 lower than for full irrigation treatment which had the highest seed oil content in the first and second year respectively table 4 gholamhoseini 2020 stated that environmental factors could change the seed oil content of sesame and drought stress is the most critical factor influencing the synthesis of oil in oilseed crops it has been reported that abscisic acid synthesized in the leaves of stressed crops is dislocated to the seeds and therefore participates in reducing seed oil content elferjani and soolanayakanahally 2018 the results demonstrated that the amf inoculated treatment enhanced seed oil content compared to the non amf inoculated treatment table 4 an increase in seed oil content may be due to an increment in p accessibility in the soil due to mycorrhizal symbiosis moreover seed oil in oilseed crops like sesame is based on the phospholipid structures wang and frei 2011 and their constructor units require the various nutrients especially p thus enhanced p uptake on account of amf has been assumed as the main mechanism for the increased seed oil content in sesame oil yield in oilseed crops demonstrates seed quality and yield quantity although amf inoculation enhanced oil yield in all irrigation regimes its effect was more pronounced under moderate drought stress conditions table 3 nevertheless the oil yields gained from inoculated sesames were higher than those from the noninoculated ones irrespective of water availability the results showed that oil yield in f mosseae inoculated sesames was 9 13 and 19 higher than oil yield for sesame inoculated with r intraradices under full irrigation moderate and severe drought stress conditions respectively the f mosseae inoculation treatment was a more efficient symbiosis for enhancing sesame oil yield the results demonstrated that differing amf species even within the same genus have different impacts on sesame production due to different spore dormancy patterns juge et al 2000 and various penetration capabilities to host roots giovannetti et al 1993 diverse mycorrhizal species have different root colonization ability consequently different effects on crop growth the results confirmed that f mosseae could enhance sesame yield and drought tolerance to a superior level than r intraradices these enhancements are attributed to superior colonization of sesames by f mosseae compared to r intraradices because of a better adaption of this species to its native environments in the sense of benefiting its hosts best given these soil climate conditions 3 6 mycorrhizal dependency md sesame plants grown under drought stress represented more pronounced md than those that received full irrigation treatment table 5 in addition plants inoculated with f mosseae and grown under either moderate or severe drought stress treatments showed enhanced md compared with sesames inoculated with r intraradices table 5 the md is identified as the percentage of crop yield enhancement due to mycorrhizal colonization tawaraya 2003 under drought stress the less yield loss of sesame depended greatly on the presence of the amf demonstrating that amf colonization can alleviate the damaging impacts of the drought stress on the yield of sesame however the two fungal species varied in their potential for different traits of the two mycorrhizal species f mosseae responded more effectively it significantly enhanced sesame grain yield compared with non mycorrhizal sesames while r intraradices responded less effectively consequently it is expected that a significant enhancement in the f mosseae inoculated sesames md will appear in relation to r intraradices inoculated sesames especially under stressful conditions 4 conclusion briefly our findings showed that amf inoculation significantly affects growth and yield in sesame as we showed that sesame could be a mycorrhizal dependent crop inoculation with amf is a sustainable strategy to improve the advantages of symbiosis moreover choosing amf species for application into arid and semi arid regions to tackle drought stress is a promising but generally disregarded strategy the results demonstrate that f mosseae is more efficient under drought stress for supporting sesame crops the application of these microorganisms could be essential in the farming of sesame under stressful

the five leaf stage and the rest was used at nine to the ten leaf stage no potassium k or p fertilization was necessary based on the soil analysis results a randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement and three replications were implemented irrigation treatments were allocated to the main plots as follows irrigation was started after depleting 45 full irrigation 65 moderate drought stress and 85 severe drought stress of the available water the mycorrhizal subplot treatments were seed inoculation with r intraradices f mosseae and no inoculation control the soil water content percent volumetric moisture was measured and recorded using tdr time domain reflectometry equipment trase system 1 6050 1 soilmoisture equipment corp usa at 0 0 8 m soil depth at 0 2 m intervals a volume counter felenji 3 in farasanj fr wi iran with a polyethylene pipe irrigation network to control irrigation was installed different irrigation regimes were applied to the plots when plants were at the four leaf stage the total amount of irrigation applied was recorded as 7350 3800 and 2050 m3 ha 1 in the 2017 growing season and 7150 3270 and 1950 m3 ha 1 in the 2018 growing season under full irrigation moderate and severe drought stress treatments respectively all weeds were removed during the growing season manually 2 4 data collection to determine leaf n p and k contents the leaf samples were collected at the flowering stage from the uppermost completely developed leaf of five plants from each plot followed by oven drying for 105 c for 0 5 h followed by 80 c until the constant weight was attained and powdering via an electric mill the kjeldahl technique was used to measure n jiang et al 2014 the total p content was determined spectrophotometrically using the vanado molybdate phosphoric acid yellow color method jackson 2005 the flame photometry method was applied to measure k after the 70 days of drought stress imposed root samples were collected washed and stained with trypan blue and then according to the biermann and linderman 1981 method mycorrhizal colonization rate was measured six m2 of each experimental plot was harvested by hand to quantify the grain yield at the physiological maturity stage seed oil content was determined using a nuclear magnetic resonance minispec mq 20 nmr analyzer bruker rheinstetten germany the oil yield was calculated by multiplying the seed oil percentage by grain yield phosphorus concentration in seeds was measured using the calorimetry method using a 6505 jenway spectrophotometer speck burke uk the seeds k concentration was measured with flame photometry using a jenway pfp7 c research flame photometer uk furthermore to calculate irrigation water productivity wpi the grain yield kg ha 1 was divided by the total applied irrigation water m3 ha 1 fernández et al 2020 gholamhoseini et al 2013 the mycorrhizal dependency md for each treatment was estimated as follows tawaraya 2003 md grain yield of the inoculated plant grain yield of noninoculated plant grain yield of the inoculated plant 100 2 5 statistical analysis sas software version 9 4 was used to analyze variance on the data sas institute 2002 because bartlett s test did not show homogeneity of variance in most of the studied traits table s1 data were subjected to analysis of variance year by year differences between the main effects of treatments were compared using the protected lsd at the 0 05 probability level when the f test was significant the slicing method was used to separate the significant interaction effects 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of variance the analysis of variance showed that the main effects of the irrigation regimes and mycorrhizal treatments were statistically significant on all parameters except for the effect of irrigation regimes on wpi in 2017 and mycorrhizal treatments on oil yield in 2018 table s2 in addition the interaction effect of irrigation regimes and mycorrhizal treatments significantly influenced all traits except for seed oil content in 2017 and 2018 table s2 3 2 mycorrhizal colonization rate the root colonization rate in the noninoculated plants was considerably lower during both seasons than the inoculated plants irrespective of irrigation treatments table 2 fig s2 revealing the low population rates of the mycorrhizae in the soil after 70 days since drought stress initiation full irrigation moderate and severe drought stress treatments respectively revealed the colonization of 54 42 and 37 with r intraradices and 61 53 and 51 with f mosseae in 2017 as well as 58 49 and 41 colonization with r intraradices and 69 62 and 55 with f mosseae in 2018 table 2 the results indicated that inoculated plants not subjected to drought stress treatments demonstrated the maximum colonization rate secondly the negative effect of drought stress on the colonization rate increased with increasing stress intensity the possible reason for decreasing colonization rate under stress conditions is the absorbed contents of mycorrhizal fungi by the host plants evelin et al 2009 the results also showed that the greatest colonization rate was related to f mosseae inoculated roots in each irrigation treatment table 2 different mycorrhizal colonization rates might be due to different performances of mycorrhizal fungi species even under similar conditions therefore a greater rate of colonization in f mosseae inoculated plants than plants inoculated with r intraradices under different irrigation treatments revealed that f mosseae species is the most aggressive colonizer or the best adapted under stress and nonstress conditions 3 3 n p and k content in the leaf and seed although drought stress decreased n content in the leaf and seed amf especially when the plants were inoculated with f mosseae reducing the adverse effects of drought stress fig 1a and b when averaged over both seasons the reduction percentage of n content due to severe drought stress was 42 for leaf and 23 for seed for the noninoculated plants 24 for leaf and 20 for seed for the plants inoculated with f mosseae and 38 for leaf and 28 for seed for the plants inoculated with r intraradices in other words the data demonstrated that the inoculated plants had higher n percentages in both the leaves and the seeds under the different drought stress intensities fig 1a and b according to previous findings amf enhances n uptake in drought stressed crops by enhancing root hydraulic conductivity aroca et al 2008 baum et al 2015 stated that amf obtains n from organic materials by increasing decomposition however this source of n is not available for noninoculated crops this increase in n uptake supports the host crop in retaining its water status under drought stress conditions as noted f mosseae mycorrhizal hyphae cooperated further for n absorption than the plants inoculated by r intraradices the superiority of f mosseae can be due to faster penetration martin et al 2012 and better establishment chen et al 2017 of this fungus in the host plant s roots like previous results the leaf and seed p content in inoculated plants were less affected by drought stress fig 2a and b when averaged over seasons p content in inoculated plants was 10 for leaf and 7 for seed higher than noninoculated plants grown under full irrigation 39 for leaf and 21 for seed under moderate drought stress and finally 63 for leaf and 36 for seed under severe drought stress conditions respectively there are two procedures by which crop p uptake could be improved via the inoculation of amf 1 by increasing p availability accelerated by the spacious fungus hyphae enabling roots to discover different soil mass than can the non amf crops weisany et al 2016 warren 2011 and 2 by enhancing the microbial biomass in the soil gheisari zardak et al 2017 stated that microbial biomass enhances when amf settle in the soil this leads to enhancing the co2 concentration of the soil which forms carbonic acid in the soil solution this acid could solve primitive p containing minerals thus enhancing p accessibility the results also revealed that f mosseae inoculated plants cumulated more p in their leaves and seeds than r intraradices inoculated or noninoculated plants grown under different irrigation treatments in both seasons fig 2a and b as mentioned this species is the most adapted or the best colonizer especially under drought stress conditions although it has been reported that the association between amf and the host crop is non specific piotrowski et al 2004 under stressful conditions there might be associations of am host crop which are further effective the results showed that am treatments enhanced leaf and seed k content the plants received full irrigation and inoculated with f mosseae showed the maximum leaf and seed k content in both seasons fig 3a and b potassium has a central role in crop metabolism mainly under stressful conditions and activates various enzymes aksu and altay 2020 the results showed that mycorrhizal symbiosis could improve k uptake by sesame the incremented p accessibility can cause the incremented k concentration due to amf activity in other words there is a synergistic association between p and k uptake zhang et al 2006 and p accessibility in soil enhanced k uptake by crops 3 4 grain yield and irrigation water productivity wp i the grain yield rose by 7 in the second year compared to the first year presumably because of more favorable climatic conditions in other words when sesame crop is grown in hot conditions days with ambient temperature above 40 c especially in august and september which coincides with the flowering and seed filling stages of sesame like the first year of the experiment fig s1 it tends to produce lower grain yield due to the negative effect of high temperature on the pollination inoculation and fertility of flowers nath et al 2001 in both inoculated and noninoculated sesame plants drought stress significantly reduced sesame grain yield fig 4 compared with the full irrigation the moderate and severe drought stress treatment decreased inoculated sesame grain yield by 31 and 65 and noninoculated sesame grain yield by 38 and 78 averaged over seasons respectively this difference might be due to efficient root systems bitterlich et al 2018 and or lower stomatal resistance and low temperature of leaves in inoculated crops bunn et al 2009 compared to noninoculated crops especially under drought stress conditions in other words in inoculated sesames mycorrhizal symbiosis restrains adverse impacts of drought stress on sesame grain yield the results of both years showed that the impacts of amf on mitigation of drought stress became more with enhancing drought stress intensity fig 4 these results reveal that if proper symbiosis of amf is attainable sesame will have a substantial ability to produce acceptable grain yields even under drought stress conditions it has been reported that relations between roots and amf improve the amount of p absorbed by crop roots under water shortage conditions clark and zeto 2000 following increased p uptake inoculated crops with amf mostly produce higher biological and grain yields than plants without amf in addition enhanced p uptake because of attendance of amf under drought stress conditions has been suggested as the main mechanism for the improved drought resistance of the host crops bárzana et al 2014 enhanced p uptake increases drought resistance through increased stomatal conductance jin et al 2015 and enhanced transpiration al karaki et al 1995 averaged over both seasons the difference between the grain yield of f mosseae inoculated plants with r intraradices inoculated plants reached 112 and 84 kg grain ha 1 under moderate and severe drought stress treatment respectively fig 4 in other words the results revealed that f mosseae was a more efficient fungal symbiont for enhancing the drought resistance of sesame both in terms of growth and grain yield production under drought stress conditions as mentioned before various fungi had different colonization rates table 2 therefore different mycorrhizal species have different impact on sesame growth and yield the superiority of f mosseae inoculated sesames to absorption more nutrients figs 1 3 and higher leaf relative water content data not shown most likely clarify the results in addition the rapid growth of f mosseae hyphae stated by chen et al 2017 may be explained the results in enhancement of sesame growth compared to r intraradices slower growing hyphae the results showed that during both seasons f mosseae inoculated plants represented the maximum wpi although no significant differences were found among treatments under the full irrigation regime table 3 in addition the positive impact of mycorrhizal symbiosis on wpi was higher under severe drought stress than moderate drought stress conditions under moderate and severe drought stress mycorrhizal association compared with control enhanced wpi by 11 and 22 in the first and 22 and 71 in the second year respectively our data agree with the results of others augé 2001 grümberg et al 2015 who stated that mycorrhizal assisted host crop drought resistance and the wpi enhancement under drought stress conditions as mentioned above f mosseae inoculation significantly enhanced wpi compared with the r intraradices inoculated plants under different drought stress intensities differences between mycorrhizal species regarding wpi are caused by their different capacities for producing external mycelia jansa et al 2008 which directly affect water availability for the crop in the soil in addition this difference might be due to the differences in mycorrhizal species origin r intraradices species was originated from the humid area and f mosseae species was selected from arid regions in iran which improved its ability to confer drought resistance of the host crops consequently enhancing the wpi 3 5 seed oil content and oil yield in both seasons severe drought stress treatment showed the lowest seed oil content being 10 and 8 lower than for full irrigation treatment which had the highest seed oil content in the first and second year respectively table 4 gholamhoseini 2020 stated that environmental factors could change the seed oil content of sesame and drought stress is the most critical factor influencing the synthesis of oil in oilseed crops it has been reported that abscisic acid synthesized in the leaves of stressed crops is dislocated to the seeds and therefore participates in reducing seed oil content elferjani and soolanayakanahally 2018 the results demonstrated that the amf inoculated treatment enhanced seed oil content compared to the non amf inoculated treatment table 4 an increase in seed oil content may be due to an increment in p accessibility in the soil due to mycorrhizal symbiosis moreover seed oil in oilseed crops like sesame is based on the phospholipid structures wang and frei 2011 and their constructor units require the various nutrients especially p thus enhanced p uptake on account of amf has been assumed as the main mechanism for the increased seed oil content in sesame oil yield in oilseed crops demonstrates seed quality and yield quantity although amf inoculation enhanced oil yield in all irrigation regimes its effect was more pronounced under moderate drought stress conditions table 3 nevertheless the oil yields gained from inoculated sesames were higher than those from the noninoculated ones irrespective of water availability the results showed that oil yield in f mosseae inoculated sesames was 9 13 and 19 higher than oil yield for sesame inoculated with r intraradices under full irrigation moderate and severe drought stress conditions respectively the f mosseae inoculation treatment was a more efficient symbiosis for enhancing sesame oil yield the results demonstrated that differing amf species even within the same genus have different impacts on sesame production due to different spore dormancy patterns juge et al 2000 and various penetration capabilities to host roots giovannetti et al 1993 diverse mycorrhizal species have different root colonization ability consequently different effects on crop growth the results confirmed that f mosseae could enhance sesame yield and drought tolerance to a superior level than r intraradices these enhancements are attributed to superior colonization of sesames by f mosseae compared to r intraradices because of a better adaption of this species to its native environments in the sense of benefiting its hosts best given these soil climate conditions 3 6 mycorrhizal dependency md sesame plants grown under drought stress represented more pronounced md than those that received full irrigation treatment table 5 in addition plants inoculated with f mosseae and grown under either moderate or severe drought stress treatments showed enhanced md compared with sesames inoculated with r intraradices table 5 the md is identified as the percentage of crop yield enhancement due to mycorrhizal colonization tawaraya 2003 under drought stress the less yield loss of sesame depended greatly on the presence of the amf demonstrating that amf colonization can alleviate the damaging impacts of the drought stress on the yield of sesame however the two fungal species varied in their potential for different traits of the two mycorrhizal species f mosseae responded more effectively it significantly enhanced sesame grain yield compared with non mycorrhizal sesames while r intraradices responded less effectively consequently it is expected that a significant enhancement in the f mosseae inoculated sesames md will appear in relation to r intraradices inoculated sesames especially under stressful conditions 4 conclusion briefly our findings showed that amf inoculation significantly affects growth and yield in sesame as we showed that sesame could be a mycorrhizal dependent crop inoculation with amf is a sustainable strategy to improve the advantages of symbiosis moreover choosing amf species for application into arid and semi arid regions to tackle drought stress is a promising but generally disregarded strategy the results demonstrate that f mosseae is more efficient under drought stress for supporting sesame crops the application of these microorganisms could be essential in the farming of sesame under stressful environments where water is the main factor affecting crop performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9542,drought monitoring and understanding of spatiotemporal patterns of drought characteristics are beneficial for sustainable agricultural water management at a regional scale changes in rainfall and drought patterns in future could impact decision making in water resources allocation the impacts of potential climate change on future meteorological droughts could be better analysed by utilizing an index that incorporates the number of rainy days information in addition to magnitude of rainfall to characterize the drought severity in this study we propose a bivariate copula based multi scalar rainfall pattern drought index rpdi a variant of the popular standardized precipitation index spi and then the drought characteristics in india based on rpdi and spi at different time scales 3 6 and 12 months are analysed when compared to rpdi spi underestimated drought severity and indicated low spatial heterogeneity of drought characteristics the rpdi analysis identified changes in average drought severity and total number of drought events between two sample time slices 1920 1960 and 1961 2000 in the historical period future rpdi drought characteristics based on the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 multi model ensemble under two emission scenarios known as shared socioeconomic pathways ssps ssp126 and ssp245 are then computed when drought characteristics in the near future 2020 2049 and far future 2070 2099 periods are compared with their baseline period 1985 2014 values the results show that a significant declining trend is likely in the total number of drought events over the study region while increases are projected in the maximum drought duration and maximum drought severity in future long term drought characteristics extracted using 12 months scale rpdi are likely to intensify in future under both scenarios considering the effects of erratic rainfall pattern on agricultural productivity the rpdi drought monitoring framework could be utilized for efficient agricultural water management in future keywords rainfall pattern drought index copula climate change drought characteristics cmip6 ensemble data availability the gridded

south asia prepared by mishra et al 2020b are available in public domain at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3873998 1 introduction droughts characterized by prolonged periods of deficit in water availability have been known to affect agricultural productivity and economy of global communities more than any other hydrological extreme hao and aghakouchak 2013 ayanlade et al 2018 it is well known fact that the definition of drought event depends on the nature of water deficit existing in the study region heim 2002 droughts can be broadly classified into four types meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic droughts mishra and singh 2010 precipitation deficits that act as the driver of meteorological droughts can eventually cause agricultural hydrological and socio economic droughts the creeping nature of droughts compounded with their large scale impacts makes drought analysis quite complex and uncertain yet drought studies are vital for agricultural water management water resources planning natural hazard risk assessment and adaptation planning huang et al 2015 samantaray et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 han et al 2021 the focus of the present study is on meteorological drought monitoring based on rainfall pattern that is very likely to change in future owing to the phenomena of global warming and climate change though there are numerous meteorological drought indices available in the literature namely the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 among others these do not incorporate rainfall pattern to compute the drought severity by far the spi is most popular drought index among these indices owing to its simple framework multi scalar definition that enables monitoring of both short term and long term droughts and flexibility to compare across different locations thomas et al 2015 salvi and ghosh 2016 kalisa et al 2020 dai et al 2020 the spi is recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo as a standard index to complement the traditional drought monitoring approaches few limitations of spi such as i use of a fixed threshold for drought categorization without accounting for uncertainty mallya et al 2015 ramadas and govindaraju 2015 and ii poor performance in regions where precipitation is strongly seasonal and periodic chanda and maity 2015 are addressed by researchers in the recent times the standardized nonstationary precipitation index snspi russo et al 2013 and standardized precipitation anomaly index spai chanda and maity 2015 are available in literature as improved versions of spi and can be calculated for a variety of time scales 1 3 6 12 24 months additionally studies have combined multiple characteristics and types of droughts to develop different meteorological drought indices shah and mishra 2015 aadhar and mishra 2017 yet they have not addressed the rainfall pattern or temporal distribution of precipitation events in the context of studying droughts based on rainfall pattern murthy et al 2015 observed that drought monitoring based on rainfall and rainy days together as inputs identified more locations affected by droughts when compared to rainfall alone as the drought indicator their study pointed out that rainfall and rainy days based drought assessment are not correlated meaning considering one aspect alone could lead to inaccurate drought assessment drought hazard assessment using a composite index incorporating rainfall and rainy days statistics was performed by murthy et al 2017 that captured the spatiotemporal drought patterns over their study region singh et al 2021 proposed the standardized net precipitation distribution index snepi based on time distribution of net precipitation variable and compared its ability to capture rainfall pattern change with spei the number of rainy days has a significant impact on the food grain production and yield revadekar and preethi 2012 traore et al 2013 prasanna 2014 baffour ata et al 2021 for this reason it is recommended that the rainy days information be incorporated while quantifying meteorological droughts and further could add value to agricultural drought monitoring studies using popular indices based on vegetation condition indices soil moisture deficit and crop stress and crop yield in general light to moderate rain events act as soaking rain that replenish the soil moisture storage and resulting in relatively low runoff rates and streamflow trenberth et al 2003 extremely wet events that result in increased runoff yet unable to alleviate droughts have been common in recent decades along with prolonged dry spells zhou et al 2018 ajjur and riffi 2020 therefore in the context of drought definition a rainfall magnitude associated with fewer rainy days in a month would impact the stakeholders differently compared to a greater number of rainy days and changes in the rainfall pattern could influence the drought risk of a study region sun et al 2006 groisman and knight 2008 changes in rainfall pattern could be attributed to changes in topography natural climatic variability anthropogenic climate change and land use land cover changes and are of great relevance to the socio economic development of the region kharol et al 2013 herold et al 2016a 2016b few studies have utilized simple daily intensity index sdii or the mean precipitation in wet days to assess changes in rainfall pattern herold et al 2016a 2016b attogouinon et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 ajjur and riffi 2020 pohl et al 2017 assessed the impacts of climate change on the rainfall extreme events over southern africa and projected an increase in extreme rainfall intensity and a decrease in the number of rainy days in the future periods the recent studies suggest that drought risk assessment can no longer assume that climate is stationary milly et al 2008 zhai et al 2020 samantaray et al 2021 xu et al 2021 therefore drastic changes in the pattern and intensity of rainfall need to be addressed in drought risk analysis even if the total rainfall does not present any temporal trend attogouinon et al 2017 trenberth and zhang 2018 hence concurrent analyses of rainfall rainy days and meteorological droughts are crucial for modelling rainfall characteristics and drought events pathak and dodamani 2020 the effect of temporal distribution of total rainfall in a month on the severity of a dry wet condition at a location is a knowledge gap in existing drought monitoring that needs to be addressed groisman and knight 2008 mishra and liu 2014 singh et al 2021 therefore a new meteorological drought index called rainfall pattern drought index rpdi is discussed in this study wherein a given rainfall magnitude occurring with different patterns are considered as dry wet events with different severities and impacts the novel rpdi framework can address changes in rainfall pattern while quantifying drought characteristics in future under potential climate change the objectives of the present study are i to develop rpdi for meteorological drought monitoring as a variant of spi with incorporation of rainy days information and ii to assess the spatiotemporal variability of drought characteristics in future periods using global climate model based rainfall projections 2 data the development of rpdi is performed over india which is an agriculture dominated economy and vulnerable to drought extremes and associated losses in crop productivity kharol et al 2013 das et al 2014 mallya et al 2016 india receives about 80 of its annual rainfall during the june to september period and is termed as the all india summer monsoon rainfall aismr severe droughts are known to account for about two to five percent of gross domestic product gdp loss annually in india gadgil and gadgil 2006 and being a rain fed agricultural country meteorological droughts impact its rural population in many ways studies also suggest that a decreasing trend of rainfall compounded with decline in number of rainy days may exacerbate droughts in water stressed regions of the country kumar and jain 2011 das et al 2014 mishra and liu 2014 these findings emphasize the need to characterize meteorological droughts in india based on rainfall patterns in the present study gridded daily rainfall data for india obtained from the india meteorological department imd at spatial resolution 0 25 is used as observed rainfall for the estimation of rpdi this high resolution dataset prepared by pai et al 2014 using the observed rainfall measurements from 6955 rain gauge stations in india with varying availability period from 1901 to 2013 is popularly adopted for meteorological drought studies the dataset for the 1920 2000 period is used for index development in this study the drought events in two historical time slices 1920 1960 and 1961 2000 are analysed for comparing spatiotemporal variability of rpdi and spi based drought characteristics additionally for validating the performance of the index as an agricultural drought

popular indicators used in agricultural drought studies for monitoring vegetation health and stress cai and sharma 2010 garcía león et al 2019 in this study for future drought analysis the coupled multi model inter comparison project version 6 cmip6 general circulation model gcm outputs are used the phase 6 model simulations are considered more robust than previous phases and have been used for studying droughts in south asia and india zhai et al 2020 shrestha et al 2020 gusain et al 2020 the climate change scenarios in cmip6 are termed as shared socioeconomic pathways ssps that project a

and ssp585 are derived from the rcp scenarios while the ssp126 scenario represents an optimistic future aiming for sustainability the ssp245 is an intermediate scenario future with regard to goals of mitigation and adaptation gidden et al 2019 recently mishra et al 2020a developed a bias corrected dataset for daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures at 0 25 spatial resolution for south asia for historical 1951 2014 and future 2015 2100 climate using 13 cmip6 gcm models see table s1 for the list of gcms in this study we utilized the bias corrected cmip6 multi model ensemble daily rainfall dataset developed by mishra et al 2020a 2020b for future drought analysis drought characteristics of near future 2020 2049 and far future 2070 2099 periods corresponding to two moderate climate change scenarios ssp126 and ssp245 are compared with the baseline 1985 2014 period 3 methodology 3 1 data pre processing firstly the meteorological drought related variables monthly rainfall and number of rainy days in a month are extracted from the daily rainfall timeseries at each grid location in the study region the term rainy day refers to a day that has received total rainfall greater than or equal to 2 5 mm as per the imd criterion dash et al 2011 smitha et al 2018 in this study total rainfall and total rainy days data are prepared for 3 6 and 12 months scale drought index calculation for instance spi 3 and rpdi 3 time series correspond to 3 months scale suitable for short term drought monitoring using the rainfall data spi 3 spi 6 spi 12 rpdi 3 rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 timeseries are computed for analysis in this study 3 2 standardized precipitation index spi the meteorological drought index spi is computed using methodology proposed by mckee et al 1993 the gamma distribution is fitted to monthly rainfall time series and the cumulative distribution values using the gamma distribution are then transformed to obtain a standard normal distribution time series with mean as zero and standard deviation as one positive values indicate the absence of drought whereas negative spi values indicate drought events the classification of drought events suggested by mckee et al 1993 is provided in table 1 the spi is used to monitor both short term spi 3 and long term spi 6 spi 12 droughts 3 3 development of rainfall pattern drought index rpdi the spi is modified to develop the proposed rpdi by using two drought variables rainfall and the number of rainy days therefore a bivariate distribution of the two variables is used to estimate rpdi in the present study precipitation x 1 and number of rainy days x 2 are jointly modelled as continuous variables using a suitable bivariate copula c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 where f i x i is a univariate marginal distribution joe 1997 nelsen 2006 agnese et al 2014 in the past copulas have been used to combine different drought indicators to develop indices to monitor droughts kao and govindaraju 2010 hao and aghakouchak 2013 the copula based rpdi is given by eq 1 1 rpdi φ 1 c where φ 1 indicates the inverse standard normal distribution the copula function c is described briefly in section 3 4 the formulation in eq 1 produces a time series data in the same range as the spi 3 4 copula copulas have numerous applications in hydrometeorology and drought studies to combine hydroclimatic variables precipitation streamflow soil moisture among others to develop drought indices to perform multivariate drought monitoring kao and govindaraju 2010 hao and aghakouchak 2013 ramadas and govindaraju 2015 and for drought frequency analysis liu et al 2016 vergni et al 2020 xu et al 2021 among others according to sklar 1959 if h is the joint distribution of different univariate marginal distributions denoted by f i x i in a d dimensional space copula c is expressed such that for all x i in r as shown in equation 2 h x 1 x 2 x d c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f d x d 2 where h is the joint cumulative distribution function cdf of d univariate marginal distributions if f 1 x 1 u and f 2 x 2 v the copula probability distribution function c u v is given by equation 3 c u v 2 c u v u v 3 where c u v represents the copula and u v are the marginal cdfs of x 1 x 2 respectively the bivariate copula models that are adopted in this study are given in table 2 in the initial step the marginal cdfs of the drought variables rainfall and number of rainy days are obtained from different probability distributions the number of rainy days is assumed to be a continuous variable in this study considering the length of the dataset the number of rainy days is modelled using the non parametric kernel distribution and rainfall is modelled using the gamma distribution in this study copula parameter estimation is carried out using the maximum likelihood approach the best copula for rpdi calculation is selected on the basis of akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1973 goodness of fit criteria the aic value is computed using 2 k 2 ln l where k represents the number of parameters in the copula model and l is maximum likelihood attained for that function the lowest aic test statistic gives the best fit function among the copula models for a particular grid location the rpdi is calculated at different time scales 3 6 and 12 months using eq 1 adopting the same classification as that of spi to categorize droughts given in table 1 the lin s concordance correlation coefficient lin 1989 is used in this study for measuring the agreement between the drought indices spi and rpdi 3 5 changes in spatiotemporal variability of drought characteristics drought characteristics severity and duration defined using the runs theory are extracted from the spi and rpdi timeseries liu et al 2016 wu et al 2017 2018 the runs theory proposed by yevjevich 1967 suggests that a predefined threshold value could be used to indicate a drought event in this case a negative value of the index the duration of a negative run months having consecutive negative index values is then the drought duration the drought severity is the cumulative sum of negative values in that duration the schematic of runs theory along with drought severity and duration is provided in supplementary fig s1 drought monitoring using rpdi and spi are compared by analysing the spatiotemporal distribution of drought events and average drought severity over india in this study two historical time slices 1920 1960 and 1961 2000 are considered for assessing the temporal variability in drought characteristics the drought propensity number of events and average drought severity analysis are based on moderate and severe extreme category droughts at each location in the region additionally temporal trend analysis is performed using the sen s slope method sen 1968 to assess changes in severity of different duration drought events the proposed rpdi framework is then utilized to evaluate the changes in drought characteristics in india under potential climate change using the future period multi model ensemble cmip6 rainfall projections under ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios in this study rpdi drought characteristics severity duration and number of events in the baseline 1985 2014 near future 2020 2049 far future 2070 2099 periods are compared to assess the impacts of climate change on drought in india 4 results and discussion 4 1 drought monitoring using rpdi the goodness of fit of different copula models adopted in the study for computing rpdi 3 rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 time series are evaluated using aic the best copula obtained for each location and time scale are shown in supplementary fig s2 in the present study drought monitoring based on rpdi 3 rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 are compared with spi 3 spi 6 and spi 12 respectively for studying short term and long term drought characteristics the rpdi and spi timeseries estimated at a sample grid location loc 1 8 30 n 77 50e in the study region for the period 1970 2009 are shown in fig 1 the time series plots of the indices indicate the significant drought events that occurred in this period matching quite well with the major drought years such as 1982 1986 1987 2002 2004 and 2009 identified by the indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm pune based on the summer monsoon june to september rainfall data during the 1871 2015 period http www tropmet res in kolli mol monsoon historical air html drought years 1991 1996 2003 2004 and 2009 are among those that are classified as severe extreme drought years by rpdi 3 fig 1a rpdi 6 fig 1b and rpdi 12 fig 1c rpdi identified persistent extreme drought condition during the period 2002 2004 as have spi though good agreement is observed between rpdi and spi differences are evident in values of drought severity particularly when the total rainfall received are associated with relatively lesser number of rainy days it is seen that during 2000 2009 period fig 1 rpdi severity is greater than spi in multiple cases months while rpdi and spi indicated the onset of the drought events alike the demise of rpdi drought events is slightly delayed compared to that of spi indicating a different estimate of persistence of the droughts by the new index the differences between rpdi and spi are more pronounced in 12 month scale drought analysis fig 1c clearly long term drought assessment is performed better by the proposed index the lin s concordance correlation coefficient maps in fig 2 show the nature of agreement between the two drought monitoring indices at 3 6 and 12 months scales at different locations in india except for few locations in the west coast and northeast part of the country there seems to be good concordance our analysis indicated that the correlation between number of rainy days and rainfall is lower in the eastern and western part of india during the months of april may june july and august as shown in supplementary figs s3 s4 s5 in fact pal et al 2021 reported that the northeast and west coastline of india received largest number of rainy days owing to their mountainous landscape that provides an orographic block to the moisture loaded winds during the monsoon season june september similarly varikoden and revadekar 2020 observed a significant increase in heavy rainfall events replacing the low rainfall events in northeast part of the country therefore low correlations seen in maps in fig 2 are attributed to short duration intense rainfall and long duration light rainfall events and rpdi assigned different drought severity values to these events unlike spi the results of drought monitoring indicated that by incorporating the number of rainy days in rpdi framework we could detect anomalous patterns in rainfall events that cause droughts in this regard figs 3 and 4 highlight the rpdi s redefinition of spi assigned drought categories with the additional information on rainfall pattern the scatter plots of total rainfall versus number of rainy days used in 3 months scale drought analysis with corresponding drought categories are shown in fig 3 there are marked differences in drought categories assigned to months of april july and november by spi 3 and rpdi 3 in certain cases the months are categorized as moderate and mild droughts by spi see table 1 for definition of drought categories while rpdi assigned those to a more severe category specifically when the months have relatively lower number of rainy days moderate drought according to spi rpdi classified them as severe drought months there are also few instances when relatively higher rainfall is received in certain months and rpdi classified those to moderate drought category fig 3 the scatter plots of total rainfall versus number of rainy days with corresponding drought categories for the month of july at 3 6 and 12 months time scales are shown in fig 4 the events with a smaller number of rainy days that are identified as moderate drought and near normal categories by spi are identified as moderate and severe droughts respectively by rpdi that is the definition of a meteorological drought in rpdi based drought monitoring captures patterns in rainfall distribution it is important to perform local scale validation of the index using other drought indicators to evaluate its utility as an overall drought indicator for a study region the rpdi drought characterization is compared with selected vegetation and soil moisture indices to test its performance as an indicator of agricultural drought conditions henchiri et al 2020 vegetation condition based ndvi and vci and soil moisture based smci computed at different grid points in a test bed region in the state of odisha in eastern india are utilized for estimating pearson correlation coefficient between these indices and rpdi the correlations are computed for both rpdi and spi at 3 6 12 and 24 months scales and then the results at these grid points are aggregated as shown in box plots in fig 5 rpdi 3 is found to correlate with ndvi and vci relatively better than spi 3 however at longer times scales 12 and 24 months rpdi and spi exhibit similar correlations with vegetation based indices our results suggest that with smci spi at shorter time scales 3 and 6 months correlated better than rpdi correlations of rpdi 12 and spi 12 with smci are quite similar rpdi and spi at longer time scales have maximum positive correlations with smci when compared to vegetation based indices the box plots in fig 5 for the test bed region show that while rpdi 3 has the maximum positive correlations with the chosen vegetation based indices spi 3 and spi 6 has the strongest positive correlations with the chosen soil moisture based index indicating their suitability for agricultural drought monitoring while it is important to evaluate the performance of the proposed drought index with practical indicators of agricultural droughts such as yield loss and soil moisture deficit in the current study a detailed validation for the proposed drought index for the entire country is not carried out due to lack of continuous datasets of yield and observed soil moisture 4 2 spatiotemporal variability of drought characteristics the results of spatial analysis of average drought severity during 1920 1960 and 1961 2000 time periods performed at 3 and 6 months scales are shown in fig 6 average drought severity in the range of 2 to 3 5 is found for majority of locations in the study region when all the drought events are analysed fig 6a d as discussed before average drought severity suggested by rpdi 3 is higher 2 to 5 compared to spi 3 because of inclusion of number of rainy days the rpdi 3 and spi 3 drought severity maps show that spatial variability is captured better by rpdi 3 for instance the west side of india has been facing more serious droughts in both the periods considered in this study when compared to the northeast region parida and oinam 2015 locations in india experienced more severe drought events during the recent past as is ascertained by 10 drought years identified by the iitm pune during the 1961 2000 period when compared to the 1920 1960 period https www tropmet res in kolli mol monsoon historical air html the maps in fig 6e h considering severe extreme category drought events an event in which the magnitude of severity remains in severe category for the whole duration indicate there is no significant change in the average drought severity between the 1920 1960 and 1961 2000 periods fig 6i l show the spatial distribution of average drought severity based on the moderate category drought events an event in which the magnitude of severity remains in moderate state for the whole duration the spatial drought severity patterns of spi 3 and rpdi 3 are similar in both the cases significant increase in drought severity is observed in the north east and south parts of india during 1961 2000 period compared to the pre 1960 period indicating increased occurrence of severe drought events in the recent past fig 6g h these results agree with the historical trends reported in previous drought studies mallya et al 2016 thomas and prasannakumar 2016 mishra et al 2019 similar to fig 6 the maps in fig 7 plotted for rpdi 6 and spi 6 show that rpdi 6 average drought severity is higher than spi 6 and there is increase in severity at locations in the north east and south parts of india in the recent past fig 7g h k l average severity of moderate droughts estimated by rpdi 6 and spi 6 are similar and during 1961 2000 most of the locations experienced an increased severity compared to the 1920 1960 period fig 7i l increase in severity of severe extreme category droughts is seen across the study region in the 1961 2000 period with rpdi 6 drought severity greater than spi 6 fig 7e h results of spatiotemporal variability of total number of meteorological droughts are presented in maps in fig 8 the rpdi 3 has captured more drought events compared to spi 3 during both the time periods except in western part of india as seen in fig 8a d overall india experienced lesser number of moderate and severe rpdi 3 droughts during the 1961 2000 period fig 8e g i k fig 9 presents the results of analysis based on rpdi 6 and spi 6 drought events though no significant change is observed in the total number of droughts between the two time periods the hotspots based on the number of drought events are found to be distributed across india during the 1961 2000 period the number of rpdi 6 drought events reduced in both severe and moderate categories compared to 1920 1960 average drought severity and number of drought events maps for the historical periods using rpdi 12 and spi 12 are provided in the supplementary figs s6 and s7 respectively these findings emphasize the need to investigate the dynamic spatiotemporal patterns of drought events at local scale further the temporal trends in the characteristics of short term rpdi rpdi 3 droughts are examined using sen s slope estimator results of trend analysis of severity of different duration 1 2 3 and 4 months droughts presented in maps in fig 10 suggest no appreciable trend in severity of 1 2 and 3 months duration droughts during the 1920 1960 period in majority of locations in india fig 10a c however increasing as well as decreasing trends are seen at few locations in the western part of india in this period fig 10c overall india is observed to have increasing trend positive sen s slope in the severity of 4 month duration rpdi 3 droughts fig 10d significant positive trends in severity of 3 and 4 months duration droughts are similarly observed in the 1961 2000 period as shown in fig 10g h 4 3 future projections of drought characteristics 4 3 1 number of drought events the rpdi 3 rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 timeseries for the baseline 1985 2014 near future 2020 2049 far future 2070 2099 periods are computed to extract the drought characteristics total number of drought events maximum duration average duration maximum severity and average severity in order to examine the impacts of potential climate change the maps in fig 11 show the percentage change in the number of drought events in the future periods under ssp126 and ssp245 climate change scenarios similar to the historical periods figs 8 9 a decreasing trend in the number of rpdi droughts is observed at most of the locations in india in the northern part of india the number of rpdi 3 and rpdi 6 events are projected to have slight increase under ssp245 scenario in near future figs 11b f there is a projected 20 40 increase in rpdi 6 events in central and northeast part of the study region in far future under both the scenarios fig 11g h results also indicate that the eastern part of india is a likely hotspot under ssp126 scenario in both the future time periods while under ssp245 the central and northern parts of the country are affected the most by drought events 4 3 2 drought duration percentage change in the maximum drought duration in months is indicated by maps in fig 12 that suggest remarkable changes in duration in future periods due to climate change substantial increase is observed in maximum rpdi 3 rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 drought duration in northern india in near future fig 12a e i in the same period maximum rpdi 12 drought duration is likely to increase in india under ssp245 scenario fig 12j although maximum rpdi 3 and rpdi 6 drought durations are projected to decrease as seen in figs 12b and f the rpdi 3 rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 projections indicate a decrease in maximum drought duration over the central part of india in far future under potential climate change in other parts of india a projected increase of 20 80 in maximum drought duration in far future is obtained except for few locations where increase is greater than 100 similarly the maps in fig 13 show the projected changes in average drought duration in the future periods unlike the trends in maximum drought duration there is an overall decreasing trend in average drought duration about 10 30 decline in rpdi 3 average drought duration is observed in near future and far future under both the climate change scenarios as indicated by fig 13a d similar trend is projected in near future period for rpdi 6 average drought duration fig 13 e f however a 60 100 increase in rpdi 12 average drought duration is observed in future under both ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios as seen in fig 13i l 4 3 3 drought severity maximum drought severity is projected to increase significantly in india in the near future as suggested by the percentage change maps in fig 14 in general projected future trends of maximum drought severity and maximum drought duration are similar substantial increases in maximum rpdi 3 rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 drought severity are likely in near future under ssp126 scenario fig 14a e f the central and northern parts of india are projected to have a 10 50 decrease in drought severity in far future under both the scenarios however there is notable increase in severity over southern part of india as seen in fig 14i l the percentage change in average drought severity in the future periods are shown in maps in fig 15 and an overall negative trend is seen across india in near future under both climate change scenarios the projected changes in average drought severity are similar to average drought duration at majority of the locations the northwest part of india is likely to face escalation in long term rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 average drought severity in far future under ssp126 and ssp245 in the future periods as indicated by fig 15i l about 50 90 increase in rpdi 12 average drought severity is projected under both the scenarios numerous researchers have noted that droughts are likely to intensify and become more frequent in future in the study region due to natural and anthropogenic climate change bisht et al 2019 gupta et al 2020 zhai et al 2020 sharma and goyal 2020 shah and mishra 2020 amrit et al 2021 poonia et al 2021 choudhury et al 2021 santos et al 2021 saharwardi and kumar 2021 the presented results also support their findings on temporal changes in drought characteristics duration severity it is important to note that the results of our study are prone to model as well as scenario uncertainty since we performed a multi model ensemble based two climate change scenarios based analysis of future droughts uncertainty analysis studies along with use of different gcms projections and scenarios are recommended for comprehensive future drought analysis in the context of phenomenon of climate change similarly in addition to changes in rainfall pattern the projections of changes in evaporation demands may be studied for understanding the impacts of future droughts on crop growth and productivity bazrafshan 2017 nouri and homaee 2021 it is recommended to adopt a multivariate framework incorporating rpdi and popular agricultural drought indicators soil moisture evapotranspiration vegetation condition indices crop yield for assessing climate change impacts on agricultural droughts 5 conclusions in this study rpdi is proposed for meteorological drought studies based on the hypothesis that rainfall patterns need to be addressed in drought monitoring framework so that future prognosis of drought characteristics under changing climate can be analysed better our findings reveal that rpdi could resolve among drought events associated with different number of rainy days and assigned these events to different drought categories unlike indices such as spi hence its use is recommended for regions with significant spatiotemporal variability in rainfall and number of rainy days analyses of future drought characteristics under ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios using the cmip6 multi model ensemble rainfall projections indicate widespread increase in maximum drought duration and maximum drought severity decreases are also projected for average drought duration average drought severity and total number of drought events at numerous locations in india in particular the northwest eastern and south regions of india face likely intensification of drought risk in near future even under moderate climate change scenarios recognizing the role of changes in rainfall pattern as a potential precursor of hydro meteorological extremes such as droughts the proposed index could be a value addition to the existing drought monitoring approaches since agricultural activities in india are dependent on temporal distribution of rainfall as much as its magnitude the framework adopted in this study can help with various actions decisions pertaining to agricultural water resources management similarly at those locations where correlation between rpdi and crop growth stress indicators are relatively high rpdi can be also used as a proxy for monitoring agricultural droughts

9542,drought monitoring and understanding of spatiotemporal patterns of drought characteristics are beneficial for sustainable agricultural water management at a regional scale changes in rainfall and drought patterns in future could impact decision making in water resources allocation the impacts of potential climate change on future meteorological droughts could be better analysed by utilizing an index that incorporates the number of rainy days information in addition to magnitude of rainfall to characterize the drought severity in this study we propose a bivariate copula based multi scalar rainfall pattern drought index rpdi a variant of the popular standardized precipitation index spi and then the drought characteristics in india based on rpdi and spi at different time scales 3 6 and 12 months are analysed when compared to rpdi spi underestimated drought severity and indicated low spatial heterogeneity of drought characteristics the rpdi analysis identified changes in average drought severity and total number of drought events between two sample time slices 1920 1960 and 1961 2000 in the historical period future rpdi drought characteristics based on the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 multi model ensemble under two emission scenarios known as shared socioeconomic pathways ssps ssp126 and ssp245 are then computed when drought characteristics in the near future 2020 2049 and far future 2070 2099 periods are compared with their baseline period 1985 2014 values the results show that a significant declining trend is likely in the total number of drought events over the study region while increases are projected in the maximum drought duration and maximum drought severity in future long term drought characteristics extracted using 12 months scale rpdi are likely to intensify in future under both scenarios considering the effects of erratic rainfall pattern on agricultural productivity the rpdi drought monitoring framework could be utilized for efficient agricultural water management in future keywords rainfall pattern drought index copula climate change drought characteristics cmip6 ensemble data availability the gridded

availability have been known to affect agricultural productivity and economy of global communities more than any other hydrological extreme hao and aghakouchak 2013 ayanlade et al 2018 it is well known fact that the definition of drought event depends on the nature of water deficit existing in the study region heim 2002 droughts can be broadly classified into four types meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic droughts mishra and singh 2010 precipitation deficits that act as the driver of meteorological droughts can eventually cause agricultural hydrological and socio economic droughts the creeping nature of droughts compounded with their large scale impacts makes drought analysis quite complex and uncertain yet drought studies are vital for agricultural water management water resources planning natural hazard risk assessment and adaptation planning huang et al 2015 samantaray et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 han et al 2021 the focus of the present study is on meteorological drought monitoring based on rainfall pattern that is very likely to change in future owing to the phenomena of global warming and climate change though there are numerous meteorological drought indices available in the literature namely the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 among others these do not incorporate rainfall pattern to compute the drought severity by far the spi is most popular drought index among these indices owing to its simple framework multi scalar definition that enables monitoring of both short term and long term droughts and flexibility to compare across different locations thomas et al 2015 salvi and ghosh 2016 kalisa et al 2020 dai et al 2020 the spi is recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo as a standard index to complement the traditional drought monitoring approaches few limitations of spi such as i use of a fixed threshold for drought categorization without accounting for uncertainty mallya et al 2015 ramadas and govindaraju 2015 and ii poor performance in regions where precipitation is strongly seasonal and periodic chanda and maity 2015 are addressed by researchers in the recent times the standardized nonstationary precipitation index snspi russo et al 2013 and standardized precipitation anomaly index spai chanda and maity 2015 are available in literature as improved versions of spi and can be calculated for a variety of time scales 1 3 6 12 24 months additionally studies have combined multiple characteristics and types of droughts to develop different meteorological drought indices shah and mishra 2015 aadhar and mishra 2017 yet they have not addressed the rainfall pattern or temporal distribution of precipitation events in the context of studying droughts based on rainfall pattern murthy et al 2015 observed that drought monitoring based on rainfall and rainy days together as inputs identified more locations affected by droughts when compared to rainfall alone as the drought indicator their study pointed out that rainfall and rainy days based drought assessment are not correlated meaning considering one aspect alone could lead to inaccurate drought assessment drought hazard assessment using a composite index incorporating rainfall and rainy days statistics was performed by murthy et al 2017 that captured the spatiotemporal drought patterns over their study region singh et al 2021 proposed the standardized net precipitation distribution index snepi based on time distribution of net precipitation variable and compared its ability to capture rainfall pattern change with spei the number of rainy days has a significant impact on the food grain production and yield revadekar and preethi 2012 traore et al 2013 prasanna 2014 baffour ata et al 2021 for this reason it is recommended that the rainy days information be incorporated while quantifying meteorological droughts and further could add value to agricultural drought monitoring studies using popular indices based on vegetation condition indices soil moisture deficit and crop stress and crop yield in general light to moderate rain events act as soaking rain that replenish the soil moisture storage and resulting in relatively low runoff rates and streamflow trenberth et al 2003 extremely wet events that result in increased runoff yet unable to alleviate droughts have been common in recent decades along with prolonged dry spells zhou et al 2018 ajjur and riffi 2020 therefore in the context of drought definition a rainfall magnitude associated with fewer rainy days in a month would impact the stakeholders differently compared to a greater number of rainy days and changes in the rainfall pattern could influence the drought risk of a study region sun et al 2006 groisman and knight 2008 changes in rainfall pattern could be attributed to changes in topography natural climatic variability anthropogenic climate change and land use land cover changes and are of great relevance to the socio economic development of the region kharol et al 2013 herold et al 2016a 2016b few studies have utilized simple daily intensity index sdii or the mean precipitation in wet days to assess changes in rainfall pattern herold et al 2016a 2016b attogouinon et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 ajjur and riffi 2020 pohl et al 2017 assessed the impacts of climate change on the rainfall extreme events over southern africa and projected an increase in extreme rainfall intensity and a decrease in the number of rainy days in the future periods the recent studies suggest that drought risk assessment can no longer assume that climate is stationary milly et al 2008 zhai et al 2020 samantaray et al 2021 xu et al 2021 therefore drastic changes in the pattern and intensity of rainfall need to be addressed in drought risk analysis even if the total rainfall does not present any temporal trend attogouinon et al 2017 trenberth and zhang 2018 hence concurrent analyses of rainfall rainy days and meteorological droughts are crucial for modelling rainfall characteristics and drought events pathak and dodamani 2020 the effect of temporal distribution of total rainfall in a month on the severity of a dry wet condition at a location is a knowledge gap in existing drought monitoring that needs to be addressed groisman and knight 2008 mishra and liu 2014 singh et al 2021 therefore a new meteorological drought index called rainfall pattern drought index rpdi is discussed in this study wherein a given rainfall magnitude occurring with different patterns are considered as dry wet events with different severities and impacts the novel rpdi framework can address changes in rainfall pattern while quantifying drought characteristics in future under potential climate change the objectives of the present study are i to develop rpdi for meteorological drought monitoring as a variant of spi with incorporation of rainy days information and ii to assess the spatiotemporal variability of drought characteristics in future periods using global climate model based rainfall projections 2 data the development of rpdi is performed over india which is an agriculture dominated economy and vulnerable to drought extremes and associated losses in crop productivity kharol et al 2013 das et al 2014 mallya et al 2016 india receives about 80 of its annual rainfall during the june to september period and is termed as the all india summer monsoon rainfall aismr severe droughts are known to account for about two to five percent of gross domestic product gdp loss annually in india gadgil and gadgil 2006 and being a rain fed agricultural country meteorological droughts impact its rural population in many ways studies also suggest that a decreasing trend of rainfall compounded with decline in number of rainy days may exacerbate droughts in water stressed regions of the country kumar and jain 2011 das et al 2014 mishra and liu 2014 these findings emphasize the need to characterize meteorological droughts in india based on rainfall patterns in the present study gridded daily rainfall data for india obtained from the india meteorological department imd at spatial resolution 0 25 is used as observed rainfall for the estimation of rpdi this high resolution dataset prepared by pai et al 2014 using the observed rainfall measurements from 6955 rain gauge stations in india with varying availability period from 1901 to 2013 is popularly adopted for meteorological drought studies the dataset for the 1920 2000 period is used for index development in this study the drought events in two historical time slices 1920 1960 and 1961 2000 are analysed for comparing spatiotemporal variability of rpdi and spi based drought characteristics additionally for validating the performance of the index as an agricultural drought indicator gridded soil moisture data from national aeronautics and space administration nasa global land data assimilation system version 2 or gldas 2 gldas noah10 m v2 1 beaudoing and rodell nasa gsfc hsl 2020 rodell et al 2004 and satellite monitored surface reflectance data from the modis terra surface reflectance mod09ga version 6 vermote and wolfe 2015 models are used monthly time series

popular indicators used in agricultural drought studies for monitoring vegetation health and stress cai and sharma 2010 garcía león et al 2019 in this study for future drought analysis the coupled multi model inter comparison project version 6 cmip6 general circulation model gcm outputs are used the phase 6 model simulations are considered more robust than previous phases and have been used for studying droughts in south asia and india zhai et al 2020 shrestha et al 2020 gusain et al 2020 the climate change scenarios in cmip6 are termed as shared socioeconomic pathways ssps that project a certain magnitude of radiative forcing in watt m2 at the end of 21st century similar to representative concentration pathways rcps in cmip phase 5 among the cmip6 ssp scenarios ssp126 ssp245 ssp460 and ssp585 are derived from the rcp scenarios while the ssp126 scenario represents an optimistic future aiming for sustainability the ssp245 is an intermediate scenario future with regard to goals of mitigation and adaptation gidden et al 2019 recently mishra et al 2020a developed a bias corrected dataset for daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures at 0 25 spatial resolution for south asia for historical 1951 2014 and future 2015 2100 climate using 13 cmip6 gcm models see table s1 for the list of gcms in this study we utilized the bias corrected cmip6 multi model ensemble daily rainfall dataset developed by mishra et al 2020a 2020b for future drought analysis drought characteristics of near future 2020 2049 and far future 2070 2099 periods corresponding to two moderate climate change scenarios ssp126 and ssp245 are compared with the baseline 1985 2014 period 3 methodology 3 1 data pre processing firstly the meteorological drought related variables monthly rainfall and number of rainy days in a month are extracted from the daily rainfall timeseries at each grid location in the study region the term rainy day refers to a day that has received total rainfall greater than or equal to 2 5 mm as per the imd criterion dash et al 2011 smitha et al 2018 in this study total rainfall and total rainy days data are prepared for 3 6 and 12 months scale drought index calculation for instance spi 3 and rpdi 3 time series correspond to 3 months scale suitable for short term drought monitoring using the rainfall data spi 3 spi 6 spi 12 rpdi 3 rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 timeseries are computed for analysis in this study 3 2 standardized precipitation index spi the meteorological drought index spi is computed using methodology proposed by mckee et al 1993 the gamma distribution is fitted to monthly rainfall time series and the cumulative distribution values using the gamma distribution are then transformed to obtain a standard normal distribution time series with mean as zero and standard deviation as one positive values indicate the absence of drought whereas negative spi values indicate drought events the classification of drought events suggested by mckee et al 1993 is provided in table 1 the spi is used to monitor both short term spi 3 and long term spi 6 spi 12 droughts 3 3 development of rainfall pattern drought index rpdi the spi is modified to develop the proposed rpdi by using two drought variables rainfall and the number of rainy days therefore a bivariate distribution of the two variables is used to estimate rpdi in the present study precipitation x 1 and number of rainy days x 2 are jointly modelled as continuous variables using a suitable bivariate copula c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 where f i x i is a univariate marginal distribution joe 1997 nelsen 2006 agnese et al 2014 in the past copulas have been used to combine different drought indicators to develop indices to monitor droughts kao and govindaraju 2010 hao and aghakouchak 2013 the copula based rpdi is given by eq 1 1 rpdi φ 1 c where φ 1 indicates the inverse standard normal distribution the copula function c is described briefly in section 3 4 the formulation in eq 1 produces a time series data in the same range as the spi 3 4 copula copulas have numerous applications in hydrometeorology and drought studies to combine hydroclimatic variables precipitation streamflow soil moisture among others to develop drought indices to perform multivariate drought monitoring kao and govindaraju 2010 hao and aghakouchak 2013 ramadas and govindaraju 2015 and for drought frequency analysis liu et al 2016 vergni et al 2020 xu et al 2021 among others according to sklar 1959 if h is the joint distribution of different univariate marginal distributions denoted by f i x i in a d dimensional space copula c is expressed such that for all x i in r as shown in equation 2 h x 1 x 2 x d c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f d x d 2 where h is the joint cumulative distribution function cdf of d univariate marginal distributions if f 1 x 1 u and f 2 x 2 v the copula probability distribution function c u v is given by equation 3 c u v 2 c u v u v 3 where c u v represents the copula and u v are the marginal cdfs of x 1 x 2 respectively the bivariate copula models that are adopted in this study are given in table 2 in the initial step the marginal cdfs of the drought variables rainfall and number of rainy days are obtained from different probability distributions the number of rainy days is assumed to be a continuous variable in this study considering the length of the dataset the number of rainy days is modelled using the non parametric kernel distribution and rainfall is modelled using the gamma distribution in this study copula parameter estimation is carried out using the maximum likelihood approach the best copula for rpdi calculation is selected on the basis of akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1973 goodness of fit criteria the aic value is computed using 2 k 2 ln l where k represents the number of parameters in the copula model and l is maximum likelihood attained for that function the lowest aic test statistic gives the best fit function among the copula models for a particular grid location the rpdi is calculated at different time scales 3 6 and 12 months using eq 1 adopting the same classification as that of spi to categorize droughts given in table 1 the lin s concordance correlation coefficient lin 1989 is used in this study for measuring the agreement between the drought indices spi and rpdi 3 5 changes in spatiotemporal variability of drought characteristics drought characteristics severity and duration defined using the runs theory are extracted from the spi and rpdi timeseries liu et al 2016 wu et al 2017 2018 the runs theory proposed by yevjevich 1967 suggests that a predefined threshold value could be used to indicate a drought event in this case a negative value of the index the duration of a negative run months having consecutive negative index values is then the drought duration the drought severity is the cumulative sum of negative values in that duration the schematic of runs theory along with drought severity and duration is provided in supplementary fig s1 drought monitoring using rpdi and spi are compared by analysing the spatiotemporal distribution of drought events and average drought severity over india in this study two historical time slices 1920 1960 and 1961 2000 are considered for assessing the temporal variability in drought characteristics the drought propensity number of events and average drought severity analysis are based on moderate and severe extreme category droughts at each location in the region additionally temporal trend analysis is performed using the sen s slope method sen 1968 to assess changes in severity of different duration drought events the proposed rpdi framework is then utilized to evaluate the changes in drought characteristics in india under potential climate change using the future period multi model ensemble cmip6 rainfall projections under ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios in this study rpdi drought characteristics severity duration and number of events in the baseline 1985 2014 near future 2020 2049 far future 2070 2099 periods are compared to assess the impacts of climate change on drought in india 4 results and discussion 4 1 drought monitoring using rpdi the goodness of fit of different copula models adopted in the study for computing rpdi 3 rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 time series are evaluated using aic the best copula obtained for each location and time scale are shown in supplementary fig s2 in the present study drought monitoring based on rpdi 3 rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 are compared with spi 3 spi 6 and spi 12 respectively for studying short term and long term drought characteristics the rpdi and spi timeseries estimated at a sample grid location loc 1 8 30 n 77 50e in the study region for the period 1970 2009 are shown in fig 1 the time series plots of the indices indicate the significant drought events that occurred in this period matching quite well with the major drought years such as 1982 1986 1987 2002 2004 and 2009 identified by the indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm pune based on the summer monsoon june to september rainfall data during the 1871 2015 period http www tropmet res in kolli mol monsoon historical air html drought years 1991 1996 2003 2004 and 2009 are among those that are classified as severe extreme drought years by rpdi 3 fig 1a rpdi 6 fig 1b and rpdi 12 fig 1c rpdi identified persistent extreme drought condition during the period 2002 2004 as have spi though good agreement is observed between rpdi and spi differences are evident in values of drought severity particularly when the total rainfall received are associated with relatively lesser number of rainy days it is seen that during 2000 2009 period fig 1 rpdi severity is greater than spi in multiple cases months while rpdi and spi indicated the onset of the drought events alike the demise of rpdi drought events is slightly delayed compared to that of spi indicating a different estimate of persistence of the droughts by the new index the differences between rpdi and spi are more pronounced in 12 month scale drought analysis fig 1c clearly long term drought assessment is performed better by the proposed index the lin s concordance correlation coefficient maps in fig 2 show the nature of agreement between the two drought monitoring indices at 3 6 and 12 months scales at different locations in india except for few locations in the west coast and northeast part of the country there seems to be good concordance our analysis indicated that the correlation between number of rainy days and rainfall is lower in the eastern and western part of india during the months of april may june july and august as shown in supplementary figs s3 s4 s5 in fact pal et al 2021 reported that the northeast and west coastline of india received largest number of rainy days owing to their mountainous landscape that provides an orographic block to the moisture loaded winds during the monsoon season june september similarly varikoden and revadekar 2020 observed a significant increase in heavy rainfall events replacing the low rainfall events in northeast part of the country therefore low correlations seen in maps in fig 2 are attributed to short duration intense rainfall and long duration light rainfall events and rpdi assigned different drought severity values to these events unlike spi the results of drought monitoring indicated that by incorporating the number of rainy days in rpdi framework we could detect anomalous patterns in rainfall events that cause droughts in this regard figs 3 and 4 highlight the rpdi s redefinition of spi assigned drought categories with the additional information on rainfall pattern the scatter plots of total rainfall versus number of rainy days used in 3 months scale drought analysis with corresponding drought categories are shown in fig 3 there are marked differences in drought categories assigned to months of april july and november by spi 3 and rpdi 3 in certain cases the months are categorized as moderate and mild droughts by spi see table 1 for definition of drought categories while rpdi assigned those to a more severe category specifically when the months have relatively lower number of rainy days moderate drought according to spi rpdi classified them as severe drought months there are also few instances when relatively higher rainfall is received in certain months and rpdi classified those to moderate drought category fig 3 the scatter plots of total rainfall versus number of rainy days with corresponding drought categories for the month of july at 3 6 and 12 months time scales are shown in fig 4 the events with a smaller number of rainy days that are identified as moderate drought and near normal categories by spi are identified as moderate and severe droughts respectively by rpdi that is the definition of a meteorological drought in rpdi based drought monitoring captures patterns in rainfall distribution it is important to perform local scale validation of the index using other drought indicators to evaluate its utility as an overall drought indicator for a study region the rpdi drought characterization is compared with selected vegetation and soil moisture indices to test its performance as an indicator of agricultural drought conditions henchiri et al 2020 vegetation condition based ndvi and vci and soil moisture based smci computed at different grid points in a test bed region in the state of odisha in eastern india are utilized for estimating pearson correlation coefficient between these indices and rpdi the correlations are computed for both rpdi and spi at 3 6 12 and 24 months scales and then the results at these grid points are aggregated as shown in box plots in fig 5 rpdi 3 is found to correlate with ndvi and vci relatively better than spi 3 however at longer times scales 12 and 24 months rpdi and spi exhibit similar correlations with vegetation based indices our results suggest that with smci spi at shorter time scales 3 and 6 months correlated better than rpdi correlations of rpdi 12 and spi 12 with smci are quite similar rpdi and spi at longer time scales have maximum positive correlations with smci when compared to vegetation based indices the box plots in fig 5 for the test bed region show that while rpdi 3 has the maximum positive correlations with the chosen vegetation based indices spi 3 and spi 6 has the strongest positive correlations with the chosen soil moisture based index indicating their suitability for agricultural drought monitoring while it is important to evaluate the performance of the proposed drought index with practical indicators of agricultural droughts such as yield loss and soil moisture deficit in the current study a detailed validation for the proposed drought index for the entire country is not carried out due to lack of continuous datasets of yield and observed soil moisture 4 2 spatiotemporal variability of drought characteristics the results of spatial analysis of average drought severity during 1920 1960 and 1961 2000 time periods performed at 3 and 6 months scales are shown in fig 6 average drought severity in the range of 2 to 3 5 is found for majority of locations in the study region when all the drought events are analysed fig 6a d as discussed before average drought severity suggested by rpdi 3 is higher 2 to 5 compared to spi 3 because of inclusion of number of rainy days the rpdi 3 and spi 3 drought severity maps show that spatial variability is captured better by rpdi 3 for instance the west side of india has been facing more serious droughts in both the periods considered in this study when compared to the northeast region parida and oinam 2015 locations in india experienced more severe drought events during the recent past as is ascertained by 10 drought years identified by the iitm pune during the 1961 2000 period when compared to the 1920 1960 period https www tropmet res in kolli mol monsoon historical air html the maps in fig 6e h considering severe extreme category drought events an event in which the magnitude of severity remains in severe category for the whole duration indicate there is no significant change in the average drought severity between the 1920 1960 and 1961 2000 periods fig 6i l show the spatial distribution of average drought severity based on the moderate category drought events an event in which the magnitude of severity remains in moderate state for the whole duration the spatial drought severity patterns of spi 3 and rpdi 3 are similar in both the cases significant increase in drought severity is observed in the north east and south parts of india during 1961 2000 period compared to the pre 1960 period indicating increased occurrence of severe drought events in the recent past fig 6g h these results agree with the historical trends reported in previous drought studies mallya et al 2016 thomas and prasannakumar 2016 mishra et al 2019 similar to fig 6 the maps in fig 7 plotted for rpdi 6 and spi 6 show that rpdi 6 average drought severity is higher than spi 6 and there is increase in severity at locations in the north east and south parts of india in the recent past fig 7g h k l average severity of moderate droughts estimated by rpdi 6 and spi 6 are similar and during 1961 2000 most of the locations experienced an increased severity compared to the 1920 1960 period fig 7i l increase in severity of severe extreme category droughts is seen across the study region in the 1961 2000 period with rpdi 6 drought severity greater than spi 6 fig 7e h results of spatiotemporal variability of total number of meteorological droughts are presented in maps in fig 8 the rpdi 3 has captured more drought events compared to spi 3 during both the time periods except in western part of india as seen in fig 8a d overall india experienced lesser number of moderate and severe rpdi 3 droughts during the 1961 2000 period fig 8e g i k fig 9 presents the results of analysis based on rpdi 6 and spi 6 drought events though no significant change is observed in the total number of droughts between the two time periods the hotspots based on the number of drought events are found to be distributed across india during the 1961 2000 period the number of rpdi 6 drought events reduced in both severe and moderate categories compared to 1920 1960 average drought severity and number of drought events maps for the historical periods using rpdi 12 and spi 12 are provided in the supplementary figs s6 and s7 respectively these findings emphasize the need to investigate the dynamic spatiotemporal patterns of drought events at local scale further the temporal trends in the characteristics of short term rpdi rpdi 3 droughts are examined using sen s slope estimator results of trend analysis of severity of different duration 1 2 3 and 4 months droughts presented in maps in fig 10 suggest no appreciable trend in severity of 1 2 and 3 months duration droughts during the 1920 1960 period in majority of locations in india fig 10a c however increasing as well as decreasing trends are seen at few locations in the western part of india in this period fig 10c overall india is observed to have increasing trend positive sen s slope in the severity of 4 month duration rpdi 3 droughts fig 10d significant positive trends in severity of 3 and 4 months duration droughts are similarly observed in the 1961 2000 period as shown in fig 10g h 4 3 future projections of drought characteristics 4 3 1 number of drought events the rpdi 3 rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 timeseries for the baseline 1985 2014 near future 2020 2049 far future 2070 2099 periods are computed to extract the drought characteristics total number of drought events maximum duration average duration maximum severity and average severity in order to examine the impacts of potential climate change the maps in fig 11 show the percentage change in the number of drought events in the future periods under ssp126 and ssp245 climate change scenarios similar to the historical periods figs 8 9 a decreasing trend in the number of rpdi droughts is observed at most of the locations in india in the northern part of india the number of rpdi 3 and rpdi 6 events are projected to have slight increase under ssp245 scenario in near future figs 11b f there is a projected 20 40 increase in rpdi 6 events in central and northeast part of the study region in far future under both the scenarios fig 11g h results also indicate that the eastern part of india is a likely hotspot under ssp126 scenario in both the future time periods while under ssp245 the central and northern parts of the country are affected the most by drought events 4 3 2 drought duration percentage change in the maximum drought duration in months is indicated by maps in fig 12 that suggest remarkable changes in duration in future periods due to climate change substantial increase is observed in maximum rpdi 3 rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 drought duration in northern india in near future fig 12a e i in the same period maximum rpdi 12 drought duration is likely to increase in india under ssp245 scenario fig 12j although maximum rpdi 3 and rpdi 6 drought durations are projected to decrease as seen in figs 12b and f the rpdi 3 rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 projections indicate a decrease in maximum drought duration over the central part of india in far future under potential climate change in other parts of india a projected increase of 20 80 in maximum drought duration in far future is obtained except for few locations where increase is greater than 100 similarly the maps in fig 13 show the projected changes in average drought duration in the future periods unlike the trends in maximum drought duration there is an overall decreasing trend in average drought duration about 10 30 decline in rpdi 3 average drought duration is observed in near future and far future under both the climate change scenarios as indicated by fig 13a d similar trend is projected in near future period for rpdi 6 average drought duration fig 13 e f however a 60 100 increase in rpdi 12 average drought duration is observed in future under both ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios as seen in fig 13i l 4 3 3 drought severity maximum drought severity is projected to increase significantly in india in the near future as suggested by the percentage change maps in fig 14 in general projected future trends of maximum drought severity and maximum drought duration are similar substantial increases in maximum rpdi 3 rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 drought severity are likely in near future under ssp126 scenario fig 14a e f the central and northern parts of india are projected to have a 10 50 decrease in drought severity in far future under both the scenarios however there is notable increase in severity over southern part of india as seen in fig 14i l the percentage change in average drought severity in the future periods are shown in maps in fig 15 and an overall negative trend is seen across india in near future under both climate change scenarios the projected changes in average drought severity are similar to average drought duration at majority of the locations the northwest part of india is likely to face escalation in long term rpdi 6 and rpdi 12 average drought severity in far future under ssp126 and ssp245 in the future periods as indicated by fig 15i l about 50 90 increase in rpdi 12 average drought severity is projected under both the scenarios numerous researchers have noted that droughts are likely to intensify and become more frequent in future in the study region due to natural and anthropogenic climate change bisht et al 2019 gupta et al 2020 zhai et al 2020 sharma and goyal 2020 shah and mishra 2020 amrit et al 2021 poonia et al 2021 choudhury et al 2021 santos et al 2021 saharwardi and kumar 2021 the presented results also support their findings on temporal changes in drought characteristics duration severity it is important to note that the results of our study are prone to model as well as scenario uncertainty since we performed a multi model ensemble based two climate change scenarios based analysis of future droughts uncertainty analysis studies along with use of different gcms projections and scenarios are recommended for comprehensive future drought analysis in the context of phenomenon of climate change similarly in addition to changes in rainfall pattern the projections of changes in evaporation demands may be studied for understanding the impacts of future droughts on crop growth and productivity bazrafshan 2017 nouri and homaee 2021 it is recommended to adopt a multivariate framework incorporating rpdi and popular agricultural drought indicators soil moisture evapotranspiration vegetation condition indices crop yield for assessing climate change impacts on agricultural droughts 5 conclusions in this study rpdi is proposed for meteorological drought studies based on the hypothesis that rainfall patterns need to be addressed in drought monitoring framework so that future prognosis of drought characteristics under changing climate can be analysed better our findings reveal that rpdi could resolve among drought events associated with different number of rainy days and assigned these events to different drought categories unlike indices such as spi hence its use is recommended for regions with significant spatiotemporal variability in rainfall and number of rainy days analyses of future drought characteristics under ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios using the cmip6 multi model ensemble rainfall projections indicate widespread increase in maximum drought duration and maximum drought severity decreases are also projected for average drought duration average drought severity and total number of drought events at numerous locations in india in particular the northwest eastern and south regions of india face likely intensification of drought risk in near future even under moderate climate change scenarios recognizing the role of changes in rainfall pattern as a potential precursor of hydro meteorological extremes such as droughts the proposed index could be a value addition to the existing drought monitoring approaches since agricultural activities in india are dependent on temporal distribution of rainfall as much as its magnitude the framework adopted in this study can help with various actions decisions pertaining to agricultural water resources management similarly at those locations where correlation between rpdi and crop growth stress indicators are relatively high rpdi can be also used as a proxy for monitoring agricultural droughts

9543,vicious competition for limited water resources hinders the synergetic and sustainable development of central asian countries which further threatens food security and exacerbates ecological degradation in this study a copula based bi level decentralized programming cbdp method is developed and applied to planning water food ecology wfe nexus system cbdp has advantages in balancing tradeoffs between different decision levels analyzing synergies among multiple managers and reflecting joint risks of interrelated uncertain parameters then a cbdp wfe model is formulated for central asia where the upper level model aims to maximize system benefit for the region i e regional scale and the lower level model involves five objectives to maximize five countries benefits i e national scale respectively totally 108 scenarios are designed to analyze the impacts of joint constraint violation risk agricultural irrigation efficiency and ecological water demand results reveal that i improving agricultural irrigation efficiency can optimize the water allocation pattern as well as increase the system benefit ii in order to restore the regional eco environment the proportion of ecological water allocation should increase from 7 of the current level to 14 9 23 8 by 2050 iii water allocations to uzbekistan and tajikistan should be properly controlled especially when available water is scarce the results are helpful for managers in not only making decisions of water allocation among multiple users and countries but also gaining insight into synergetic management of wfe nexus under various system conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords bi level decentralized programming central asia copula synergetic management uncertainty water food ecology nexus 1 introduction with accelerated population increase rapid economic development and subversive consumption pattern change the problems of water scarcity food crisis and ecological degradation have become increasingly prominent in detail nearly 4 billion people face severe water shortage for at least one month per year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 around 52 of the world s population will live in water scarce areas by 2050 kölbel et al 2018 as the largest user of water agriculture accounts for 69 of global water withdrawals the growing food demand and expanding arable land exacerbate water scarcity however despite the tremendous efforts made by many countries for food security about 821 million people worldwide accounting for 11 of the total population still face severe malnutrition unesco and un water 2020 in addition degrading water resources and expanding agricultural land have led to extremely unfavorable ecological changes in some regions such as drying up of lakes extinction of native fish and outbreak of sandstorms salt storms thus the deteriorating ecosystem has to compete with the agricultural sector for limited water resources in general there is complex interweaving relationship among water food and ecology which forms the water food ecology wfe nexus system in order to alleviate water scarcity food crisis and ecological degradation it is necessary for decision makers to make synergetic management of wfe nexus system the wfe nexus system often involves multiple stakeholders with conflicting preferences and objectives e g economic development and ecological restoration which amplifies the complexity of synergetic management bi level programming bp is an effective method in balancing the conflict between different stakeholders and has been applied to tackle hierarchical decision making problems bostian et al 2015 zhang and vesselinov 2016 jin et al 2018 saeidi mobarakeh et al 2020 for example ma et al 2020 developed an interval stochastic bi level programming method to plan water energy nexus system in the city level where the targets of maximizing system benefit and minimizing energy consumption during water allocation can be optimized simultaneously yue et al 2020 proposed a type 2 fuzzy integer bi level programming method to distribute water resources for zhanghe irrigation district china in which the tradeoff between system benefit and agricultural profit was effectively balanced in general bp has advantages in resolving conflicts between two level decision makers in hierarchical structure in the real world wfe nexus system multiple stakeholders may have cooperative and interactive relationships the decision of one stakeholder has a profound impact on others making the process of synergetic management more complicated the conventional bp method has limitation in reflecting the interactions among multiple stakeholders bi level decentralized programming bdp with one decision center at the upper level and multiple stakeholders at the lower level can effectively make tradeoffs between different decision levels and reflect the synergies among multiple stakeholders ma et al 2021 in bdp the followers at lower level have their own objectives and can work cooperatively or uncooperatively through sharing variables thus the decisions of upper level can be influenced not only by the reactions of lower level individuals but also by the synergetic relationships among these individuals baky 2009 zhang and li 2010 however for the wfe nexus system affected by natural process and human induced imprecision some parameters and their interactions are characterized by random uncertainty which could bring great challenge to managers and reduce the reliability of management strategies hu et al 2021 mei et al 2021 for instance under the influence of precipitation evaporation and climate change the amount of available water for different sources cannot be measured by certain parameters but presented as various probability distribution functions surrounding the actual water flow li et al 2014 yue and guo 2021 copula based stochastic programming csp can fill above mentioned gap by estimating joint probability function with different marginals liu et al 2020 for example alizadeh et al 2018 developed a copula based stochastic hydro economic model to design irrigation system in iran where the joint risks of violating reservoir yield constraint were reflected shu et al 2019 proposed copula based interval bistochastic programming method to plan regional water allocation for zhanghe irrigation district china and analyzed the joint probability distribution of different hydrological variables zhang et al 2021 developed copula based stochastic fractional programming to optimize water food energy nexus system for aral sea basin in which the joint risks caused by random available sources e g water land and electricity were handled in general csp has advantage in tackling the random uncertain parameters with different probability distributions and unknown interrelationships typically the wfe nexus system of central asia has the characteristics of multi user multi component multi objective and multi uncertainty which further intensifies the competition for water resources and enlarges the complexity of the system however no previous study was reported on coupling csp with bdp for wfe nexus system of central asia therefore a copula based bi level decentralized programming cbdp method will be developed and applied for planning wfe nexus system of central asia cbdp will possess advantages in i balancing the tradeoffs between conflicting objectives in a hierarchical order ii reflecting synergies among multiple stakeholders which set in the same decision level iii tackling random uncertainty and analyzing joint constraint violation risk then a cbdp wfe model will be formulated for the wfe nexus system of central asia that involves two level decision makers with multiple stakeholders where the upper level objective corresponds to the entire region and the lower level objectives are associated with five countries totally 108 scenarios with different irrigation efficiency levels ecological water demand levels and joint constraint violation risks are analyzed results will help to i balance the contradiction between regional i e central asia and national i e five countries economic development ii reflect the interactive relationships among multiple countries in water allocation agricultural cultivation and ecological restoration iii disclose the influence of joint constraint violation risks on the synergetic management of wfe nexus system under various scenarios iv alleviate the competition for water resources among multiple stakeholders five countries upstream and downstream water users v identify the optimal water allocation scheme for multiple counties states users to ensure food security and ecological restoration the organization of this paper can be summarized as section 1 is the introduction which shows the motivation literature review innovation and contribution of this study section 2 presents the development of the cbdp method section 3 shows the formulation and application of cbdp wfe model in section 4 the major findings and the results related to water resources planting area and system benefit are discussed section 5 is the conclusion which summarized the innovation and main findings of this study 2 methodology bi level decentralized programming bdp with one decision center and multiple stakeholders is developed based on stackelberg games arora and gupta 2009 assuming x k1j and y ksj are vectors of decision variables controlled by upper and lower level planners respectively and f u and f ls are bounded performance functions for two level planners let s 1 represent decision center and s 2 3 s represents multiple stakeholders at the lower level the bdp method can be defined as 1a

are constant matrices although bdp can balance the tradeoff between two levels and reflect synergies among multiple divisions it cannot tackle random uncertainty caused by natural changes e g climate change and precipitation and human induced activity moeini and soltani nezhad 2020 besides the joint random uncertainty would exist in real world planning problem since the interaction of random parameters with various probability distributions for example with the impacts of glacial meltwater precipitation and co exploitation the available water resources for different sources have the characteristic of interrelated random uncertainty which increases the complexity of synergetic management conventional stochastic optimization methods such as chance constraint programming can only tackle univariate random parameter through its probability distribution and has limitation in tackling joint random uncertainty copula is an effective tool to analyze the relationships among multivariate parameters yang et al 2020 sun et al 2021 according to frees and valdez 1998 assuming u1 u2 up are random variables u 1 u 2 u p are corresponding realization and the joint distribution function of random variables can be obtained through 2 c u 1 u 2 u p prob u 1 u 1 u 2 u 2 u p u p where c is a copula function based on the marginal distribution functions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f p x p for

algorithm the upper level decision maker specifies his her preferred decision variable and leave some leeway which is modeled by membership function based on fuzzy set theory the multiple stakeholders at lower level should optimize their objectives separately then the obtained lower level solutions would be submitted and revised by upper level decision maker based on specified tolerance if the upper level decision maker is satisfied with the solution the global satisfactory solution would be obtained otherwise the upper level decision maker would change tolerances and repeats the process until the global satisfactory solution is reached in general the basic idea for the method is that two level decision makers maker compromises to find the global satisfactory solution in detail two level decision makers should solve their objectives individually assuming f u f u x k 1 j y k s j is optimal solution for upper level objective while f l s f l s x k s j y k s j are optimal solutions for lower level multiple objectives if the solution f u f u x k 1 j y k s j is equal to f l s f l s x k s j y k s j the global satisfactory solution would be same with f u f l s however since the conflicting characteristic between two level objective it is impractical or impossible for lower level decision makers to find the optimal solutions in such strict conditions thus as the decision center upper level decision maker should leave room or tolerance for the decision variable that lower level decision makers can search their optimal solution in a wider feasible domain therefore the upper level decision variable x k 1 j y k s j is allowed to fluctuate with the range of x k 1 j x k 1 j p x x k 1 j p x y k s j y k s j p y y k s j p y where p x and p y are tolerance values decided by upper level decision maker assuming i is column vector which has same dimension as decision variable λ is satisfactory degree parameter which ranges from 0 to 1 μ x k 1 j x k 1 j is the membership function for upper level decision variable the satisfaction for decision maker increases within the range of x k 1 j p x 0 and decreases within the range of 0 x k 1 j p x since the upper level objective is a maximize problem the upper level decision maker would accept the solution which satisfied f u f u and reject the solution which satisfied f u f u x k s j y k s j the preference within the range of f u f u would be linearly increasing thus the membership function for upper level objective can be formulated as μ u f u x k 1 j y k s j similarly the membership functions for multiple lower level objectives are μ l s f l s x k s j y k s j where s represents multiple stakeholders in the lower level then the global optimal solution for cbdp i e f u o p t f l s o p t and x k s j o p t

tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan and forty three states with an area of 4003 4 103 km2 and a population of 66 4 106 most of central asia is located in the arid zone and water resources are critical important for its economic development however central asia faces a number of problems such as water shortage food insecurity and ecological degradation in detail i excessive water consumption for agriculture under the soviet regime central asia vigorously expanded arable land and irrigated desert or steppe to produce cotton leading to excessive consumption of agricultural water accounting for 85 of total water withdrawal in addition the irrigation mainly relied on flood thus the low irrigation efficiency intensified water demand to satisfy large amount of water demand for agriculture more than 80 reservoirs were built each with a capacity of at least 10 million m3 which caused over exploitation of water resources world bank 2003 ii eco environment deterioration water shortage led to a reduction in ecological water distribution causing the extinction of native fish the outbreak of sandstorms salt storms and the degradation of delta biomes in recent decades the swamps and wetlands almost disappeared from 550 103 ha in the 1960 s to 20 103 ha in the 1990s more than 50 lakes with 60 103 ha of surface area dried up fao 2012 70 of turkmenistan s land turned into desert and half of uzbekistan s soil had salinization problem varis 2014 iii food insecurity the water scarcity further put potential risks to food security according to fao et al 2020 nearly 9 6 million people in central asia face severe food insecurity in 2019 the prevalence of undernourishment in central asia was 3 0 in 2018 and will be 2 5 in 2030 iv water allocation contradiction tajikistan has a large number of hydroelectric power plants and its hydropower accounts for 98 of the total energy generation water rich upstream countries intercept runoff to generate electricity in summer leading to a sharp drop of water availability for downstream countries thus the upstream and downstream has conflict on water allocation therefore in order to alleviate the problems of water shortage food crisis and ecological degradation as well as balance the water conflicts between region i e central asia and multiple counties it is necessary to comprehensively manage the wfe nexus system 3 2 development of cbdp wfe model a cbdp wfe model is developed for central asia as shown fig 1 in detail for balancing the water conflicts between region i e central asia and countries as well as reflect synergies among multiple countries and restore the eco environment two level decision makers are considered in the cbdp wfe model to alleviate ecological degradation and achieve sustainable development the upper level model i e decision center aims to maximize system benefit including ecological benefit the lower level model i e the followers which involves five counties has five objectives to maximize benefits for individual countries respectively the cbdp wfe model involves six water sources five counties forty three states eight water users and six planning periods 2021 2050 in addition as shown in table 1 in order to explore the impacts of agricultural irrigation efficiency and ecological water demand on wfe nexus system three irrigation efficiency levels and three ecological water demand levels are designed in the planning model besides twelve joint constraint violation levels are designed to tackle the random uncertainty of water availability for amu darya and syr darya leading to 108 scenarios table 2 the cbdp wfe model is upper level the upper level objective of cbdp wfe model aims to maximize system benefit for central asia which includes the sectors of

demands are obtained from cawater website http www cawater info net and statistical yearbook unrcca 2019 the data related to agricultural irrigation are obtained from published papers jalilov et al 2016 sun et al 2020 the ecological water demands for amu darya and syr darya rivers are set according to published report dukhovny and sorokin 2017 in order to guarantee food security for central asia the amount of per capital food demand is set according to the report of fao et al 2020 due to the influence of a set of factors such as climate change upstream glacier melting population growth and agricultural irrigation the water availability for amu darya and syr darya has highly random uncertainty for tackling the problem of joint random uncertainty clayton copula is selected to simulate the joint cumulative distribution of water availability spearman s rank order i e 0 794 is applied to evaluate the dependence between the water availability of amu darya and that of syr darya the nash coefficient i e 0 99 is used for assessing the performance of copula simulation thus the obtained joint cumulative distributions under different planning periods are presented in fig 2 in table 3 based on the results of joint cumulative distributions hu v u v twelve joint constraint violation levels p with different individual constraint violation levels pu represents the probability of violating the water availability constraint for amu darya river and pv represents the probability of violating the water availability constraint for syr darya river are designed to tackle the random uncertainty of water resources availability 4 result and discussion 4 1 water allocation pattern fig 3 presents water allocation patterns for various users under all scenarios on the premise of food security for alleviating ecological degradation as the largest water user in central asia the proportion of agricultural water allocation should be reduced i e accounting for 50 6 60 5 over the planning horizon while the proportion of ecological water allocation should be increased i e accounting for 12 4 18 4 over the planning horizon besides the irrigation efficiency and ecological water demand level would also influence the water allocation structure in detail when the agricultural irrigation efficiency increases by 9 the proportion of agricultural water allocation would decrease by 3 3 11 3 while the proportion of water allocated to electricity generation would increase by 3 1 11 2 with ecological water demand level increasing i e from l to h the proportion of ecological water allocation would increase by 1 1 4 7 in addition the changing p level joint constraint violation level can also influence the water allocation structure which could help decision makers investigate the risk of constraint violation and obtain various management alternatives under random uncertainty in detail with the increase of p level the proportion of agricultural water allocation would decrease by 2 9 3 7 and that for electricity generation would increase by 4 8 9 7 this is because different joint constraint violation p level corresponds to different water availability with the rising p level the amount of water availability of amu darya and syr darya would be increase however the risk of constraint violation would also be increase therefore decision makers should adopt different water allocation schemes according to various water demand scenarios and different risk response attitudes fig 4 shows water resources allocation schemes under part of scenarios the results imply that amu darya river syr darya river and other source would be the main water sources for central asia accounting for 30 5 34 3 22 8 24 5 and 23 7 24 8 of total water supply respectively with the rising p level i e from 0 05 to 0 15 the total amount of water supply would increase by nearly 7 6 different individual constraint violation levels pu and pv would also influence the water resources allocation schemes for instance when pu increases from 0 02 to 0 08 the total amount of amu darya river s water supply would increase by nearly 16 1 when pv decreases from 0 09 to 0 03 the total amount of syr darya river s water supply would decrease by nearly 5 8 different p levels correspond with different water availability and constraint violation risks which leads to various water allocation schemes thus decision makers should adopt different water management policies according to his her attitude toward system failure risks besides in order to alleviate the competition for water resources among multiple countries it is important to optimize the water allocation structure among different countries the results show that uzbekistan would account for the largest proportion of water resources allocation i e 35 8 39 2 over the planning horizon followed by tajikistan i e 20 3 26 6 over the planning horizon with the increase of p level the proportion of tajikistan s water allocation would increase by 3 5 5 6 this is because the hydropower in central asia is mainly located in tajikistan with the rising p level more water resources can be distributed for hydropower which has high economic return than other water users in general according to different risk response attitudes decision makers can adopt different water resources management schemes through changing p level to strike a balance between the system benefit and constraint violation risk 4 2 ecological restoration fig 5 presents the results of total ecological water allocation including water resources allocated to ecological sector aral sea balkhash lake and isser lake under all scenarios which range from 496 3 109 m3 to 708 4 109 m3 for alleviating ecological degradation compared with current ecological water allocation proportion i e 7 at the end of planning periods the ecological water should account for 14 9 23 8 the results also show that for saving the extremely shrinking aral sea its ecological water distribution should account for 7 4 15 0 besides the amount of total ecological water allocation would show an increase trend during the planning periods at the end of planning horizon 2046 2050 under different scenarios the ecological water allocation for aral sea balkhash lake and isser lake would be 47 2 109 m3 to 82 1 109 m3 17 9 109 m3 to 26 7 109 m3 and 7 9 109 m3 to 13 0 109 m3 respectively when p level increases from 0 05 to 0 15 the total ecological water allocation would increase by 3 1 7 4 implying that higher p level leads to more water allocated for eco environment however the constraint violation risk would also be rising thus decision makers can make a compromise between ecological restoration and system failure risk in addition compared with conventional single level optimization model which only aims to maximize system benefit the total ecological water allocation obtained by cbdp wfe model would increase by 3 2 9 4 in detail for conventional single level model the total amount of ecological water allocation would be 491 3 109 m3 to 632 6 109 m3 under different scenarios while for cbdp wfe model the total ecological water allocation would be 507 2 109 m3 to 692 3 109 m3 therefore compared with conventional single level model the cbdp wfe model has advantage in alleviating ecological degradation for central asia 4 3 cultivated land area agriculture is the largest water consumer in central asia besides affected by water shortage and low agricultural irrigation efficiency central asia faces the food crisis problem thus it is necessary to plan cultivated land area to alleviate the problems of water shortage and food crisis fig 6 presents the schemes of cultivated land area for different states the results show that the average annual cultivated area for central asia would be 5961 8 103 ha to 6561 5 103 ha over the planning horizon of which the cereal crop accounts for the largest proportion i e 50 2 57 4 with the increase of p level the cultivated area would decrease by nearly 4 2 this is because high joint constraint violation level corresponds with large water availability the decision makers would adopt positive attitude toward water allocation by reducing agricultural water distribution for central asia however the risk of constraint violation would also be increase besides with the decrease of irrigation efficiency i e from h to l the total cultivated area would increase by 5 4 15 1 this is because low irrigation efficiency would lead to the decline of crop yields per unit area thus decision makers should expand the area of agricultural cultivation to meet economic development and food demand therefore decision makers can plan the agricultural cultivation area in central asia based on different attitudes e g positive moderate or negative toward constraint violation risk and irrigation efficiency besides due to the low benefit return for cereal crop decision makers should set strict baseline for cereal crop planting area to ensure food security 4 4 system benefit fig 7 presents system benefits under all scenarios which range from 43 6 1012 us to 96 3 1012 us different p levels have significant influence on system benefit in detail when the p level increases from 0 05 to 0 15 the system benefit would increase 13 5 1012 us to 24 8 1012 us it can be concluded that higher p level would result in an increased system benefit due to ascended water availability besides when agricultural irrigation efficiency decreases by 9 the system benefit would decrease by 22 9 32 5 because low irrigation efficiency would cause severe waste of water resources it can be seen that improving agricultural irrigation efficiency can not only save water resources but also increase system benefit in addition with the increase of ecological water demand level i e from l to h the system benefit would decrease by 11 6 19 9 this is because ecological water allocation would squeeze water resources distributed to other users resulting in the decline of system benefit therefore decision makers can increase system benefit by improving irrigation efficiency and make a tradeoff between ecological restoration and system benefit by setting different ecological water demand levels 4 5 policy implementation according to the optimization results some management suggestions can be provided for decision makers i the agricultural planting in central asia is still dominated by low efficiency flood irrigation improving irrigation efficiency can save agricultural water allocation and increase system benefit which further provides potential contribution to ecological restoration therefore it is recommended that decision makers increase advanced infrastructures such as sprinkle irrigation and drip irrigation to make the agricultural irrigation efficiency reach 0 57 at the end of the planning period 2046 2050 ii in order to ensure food security the water allocated for cereal crop should be at least 27 6 31 2 besides it is recommended that decision makers reduce agricultural water use and strictly enforce ecological water allocation baseline to alleviate ecological degradation iii the cooperation among five countries or multiple sectors is critical to mitigate vicious competition for water resources it is encouraged to explore opportunities for energy water exchange between upstream and downstream countries to ease competition for water resources iv it is suggested that decision makers can implement agricultural products trading or water rights trading to alleviate water conflicts among multiple sectors these policy recommendations can help decision makers synergistically manage the wfe nexus system to facilitate the sustainable development of central asia 5 conclusions a copula based bi level decentralized programming cbdp method has been developed for planning water food ecology wfe nexus system of central asia cbdp has advantages in balancing tradeoffs between different decision levels reflecting synergies among multiple managers and analyzing joint risks of interrelated uncertain parameters then a cbdp wfe model has been formulated to balance the conflict between the economic development and ecological restoration the upper level model aims to maximize system benefit for central asia and the lower level model involves five objectives which aim to maximize five countries benefit respectively besides 108 scenarios have been designed to analyze the impacts of agricultural irrigation efficiency ecological water demand level and joint constraint violation level p on wfe nexus system in general the results of the cbdp wfe model can provide managers with numerical decision supports to resolve the competition for water resources among the five countries ensure food security and restore ecological degradation in aral sea balkhash lake and isser lake major findings are i improving the agricultural irrigation efficiency can effectively adjust the water resources allocation proportion in central asia and increase the system benefit e g when irrigation efficiency increases by 9 the proportion of agricultural water allocation would decrease by 3 3 11 3 the proportion of water allocated to electricity generation would increase by 3 1 11 2 and the system benefit would increase by 22 9 32 5 ii in order to alleviate ecological degradation in central asia the proportion of ecological water allocation should be 13 7 23 8 over the planning horizon 2021 2050 particularly for saving the rapidly shrinking aral sea its ecological water allocation should account for 7 4 15 0 iii the joint violation risk i e p level has significant impact on the wfe nexus system in detail with the increase of p level the proportion of agricultural water allocation would decrease by 2 9 3 7 the cultivated area would decrease by nearly 4 2 the electricity generation would increase by 4 8 9 7 the system benefit would increase 13 5 1012 us to 24 8 1012 us iv higher p level corresponds with higher system benefit while the constraint violation risk would also increase therefore decision makers should adjust the management schemes by changing p level according to different risk response attitude e g optimistic or pessimistic v uzbekistan is the country with the largest water allocation in central asia followed by tajikistan thus in order to alleviate the vicious competition for water resources among multiple countries the water allocation proportion for uzbekistan should be 35 8 39 2 and the water allocation proportion for tajikistan should be 20 3 26 6 vi compared with conventional single level optimization model which only aims to maximize system benefit the ecological water allocation obtained from the cbdp wfe model would increase by 3 2 9 4 which shows the superiority of the developed model although the obtained results show that the coordinated management of wfe nexus system can effectively alleviate the problems of water shortage and ecological degradation in central asia some improvements can be made in future research in detail the upstream countries intercept water resources for electricity generation causing the water shortage and ecological degradation problems in downstream countries therefore it is crucial to consider the influence of electricity demand level on the wfe nexus system which could form the water food ecology energy nexus system besides for the real world planning problem the ambiguous and vague information would also lead to fuzzy uncertainty cbdp method has limitation in tackling such fuzzy information thus the fuzzy programming methods e g fuzzy flexible programming can be introduced to strength the robustness of the optimization method funding this research was supported by the strategic priority research program of chinese academy of sciences xda20060302 the authors are grateful to the editors and the anonymous

9543,vicious competition for limited water resources hinders the synergetic and sustainable development of central asian countries which further threatens food security and exacerbates ecological degradation in this study a copula based bi level decentralized programming cbdp method is developed and applied to planning water food ecology wfe nexus system cbdp has advantages in balancing tradeoffs between different decision levels analyzing synergies among multiple managers and reflecting joint risks of interrelated uncertain parameters then a cbdp wfe model is formulated for central asia where the upper level model aims to maximize system benefit for the region i e regional scale and the lower level model involves five objectives to maximize five countries benefits i e national scale respectively totally 108 scenarios are designed to analyze the impacts of joint constraint violation risk agricultural irrigation efficiency and ecological water demand results reveal that i improving agricultural irrigation efficiency can optimize the water allocation pattern as well as increase the system benefit ii in order to restore the regional eco environment the proportion of ecological water allocation should increase from 7 of the current level to 14 9 23 8 by 2050 iii water allocations to uzbekistan and tajikistan should be properly controlled especially when available water is scarce the results are helpful for managers in not only making decisions of water allocation among multiple users and countries but also gaining insight into synergetic management of wfe nexus under various system conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords bi level decentralized programming central asia copula synergetic management uncertainty water food ecology nexus 1 introduction with accelerated population increase rapid economic development and subversive consumption pattern change the problems of water scarcity food crisis and ecological degradation have become increasingly prominent in detail nearly 4 billion people face severe water shortage for at least one month per year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 around 52 of the world s population will live in water scarce areas by 2050 kölbel et al 2018 as the largest user of water agriculture accounts for 69 of global water withdrawals the growing food demand and expanding arable land exacerbate water scarcity however despite the tremendous efforts made by many countries for food security about 821 million people worldwide accounting for 11 of the total population still face severe malnutrition unesco and un water 2020 in addition degrading water resources and expanding agricultural land have led to extremely unfavorable ecological changes in some regions such as drying up of lakes extinction of native fish and outbreak of sandstorms salt storms thus the deteriorating ecosystem has to compete with the agricultural sector for limited water resources in general there is complex interweaving relationship among water food and ecology which forms the water food ecology wfe nexus system in order to alleviate water scarcity food crisis and ecological degradation it is necessary for decision makers to make synergetic management of wfe nexus system the wfe nexus system often involves multiple stakeholders with conflicting preferences and objectives e g economic development and ecological restoration which amplifies the complexity of synergetic management bi level programming bp is an effective method in balancing the conflict between different stakeholders and has been applied to tackle hierarchical decision making problems bostian et al 2015 zhang and vesselinov 2016 jin et al 2018 saeidi mobarakeh et al 2020 for example ma et al 2020 developed an interval stochastic bi level programming method to plan water energy nexus system in the city level where the targets of maximizing system benefit and minimizing energy consumption during water allocation can be optimized simultaneously yue et al 2020 proposed a type 2 fuzzy integer bi level programming method to distribute water resources for zhanghe irrigation district china in which the tradeoff between system benefit and agricultural profit was effectively balanced in general bp has advantages in resolving conflicts between two level decision makers in hierarchical structure in the real world wfe nexus system multiple stakeholders may have cooperative and interactive relationships the decision of one stakeholder has a profound impact on others making the process of synergetic management more complicated the conventional bp method has limitation in reflecting the interactions among multiple stakeholders bi level decentralized programming bdp with one decision center at the upper level and multiple stakeholders at the lower level can effectively make tradeoffs between different decision levels and reflect the synergies among multiple stakeholders ma et al 2021 in bdp the followers at lower level have their own objectives and can work cooperatively or uncooperatively through sharing variables thus the decisions of upper level can be influenced not only by the reactions of lower level individuals but also by the synergetic relationships among these individuals baky 2009 zhang and li 2010 however for the wfe nexus system affected by natural process and human induced imprecision some parameters and their interactions are characterized by random uncertainty which could bring great challenge to managers and reduce the reliability of management strategies hu et al 2021 mei et al 2021 for instance under the influence of precipitation evaporation and climate change the amount of available water for different sources cannot be measured by certain parameters but presented as various probability distribution functions surrounding the actual water flow li et al 2014 yue and guo 2021 copula based stochastic programming csp can fill above mentioned gap by estimating joint probability function with different marginals liu et al 2020 for example alizadeh et al 2018 developed a copula based stochastic hydro economic model to design irrigation system in iran where the joint risks of violating reservoir yield constraint were reflected shu et al 2019 proposed copula based interval bistochastic programming method to plan regional water allocation for zhanghe irrigation district china and analyzed the joint probability distribution of different hydrological variables zhang et al 2021 developed copula based stochastic fractional programming to optimize water food energy nexus system for aral sea basin in which the joint risks caused by random available sources e g water land and electricity were handled in general csp has advantage in tackling the random uncertain parameters with different probability distributions and unknown interrelationships typically the wfe nexus system of central asia has the characteristics of multi user multi component multi objective and multi uncertainty which further intensifies the competition for water resources and enlarges the complexity of the system however no previous study was reported on coupling csp with bdp for wfe nexus system of central asia therefore a copula based bi level decentralized programming cbdp method will be developed and applied for planning wfe nexus system of central asia cbdp will possess advantages in i balancing the tradeoffs between conflicting objectives in a hierarchical order ii reflecting synergies among multiple stakeholders which set in the same decision level iii tackling random uncertainty and analyzing joint constraint violation risk then a cbdp wfe model will be formulated for the wfe nexus system of central asia that involves two level decision makers with multiple stakeholders where the upper level objective corresponds to the entire region and the lower level objectives are associated with five countries totally 108 scenarios with different irrigation efficiency levels ecological water demand levels and joint constraint violation risks are analyzed results will help to i balance the contradiction between regional i e central asia and national i e five countries economic development ii reflect the interactive relationships among multiple countries in water allocation agricultural cultivation and ecological restoration iii disclose the influence of joint constraint violation risks on the synergetic management of wfe nexus system under various scenarios iv alleviate the competition for water resources among multiple stakeholders five countries upstream and downstream water users v identify the optimal water allocation scheme for multiple counties states users to ensure food security and ecological restoration the organization of this paper can be summarized as section 1 is the introduction which shows the motivation literature review innovation and contribution of this study section 2 presents the development of the cbdp method section 3 shows the formulation and application of cbdp wfe model in section 4 the major findings and the results related to water resources planting area and system benefit are discussed section 5 is the conclusion which summarized the innovation and main findings of this study 2 methodology bi level decentralized programming bdp with one decision center and multiple stakeholders is developed based on stackelberg games arora and gupta 2009 assuming x k1j and y ksj are vectors of decision variables controlled by upper and lower level planners respectively and f u and f ls are bounded performance functions for two level planners let s 1 represent decision center and s 2 3 s represents multiple stakeholders at the lower level the bdp method can be defined as 1a max x k 1 j f u x k 1 j y k s j c 111 x k 1 j c 112 y k s j where y ksj is obtained from 1b max y k 2 j f l 2 x k 2 j y k 2 j c 22 j x k 2 j c 22 j y k 2 j 1c max y k s j f l s x k s j y k s j c 2 s j

are constant matrices although bdp can balance the tradeoff between two levels and reflect synergies among multiple divisions it cannot tackle random uncertainty caused by natural changes e g climate change and precipitation and human induced activity moeini and soltani nezhad 2020 besides the joint random uncertainty would exist in real world planning problem since the interaction of random parameters with various probability distributions for example with the impacts of glacial meltwater precipitation and co exploitation the available water resources for different sources have the characteristic of interrelated random uncertainty which increases the complexity of synergetic management conventional stochastic optimization methods such as chance constraint programming can only tackle univariate random parameter through its probability distribution and has limitation in tackling joint random uncertainty copula is an effective tool to analyze the relationships among multivariate parameters yang et al 2020 sun et al 2021 according to frees and valdez 1998 assuming u1 u2 up are random variables u 1 u 2 u p are corresponding realization and the joint distribution function of random variables can be obtained through 2 c u 1 u 2 u p prob u 1 u 1 u 2 u 2 u p u p where c is a copula function based on the marginal distribution functions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f p x p for x 1 x 2 x p the multivariate distribution function can be obtained 3 c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f p x p f x 1 x 2 x p 4a max x k 1 j f u x k 1 j y k s j c 111 x k 1 j c 112 y k s j where y ksj is obtained from 4b max y k 2 j f l 2 x k 2 j y k 2 j c 22 j x k 2 j c 22 j y k 2 j 4c max y k s j f l s x k s j y k s j c 2 s j x k s j c 2 s j y k s j subject to 4d k k a 1 s x k s j a 2 s y k s j b s j ω p j s j 4e c f b s 1 ω f b s 2 ω f b s j ω 1 p s 4 f x k s j 0 k s j 4 g y k s j 0 k s j then an interactive fuzzy algorithm is applied to solve the developed method shih et al 1996 wang and zhang 2018 for this algorithm the upper level decision maker specifies his her preferred decision variable and leave some leeway which is modeled by membership function based on fuzzy set theory the multiple stakeholders at lower level should optimize their objectives separately then the obtained lower level solutions would be submitted and revised by upper level decision maker based on specified tolerance if the upper level decision maker is satisfied with the solution the global satisfactory solution would be obtained otherwise the upper level decision maker would change tolerances and repeats the process until the global satisfactory solution is reached in general the basic idea for the method is that two level decision makers maker compromises to find the global satisfactory solution in detail two level decision makers should solve their objectives individually assuming f u f u x k 1 j y k s j is optimal solution for upper level objective while f l s f l s x k s j y k s j are optimal solutions for lower level multiple objectives if the solution f u f u x k 1 j y k s j is equal to f l s f l s x k s j y k s j the global satisfactory solution would be same with f u f l s however since the conflicting characteristic between two level objective it is impractical or impossible for lower level decision makers to find the optimal solutions in such strict conditions thus as the decision center upper level decision maker should leave room or tolerance for the decision variable that lower level decision makers can search their optimal solution in a wider feasible domain therefore the upper level decision variable x k 1 j y k s j is allowed to fluctuate with the range of x k 1 j x k 1 j p x x k 1 j p x y k s j y k s j p y y k s j p y where p x and p y are tolerance values decided by upper level decision maker assuming i is column vector which has same dimension as decision variable λ is satisfactory degree parameter which ranges from 0 to 1 μ x k 1 j x k 1 j is the membership function for upper level decision variable the satisfaction for decision maker increases within the range of x k 1 j p x 0 and decreases within the range of 0 x k 1 j p x since the upper level objective is a maximize problem the upper level decision maker would accept the solution which satisfied f u f u and reject the solution which satisfied f u f u x k s j y k s j the preference within the range of f u f u would be linearly increasing thus the membership function for upper level objective can be formulated as μ u f u x k 1 j y k s j similarly the membership functions for multiple lower level objectives are μ l s f l s x k s j y k s j where s represents multiple stakeholders in the lower level then the global optimal solution for cbdp i e f u o p t f l s o p t and x k s j o p t

tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan and forty three states with an area of 4003 4 103 km2 and a population of 66 4 106 most of central asia is located in the arid zone and water resources are critical important for its economic development however central asia faces a number of problems such as water shortage food insecurity and ecological degradation in detail i excessive water consumption for agriculture under the soviet regime central asia vigorously expanded arable land and irrigated desert or steppe to produce cotton leading to excessive consumption of agricultural water accounting for 85 of total water withdrawal in addition the irrigation mainly relied on flood thus the low irrigation efficiency intensified water demand to satisfy large amount of water demand for agriculture more than 80 reservoirs were built each with a capacity of at least 10 million m3 which caused over exploitation of water resources world bank 2003 ii eco environment deterioration water shortage led to a reduction in ecological water distribution causing the extinction of native fish the outbreak of sandstorms salt storms and the degradation of delta biomes in recent decades the swamps and wetlands almost disappeared from 550 103 ha in the 1960 s to 20 103 ha in the 1990s more than 50 lakes with 60 103 ha of surface area dried up fao 2012 70 of turkmenistan s land turned into desert and half of uzbekistan s soil had salinization problem varis 2014 iii food insecurity the water scarcity further put potential risks to food security according to fao et al 2020 nearly 9 6 million people in central asia face severe food insecurity in 2019 the prevalence of undernourishment in central asia was 3 0 in 2018 and will be 2 5 in 2030 iv water allocation contradiction tajikistan has a large number of hydroelectric power plants and its hydropower accounts for 98 of the total energy generation water rich upstream countries intercept runoff to generate electricity in summer leading to a sharp drop of water availability for downstream countries thus the upstream and downstream has conflict on water allocation therefore in order to alleviate the problems of water shortage food crisis and ecological degradation as well as balance the water conflicts between region i e central asia and multiple counties it is necessary to comprehensively manage the wfe nexus system 3 2 development of cbdp wfe model a cbdp wfe model is developed for central asia as shown fig 1 in detail for balancing the water conflicts between region i e central asia and countries as well as reflect synergies among multiple countries and restore the eco environment two level decision makers are considered in the cbdp wfe model to alleviate ecological degradation and achieve sustainable development the upper level model i e decision center aims to maximize system benefit including ecological benefit the lower level model i e the followers which involves five counties has five objectives to maximize benefits for individual countries respectively the cbdp wfe model involves six water sources five counties forty three states eight water users and six planning periods 2021 2050 in addition as shown in table 1 in order to explore the impacts of agricultural irrigation efficiency and ecological water demand on wfe nexus system three irrigation efficiency levels and three ecological water demand levels are designed in the planning model besides twelve joint constraint violation levels are designed to tackle the random uncertainty of water availability for amu darya and syr darya leading to 108 scenarios table 2 the cbdp wfe model is upper level the upper level objective of cbdp wfe model aims to maximize system benefit for central asia which includes the sectors of

demands are obtained from cawater website http www cawater info net and statistical yearbook unrcca 2019 the data related to agricultural irrigation are obtained from published papers jalilov et al 2016 sun et al 2020 the ecological water demands for amu darya and syr darya rivers are set according to published report dukhovny and sorokin 2017 in order to guarantee food security for central asia the amount of per capital food demand is set according to the report of fao et al 2020 due to the influence of a set of factors such as climate change upstream glacier melting population growth and agricultural irrigation the water availability for amu darya and syr darya has highly random uncertainty for tackling the problem of joint random uncertainty clayton copula is selected to simulate the joint cumulative distribution of water availability spearman s rank order i e 0 794 is applied to evaluate the dependence between the water availability of amu darya and that of syr darya the nash coefficient i e 0 99 is used for assessing the performance of copula simulation thus the obtained joint cumulative distributions under different planning periods are presented in fig 2 in table 3 based on the results of joint cumulative distributions hu v u v twelve joint constraint violation levels p with different individual constraint violation levels pu represents the probability of violating the water availability constraint for amu darya river and pv represents the probability of violating the water availability constraint for syr darya river are designed to tackle the random uncertainty of water resources availability 4 result and discussion 4 1 water allocation pattern fig 3 presents water allocation patterns for various users under all scenarios on the premise of food security for alleviating ecological degradation as the largest water user in central asia the proportion of agricultural water allocation should be reduced i e accounting for 50 6 60 5 over the planning horizon while the proportion of ecological water allocation should be increased i e accounting for 12 4 18 4 over the planning horizon besides the irrigation efficiency and ecological water demand level would also influence the water allocation structure in detail when the agricultural irrigation efficiency increases by 9 the proportion of agricultural water allocation would decrease by 3 3 11 3 while the proportion of water allocated to electricity generation would increase by 3 1 11 2 with ecological water demand level increasing i e from l to h the proportion of ecological water allocation would increase by 1 1 4 7 in addition the changing p level joint constraint violation level can also influence the water allocation structure which could help decision makers investigate the risk of constraint violation and obtain various management alternatives under random uncertainty in detail with the increase of p level the proportion of agricultural water allocation would decrease by 2 9 3 7 and that for electricity generation would increase by 4 8 9 7 this is because different joint constraint violation p level corresponds to different water availability with the rising p level the amount of water availability of amu darya and syr darya would be increase however the risk of constraint violation would also be increase therefore decision makers should adopt different water allocation schemes according to various water demand scenarios and different risk response attitudes fig 4 shows water resources allocation schemes under part of scenarios the results imply that amu darya river syr darya river and other source would be the main water sources for central asia accounting for 30 5 34 3 22 8 24 5 and 23 7 24 8 of total water supply respectively with the rising p level i e from 0 05 to 0 15 the total amount of water supply would increase by nearly 7 6 different individual constraint violation levels pu and pv would also influence the water resources allocation schemes for instance when pu increases from 0 02 to 0 08 the total amount of amu darya river s water supply would increase by nearly 16 1 when pv decreases from 0 09 to 0 03 the total amount of syr darya river s water supply would decrease by nearly 5 8 different p levels correspond with different water availability and constraint violation risks which leads to various water allocation schemes thus decision makers should adopt different water management policies according to his her attitude toward system failure risks besides in order to alleviate the competition for water resources among multiple countries it is important to optimize the water allocation structure among different countries the results show that uzbekistan would account for the largest proportion of water resources allocation i e 35 8 39 2 over the planning horizon followed by tajikistan i e 20 3 26 6 over the planning horizon with the increase of p level the proportion of tajikistan s water allocation would increase by 3 5 5 6 this is because the hydropower in central asia is mainly located in tajikistan with the rising p level more water resources can be distributed for hydropower which has high economic return than other water users in general according to different risk response attitudes decision makers can adopt different water resources management schemes through changing p level to strike a balance between the system benefit and constraint violation risk 4 2 ecological restoration fig 5 presents the results of total ecological water allocation including water resources allocated to ecological sector aral sea balkhash lake and isser lake under all scenarios which range from 496 3 109 m3 to 708 4 109 m3 for alleviating ecological degradation compared with current ecological water allocation proportion i e 7 at the end of planning periods the ecological water should account for 14 9 23 8 the results also show that for saving the extremely shrinking aral sea its ecological water distribution should account for 7 4 15 0 besides the amount of total ecological water allocation would show an increase trend during the planning periods at the end of planning horizon 2046 2050 under different scenarios the ecological water allocation for aral sea balkhash lake and isser lake would be 47 2 109 m3 to 82 1 109 m3 17 9 109 m3 to 26 7 109 m3 and 7 9 109 m3 to 13 0 109 m3 respectively when p level increases from 0 05 to 0 15 the total ecological water allocation would increase by 3 1 7 4 implying that higher p level leads to more water allocated for eco environment however the constraint violation risk would also be rising thus decision makers can make a compromise between ecological restoration and system failure risk in addition compared with conventional single level optimization model which only aims to maximize system benefit the total ecological water allocation obtained by cbdp wfe model would increase by 3 2 9 4 in detail for conventional single level model the total amount of ecological water allocation would be 491 3 109 m3 to 632 6 109 m3 under different scenarios while for cbdp wfe model the total ecological water allocation would be 507 2 109 m3 to 692 3 109 m3 therefore compared with conventional single level model the cbdp wfe model has advantage in alleviating ecological degradation for central asia 4 3 cultivated land area agriculture is the largest water consumer in central asia besides affected by water shortage and low agricultural irrigation efficiency central asia faces the food crisis problem thus it is necessary to plan cultivated land area to alleviate the problems of water shortage and food crisis fig 6 presents the schemes of cultivated land area for different states the results show that the average annual cultivated area for central asia would be 5961 8 103 ha to 6561 5 103 ha over the planning horizon of which the cereal crop accounts for the largest proportion i e 50 2 57 4 with the increase of p level the cultivated area would decrease by nearly 4 2 this is because high joint constraint violation level corresponds with large water availability the decision makers would adopt positive attitude toward water allocation by reducing agricultural water distribution for central asia however the risk of constraint violation would also be increase besides with the decrease of irrigation efficiency i e from h to l the total cultivated area would increase by 5 4 15 1 this is because low irrigation efficiency would lead to the decline of crop yields per unit area thus decision makers should expand the area of agricultural cultivation to meet economic development and food demand therefore decision makers can plan the agricultural cultivation area in central asia based on different attitudes e g positive moderate or negative toward constraint violation risk and irrigation efficiency besides due to the low benefit return for cereal crop decision makers should set strict baseline for cereal crop planting area to ensure food security 4 4 system benefit fig 7 presents system benefits under all scenarios which range from 43 6 1012 us to 96 3 1012 us different p levels have significant influence on system benefit in detail when the p level increases from 0 05 to 0 15 the system benefit would increase 13 5 1012 us to 24 8 1012 us it can be concluded that higher p level would result in an increased system benefit due to ascended water availability besides when agricultural irrigation efficiency decreases by 9 the system benefit would decrease by 22 9 32 5 because low irrigation efficiency would cause severe waste of water resources it can be seen that improving agricultural irrigation efficiency can not only save water resources but also increase system benefit in addition with the increase of ecological water demand level i e from l to h the system benefit would decrease by 11 6 19 9 this is because ecological water allocation would squeeze water resources distributed to other users resulting in the decline of system benefit therefore decision makers can increase system benefit by improving irrigation efficiency and make a tradeoff between ecological restoration and system benefit by setting different ecological water demand levels 4 5 policy implementation according to the optimization results some management suggestions can be provided for decision makers i the agricultural planting in central asia is still dominated by low efficiency flood irrigation improving irrigation efficiency can save agricultural water allocation and increase system benefit which further provides potential contribution to ecological restoration therefore it is recommended that decision makers increase advanced infrastructures such as sprinkle irrigation and drip irrigation to make the agricultural irrigation efficiency reach 0 57 at the end of the planning period 2046 2050 ii in order to ensure food security the water allocated for cereal crop should be at least 27 6 31 2 besides it is recommended that decision makers reduce agricultural water use and strictly enforce ecological water allocation baseline to alleviate ecological degradation iii the cooperation among five countries or multiple sectors is critical to mitigate vicious competition for water resources it is encouraged to explore opportunities for energy water exchange between upstream and downstream countries to ease competition for water resources iv it is suggested that decision makers can implement agricultural products trading or water rights trading to alleviate water conflicts among multiple sectors these policy recommendations can help decision makers synergistically manage the wfe nexus system to facilitate the sustainable development of central asia 5 conclusions a copula based bi level decentralized programming cbdp method has been developed for planning water food ecology wfe nexus system of central asia cbdp has advantages in balancing tradeoffs between different decision levels reflecting synergies among multiple managers and analyzing joint risks of interrelated uncertain parameters then a cbdp wfe model has been formulated to balance the conflict between the economic development and ecological restoration the upper level model aims to maximize system benefit for central asia and the lower level model involves five objectives which aim to maximize five countries benefit respectively besides 108 scenarios have been designed to analyze the impacts of agricultural irrigation efficiency ecological water demand level and joint constraint violation level p on wfe nexus system in general the results of the cbdp wfe model can provide managers with numerical decision supports to resolve the competition for water resources among the five countries ensure food security and restore ecological degradation in aral sea balkhash lake and isser lake major findings are i improving the agricultural irrigation efficiency can effectively adjust the water resources allocation proportion in central asia and increase the system benefit e g when irrigation efficiency increases by 9 the proportion of agricultural water allocation would decrease by 3 3 11 3 the proportion of water allocated to electricity generation would increase by 3 1 11 2 and the system benefit would increase by 22 9 32 5 ii in order to alleviate ecological degradation in central asia the proportion of ecological water allocation should be 13 7 23 8 over the planning horizon 2021 2050 particularly for saving the rapidly shrinking aral sea its ecological water allocation should account for 7 4 15 0 iii the joint violation risk i e p level has significant impact on the wfe nexus system in detail with the increase of p level the proportion of agricultural water allocation would decrease by 2 9 3 7 the cultivated area would decrease by nearly 4 2 the electricity generation would increase by 4 8 9 7 the system benefit would increase 13 5 1012 us to 24 8 1012 us iv higher p level corresponds with higher system benefit while the constraint violation risk would also increase therefore decision makers should adjust the management schemes by changing p level according to different risk response attitude e g optimistic or pessimistic v uzbekistan is the country with the largest water allocation in central asia followed by tajikistan thus in order to alleviate the vicious competition for water resources among multiple countries the water allocation proportion for uzbekistan should be 35 8 39 2 and the water allocation proportion for tajikistan should be 20 3 26 6 vi compared with conventional single level optimization model which only aims to maximize system benefit the ecological water allocation obtained from the cbdp wfe model would increase by 3 2 9 4 which shows the superiority of the developed model although the obtained results show that the coordinated management of wfe nexus system can effectively alleviate the problems of water shortage and ecological degradation in central asia some improvements can be made in future research in detail the upstream countries intercept water resources for electricity generation causing the water shortage and ecological degradation problems in downstream countries therefore it is crucial to consider the influence of electricity demand level on the wfe nexus system which could form the water food ecology energy nexus system besides for the real world planning problem the ambiguous and vague information would also lead to fuzzy uncertainty cbdp method has limitation in tackling such fuzzy information thus the fuzzy programming methods e g fuzzy flexible programming can be introduced to strength the robustness of the optimization method funding this research was supported by the strategic priority research program of chinese academy of sciences xda20060302 the authors are grateful to the editors and the anonymous

rosegrant et al 2013 an increase in rice production requires increased consumption of chemical fertilizers and pesticides darzi naftchali and mokhtassi bidgoli 2022 which in addition to economic problems have negative effects on the environment and ecosystems upset the ecological balance in various resources such as water and soil and increase greenhouse gas emissions veisi et al 2015 it is estimated that the agricultural sector accounts for 10 20 of global greenhouse gas emissions tubiello et al 2013 while 52 of which comes from paddy fields sun et al 2018 as the second largest source of methane production smith et al 2014 additionally excessive water consumption in rice production systems and the consumption of non renewable energy sources such as diesel fuel especially in developing countries lead to depletion of these non renewable resources continuous waterlogging during rainy seasons is reported as a major obstacle in decreasing the productivity of the fields ogino and ota 2007 under such conditions improving the internal drainage of the soil can bring positive consequences to truly assess these effects a subsurface drainage pilot with different drain depth and spacing was established in 2011 in the paddy fields of northern iran after introducing subsurface drainage systems the pilot area was under rice canola cropping rotation during the canola growing period november may free drainage was practiced two water management strategies including mid season drainage msd and alternate wetting and drying awd were adopted during rice growing seasons the msd strategy keeps soil conditions oxidative for about seven days towards the end of tillering resulting in a decrease in ch4 production and an increase in root activity furukawa 2008 shiratori et al 2007 under awd the soil water is transformed from saturated to alternately saturated and unsaturated and rice fields are allowed to dry out during the non sensitive stages tan et al 2015 long term studies 2011 2017 in the pilot area revealed that subsurface drainage provided a suitable condition for year round cropping increased crop production and land productivity improved soil structure decreased salinity and waterlogging issues and improved nutrient use efficiency darzi naftchali et al 2013 darzi naftchali and shahnazari 2014 jafari talukolaei et al 2015 jafari talokolaei et al 2016 darzi naftchali et al 2016 darzi naftchali et al 2017a darzi naftchali et al 2017b darzi naftchali et al 2018 jafari talokolaei et al 2018 darzi naftchali and ritzema 2018 darzi naftchali and karandish 2019 asgari et al 2020 moreover shallower drains were more effective than deeper ones to control waterlogging during wet seasons with more frequent rainfall similar positive effects of subsurface drainage have been reported in other studies for different parts of the world mathew et al 2001 ritzema et al 2008 shiratori et al 2007 furukawa et al 2008 chu et al 2014 despite the mentioned positive effects that can be achieved through the combination of structural and managerial changes sustainable production in the subsurface drained paddy fields requires quantifying and controlling all possible environmental effects of the operating system the life cycle assessment lca approach can be used to assess the potential environmental effects of crop production from raw material production to final product and disposal arvanitoyannis et al 2014 by considering all input and output sources in the whole production system brentrup et al 2004 this technique analyzes other environmental effects such as acidification the toxicity of the environment depletion of resources etc which can ultimately be used to reduce the environmental impact in different stages of the production system shafie et al 2014 the lca follows standards developed from 1997 to 2006 in iso 14040 to iso14044 hammond and jones 2008 in recent years the lca concept has been considered in various studies worldwide to evaluate different cropping systems in a survey of 200 semi mechanized paddy fields in the north of iran habibi et al 2019 revealed that the production of one ton of unground rice releases 1 39 tons of co2 comparing organic and traditional rice cultivation systems showed higher energy inputs for the conventional system of which fuel and electricity accounted for the largest share mansoori et al 2012 based on lca the most significant impact of canola cultivation was reported to happen due to chemical fertilizers and fossil fuels khanali et al 2018 in a rice canola rotation system rice cultivation showed to release more n2o than that of canola moreover 87 of the global warming potential was related to methane emission during the rice growing season zhou et al 2015 investigation of the life cycle of cultivating nine crops in rotation with rice revealed that the highest energy demand and co2 emission happened in the rice canola rotation panahi morandini 2020 the lca of crop production in china showed that the environmental issues were mainly related to direct consumption fertilizer production and diesel production which increased from 2008 to 2015 and declined in 2016 zhai et al 2021 the lca concept was also applied to compare single score ecosystem effects for cascade versus multiple inlet rice irrigation shew et al 2021 by using lca liang et al 2018 analyzed the paddy land to dryland program and demonstrated that the program improved overall environmental performance chen et al 2021 revealed that the lca concept was a suitable tool for phosphorus fertilizer management to reduce the environmental effects of the winter wheat summer maize rotation system common and useful effects are generally considered in evaluating the performance assessment of subsurface drainage systems however these systems can upset the natural balance of agricultural land and surrounding ecosystems resulting in a variety of negative environmental effects lack of careful consideration of these effects leads to incorrect evaluation and justification of the development of subsurface drainage systems the literature review indicated the lack of comprehensive research for performance assessment of subsurface drainage systems by using environmental indices given the growing environmental challenges associated with agricultural land drainage for the first time this study was aimed to assess the environmental effects of different subsurface drainage systems using the lca concept to achieve the goal different environmental indicators including human health ecosystem quality climate change and resource use were assessed under four subsurface drainage systems and two water management strategies in a rice canola rotation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experimental data were obtained from a consolidated subsurface drained paddy field in mazandaran province north of iran during four rice and four canola growing seasons 2011 2016 the average annual rainfall and temperature in the region are 616 mm and 16 4 c respectively the field included three types of conventional subsurface drainage systems consisting with a depth of 0 9 m and a spacing of 30 m d0 9l30 a depth of 0 65 m and a spacing of 30 m d0 65l30 and a depth of 0 65 m and a spacing of 15 m d0 65l15 and a bilevel subsurface drainage system consisting of 4 drain pipes at a spacing of 15 m and with depths of 0 65 and 0 9 m bilevel a paddy plot with conventional surface drainage was considered as a control system control the geographical location of the experimental site and the layout of drainage systems are shown in fig 1 2 2 water management strategies mid season drainage msd and alternate wetting and drying awd were followed during rice growing seasons msd 2011 12 and awd 2014 15 and free drainage fd was practiced during canola growing seasons four growing seasons during 2011 16 therefore the study included four rice canola growing cycles two msd fd cycles and two awd fd cycles under msd and awd one and two drainage periods were adopted during vegetative growth of rice respectively the field was drained for a 7 day period starting 25 days after transplanting dat under msd the awd was adopted through two periods of drainage 25 34 and 43 47 dat in 2014 and 28 32 and 39 43 dat in 2015 under both water management strategies the field was drained for a 7 14 period before harvest unless drainage periods flooding irrigation with a water depth of about 5 cm was maintained in the field 2 3 field management strategies daylamni rice cultivar was transplanted in the rice growing seasons 21 july 10 october 2011 28 may 11 august 2012 10 may 5 august 2014 and 4 jun 28 august 2015 after rice harvest canola hayola 401 was seeded at the rate of 6 8 kg ha 1 under rainfed conditions 28 november 2011 8 may 2012 4 october 2012 15 may 2013 10 october 2014 10 may 2015 3 october 2015 4 may 2016 common operations in the region such as fertilization weeding and other field practices were done by an experienced farmer to assess real farmer field conditions basal fertilization was done as 140 100 50 and 50 kg ha 1 triple superphosphate in 2011 2014 and 2015 rice growing seasons and 2015 16 canola growing season respectively 100 and 50 kg ha 1 k2so4 in 2014 and 2015 rice growing seasons 80 and 100 kg ha 1 k2so4 in 2014 and 2015 rice growing seasons top dress

practices during the study period were presented in darzi naftchali and ritzema 2018 and darzi naftchali et al 2018 2 4 life cycle assessment using the life cycle assessment lca concept the effectiveness of different drainage systems were assessed under the cycles of msd fd and awd fd the lca concept is one of the most comprehensive indices for assessing environmental sustainability based on the iso 14040 iso 14040 2006 in the present study the lca method was applied using simapro 9 0 software to assess the performance of the d0 9l30 bilevel d0 65l30 d0 65l15 and control drainage systems under rice canola rotation this method consists of four stages including the definition of goal and scope of the study life cycle inventory lci impact assessment lcia and interpretation georgiopoulou and lyberatos 2018 in the first step the expected final product the boundaries of the study system and the function unit were specified based on the international life cycle data system irlcds khoshnevisan et al 2013 the system boundary energy flow consumable materials and agricultural operations in different drainage systems are given in fig 2a and fig 2b for rice and canola cultivation respectively the farm gates farm input to output were selected as system boundaries production of one ton of canola and rice was considered a functional unit according to soheili fard et al 2018 according to iso 14040 brentrup et al 2004 the data related to inputs to rice and canola growing seasons chemical fertilizers fossil fuels chemical pesticides electricity etc and the release of pollutants were collected during growing seasons a complete description of the management strategies and applied equipment during the study period are given in table 1 pollutant emissions at the field level are classified into emissions from the combustion of diesel fuel chemical fertilizers and pesticides the direct gas emissions due to consumption of one liter of diesel derived based on the uslci database u s lci 2015 are presented in table 2 table 3 shows the emission coefficients of various inputs phosphate leaching nitrate leaching no3 nitrous oxide n2o ammonia nh3 nitrogen oxide nox and carbon dioxide co2 emissions were calculated using emission models the amount of daily ch4 emission during the rice growing period in conventional paddy fields of iran was reported as 1 1 kg per ha ipcc 2006 which was applied for the control system the effect of water management msd and awd on ch4 and n2o emissions was determined based on zou et al 2005 and li et al 2011 moreover the results of hashemi et al 2015 was applied to calculate the effect of subsurface drainage systems on emissions of ch4 and n2o the emission of various toxins pesticides fungicides and herbicides was calculated by using the method of van den berg et al 1999 the heavy metals released into the soil due to the consumption of chemical fertilizers were estimated based on mousavi avval et al 2017 table 4 to quantify out of field pollutants due to consumption of various inputs such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides agricultural machinery pvc electricity diesel and nylon used to produce rice and canola the ecoinvent version 3 0 database was used the impact 2002 method developed at the swiss federal institute of technology was used to quantitatively analyze the results hischier et al 2015 this method classifies environmental effects into 15 intermediate categories and four final indicators according to fig 3 hosseini fashami et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 input output analysis the amount of different inputs fuels chemical fertilizers chemical pesticides etc and the related emissions are presented in tables 5 and 6 respectively the control system produced more ch4 and n2o emission than the subsurface drainage systems under both water management strategies in rice canola cropping system the d0 9l30 system was least effective system which decreased ch4 emission by 20 92 and 49 98 under awd fd and msd fd respectively compared with same management in control however the most effective drainage system d0 65l15 reduced ch4 emission by 52 85 and 64 29 compared with control under awd fd and msd fd respectively generally the subsurface drainage systems were more effective than control to diminish ch4 emission under msd fd however ch4 emissions in msd fd was 26 more than that in awd fd the production of ch4 in paddy fields is affected by ch4 formation by bacteria under anaerobic conditions and ch4 metabolism as a source of carbon and energy in aerobic conditions by bacteria and micro organisms chan and parkin 2001a 2001b under both awd and msd there are suitable conditions to produce ch4 by microorganisms during irrigation and anaerobic conditions on the other hand soil carbon and nitrogen cycles are affected by the frequency and intensity of wetting and drying xiang et al 2008 aerobic conditions during drying will also oxidize ch4 due to the heavy soil texture in the study site the d0 65l15 drainage system was more effective to provide aerobic conditions in the root zone resulting in better breaking down the ch4 production cycle due to better aeration and consequent nitrification shallower drainage systems produced more n2o gas emissions than deeper ones the d0 65l15 system reduced n2o emissions by 2 35 and 7 35 compared with control under awd fd and msd fd respectively among subsurface drainage systems the lowest n2o emission was related to bilevel and d0 9l30 on average subsurface drainage caused a 12 35 and 18 38 reduction in n2o emission compared with control under awd fd and msd fd respectively nitrification is the main n2o production path when 60 70 of the soil pores are filled while denitrification becomes the main n2o production path for a soil having higher moisture than 70 for soil moisture higher than 80 n2o production will limit and only n2 will release therefore in shallower drainage systems with better nitrification conditions n2o production has increased the awd fd management produced on average 23 23 more n2o than msd due to better aerobic conditions more nitrification than denitrification under awd results in higher n2o production yao et al 2012 the drainage systems also affected the emission of heavy metals into the soil the highest amount of heavy metal emission in both water management strategies was observed in the control system and the highest contamination was related to lead metal the bilevel drainage system was the most effective system in modifying pollutants drainage improves soil structure and creates sustained preferential flow paths to the drain pipes jafari talokolaei et al 2018 which increases the mobility of metals and reduces their adsorption to soil particles surfaces deeper drains were more helpful in mitigating the environmental effects of heavy metals than shallower ones the behavior of heavy metals in soil depends on the factors affecting the adsorption of these metals on the soil surface such as organic matter content iron oxides or clay particles rattan et al 2005 a suitable condition for accumulating heavy metals in the surface layer reduces their transfer to a greater depth dao et al 2014 the decomposition of organic matter causes heavy metals to release increasing their concentration in soil solution such phenomenon may occur more rapidly under shallow drainage systems with better aeration conditions therefore better drying under awd fd led to 9 4 higher heavy metals than msd fd 3 2 environmental indicators 3 2 1 human health fig 4 shows the effects of drainage systems and water management on human health indices urea fertilizer was the most influential factor on the carcinogenic diseases index followed by electricity pvc and direct emission from the field fig 4a the pvc corrugated drain pipes increased carcinogenic risk in subsurface drainage systems compared with control among drainage systems the least carcinogenic effect was related to d0 9l30 in awd fd with only a 1 3 higher carcinogenicity than control under the same management due to more drain pipes per ha the d0 65l15 system intensified the carcinogenic effects with a 4 1 increase compared to control in general urea and electricity had a 36 1 and 20 6 share in carcinogenicity respectively excessive application of urea fertilizer and low nitrogen use efficiency in rice cropping systems may increase this negative environmental effects darzi naftchali et al 2017b hashemi et al 2020 in non carcinogenic diseases direct emissions from the field operations and pvc pipe had a major contribution with a share of 39 8 and 31 2 respectively fig 4b direct emissions are usually caused by diesel burning in agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers and pesticides the analysis revealed that under both water management strategies subsurface drainage systems especially those with more pvc drain pipes increased the risk of non carcinogenic diseases compared with control this is due to the vinyl chloride in pvc which poses a human risk both through respiration and skin and eyes atsdr 2006 this factor can also cause environmental effects through pollution of water and soil resources which highlights the importance of recycling pvc drain pipes at the end of their useful lifetime which will diminish the carcinogenic index in the subsurface drained area the awd fd strategy showed lower non carcinogenic risks compared with msd fd in this study 74 5 of inorganic respiration was related to direct emission from the field surface and the impact of nitrogen and diesel fertilizer misuse fig 4c subsurface drainage systems reduced this index by reducing direct emissions from the field the bilevel system under awd fd showed to be the most appropriate operating system which reduced the environmental effects by 13 4 compared to control moreover the deep drains had better performance than shallow ones the inorganic respiration index which is expressed as the effect of respiratory minerals on human health is one of the most critical environmental stressors that cause pathogenicity hänninen et al 2014 field operations and fossil fuels as well as consumption of nitrogen fertilizers influence on inorganic respiration index fossil fuels of diesel had the most impact 46 9 on the ionizing radiation index followed by the application of urea and triple superphosphate fertilizers 29 6 fig 4d in this index the control and bilevel systems were the worst and the best drainage systems respectively on the other hand providing annual crop production as well as increased yield in the subsurface drained area resulted in the negative environmental effects to decrease per unit crop produced diesel acetamide and nitrogen influenced ozone depletion by 50 19 4 and 20 4 respectively fig 4e the awd fd management was more effective than msd fd in diminishing this index the bilevel system under awd fd was the most efficient system reducing the environmental effects of ozone depletion by 12 over control in contrast the d0 65l15 system under msd fd had the least positive effect deeper drains were more effective than shallow ones to reduce the negative effects on the ozone layer agricultural machinery that uses diesel fuel can be a source of aggravation of ozone layer degradation additionally butachlor herbicide consumption is another source of ozone depletion this herbicide has a high destructive power due to chlorine in its structure and is classified in group one in terms of risk for water resources and ozone depletion nite cmc 2020 consuming organic phosphorus insecticides is another input that causes adverse effects on the ozone layer in general compared with control subsurface drainage reduced the negative environmental effects related to the organic respiration index fig 4f among different drainage systems bilevel provided better conditions by reducing this index moreover the awd fd management was more effective than msd fd about 23 of the organic respiration index was related to agricultural activities that led to the use of fossil fuels such as diesel fuel followed by direct emissions from the field and urea fertilizer an increase in temperature will increase the rate of respiration so that for every 10 c 18 f increase in temperature respiration rate doubles or even triples suslow 2000 this is of great importance during the rice growing season spring and summer in the north of iran diesel fuel from combustion in agricultural machinery also emits nox and hydrocarbons such as nmvoc which increases the risk of organic respiration 3 2 2 ecosystem quality the ecosystem quality is an integration of several indices including water toxicity soil toxicity soil acidification land use change acidification of water and eutrophication the integrated effects of drainage water management systems on ecosystem quality are shown in fig 5 the adverse impact of direct emissions from the field had a considerable share of 89 4 in the water toxicity index fig 5a subsurface drainage systems improved the relative environmental effects compared to control however there was no apparent difference between the two water management strategies the bilevel and d0 9l30 systems showed somewhat better responses than the others under msd fd input sources of phosphorus origin was another factor affecting the water toxicity index at a smaller level than direct emissions subsurface drainage reduced soil toxicity index by reducing the harmful effects of agriculture fig 5b the msd fd management had fewer environmental effects than awd fd from a soil toxicity viewpoint also the d0 65l15 system msd fd was able to provide better conditions than the other drainage water management systems direct emissions from the field resulted in the most negative environmental effects in this index 93 1 soil toxicity is closely related to the use of fertilizers and chemical pesticides in agriculture therefore improper consumption of these chemicals endangers the life of animal and plant species through effects on soil microbes invertebrates plants reptiles birds amphibians and mammals direct emissions from the field surface resulting from agricultural activities played a major role in soil acidification with 88 2 contribution fig 5c the msd fd management had a relative advantage over the awd method to reduce this index additionally the bilevel system under msd fd created the most favorable conditions than the rest drainage water management systems in general subsurface drainage reduced this negative environmental effect compared with control the use of chemical fertilizers had the largest share in the land use change index fig 5d triple superphosphate urea and potassium sulfate fertilizers by 57 8 13 5 and 5 5 influence respectively had the greatest effect on this index the awd fd strategy showed to have the best positive impact on land use change deeper drains were more suitable than shallow ones mainly due to the leaching of fertilizers and chemical toxins from thicker soil layers given that the land use shows the impact of agriculture on carbon sequestration soil erosion and extinction of plant species koellner et al 2013 it can be expected that the amount of this index to decrease considerably due to rice canola rotation in the subsurface drained area through optimal use of chemical fertilizers subsurface drainage relatively reduced the acidification of water compared to control fig 5e the bilevel system under msd fd was more successful than the rest drainage systems under both msd fd and awd fd in general the highest share of acidification of water resources belonged to direct emissions from the field with 77 3 contribution an increase in anthropogenic emissions of sulfur and nitrogen leads to increased leaching and the formation of acidic compounds in water sources in sensitive catchments this sediment leads to negative environmental effects on aquatic ecosystems and the destruction or extinction of the ecosystem therefore due to the presence of shallow groundwater and surface water bodies that are susceptible to acidification pollution from sulfur and nitrogen sources such as fossil fuels and urea should be reduced the share of organophosphorus fertilizers and pesticides was considerably higher over other input sources in the eutrophication index fig 5f in general awd fd reduced the potential for eutrophication moreover deeper drains had a greater impact on this phenomenon than shallow drains nitrogen fertilizer is an important factor affecting the eutrophication of water bodies n leaching from the rice cultivation system is generally less than that under rice upland crop rotation zhao et al 2009 due to aerobic conditions in the latter than flooding conditions due to the reduction of nh4 n in aerated soil the nitrogen concentration in receiving surface water decreases in the subsurface drained area gao et al 2016 darzi naftchali et al 2018 showed no significant difference between nitrate losses under awd and msd strategies during rice growing season however free drainage during canola cultivation resulted in significantly higher losses than those strategies in general less nitrate leaching has occurred in shallow drainage systems than in control mainly due to better aeration in the soil surface layer resulting in an oxidative environment favoring for nitrification toriyama et al 2011 and thus more nitrogen uptake by plant roots darzi naftchali and shahnazari 2014 the high percentage of phosphorus chemical pesticides applied to control insects and fungi on the field was the primary phosphorus source that contributed to the eutrophication phosphorous leaching is one of the main sources of phosphate entering water sources it was reported that among various inputs phosphate is the most crucial factor in intensifying eutrophication khoshnevisan et al 2013 gupta and ladha 2010 reported that the crop residues after rice harvest could result in continuous phosphorus release the msd fd management resulted in a higher potential for eutrophication than awd fd controlled drainage was reported as a suitable strategy to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus leaching in paddy fields compared with traditional drainage wesström et al 2014 among subsurface drainage systems the shallow systems resulted in more phosphorus leaching losses resulting from more preferential flows to the drainpipe in the surface layer of the soil beauchemin and simard 1999 3 2 3 climate change global warming potential which is expressed based on the carbon dioxide equivalent kg co2 eq iso 2006 shows the contribution of greenhouse gas emissions to environmental pollution and climate change fig 6 shows the integrated effects of drainage water management systems on global warming the direct emission from the field had the greatest impact on global warming 57 1 followed by urea fertilizer application 17 9 the awd fd management was able to mitigate the adverse impact related to this index compared with control subsurface drainage systems reduced global warming with the best response related to bilevel the effective factors involved in this index are the emissions of ch4 gas from the paddy field n2o gas due to nitrogen fertilizers and carbon dioxide from the soil and plant surface the amount of soil moisture influences the carbon and nitrogen cycle in the soil so that in flooding conditions the concentration of organic carbon is higher than that in aerated soil he et al 2017 the leaching of organic carbon is low in heavy clay soils with poor drainage said pullicino et al 2016 additionally under the wetting and drying cycle soil carbon and nitrogen decrease depending on the frequency of the wetting and drying as well as the intensity of drying xiang et al 2008 3 2 4 resource use the resource use is a combination of two indices including depletion of the non renewable resources and minerals the effects of drainage water management systems on resource use are shown in fig 7 fossil fuels and urea fertilizer with 43 5 and 28 9 contribution respectively had the most impact on the depletion of the non renewable resources index fig 7a the awd fd management was more effective than msd fd and subsurface drainage significantly reduced negative environmental impacts related to this index in general deep drains were more efficient than shallow ones in reducing the environmental effects of the use of chemical fertilizers especially urea fertilizer through increasing the nitrogen uptake by the plant by creating a suitable environment diesel as a widely used fuel in agricultural machinery in the country is a limited high cost non renewable source and needs to be replaced with renewable energy sources hosseini fashami et al 2019 consuming urea fertilizers with a 40 effect had a significant role compared to other chemical fertilizers on mineral resource depletion fig 7b the use of agricultural machinery during the growing season was another reason for the depletion of fossil resources subsurface drains especially deep drains were more effective than control the optimal consumption of chemical fertilizers following the soil test recommendations can be useful to reduce mineral resource depletion chemical fertilizers and fossil fuels have significant environmental effects iriarte et al 2010 khanali et al 2018 nie et al 2010 reported that using nitrogen fixing plants in a crop rotation can be a suitable strategy to prevent excessive nitrogen consumption in the production system on the other hand an increase in resource use efficiency is a sustainable solution to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural production especially in the rice production systems brentrup et al 2004 3 3 final effects the final environmental impacts in continuous rice canola cultivation are shown in table 7 compared with control subsurface drainage systems reduced the negative environmental impacts on human health ecosystem quality climate change and resource depletion respectively by 5 43 10 53 3 40 12 87 7 23 15 83 and 2 20 11 42 in awd fd in the msd fd management the reductions were 11 17 22 33 17 19 29 84 19 58 30 95 and 11 63 25 01 respectively in human health the bilevel drainage system performed satisfactorily compared to other systems by reducing human effects by 10 and 22 compared with control under awd fd and msd fd respectively considering the ecosystem quality bilevel resulted in a maximum reduction in environmental pollution 335 5 pdf m2 yr than other drainage systems under awd fd however the d0 65l15 under msd fd showed the best performance by reducing pollution by 835 8 pdf m2 yr compared with control mainly due to reducing soil toxicity effects in general msd fd resulted in a better ecosystem quality index than awd fd from a climate change viewpoint awd fd had better performance than msd fd which further reduced the destructive effects of climate change in agriculture by 10 the bilevel drainage system showed the best performance through decreasing climate change impact by 235 4 and 583 7 kg co2 eq compared with control under awd fd and msd fd respectively the response of resource depletion to subsurface drainage systems was similar to climate change with the best results related to the bilevel under awd fd generally bilevel under awd fd and control under msd fd were the best and the worst drainage water management systems respectively the effectiveness of different subsurface drainage systems to decrease environmental effects compared with control was much more evident in the msd fd management than the awd fd management under both water managements the best response was related to bilevel followed by d0 9l30 d0 65l30 and d0 65l15 especially for the climate change index fig 8 shows the total negative environmental effects of water management strategies and different drainage systems the awd water management showed to be significantly better than msd under continuous rice canola cultivation the awd strategy reduced the final environmental effects by 6 9 compared with msd the highest effectiveness of the strategy was related to the climate change index with a 9 98 reduction compared to the msd method also the mean comparison of the effect of different drainage systems showed that the negative environmental effects of control were significantly higher than those in the subsurface drained area moreover among subsurface drainage systems d0 65l1530 and d0 65l15 had significantly more negative impacts than d0 9l30 and bilevel an increase in drain depth resulted in a reduction in the environmental effects of continuous rice canola cropping also the bilevel system was relatively more effective than the other subsurface drainage systems by reducing the environmental effects by an average of 19 1 compared to the control system therefore the bilevel under awd fd is recommended as the best drainage water management in paddy fields for continuous rice canola production which results in less environmental pollution per unit tone of crop production 4 conclusions in this study the environmental effects of rice canola cropping pattern development in the subsurface drained paddy fields were evaluated using the life cycle assessment concept subsurface drainage systems reduced environmental effects under both awd fd and msd fd compared with control bilevel the most effective drainage system reduced the emissions of co2 n2o and ch4 by 13 6 12 9 and 38 8 in awd fd and by 26 1 61 1 and 19 1 in msd fd compared with control subsurface drainage also decreased nitrate and phosphate leaching by 9 4 and 4 6 in awd fd and by 17 8 and 25 9 in msd fd respectively compared with control a 10 more reduction in heavy metals entrance into the soil under msd fd than awd fd reduced the final ecosystem quality index by 7 2 in msd fd but in terms of human health climate change and resource depletion awd fd had an average advantage of 8 7 over msd fd the findings indicated deeper drainage systems were more effective in diminishing negative environmental effects than shallower ones declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

author the life cycle assessment lca concept is a widely used tool to assess the environmental aspects of any activity throughout its life cycle this study is the first application of lca for assessing the agro environmental sustainability of subsurface drainage systems under rice canola cropping rotation the systems included d0 65l15 d0 65l30 and d0 9l30 consisting of two depths d 0 65 and 0 9 m and two spacing l 15 and 30 m and a bi level drainage system with alternate depths of 0 9 and 0 65 m with 15 m spacing bilevel a paddy plot with conventional surface drainage and similar cropping system was considered as control control two water management strategies including mid season drainage msd and alternate wetting and drying awd were practiced during rice growing period free drainage fd was adopted during canola growing period required field data were collected during 2011 2016 including four rice canola growing cycles two msd fd cycles and two awd fd cycles using the lca concept the effectiveness of different drainage systems were assessed under the cycles of msd fd and awd fd the awd fd system showed 7 less environmental impacts than msd fd also awd fd reduced human health climate change and resource depletion indicators by 7 7 9 9 and 8 4 respectively compared with msd fd which improved the ecosystem quality index by 7 2 the bilevel d0 9l30 d0 65l30 and d0 65l15

environmental impacts by 18 6 compared with the conventional surface drainage system based on the results the lca concept can be used as a suitable tool to evaluate the performance of subsurface drainage systems before implementation on a large scale keywords agro environmental sustainability climate change ecosystem quality human health drainage management resource depletion 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l as the second major cereal cultivated globally supplies protein for a large number of the world s population he et al 2018 approximately 167 1 million ha of agricultural land were allocated for rice cultivation in 2018 which produced 782 million tons of rice fao 2019 predictions indicate that rice production should increase by 1 annually due to the increased world population rosegrant et al 2013 an increase in rice production requires increased consumption of chemical fertilizers and pesticides darzi naftchali and mokhtassi bidgoli 2022 which in addition to economic problems have negative effects on the environment and ecosystems upset the ecological balance in various resources such as water and soil and increase greenhouse gas emissions veisi et al 2015 it is estimated that the agricultural sector accounts for 10 20 of global greenhouse gas emissions tubiello et al 2013 while 52 of which comes from paddy fields sun et al 2018 as the second largest source of methane production smith et al 2014 additionally excessive water consumption in rice production systems and the consumption of non renewable energy sources such as diesel fuel especially in developing countries lead to depletion of these non renewable resources continuous waterlogging during rainy seasons is reported as a major obstacle in decreasing the productivity of the fields ogino and ota 2007 under such conditions improving the internal drainage of the soil can bring positive consequences to truly assess these effects a subsurface drainage pilot with different drain depth and spacing was established in 2011 in the paddy fields of northern iran after introducing subsurface drainage systems the pilot area was under rice canola cropping rotation during the canola growing period november may free drainage was practiced two water management strategies including mid season drainage msd and alternate wetting and drying awd were adopted during rice growing seasons the msd strategy keeps soil conditions oxidative for about seven days towards the end of tillering resulting in a decrease in ch4 production and an increase in root activity furukawa 2008 shiratori et al 2007 under awd the soil water is transformed from saturated to alternately saturated and unsaturated and rice fields are allowed to dry out during the non sensitive stages tan et al 2015 long term studies 2011 2017 in the pilot area revealed that subsurface drainage provided a suitable condition for year round cropping increased crop production and land productivity improved soil structure decreased salinity and waterlogging issues and improved nutrient use efficiency darzi naftchali et al 2013 darzi naftchali and shahnazari 2014 jafari talukolaei et al 2015 jafari talokolaei et al 2016 darzi naftchali et al 2016 darzi naftchali et al 2017a darzi naftchali et al 2017b darzi naftchali et al 2018 jafari talokolaei et al 2018 darzi naftchali and ritzema 2018 darzi naftchali and karandish 2019 asgari et al 2020 moreover shallower drains were more effective than deeper ones to control waterlogging during wet seasons with more frequent rainfall similar positive effects of subsurface drainage have been reported in other studies for different parts of the world mathew et al 2001 ritzema et al 2008 shiratori et al 2007 furukawa et al 2008 chu et al 2014 despite the mentioned positive effects that can be achieved through the combination of structural and managerial changes sustainable production in the subsurface drained paddy fields requires quantifying and controlling all possible environmental effects of the operating system the life cycle assessment lca approach can be used to assess the potential environmental effects of crop production from raw material production to final product and disposal arvanitoyannis et al 2014 by considering all input and output sources in the whole production system brentrup et al 2004 this technique analyzes other environmental effects such as acidification the toxicity of the environment depletion of resources etc which can ultimately be used to reduce the environmental impact in different stages of the production system shafie et al 2014 the lca follows standards developed from 1997 to 2006 in iso 14040 to iso14044 hammond and jones 2008 in recent years the lca concept has been considered in various studies worldwide to evaluate different cropping systems in a survey of 200 semi mechanized paddy fields in the north of iran habibi et al 2019 revealed that the production of one ton of unground rice releases 1 39 tons of co2 comparing organic and traditional rice cultivation systems showed higher energy inputs for the conventional system of which fuel and electricity accounted for the largest share mansoori et al 2012 based on lca the most significant impact of canola cultivation was reported to happen due to chemical fertilizers and fossil fuels khanali et al 2018 in a rice canola rotation system rice cultivation showed to release more n2o than that of canola moreover 87 of the global warming potential was related to methane emission during the rice growing season zhou et al 2015 investigation of the life cycle of cultivating nine crops in rotation with rice revealed that the highest energy demand and co2 emission happened in the rice canola rotation panahi morandini 2020 the lca of crop production in china showed that the environmental issues were mainly related to direct consumption fertilizer production and diesel production which increased from 2008 to 2015 and declined in 2016 zhai et al 2021 the lca concept was also applied to compare single score ecosystem effects for cascade versus multiple inlet rice irrigation shew et al 2021 by using lca liang et al 2018 analyzed the paddy land to dryland program and demonstrated that the program improved overall environmental performance chen et al 2021 revealed that the lca concept was a suitable tool for phosphorus fertilizer management to reduce the environmental effects of the winter wheat summer maize rotation system common and useful effects are generally considered in evaluating the performance assessment of subsurface drainage systems however these systems can upset the natural balance of agricultural land and surrounding ecosystems resulting in a variety of negative environmental effects lack of careful consideration of these effects leads to incorrect evaluation and justification of the development of subsurface drainage systems the literature review indicated the lack of comprehensive research for performance assessment of subsurface drainage systems by using environmental indices given the growing environmental challenges associated with agricultural land drainage for the first time this study was aimed to assess the environmental effects of different subsurface drainage systems using the lca concept to achieve the goal different environmental indicators including human health ecosystem quality climate change and resource use were assessed under four subsurface drainage systems and two water management strategies in a rice canola rotation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experimental data were obtained from a consolidated subsurface drained paddy field in mazandaran province north of iran during four rice and four canola growing seasons 2011 2016 the average annual rainfall and temperature in the region are 616 mm and 16 4 c respectively the field included three types of conventional subsurface drainage systems consisting with a depth of 0 9 m and a spacing of 30 m d0 9l30 a depth of 0 65 m and a spacing of 30 m d0 65l30 and a depth of 0 65 m and a spacing of 15 m d0 65l15 and a bilevel subsurface drainage system consisting of 4 drain pipes at a spacing of 15 m and with depths of 0 65 and 0 9 m bilevel a paddy plot with conventional surface drainage was considered as a control system control the geographical location of the experimental site and the layout of drainage systems are shown in fig 1 2 2 water management strategies mid season drainage msd and alternate wetting and drying awd were followed during rice growing seasons msd 2011 12 and awd 2014 15 and free drainage fd was practiced during canola growing seasons four growing seasons during 2011 16 therefore the study included four rice canola growing cycles two msd fd cycles and two awd fd cycles under msd and awd one and two drainage periods were adopted during vegetative growth of rice respectively the field was drained for a 7 day period starting 25 days after transplanting dat under msd the awd was adopted through two periods of drainage 25 34 and 43 47 dat in 2014 and 28 32 and 39 43 dat in 2015 under both water management strategies the field was drained for a 7 14 period before harvest unless drainage periods flooding irrigation with a water depth of about 5 cm was maintained in the field 2 3 field management strategies daylamni rice cultivar was transplanted in the rice growing seasons 21 july 10 october 2011 28 may 11 august 2012 10 may 5 august 2014 and 4 jun 28 august 2015 after rice harvest canola hayola 401 was seeded at the rate of 6 8 kg ha 1 under rainfed conditions 28 november 2011 8 may 2012 4 october 2012 15 may 2013 10 october 2014 10 may 2015 3 october 2015 4 may 2016 common operations in the region such as fertilization weeding and other field practices were done by an experienced farmer to assess real farmer field conditions basal fertilization was done as 140 100 50 and 50 kg ha 1 triple superphosphate in 2011 2014 and 2015 rice growing seasons and 2015 16 canola growing season respectively 100 and 50 kg ha 1 k2so4 in 2014 and 2015 rice growing seasons 80 and 100 kg ha 1 k2so4 in 2014 and 2015 rice growing seasons top dress

practices during the study period were presented in darzi naftchali and ritzema 2018 and darzi naftchali et al 2018 2 4 life cycle assessment using the life cycle assessment lca concept the effectiveness of different drainage systems were assessed under the cycles of msd fd and awd fd the lca concept is one of the most comprehensive indices for assessing environmental sustainability based on the iso 14040 iso 14040 2006 in the present study the lca method was applied using simapro 9 0 software to assess the performance of the d0 9l30 bilevel d0 65l30 d0 65l15 and control drainage systems under rice canola rotation this method consists of four stages including the definition of goal and scope of the study life cycle inventory lci impact assessment lcia and interpretation georgiopoulou and lyberatos 2018 in the first step the expected final product the boundaries of the study system and the function unit were specified based on the international life cycle data system irlcds khoshnevisan et al 2013 the system boundary energy flow consumable materials and agricultural operations in different drainage systems are given in fig 2a and fig 2b for rice and canola cultivation respectively the farm gates farm input to output were selected as system boundaries production of one ton of canola and rice was considered a functional unit according to soheili fard et al 2018 according to iso 14040 brentrup et al 2004 the data related to inputs to rice and canola growing seasons chemical fertilizers fossil fuels chemical pesticides electricity etc and the release of pollutants were collected during growing seasons a complete description of the management strategies and applied equipment during the study period are given in table 1 pollutant emissions at the field level are classified into emissions from the combustion of diesel fuel chemical fertilizers and pesticides the direct gas emissions due to consumption of one liter of diesel derived based on the uslci database u s lci 2015 are presented in table 2 table 3 shows the emission coefficients of various inputs phosphate leaching nitrate leaching no3 nitrous oxide n2o ammonia nh3 nitrogen oxide nox and carbon dioxide co2 emissions were calculated using emission models the amount of daily ch4 emission during the rice growing period in conventional paddy fields of iran was reported as 1 1 kg per ha ipcc 2006 which was applied for the control system the effect of water management msd and awd on ch4 and n2o emissions was determined based on zou et al 2005 and li et al 2011 moreover the results of hashemi et al 2015 was applied to calculate the effect of subsurface drainage systems on emissions of ch4 and n2o the emission of various toxins pesticides fungicides and herbicides was calculated by using the method of van den berg et al 1999 the heavy metals released into the soil due to the consumption of chemical fertilizers were estimated based on mousavi avval et al 2017 table 4 to quantify out of field pollutants due to consumption of various inputs such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides agricultural machinery pvc electricity diesel and nylon used to produce rice and canola the ecoinvent version 3 0 database was used the impact 2002 method developed at the swiss federal institute of technology was used to quantitatively analyze the results hischier et al 2015 this method classifies environmental effects into 15 intermediate categories and four final indicators according to fig 3 hosseini fashami et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 input output analysis the amount of different inputs fuels chemical fertilizers chemical pesticides etc and the related emissions are presented in tables 5 and 6 respectively the control system produced more ch4 and n2o emission than the subsurface drainage systems under both water management strategies in rice canola cropping system the d0 9l30 system was least effective system which decreased ch4 emission by 20 92 and 49 98 under awd fd and msd fd respectively compared with same management in control however the most effective drainage system d0 65l15 reduced ch4 emission by 52 85 and 64 29 compared with control under awd fd and msd fd respectively generally the subsurface drainage systems were more effective than control to diminish ch4 emission under msd fd however ch4 emissions in msd fd was 26 more than that in awd fd the production of ch4 in paddy fields is affected by ch4 formation by bacteria under anaerobic conditions and ch4 metabolism as a source of carbon and energy in aerobic conditions by bacteria and micro organisms chan and parkin 2001a 2001b under both awd and msd there are suitable conditions to produce ch4 by microorganisms during irrigation and anaerobic conditions on the other hand soil carbon and nitrogen cycles are affected by the frequency and intensity of wetting and drying xiang et al 2008 aerobic conditions during drying will also oxidize ch4 due to the heavy soil texture in the study site the d0 65l15 drainage system was more effective to provide aerobic conditions in the root zone resulting in better breaking down the ch4 production cycle due to better aeration and consequent nitrification shallower drainage systems produced more n2o gas emissions than deeper ones the d0 65l15 system reduced n2o emissions by 2 35 and 7 35 compared with control under awd fd and msd fd respectively among subsurface drainage systems the lowest n2o emission was related to bilevel and d0 9l30 on average subsurface drainage caused a 12 35 and 18 38 reduction in n2o emission compared with control under awd fd and msd fd respectively nitrification is the main n2o production path when 60 70 of the soil pores are filled while denitrification becomes the main n2o production path for a soil having higher moisture than 70 for soil moisture higher than 80 n2o production will limit and only n2 will release therefore in shallower drainage systems with better nitrification conditions n2o production has increased the awd fd management produced on average 23 23 more n2o than msd due to better aerobic conditions more nitrification than denitrification under awd results in higher n2o production yao et al 2012 the drainage systems also affected the emission of heavy metals into the soil the highest amount of heavy metal emission in both water management strategies was observed in the control system and the highest contamination was related to lead metal the bilevel drainage system was the most effective system in modifying pollutants drainage improves soil structure and creates sustained preferential flow paths to the drain pipes jafari talokolaei et al 2018 which increases the mobility of metals and reduces their adsorption to soil particles surfaces deeper drains were more helpful in mitigating the environmental effects of heavy metals than shallower ones the behavior of heavy metals in soil depends on the factors affecting the adsorption of these metals on the soil surface such as organic matter content iron oxides or clay particles rattan et al 2005 a suitable condition for accumulating heavy metals in the surface layer reduces their transfer to a greater depth dao et al 2014 the decomposition of organic matter causes heavy metals to release increasing their concentration in soil solution such phenomenon may occur more rapidly under shallow drainage systems with better aeration conditions therefore better drying under awd fd led to 9 4 higher heavy metals than msd fd 3 2 environmental indicators 3 2 1 human health fig 4 shows the effects of drainage systems and water management on human health indices urea fertilizer was the most influential factor on the carcinogenic diseases index followed by electricity pvc and direct emission from the field fig 4a the pvc corrugated drain pipes increased carcinogenic risk in subsurface drainage systems compared with control among drainage systems the least carcinogenic effect was related to d0 9l30 in awd fd with only a 1 3 higher carcinogenicity than control under the same management due to more drain pipes per ha the d0 65l15 system intensified the carcinogenic effects with a 4 1 increase compared to control in general urea and electricity had a 36 1 and 20 6 share in carcinogenicity respectively excessive application of urea fertilizer and low nitrogen use efficiency in rice cropping systems may increase this negative environmental effects darzi naftchali et al 2017b hashemi et al 2020 in non carcinogenic diseases direct emissions from the field operations and pvc pipe had a major contribution with a share of 39 8 and 31 2 respectively fig 4b direct emissions are usually caused by diesel burning in agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers and pesticides the analysis revealed that under both water management strategies subsurface drainage systems especially those with more pvc drain pipes increased the risk of non carcinogenic diseases compared with control this is due to the vinyl chloride in pvc which poses a human risk both through respiration and skin and eyes atsdr 2006 this factor can also cause environmental effects through pollution of water and soil resources which highlights the importance of recycling pvc drain pipes at the end of their useful lifetime which will diminish the carcinogenic index in the subsurface drained area the awd fd strategy showed lower non carcinogenic risks compared with msd fd in this study 74 5 of inorganic respiration was related to direct emission from the field surface and the impact of nitrogen and diesel fertilizer misuse fig 4c subsurface drainage systems reduced this index by reducing direct emissions from the field the bilevel system under awd fd showed to be the most appropriate operating system which reduced the environmental effects by 13 4 compared to control moreover the deep drains had better performance than shallow ones the inorganic respiration index which is expressed as the effect of respiratory minerals on human health is one of the most critical environmental stressors that cause pathogenicity hänninen et al 2014 field operations and fossil fuels as well as consumption of nitrogen fertilizers influence on inorganic respiration index fossil fuels of diesel had the most impact 46 9 on the ionizing radiation index followed by the application of urea and triple superphosphate fertilizers 29 6 fig 4d in this index the control and bilevel systems were the worst and the best drainage systems respectively on the other hand providing annual crop production as well as increased yield in the subsurface drained area resulted in the negative environmental effects to decrease per unit crop produced diesel acetamide and nitrogen influenced ozone depletion by 50 19 4 and 20 4 respectively fig 4e the awd fd management was more effective than msd fd in diminishing this index the bilevel system under awd fd was the most efficient system reducing the environmental effects of ozone depletion by 12 over control in contrast the d0 65l15 system under msd fd had the least positive effect deeper drains were more effective than shallow ones to reduce the negative effects on the ozone layer agricultural machinery that uses diesel fuel can be a source of aggravation of ozone layer degradation additionally butachlor herbicide consumption is another source of ozone depletion this herbicide has a high destructive power due to chlorine in its structure and is classified in group one in terms of risk for water resources and ozone depletion nite cmc 2020 consuming organic phosphorus insecticides is another input that causes adverse effects on the ozone layer in general compared with control subsurface drainage reduced the negative environmental effects related to the organic respiration index fig 4f among different drainage systems bilevel provided better conditions by reducing this index moreover the awd fd management was more effective than msd fd about 23 of the organic respiration index was related to agricultural activities that led to the use of fossil fuels such as diesel fuel followed by direct emissions from the field and urea fertilizer an increase in temperature will increase the rate of respiration so that for every 10 c 18 f increase in temperature respiration rate doubles or even triples suslow 2000 this is of great importance during the rice growing season spring and summer in the north of iran diesel fuel from combustion in agricultural machinery also emits nox and hydrocarbons such as nmvoc which increases the risk of organic respiration 3 2 2 ecosystem quality the ecosystem quality is an integration of several indices including water toxicity soil toxicity soil acidification land use change acidification of water and eutrophication the integrated effects of drainage water management systems on ecosystem quality are shown in fig 5 the adverse impact of direct emissions from the field had a considerable share of 89 4 in the water toxicity index fig 5a subsurface drainage systems improved the relative environmental effects compared to control however there was no apparent difference between the two water management strategies the bilevel and d0 9l30 systems showed somewhat better responses than the others under msd fd input sources of phosphorus origin was another factor affecting the water toxicity index at a smaller level than direct emissions subsurface drainage reduced soil toxicity index by reducing the harmful effects of agriculture fig 5b the msd fd management had fewer environmental effects than awd fd from a soil toxicity viewpoint also the d0 65l15 system msd fd was able to provide better conditions than the other drainage water management systems direct emissions from the field resulted in the most negative environmental effects in this index 93 1 soil toxicity is closely related to the use of fertilizers and chemical pesticides in agriculture therefore improper consumption of these chemicals endangers the life of animal and plant species through effects on soil microbes invertebrates plants reptiles birds amphibians and mammals direct emissions from the field surface resulting from agricultural activities played a major role in soil acidification with 88 2 contribution fig 5c the msd fd management had a relative advantage over the awd method to reduce this index additionally the bilevel system under msd fd created the most favorable conditions than the rest drainage water management systems in general subsurface drainage reduced this negative environmental effect compared with control the use of chemical fertilizers had the largest share in the land use change index fig 5d triple superphosphate urea and potassium sulfate fertilizers by 57 8 13 5 and 5 5 influence respectively had the greatest effect on this index the awd fd strategy showed to have the best positive impact on land use change deeper drains were more suitable than shallow ones mainly due to the leaching of fertilizers and chemical toxins from thicker soil layers given that the land use shows the impact of agriculture on carbon sequestration soil erosion and extinction of plant species koellner et al 2013 it can be expected that the amount of this index to decrease considerably due to rice canola rotation in the subsurface drained area through optimal use of chemical fertilizers subsurface drainage relatively reduced the acidification of water compared to control fig 5e the bilevel system under msd fd was more successful than the rest drainage systems under both msd fd and awd fd in general the highest share of acidification of water resources belonged to direct emissions from the field with 77 3 contribution an increase in anthropogenic emissions of sulfur and nitrogen leads to increased leaching and the formation of acidic compounds in water sources in sensitive catchments this sediment leads to negative environmental effects on aquatic ecosystems and the destruction or extinction of the ecosystem therefore due to the presence of shallow groundwater and surface water bodies that are susceptible to acidification pollution from sulfur and nitrogen sources such as fossil fuels and urea should be reduced the share of organophosphorus fertilizers and pesticides was considerably higher over other input sources in the eutrophication index fig 5f in general awd fd reduced the potential for eutrophication moreover deeper drains had a greater impact on this phenomenon than shallow drains nitrogen fertilizer is an important factor affecting the eutrophication of water bodies n leaching from the rice cultivation system is generally less than that under rice upland crop rotation zhao et al 2009 due to aerobic conditions in the latter than flooding conditions due to the reduction of nh4 n in aerated soil the nitrogen concentration in receiving surface water decreases in the subsurface drained area gao et al 2016 darzi naftchali et al 2018 showed no significant difference between nitrate losses under awd and msd strategies during rice growing season however free drainage during canola cultivation resulted in significantly higher losses than those strategies in general less nitrate leaching has occurred in shallow drainage systems than in control mainly due to better aeration in the soil surface layer resulting in an oxidative environment favoring for nitrification toriyama et al 2011 and thus more nitrogen uptake by plant roots darzi naftchali and shahnazari 2014 the high percentage of phosphorus chemical pesticides applied to control insects and fungi on the field was the primary phosphorus source that contributed to the eutrophication phosphorous leaching is one of the main sources of phosphate entering water sources it was reported that among various inputs phosphate is the most crucial factor in intensifying eutrophication khoshnevisan et al 2013 gupta and ladha 2010 reported that the crop residues after rice harvest could result in continuous phosphorus release the msd fd management resulted in a higher potential for eutrophication than awd fd controlled drainage was reported as a suitable strategy to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus leaching in paddy fields compared with traditional drainage wesström et al 2014 among subsurface drainage systems the shallow systems resulted in more phosphorus leaching losses resulting from more preferential flows to the drainpipe in the surface layer of the soil beauchemin and simard 1999 3 2 3 climate change global warming potential which is expressed based on the carbon dioxide equivalent kg co2 eq iso 2006 shows the contribution of greenhouse gas emissions to environmental pollution and climate change fig 6 shows the integrated effects of drainage water management systems on global warming the direct emission from the field had the greatest impact on global warming 57 1 followed by urea fertilizer application 17 9 the awd fd management was able to mitigate the adverse impact related to this index compared with control subsurface drainage systems reduced global warming with the best response related to bilevel the effective factors involved in this index are the emissions of ch4 gas from the paddy field n2o gas due to nitrogen fertilizers and carbon dioxide from the soil and plant surface the amount of soil moisture influences the carbon and nitrogen cycle in the soil so that in flooding conditions the concentration of organic carbon is higher than that in aerated soil he et al 2017 the leaching of organic carbon is low in heavy clay soils with poor drainage said pullicino et al 2016 additionally under the wetting and drying cycle soil carbon and nitrogen decrease depending on the frequency of the wetting and drying as well as the intensity of drying xiang et al 2008 3 2 4 resource use the resource use is a combination of two indices including depletion of the non renewable resources and minerals the effects of drainage water management systems on resource use are shown in fig 7 fossil fuels and urea fertilizer with 43 5 and 28 9 contribution respectively had the most impact on the depletion of the non renewable resources index fig 7a the awd fd management was more effective than msd fd and subsurface drainage significantly reduced negative environmental impacts related to this index in general deep drains were more efficient than shallow ones in reducing the environmental effects of the use of chemical fertilizers especially urea fertilizer through increasing the nitrogen uptake by the plant by creating a suitable environment diesel as a widely used fuel in agricultural machinery in the country is a limited high cost non renewable source and needs to be replaced with renewable energy sources hosseini fashami et al 2019 consuming urea fertilizers with a 40 effect had a significant role compared to other chemical fertilizers on mineral resource depletion fig 7b the use of agricultural machinery during the growing season was another reason for the depletion of fossil resources subsurface drains especially deep drains were more effective than control the optimal consumption of chemical fertilizers following the soil test recommendations can be useful to reduce mineral resource depletion chemical fertilizers and fossil fuels have significant environmental effects iriarte et al 2010 khanali et al 2018 nie et al 2010 reported that using nitrogen fixing plants in a crop rotation can be a suitable strategy to prevent excessive nitrogen consumption in the production system on the other hand an increase in resource use efficiency is a sustainable solution to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural production especially in the rice production systems brentrup et al 2004 3 3 final effects the final environmental impacts in continuous rice canola cultivation are shown in table 7 compared with control subsurface drainage systems reduced the negative environmental impacts on human health ecosystem quality climate change and resource depletion respectively by 5 43 10 53 3 40 12 87 7 23 15 83 and 2 20 11 42 in awd fd in the msd fd management the reductions were 11 17 22 33 17 19 29 84 19 58 30 95 and 11 63 25 01 respectively in human health the bilevel drainage system performed satisfactorily compared to other systems by reducing human effects by 10 and 22 compared with control under awd fd and msd fd respectively considering the ecosystem quality bilevel resulted in a maximum reduction in environmental pollution 335 5 pdf m2 yr than other drainage systems under awd fd however the d0 65l15 under msd fd showed the best performance by reducing pollution by 835 8 pdf m2 yr compared with control mainly due to reducing soil toxicity effects in general msd fd resulted in a better ecosystem quality index than awd fd from a climate change viewpoint awd fd had better performance than msd fd which further reduced the destructive effects of climate change in agriculture by 10 the bilevel drainage system showed the best performance through decreasing climate change impact by 235 4 and 583 7 kg co2 eq compared with control under awd fd and msd fd respectively the response of resource depletion to subsurface drainage systems was similar to climate change with the best results related to the bilevel under awd fd generally bilevel under awd fd and control under msd fd were the best and the worst drainage water management systems respectively the effectiveness of different subsurface drainage systems to decrease environmental effects compared with control was much more evident in the msd fd management than the awd fd management under both water managements the best response was related to bilevel followed by d0 9l30 d0 65l30 and d0 65l15 especially for the climate change index fig 8 shows the total negative environmental effects of water management strategies and different drainage systems the awd water management showed to be significantly better than msd under continuous rice canola cultivation the awd strategy reduced the final environmental effects by 6 9 compared with msd the highest effectiveness of the strategy was related to the climate change index with a 9 98 reduction compared to the msd method also the mean comparison of the effect of different drainage systems showed that the negative environmental effects of control were significantly higher than those in the subsurface drained area moreover among subsurface drainage systems d0 65l1530 and d0 65l15 had significantly more negative impacts than d0 9l30 and bilevel an increase in drain depth resulted in a reduction in the environmental effects of continuous rice canola cropping also the bilevel system was relatively more effective than the other subsurface drainage systems by reducing the environmental effects by an average of 19 1 compared to the control system therefore the bilevel under awd fd is recommended as the best drainage water management in paddy fields for continuous rice canola production which results in less environmental pollution per unit tone of crop production 4 conclusions in this study the environmental effects of rice canola cropping pattern development in the subsurface drained paddy fields were evaluated using the life cycle assessment concept subsurface drainage systems reduced environmental effects under both awd fd and msd fd compared with control bilevel the most effective drainage system reduced the emissions of co2 n2o and ch4 by 13 6 12 9 and 38 8 in awd fd and by 26 1 61 1 and 19 1 in msd fd compared with control subsurface drainage also decreased nitrate and phosphate leaching by 9 4 and 4 6 in awd fd and by 17 8 and 25 9 in msd fd respectively compared with control a 10 more reduction in heavy metals entrance into the soil under msd fd than awd fd reduced the final ecosystem quality index by 7 2 in msd fd but in terms of human health climate change and resource depletion awd fd had an average advantage of 8 7 over msd fd the findings indicated deeper drainage systems were more effective in diminishing negative environmental effects than shallower ones declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
