18710,in this work we combined macroscopic measurements of precipitate aggregation and chemical composition mn fe solids ratio with fe and mn k edge x ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the solids formed by co oxidation of fe ii and mn ii with o2 mno4 and hocl in the presence of groundwater ions in the absence of the strongly sorbing oxyanions phosphate p and silicate si and calcium ca o2 and hocl produced suspensions that aggregated rapidly whereas co oxidation of fe ii and mn ii by mno4 generated colloidally stable suspensions the aggregation of all suspensions decreased in p and si solutions but ca counteracted these oxyanion effects the speciation of oxidized fe and mn in the absence of p and si also depended on the oxidant with o2 producing mn iii incorporated lepidocrocite mn fe 0 01 0 02 mol mol hocl producing mn iii incorporated hydrous ferric oxide hfo mn fe 0 08 mol mol and mno4 producing poorly ordered mno2 and hfo mn fe 0 5 mol mol in general the presence of p and si decreased the crystallinity of the fe iii phase and increased the mn fe solids ratio which was found by mn k edge xas analysis to be due to an increase in surface bound mn ii by contrast ca decreased the mn fe solids ratio and decreased the fraction of mn ii associated with the solids suggesting that ca and mn ii compete for sorption sites based on these results we discuss strategies to optimize the design i e filter bed operation and chemical dosing of water treatment plants that aim to remove fe ii and mn ii by co oxidation graphical abstract image 1 keywords mn and fe removal drinking water filtration iron and manganese oxidation and precipitation groundwater treatment x ray absorption spectroscopy 1 introduction groundwater is treated to remove dissolved iron fe ii and manganese mn ii to avoid sedimentation in distribution pipelines and discoloration of treated water vries et al 2017 typical schemes at groundwater treatment plants consist of aeration followed by rapid sand filtration de moel et al 2006 aeration saturates the groundwater with dissolved oxygen o2 which facilitates oxidation and precipitation of fe and mn solids the fe and mn bearing precipitates accumulate in filters until backwashing is applied to dislodge the solids from the filtration media while o2 is often capable of oxidizing fe ii on the time scale of typical groundwater treatment o2 alone is ineffective at oxidizing mn ii to mn iii iv and as iii to as v the more easily removed arsenic species diem and stumm 1984 gude et al 2016 van beek et al 2012 to rapidly oxidize mn ii and as iii at water treatment plants stronger chemical oxidants such naocl or kmno4 can be used ahmad et al 2018 sorlini and gialdini 2010 strong oxidants are also used when high concentrations of fe ii are present in groundwater and rapid oxidation is desired allard et al 2013 knocke et al 1991 although chemical oxidants i e naocl and kmno4 can improve co oxidative removal of fe ii mn ii and as iii little is known about how different oxidants impact key properties of the solid end products including the structure and composition previous work has shown that the fe ii and mn ii oxidation rates alter the structure of the solid phase for example poorly ordered fe iii precipitates result from rapid fe ii oxidation by h2o2 and moderately crystalline lepidocrocite forms from slower fe ii oxidation by o2 van genuchten and pena 2017 voegelin et al 2010 these differences in crystallinity are important because poorly ordered fe iii oxyhydr oxides have a higher specific surface area than crystalline solids which would increase sorption of ions e g as per mass of fe added similarly poorly ordered mn iv oxides are favoured when microorganisms oxidize mn ii rapidly whereas mn iii oxides can form from slow surface catalyzed mn ii oxidation by o2 lan et al 2017 tebo et al 2005 however the co occurrence of fe ii and mn ii which is common in groundwater mcarthur et al 2012 can alter the pathways of co oxidation since strong fenton type oxidants generated from fe ii oxidation can react rapidly with reduced species including mn ii hug and leupin 2003 van genuchten and pena 2017 in addition to the type of chemical oxidant the structure of fe and mn bearing solids can also be altered by the presence of common groundwater ions such as silicate si phosphate p as and calcium ca by binding strongly to precipitate surfaces p and si oxyanions can inhibit crystal growth leading to poorly ordered solids kaegi et al 2010 senn et al 2017 moreover si and p oxyanions can decrease the particle surface charge which strongly influences particle aggregation and sedimentation efficiency sposito 2008 whereas ca can counteract the effects of p and si since the sorption reactivity and colloidal stability of fe and mn precipitates depend strongly on their structure and composition it is critical to investigate how structural properties of the precipitates are altered by oxidant type and solution composition in this work we combine macroscopic measurements of aggregation and sedimentation i e turbidity and filterability with fe and mn k edge x ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the solids formed by fe ii and mn ii co oxidation with o2 mno4 and hocl we perform batch fe ii and mn ii co oxidation experiments in solutions with systematically varied concentrations of as p si and ca we focus primarily on characterizing the speciation of fe and mn in this work but note that the redox and sorption behavior of as in identical experiments will be reported in a follow up study the knowledge generated in our investigation is critical to select the most effective oxidant in groundwater treatment considering the co removal of fe ii mn ii and as iii and the aggregation properties of the end products 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals were reagent grade the stock solutions for fe ii mn ii and hocl were prepared by dissolving 24 9 g l feso4 7h2o boom bv 1 8 g l mncl2 merck and 4 66 g l naocl acors organics in 100 ml oxygen free ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm purelab chorus veolia water the stock solutions for si hco3 nacl and

without any dilution for ph control during the experiments 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl solutions were used 2 2 oxidation and precipitation experiments experiments were performed with a 5 l glass reactor connected to a controller ez control applikon biotechnology for adjusting maintaining and logging bioxpertv2 software reaction parameters including the ph temperature oxidant supply and stirring speed fig 1 the experiments were carried out at ph 7 5 and 20 c with stirring set to 100 rpm fe ii and mn ii oxidation was initiated by dosing o2 kmno4 or naocl to anaerobic solutions that initially contained fe ii mn ii as iii si p and ca in different concentrations table 1 we note that naocl addition results in approximately 50 hocl and 50 ocl at ph 7 5 pkahocl 7 5 the range of ionic compositions studied in this work was derived from an analysis of groundwater quality in the netherlands ahmad et al 2015 for each oxidant the initial solutions in the reference experiments herein referred to as ref contained 90 μm fe ii 5 0 mg l 9 0 μm mn ii 0 5 mg l and 0 7 μm as iii 0 05 mg l without si p and ca in mn18 experiments the initial solution contained 18 μm mn instead of 9 μm mn the rest of the experiments are identified by the ions added in μm to the ref solution i e si150 consists of 150 μm si 90 μm fe ii 9 0 μm mn ii and 0 7 μm as iii all solutions also contained 2 5 mm nahco3 and 0 6 mm nacl to provide alkalinity and ionic strength for the o2 experiments the initial solutions were bubbled with air to reach saturation 9 mg o2 l for mno4 and hocl systems the doses of the kmno4 and naocl stocks were based on the combined stoichiometric demand of fe ii mn ii and as iii oxidation to produce fe iii mn iv and as v respectively chemical reactions are provided in the supplementary data ghurye and clifford 2001 the experimental procedure included i preparation of the initial solutions in the reaction vessel under anaerobic conditions ii dosing the oxidant o2 mno4 or hocl and allowing for oxidation and precipitation while stirring at 100 rpm and iii collection of suspension samples 30 min after oxidant addition which were filtered over 0 45 μm filters and stored for subsequent analysis a 30 min reaction interval was selected based on phreeqc simulations showing complete fe ii oxidation in the o2 system in 30 min fig s1 samples for aqueous and total fe and mn were collected in 100 ml plastic bottles that contained 0 5 ml of 65 hno3 and were stored at 4 c until analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo scientific xseries 2 icp ms thermo fisher scientific breda the netherlands at aqualab zuid b v in the netherlands the removal of mn and fe and the mn fe solid ratios mol mol were determined from the difference between the fe and mn concentrations of the initial and final filtered solutions solids generated in each experiment were also collected and reserved for xas analysis 2 3 settling experiments the aggregation and settling characteristics of the particles were studied by measuring the turbidity of the suspensions as a function of time using a 2100q portable turbidimeter hach usa following the addition of oxidant and 30 min of mixing the initial turbidity of the suspension was measured by removing an aliquot 5 cm below the water surface during mixing after the initial turbidity measurement the stirring was stopped and the suspension was allowed to settle by gravity a second turbidity measurement was made after 1 h of settling by removing another aliquot 5 cm below the water surface the turbidity measurement vessel was rinsed twice with ultrapure water and oxalic acid ph 1 3 between measurements 2 4 x ray absorption spectroscopy 2 4 1 data collection x ray absorption spectra at the fe and mn k edges were collected at room temperature at beamline 4 1 of the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource ssrl and the dubble beamline bm 26a of the european synchrotron radiation facility esrf the design of the dubble beamline is described by borsboom et al 1998 and nikitenko et al 2008 fe k edge xas data were recorded in transmission mode out to k of 13 å 1 mn k edge xas data were collected in transmission and fluorescence modes out to k of 12 å 1 with spectra of superior data quality selected for subsequent analysis fe 0 or mn 0 foils were used to calibrate the beam at 7112 ev or 6539 ev respectively spectra were aligned averaged and background subtracted using sixpack software webb 2005 following standard methods described previously van genuchten et al 2012 the k 3 weighted exafs spectra χ k k 3 were fourier transformed using a kaiser bessel window with dk of 3 å 1 typically over the k range 2 12 å 1 for the fe spectra and 2 10 5 å 1 for the mn spectra further details of the data collection are given in the supplementary data 2 4 2 data analysis the fe k edge exafs spectra were analyzed by principal component analysis pca and linear combination fits lcfs for the pca the itfa program suite rossberg et al 2003 scheinost et al 2006 was used to determine the number of independent components that reproduced the major variance of the data set based on minimizing the indicator ind function the lcfs were performed with the sixpack software webb 2005 using the exafs spectra of fe iii bearing standard minerals details on the synthesis of these standards e g lepidocrocite 2 line ferrihydrite oxyanion rich hydrous ferric oxide are reported elsewhere van genuchten et al 2018 van genuchten et al 2014a the fit derived fractions of the standards in each sample were normalized to one the mn k edge xanes spectra were analyzed by lcfs to determine the fraction of solid associated mn ii mn iii and mn iv sixpack software was used to perform the lcfs on the normalized xanes spectra with a fit range of 6530 6590 ev the mn k edge exafs spectra of representative samples were analyzed by shell by shell fits since the presence of multiple mn oxidation states in a single sample complicates the interpretation of shell by shell fits we applied this approach on samples that were determined by xanes lcfs to consist of primarily a single oxidation state i e mn ii mn iii or mn iv theoretical curve fits were performed in r δr space å using the sixpack software with algorithms based on the ifeffit library newville 2001 single scattering paths mn o mn mn were derived from the structure of birnessite mno2 lanson et al 2002 with theoretical phase and amplitude functions calculated using feff6 rehr et al 1992 because mn and fe have similar atomic numbers these backscattering atoms cannot be distinguished in shell by shell fits consequently the second shell fitting results for the mn data are reported as cnmn mn fe and rmn mn fe the goodness of fit was assessed based on the r factor which is the mean square difference between the fit and the data on a point by point basis r i datai fiti 2 i datai 2 a reasonable fit is considered to yield an r factor less than 0 05 kelly et al 2008 a similar shell by shell fitting approach was followed for select fe spectra further details regarding the xanes and exafs analyses are reporting in the supplementary data 3 results 3 1 macroscopic precipitate properties 3 1 1 settling and filterability in the o2 system the ref and mn18 experiments had an initial turbidity of 8 ntu fig 2 and a similarly low final turbidity of 3 ntu 70 turbidity decrease which indicates rapid flocculation and sedimentation these particles were highly filterable 99 by 0 45 μm filters pore size used to approximate filterable particles in rapid sand filters the addition of 150 750 μm si decreased the initial turbidity from 6 to 2 ntu resulting in translucent light yellow suspensions that were colloidally stable i e no difference in initial and final turbidity fig 2a and low filterability table 1 the addition of ca to the 350 and 750 μm si solutions increased the initial turbidity to match the ref o2 sample but the final turbidity was higher than the ref o2 sample in the p series 4 and 10 μm p did not alter significantly the initial or final turbidity relative to the ref o2 sample and the precipitates settled effectively 65 turbidity decrease however the 16 μm p experiment resulted in a colloidally stable suspension when 1000 μm ca was added to the 16 μm p solution the suspension had the highest initial turbidity in the o2 experiments 14 ntu with effective turbidity reduction 70 and good filterability 99 fe removed table 1 the settling behavior and filterability of the precipitates formed in the mno4 system fig 2b table 1 differed considerably from those in the o2 system the darker ref and mn18 suspensions formed in the mno4 system were colloidally stable having initial and final turbidity 5 5 ntu which contrasts the rapid settling of the ref o2 sample the 150 750 μm si samples in the mno4 system were also colloidally stable but the initial turbidity was slightly lower than the ref mno4 sample the addition of ca to the si solutions produced cloudy suspensions that settled more effectively 60 turbidity decrease than the ca si samples in the o2 system the 4 10 and 16 μm p samples in the mno4 system were all colloidally stable turbidity 3 to 5 ntu with low filterability table 1 similar to the o2 system p16 ca1000 sample in the mno4 system had a higher initial turbidity 8 ntu and improved particle settling 70 turbidity reduction and filterability 99 fe removed in the hocl system fig 2c the initial turbidity of all suspensions 4 ntu was systematically lower than the o2 or mno4 systems the ref and mn18 hocl suspensions were light yellow with visible flocs that settled quickly and were effectively filtered 90 despite their low initial turbidity the 150 750 μm si samples were colloidally stable similar to the o2 and mno4 systems when ca was added to the si solutions turbidity removal improved 20 but was lower than the ref hocl sample the hocl experiments in p solutions resembled the o2 system more than the mno4 system with 46 and 41 decreases in turbidity for p4 and p10 samples but only 8 for the p16 sample the impact of ca in p solutions was similar in all hocl o2 and mno4 systems with the p16 ca1000 sample displaying increased aggregation and sedimentation 40 turbidity decrease 3 2 mn fe solid ratios in the o2 system the precipitate mn fe ratio content was low 0 05 and varied with solution composition the mn fe ratio of the ref experiment was 0 01 mol mol which doubled to 0 02 mol mol in the mn18 experiment matching the doubled initial mn concentration the presence of si and p increased the precipitate mn content with the si150 and p16 samples having solids ratios of 0 03 mol mol and 0 05 mol mol respecitvely by contrast ca addition decreased the mn fe ratio the precipitate mn content was only 0 02 mol mol in the p16 ca1000 sample in mno4 system the mn fe ratio ranged from 0 5 to 0 55 with no significant trends in the presence of si p and ca the higher mn fe ratio relative to the o2 and hocl systems is attributed to the dosing of mno4 which increased the total mn concentration in the hocl system the precipitate mn fe ratio was higher than in the o2 system indicating more effective mn uptake the mn fe ratio of the ref and mn18 experiments was 0 08 and 0 18 mol mol which was near the total mn fe ratio dosed into solution the presence of si and p did not impact significantly the mn fe ratio in the hocl system table 1 with mn fe ratios of 0 08 mol mol for the si350 and p16 samples however ca addition decreased mn uptake leading to a mn fe solids ratio of 0 05 mol mol for the si350 ca500 and p16 ca1000 samples 3 3 fe k edge exafs spectroscopy principal component analysis pca of the fe k edge exafs spectra of the entire data set o2 mno4 and hocl systems revealed a significant decrease in the indicator function fig s2 with three independent components and a gradual plateau in the indicator function with increasing components based on the pca results and the experimental conditions we used three fe iii oxyhydr oxide standards in the linear combination fits lcfs of the experimental spectra lepidocrocite γ feooh 2 line ferrihydrite 2lfh and an oxyanion rich hydrous ferric oxide oxy hfo that was produced by fe ii oxidation in the presence of p and that contains no fe fe corner sharing bonds van genuchten et al 2014b the lcf output is overlain to the data in fig 4 and results of the lcfs of the experimental spectra using lepidocrocite 2lfh and oxy hfo are given fig 5 the ref and mn18 experiments in the o2 system consisted of dominantly lepidocrocite 85 the minor fraction 15 of oxy hfo determined in the lcfs of these samples likely arises from subtle differences in the structure of the lepidocrocite standard and the type of lepidocrocite formed in the experiments van genuchten et al 2014b voegelin et al 2010 lepidocrocite formation was largely inhibited in the presence of si with the lcfs of all si series samples returning fractions of 15 26 oxy hfo and 72 82 2lfh without clear trends in the fractions oxy hfo and 2lfh with increasing si or presence of ca in the p experiments the lcfs indicated the formation of lepidocrocite but its fraction depended on the p concentration i e p fe ratio increasing p from 4 to 16 μm decreased the lepidocrocite fraction from 64 to 27 which was balanced by an increase in oxy hfo from 16 to 37 the 2lfh fraction was stable at 30 the addition of ca to the p16 solution increased the lepidocrocite fraction from 27 to 55 at the expense of oxy hfo and 2lfh this impact of ca on the products of fe ii oxidation by o2 in the p solutions is consistent with the sequential formation of ca and p rich fe iii polymers voegelin et al 2010 which remove p from solution with p fe ratios near 1 followed by lepidocrocite formation with excess fe ii after p is removed from solution in contrast to the o2 experiments no sample in the mno4 system consisted of lepidocrocite regardless of solution composition the lcfs indicated poorly ordered fe iii precipitates formed in mno4 experiments which had average structures consistent with mixtures of 2lfh and oxy hfo 30 73 oxy hfo 25 69 2lfh increasing the si concentration from 150 to 750 μm increased the fraction of oxy hfo from 32 to 60 with 2lfh making up the remainder the fe iii precipitates formed from fe ii oxidation by mno4 in p solutions were similar to those in si solutions with the lcfs yielding mixtures of 2lfh and oxy hfo without clear trends in the presence of ca in the hocl system lepidocrocite was not detected in any sample the lcfs of the ref sample yielded 53 oxy hfo and 40 2lfh whereas the mn18 sample consisted of 40 oxy hfo and 54 2lfh fig 5 although p and si increased the fraction of poorly ordered fe iii precipitates in the o2 system the analogous trend was not observed in the hocl system no trends in the fractions of 2lfh and oxy rich hfo with increasing si or p were observed in the hocl samples comparing the lcfs across all oxidants i e o2 mno4 and hocl reveals that si and p impacted fe iii speciation in the o2 experiments more than in mno4 and hocl experiments 3 4 mn k edge xanes spectroscopy the mn k edge xanes lcfs of the ref o2 sample fig 6 table 2 indicated that mn iii was the dominant species 96 3 in the solids consistent with the absorption maximum near 6556 ev however the si150 sample displayed an absorption maximum at lower x ray energy 6552 ev and the lcfs indicated mn ii was the dominant species mn ii 75 2 mn iii 26 4 the trend in increased mn ii in the presence of oxyanions was also observed in the p16 experiment which consisted of 85 3 mn ii with mn iii making up the remainder when ca was added to the p16 electrolyte the lcfs indicated a significant decrease in solid associated mn ii 52 3 and an increase in mn iii 45 5 the presence of mn iv was not supported by the lcfs of any o2 samples the xanes spectra of the mno4 samples were largely independent of solution chemistry with 98 mn iv detected by the lcfs in all samples absorption maximum near 6558 ev while the lcfs returned a small fraction of mn iii in some samples 20 the standard deviation was nearly as high as the fit derived value table 2 no clear trends in the mn oxidation state with si p or ca were detected in the lcfs of the mno4 samples the presence of residual unreacted mn vii which has a prominent pre edge peak near 6541 ev was not supported by the xanes spectra co oxidation of fe ii and mn ii by hocl produced primarily mn iii in the ref and mn18 samples with a slight increase in the mn iv fraction from 15 10 in the ref sample to 23 11 in the mn18 sample the lcfs of the si150 sample indicated that mn iii remained the dominant solid phase mn species 85 at p concentrations of 4 and 16 μm the solid phase mn ii fraction increased from 9 5 to 41 4 when ca was added to the p16 solution the solid phase mn ii fraction decreased from 41 4 to 14 5 a similar decrease in mn ii fraction in favor of mn iii was observed in the o2 experiments when ca was added to the p16 solution 3 5 mn k edge exafs spectroscopy 3 5 1 o2 experiments in fig 7 the mn k edge exafs spectra of samples produced in the o2 mno4 and hocl experiments are shown alongside the spectra of mn standards the ref o2 sample which was found by the lcfs to be dominantly mn iii differed relative to the other spectra in fig 7 including the aqueous mn ii bixbyite α mn2o3 and δ mno2 standards in particular the first oscillation from 3 to 5 5 å 1 became a doublet which is not present in other mn iii bearing material e g groutite manganite feitnechtite manceau et al 2012 furthermore the next major peaks at 6 2 and 7 5 å1 in the ref o2 sample are out of phase with the standards which suggests a unique mn coordination environment in the presence of p and si the exafs oscillations for the o2 samples match more closely those of aqueous mn ii which is consistent with the xanes derived predominance of mn ii in these samples shell by shell fits of the fourier transformed mn k edge exafs spectrum of the ref o2 sample fig 8 table 3 returned an mn o interatomic distance rmn o of 1 93 0 02 å and an mn o coordination number cnmn o of 1 9 0 5 which is lower than the theoretical cn of 6 for octahedrally coordinated mn iii these fit derived rmn o and cnmn o values matched the first shell fits of bixbyite rmn o 1 92 0 02 å cnmn o 2 4 0 5 and are consistent jahn teller distorted mn iii octahedra fits of the second shell of the ref o2 sample resulted in a cnmn mn fe 2 8 1 1 and rmn mn fe 3 04 0 02 å this rmn mn fe is significantly shorter than the edge sharing mn mn bond in bixbyite table 3 and longer than the edge sharing mn mn bond in groutite wyckoff 1963 however the fit derived rmn mn fe value for this sample is in good agreement with the edge sharing fe fe bond length in the fe iii precipitates that formed in this sample i e lepidocrocite rfe fe 3 07 0 01 å table s1 3 5 2 mno4 experiments the mn k edge exafs spectra of mno4 samples were similar regardless solution composition with all samples resembling the exafs spectrum of the δ mno2 standard all experimental exafs spectra contained the characteristic staircase feature from 4 to 6 å 1 indicative of mno2 minerals manceau et al 2012 which implies that mn ii and fe ii co oxidation by mno4 in a variety of solutions leads to solid phase mn in a mno2 like bonding environment shell by shell fits of the ref mno4 sample which contained 10 mn iii table 2 indicated a mn o coordination shell of cnmn o 5 2 0 9 and rmn o 1 91 0 01 å these fit derived values are in excellent agreement with the first shell fits of the δ mno2 standard table 3 and are representative of mn iv in octahedral coordination the second shell fit of the ref mno4 sample returned values of cnmn mn fe 3 2 0 4 and rmn mn fe 2 89 0 01 å which also matches the fits δ mno2 standard table 3 and is consistent with edge sharing mno6 octahedra furthermore this fit derived rmn mn fe value is considerably shorter than the fit derived rmn mn fe of the ref o2 sample and is also shorter than the edge sharing fe fe bond in fe iii oxyhydr oxide minerals manceau and combes 1988 interestingly the shell by shell fits of the ref mno4 sample and the mno4 sample generated in the highest oxyanion solution i e si750 ca2500 were identical within fit derived standard errors table 3 this result suggests that co occurring oxyanions do not modify the structure of co precipitated mno2 solids as much as fe iii precipitates which is attributed to the lower affinity of oxyanions for mno2 surfaces than fe iii oxyhydr oxides van genuchten and peña 2016a 3 5 3 hocl experiments the exafs spectra of the ref and mn18 samples in the hocl system which consisted of primarily mn iii table 3 were nearly identical both ref and mn18 spectra displayed a split oscillation from 3 to 5 å 1 which is similar to that of the ref o2 sample but the split in this oscillation was less prominent in the hocl samples the ref and mn18 hocl samples also exhibited an asymmetric oscillation near 6 5 å 1 that was less pronounced or absent from the exafs spectra of other samples and standards fig 7 in the presence of p and si some features in the exafs spectra changed including the disappearance of the assymetric oscillation near 6 5 å but the first oscillation from 3 to 5 å 1 was still split the similarity of key exafs features across all hocl samples regardless of the presence e g si150 p4 or absence ref mn18 of oxyanions is consistent with the xanes lcfs which identified mn iii as the predominant mn oxidation state in all hocl samples table 2 shell by shell fits of the fourier transformed exafs spectrum of the ref hocl sample table 3 revealed a first shell mn o coordination environment similar to the ref o2 sample with cnmn o 2 4 0 4 and rmn o 1 91 0 01 å which is consistent with jahn teller distorted mn iii octahedra fits of the second shell of the ref hocl sample returned values of 1 7 0 4 for cnmn mn fe and 3 01 0 02 å for rmn mn fe similar to the o2 system the second shell fits of the ref hocl sample produced a rmn mn fe value that is shorter than the edge sharing mn mn bond in mn iii bearing minerals however the rmn mn fe for the hocl sample is in good agreement with the fe fe bond length for edge sharing feo6 octahedra in fe iii precipitates that formed in this sample i e hydrous ferric oxide rfe fe 3 05 0 01 å table s1 4 discussion 4 1 effect of oxidant and solution chemistry on fe iii speciation and particle aggregation 4 1 1 fe ii oxidation in o2 mno4 and hocl ref experiments comparison of the ref experiments across all oxidants shows that fe ii and mn ii co oxidation by o2 and hocl produced suspensions that aggregated rapidly and that were separated by gravitational settling or filtering easily whereas the mno4 ref experiment generated a colloidally stable suspension however fe iii speciation differed between ref o2 and ref hocl experiments with o2 producing lepidocrocite and both hocl and mno4 producing poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates these differences in aggregation and fe iii speciation with oxidant can be explained by the different fe ii reaction rates with o2 hocl and mno4 and the different end products of each reaction the fe ii oxidation rate by o2 depends strongly on ph van beek et al 2016 van beek et al 2012 vries et al 2017 but at circumneutral ph is orders of magnitude lower than hocl and mno4 ghurye and clifford 2001 knocke et al 1991 stumm and morgan 1996 although our experiments were designed to allow for complete fe ii oxidation in the o2 experiments fe ii reactions with o2 are not instantaneous which ensures that freshly oxidized fe iii precursors form in the presence of fe ii aqueous fe ii catalyzes the rapid transformation of poorly ordered fe iii precipitates into lepidocrocite which was the dominant fe iii phase of the ref o2 experiment pedersen et al 2005 by contrast the reaction rate of hocl and mno4 with fe ii is high enough that aqueous fe ii is too unstable to catalyze the transformation of freshly formed fe iii to lepidocrocite leading to the persistence of poorly ordered fe iii precipitates although fe iii speciation was similar in the ref hocl and mno4 experiments the ref mno4 solids contained a major fraction of mno2 that did not form in the o2 and hocl experiments the presence of mno2 likely enhances the colloidal stability of the mno4 samples because of the much lower point of zero charge of mno2 2 3 compared to lepidocrocite and poorly ordered fe iii precipitates 7 8 sposito 2008 at circumneutral ph suspensions containing mno2 will have a strong negative charge preventing aggregation whereas suspensions of fe iii precipitates will be near the optimum ph to induce aggregation sposito 2008 4 1 2 impact of ionic composition solution chemistry was found to alter both the suspension stability and fe iii speciation with different impacts depending on the fe ii oxidant and ionic composition the fe iii speciation in the o2 samples was impacted the most by solution composition but similar trends were observed in the mno4 and hocl experiments the presence of oxyanions in the o2 samples decreased particle aggregation and resulted in a transition from lepidocrocite to poorly ordered fe iii precipitates oxyanions such as si and p bind strongly to fe iii precipitate surfaces during fe iii polymerization which modifies two key properties of the suspension first by binding strongly to crystal growth sites on the fe iii precipitate surface oxyanions inhibit the formation of crystalline fe iii minerals i e lepidocrocite leading to the persistence of poorly ordered fe iii precipitates with a large specific surface area van genuchten et al 2014b voegelin et al 2010 second sorption of oxyanions leads to negatively charged fe iii precipitate surfaces even in the case of si which is uncharged in solution circumneutral ph delaire et al 2016 kanematsu et al 2013 therefore oxyanion sorption generates particles with highly negative surface charge that are less likely to aggregate both consequences of co occurring oxyanions during fe iii precipitation i e changes in suspension aggregation and fe iii speciation were observed in the o2 experiments these effects were less pronounced in the mno4 experiments since the ref mno4 suspension was already colloidally stable and consisted of poorly ordered fe iii precipitates even in the absence of si and p the presence of ca can counteract some of the oxyanion effects particularly with respect to particle surface charge ca addition enhanced aggregation i e settling and filterability in nearly every o2 hocl and mno4 experiment with stronger impact in p solutions than si the pronounced impact of ca in p solutions is attributed to the formation of ca o p linkages during fe iii polymerization that enhance particle aggregation by neutralizing more effectively the negative surface charge of p rich fe iii precipitates senn et al 2015 van genuchten et al 2014a voegelin et al 2010 the presence of ca was also important to enhancing the aggregation of mno4 suspensions which is explained by positively charged ca neutralizing the negatively charged mno2 produced in the mno4 experiments 4 2 behavior of mn ii during co oxidation with fe ii 4 2 1 mn ii removal in o2 mno4 and hocl ref experiments a visual representation of the structure and composition of the solids formed in the ref experiments is given in fig 9 the ref o2 mno4 and hocl experiments were performed in solutions with the least ionic complexity and form the baseline for comparing mn ii removal in the simulated groundwater solutions in the ref o2 experiment the mn fe solids ratio was 0 01 mol mol i e 10 mn ii removal and the xanes lcfs indicated solid phase mn was dominantly mn iii shell by shell fits of the ref o2 sample were consistent with a first shell mn iii o coordination environment and a second shell that consisted of mn mn fe atomic pairs at r 3 04 0 02 å this r value matches that of edge sharing feo6 octahedra in the fe iii precipitates formed in this sample table s1 therefore mn ii removal in the ref o2 experiment likely occurs via mn ii oxidation to mn iii by the reactive fenton type oxidants produced during fe ii oxidation by o2 o2 fe iv and subsequent partial incorporation into the resulting fe iii precipitate this mn ii removal mechanism has been observed in experiments that dosed fe ii slowly by fe 0 electrolysis into air saturated solutions of mn ii allowing fe ii and mn ii co oxidize by o2 van genuchten and pena 2017 the ref mno4 experiment had a high mn fe solids ratio of 0 5 mol mol which matches the total mn fe ratio dosed into the initial solution the xanes lcfs of the ref mno4 sample indicated mn was present as mn iv the line shape and position of the mn k edge exafs spectrum and the shell by shell fitting output of the ref mno4 sample indicated an mn coordination environment similar to the δ mno2 standard the formation of nanoscale mno2 by reaction of mn ii and mno4 has been well documented in many studies knocke et al 1991 lee et al 2011 and our results suggest that the presence of fe ii and other background ions in the ref mno4 experiment did not alter this reaction pathway effective removal of approximately 80 of the initial mn ii was observed in the ref hocl experiment leading to a mn fe solids ratio of 0 08 mol mol which was significantly higher than the ref o2 sample the xanes lcfs of the ref hocl sample indicated that solid phase mn was dominantly mn iii similar to the o2 system the shell by shell fits of the ref hocl sample were consistent with a first shell mn iii o coordination environment and second shell that consisted of mn mn fe atomic pairs at an r value 3 01 0 02 å that is not found in mn iii oxyhydr oxide minerals however this r value is similar to that of the edge sharing fe octahedra in the fe iii precipitates that formed in this sample 3 05 0 01 å table s1 therefore we propose that mn ii removal in the ref hocl experiment proceeds by a single electron transfer from mn ii to mn iii with mn iii stabilized by partial incorporation into co precipitating fe iii oxyhydr oxides while a similar mn ii removal pathway has been documented for mn ii and fe ii co oxidation by h2o2 this pathway is inconsistent with previous research investigating mn ii removal by chlorination which report the formation of mn iv species allard et al 2013 hao et al 1991 in our experiments the precipitation of fe iii during mn ii oxidation likely stabilizes the initial mn iii product by incorporation into the solid phase which prevents subsequent mn iii oxidation to mn iv 4 2 2 impact of ionic composition a visual representation of the impact of oxyanions and bivalent cations on the structure and composition of the precipitates formed by fe ii and mn ii co oxidation is given in fig 9 solution composition modified the uptake and removal mechanism of mn ii in many experiments with the most pronounced impacts in the o2 and hocl systems based on the xanes lcfs and mn k edge exafs spectra mn ii was removed by reaction with mno4 to form nanoscale mno2 in every experiment in the mno4 system regardless of solution composition however in the o2 and hocl experiments si and p increased the fraction of solid phase mn ii for example whereas 5 mn ii was present in the ref o2 and hocl samples the p16 samples in the o2 and hocl systems consisted of 85 3 and 41 4 mn ii respectively the impact of si was weaker than p but still increased the mn ii fraction in the si150 sample in the o2 system to 75 2 furthermore the increased fraction of sorbed mn ii in the o2 experiments coincided with an increase in mn fe solids ratio particularly in the p experiment mn feref 0 01 mol mol mn fep16 0 05 mol mol these results indicate that p and si to a lesser extent can enhance mn ii sorption when mn ii oxidation is incomplete the enhanced mn ii removal in the presence of oxyanions can be explained by the interaction between positively charged mn ii and negatively charged surfaces of oxyanion rich fe iii precipitates the more pronounced impact of p relative to si could arise from direct mn ii o p bonding on the fe iii precipitate surface i e ternary complexes analogous to ca o p linkages in contrast to the effect of oxyanions the presence of ca in si and p solutions systematically decreased the fraction of solid phase mn ii in both o2 and hocl experiments the impact of ca was most pronounced in the p16 solutions with decreases in the mn ii fraction from 85 3 to 20 4 in the o2 system and from 41 4 and 14 5 in the hocl system the ca induced decrease in sorbed mn ii was coupled to a decrease in the mn fe solids ratio fig 3 which suggests that ca can compete effectively with mn ii for sorption sites especially in the case of p rich fe iii precipitates this conclusion is consistent with the similar ionic potential charge ionic radius of mn ii ipmn ii 24 and ca ipca 20 ions which suggests similar sorption reactivity between mn ii and ca 4 3 conclusions and implications for water treatment we found that the composition of water and the identity of the oxidant strongly determines the macroscopic and molecular scale characteristics of fe and mn bearing precipitates generated by fe ii and mn ii co oxidation the higher mn fe ratio of the precipitates produced with mno4 or hocl indicates that the mn removal mechanism will differ between the typical aeration rapid sand filtration type groundwater treatment systems that rely on bacteria and surface catalysts for mn ii removal bruins et al 2015 and the ones that use strong oxidants such as kmno4 and naocl in the prior case mn removal will take place deeper in the filter bed whereas mn is expected to precipitate in the supernatant storage with kmno4 and naocl resulting in accumulation of mn bearing solids in the top sand filter layer our study shows that the addition of ca counteracts the negative effect of oxyanions and enhances the settling and filterability of fe and mn bearing precipitates thus water treatment utilities that plan to implement softening at fe mn removal plants should consider placing softening reactors after fe mn removal to avoid colloidally stable suspensions arising from solutions low in bivalent cations if colloidally stable suspensions are unavoidable low pressure membrane systems microfiltration ultrafiltration may replace rapid sand filters for effective removal of colloidal precipitates but the fouling of membranes will be a critical issue precipitates can foul the membranes in different ways depending on particle size particle sizes larger than the membrane pores will deposit on membrane surfaces resulting in cake layer formation which is often easily reversible floris et al 2016 however smaller particles can deposit in the membrane internal structure resulting in undesirable pore entrapment and pore narrowing which severely decreases the flux over time irreversible fouling with respect to contaminant removal during treatment the formation of mno2 by mno4 addition should not be overlooked the characterization data in the mno4 experiments indicated that the mn solids were structurally similar to δ mno2 a nanoscale mno2 mineral these types of mn iv oxides have remarkable reactivity with respect to sorption of a wide variety of toxic heavy metals e g cd ii pb ii cu ii ni ii peña et al 2015 pena et al 2010 villalobos 2015 for example the pb mn solids ratio for δ mno2 can reach 0 4 mol mol villalobos et al 2005 which is partly due to highly reactive mn iv vacancies in mno2 sheets lanson et al 2002 in our study mno4 was investigated primarily because it improves the kinetics of fe ii mn ii and as iii oxidation however our results suggest that fe ii oxidation by mno4 and the production of mixtures of fe iii precipitates and mno2 would be ideal for concurrent treatment of as iii and heavy metals this result is particularly important for the co removal of as iii and cd ii which can often occur simultaneously in polluted environments perera et al 2016 since cd ii removal by fe iii precipitates is much less effective than mno2 van genuchten and peña 2016b acknowledgement this research is co

18710,in this work we combined macroscopic measurements of precipitate aggregation and chemical composition mn fe solids ratio with fe and mn k edge x ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the solids formed by co oxidation of fe ii and mn ii with o2 mno4 and hocl in the presence of groundwater ions in the absence of the strongly sorbing oxyanions phosphate p and silicate si and calcium ca o2 and hocl produced suspensions that aggregated rapidly whereas co oxidation of fe ii and mn ii by mno4 generated colloidally stable suspensions the aggregation of all suspensions decreased in p and si solutions but ca counteracted these oxyanion effects the speciation of oxidized fe and mn in the absence of p and si also depended on the oxidant with o2 producing mn iii incorporated lepidocrocite mn fe 0 01 0 02 mol mol hocl producing mn iii incorporated hydrous ferric oxide hfo mn fe 0 08 mol mol and mno4 producing poorly ordered mno2 and hfo mn fe 0 5 mol mol in general the presence of p and si decreased the crystallinity of the fe iii phase and increased the mn fe solids ratio which was found by mn k edge xas analysis to be due to an increase in surface bound mn ii by contrast ca decreased the mn fe solids ratio and decreased the fraction of mn ii associated with the solids suggesting that ca and mn ii compete for sorption sites based on these results we discuss strategies to optimize the design i e filter bed operation and chemical dosing of water treatment plants that aim to remove fe ii and mn ii by co oxidation graphical abstract image 1 keywords mn and fe removal drinking water filtration iron and manganese oxidation and precipitation groundwater treatment x ray absorption spectroscopy 1 introduction groundwater is treated to remove dissolved iron fe ii and manganese mn ii to avoid sedimentation in distribution pipelines and discoloration of treated water vries et al 2017 typical schemes at groundwater treatment plants consist of aeration followed by rapid sand filtration de moel et al 2006 aeration saturates the groundwater with dissolved oxygen o2 which facilitates oxidation and precipitation of fe and mn solids the fe and mn bearing precipitates accumulate in filters until backwashing is applied to dislodge the solids from the filtration media while o2 is often capable of oxidizing fe ii on the time scale of typical groundwater treatment o2 alone is ineffective at oxidizing mn ii to mn iii iv and as iii to as v the more easily removed arsenic species diem and stumm 1984 gude et al 2016 van beek et al 2012 to rapidly oxidize mn ii and as iii at water treatment plants stronger chemical oxidants such naocl or kmno4 can be used ahmad et al 2018 sorlini and gialdini 2010 strong oxidants are also used when high concentrations of fe ii are present in groundwater and rapid oxidation is desired allard et al 2013 knocke et al 1991 although chemical oxidants i e naocl and kmno4 can improve co oxidative removal of fe ii mn ii and as iii little is known about how different oxidants impact key properties of the solid end products including the structure and composition previous work has shown that the fe ii and mn ii oxidation rates alter the structure of the solid phase for example poorly ordered fe iii precipitates result from rapid fe ii oxidation by h2o2 and moderately crystalline lepidocrocite forms from slower fe ii oxidation by o2 van genuchten and pena 2017 voegelin et al 2010 these differences in crystallinity are important because poorly ordered fe iii oxyhydr oxides have a higher specific surface area than crystalline solids which would increase sorption of ions e g as per mass of fe added similarly poorly ordered mn iv oxides are favoured when microorganisms oxidize mn ii rapidly whereas mn iii oxides can form from slow surface catalyzed mn ii oxidation by o2 lan et al 2017 tebo et al 2005 however the co occurrence of fe ii and mn ii which is common in groundwater mcarthur et al 2012 can alter the pathways of co oxidation since strong fenton type oxidants generated from fe ii oxidation can react rapidly with reduced species including mn ii hug and leupin 2003 van genuchten and pena 2017 in addition to the type of chemical oxidant the structure of fe and mn bearing solids can also be altered by the presence of common groundwater ions such as silicate si phosphate p as and calcium ca by binding strongly to precipitate surfaces p and si oxyanions can inhibit crystal growth leading to poorly ordered solids kaegi et al 2010 senn et al 2017 moreover si and p oxyanions can decrease the particle surface charge which strongly influences particle aggregation and sedimentation efficiency sposito 2008 whereas ca can counteract the effects of p and si since the sorption reactivity and colloidal stability of fe and mn precipitates depend strongly on their structure and composition it is critical to investigate how structural properties of the precipitates are altered by oxidant type and solution composition in this work we combine macroscopic measurements of aggregation and sedimentation i e turbidity and filterability with fe and mn k edge x ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the solids formed by fe ii and mn ii co oxidation with o2 mno4 and hocl we perform batch fe ii and mn ii co oxidation experiments in solutions with systematically varied concentrations of as p si and ca we focus primarily on characterizing the speciation of fe and mn in this work but note that the redox and sorption behavior of as in identical experiments will be reported in a follow up study the knowledge generated in our investigation is critical to select the most effective oxidant in groundwater treatment considering the co removal of fe ii mn ii and as iii and the aggregation properties of the end products 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals were reagent grade the stock solutions for fe ii mn ii and hocl were prepared by dissolving

without any dilution for ph control during the experiments 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl solutions were used 2 2 oxidation and precipitation experiments experiments were performed with a 5 l glass reactor connected to a controller ez control applikon biotechnology for adjusting maintaining and logging bioxpertv2 software reaction parameters including the ph temperature oxidant supply and stirring speed fig 1 the experiments were carried out at ph 7 5 and 20 c with stirring set to 100 rpm fe ii and mn ii oxidation was initiated by dosing o2 kmno4 or naocl to anaerobic solutions that initially contained fe ii mn ii as iii si p and ca in different concentrations table 1 we note that naocl addition results in approximately 50 hocl and 50 ocl at ph 7 5 pkahocl 7 5 the range of ionic compositions studied in this work was derived from an analysis of groundwater quality in the netherlands ahmad et al 2015 for each oxidant the initial solutions in the reference experiments herein referred to as ref contained 90 μm fe ii 5 0 mg l 9 0 μm mn ii 0 5 mg l and 0 7 μm as iii 0 05 mg l without si p and ca in mn18 experiments the initial solution contained 18 μm mn instead of 9 μm mn the rest of the experiments are identified by the ions added in μm to the ref solution i e si150 consists of 150 μm si 90 μm fe ii 9 0 μm mn ii and 0 7 μm as iii all solutions also contained 2 5 mm nahco3 and 0 6 mm nacl to provide alkalinity and ionic strength for the o2 experiments the initial solutions were bubbled with air to reach saturation 9 mg o2 l for mno4 and hocl systems the doses of the kmno4 and naocl stocks were based on the combined stoichiometric demand of fe ii mn ii and as iii oxidation to produce fe iii mn iv and as v respectively chemical reactions are provided in the supplementary data ghurye and clifford 2001 the experimental procedure included i preparation of the initial solutions in the reaction vessel under anaerobic conditions ii dosing the oxidant o2 mno4 or hocl and allowing for oxidation and precipitation while stirring at 100 rpm and iii collection of suspension samples 30 min after oxidant addition which were filtered over 0 45 μm filters and stored for subsequent analysis a 30 min reaction interval was selected based on phreeqc simulations showing complete fe ii oxidation in the o2 system in 30 min fig s1 samples for aqueous and total fe and mn were collected in 100 ml plastic bottles that contained 0 5 ml of 65 hno3 and were stored at 4 c until analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo scientific xseries 2 icp ms thermo fisher scientific breda the netherlands at aqualab zuid b v in the netherlands the removal of mn and fe and the mn fe solid ratios mol mol were determined from the difference between the fe and mn concentrations of the initial and final filtered solutions solids generated in each experiment were also collected and reserved for xas analysis 2 3 settling experiments the aggregation and settling characteristics of the particles were studied by measuring the turbidity of the suspensions as a function of time using a 2100q portable turbidimeter hach usa following the addition of oxidant and 30 min of mixing the initial turbidity of the suspension was measured by removing an aliquot 5 cm below the water surface during mixing after the initial turbidity measurement the stirring was stopped and the suspension was allowed to settle by gravity a second turbidity measurement was made after 1 h of settling by removing another aliquot 5 cm below the water surface the turbidity measurement vessel was rinsed twice with ultrapure water and oxalic acid ph 1 3 between measurements 2 4 x ray absorption spectroscopy 2 4 1 data collection x ray absorption spectra at the fe and mn k edges were collected at room temperature at beamline 4 1 of the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource ssrl and the dubble beamline bm 26a of the european synchrotron radiation facility esrf the design of the dubble beamline is described by borsboom et al 1998 and nikitenko et al 2008 fe k edge xas data were recorded in transmission mode out to k of 13 å 1 mn k edge xas data were collected in transmission and fluorescence modes out to k of 12 å 1 with spectra of superior data quality selected for subsequent analysis fe 0 or mn 0 foils were used to calibrate the beam at 7112 ev or 6539 ev respectively spectra were aligned averaged and background subtracted using sixpack software webb 2005 following standard methods described previously van genuchten et al 2012 the k 3 weighted exafs spectra χ k k 3 were fourier transformed using a kaiser bessel window with dk of 3 å 1 typically over the k range 2 12 å 1 for the fe spectra and 2 10 5 å 1 for the mn spectra further details of the data collection are given in the supplementary data 2 4 2 data analysis the fe k edge exafs spectra were analyzed by principal component analysis pca and linear combination fits lcfs for the pca the itfa program suite rossberg et al 2003 scheinost et al 2006 was used to determine the number of independent components that reproduced the major variance of the data set based on minimizing the indicator ind function the lcfs were performed with the sixpack software webb 2005 using the exafs spectra of fe iii bearing standard minerals details on the synthesis of these standards e g lepidocrocite 2 line ferrihydrite oxyanion rich hydrous ferric oxide are reported elsewhere van genuchten et al 2018 van genuchten et al 2014a the fit derived fractions of the standards in each sample were normalized to one the mn k edge xanes spectra were analyzed by lcfs to determine the fraction of solid associated mn ii mn iii and mn iv sixpack software was used to perform the lcfs on the normalized xanes spectra with a fit range of 6530 6590 ev the mn k edge exafs spectra of representative samples were analyzed by shell by shell fits since the presence of multiple mn oxidation states in a single sample complicates the interpretation of shell by shell fits we applied this approach on samples that were determined by xanes lcfs to consist of primarily a single oxidation state i e mn ii mn iii or mn iv theoretical curve fits were performed in r δr space å using the sixpack software with algorithms based on the ifeffit library newville 2001 single scattering paths mn o mn mn were derived from the structure of birnessite mno2 lanson et al 2002 with theoretical phase and amplitude functions calculated using feff6 rehr et al 1992 because mn and fe have similar atomic numbers these backscattering atoms cannot be distinguished in shell by shell fits consequently the second shell fitting results for the mn data are reported as cnmn mn fe and rmn mn fe the goodness of fit was assessed based on the r factor which is the mean square difference between the fit and the data on a point by point basis r i datai fiti 2 i datai 2 a reasonable fit is considered to yield an r factor less than 0 05 kelly et al 2008 a similar shell by shell fitting approach was followed for select fe spectra further details regarding the xanes and exafs analyses are reporting in the supplementary data 3 results 3 1 macroscopic precipitate properties 3 1 1 settling and filterability in the o2 system the ref and mn18 experiments had an initial turbidity of 8 ntu fig 2 and a similarly low final turbidity of 3 ntu 70 turbidity decrease which indicates rapid flocculation and sedimentation these particles were highly filterable 99 by 0 45 μm filters pore size used to approximate filterable particles in rapid sand filters the addition of 150 750 μm si decreased the initial turbidity from 6 to 2 ntu resulting in translucent light yellow suspensions that were colloidally stable i e no difference in initial and final turbidity fig 2a and low filterability table 1 the addition of ca to the 350 and 750 μm si solutions increased the initial turbidity to match the ref o2 sample but the final turbidity was higher than the ref o2 sample in the p series 4 and 10 μm p did not alter significantly the initial or final turbidity relative to the ref o2 sample and the precipitates settled effectively 65 turbidity decrease however the 16 μm p experiment resulted in a colloidally stable suspension when 1000 μm ca was added to the 16 μm p solution the suspension had the highest initial turbidity in the o2 experiments 14 ntu with effective turbidity reduction 70 and good filterability 99 fe removed table 1 the settling behavior and filterability of the precipitates formed in the mno4 system fig 2b table 1 differed considerably from those in the o2 system the darker ref and mn18 suspensions formed in the mno4 system were colloidally stable having initial and final turbidity 5 5 ntu which contrasts the rapid settling of the ref o2 sample the 150 750 μm si samples in the mno4 system were also colloidally stable but the initial turbidity was slightly lower than the ref mno4 sample the addition of ca to the si solutions produced cloudy suspensions that settled more effectively 60 turbidity decrease than the ca si samples in the o2 system the 4 10 and 16 μm p samples in the mno4 system were all colloidally stable turbidity 3 to 5 ntu with low filterability table 1 similar to the o2 system p16 ca1000 sample in the mno4 system had a higher initial turbidity 8 ntu and improved particle settling 70 turbidity reduction and filterability 99 fe removed in the hocl system fig 2c the initial turbidity of all suspensions 4 ntu was systematically lower than the o2 or mno4 systems the ref and mn18 hocl suspensions were light yellow with visible flocs that settled quickly and were effectively filtered 90 despite their low initial turbidity the 150 750 μm si samples were colloidally stable similar to the o2 and mno4 systems when ca was added to the si solutions turbidity removal improved 20 but was lower than the ref hocl sample the hocl experiments in p solutions resembled the o2 system more than the mno4 system with 46 and 41 decreases in turbidity for p4 and p10 samples but only 8 for the p16 sample the impact of ca in p solutions was similar in all hocl o2 and mno4 systems with the p16 ca1000 sample displaying increased aggregation and sedimentation 40 turbidity decrease 3 2 mn fe solid ratios in the o2 system the precipitate mn fe ratio content was low 0 05 and varied with solution composition the mn fe ratio of the ref experiment was 0 01 mol mol which doubled to 0 02 mol mol in the mn18 experiment matching the doubled initial mn concentration the presence of si and p increased the precipitate mn content with the si150 and p16 samples having solids ratios of 0 03 mol mol and 0 05 mol mol respecitvely by contrast ca addition decreased the mn fe ratio the precipitate mn content was only 0 02 mol mol in the p16 ca1000 sample in mno4 system the mn fe ratio ranged from 0 5 to 0 55 with no significant trends in the presence of si p and ca the higher mn fe ratio relative to the o2 and hocl systems is attributed to the dosing of mno4 which increased the total mn concentration in the hocl system the precipitate mn fe ratio was higher than in the o2 system indicating more effective mn uptake the mn fe ratio of the ref and mn18 experiments was 0 08 and 0 18 mol mol which was near the total mn fe ratio dosed into solution the presence of si and p did not impact significantly the mn fe ratio in the hocl system table 1 with mn fe ratios of 0 08 mol mol for the si350 and p16 samples however ca addition decreased mn uptake leading to a mn fe solids ratio of 0 05 mol mol for the si350 ca500 and p16 ca1000 samples 3 3 fe k edge exafs spectroscopy principal component analysis pca of the fe k edge exafs spectra of the entire data set o2 mno4 and hocl systems revealed a significant decrease in the indicator function fig s2 with three independent components and a gradual plateau in the indicator function with increasing components based on the pca results and the experimental conditions we used three fe iii oxyhydr oxide standards in the linear combination fits lcfs of the experimental spectra lepidocrocite γ feooh 2 line ferrihydrite 2lfh and an oxyanion rich hydrous ferric oxide oxy hfo that was produced by fe ii oxidation in the presence of p and that contains no fe fe corner sharing bonds van genuchten et al 2014b the lcf output is overlain to the data in fig 4 and results of the lcfs of the experimental spectra using lepidocrocite 2lfh and oxy hfo are given fig 5 the ref and mn18 experiments in the o2 system consisted of dominantly lepidocrocite 85 the minor fraction 15 of oxy hfo determined in the lcfs of these samples likely arises from subtle differences in the structure of the lepidocrocite standard and the type of lepidocrocite formed in the experiments van genuchten et al 2014b voegelin et al 2010 lepidocrocite formation was largely inhibited in the presence of si with the lcfs of all si series samples returning fractions of 15 26 oxy hfo and 72 82 2lfh without clear trends in the fractions oxy hfo and 2lfh with increasing si or presence of ca in the p experiments the lcfs indicated the formation of lepidocrocite but its fraction depended on the p concentration i e p fe ratio increasing p from 4 to 16 μm decreased the lepidocrocite fraction from 64 to 27 which was balanced by an increase in oxy hfo from 16 to 37 the 2lfh fraction was stable at 30 the addition of ca to the p16 solution increased the lepidocrocite fraction from 27 to 55 at the expense of oxy hfo and 2lfh this impact of ca on the products of fe ii oxidation by o2 in the p solutions is consistent with the sequential formation of ca and p rich fe iii polymers voegelin et al 2010 which remove p from solution with p fe ratios near 1 followed by lepidocrocite formation with excess fe ii after p is removed from solution in contrast to the o2 experiments no sample in the mno4 system consisted of lepidocrocite regardless of solution composition the lcfs indicated poorly ordered fe iii precipitates formed in mno4 experiments which had average structures consistent with mixtures of 2lfh and oxy hfo 30 73 oxy hfo 25 69 2lfh increasing the si concentration from 150 to 750 μm increased the fraction of oxy hfo from 32 to 60 with 2lfh making up the remainder the fe iii precipitates formed from fe ii oxidation by mno4 in p solutions were similar to those in si solutions with the lcfs yielding mixtures of 2lfh and oxy hfo without clear trends in the presence of ca in the hocl system lepidocrocite was not detected in any sample the lcfs of the ref sample yielded 53 oxy hfo and 40 2lfh whereas the mn18 sample consisted of 40 oxy hfo and 54 2lfh fig 5 although p and si increased the fraction of poorly ordered fe iii precipitates in the o2 system the analogous trend was not observed in the hocl system no trends in the fractions of 2lfh and oxy rich hfo with increasing si or p were observed in the hocl samples comparing the lcfs across all oxidants i e o2 mno4 and hocl reveals that si and p impacted fe iii speciation in the o2 experiments more than in mno4 and hocl experiments 3 4 mn k edge xanes spectroscopy the mn k edge xanes lcfs of the ref o2 sample fig 6 table 2 indicated that mn iii was the dominant species 96 3 in the solids consistent with the absorption maximum near 6556 ev however the si150 sample displayed an absorption maximum at lower x ray energy 6552 ev and the lcfs indicated mn ii was the dominant species mn ii 75 2 mn iii 26 4 the trend in increased mn ii in the presence of oxyanions was also observed in the p16 experiment which consisted of 85 3 mn ii with mn iii making up the remainder when ca was added to the p16 electrolyte the lcfs indicated a significant decrease in solid associated mn ii 52 3 and an increase in mn iii 45 5 the presence of mn iv was not supported by the lcfs of any o2 samples the xanes spectra of the mno4 samples were largely independent of solution chemistry with 98 mn iv detected by the lcfs in all samples absorption maximum near 6558 ev while the lcfs returned a small fraction of mn iii in some samples 20 the standard deviation was nearly as high as the fit derived value table 2 no clear trends in the mn oxidation state with si p or ca were detected in the lcfs of the mno4 samples the presence of residual unreacted mn vii which has a prominent pre edge peak near 6541 ev was not supported by the xanes spectra co oxidation of fe ii and mn ii by hocl produced primarily mn iii in the ref and mn18 samples with a slight increase in the mn iv fraction from 15 10 in the ref sample to 23 11 in the mn18 sample the lcfs of the si150 sample indicated that mn iii remained the dominant solid phase mn species 85 at p concentrations of 4 and 16 μm the solid phase mn ii fraction increased from 9 5 to 41 4 when ca was added to the p16 solution the solid phase mn ii fraction decreased from 41 4 to 14 5 a similar decrease in mn ii fraction in favor of mn iii was observed in the o2 experiments when ca was added to the p16 solution 3 5 mn k edge exafs spectroscopy 3 5 1 o2 experiments in fig 7 the mn k edge exafs spectra of samples produced in the o2 mno4 and hocl experiments are shown alongside the spectra of mn standards the ref o2 sample which was found by the lcfs to be dominantly mn iii differed relative to the other spectra in fig 7 including the aqueous mn ii bixbyite α mn2o3 and δ mno2 standards in particular the first oscillation from 3 to 5 5 å 1 became a doublet which is not present in other mn iii bearing material e g groutite manganite feitnechtite manceau et al 2012 furthermore the next major peaks at 6 2 and 7 5 å1 in the ref o2 sample are out of phase with the standards which suggests a unique mn coordination environment in the presence of p and si the exafs oscillations for the o2 samples match more closely those of aqueous mn ii which is consistent with the xanes derived predominance of mn ii in these samples shell by shell fits of the fourier transformed mn k edge exafs spectrum of the ref o2 sample fig 8 table 3 returned an mn o interatomic distance rmn o of 1 93 0 02 å and an mn o coordination number cnmn o of 1 9 0 5 which is lower than the theoretical cn of 6 for octahedrally coordinated mn iii these fit derived rmn o and cnmn o values matched the first shell fits of bixbyite rmn o 1 92 0 02 å cnmn o 2 4 0 5 and are consistent jahn teller distorted mn iii octahedra fits of the second shell of the ref o2 sample resulted in a cnmn mn fe 2 8 1 1 and rmn mn fe 3 04 0 02 å this rmn mn fe is significantly shorter than the edge sharing mn mn bond in bixbyite table 3 and longer than the edge sharing mn mn bond in groutite wyckoff 1963 however the fit derived rmn mn fe value for this sample is in good agreement with the edge sharing fe fe bond length in the fe iii precipitates that formed in this sample i e lepidocrocite rfe fe 3 07 0 01 å table s1 3 5 2 mno4 experiments the mn k edge exafs spectra of mno4 samples were similar regardless solution composition with all samples resembling the exafs spectrum of the δ mno2 standard all experimental exafs spectra contained the characteristic staircase feature from 4 to 6 å 1 indicative of mno2 minerals manceau et al 2012 which implies that mn ii and fe ii co oxidation by mno4 in a variety of solutions leads to solid phase mn in a mno2 like bonding environment shell by shell fits of the ref mno4 sample which contained 10 mn iii table 2 indicated a mn o coordination shell of cnmn o 5 2 0 9 and rmn o 1 91 0 01 å these fit derived values are in excellent agreement with the first shell fits of the δ mno2 standard table 3 and are representative of mn iv in octahedral coordination the second shell fit of the ref mno4 sample returned values of cnmn mn fe 3 2 0 4 and rmn mn fe 2 89 0 01 å which also matches the fits δ mno2 standard table 3 and is consistent with edge sharing mno6 octahedra furthermore this fit derived rmn mn fe value is considerably shorter than the fit derived rmn mn fe of the ref o2 sample and is also shorter than the edge sharing fe fe bond in fe iii oxyhydr oxide minerals manceau and combes 1988 interestingly the shell by shell fits of the ref mno4 sample and the mno4 sample generated in the highest oxyanion solution i e si750 ca2500 were identical within fit derived standard errors table 3 this result suggests that co occurring oxyanions do not modify the structure of co precipitated mno2 solids as much as fe iii precipitates which is attributed to the lower affinity of oxyanions for mno2 surfaces than fe iii oxyhydr oxides van genuchten and peña 2016a 3 5 3 hocl experiments the exafs spectra of the ref and mn18 samples in the hocl system which consisted of primarily mn iii table 3 were nearly identical both ref and mn18 spectra displayed a split oscillation from 3 to 5 å 1 which is similar to that of the ref o2 sample but the split in this oscillation was less prominent in the hocl samples the ref and mn18 hocl samples also exhibited an asymmetric oscillation near 6 5 å 1 that was less pronounced or absent from the exafs spectra of other samples and standards fig 7 in the presence of p and si some features in the exafs spectra changed including the disappearance of the assymetric oscillation near 6 5 å but the first oscillation from 3 to 5 å 1 was still split the similarity of key exafs features across all hocl samples regardless of the presence e g si150 p4 or absence ref mn18 of oxyanions is consistent with the xanes lcfs which identified mn iii as the predominant mn oxidation state in all hocl samples table 2 shell by shell fits of the fourier transformed exafs spectrum of the ref hocl sample table 3 revealed a first shell mn o coordination environment similar to the ref o2 sample with cnmn o 2 4 0 4 and rmn o 1 91 0 01 å which is consistent with jahn teller distorted mn iii octahedra fits of the second shell of the ref hocl sample returned values of 1 7 0 4 for cnmn mn fe and 3 01 0 02 å for rmn mn fe similar to the o2 system the second shell fits of the ref hocl sample produced a rmn mn fe value that is shorter than the edge sharing mn mn bond in mn iii bearing minerals however the rmn mn fe for the hocl sample is in good agreement with the fe fe bond length for edge sharing feo6 octahedra in fe iii precipitates that formed in this sample i e hydrous ferric oxide rfe fe 3 05 0 01 å table s1 4 discussion 4 1 effect of oxidant and solution chemistry on fe iii speciation and particle aggregation 4 1 1 fe ii oxidation in o2 mno4 and hocl ref experiments comparison of the ref experiments across all oxidants shows that fe ii and mn ii co oxidation by o2 and hocl produced suspensions that aggregated rapidly and that were separated by gravitational settling or filtering easily whereas the mno4 ref experiment generated a colloidally stable suspension however fe iii speciation differed between ref o2 and ref hocl experiments with o2 producing lepidocrocite and both hocl and mno4 producing poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates these differences in aggregation and fe iii speciation with oxidant can be explained by the different fe ii reaction rates with o2 hocl and mno4 and the different end products of each reaction the fe ii oxidation rate by o2 depends strongly on ph van beek et al 2016 van beek et al 2012 vries et al 2017 but at circumneutral ph is orders of magnitude lower than hocl and mno4 ghurye and clifford 2001 knocke et al 1991 stumm and morgan 1996 although our experiments were designed to allow for complete fe ii oxidation in the o2 experiments fe ii reactions with o2 are not instantaneous which ensures that freshly oxidized fe iii precursors form in the presence of fe ii aqueous fe ii catalyzes the rapid transformation of poorly ordered fe iii precipitates into lepidocrocite which was the dominant fe iii phase of the ref o2 experiment pedersen et al 2005 by contrast the reaction rate of hocl and mno4 with fe ii is high enough that aqueous fe ii is too unstable to catalyze the transformation of freshly formed fe iii to lepidocrocite leading to the persistence of poorly ordered fe iii precipitates although fe iii speciation was similar in the ref hocl and mno4 experiments the ref mno4 solids contained a major fraction of mno2 that did not form in the o2 and hocl experiments the presence of mno2 likely enhances the colloidal stability of the mno4 samples because of the much lower point of zero charge of mno2 2 3 compared to lepidocrocite and poorly ordered fe iii precipitates 7 8 sposito 2008 at circumneutral ph suspensions containing mno2 will have a strong negative charge preventing aggregation whereas suspensions of fe iii precipitates will be near the optimum ph to induce aggregation sposito 2008 4 1 2 impact of ionic composition solution chemistry was found to alter both the suspension stability and fe iii speciation with different impacts depending on the fe ii oxidant and ionic composition the fe iii speciation in the o2 samples was impacted the most by solution composition but similar trends were observed in the mno4 and hocl experiments the presence of oxyanions in the o2 samples decreased particle aggregation and resulted in a transition from lepidocrocite to poorly ordered fe iii precipitates oxyanions such as si and p bind strongly to fe iii precipitate surfaces during fe iii polymerization which modifies two key properties of the suspension first by binding strongly to crystal growth sites on the fe iii precipitate surface oxyanions inhibit the formation of crystalline fe iii minerals i e lepidocrocite leading to the persistence of poorly ordered fe iii precipitates with a large specific surface area van genuchten et al 2014b voegelin et al 2010 second sorption of oxyanions leads to negatively charged fe iii precipitate surfaces even in the case of si which is uncharged in solution circumneutral ph delaire et al 2016 kanematsu et al 2013 therefore oxyanion sorption generates particles with highly negative surface charge that are less likely to aggregate both consequences of co occurring oxyanions during fe iii precipitation i e changes in suspension aggregation and fe iii speciation were observed in the o2 experiments these effects were less pronounced in the mno4 experiments since the ref mno4 suspension was already colloidally stable and consisted of poorly ordered fe iii precipitates even in the absence of si and p the presence of ca can counteract some of the oxyanion effects particularly with respect to particle surface charge ca addition enhanced aggregation i e settling and filterability in nearly every o2 hocl and mno4 experiment with stronger impact in p solutions than si the pronounced impact of ca in p solutions is attributed to the formation of ca o p linkages during fe iii polymerization that enhance particle aggregation by neutralizing more effectively the negative surface charge of p rich fe iii precipitates senn et al 2015 van genuchten et al 2014a voegelin et al 2010 the presence of ca was also important to enhancing the aggregation of mno4 suspensions which is explained by positively charged ca neutralizing the negatively charged mno2 produced in the mno4 experiments 4 2 behavior of mn ii during co oxidation with fe ii 4 2 1 mn ii removal in o2 mno4 and hocl ref experiments a visual representation of the structure and composition of the solids formed in the ref experiments is given in fig 9 the ref o2 mno4 and hocl experiments were performed in solutions with the least ionic complexity and form the baseline for comparing mn ii removal in the simulated groundwater solutions in the ref o2 experiment the mn fe solids ratio was 0 01 mol mol i e 10 mn ii removal and the xanes lcfs indicated solid phase mn was dominantly mn iii shell by shell fits of the ref o2 sample were consistent with a first shell mn iii o coordination environment and a second shell that consisted of mn mn fe atomic pairs at r 3 04 0 02 å this r value matches that of edge sharing feo6 octahedra in the fe iii precipitates formed in this sample table s1 therefore mn ii removal in the ref o2 experiment likely occurs via mn ii oxidation to mn iii by the reactive fenton type oxidants produced during fe ii oxidation by o2 o2 fe iv and subsequent partial incorporation into the resulting fe iii precipitate this mn ii removal mechanism has been observed in experiments that dosed fe ii slowly by fe 0 electrolysis into air saturated solutions of mn ii allowing fe ii and mn ii co oxidize by o2 van genuchten and pena 2017 the ref mno4 experiment had a high mn fe solids ratio of 0 5 mol mol which matches the total mn fe ratio dosed into the initial solution the xanes lcfs of the ref mno4 sample indicated mn was present as mn iv the line shape and position of the mn k edge exafs spectrum and the shell by shell fitting output of the ref mno4 sample indicated an mn coordination environment similar to the δ mno2 standard the formation of nanoscale mno2 by reaction of mn ii and mno4 has been well documented in many studies knocke et al 1991 lee et al 2011 and our results suggest that the presence of fe ii and other background ions in the ref mno4 experiment did not alter this reaction pathway effective removal of approximately 80 of the initial mn ii was observed in the ref hocl experiment leading to a mn fe solids ratio of 0 08 mol mol which was significantly higher than the ref o2 sample the xanes lcfs of the ref hocl sample indicated that solid phase mn was dominantly mn iii similar to the o2 system the shell by shell fits of the ref hocl sample were consistent with a first shell mn iii o coordination environment and second shell that consisted of mn mn fe atomic pairs at an r value 3 01 0 02 å that is not found in mn iii oxyhydr oxide minerals however this r value is similar to that of the edge sharing fe octahedra in the fe iii precipitates that formed in this sample 3 05 0 01 å table s1 therefore we propose that mn ii removal in the ref hocl experiment proceeds by a single electron transfer from mn ii to mn iii with mn iii stabilized by partial incorporation into co precipitating fe iii oxyhydr oxides while a similar mn ii removal pathway has been documented for mn ii and fe ii co oxidation by h2o2 this pathway is inconsistent with previous research investigating mn ii removal by chlorination which report the formation of mn iv species allard et al 2013 hao et al 1991 in our experiments the precipitation of fe iii during mn ii oxidation likely stabilizes the initial mn iii product by incorporation into the solid phase which prevents subsequent mn iii oxidation to mn iv 4 2 2 impact of ionic composition a visual representation of the impact of oxyanions and bivalent cations on the structure and composition of the precipitates formed by fe ii and mn ii co oxidation is given in fig 9 solution composition modified the uptake and removal mechanism of mn ii in many experiments with the most pronounced impacts in the o2 and hocl systems based on the xanes lcfs and mn k edge exafs spectra mn ii was removed by reaction with mno4 to form nanoscale mno2 in every experiment in the mno4 system regardless of solution composition however in the o2 and hocl experiments si and p increased the fraction of solid phase mn ii for example whereas 5 mn ii was present in the ref o2 and hocl samples the p16 samples in the o2 and hocl systems consisted of 85 3 and 41 4 mn ii respectively the impact of si was weaker than p but still increased the mn ii fraction in the si150 sample in the o2 system to 75 2 furthermore the increased fraction of sorbed mn ii in the o2 experiments coincided with an increase in mn fe solids ratio particularly in the p experiment mn feref 0 01 mol mol mn fep16 0 05 mol mol these results indicate that p and si to a lesser extent can enhance mn ii sorption when mn ii oxidation is incomplete the enhanced mn ii removal in the presence of oxyanions can be explained by the interaction between positively charged mn ii and negatively charged surfaces of oxyanion rich fe iii precipitates the more pronounced impact of p relative to si could arise from direct mn ii o p bonding on the fe iii precipitate surface i e ternary complexes analogous to ca o p linkages in contrast to the effect of oxyanions the presence of ca in si and p solutions systematically decreased the fraction of solid phase mn ii in both o2 and hocl experiments the impact of ca was most pronounced in the p16 solutions with decreases in the mn ii fraction from 85 3 to 20 4 in the o2 system and from 41 4 and 14 5 in the hocl system the ca induced decrease in sorbed mn ii was coupled to a decrease in the mn fe solids ratio fig 3 which suggests that ca can compete effectively with mn ii for sorption sites especially in the case of p rich fe iii precipitates this conclusion is consistent with the similar ionic potential charge ionic radius of mn ii ipmn ii 24 and ca ipca 20 ions which suggests similar sorption reactivity between mn ii and ca 4 3 conclusions and implications for water treatment we found that the composition of water and the identity of the oxidant strongly determines the macroscopic and molecular scale characteristics of fe and mn bearing precipitates generated by fe ii and mn ii co oxidation the higher mn fe ratio of the precipitates produced with mno4 or hocl indicates that the mn removal mechanism will differ between the typical aeration rapid sand filtration type groundwater treatment systems that rely on bacteria and surface catalysts for mn ii removal bruins et al 2015 and the ones that use strong oxidants such as kmno4 and naocl in the prior case mn removal will take place deeper in the filter bed whereas mn is expected to precipitate in the supernatant storage with kmno4 and naocl resulting in accumulation of mn bearing solids in the top sand filter layer our study shows that the addition of ca counteracts the negative effect of oxyanions and enhances the settling and filterability of fe and mn bearing precipitates thus water treatment utilities that plan to implement softening at fe mn removal plants should consider placing softening reactors after fe mn removal to avoid colloidally stable suspensions arising from solutions low in bivalent cations if colloidally stable suspensions are unavoidable low pressure membrane systems microfiltration ultrafiltration may replace rapid sand filters for effective removal of colloidal precipitates but the fouling of membranes will be a critical issue precipitates can foul the membranes in different ways depending on particle size particle sizes larger than the membrane pores will deposit on membrane surfaces resulting in cake layer formation which is often easily reversible floris et al 2016 however smaller particles can deposit in the membrane internal structure resulting in undesirable pore entrapment and pore narrowing which severely decreases the flux over time irreversible fouling with respect to contaminant removal during treatment the formation of mno2 by mno4 addition should not be overlooked the characterization data in the mno4 experiments indicated that the mn solids were structurally similar to δ mno2 a nanoscale mno2 mineral these types of mn iv oxides have remarkable reactivity with respect to sorption of a wide variety of toxic heavy metals e g cd ii pb ii cu ii ni ii peña et al 2015 pena et al 2010 villalobos 2015 for example the pb mn solids ratio for δ mno2 can reach 0 4 mol mol villalobos et al 2005 which is partly due to highly reactive mn iv vacancies in mno2 sheets lanson et al 2002 in our study mno4 was investigated primarily because it improves the kinetics of fe ii mn ii and as iii oxidation however our results suggest that fe ii oxidation by mno4 and the production of mixtures of fe iii precipitates and mno2 would be ideal for concurrent treatment of as iii and heavy metals this result is particularly important for the co removal of as iii and cd ii which can often occur simultaneously in polluted environments perera et al 2016 since cd ii removal by fe iii precipitates is much less effective than mno2 van genuchten and peña 2016b acknowledgement this research is co

m401 to daphnia magna straus was greater than that of the parent compound indicating that ethiprole degradation should be carefully monitored in given the environmental risk posed by its degradation products graphical abstract image 1 keywords ethiprole hydrolysis photolysis soil degradation degradation products 1 introduction many types of synthetic insecticides have been widely used all over the world to control a variety of pests in agricultural production fenner et al 2013 however it is well known that overuse of insecticides can be hazardous for humans and the environment while pests also develop resistance to pesticides battershill et al 2004 bermúdez couso et al 2011 everett and matheson 2010 seiber and kleinschmidt 2011 it is important to understand how pesticides behave in the environment whether they persist in soils leach into the water or degrade the following exposure to light water or microbial catabolism to form other potentially harmful compounds the molecular weights of the pesticide degradation products are generally smaller than that of the parent compounds which may increase the likelihood of mobilization into surface and groundwater thus posing a significant potential threat to the non target organisms fava et al 2005 herrero hernández et al 2013 jin et al 2010 studies of pesticide degradation and determination of the residual content of the main transformation products under different conditions are needed to predict the chemical lifetime in the environment and to accurately assess potential biological impacts ethiprole is a new 1 phenylpyrazole insecticide widely used on pests of rice and stored grains due to its efficacy against a broad spectrum of sucking and chewing insects and having strong systemic activity in plants caboni et al 2003 ethiprole works at the gaba receptor as noncompetitive blockers of the gaba gated chloride channel and the functional group of ethiprole is 1 phenylpyrazoles zhao et al 2010 ethiprole is very similar to fipronil in chemical structure photochemistry metabolic activity and insecticidal activity caboni et al 2003 since ethiprole is effective against a broad spectrum of insects it has a large number of uses in agricultural production in china guosheng 2004 ethiprole is currently registered for use on tea in japan and china and is registered on rice in brazil indonesia japan thailand and vietnam usepa 2011 hu et al reported that ethiprole was stable in water and showed varying degrees of toxicity for organisms in the environment hu et al 2012 some researchers reported that ethiprole had high toxicity to mysid shrimps and meanwhile had probable carcinogenicity usepa 2011 ethiprole is relatively toxic to bees by ingestion or topical application

moderate persistence in the soil with a dt50 of 50 days iupac 2018 thus far the study of the environmental behavior of ethiprole has been focused on its degradation in soil and water the establishment of analytical methods for tracking residual pesticide as well as some research into its toxicity for non target organisms only one paper so far has investigated the transformation products of ethiprole by using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and high performance liquid chromatography hplc caboni et al 2003 and only studied the transformation products formed by photodecomposition the radioisotope tracer technique is an important research tool in the study of a pesticide degradation pathway product composition mechanisms of action combined residue and its environmental risk smith et al 1995 however it is difficult to obtain the isotope labeled compounds because of the high cost and complicated process to synthesize them with the 14c marker labeled on the original drug and high toxicity for the human body li et al 2010 meanwhile the study of degradation kinetics of residues has largely been the focus for research into pesticide degradation processes chen et al 2012 li et al 2013 madsen et al 2015 in addition many of these studies are unpersuasive given their reliance on low resolution mass spectrometry for identification of degradation products fuhrmann et al 2014 karas et al 2015 phugare et al 2013 in recent years with the development and improvement of high resolution mass spectrometry technology qualitative analyses of compounds

this study is focused on the environmental degradation behavior of ethiprole and identification of its degradation products in different environments an effective method was developed to quantify ethiprole residue and identify its degradation products in soil and water different environmental factors such as ph temperature and degradation mode such as hydrolysis or photolysis were tested to compare the differences in patterns and degradation products in addition the non target toxicity of the ethiprole degradation products was also evaluated for three non target model organisms 2

and ethiprole degradation in soil the test soil without any detectable ethiprole or pesticides was collected from harbin heilongjiang province it was stored in a cool place and air dried physical and chemical properties of the soil are shown in table 1 test soil was weighed in 1000 g increments and ultrapure water was added to raise the soil moisture content up to 40 of full water saturation 56 5 of soil in northeast china all samples were then incubated at a constant temperature 25 1 c and humidity without light for 14 d to provide soil microbiota enough time to degrade ethiprole incubation experiments were carried out with the ethiprole using 250 ml brown aerobe jar covered with sterile cotton plugs and brown anaerobe jar respectively 20 g soil was first spiked with 200 μl stock solution in acetone containing approximately 2 mg ethiprole and the resulting mixture was stirred for 5 min the spiked soils were then allowed to air dry for 10 min before the remaining soil 180 g was added the resulting combination was mixed thoroughly for another 15 min which yielded a fortification level of 10 mg kg in aerobic conditions the water content of the soil samples was adjusted to about 60 of the field holding capacity w w and maintained by frequently adding deionized water each jar was opened weekly to let the air in to maintain its aerobic conditions during the incubation the control was the same treatment but no ethiprole added in anaerobic conditions the concentration of ethiprole was also 10 mg kg after preparing samples using the same protocol as with the aerobic assays an appropriate amount of sterilized ultrapure water was added to each brown jar until a water layer of 2 cm formed on top of the soil layer to form a relatively anaerobic condition jars were again plugged with cotton and placed in a vacuum desiccator the air in the vacuum drier was drawn out and replaced with nitrogen gas to facilitate the development and maintenance of anaerobic conditions this nitrogen replacement process has repeated three times the control was the same treatment but no ethiprole added all samples were cultured at 25 c in stable temperature and humidity under dark conditions and removed at regular timepoints of 0 h 2 d 4 d 6 d 8 d 16 d 30 d 50 d 64 d 80 d and 92 d for each sample 20 g was collected and the experiment was set up in 3 groups with a

then diluted with water to 1000 ml the ph value was corrected after sterilization the acetonitrile solutions 10 mg l were prepared by using each buffer solution of ph 5 7 and 9 respectively and ultra pure water ph 7 then the aqueous solution of ethiprole was put into the quartz photolysis tube with a tightly closed cap the tubes were placed in a specialized tank after the photolysis apparatus was calibrated for testing a xenon lamp light source wavelength 290 nm 800 nm was used for exposure to ultraviolet light 100 10 μw cm2 uv intensity was 365 nm and the reaction temperature was 25 1 c during the test water samples were collected periodically with a minimum of 7 time points and the change in ethiprole concentration for each buffered water sample was measured until the photolytic rate reached above 90 simultaneously we set up a control test under a dark condition with foil with 3 replicates for each treatment during the photolysis test other light sources were minimized or eliminated to reduce the impact on the accuracy of results 2 2 3 hydrolysis samples the sterile buffer solutions and ultrapure water were used as solvents to prepare a 10 mg l ethiprole solution on a sterile workbench after stirring well the samples were placed in brown reagent bottles and sealed these bottles were incubated at a constant temperature of either 15 25 or 35 c in the dark water samples were collected regularly for more than 10 time points and the residue of ethiprole was determined each treatment was performed with 3 replicates 2 3 sample treatment the soil samples the different buffers and water samples were each weighed to 10 0 g separately accurate to 0 1 g placed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes after a 2 min vortex followed by a 30 min quiescence at room temperature 5 ml of ultra pure water was added only to the soil then 10 ml of 1 formic acid acetonitrile was added and vortexed for 5 min following that 3 g of anhydrous mgso4 and 2 g of nacl were added to the soil while 5 g of anhydrous mgso4 and 7 g of nacl were added to the buffers and water and vortexed for 2 min all tubes were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min for each sample 1 5 ml supernatant was placed in a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube including 50 mg psa 150 mg anhydrous mgso4 then vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm after filtration through a 0 22 m organic membrane the

monitored by checking mass accuracy before use the chromatography and sensitivity were checked during data acquisition for every sample and it was re tuned or re calibrated if mass error exceeded 2 ppm background signals were identified by analysis of lab control samples deionized water and acetonitrile and method blanks then those signals from the control were substracted from ms ms analysis regardless of peak intensity by comparison of the samples with an ethiprole control sample metabolynx software was used to select all characteristic peaks of metabolites transformation products and analyze its elemental composition a spiked recovery assay was conducted at the three fortified concentration levels to evaluate the performance of the method the series of ethiprole standard solutions were tested three times 2 6 acute toxicity experiment the test for acute toxicity by three ethiprole degradation products in brachydanio rerio and pseudokirchneriella subcapitata was performed according to the standard test method oecd 201 the test of acute toxicity to daphnia magna was performed according to the standard test method oecd 202 the three degradation products m401 m399 and m312 were synthesized by shanghai simr biotech co ltd shanghai china the 96 h ec 50 values of daphnia magna straus exposed by m401 m399 m312 and ethiprole for 48 were analyzed by sas 9 4 with anova and their means compared by lsd the significant level was set to p 0 05 2 7 data processing for most of the pesticides in soil degradation followed a model of first order kinetics the total reaction can be divided into two stages namely the rapid degradation of the initial stage and the lag phase of the later stage the equation of degradation kinetics for ethiprole in soil and the half life of degradation dt50 are as follows ct c0 e kt t1 2 ln2 k 0 693 k 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis method validation the series of ethiprole standard solution were injection tested for three times the results showed that the ethiprole exhibits a good linear relationship in the range of 0 01 10 mg l and the regression equation is y 31560x 1055 2 r2 0 9994 the recoveries experiments of 0 01 0 1 1 0 and 10 0 mg kg in blank soil different buffer solutions and water samples were carried out by the recycling method above and five replicates were set for each spiked level the average recoveries and relative standard deviations rsds of ethiprole in different buffer solutions and water were obtained according to the above detection methods the average recovery of ethiprole in soil matrix is 84 2 105 5 and the variation coefficient is 3 9 7 8 ethiprole in different aqueous solution recovery is 80 2 98 5 with the variation coefficient of 2 1 6 2 according to the instructions of dg sanco 12495 2011 recoveries between 70 and 120 and rsd 20 the test method of this experiment completely meets the requirements of the method s accuracy precision and sensitivity in pesticide residue analysis 3 2 degradation behavior of ethiprole in different conditions 3 2 1 soil degradation the degradation of ethiprole in soil follows a first order kinetic equation the degradation kinetic parameters and half life results are shown in fig 1 the degradation half life of ethiprole in soil from northeast china soil is 20 4 d under aerobic conditions and 11 9 d under anaerobic conditions the degradation rate of ethiprole in water accumulated anaerobic conditions is significantly faster than that under aerobic conditions there are many factors affecting the rate of ethiprole degradation in soil we found the driving factors behind ethiprole degradation are microbial action and hydrolysis when cultured in a dark incubator and therefore microbial populations are likely responsible for the rapid degradation of ethiprole under anaerobic conditions in field soil other studies have also found that most organochlorine pesticides have faster dechlorination rates under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions tabak et al 1997 it is also possible that in conditions of water accumulation the adsorption capacity of soil for ethiprole is decreased and ethiprole is thus more prone to hydrolysis in water on the soil surface our experimental results are not the same as data showing that ethiprole has a degradation half life in paddy soil under anaerobic conditions of 2 8 d 3 2 d as reported by shang zishuai et al shang et al 2010 torniainen et al 1996 degradation half life of ethiprole reported by liang xuyang under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in black soil from northeast china is 46 2 h and 25 7 h respectively which is also not the same as our results in terms of duration but shows the same pattern of slower degradation in aerobic conditions 27 this longer half life duration may be caused by differences in the physical and chemical properties between the two soils specifically the black soil may contain more organic matter providing more accessible carbon substrate for microbes additionally differences in degradation rates can be attributed to the different pre culture incubation times resulting in enrichment for different microbial populations with variation in the abundance of species that have the metabolic capability for degradation of ethiprole in soil it is also possible that there were great differences in acclimation to anaerobic conditions for the microbes 3 2 2 hydrolysis this study shows that hydrolysis of ethiprole varies across a range of ph values and temperatures the experimental data show significant differences in the degree of ethiprole hydrolysis between acid and alkali conditions degradation is slow under acidic and neutral conditions with only 8 2 hydrolyzed in ph 5 buffer solution 16 7 hydrolyzed in ph 7 buffer and only 15 6 in ultrapure water ph 7 after 87 days of incubation at 25 c however the hydrolyzed portion reached 41 6 in a ph 9 buffer solution after incubation at 25 c for 87 days therefore ethiprole is ostensibly stable under acidic conditions whereas it tends to hydrolyze faster with an increase in alkalinity temperature also affects the hydrolysis rate of ethiprole to some extent as temperature increases the hydrolysis rate is also accelerated guo min et al tested the effect of different ph on the degradation rate of fipronil and found that the degradation of fipronil accelerated with increasing alkalinity of the buffer solution which is a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction for fipronil nucleophilic groups water or oh attack electrophilic groups c p and s among other atoms so that fipronil degrades rapidly in alkaline conditions torniainen et al 1996 the results of this work show that ethiprole also degrades rapidly under alkaline conditions due to the similar chemical structures of ethiprole and fipronil it is likely that during the process of hydrolysis ethiprole may also undergo bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction 3 2 3 photolysis we measured the photochemical degradation of ethiprole in aqueous solution using a xenon lamp artificial light source the results are shown in fig 2 the photodegradation rate of ethiprole in different ph buffer solutions again follows first order kinetics under the same light conditions the photolytic rate of ethiprole in neutral and alkaline solutions is significantly faster than that in pure water and acidic solutions the half life of ethiprole subjected to photolysis in ph 7 and ph 9 buffer solutions was 4 17 h and 3 69 h respectively while the half life in ph 5 buffer or ultrapure water was 17 33 h and 9 90 h respectively the photolysis rates in neutral and alkaline conditions are close and both of which are 4 5 times faster than in acidic conditions the most plausible explanation of these data is that the ph value affects the reaction of oh free radicals and reactive oxygen species with ethyl nitrile in the solution it may also be the case that ethiprole is more susceptible to hydrolysis in higher ph buffer solutions thus resulting in the acceleration of photolysis in alkaline conditions 25 3 3 structure identification of ethiprole transformation products the transformation products of ethiprole were detected by uhplc q tof ms and the data acquired by mse were analyzed using masslynx software by comparison of the samples with an ethiprole control sample metabolynx software was used to select all characteristic peaks of transformation products and analyze its elemental composition metabolynx xs training was used to infer the structure of putative transformation products finally the mass fragment software was used to perform ion fragment alignment in high energy ion channels among the identified transformation products eleven degradation products of ethiprole were detected in water and soil samples nine of which were previously reported caboni et al 2003 usepa 2015 and two new transformation products m401 and m312 which were detected for the first time in this work the three new degradation products were synthesized based on their putative structure for further study for their toxicity and comparison of their mse spectra information on each of the eleven degradation products is provided in table 2 the functional group of ethiprole is 1 phenylpyrazoles most of the transformation products have 1 phenylpyrazoles so their activities may be consistent with ethiprole s mode of action m230 and m282 don t have the 1 phenylpyrazoles so the activities of m230 and m282 may be different from ethiprole s mode of action one novel compound was identified with an m z of 401 characteristic ion peaks at 401 and 255 and a retention time of 3 02 min the chromatogram and mass spectra derived by esi of this compound are shown in fig 3 according to its characteristic ion peaks and fragmentation characteristics described in a previous report of fipronil it is presumed to be 1 2 6 dichloro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 cyano 4 ethylsulfonyl 5 aminopyrazole m401 a standard for this compound was synthesized and tested by uhplc ms ms see fig 3 for chromatogram the elution time was 2 39 min in esi mode this compound was detected in soil samples the results of uhplc ms ms and 1h nmr demonstrated that the compound was a degradation product of ethiprole and its structure is shown in fig 1 m401 was detected in soil degradation the soc2h5 on the heterocyclic ring has changed to sc2h5 and the cn group on the heterocyclic ring has changed to cno the chromatograms and mass spectra of a degradation compound with an m z of 399 and characteristic ion peaks of 399 and 382 in esi source and a retention time of 3 12 min are shown in fig 3 using previous reports to identify the compound with these signature ion peaks and fragmentation pattern we propose that this compound is 1 2 6 dichloro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 amido 4 ethylthio 5 aminopyrazole as shown in fig 3 this compound was detected in soil samples with a peak elution time of 2 01 min in esi mode data from uhplc ms ms and 1h nmr analyses support the likelihood that this compound is a putative degradation product of ethiprole and its structure is shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows the chromatograms and mass spectra of another novel compound with a retention time of 4 12 min and m z 312 ion peaks of 123 and 145 previous reports suggest this compound is 1 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 cyano 4 ethylthio 5 aminopyrazole based on its characteristic ion peaks and fragmentation pattern as shown in fig 3 this compound was detected in photolysis samples with a peak time at 2 90 min based on the results of uhplc ms ms and 1h nmr this compound is also a putative degradation product of ethiprole and its structure is shown in fig 3 m312 was detected in photolysis the soc2h5 on the heterocyclic ring has changed to sc2h5 and the two cl group on the benzene ring has gone 3 4 quantification of accumulated ethiprole degradation products the three degradation products were synthesized and their evolutions were determined by uhplc ms ms the changes in these three putative degradation products over time are shown in fig 4 when photolysis was carried out using the aqueous solution of 10 mg l compound m312 did not exceed 0 05 mg l after 15 fold concentration additionally other identified photolysis products tend to increase first and then decrease however degradation intermediates in water and soil first increase and then stabilize which is likely due to the higher concentration of ethiprole the maximum concentration of compound m401 in soil reached 0 90 mg kg on the 60th day and tended to be stable afterwards at the same time the maximum concentration of compound m399 which was identified in soil reached 0 30 mg kg on the 48th day and then stabilized m312 was detected in photolysis and m401 was detected in soil degradation based on fig 4 we can assume that m312 will be in the water at its highest concentration on the 3rd day after application in the real field environment and m401 will appear in the soil at its highest concentration on the 60th day after application in the real field environment the half lifes of ethiprole subjected to photolysis in different buffer solutions were 4 17 h 17 33 h m312 was transformed by photolysis and it was primary transformation product the degradation half life of ethiprole in soil from northeast china soil is 20 4 d under aerobic conditions and 11 9 d under anaerobic conditions m401 was detected in soil degradation in anaerobic conditions and it was primary transformation product based on the half lifes of ethiprole in photolysis and soil ethiprole s transformation product m401 was relatively persistent than m312 3 5 inference of ethiprole degradation pathway ethiprole is mainly used to control pests of rice after application to rice ethiprole can enter water and soil then undergo subsequent photolysis by sunlight and hydrolysis by water and soil the degradation pathway of ethiprole was inferred from mass spectrometry and nmr of putative degradation products that accumulated under photolytic and hydrolytic conditions to our knowledge this is the report detailing the detection of these degradation compounds and the first to find that reduction hydrolysis oxidation oxidative dechlorination and hydroxylation reactions mainly all contribute to the process of ethiprole degradation the proposed degradation pathway of ethiprole in the environment is shown in fig 5 3 6 toxicity of ethiprole transformation products the acute toxicity tests of the three degradation compounds m401 m399 m312 and ethiprole to daphnia magna straus pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and brachydanio rerio were conducted for daphnia magna straus the 96 h ec 50 values of m401 m399 m312 and ethiprole after 48 h of exposure are 0 77 10 00 1 65 and 2 70 mg l respectively table 3 shows the toxicity test results based on the chemical acute toxicity classification and labeling usepa 2015 for crustaceans category 3 ec 50 10 mg a i l category 2 1 0 mg a i l ec 50 10 0 mg a i l category 1 1 0 mg a i l m401 is in category 1 and it is very toxic to daphnia magna straus m312 and ethiprole are in category 2 and m399 is in category 3 the 96 h ec 50 values of daphnia magna straus exposed by m401 m399 m312 and ethiprole were analyzed by sas 9 4 with anova and their means compared by lsd the significant level was set to p 0 05 the toxicity of m401 to daphnia magna straus was significantly greater than m312 ethiprole and m399 the toxicity of m312 to daphnia magna straus was significantly greater than ethiprole the ec 50 values of m401 m399 m312 and ethiprole for pseudokirchneriella subcapitata are all 3 mg l based on the chemical acute toxicity classification and labeling usepa 2015 for aquatic plants category 3 ec 50 10 mg a i l category 2 1 0 mg a i l ec 50 10 0 mg a i l category 1 1 0 mg a i l they all in category 2 or 3 the lc 50 values of m401 m399 m312 and ethiprole for brachydanio rerio after 48 h of exposure are 10 45 8 1 and 10 mg l respectively according to the classification and labeling usepa 2015 for acute toxicity for b rerio category 3 lc 50 10 mg a i l category 2 1 0 mg a i l lc 50 10 0 mg a i l category 1 lc 50 1 0 mg a i l m401 m399 and ethiprole are in category 3 while m312 are in category 2 or 3 due to the solubility of those compounds and the low toxicity of them there was no specific number for the ec 50 values of pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the lc 50 values of brachydanio rerio therefore the anova analysis and lsd comparison were not conducted these results show that the degradation products of ethiprole exhibit a range of toxicities for daphnia magna straus pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and brachydanio rerio the toxicity of m401 to daphnia magna straus is significantly greater than that of its parent compound and it is most toxic to daphnia magna straus compared with the other three tested compounds the toxicity of m312 toward daphnia magna straus is also significantly greater than to that of the parent compound p 0 05 tests of these compounds in the remaining comparisons showed lower toxicity we conclude that monitoring of ethiprole degradation in the environment and reduce the harm and impact on various non target organisms at the same time ethiprole should be implemented in a rational way using the guidance of experimental data to this effect it is important to consider that of the three degradation products m401 the first product has greater toxicity than ethiprole while m312 and m399 degrade more slowly in the environment the toxicity studies of pesticides degradation products in the environment are not required in the registration process of china now in usepa report the manufacturer supplied information on identity metabolism and environmental fate methods of residue analysis and so on the transformation products in photolysis hydrolysis and soil degradation usepa 2011 were shown in supplementary data in the jmpr report ethiprole was shown to be hydrolytically stable at ph 4 5 and 7 over 31 days at 25 c in the dark benzimidazole of ethiprole was found in hydrolysis study the major photolysis products rpa 157925 m360 and ae 0764815 m342 were reported in natural pond water ethiprole sulfone m413 and ethiprole sulfide m413 were reported in ph 5 buffered aqueous solution during irradiation with artificial sunlight food and agriculture organization of the united states 2018 in the environmental fate part the manufacturer focused on the dynamic kinetics of ethiprole and only reported the major transformation products and the toxicity data of the transformation products to the aquatic animals cannot be found so we screened the transformation products in different environments thoroughly in uhplc q tof ms and have checked if any transformation products were missed in those reports m401 and m312 are new tps that has never been reported the toxicity of those metabolites has also been tested to the aquatic animals one possible reason why m312 was missed before was that m312 was not the major photolysis product m401 was found in soil degradation and the degradation products in different soils differ the soil used in this experiment was from haerbin china that s why m401 was missed before 4 conclusions it is necessary to consider the potential environmental impacts of pesticide degradation products as part of a complete picture of the environmental behavior of pesticides since the toxicity of pesticide by products also contributes to the evaluation of the ecological environment risks of pesticides high resolution mass spectrometry is a widely used method for investigating transformation products of pesticides in different environments with the further goal of ascertaining the environmental risks associated with ethiprole this study provides technical support for experimental and appropriate use of ethiprole as well as offering theoretical guidance for the development of similar biologically active compounds furthermore this research has important theoretical and practical significance in ensuring the safety of agricultural products in the environment the novel transformation product m401 was detected in soil degradation the soc2h5 on the heterocyclic ring of m401 has changed to sc2h5 and the cn group on the heterocyclic ring has changed to cno the cno change may cause the change of toxicity to the non target organism acknowledgement this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china china

18711,ethiprole and its degradation products were identified and quantified using uhplc q tof ms indoor culture experiments and uhplc q tof ms are used to study the hydrolysis photolysis and soil degradation behavior of ethiprole in water and soil the differences in ethiprole degradation products across a range of environmental conditions such as ph light and oxygen availability were compared in order to improve understanding of the ethiprole degradation pathway and the toxicity of the degradation products eleven degradation products were identified using uhplc q tof ms and metabolynx xs training software and two new degradation products m401 and m312 were characterized by 1h nmr and hr ms three degradation products m401 m399 and m312 were detected in samples using a uhplc ms ms protocol established in this study tests of acute toxicity of the three degradation products on brachydanio rerio pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and daphnia magna straus found that the toxicity of m401 to daphnia magna straus was greater than that of the parent compound indicating that ethiprole degradation should be carefully monitored in given the environmental risk posed by its degradation products graphical abstract image 1 keywords ethiprole hydrolysis photolysis soil degradation degradation products 1 introduction many types of synthetic insecticides have been widely used all over the world to control a variety of pests in agricultural production fenner et al 2013 however it is well known that overuse of insecticides can be hazardous for humans and the environment while pests also develop resistance to pesticides battershill et al 2004 bermúdez couso et al 2011 everett and matheson 2010 seiber and kleinschmidt 2011 it is important to understand how pesticides behave in the environment whether they persist in soils leach into the water or degrade the following exposure to light water or microbial catabolism to form other potentially harmful compounds the molecular weights of the pesticide degradation products are generally smaller than that of the parent compounds which may increase the likelihood of mobilization into surface and groundwater thus posing a significant potential threat to the non target organisms fava et al 2005 herrero hernández et al 2013 jin et al 2010 studies of pesticide degradation and determination of the residual content of the main transformation products under different conditions are needed to predict the chemical lifetime in the environment and to accurately assess potential biological impacts ethiprole is a new 1 phenylpyrazole insecticide widely used on pests of rice and stored grains due to its efficacy against a broad spectrum of sucking and chewing insects and having strong systemic activity in plants caboni et al 2003 ethiprole works at the gaba receptor as noncompetitive blockers of the gaba gated chloride channel and the functional group of ethiprole is 1 phenylpyrazoles zhao et al 2010 ethiprole is very similar to fipronil in chemical structure photochemistry metabolic activity and insecticidal activity caboni et al 2003 since ethiprole is effective against a broad spectrum of insects it has a large number of uses in agricultural production in china guosheng 2004 ethiprole is currently registered for use on tea in japan and china and is registered on rice in brazil indonesia japan thailand and vietnam usepa 2011 hu et al reported that ethiprole was stable in water and showed varying degrees of toxicity for organisms in the environment hu et al 2012 some researchers reported that ethiprole had high toxicity to mysid shrimps and meanwhile had probable carcinogenicity usepa 2011 ethiprole is relatively toxic to bees by ingestion or topical application and foliar application are not recommended by the manufacturer when bees are present agdata 2019 according to data from the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac ethiprole has moderate persistence in the soil with a dt50 of 50 days iupac 2018 thus far the study of the environmental behavior of ethiprole has been focused on its degradation in soil and water the establishment of analytical methods for tracking residual pesticide as well as some research into its toxicity for non target organisms only one paper so far has investigated the transformation products of ethiprole by using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and high performance liquid chromatography hplc caboni et al 2003 and only studied the transformation products formed by photodecomposition the radioisotope tracer technique is an important research tool in the study of a pesticide degradation pathway product composition mechanisms of action combined residue and its environmental risk smith et al 1995 however it is difficult to obtain the isotope labeled compounds because of the high cost and complicated process to synthesize them with the 14c marker labeled on the original drug and high toxicity for the human body li et al 2010 meanwhile the study of degradation kinetics of residues has largely been the focus for research into pesticide degradation processes chen et al 2012 li et al 2013 madsen et al 2015 in addition many of these studies are unpersuasive given their reliance on low resolution mass spectrometry for identification of degradation products fuhrmann et al 2014 karas et al 2015 phugare et al 2013 in recent years with the development and improvement of high resolution mass spectrometry technology qualitative analyses of compounds are now conducted using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uhplc q tof ms this technique has high sensitivity high resolution and high accuracy providing precise mass spectra of both parent and fragment ions of each compound in a given sample li et al 2015 the samples were screened by uhplc q tof ms and the data acquired by mse and metabolynx xs training was used to infer the structure of putative transformation products jacobs et al 2013 lu et al 2012 wu et al 2012 yan et al 2010 nmr is a technique used to determine a compound

this study is focused on the environmental degradation behavior of ethiprole and identification of its degradation products in different environments an effective method was developed to quantify ethiprole residue and identify its degradation products in soil and water different environmental factors such as ph temperature and degradation mode such as hydrolysis or photolysis were tested to compare the differences in patterns and degradation products in addition the non target toxicity of the ethiprole degradation products was also evaluated for three non target model organisms 2

and ethiprole degradation in soil the test soil without any detectable ethiprole or pesticides was collected from harbin heilongjiang province it was stored in a cool place and air dried physical and chemical properties of the soil are shown in table 1 test soil was weighed in 1000 g increments and ultrapure water was added to raise the soil moisture content up to 40 of full water saturation 56 5 of soil in northeast china all samples were then incubated at a constant temperature 25 1 c and humidity without light for 14 d to provide soil microbiota enough time to degrade ethiprole incubation experiments were carried out with the ethiprole using 250 ml brown aerobe jar covered with sterile cotton plugs and brown anaerobe jar respectively 20 g soil was first spiked with 200 μl stock solution in acetone containing approximately 2 mg ethiprole and the resulting mixture was stirred for 5 min the spiked soils were then allowed to air dry for 10 min before the remaining soil 180 g was added the resulting combination was mixed thoroughly for another 15 min which yielded a fortification level of 10 mg kg in aerobic conditions the water content of the soil samples was adjusted to about 60 of the field holding capacity w w and maintained by frequently adding deionized water each jar was opened weekly to let the air in to maintain its aerobic conditions during the incubation the control was the same treatment but no ethiprole added in anaerobic conditions the concentration of ethiprole was also 10 mg kg after preparing samples using the same protocol as with the aerobic assays an appropriate amount of sterilized ultrapure water was added to each brown jar until a water layer of 2 cm formed on top of the soil layer to form a relatively anaerobic condition jars were again plugged with cotton and placed in a vacuum desiccator the air in the vacuum drier was drawn out and replaced with nitrogen gas to facilitate the development and maintenance of anaerobic conditions this nitrogen replacement process has repeated three times the control was the same treatment but no ethiprole added all samples were cultured at 25 c in stable temperature and humidity under dark conditions and removed at regular timepoints of 0 h 2 d 4 d 6 d 8 d 16 d 30 d 50 d 64 d 80 d and 92 d for each sample 20 g was collected and the experiment was set up in 3 groups with a

then diluted with water to 1000 ml the ph value was corrected after sterilization the acetonitrile solutions 10 mg l were prepared by using each buffer solution of ph 5 7 and 9 respectively and ultra pure water ph 7 then the aqueous solution of ethiprole was put into the quartz photolysis tube with a tightly closed cap the tubes were placed in a specialized tank after the photolysis apparatus was calibrated for testing a xenon lamp light source wavelength 290 nm 800 nm was used for exposure to ultraviolet light 100 10 μw cm2 uv intensity was 365 nm and the reaction temperature was 25 1 c during the test water samples were collected periodically with a minimum of 7 time points and the change in ethiprole concentration for each buffered water sample was measured until the photolytic rate reached above 90 simultaneously we set up a control test under a dark condition with foil with 3 replicates for each treatment during the photolysis test other light sources were minimized or eliminated to reduce the impact on the accuracy of results 2 2 3 hydrolysis samples the sterile buffer solutions and ultrapure water were used as solvents to prepare a 10 mg l ethiprole solution on a sterile workbench after stirring well the samples were placed in brown reagent bottles and sealed these bottles were incubated at a constant temperature of either 15 25 or 35 c in the dark water samples were collected regularly for more than 10 time points and the residue of ethiprole was determined each treatment was performed with 3 replicates 2 3 sample treatment the soil samples the different buffers and water samples were each weighed to 10 0 g separately accurate to 0 1 g placed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes after a 2 min vortex followed by a 30 min quiescence at room temperature 5 ml of ultra pure water was added only to the soil then 10 ml of 1 formic acid acetonitrile was added and vortexed for 5 min following that 3 g of anhydrous mgso4 and 2 g of nacl were added to the soil

monitored by checking mass accuracy before use the chromatography and sensitivity were checked during data acquisition for every sample and it was re tuned or re calibrated if mass error exceeded 2 ppm background signals were identified by analysis of lab control samples deionized water and acetonitrile and method blanks then those signals from the control were substracted from ms ms analysis regardless of peak intensity by comparison of the samples with an ethiprole control sample metabolynx software was used to select all characteristic peaks of metabolites transformation products and analyze its elemental composition a spiked recovery assay was conducted at the three fortified concentration levels to evaluate the performance of the method the series of ethiprole standard solutions were tested three times 2 6 acute toxicity experiment the test for acute toxicity by three ethiprole degradation products in brachydanio rerio and pseudokirchneriella subcapitata was performed according to the standard test method oecd 201 the test of acute toxicity to daphnia magna was performed according to the standard test method oecd 202 the three degradation products m401 m399 and m312 were synthesized by shanghai simr biotech co ltd shanghai china the 96 h ec 50 values of daphnia magna straus exposed by m401 m399 m312 and ethiprole for 48 were analyzed by sas 9 4 with anova and their means compared by lsd the significant level was set to p 0 05 2 7 data processing for most of the pesticides in soil degradation followed a model of first order kinetics the total reaction can be divided into two stages namely the rapid degradation of the initial stage and the lag phase of the later stage the equation of degradation kinetics for ethiprole in soil and the half life of degradation dt50 are as follows ct c0 e kt t1 2 ln2 k 0 693 k 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis method validation the series of ethiprole standard solution were injection tested for three times the results showed that the ethiprole exhibits a good linear relationship in the range of 0 01 10 mg l and the regression equation is y 31560x 1055 2 r2 0 9994 the recoveries experiments of 0 01 0 1 1 0 and 10 0 mg kg in blank soil different buffer solutions and water samples were carried out by the recycling method above and five replicates were set for each spiked level the average recoveries and relative standard deviations rsds of ethiprole in different buffer solutions and water were obtained according to the above detection methods the average recovery of ethiprole in soil matrix is 84 2 105 5 and the variation coefficient is 3 9 7 8 ethiprole in different aqueous solution recovery is 80 2 98 5 with the variation coefficient of 2 1 6 2 according to the instructions of dg sanco 12495 2011 recoveries between 70 and 120 and rsd 20 the test method of this experiment completely meets the requirements of the method s accuracy precision and sensitivity in pesticide residue analysis 3 2 degradation behavior of ethiprole in different conditions 3 2 1 soil degradation the degradation of ethiprole in soil follows a first order kinetic equation the degradation kinetic parameters and half life results are shown in fig 1 the degradation half life of ethiprole in soil from northeast china soil is 20 4 d under aerobic conditions and 11 9 d under anaerobic conditions the degradation rate of ethiprole in water accumulated anaerobic conditions is significantly faster than that under aerobic conditions there are many factors affecting the rate of ethiprole degradation in soil we found the driving factors behind ethiprole degradation are microbial action and hydrolysis when cultured in a dark incubator and therefore microbial populations are likely responsible for the rapid degradation of ethiprole under anaerobic conditions in field soil other studies have also found that most organochlorine pesticides have faster dechlorination rates under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions tabak et al 1997 it is also possible that in conditions of water accumulation the adsorption capacity of soil for ethiprole is decreased and ethiprole is thus more prone to hydrolysis in water on the soil surface our experimental results are not the same as data showing that ethiprole has a degradation half life in paddy soil under anaerobic conditions of 2 8 d 3 2 d as reported by shang zishuai et al shang et al 2010 torniainen et al 1996 degradation half life of ethiprole reported by liang xuyang under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in black soil from northeast china is 46 2 h and 25 7 h respectively which is also not the same as our results in terms of duration but shows the same pattern of slower degradation in aerobic conditions 27 this longer half life duration may be caused by differences in the physical and chemical properties between the two soils specifically the black soil may contain more organic matter providing more accessible carbon substrate for microbes additionally differences in degradation rates can be attributed to the different pre culture incubation times resulting in enrichment for different microbial populations with variation in the abundance of species that have the metabolic capability for degradation of ethiprole in soil it is also possible that there were great differences in acclimation to anaerobic conditions for the microbes 3 2 2 hydrolysis this study shows that hydrolysis of ethiprole varies across a range of ph values and temperatures the experimental data show significant differences in the degree of ethiprole hydrolysis between acid and alkali conditions degradation is slow under acidic and neutral conditions with only 8 2 hydrolyzed in ph 5 buffer solution 16 7 hydrolyzed in ph 7 buffer and only 15 6 in ultrapure water ph 7 after 87 days of incubation at 25 c however the hydrolyzed portion reached 41 6 in a ph 9 buffer solution after incubation at 25 c for 87 days therefore ethiprole is ostensibly stable under acidic conditions whereas it tends to hydrolyze faster with an increase in alkalinity temperature also affects the hydrolysis rate of ethiprole to some extent as temperature increases the hydrolysis rate is also accelerated guo min et al tested the effect of different ph on the degradation rate of fipronil and found that the degradation of fipronil accelerated with increasing alkalinity of the buffer solution which is a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction for fipronil nucleophilic groups water or oh attack electrophilic groups c p and s among other atoms so that fipronil degrades rapidly in alkaline conditions torniainen et al 1996 the results of this work show that ethiprole also degrades rapidly under alkaline conditions due to the similar chemical structures of ethiprole and fipronil it is likely that during the process of hydrolysis ethiprole may also undergo bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction 3 2 3 photolysis we measured the photochemical degradation of ethiprole in aqueous solution using a xenon lamp artificial light source the results are shown in fig 2 the photodegradation rate of ethiprole in different ph buffer solutions again follows first order kinetics under the same light conditions the photolytic rate of ethiprole in neutral and alkaline solutions is significantly faster than that in pure water and acidic solutions the half life of ethiprole subjected to photolysis in ph 7 and ph 9 buffer solutions was 4 17 h and 3 69 h respectively while the half life in ph 5 buffer or ultrapure water was 17 33 h and 9 90 h respectively the photolysis rates in neutral and alkaline conditions are close and both of which are 4 5 times faster than in acidic conditions the most plausible explanation of these data is that the ph value affects the reaction of oh free radicals and reactive oxygen species with ethyl nitrile in the solution it may also be the case that ethiprole is more susceptible to hydrolysis in higher ph buffer solutions thus resulting in the acceleration of photolysis in alkaline conditions 25 3 3 structure identification of ethiprole transformation products the transformation products of ethiprole were detected by uhplc q tof ms and the data acquired by mse were analyzed using masslynx software by comparison of the samples with an ethiprole control sample metabolynx software was used to select all characteristic peaks of transformation products and analyze its elemental composition metabolynx xs training was used to infer the structure of putative transformation products finally the mass fragment software was used to perform ion fragment alignment in high energy ion channels among the identified transformation products eleven degradation products of ethiprole were detected in water and soil samples nine of which were previously reported caboni et al 2003 usepa 2015 and two new transformation products m401 and m312 which were detected for the first time in this work the three new degradation products were synthesized based on their putative structure for further study for their toxicity and comparison of their mse spectra information on each of the eleven degradation products is provided in table 2 the functional group of ethiprole is 1 phenylpyrazoles most of the transformation products have 1 phenylpyrazoles so their activities may be consistent with ethiprole s mode of action m230 and m282 don t have the 1 phenylpyrazoles so the activities of m230 and m282 may be different from ethiprole s mode of action one novel compound was identified with an m z of 401 characteristic ion peaks at 401 and 255 and a retention time of 3 02 min the chromatogram and mass spectra derived by esi of this compound are shown in fig 3 according to its characteristic ion peaks and fragmentation characteristics described in a previous report of fipronil it is presumed to be 1 2 6 dichloro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 cyano 4 ethylsulfonyl 5 aminopyrazole m401 a standard for this compound was synthesized and tested by uhplc ms ms see fig 3 for chromatogram the elution time was 2 39 min in esi mode this compound was detected in soil samples the results of uhplc ms ms and 1h nmr demonstrated that the compound was a degradation product of ethiprole and its structure is shown in fig 1 m401 was detected in soil degradation the soc2h5 on the heterocyclic ring has changed to sc2h5 and the cn group on the heterocyclic ring has changed to cno the chromatograms and mass spectra of a degradation compound with an m z of 399 and characteristic ion peaks of 399 and 382 in esi source and a retention time of 3 12 min are shown in fig 3 using previous reports to identify the compound with these signature ion peaks and fragmentation pattern we propose that this compound is 1 2 6 dichloro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 amido 4 ethylthio 5 aminopyrazole as shown in fig 3 this compound was detected in soil samples with a peak elution time of 2 01 min in esi mode data from uhplc ms ms and 1h nmr analyses support the likelihood that this compound is a putative degradation product of ethiprole and its structure is shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows the chromatograms and mass spectra of another novel compound with a retention time of 4 12 min and m z 312 ion peaks of 123 and 145 previous reports suggest this compound is 1 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 cyano 4 ethylthio 5 aminopyrazole based on its characteristic ion peaks and fragmentation pattern as shown in fig 3 this compound was detected in photolysis samples with a peak time at 2 90 min based on the results of uhplc ms ms and 1h nmr this compound is also a putative degradation product of ethiprole and its structure is shown in fig 3 m312 was detected in photolysis the soc2h5 on the heterocyclic ring has changed to sc2h5 and the two cl group on the benzene ring has gone 3 4 quantification of accumulated ethiprole degradation products the three degradation products were synthesized and their evolutions were determined by uhplc ms ms the changes in these three putative degradation products over time are shown in fig 4 when photolysis was carried out using the aqueous solution of 10 mg l compound m312 did not exceed 0 05 mg l after 15 fold concentration additionally other identified photolysis products tend to increase first and then decrease however degradation intermediates in water and soil first increase and then stabilize which is likely due to the higher concentration of ethiprole the maximum concentration of compound m401 in soil reached 0 90 mg kg on the 60th day and tended to be stable afterwards at the same time the maximum concentration of compound m399 which was identified in soil reached 0 30 mg kg on the 48th day and then stabilized m312 was detected in photolysis and m401 was detected in soil degradation based on fig 4 we can assume that m312 will be in the water at its highest concentration on the 3rd day after application in the real field environment and m401 will appear in the soil at its highest concentration on the 60th day after application in the real field environment the half lifes of ethiprole subjected to photolysis in different buffer solutions were 4 17 h 17 33 h m312 was transformed by photolysis and it was primary transformation product the degradation half life of ethiprole in soil from northeast china soil is 20 4 d under aerobic conditions and 11 9 d under anaerobic conditions m401 was detected in soil degradation in anaerobic conditions and it was primary transformation product based on the half lifes of ethiprole in photolysis and soil ethiprole s transformation product m401 was relatively persistent than m312 3 5 inference of ethiprole degradation pathway ethiprole is mainly used to control pests of rice after application to rice ethiprole can enter water and soil then undergo subsequent photolysis by sunlight and hydrolysis by water and soil the degradation pathway of ethiprole was inferred from mass spectrometry and nmr of putative degradation products that accumulated under photolytic and hydrolytic conditions to our knowledge this is the report detailing the detection of these degradation compounds and the first to find that reduction hydrolysis oxidation oxidative dechlorination and hydroxylation reactions mainly all contribute to the process of ethiprole degradation the proposed degradation pathway of ethiprole in the environment is shown in fig 5 3 6 toxicity of ethiprole transformation products the acute toxicity tests of the three degradation compounds m401 m399 m312 and ethiprole to daphnia magna straus pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and brachydanio rerio were conducted for daphnia magna straus the 96 h ec 50 values of m401 m399 m312 and ethiprole after 48 h of exposure are 0 77 10 00 1 65 and 2 70 mg l respectively table 3 shows the toxicity test results based on the chemical acute toxicity classification and labeling usepa 2015 for crustaceans category 3 ec 50 10 mg a i l category 2 1 0 mg a i l ec 50 10 0 mg a i l category 1 1 0 mg a i l m401 is in category 1 and it is very toxic to daphnia magna straus m312 and ethiprole are in category 2 and m399 is in category 3 the 96 h ec 50 values of daphnia magna straus exposed by m401 m399 m312 and ethiprole were analyzed by sas 9 4 with anova and their means compared by lsd the significant level was set to p 0 05 the toxicity of m401 to daphnia magna straus was significantly greater than m312 ethiprole and m399 the toxicity of m312 to daphnia magna straus was significantly greater than ethiprole the ec 50 values of m401 m399 m312 and ethiprole for pseudokirchneriella subcapitata are all 3 mg l based on the chemical acute toxicity classification and labeling usepa 2015 for aquatic plants category 3 ec 50 10 mg a i l category 2 1 0 mg a i l ec 50 10 0 mg a i l category 1 1 0 mg a i l they all in category 2 or 3 the lc 50 values of m401 m399 m312 and ethiprole for brachydanio rerio after 48 h of exposure are 10 45 8 1 and 10 mg l respectively according to the classification and labeling usepa 2015 for acute toxicity for b rerio category 3 lc 50 10 mg a i l category 2 1 0 mg a i l lc 50 10 0 mg a i l category 1 lc 50 1 0 mg a i l m401 m399 and ethiprole are in category 3 while m312 are in category 2 or 3 due to the solubility of those compounds and the low toxicity of them there was no specific number for the ec 50 values of pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the lc 50 values of brachydanio rerio therefore the anova analysis and lsd comparison were not conducted these results show that the degradation products of ethiprole exhibit a range of toxicities for daphnia magna straus pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and brachydanio rerio the toxicity of m401 to daphnia magna straus is significantly greater than that of its parent compound and it is most toxic to daphnia magna straus compared with the other three tested compounds the toxicity of m312 toward daphnia magna straus is also significantly greater than to that of the parent compound p 0 05 tests of these compounds in the remaining comparisons showed lower toxicity we conclude that monitoring of ethiprole degradation in the environment and reduce the harm and impact on various non target organisms at the same time ethiprole should be implemented in a rational way using the guidance of experimental data to this effect it is important to consider that of the three degradation products m401 the first product has greater toxicity than ethiprole while m312 and m399 degrade more slowly in the environment the toxicity studies of pesticides degradation products in the environment are not required in the registration process of china now in usepa report the manufacturer supplied information on identity metabolism and environmental fate methods of residue analysis and so on the transformation products in photolysis hydrolysis and soil degradation usepa 2011 were shown in supplementary data in the jmpr report ethiprole was shown to be hydrolytically stable at ph 4 5 and 7 over 31 days at 25 c in the dark benzimidazole of ethiprole was found in hydrolysis study the major photolysis products rpa 157925 m360 and ae 0764815 m342 were reported in natural pond water ethiprole sulfone m413 and ethiprole sulfide m413 were reported in ph 5 buffered aqueous solution during irradiation with artificial sunlight food and agriculture organization of the united states 2018 in the environmental fate part the manufacturer focused on the dynamic kinetics of ethiprole and only reported the major transformation products and the toxicity data of the transformation products to the aquatic animals cannot be found so we screened the transformation products in different environments thoroughly in uhplc q tof ms and have checked if any transformation products were missed in those reports m401 and m312 are new tps that has never been reported the toxicity of those metabolites has also been tested to the aquatic animals one possible reason why m312 was missed before was that m312 was not the major photolysis product m401 was found in soil degradation and the degradation products in different soils differ the soil used in this experiment was from haerbin china that s why m401 was missed before 4 conclusions it is necessary to consider the potential environmental impacts of pesticide degradation products as part of a complete picture of the environmental behavior of pesticides since the toxicity of pesticide by products also contributes to the evaluation of the ecological environment risks of pesticides high resolution mass spectrometry is a widely used method for investigating transformation products of pesticides in different environments with the further goal of ascertaining the environmental risks associated with ethiprole this study provides technical support for experimental and appropriate use of ethiprole as well as offering theoretical guidance for the development of similar biologically active compounds furthermore this research has important theoretical and practical significance in ensuring the safety of agricultural products in the environment the novel transformation product m401 was detected in soil degradation the soc2h5 on the heterocyclic ring of m401 has changed to sc2h5 and the cn group on the heterocyclic ring has changed to cno the cno change may cause the change of toxicity to the non target organism acknowledgement this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china china

such as bioassays and biomarkers as integrative techniques that bridge the gap between chemical contamination and ecological effects brack et al 2019 based on the research project solutions and the european monitoring network norman a basic bioassay battery has been suggested including in vitro tests for estrogenic activity brack et al 2019 escher et al 2018 moreover studies across europe investigating the fate and distribution of edcs in the environment have demonstrated using in vitro bioassays and chemical analytical methods that edcs sorb to suspended particles and thus accumulate

properties of many edcs even higher estrogenic activity in terms of ee2 equivalents eeeqs ranging from 0 25 up to 55 μg eeeq kg were reported from the yes assay by buchinger et al 2013b in a sediment survey along the saale river and its tributaries in germany moreover high levels of np and e1 were detected by lc and gc ms ms and found to contribute most to the observed estrogenic activity from the german river sediments while it has been recognized that ecs have a high tendency to accumulate in sediment little is known about their bioavailability and potential for remobilization transport and redistribution due to extreme weather events such as floods bioturbation or dredging however some studies indicate that estrogenic compounds have the potential to be remobilised from sediments during floods as shown by estrogen related endpoints oetken et al 2005 the frequency and intensity of flood events is predicted to increase in the context of global climate change petrow and merz 2009 on account of this the european parliament initiated the directive 2007 60 ec regarding the assessment and management of flood risks whereby they established a framework aiming to assess and reduce the adverse consequences of floods for human health and the environment eu 2007 60 ec one major aspect of such risk assessment includes the evaluation of sediment contamination and the potential of contaminant remobilization from sediments whereby the sink might turn into a source of pollution hollert et al 2007 it has been recognized that good chemical status and good ecological status according to the wfd is not always attainable due to sediment contamination and recommendations for improvements have included the establishment of environmental quality standards eqs for sediments that consider the bioavailability of sediment contaminants brack et al 2017 bioavailability has been described as the portion of the total quantity or concentration of a chemical in the environment that is potentially available for biological action such as uptake by an organism concentration of freely dissolved organic compounds such as ecs are generally assumed to be more readily available for uptake in an organism and thus bioavailable in water rand 1995 the bioavailability of sediment bound ecs was examined in the present study under turbulent conditions in order to estimate the risk of remobilized ecs to fish during flood events specifically the objectives of the present study as a part of the interdisciplinary project house water consortium crawford et al 2017 were to investigate 1 the accumulation of ecs and their activity in river sediment and 2 the potential of these compounds to be remobilized from the sediment under turbulent conditions such as in a flood event and thus become bioavailable for fish the luppe river was chosen as a worst case scenario for sediment borne ec contamination based on the high levels of np and e1 previously reported by buchinger et al 2013b the recently developed planar yes assay buchinger et al 2013a which combines high performance thin layer chromatography hptlc with the traditional in vitro yes assay was used in addition to chemical

onto the plate four to eight dilutions of a reference substance mixture np e1 e2 ee2 and estriol e3 were included on each plate for calibration purposes to express the signals detected in the sample in terms of eeqs this allows a quantitative assessment of the agonistic potential of the sample in addition to the qualitative assessment the calculation of the equivalent concentration of the individual signals detected in the samples was based on the inverse five parameter log logistic function of the reference compound subsequently values are expressed in ng kg or ng l of the original sample considering the enrichment factor application volume and pre dilution three independent replicates were performed on different days using separate aliquots of yeast suspension 2 5 pocis and chemcatcher laboratory calibration a laboratory calibration for e1 e2 ee2 and np was performed with pocis and chemcatcher pocis consisted of a membrane sorbent membrane sandwich see figure a1 to obtain a surface area per mass of sorbent ratio of 180 cm2 g as described in alvarez et al 2007 54 5 0 5 mg oasis hlb was sandwiched between two pes membranes 9 8 cm2 surface area held in place by compression between two stainless steel washers empore disks were mounted similarly between two stainless steel washers conditioning of hlb and chemcatcher were done according to alvarez et al 2007 and skodova et al 2016 for further information see appendix the calibration of both the pocis and chemcatcher was performed using a static renewal exposure setup in which the samplers were exposed to the target compounds under stirred conditions ca 300 rev min at 20 2 c in darkness one single chemcatcher was applied per beaker with 1 l milli q water spiked with a nominal concentration of 5 μg l of e1 e2 ee2 and 4n np and stirred by a magnetic stirrer at 300 rev min at 20 c the water was renewed every day and the ph measured chemcatchers were removed after exposure times of 2 4 7 or 10 days duplicates were done per time point additionally a water control without chemicals was included calibration of pocis was done similarly with slight modifications four pocis were applied per beaker with 1 l milli q water spiked with 5 μg l of each substance and exposed for 4 7 14 and 21 days pocis calibration was performed in triplicate per sampling time point and one control exposed to water only was included per sampling time point exposed pocis and chemcatcher were extracted individually according to alvarez et al 2007 skodova et al 2016 see appendix before extraction 5 μg deuterated e2 ee2 and 4n np standards were added to each sampler target substances were determined using lc ms ms to verify the nominal water concentration of 5 μg l water samples were taken at several time points throughout the chemcatcher calibration experiment sampling rates were approximated as linear uptake using the slope of the linear regression of the amount of substance found in each sampler plotted against the sampling time points see eq a1 rs for pocis were calculated using an iterative approach to correct for the changing number of samplers during the exposure eq a2 a5 and figure a2 2 6 suspended sediment experiment to investigate the bioavailability of ecs np e1 e2 ee2 present in luppe sediment 5 g d w from sampling site luppe1 2017 was taken sieved to 2 mm and suspended in 1 l of tap water the sediment was stirred at 300 rpm at 20 c for 24 h in the dark to allow for equilibration before a passive sampler was added to the sediment suspension individual pocis and chemcatcher samplers were exposed for 10 or 5 days respectively to the suspended sediment under constant stirring suspension test a it is possible that the samplers would cause a depletion of the target compounds in the water phase during the time of exposure or that the system would not be able to sustain the equilibrium state over several days therefore a depletion test was conducted where a pair of each pocis or chemcatcher were successively exposed to the same suspended sediment for 10 or 5 days respectively as a first step single chemcatcher or pocis were exposed as described above suspension test b after their removal a new set of samplers were individually deployed into the same suspended sediment this experiment was repeated for the chemcatcher suspension test c all sediment exposure experiments with pocis and chemcatcher suspension test a c were performed in duplicates upon removal all samplers were cleaned carefully with deionized water before extraction as described above target analysis was done by lc ms ms the amount of internal standard for lc ms ms was 50 ng deuterated standard mix of e2 ee2 and np for all tests with sediment in addition one chemcatcher extract was tested in the p yes as described above time weighted average concentrations in the water ng l ctwa were calculated using the experimentally determined respective sampling rates and eq a1 the mass distribution of the different ecs was used as an indicator for bioavailability in this study setup and was estimated as 1 m a s s d i s t r i b u t i o n c t w a v w c s m s 100 where the initial concentration in sediment ng g is expressed as cs mass of sediment g as ms and water volume l as vw 2 7 quantification by lc ms ms identification and quantification of target substances e1 e2 ee2 and np was done by mass spectrometry with a ltq orbitrap xl equipped with a heated electron spray ionization hesi ion source performed in positive ionization mode detailed information see appendix normalization of the response to compensate fluctuations in ionization and derivatization efficiency were conducted with deuterated standards limit of quantification loq and detection lod were calculated according to alvarez 2010 as 3 and 7 fold respectively the standard deviation sd of the mean blank concentration of the compound table a2 blank samples were produced by using solvents and derivatization without passive sampler 3 results 3 1 accumulation of ecs and related estrogenic activity along the luppe river sediment along the luppe river was characterized by particle size distribution as clayey silt with a high total organic carbon toc content of 9 except for sampling sites 2 and 5 which had 3 toc and were classified as loamy or silty sand table a1 estrogenic activity expressed as eeq in sediments measured by the yes varied along the luppe eeqs found at sampling sites 1 3 and 4 17 5 1 5 15 3 0 9 and 20 1 2 5 μg eeq kg were relatively high compared to sites 5 8 1 0 5 μg eeq kg and 2 3 4 0 2 μg eeq kg which were about 2 5 and 6 times lower respectively fig 2 measured eeqs were found to be three times higher during the resampling of site 1 a year later table 1 moreover in all luppe sediment extracts three or even four distinct fluorescence signals could be detected after separation by hptlc followed by subsequent p yes the retention times r f of these signals aligned with the standard compounds r f np 0 819 0 010 e1 0 681 0 014 ee2 0 567 0 010 e2 0 4233 0 0079 figure a3 shows the hptlc plate after chromatographic and yes development considering the corresponding r f as well as the reporter assay induction np e1 and e2 were found in all luppe sediments whereas ee2 was only present in samples from sites 1 and 2 included negative and process controls were below the limit of detection for both tests the p yes and yes see figure a3 blank quantitative evaluation of the p yes revealed high concentrations of np 8 7 up to 37 6 mg kg and e1 5 7 up to 92 4 μg kg whereas e2 and ee2 when found ranged from 0 1 up to 0 9 μg kg or 0 03 0 04 μg kg respectively fluorescence signals for the compounds np e1 and ee2 that were found in the sediment extracts were compared to the corresponding e2 signal to evaluate their relative potency in eeqs these qualitative results are summarized in fig 2 where the area of the circles is proportional to the measured yes eeqs in μg eeq kg and the slices are proportional to the corresponding eeqs for the single substances relative contributions of the four target ecs to the sediment estrogenic activity were uniform along the luppe river fig 2 e1 accounted for approx 50 of the total estrogenic effects in μg eeqs kg measured via p yes followed by np accounting for approx 35 although only low concentrations of e2 were detected in the luppe sediments due to the high potency e2 accounted for approx 14 of the estrogenic effect finally the estrogenic effect attributed to ee2 when present was negligible approx 1 from sediment across all luppe sampling sites target compound analysis with lc ms ms confirmed the presence of np e1 and e2 in sediment extracts from sampling site 1 whereas ee2 was not detected above the limit of detection concentrations for np and e1 were comparable with both methods p yes as well as lc ms ms see table 1 whereas e2 could be detected but not quantified by means of lc ms ms additionally np 75 4 ng l and e1 19 7 ng l were both detected by means of lc ms ms in water samples from the luppe river at sampling site 1 calculated sediment partition coefficients kd between water and sediment kd ctwa cs were 0 001 for np and 0 067 for e1 indicating strong association of these substances with the sediment phase 3 2 calibration of pocis and chemcatcher laboratory calibration of pocis and chemcatcher was performed to determine sampling rates rs for the four target compounds np e1 e2 and ee2 uptake of these compounds into chemcatcher and pocis over time using a static renewal system with spiked water is shown in figure a 4 both passive sampling devices exhibited an integrative linear uptake for the steroids and np over time r2 ranged from 0 98 to 0 99 except for uptake of np in pocis in which no linear uptake was observed water concentration cw of all spiked compounds before sampler deployment t0 differed up to 25 from nominal water concentration of 5 μg l table 2 cw for all compounds after 24 h of sampling by chemcatcher were reduced by at least a factor of three temperature was constant during the whole experiment at 20 c and ph was 5 6 all negative controls in both chemcatcher and pocis calibration had concentrations that were below the lod data obtained from the laboratory calibrations were used to calculate rs as described above and in the supplementary information rs values of chemcatcher varied between 0 53 and 0 66 l d whereas rs values obtained for pocis were approx seven times lower ranging from 0 081 to 0 093 l d table 2 3 3 bioavailability of ecs from sediment under turbulent conditions e1 and np were found in the water phase in all sediment re mobilization tests evaluated by passive sampling with both pocis and chemcatcher and subsequent lc ms ms analysis however neither e2 nor ee2 could be directly detected by lc ms ms ctwa were calculated for np and e1 based on the experimentally determined rs values see eq a1 except for np in the pocis due to the missing calibration discussed above calculated ctwa for e1 were comparable between pocis and chemcatcher and varied from 9 3 up to 28 8 ng l and 7 5 up to 22 3 ng l between the suspension tests a c respectively table 3 the calculated ctwa for np ranged from 2 2 to 28 0 μg l between the suspension tests a c and were about 1000 times higher compared to e1 the equilibrium capacity of the sediment was investigated by consecutive deployment of passive samplers within a constant sediment water system the pocis did not deplete e1 from the sediment water re suspension system since the calculated ctwa did not differ significantly mann whitney test p 0 60 between the first 28 8 6 3 ng l and second 24 8 5 0 ng l sampling period 10 d later in contrast the ctwa of both e1 and np for the chemcatcher were about 2 6 1 0 4 ng l and 8 3 5 2 8 ng l times lower respectively after the second sampling period mann whitney test p 0 028 fig 3 the chemcatcher therefore depleted e1 and np from the re suspension system used in this experimental setup however the mass distribution as an indicator for the bioavailability in this study was comparable between the two passive sampling systems for e1 varying between 2 5 and 9 8 greater bioavailability was observed for np with 17 8 ending up in the dissolved phase in addition to lc ms ms analysis one single chemcatcher extract was investigated in the p yes in this extract e1 4 8 ng l e2 0 2 ng l ee2 0 5 ng l and np 24 5 μg l were detected based on comparison to the included standard compounds 4 discussion in the present study concentrations of ecs accumulated in sediments along the luppe river which had earlier been described as a hotspot for ec contamination could be related to the corresponding estrogenic activity we used a novel screening tool p yes which combines high performance thin layer chromatography with an in vitro bioassay yes to conclude that mostly e1 and np accounted for the high estrogenic activity found in the luppe sediments eeqs as well as concentrations of ecs determined for sediments along the luppe river in the present study were similar to that previously found at the same sampling site 55 μg eeeq kg np 115 mg kg e1 20 4 μg kg e2 1 5 μg kg buchinger et al 2013b the fact that our findings agree with the previous study provides further support for the assumption of buchinger et al 2013b that the sediment associated estrogenic activity of the luppe is historical rather than the result of modern sources of input despite the overall high estrogenic activity along the river course determined from the current study measured activities at sampling site 2 and 5 appeared to be lower compared to the other sites the lower estrogenic activity might be explained by the differences in physicochemical properties of the sediment among the sites with the sediment type at these sites having less fine particles approx 20 less silt 3 fold lower toc content and more sandy material compared to the other sites table a1 the findings of our study agree with previous literature reports which showed that ec concentrations and estrogenic activity are higher in fractions of fine particles and that organic matter has a significant influence on the sorption of ecs to sediment yamamoto et al 2003 the fact that ee2 was only detected in sediment samples from site 1 and 2 indicates that ee2 pollution might result from a different source of this pollutant possibly from surrounding households or sewage treatment plants adeel et al 2017 moreover the 3 fold higher estrogenic activity in luppe sediment from 2017 compared to 2016 together with the unchanged np and e1 concentrations might indicate that additional ecs contribute to the estrogenic activity in luppe sediment from 2017 in agreement with buchinger et al 2013b the present study demonstrates that the luppe serves as a hotspot for ecs with contamination in sediments exceeding the mean estrogenic activity found in the nearby catchment area of the saale river by at least 37 times comparable contamination profiles of edcs in luppe sediments have been reported in sediments in rural urbanized or industrialized areas worldwide mostly identifying np e1 e2 and ee2 but also bpa and other alkyphenols as the active compounds and were exceeded by at least a factor of four in the present study peck et al 2004 schmitt et al 2012 viganò et al 2008 the fact that np banned from eu countries was detected in water samples of the luppe by lc ms ms in the current study demonstrates how sediment contamination might negatively impact water quality the results from the present study highlight the importance of integrating sediment risk assessment in current legislation such as the wfd however currently there are no sediment quality guidelines sqgs and eqss established for edcs or other chemical pollutants worldwide brack et al 2017 several comprehensive methods and approaches for establishing sqgs for edcs have suggested the combined use of chemical analytical techniques and ebms such as bioassays kwok et al 2014 macdonald et al 2000 furthermore ebms have been recommended for implementation in the wfd in order to bridge the gap between chemical contamination and ecological effects brack et al 2019 the p yes used in the current study was demonstrated to be a robust and fast screening tool for the detection of ecs that is applicable to sediment extracts and provides information about the quality in terms of eeqs and the quantities of target ecs in environmental samples moreover data obtained in the present study by the p yes were comparable to conventional chemical analysis but had an advantage in that they had lower lods and loqs another question addressed in this study was whether sediment bound ecs might become bioavailable under turbulent conditions such as a flood event passive sampling was used to evaluate the bioavailability of ecs from suspensions of luppe sediment since it targets freely dissolved concentrations of ecs freely dissolved compounds represent the effective concentration for diffusive transport and partitioning and thus is generally assumed to be bioavailable for organisms rand 1995 two types of passive sampling devices pocis and chemcatcher were evaluated for their suitability to determine freely dissolved concentrations of ecs in sediment suspension systems chemcatcher exhibited as reported by previous studies higher sampling rates compared to the pocis that favors monitoring of shorter time frames during which flood events might occur under field conditions the sampler calibration performed in the present study was simplified compared to other calibration studies vermeirssen et al 2013 since only a few data points four were used for linear regression however it was not within the scope of the current study to focus on the determination of ecs sampling rates but rather the aim was to derive rs values suitable for studying bioavailability of sediment borne ecs under conditions close to that of the calibration the sampling rate for the target compounds e1 e2 ee2 and np derived from laboratory calibration with pocis and chemcatcher were in the range of previously reported values for these sampling devices alvarez et al 2007 li et al 2010 skodova et al 2016 vermeirssen et al 2013 although successful sampling of np with the pocis has been reported in the past e g linear uptake li et al 2010 the non linear uptake kinetics for np in pocis observed in the present study is also supported by similar findings described in other publications vallejo et al 2013 moreover e1 and np were depleted in the sediment suspension 5gdw l experiments with the chemcatcher suspension test b c our results suggest that the uptake of the freely dissolved substances in the water into the chemcatcher in this experimental setup was faster than the dissociation of the substance from the suspended sediment this effect is important to consider in laboratory studies with a defined amount of sediment but might be negligible under field conditions where the sediment acts as an infinite source regardless the usefulness of passive sampling devices in the monitoring of environmental concentrations of edcs in the context of water quality but also sediment impacts has been demonstrated in a number of studies novák et al 2018 vermeirssen et al 2005 and is further supported by the results of the current study with regard to the monitoring ecs in suspended sediment the bioavailability of ecs inferred by the measure of dissolved concentrations of np e1 e2 and ee2 in the sediment suspension experiments ranged from 2 up to 27 freely dissolved concentrations of np were approximately 250 fold greater during suspension of sediment than under static conditions measured in water samples of the luppe river the results of the present study highlight the importance of considering remobilisation and bioavailability of sediment bound ecs in terms of flood events and demonstrate how a sink for pollutants can turn into a source moreover np and e1 in the test water were present at environmentally relevant concentrations np 18 6 μg l and e1 19 1 ng l in which adverse effects on fish health and reproduction have been documented in field and laboratory studies a three week exposure to concentrations of 30 μg l np caused significant elevations of up to 1000 fold vtg induction in male rainbow trout accompanied by inhibited testicular growth and disturbed spermatogenic development in testes jobling et al 1996 similar findings were reported by thorpe et al 2000 who reported induction of vtg in juvenile rainbow trout after 14 days of exposure to 16 μg l np comparable exposure studies conducted with rainbow trout exposed to e1 showed vtg induction at 3 3 ng l after 14 days thorpe et al 2003 or 50 ng l after 21 days routledge et al 1998 although many edcs including np and e1 reveal lower estrogenic potencies relative to e2 or ee2 in terms of biomarker induction additive effects have been observed for exposure to mixtures of edcs thorpe et al 2003 however the magnitude of edcs exposure in fish is strongly dependent on life stage duration concentrations uptake routes and species sensitivity high amounts of suspended particular matter spm were found in rainbow trout intestine after exposure to suspended sediment and can thus serve as an additional route of exposure hudjetz et al 2014 our results indicate that despite the presence of environmentally relevant concentrations of freely dissolved ecs in the water major parts of the estrogenic activity during re suspension of sediment are still attributed to spm thus it is important to not only consider the estrogenic activity of freely dissolved concentrations of edcs in the water phase but also of the sediment phase e g spm when assessing the risks of remobilized edcs to fish in the context of flood events 5 conclusion our results show that ecs accumulated in river sediments but can be remobilized and become readily bioavailable for aquatic organisms when sediment is re suspended while further research is needed to investigate and quantify possible adverse effects of remobilized sediment bound ecs on biota our findings suggest that events like flooding have the potential to remobilize dormant contaminant loads from sediments increased bioavailability of sediment bound ecs during remobilization events may result in concentrations that cause long term adverse effects on the ecosystem future research should address the remobilization potential in the context of sediment composition with special emphasis on particle size and toc content of sediment competing interests

18712,studies worldwide have demonstrated through in vitro bioassays and chemical analysis that endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs can accumulate in river sediments however remobilization of sediment bound edcs due to bioturbation or re suspension during flood events remains poorly understood the aim of this study was to evaluate the bioavailability of edcs more specifically estrogenic compounds ec from sediment under turbulent conditions using a passive sampling approach sediment was sampled along the luppe river germany previously described as a hotspot for ecs the concentration of target

european monitoring network norman a basic bioassay battery has been suggested including in vitro tests for estrogenic activity brack et al 2019 escher et al 2018 moreover studies across europe investigating the fate and distribution of edcs in the environment have demonstrated using in vitro bioassays and chemical analytical methods that edcs sorb to suspended particles and thus accumulate

chemicals were e1 followed by e2 they concluded that sediments act as sinks for edcs more specifically estrogenic compounds ec which is to be expected due to the hydrophobic e g high log kow properties of many edcs even higher estrogenic activity in terms of ee2 equivalents eeeqs ranging from 0 25 up to 55 μg eeeq kg were reported from the yes assay by buchinger et al 2013b in a sediment survey along the saale river and its tributaries in germany moreover high levels of np and e1 were detected by lc and gc ms ms and found to contribute most to the observed estrogenic activity from the german river sediments while it has been recognized that ecs have a high tendency to accumulate in sediment little is known about their bioavailability and potential for remobilization transport and redistribution due to extreme weather events such as floods bioturbation or dredging however some studies indicate that estrogenic compounds have the potential to be remobilised from sediments during floods as shown by estrogen related endpoints oetken et al 2005 the frequency and intensity of flood events is predicted to increase in the context of global climate change petrow and merz 2009 on account of this the european parliament initiated the directive 2007 60 ec regarding the assessment and management of flood risks whereby they established a framework aiming to assess and reduce the adverse consequences of floods for human health and the environment eu 2007 60 ec one major aspect of such risk assessment includes the evaluation of sediment contamination and the potential of contaminant remobilization from sediments whereby the sink might turn into a source of pollution hollert et al 2007 it has been recognized that good chemical status and good ecological status according to the wfd is not always attainable due to sediment contamination and recommendations for improvements have included the establishment of environmental quality standards eqs for sediments that consider the bioavailability of sediment contaminants brack et al 2017 bioavailability has been described as the portion of the total quantity or concentration of a chemical in the environment that is potentially available for biological action such as uptake by an organism concentration of freely dissolved organic compounds such as ecs are generally assumed to be more readily available for uptake in an organism and thus bioavailable in water rand 1995 the bioavailability of sediment bound ecs was examined in the present study under turbulent conditions in order to estimate the risk of remobilized ecs to fish during flood events specifically the objectives of the present study as a part of the interdisciplinary project house water consortium crawford et al 2017 were to investigate 1 the accumulation of ecs and their activity in river sediment and 2 the potential of these compounds to be remobilized from the sediment under turbulent conditions such as in a flood event and thus become bioavailable for fish the luppe river was chosen as a worst case scenario for sediment borne ec contamination based on the high levels of np and e1 previously reported by buchinger et al 2013b the recently developed planar yes assay buchinger et al 2013a which combines high performance thin layer chromatography hptlc with the traditional in vitro yes assay was used in addition to chemical analysis lc ms ms to investigate concentrations of ecs and associated estrogenic activity in sediment samples along the luppe river two types of passive samplers were used to assess the bioavailability of ecs specifically e1 e2 ee2 and np from this sediment under turbulent conditions in sediment suspension experiments polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis and chemcatcher

activity of the sediment extracts redissolved in dmso was investigated using the yes assay iso fdis 19040 1 2018 03 2018 kunz et al 2017 prior to testing with the yes samples were diluted 1 100 with milli q water to a final assay concentration of 1 dmso which is tolerated by the bioassay thus final sediment equivalents in the test were 25 mg ml each sample was measured at seven dilution levels with four technical replicates negative control process control and e2 standard in seven dilutions were included at least three independent replicates were performed per sample the estrogenic activity of the samples was calculated using the e2 standard and is expressed in 17β estradiol equivalents ng eeq l by multiplying ng eeq l by a factor of 40 the results are expressed as eeq kg sediment additionally samples from 2016 were tested in a planar yes p yes assay the general procedure of the p yes has previously been described in detail elsewhere briefly extracts were diluted 1 10 and applied on a hptlc plate in volumes of 5 μl using an automatic tlc sampler 4 ats 4 camag subsequently the hptlc plates were chromatographically developed in two steps using an automated multiple development system amd 2 camag then the yes assay was performed directly on the surface of the hptlc plate by spraying a yeast cell suspension previously adjusted to 2000 50 formazin attenuation units onto the plate four to eight dilutions of a reference substance mixture np e1 e2 ee2 and estriol e3 were included on each plate for calibration purposes to express the signals detected in the sample in terms of eeqs this allows a quantitative assessment of the agonistic potential of the sample in addition to the qualitative assessment the calculation of the equivalent concentration of the individual signals detected in the samples was based on the inverse five parameter log logistic function of the reference compound subsequently values are expressed in ng kg or ng l of the original sample considering the enrichment factor application volume and pre dilution three independent replicates were performed on different days using separate aliquots of yeast suspension 2 5 pocis and chemcatcher laboratory calibration a laboratory calibration for e1 e2 ee2 and np was performed with pocis and chemcatcher pocis consisted of a membrane sorbent membrane sandwich see figure a1 to obtain a surface area per mass of sorbent ratio of 180 cm2 g as described in alvarez et al 2007 54 5 0 5 mg oasis hlb was sandwiched between two pes membranes 9 8 cm2 surface area held in place by compression between two stainless steel washers empore disks were mounted similarly between two stainless steel washers conditioning of hlb and chemcatcher were done according to alvarez et al 2007 and skodova et al 2016 for further information see appendix the calibration of both the pocis and chemcatcher was performed using a static renewal exposure setup in which the samplers were exposed to the target compounds under stirred conditions ca 300 rev min at 20 2 c in darkness one single chemcatcher was applied per beaker with 1 l milli q water spiked with a nominal concentration of 5 μg l of e1 e2 ee2 and 4n np and stirred by a magnetic stirrer at 300 rev min at 20 c the water was renewed every day and the ph measured chemcatchers were removed after exposure times of 2 4 7 or 10 days duplicates were done per time point additionally a water control without chemicals was included calibration of pocis was done similarly with slight modifications four pocis were applied per beaker with 1 l milli q water spiked with 5 μg l of each substance and exposed for 4 7 14 and 21 days pocis calibration was performed in triplicate per sampling time point and one control exposed to water only was included per sampling time point exposed pocis and chemcatcher were extracted individually according to alvarez et al 2007 skodova et al 2016 see appendix before extraction 5 μg deuterated e2 ee2 and 4n np standards were added to each sampler target substances were determined using lc ms ms to verify the nominal water concentration of 5 μg l water samples were taken at several time points throughout the chemcatcher calibration experiment sampling rates were approximated as linear uptake using the slope of the linear regression of the amount of substance found in each sampler plotted against the sampling time points see eq a1 rs for pocis were calculated using an iterative approach to correct for the changing number of samplers during the exposure eq a2 a5 and figure a2 2 6 suspended sediment experiment to investigate the bioavailability of ecs np e1 e2 ee2 present in luppe sediment 5 g d w from sampling site luppe1 2017 was taken sieved to 2 mm and suspended in 1 l of tap water the sediment was stirred at 300 rpm at 20 c for 24 h in the dark to allow for equilibration before a passive sampler was added to the sediment suspension individual pocis and chemcatcher samplers were exposed for 10 or 5 days respectively to the suspended sediment under constant stirring suspension test a it is possible that the samplers would cause a depletion of the target compounds in the water phase during the time of exposure or that the system would not be able to sustain the equilibrium state over several days therefore a depletion test was conducted where a pair of each pocis or chemcatcher were successively exposed to the same suspended sediment for 10 or 5 days respectively as a first step single chemcatcher or pocis were exposed as described above suspension test b after their removal a new set of samplers were individually deployed into the same suspended sediment this experiment was repeated for the chemcatcher suspension test c all sediment exposure experiments with pocis and chemcatcher suspension test a c were performed in duplicates upon removal all samplers were cleaned carefully with deionized water before extraction as described above target analysis was done by lc ms ms the amount of internal standard for lc ms ms was 50 ng deuterated standard mix of e2 ee2 and np for all tests with sediment in addition one chemcatcher extract was tested in the p yes as described above time weighted average concentrations in the water ng l ctwa were calculated using the experimentally determined respective sampling rates and eq a1 the mass distribution of the different ecs was used as an indicator for bioavailability in this study setup and was estimated as 1 m a s s d i s t r i b u t i o n c t w a v w c s m s 100 where the initial concentration in sediment ng g is expressed as cs mass of sediment g as ms and water volume l as vw 2 7 quantification by lc ms ms identification and quantification of target substances e1 e2 ee2 and np was done by mass spectrometry with a ltq orbitrap xl equipped with a heated electron spray ionization hesi ion source performed in positive ionization mode detailed information see appendix normalization of the response to compensate fluctuations in ionization and derivatization efficiency were conducted with deuterated standards limit of quantification loq and detection lod were calculated according to alvarez 2010 as 3 and 7 fold respectively the standard deviation sd of the mean blank concentration of the compound table a2 blank samples were produced by using solvents and derivatization without passive sampler 3 results 3 1 accumulation of ecs and related estrogenic activity along the luppe river sediment along the luppe river was characterized by particle size distribution as clayey silt with a high total organic carbon toc content of 9 except for sampling sites 2 and 5 which had 3 toc and were classified as loamy or silty sand table a1 estrogenic activity expressed as eeq in sediments measured by the yes varied along the luppe eeqs found at sampling sites 1 3 and 4 17 5 1 5 15 3 0 9 and 20 1 2 5 μg eeq kg were relatively high compared to sites 5 8 1 0 5 μg eeq kg and 2 3 4 0 2 μg eeq kg which were about 2 5 and 6 times lower respectively fig 2 measured eeqs were found to be three times higher during the resampling of site 1 a year later table 1 moreover in all luppe sediment extracts three or even four distinct fluorescence signals could be detected after separation by hptlc followed by subsequent p yes the retention times r f of these signals aligned with the standard compounds r f np 0 819 0 010 e1 0 681 0 014 ee2 0 567 0 010 e2 0 4233 0 0079 figure a3 shows the hptlc plate after chromatographic and yes development considering the corresponding r f as well as the reporter assay induction np e1 and e2 were found in all luppe sediments whereas ee2 was only present in samples from sites 1 and 2 included negative and process controls were below the limit of detection for both tests the p yes and yes see figure a3 blank quantitative evaluation of the p yes revealed high concentrations of np 8 7 up to 37 6 mg kg and e1 5 7 up to 92 4 μg kg whereas e2 and ee2 when found ranged from 0 1 up to 0 9 μg kg or 0 03 0 04 μg kg respectively fluorescence signals for the compounds np e1 and ee2 that were found in the sediment extracts were compared to the corresponding e2 signal to evaluate their relative potency in eeqs these qualitative results are summarized in fig 2 where the area of the circles is proportional to the measured yes eeqs in μg eeq kg and the slices are proportional to the corresponding eeqs for the single substances relative contributions of the four target ecs to the sediment estrogenic activity were uniform along the luppe river fig 2 e1 accounted for approx 50 of the total estrogenic effects in μg eeqs kg measured via p yes followed by np accounting for approx 35 although only low concentrations of e2 were detected in the luppe sediments due to the high potency e2 accounted for approx 14 of the estrogenic effect finally the estrogenic effect attributed to ee2 when present was negligible approx 1 from sediment across all luppe sampling sites target compound analysis with lc ms ms confirmed the presence of np e1 and e2 in sediment extracts from sampling site 1 whereas ee2 was not detected above the limit of detection concentrations for np and e1 were comparable with both methods p yes as well as lc ms ms see table 1 whereas e2 could be detected but not quantified by means of lc ms ms additionally np 75 4 ng l and e1 19 7 ng l were both detected by means of lc ms ms in water samples from the luppe river at sampling site 1 calculated sediment partition coefficients kd between water and sediment kd ctwa cs were 0 001 for np and 0 067 for e1 indicating strong association of these substances with the sediment phase 3 2 calibration of pocis and chemcatcher laboratory calibration of pocis and chemcatcher was performed to determine sampling rates rs for the four target compounds np e1 e2 and ee2 uptake of these compounds into chemcatcher and pocis over time using a static renewal system with spiked water is shown in figure a 4 both passive sampling devices exhibited an integrative linear uptake for the steroids and np over time r2 ranged from 0 98 to 0 99 except for uptake of np in pocis in which no linear uptake was observed water concentration cw of all spiked compounds before sampler deployment t0 differed up to 25 from nominal water concentration of 5 μg l table 2 cw for all compounds after 24 h of sampling by chemcatcher were reduced by at least a factor of three temperature was constant during the whole experiment at 20 c and ph was 5 6 all negative controls in both chemcatcher and pocis calibration had concentrations that were below the lod data obtained from the laboratory calibrations were used to calculate rs as described above and in the supplementary information rs values of chemcatcher varied between 0 53 and 0 66 l d whereas rs values obtained for pocis were approx seven times lower ranging from 0 081 to 0 093 l d table 2 3 3 bioavailability of ecs from sediment under turbulent conditions e1 and np were found in the water phase in all sediment re mobilization tests evaluated by passive sampling with both pocis and chemcatcher and subsequent lc ms ms analysis however neither e2 nor ee2 could be directly detected by lc ms ms ctwa were calculated for np and e1 based on the experimentally determined rs values see eq a1 except for np in the pocis due to the missing calibration discussed above calculated ctwa for e1 were comparable between pocis and chemcatcher and varied from 9 3 up to 28 8 ng l and 7 5 up to 22 3 ng l between the suspension tests a c respectively table 3 the calculated ctwa for np ranged from 2 2 to 28 0 μg l between the suspension tests a c and were about 1000 times higher compared to e1 the equilibrium capacity of the sediment was investigated by consecutive deployment of passive samplers within a constant sediment water system the pocis did not deplete e1 from the sediment water re suspension system since the calculated ctwa did not differ significantly mann whitney test p 0 60 between the first 28 8 6 3 ng l and second 24 8 5 0 ng l sampling period 10 d later in contrast the ctwa of both e1 and np for the chemcatcher were about 2 6 1 0 4 ng l and 8 3 5 2 8 ng l times lower respectively after the second sampling period mann whitney test p 0 028 fig 3 the chemcatcher therefore depleted e1 and np from the re suspension system used in this experimental setup however the mass distribution as an indicator for the bioavailability in this study was comparable between the two passive sampling systems for e1 varying between 2 5 and 9 8 greater bioavailability was observed for np with 17 8 ending up in the dissolved phase in addition to lc ms ms analysis one single chemcatcher extract was investigated in the p yes in this extract e1 4 8 ng l e2 0 2 ng l ee2 0 5 ng l and np 24 5 μg l were detected based on comparison to the included standard compounds 4 discussion in the present study concentrations of ecs accumulated in sediments along the luppe river which had earlier been described as a hotspot for ec contamination could be related to the corresponding estrogenic activity we used a novel screening tool p yes which combines high performance thin layer chromatography with an in vitro bioassay yes to conclude that mostly e1 and np accounted for the high estrogenic activity found in the luppe sediments eeqs as well as concentrations of ecs determined for sediments along the luppe river in the present study were similar to that previously found at the same sampling site 55 μg eeeq kg np 115 mg kg e1 20 4 μg kg e2 1 5 μg kg buchinger et al 2013b the fact that our findings agree with the previous study provides further support for the assumption of buchinger et al 2013b that the sediment associated estrogenic activity of the luppe is historical rather than the result of modern sources of input despite the overall high estrogenic activity along the river course determined from the current study measured activities at sampling site 2 and 5 appeared to be lower compared to the other sites the lower estrogenic activity might be explained by the differences in physicochemical properties of the sediment among the sites with the sediment type at these sites having less fine particles approx 20 less silt 3 fold lower toc content and more sandy material compared to the other sites table a1 the findings of our study agree with previous literature reports which showed that ec concentrations and estrogenic activity are higher in fractions of fine particles and that organic matter has a significant influence on the sorption of ecs to sediment yamamoto et al 2003 the fact that ee2 was only detected in sediment samples from site 1 and 2 indicates that ee2 pollution might result from a different source of this pollutant possibly from surrounding households or sewage treatment plants adeel et al 2017 moreover the 3 fold higher estrogenic activity in luppe sediment from 2017 compared to 2016 together with the unchanged np and e1 concentrations might indicate that additional ecs contribute to the estrogenic activity in luppe sediment from 2017 in agreement with buchinger et al 2013b the present study demonstrates that the luppe serves as a hotspot for ecs with contamination in sediments exceeding the mean estrogenic activity found in the nearby catchment area of the saale river by at least 37 times comparable contamination profiles of edcs in luppe sediments have been reported in sediments in rural urbanized or industrialized areas worldwide mostly identifying np e1 e2 and ee2 but also bpa and other alkyphenols as the active compounds and were exceeded by at least a factor of four in the present study peck et al 2004 schmitt et al 2012 viganò et al 2008 the fact that np banned from eu countries was detected in water samples of the luppe by lc ms ms in the current study demonstrates how sediment contamination might negatively impact water quality the results from the present study highlight the importance of integrating sediment risk assessment in current legislation such as the wfd however currently there are no sediment quality guidelines sqgs and eqss established for edcs or other chemical pollutants worldwide brack et al 2017 several comprehensive methods and approaches for establishing sqgs for edcs have suggested the combined use of chemical analytical techniques and ebms such as bioassays kwok et al 2014 macdonald et al 2000 furthermore ebms have been recommended for implementation in the wfd in order to bridge the gap between chemical contamination and ecological effects brack et al 2019 the p yes used in the current study was demonstrated to be a robust and fast screening tool for the detection of ecs that is applicable to sediment extracts and provides information about the quality in terms of eeqs and the quantities of target ecs in environmental samples moreover data obtained in the present study by the p yes were comparable to conventional chemical analysis but had an advantage in that they had lower lods and loqs another question addressed in this study was whether sediment bound ecs might become bioavailable under turbulent conditions such as a flood event passive sampling was used to evaluate the bioavailability of ecs from suspensions of luppe sediment since it targets freely dissolved concentrations of ecs freely dissolved compounds represent the effective concentration for diffusive transport and partitioning and thus is generally assumed to be bioavailable for organisms rand 1995 two types of passive sampling devices pocis and chemcatcher were evaluated for their suitability to determine freely dissolved concentrations of ecs in sediment suspension systems chemcatcher exhibited as reported by previous studies higher sampling rates compared to the pocis that favors monitoring of shorter time frames during which flood events might occur under field conditions the sampler calibration performed in the present study was simplified compared to other calibration studies vermeirssen et al 2013 since only a few data points four were used for linear regression however it was not within the scope of the current study to focus on the determination of ecs sampling rates but rather the aim was to derive rs values suitable for studying bioavailability of sediment borne ecs under conditions close to that of the calibration the sampling rate for the target compounds e1 e2 ee2 and np derived from laboratory calibration with pocis and chemcatcher were in the range of previously reported values for these sampling devices alvarez et al 2007 li et al 2010 skodova et al 2016 vermeirssen et al 2013 although successful sampling of np with the pocis has been reported in the past e g linear uptake li et al 2010 the non linear uptake kinetics for np in pocis observed in the present study is also supported by similar findings described in other publications vallejo et al 2013 moreover e1 and np were depleted in the sediment suspension 5gdw l experiments with the chemcatcher suspension test b c our results suggest that the uptake of the freely dissolved substances in the water into the chemcatcher in this experimental setup was faster than the dissociation of the substance from the suspended sediment this effect is important to consider in laboratory studies with a defined amount of sediment but might be negligible under field conditions where the sediment acts as an infinite source regardless the usefulness of passive sampling devices in the monitoring of environmental concentrations of edcs in the context of water quality but also sediment impacts has been demonstrated in a number of studies novák et al 2018 vermeirssen et al 2005 and is further supported by the results of the current study with regard to the monitoring ecs in suspended sediment the bioavailability of ecs inferred by the measure of dissolved concentrations of np e1 e2 and ee2 in the sediment suspension experiments ranged from 2 up to 27 freely dissolved concentrations of np were approximately 250 fold greater during suspension of sediment than under static conditions measured in water samples of the luppe river the results of the present study highlight the importance of considering remobilisation and bioavailability of sediment bound ecs in terms of flood events and demonstrate how a sink for pollutants can turn into a source moreover np and e1 in the test water were present at environmentally relevant concentrations np 18 6 μg l and e1 19 1 ng l in which adverse effects on fish health and reproduction have been documented in field and laboratory studies a three week exposure to concentrations of 30 μg l np caused significant elevations of up to 1000 fold vtg induction in male rainbow trout accompanied by inhibited testicular growth and disturbed spermatogenic development in testes jobling et al 1996 similar findings were reported by thorpe et al 2000 who reported induction of vtg in juvenile rainbow trout after 14 days of exposure to 16 μg l np comparable exposure studies conducted with rainbow trout exposed to e1 showed vtg induction at 3 3 ng l after 14 days thorpe et al 2003 or 50 ng l after 21 days routledge et al 1998 although many edcs including np and e1 reveal lower estrogenic potencies relative to e2 or ee2 in terms of biomarker induction additive effects have been observed for exposure to mixtures of edcs thorpe et al 2003 however the magnitude of edcs exposure in fish is strongly dependent on life stage duration concentrations uptake routes and species sensitivity high amounts of suspended particular matter spm were found in rainbow trout intestine after exposure to suspended sediment and can thus serve as an additional route of exposure hudjetz et al 2014 our results indicate that despite the presence of environmentally relevant concentrations of freely dissolved ecs in the water major parts of the estrogenic activity during re suspension of sediment are still attributed to spm thus it is important to not only consider the estrogenic activity of freely dissolved concentrations of edcs in the water phase but also of the sediment phase e g spm when assessing the risks of remobilized edcs to fish in the context of flood events 5 conclusion our results show that ecs accumulated in river sediments but can be remobilized and become readily bioavailable for aquatic organisms when sediment is re suspended while further research is needed to investigate and quantify possible adverse effects of remobilized sediment bound ecs on biota our findings suggest that events like flooding have the potential to remobilize dormant contaminant loads from sediments increased bioavailability of sediment bound ecs during remobilization events may result in concentrations that cause long term adverse effects on the ecosystem future research should address the remobilization potential in the context of sediment composition with special emphasis on particle size and toc content of sediment competing interests

18713,pesticides are emerging contaminants frequently detected in the aquatic environment in this work a novel approach combining activated carbon adsorption oxygen plasma treatment and ozonation was studied for the removal of the persistent chlorinated pesticide alachlor a comparison was made between the removal efficiency and energy consumption for two different reactor operation modes batch recirculation and single pass mode the kinetics study revealed that the insufficient removal of alachlor by adsorption was significantly improved in terms of degradation efficiency and energy consumption when combined with the plasma treatment the best efficiency ca 80 removal with an energy cost of 19 4 kwh m ³ was found for the single pass operational mode of the reactor in the batch recirculating process a complete elimination of alachlor by plasma treatment was observed after 30 min of treatment analysis of the reactive species induced by plasma in aqueous solutions showed that the decomposition of alachlor mainly occurred through a radical oxidation mechanism with a minor contribution of long living oxidants o3 h2o2 investigation of the alachlor oxidation pathways revealed six different oxidation mechanisms including the loss of aromaticity which was never before reported for plasma assisted degradation of aromatic pesticides it was revealed that the removal rate and energy cost could be further improved with more than 50 by additional o3 gas bubbling in the solution reservoir keywords non thermal plasma pesticides alachlor oxidative species by products 1 introduction the strong global population growth combined with raising living standards in the last century has forced industries to the large scale production of pharmaceuticals organic pesticides plasticizers and other synthetic materials since 1970 these anthropogenic substances have been increasingly detected in the aquatic environment eggen et al 2014 among the different types of organic contaminants encountered in the environment pesticides occupy a unique position since they are mostly deliberately distributed pesticides are chemical compounds that have been mainly designed to protect crops against fungal or animal pests indeed their presence in the environment has been primary traced back to agricultural applications they are divided in several groups such as carbamates pyrethroids neonicotinoids organochlorine organophosphate and biopesticides marican durán lara 2018 for their transfer to water bodies several potential pathways need to be considered köck schulmeyer et al 2013 monitoring data have shown that pesticides are usually released into the environment by diffusive sources one of them includes the release into the surface water through surface runoff from agricultural fields after rainfall events next to that part of the pesticide load can be mobilized through the soil eventually ending up in the ground water secondary effluent originating from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants is considered to be the major point source of pesticides entering into the surface water luo et al 2014 given the high toxicity of most pesticides along with their persistency towards conventional biological water treatment activated carbon adsorption and chemical oxidation are currently considered as key technologies for the remediation of pesticide containing wastewaters ikehata el din 2005 luo et al 2014 although ozonation has proved to be effective in the removal of many organic pollutants it was shown that the vast majority of the pesticides cannot be fully removed with ozonation alone ikehata el din 2005 it should be stressed that in deionized water the highly selective nature of o3 only allows for a fast reaction with a limited set of organic compounds many important classes of crop protection chemicals such as the organochlorine pesticides contain multiple hetero atoms e g n p cl in their molecular structure and are thus stabilized against direct o3 attack in the case of organochlorine pesticides the values for the second order rate constants with o3 are usually below 20 m 1 s 1 von gunten 2003 wols and hofman caris 2012 furthermore the combination of multiple oxidants generally leads to a faster decomposition of target pollutants as compared to ozonation oturan and aaron 2014 a promising alternative for the abatement of recalcitrant pesticides involves the application of non thermal plasmas electrical discharges sustained at atmospheric pressure and near ambient temperature plasmas created in liquids or gas liquid environments produce various oxidising reactive species ho ho2 o o3 h2o2 which contribute to the removal of organic compounds from water bradu et al 2017 jiang et al 2014 tarabová et al 2018 in plasma reactors where the discharge is initiated in the gas phase such as the dielectric barrier discharge dbd reactor mass transfer is limited by the contact time of the solution under treatment in the plasma zone therefore the removal efficiency and implicitly its energy consumption is kinetically controlled by the diffusion rate of plasma generated oxidants in the liquid film magureanu et al 2016 better removal efficiencies and higher energy yields are usually achieved in reactor systems that combine plasma treatment with catalysts such as activated carbon qu et al 2009 in particular the improved performance of these so called plasma catalytic reactors is attributed to i the increased the residence time of the target compound and dissolved chemical components i e h2o2 and o3 on the catalyst surface compared to the bulk liquid phase due to adsorption and ii the generation of reactive oxygen species ros which facilitates pollutant oxidation previously we have reported the use of plasma assisted removal of alachlor in a dbd reactor combining plasma treatment with activated carbon adsorption vanraes et al 2018 in the present work the removal and energy efficiency of i adsorption ii adsorption coupled with plasma treatment and iii adsorption with plasma treatment and additional ozonation with plasma gas produced in the discharge are compared alachlor ala a chlorinated herbicide belonging to the chloroacetanilide family was chosen as the target pesticide although banned within the european union it is still largely detected in some parts of the world badriyha et al 2003 in addition ala is well studied in terms of removal by different advanced oxidation processes making it a fitting model compound because the remediation of pesticide containing wastewaters can either be carried out in reactors operated in a batch or single pass flow through configuration the performance of both reactor modes was compared in this study in terms of removal efficiency and energy costs the production of various chemical oxidants plasma induced reactive species was studied to obtain a better understanding of the underpinning mechanisms that contribute to ala elimination finally oxidation by products formed during the oxidation of the pesticide were identified and the degradation pathways were suggested 2 materials methods 2 1 chemicals dry oxygen 99 5 used as the feed gas in the plasma experiments was supplied by air liquide belgium alachlor ala 98 4 oxo 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidine 4 oxo temp 98 sulphuric acid h2so4 96 and titanium iv oxysulfate tioso4 98 were obtained from sigma aldrich belgium sodium azide nan3 99 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 v v and dichloromethane ch2cl2 99 were purchased from carl roth belgium all chemicals and solvents were used as received 2 2 solution preparation a saturated ala solution was prepared by dissolving 50 mg of ala powder in 100 ml of deionized water the solution was stirred for 3 h filtrated and finally diluted with deionized water to obtain a working solution with 1 mg l 1 ala solution which was used in the experiments it should be noted that the ala concentration of 1 mg l 1 used in this work is higher than expected for real contaminated water conditions higher initial pollutant concentration usually results in the competition of the target compound with the by products and the wastewater constituents i e dissolved organic compounds for the reaction with the oxidative species as explained in wardenier et al 2019 therefore for real wastewater treatment the application efficiency of the process studied here may be higher than the energy costs reported in section 3 2 3 experimental setup both the batch recirculation and single pass experiments were carried out in the plasma ozonation reactor fig 1 the detailed setup description is found elsewhere vanraes et al 2018 wardenier et al 2019 the reactor system consisted of a solution reservoir connected in series with a dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma reactor with cylindrical geometry the plasma reactor consisted of a stainless steel tube covered by one layer of zorflex activated carbon textile with 0 5 mm thickness and was mounted in the centre of a quartz glass vessel a copper mesh wrapped around the quartz vessel served as high voltage hv electrode dry oxygen was supplied at the bottom of the plasma chamber which served as plasma feed gas in all experiments the gas flow rate was fixed at 1 standard liter per minute slm using a bronckhorst mass flow controller giving a gas residence time of 1 98 s in the discharge zone the length of the discharge region was 150 mm with a discharge gap of 2 25 mm and discharge volume of 33 1 cm³ the high voltage electrode was connected to an alternating current ac power supply generating sinusoidal voltage at a frequency of 50 khz and a peak to peak voltage of 8000 v in order to improve the discharge stability the power supply was triggered by a pulse generator thurbly instruments which modulated the sinusoidal voltage waveform with a square wave function the modulated waveform was characterized by a plasma on time of 4 5 ms and a period ton toff of 25 5 ms corresponding to a duty cycle of dc ton ton toff 0 15 the applied voltage was measured using a tektronix p6015 high voltage probe while the total current was recorded by an ionphysics current probe voltage and current waveforms were sampled by a tektronix td 1002 digital oscilloscope the total input power p dissipated into the plasma could then be determined by multiplying the duty cycle with the power generated during one period of voltage p0 as shown in eq 1 1 p p 0 dc 2 4 reactor configurations experiments were conducted in the batch configuration to study the effect of i adsorption ii adsorption combined with plasma treatment and iii plasma ozonation on the removal of ala prior to treatment the solution reservoir was filled with 500 ml of a 1 mg l 1 ala solution the solution was continuously recirculated between the plasma chamber and the solution reservoir at a flow rate of 56 3 ml min 1 corresponding to a residence time of 8 9 min and 2 09 s in the solution reservoir and the plasma chamber respectively kovacevic et al 2017 details about the calculation method are given in text s1 in the supplementary material aliquots of 20 ml were sampled from the reservoir at different time points 0 2 5 5 10 15 20 25 30 min and subjected to various analyses see section 2 5 and text s2 in the supplementary material taking samples during the batch experiments reduces the total solution volume under treatment the error induced this way on the calculated reaction rate and eeo was determined to be less than 5 the plasma gas produced at the exhaust of the plasma chamber was either vented or bubbled through the solution reservoir via a porous ceramic ozone dispenser during plasma ozonation experiments the removal of ala by adsorption on the activated carbon textile was studied by recirculating the solution between both reactor chambers with the plasma switched off single pass experiments were conducted in the same experimental set up and under similar operational settings as used for the batch recirculating experiments to allow the solution under treatment to pass through the plasma reactor only once the reservoir was disconnected from the set up and the solution was continuously fed from the influent reservoir into the plasma chamber ala removal by adsorption on zorflex was measured after 10 s of operation subsequently the plasma was switched on and samples were taken from the reactor outlet at identical time steps as in the batch experiments to evaluate the performance of the reactor system the removal efficiency and energy consumption of each distinct process was determined the removal efficiency r is defined as the ratio between the amount of ala degraded in the reactor and the initial pollutant concentration eq 2 2 r c 0 c t c 0 100 c0 is the initial ala concentration and ct the concentration detected in solution after a given treatment time energy consumption calculated for 90 removal is determined by the electrical energy per order ee o figure of merit and is defined by eqs 3 and 4 for the batch recirculating and the single pass configuration respectively bolton and tumas 1996 3 ee o batch p t 1000 v

description of the analytical procedures gaseous o3 in the exhaust gas stream generated at the outlet of the plasma reactor and the solution reservoir was continuously monitored by a specially developed on line ozone monitor text s2 section 2 1 in supplementary material in the liquid phase epr measurements were carried out in order to detect the presence of o 1o2 and o3 gorbanev et al 2016a b gorbanev et al 2018 for the quantification of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the titaniumoxysulphate method was used tarabová et al 2018 further details are provided in text s2 section 2 2 and fig s2 in the supplementary material 3 results discussion 3 1 alachlor removal kinetics table 1 summarizes the ala removal efficiency and energy consumption observed after adsorption and adsorption combined with plasma treatment in the single pass configuration the percentage of removal and ee osingle pass values found at different time intervals after plasma ignition along with a typical concentration profile is shown in table s1 and fig s3 in the supplementary material in the single pass experiment 39 removal was observed by adsorption alone as shown in table 1 and fig s3 although adsorption aided in the removal of ala it must be noted that the target compound decomposition did not occur ala was only transferred from the solution to the activated carbon surface at longer exposure times continuous adsorption of ala on the activated carbon membrane would result in a decreased adsorption capacity ultimately requiring a replacement of the carbon textile effective decomposition of ala can only occur when activated carbon adsorption is combined with an advanced oxidation process such as plasma treatment once the plasma was initiated the ala removal efficiency was increased reaching ca 80 under steady state conditions corresponding to an energy cost of 19 4 1 5 kwh m ³ for an initial ala concentration of 1 mg l 1 the increase in removal efficiency during the first 10 min of operation illustrates that the residence time of the ala molecules in the discharge zone is much higher i e several minutes than the hydraulic residence time hrt of the solution calculated from the assumption of a smooth laminar flow 2 09 s kovacevic et al 2017 according to the literature steady state concentrations are usually achieved within 3 5 times the hydraulic residence time hrt gerrity et al 2010 ajo et al 2016 following this line of thought the ala residence time in the plasma reactor is estimated to be in the range 2 3 min probably the difference in residence time between the solution and the ala molecules in the discharge zone is due to the continuous process of adsorption and desorption of ala on the carbon surface when passing through the reactor this in turn enhances the probability of interactions between the plasma generated oxidants and the alachlor molecules adsorbed on the activated carbon textile the removal of ala by adsorption plasma treatment and plasma ozonation during treatment in the batch recirculating configuration is shown in fig 2 similarly to the single pass configuration lowest removal efficiency was found for ala adsorption on zorflex accounting for 88 2 removal after 30 min of treatment a faster elimination of ala was found during plasma treatment and plasma ozonation where complete elimination was observed after 30 and 15 min of operation respectively when present in low concentrations 100 mg l 1 the elimination of organic compounds from water with advanced oxidation processes aops or plasma treatment obeys a pseudo first order kinetics bolton and tumas 1996 hence the rate law describing pollutant decomposition reads as eq 5 5 dc dt k c with c the pollutant concentration mol l t treatment time s and k the pseudo first order rate constant s 1 the solution of eq 5 c c 0 e k t suggests an exponential decay in alachlor concentration as a function of treatment time which is consistent with the shape of the alachlor decomposition profile shown in fig 2 the pseudo first order rate constant was obtained by fitting experimental data shown in fig 2 to eq 5 by means of nonlinear least squares regression following the levenberg marquardt algorithm to check the assumption of alachlor decomposition described by a pseudo first order kinetics table s2 in the supplementary material compares the computed rate constants and correlation coefficients r2 obtained from the fitting of the data with a zeroth order pseudo first order and second order kinetic model a satisfactory agreement was found between the experimental data and the model predictions obtained from the pseudo first order kinetic model r2 0 998 for the three fittings whereas the r2 values were smaller for the zeroth second order kinetic models r2 0 94 this justifies the use of a pseudo first order kinetic model for the accurate prediction of the alachlor decomposition the rate constant k 0 299 0 0102 min 1 obtained in the plasma ozonation setup is more than twice as high compared to the value found during plasma treatment alone k 0 134 0 0055 min 1 based on the kinetic data presented in fig 2 the energy consumption is found to be 23 4 kwh m ³ and 10 4 kwh m ³ for the elimination of ala by plasma and plasma ozonation respectively thus it is evident that the bubbling of the excess plasma gas mainly containing ozone throughout the solution reservoir is beneficial to achieve a better removal efficiency and a lower energy consumption 3 2 production of reactive species by plasma plasma assisted decomposition of organic compounds is typically a complex process that involves the participation of multiple oxidising reagents such as reactive oxygen species ros in a gas phase plasma sustained in a humid o2 atmosphere collisions between the electrons and the gas molecules o2 h2o initiate the production of oxidising species including various radicals ho ho2 o h excited species 1o2 neutral molecules o3 h2o2 h2 and charged ions o o2 o4 ho h h ho o o2 o4 through a series of chemical reactions bradu et al 2017 jiang et al 2014 reactive species generated in the gas phase then diffuse in the liquid where they initiate secondary reactions for reactor systems that combine plasma treatment with activated carbon adsorption organic pollutant elimination can take place simultaneously in the plasma liquid interface the bulk liquid and on the catalyst surface a plausible pathway describing the decomposition of organic compounds was put forward by jiang et al 2014 and is summarized in reactions r1 r8 first micropollutants present in the bulk liquid phase diffuse from the bulk liquid to the activated carbon surface where a fraction of the initial ala concentration is adsorbed r 1 the adsorption efficiency depends on the nature of the target compound as described in vanraes et al 2018 from the results obtained from single pass experiment summarized in table 1 it could be deduced that about 49 is removed from the solution by adsorption on the zorflex textile after one pass through the reactor hereby the accumulation of ala at the active carbon textile results in a local micropollutant concentration in the region near the plasma liquid interface resulting in a higher probability for interactions with the plasma generated oxidants present in the liquid phase furthermore it is important to stress that activated carbon itself also catalyses the decomposition of long living oxidants o3 h2o2 present in the bulk liquid through a series of reactions r 2 r 7 generating highly reactive radicals in solution and attached to the adsorption material which can contribute to the elimination of ala this leads to the self regeneration of activated carbon and thus prolongs the lifetime of the activated carbon textile indeed several works have suggested the use of plasma technology for the regeneration of activated carbon gushchin et al 2018 jiang et al 2014 qu et al 2009 tang et al 2018 r 1 ac m ac m r 2 o 3 h ac h ac o h 2 o 2 r 3 o 3 ac oh o 2 ac ho r 4 o 3 ac o 2 o ac r 5 o 3 ac o ac o 2 o ac r 6 ac h 2 o 2 ac ho ho r 7 ac h 2 o 2 ac h ho 2 r 8 ac m ho ac p to elucidate the role that oxidising species can play in the elimination of ala the contribution of various chemical oxidants to ala removal was studied in the following sections 3 2 1 hydrogen peroxide in batch mode fig 3 illustrates the formation of h2o2 in the liquid phase for the batch recirculating configuration a linear increase of h2o2 concentration was observed in deionized water reaching a concentration of ca 220 μm while a higher amount 272 μm of h2o2 was formed in the presence of ala after 30 min of treatment a similar finding i e a higher concentration of h2o2 in the presence of an organic compound dissolved in deionized water was previously reported in a pulsed corona discharge magureanu et al 2016 it is well documented that hydrogen peroxide is mainly formed from radical radical recombination reactions in the plasma treated liquid r 9 10 following this consideration the detection of h2o2 in solution indirectly confirmed the presence of radical species ho ho2 as an additional source in gas phase discharge part of the h2o2 found in the liquid might be attributed to the direct transfer of h2o2 from the gas phase plasma to the liquid due to its high henry s constant hcc 1 92 106 lietz and kushner 2016 heirman et al 2019 r 9 ho ho h 2 o 2 r 10 ho 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 franclemont et al 2015 reported h2o2 concentrations up to 800 μm in a pulsed corona discharge directly in the liquid while sarangapani et al 2017 observed a smaller amount of h2o2 490 μm in a dbd reactor fed with air further kovacevic et al 2017 showed that the production of h2o2 in a liquid film reactor depends on the nature of the feed gas the authors observed the largest h2o2 concentration in pure ar 588 μm on the contrary a slightly smaller concentration of h2o2 could be detected during air plasma treatment 441 μm the latter is explained by the consumption of h2o2 due to the reaction with nitrite no2 which takes place in an acidic environment the efficiency of h2o2 generation in plasma reactor is often expressed by the h2o2 energy yield g kwh 1 in the review of locke and shih 2011 h2o2 energy yields were summarized for a variety of plasma reactors h2o2 energy yields up to 80 g kwh 1 were reported for reactor configurations where the plasma was generated in the liquid while in most dbd reactors energy yield was calculated to be around 2 70 g kwh 1 in this study the h2o2 yield was substantially lower for instance in the absence of ala the h2o2 production efficiency was 49 2 10 2 g kwh 1 likely a part of h2o2 formed in the bulk liquid is decomposed on the activated carbon textile in agreement with reactions r 6 r 7 note that according to this reaction mechanism h2o2 is converted into ho and ho2 radicals which have a higher reactivity with organic pollutants and might thus be beneficial to achieve a faster pollutant decomposition 3 2 2 electron paramagnetic resonance measurements for assessing oxygen derived reactive species the presence of oxygen derived reactive species such as ozone o3 atomic oxygen o and singlet oxygen 1o2 was assessed in the liquid using electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy with a spin trap 4 oxo 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidine 4 oxo temp upon the oxidation of the amine group by these species a stable nitroxide radical 4 oxo 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidine n oxyl 4 oxo tempo is formed as illustrated in fig 4 elg et al 2017 privat maldonado et al 2018 takamatsu et al 2014 and its concentration is measured using epr as described in section 2 5 and text s2 it is worth mentioning that other potentially present species such as hydroxyl and superoxide radicals as well as hydrogen peroxide were shown to not oxidise piperidines in plasma liquid systems gorbanev et al 2016a b it also must be noted that spin trapping does not provide quantitative information about the total concentration of a reactive species present in the liquid privat maldonado et al 2018 rezaei et al 2018 however the changes in the concentration of the formed 4 oxo tempo directly correlate with the changes in the concentrations of the initially available free ros elg et al 2017 gorbanev et al 2016a b the presence of various ros was first analysed for the single pass experiments 5 mm solutions of 4 oxo temp in water with and without ala were passed through the plasma chamber once in this case the concentration of 4 oxo tempo correlates to the sum of concentration of initially available oxidising species o 1o2 o3 in the liquid after plasma exposure condition 1 to elaborate on the individual contributions of ros to the oxidation of 4 oxo temp two additional sets of experiments were carried out first the experiments were repeated with solutions containing 50 mm of added sodium azide a quencher of 1o2 at neutral ph elg et al 2017 gorbanev et al 2016a b takamatsu et al 2014 condition 2 second solutions containing only ala were treated and 5 mm 4 oxo temp was added to the aqueous solution immediately after the sample collection with a maximal time delay of about 5 s condition 3 taking into account the short lifetime of oxygen species such as 1o2 and o in aqueous solutions the formation of 4 oxo tempo in these experiments can be assigned to the presence of o3 in the treated solutions the results for both solutions with and without ala are shown in fig 5 the formation of 4 oxo tempo up to a concentration of ca 35 μm clearly established the presence of ros in the plasma treated solution to explore the potential difference in the concentration of 4 oxo tempo detected in the solution a student s t test was conducted within the accuracy of the measurements the concentration of 4 oxo tempo under all three conditions was found to be similar in the presence and absence of ala p 0 05 in other words the presence of ala does not dramatically affect the concentration of the formed 4 oxo tempo and therefore the concentration of available ros this is likely due to the large difference three orders of magnitude in the initial concentrations of ala and 4 oxo temp the addition of nan3 to the initial solution condition 2 strongly reduced the concentration of 4 oxo tempo it was shown that nan3 does not affect the concentration of the formed nitroxide in the plasma liquid systems when o3 and o without 1o2 are both present in the liquid elg et al 2017 gorbanev et al 2016a b therefore the reduced formation of 4 oxo tempo when nan3 was added to the solution is attributed to the scavenging of 1o2 this means that 1o2 is created in the gas phase plasma and further diffused into the liquid where it contributes to the degradation of ala a substantially lower but still detectable amount of 4 oxo tempo was also formed when 4 oxo temp was added to the aqueous solutions collected from the reactor outlet considering the short lifetime of o and 1o2 in aqueous solutions the formation of 4 oxo tempo in this experiment shows the presence of residual o3 in the liquid this proves that o3 is present in the treated water even during the single pass configuration e g without using additional ozonation further experiments were performed in batch mode in which the liquid was continuously recirculated between the solution reservoir and the plasma chamber see fig 1 above in these experiments 500 ml of the solution was continuously passed through the plasma reactor at a flow rate of 56 3 ml min 1 and samples were taken directly from the solution reservoir the concentration of 4 oxo tempo was measured in the analysed samples for the same experimental conditions as used in the single pass experiments and is shown in fig 6 under conditions 1 and 2 the concentration of the formed 4 oxo tempo increased near linearly within the experimental timeframe fig 6 additionally an increase in the amount of the residual o3 condition 3 was noticed as presented in fig s4 in the supplementary material no significant difference was observed between the solution with and without ala consistently with the results obtained in the single pass experiments fig 5 furthermore in fig 6 the low concentration of the formed 4 oxo tempo after 2 5 and 5 min can in part be explained by the dilution of the solution that passed through the reactor with the rest of the solution in the reservoir alternatively the lower concentration of 4 oxo tempo detected in batch mode can also be attributed to enhanced degradation of the formed nitroxide n o radical moiety in the 4 oxo tempo molecule at prolonged plasma exposure times the nitroxide group is prone to decay caused by e g ho radicals in plasma liquid systems gorbanev et al 2016b at longer exposure times h2o2 was accumulating in the liquid solution as presented earlier in fig 3 at high concentrations h2o2 can react with atomic o elg et al 2017 hefny et al 2016 verlackt et al 2017 or o3 merenyi et al 2010 generating large amount of additional ho radicals in the liquid 3 3 oxidation products as mentioned above several oxidising species might be generated during plasma treatment and therefore potentially be involved in the decomposition of alachlor it has been reported that the hydroxyl radical ho preferentially reacts with organic compounds through three major reaction pathways being i the abstraction of a hydrogen atom ii the electrophilic addition of a ho radical to multiple bonds and iii electron transfer reactions to the best of our knowledge no information is available in the literature concerning the reaction mechanisms of organic compounds with other oxidants i e o or 1o2 therefore it is not possible to assign the detection of a certain by product to the presence of a specific oxidant in solution for the reactor operated in batch recirculation mode the oxidation by product analysis has already been reported in our previous work vanraes et al 2018 for oxygen plasma four types of oxidation steps were observed hydroxylation addition of a double bonded oxygen dealkylation dechlorination as shown in table s3 in the supplementary material most of the by products that were identified in the previous study when plasma was ignited in either o2 or air vanraes et al 2018 are also found in the present study for treatment with o2 plasma in the single pass flow through setup the exception was dechlorinated ala 2d demethylated ala with and without the addition of a double bonded oxygen 3 b and 3u and four compounds formed through one or more hydroxylation and or oxygen addition steps 3i 3r 3s and 3z a proposed reaction pathway in the plasma reactor is given in fig 7 as expected the four oxidation steps are observed in the single pass configuration in most identified by products comparison of the ion abundances in the hplc tof ms analysis indicates a majority of hydroxylated by products such as the five monohydroxylated isomers k see fig 8 compounds formed through the addition of double bonded oxygen make the next most abundant group including the r and e isomers with one and two added oxygen atoms respectively this stands in contrast with the results for treatment in the batch reactor configuration where by products with a double bonded oxygen dominated in the analysis results see fig 8 b especially one of the r isomers i e r was found in a remarkably high abundance it should be noted that the mentioned abundance values are only indicative for the corresponding by product concentration although the hplc tof ms method is expected to have a similar sensitivity to compounds with a similar chemical structure a calibration for each of the products would be required to obtain exact concentrations therefore the abundance values can be used to get an idea of the order of magnitude of the concentration but should not be understood as exact concentration values second the abundance of any compound in fig 8 for the batch reactor configuration corresponds to the sample with its highest abundance i e taken after at least 2 5 min of treatment in contrast the hrt of the solution in the plasma reactor is about 2 s this retention time applies to the plasma reactor in the batch configuration as well keeping this in mind the high abundance of r in the batch reactor relative to the single pass configuration cannot be explained solely with the processes in the plasma reactor and is probably mainly due to the chemistry in the ozonation chamber r has indeed been reported as the main ala oxidation by product for ozonation and the peroxone process qiang et al 2010 which are expected to be the main oxidation processes in the solution reservoir this seems to imply that the addition of a double bonded oxygen is generally a more common mechanism than hydroxylation during ala oxidation in ozonation or the peroxone process which can explain the observed difference in their prevalence between the single pass and batch experiments next to hydroxylation and addition of a double bonded oxygen dechlorination and dealkylation of the ala side chains is observed in all studied conditions albeit to a lower degree fig 8 remarkably a few by products are measured in the single pass reactor configuration that cannot be explained solely with these four types of oxidation steps the by products i and t for instance require an additional step with hydrogen subtraction and likely the formation of a double or triple bond between two carbons further as seen in table s3 the mass spectrum of by product x displays the same dissociation pattern as ala in this pattern the first daughter ion is formed with the release of a ch3oh fragment which sequentially results in the second daughter ion by the elimination of a c2hclo fragment since both fragments originate from the n substituted branch this branch is identical for both molecules therefore the oxidation mechanisms that led to by product x took place at the other part of the molecule this however implies that the chemical formula of x cannot be explained with an aromatic ring as it has a lower degree of unsaturation in other words the aromatic structure has been lost in x and perhaps ring cleavage has taken place this is a very important finding since the loss of aromaticity although expected to occur qiang et al 2010 is not frequently observed in advanced oxidation processes noteworthy some of the other by products in fig 8 also may have lost their aromatic structure for instance if the combination of ring breaking and the addition of a double bonded oxygen has instead been identified as a hydroxylation step the hplc tof ms measurements can often not distinguish between both types of isomers 3 4 influence of additional ozonation in the plasma discharge ozone is formed from a three body reaction involving atomic oxygen o and molecular oxygen o2 r 11 r 11 o o 2 m o 3 m additional plasma gas bubbling into the solution reservoir appeared to be beneficial for the removal efficiency and energy consumption as shown above in fig 2 to assess the contribution of o3 to the degradation of ala the amount of gaseous o3 generated at the outlet of the plasma reactor and the solution reservoir was measured the concentration of o3 detected at the exhaust of the solution reservoir was found to be lower 7738 8 mg m ³ as compared to the amount of o3 produced at the outlet of the plasma reactor 8789 26 mg m ³ at steady state conditions the total o3 consumption in the ozonation chamber was determined by subtracting the amount of ozone measured at the exhaust of the ozonation chamber from the gaseous ozone concentration detected at the outlet of the plasma chamber this confirmed that in the plasma ozonation setup about 1051 mg m ³ o3 was dosed in the solution reservoir where it reacted with the pesticide and its by products or other oxidative species present in the liquid generating additional radicals such as e g a reaction between h2o2 and o3 merenyi et al 2010 wang et al 2018 the production of hydroxyl radicals during the decomposition of o3 is particularly advantageous due to their extremely high nearly diffusion controlled reaction rate constants with most organic pollutants wols and hofman caris 2012 4 conclusion in this work the removal of a chlorinated pesticide ala from deionized water was studied in a pulsed dbd plasma reactor combining plasma treatment with adsorption and additional ozonation the contribution of each distinct removal process was evaluated and a comparison in reactor performance between a single pass and batch recirculation configuration was made in both configurations the lowest removal efficiency was observed when ala removal was attempted with activated carbon adsorption alone in the single pass experiments about 39 was removed after one pass through the reactor and more than 80 of ala was adsorbed after 30 min of treatment in batch recirculation mode with regard to the energy efficiency of ala removal during plasma treatment in combination with activated carbon adsorption a slightly better energy cost is obtained in the single pass configuration ee osingle pass 19 4 kwh m 3 than in batch recirculation mode ee obatch 23 4 kwh m 3 to evaluate the role of aqueous oxidants on the decomposition of ala the production of various active species h2o2 o3 1o2 o was monitored by uv vis spectrophotometry and epr spectroscopy from epr analysis the presence of o 1o2 and o3 was identified in the plasma treated solution and could thus contribute to the decomposition of alachlor interestingly the h2o2 concentration formed in the reactor 220 μm was slightly smaller than the amount of h2o2 usually detected i e up to a few mm during plasma treatment in a dbd this could be attributed to the decomposition of h2o2 on the catalyst surface future experimental and computational micro kinetic studies could provide more details of the exact mechanism the reaction intermediates of ala in the single pass configuration are mainly formed through six major mechanisms including various hydroxylation dealkylation and dechlorination reactions as well as the loss of aromaticity finally the abundant production of o3 in the plasma suggested that the process could be enhanced by bubbling the plasma exhaust gas into the solution reservoir the energy cost was almost two times lower with the plasma exhaust gas bubbling through the solution ee o 10 4 kwh m 3 when compared with plasma treatment alone ee o 23 4 kwh m 3 at 90 ala removal declaration of interests the

18713,pesticides are emerging contaminants frequently detected in the aquatic environment in this work a novel approach combining activated carbon adsorption oxygen plasma treatment and ozonation was studied for the removal of the persistent chlorinated pesticide alachlor a comparison was made between the removal efficiency and energy consumption for two different reactor operation modes batch recirculation and single pass mode the kinetics study revealed that the insufficient removal of alachlor by adsorption was significantly improved in terms of degradation efficiency and energy consumption when combined with the plasma treatment the best efficiency ca 80 removal with an energy cost of 19 4 kwh m ³ was found for the single pass operational mode of the reactor in the batch recirculating process a complete elimination of alachlor by plasma treatment was observed after 30 min of treatment analysis of the reactive species induced by plasma in aqueous solutions showed that the decomposition of alachlor mainly occurred through a radical oxidation mechanism with a minor contribution of long living oxidants o3 h2o2 investigation of the alachlor oxidation pathways revealed six different oxidation mechanisms including the loss of aromaticity which was never before reported for plasma assisted degradation of aromatic pesticides it was revealed that the removal rate and energy cost could be further improved with more than 50 by additional o3 gas bubbling in the solution reservoir keywords non thermal plasma pesticides alachlor oxidative species by products 1 introduction the strong global population growth combined with raising living standards in the last century has forced industries to the large scale production of pharmaceuticals organic pesticides plasticizers and other synthetic materials since 1970 these anthropogenic substances have been increasingly detected in the aquatic environment eggen et al 2014 among the different types of organic contaminants encountered in the environment pesticides occupy a unique position since they are mostly deliberately distributed pesticides are chemical compounds that have been mainly designed to protect crops against fungal or animal pests indeed their presence in the environment has been primary traced back to agricultural applications they are divided in several groups such as carbamates pyrethroids neonicotinoids organochlorine organophosphate and biopesticides marican durán lara 2018 for their transfer to water bodies several potential pathways need to be considered köck schulmeyer et al 2013 monitoring data have shown that pesticides are usually released into the environment by diffusive sources one of them includes the release into the surface water through surface runoff from agricultural fields after rainfall events next to that part of the pesticide load can be mobilized through the soil eventually ending up in the ground water secondary effluent originating from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants is considered to be the major point source of pesticides entering into the surface water luo et al 2014 given the high toxicity of most pesticides along with their persistency towards conventional biological water treatment activated carbon adsorption and chemical oxidation are currently considered as key technologies for the remediation of pesticide containing wastewaters ikehata el din 2005 luo et al 2014 although ozonation has proved to be effective in the removal of many organic pollutants it was shown that the vast majority of the pesticides cannot be fully removed with ozonation alone ikehata el din 2005 it should be stressed that in deionized water the highly selective nature of o3 only allows for a fast reaction with a limited set of organic compounds many important classes of crop protection chemicals such as the organochlorine pesticides contain multiple hetero atoms e g n p cl in their molecular structure and are thus stabilized against direct o3 attack in the case of organochlorine pesticides the values for the second order rate constants with o3 are usually below 20 m 1 s 1 von gunten 2003 wols and hofman caris 2012 furthermore the combination of multiple oxidants generally leads to a faster decomposition of target pollutants as compared to ozonation oturan and aaron 2014 a promising alternative for the abatement of recalcitrant pesticides involves the application of non thermal plasmas electrical discharges sustained at atmospheric pressure and near ambient temperature plasmas created in liquids or gas liquid environments produce various oxidising reactive species ho ho2 o o3 h2o2 which contribute to the removal of organic compounds from water bradu et al 2017 jiang et al 2014 tarabová et al 2018 in plasma reactors where the discharge is initiated in the gas phase such as the dielectric barrier discharge dbd reactor mass transfer is limited by the contact time of the solution under treatment in the plasma zone therefore the removal efficiency and implicitly its energy consumption is kinetically controlled by the diffusion rate of plasma generated oxidants in the liquid film magureanu et al 2016 better removal efficiencies and higher energy yields are usually achieved in reactor systems that combine plasma treatment with catalysts such as activated carbon qu et al 2009 in particular the improved performance of these so called plasma catalytic reactors is attributed to i the increased the residence time of the target compound and dissolved chemical components i e h2o2 and o3 on the catalyst surface compared to the bulk liquid phase due to adsorption and ii the generation of reactive oxygen species ros which facilitates pollutant oxidation previously we have reported the use of plasma assisted removal of alachlor in a dbd reactor combining plasma treatment with activated carbon adsorption vanraes et al 2018 in the present work the removal and energy efficiency of i adsorption ii adsorption coupled with plasma treatment and iii adsorption with plasma treatment and additional ozonation with plasma gas produced in the discharge are compared alachlor ala a chlorinated herbicide belonging to the chloroacetanilide family was chosen as the target pesticide although banned within the european union it is still largely detected in some parts of the world badriyha et al 2003 in addition ala is well studied in terms of removal by different advanced oxidation processes making it a fitting model compound because the remediation of pesticide containing wastewaters can either be carried out in reactors operated in a batch or single pass flow through configuration the performance of both reactor modes was compared in this study in terms of removal efficiency and energy costs the production of various chemical oxidants plasma induced reactive species was studied to obtain a better understanding of the underpinning mechanisms that contribute to ala elimination finally oxidation by products formed during the oxidation of the pesticide were identified and the degradation pathways were suggested 2 materials methods 2 1 chemicals

titanium iv oxysulfate tioso4 98 were obtained from sigma aldrich belgium sodium azide nan3 99 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 v v and dichloromethane ch2cl2 99 were purchased from carl roth belgium all chemicals and solvents were used as received 2 2 solution preparation a saturated ala solution was prepared by dissolving 50 mg of ala powder in 100 ml of deionized water the solution was stirred for 3 h filtrated and finally diluted with deionized water to obtain a working solution with 1 mg l 1 ala solution which was used in the experiments it should be noted that the ala concentration of 1 mg l 1 used in this work is higher than expected for real contaminated water conditions higher initial pollutant concentration usually results in the competition of the target compound with the by products and the wastewater constituents i e dissolved organic compounds for the reaction with the oxidative species as explained in wardenier et al 2019 therefore for real wastewater treatment the application efficiency of the process studied here may be higher than the energy costs reported in section 3 2 3 experimental setup both the batch recirculation and single pass experiments were carried out in the plasma ozonation reactor fig 1 the detailed setup description is found elsewhere vanraes et al 2018 wardenier et al 2019 the reactor system consisted of a solution reservoir connected in series with a dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma reactor with cylindrical geometry the plasma reactor consisted of a stainless steel tube covered by one layer of zorflex activated carbon textile with 0 5 mm thickness and was mounted in the centre of a quartz glass vessel a copper mesh wrapped around the quartz vessel served as high voltage hv electrode dry oxygen was supplied at the bottom of the plasma chamber which served as plasma feed gas in all experiments the gas flow rate was fixed at 1 standard liter per minute slm using a bronckhorst mass flow controller giving a gas residence time of 1 98 s in the discharge zone the length of the discharge region was 150 mm with a discharge gap of 2 25 mm and discharge volume of 33 1 cm³ the high voltage electrode was connected to an alternating current ac power supply generating sinusoidal voltage at a frequency of 50 khz and a peak to peak voltage of 8000 v in order to improve the discharge stability the power supply was triggered by a pulse generator thurbly instruments which modulated the sinusoidal voltage waveform with a square wave function the modulated waveform was characterized by a plasma on time of 4 5 ms and a period ton toff of 25 5 ms corresponding to a duty cycle of dc ton ton toff 0 15 the applied voltage was measured using a tektronix p6015 high voltage probe while the total current was recorded by an ionphysics current probe voltage and current waveforms were sampled by a tektronix td 1002 digital oscilloscope the total input power p dissipated into the plasma could then be determined by multiplying the duty cycle with the power generated during one period of voltage p0 as shown in eq 1 1 p p 0 dc 2 4 reactor configurations experiments were conducted in the batch configuration to study the effect of i adsorption ii adsorption combined with plasma treatment and iii plasma ozonation on the removal of ala prior to treatment the solution reservoir was filled with 500 ml of a 1 mg l 1 ala solution the solution was continuously recirculated between the plasma chamber and the solution reservoir at a flow rate of 56 3 ml min 1 corresponding to a residence time of 8 9 min and 2 09 s in the solution reservoir and the plasma chamber respectively kovacevic et al 2017 details about the calculation method are given in text s1 in the supplementary material aliquots of 20 ml were sampled from the reservoir at different time points 0 2 5 5 10 15 20 25 30 min and subjected to various analyses see section 2 5 and text s2 in the supplementary material taking samples during the batch experiments reduces the total solution volume under treatment the error induced this way on the calculated reaction rate and eeo was determined to be less than 5 the plasma gas produced at the exhaust of the plasma chamber was either vented or bubbled through the solution reservoir via a porous ceramic ozone dispenser during plasma ozonation experiments the removal of ala by adsorption on the activated carbon textile was studied by recirculating the solution between both reactor chambers with the plasma switched off single pass experiments were conducted in the same experimental set up and under similar operational settings as used for the batch recirculating experiments to allow the solution under treatment to pass through the plasma reactor only once the reservoir was disconnected from the set up and the solution was continuously fed from the influent reservoir into the plasma chamber ala removal by adsorption on zorflex was measured after 10 s of operation subsequently the plasma was switched on and samples were taken from the reactor outlet at identical time steps as in the batch experiments to evaluate the performance of the reactor system the removal efficiency and energy consumption of each distinct process was determined the removal efficiency r is defined as the ratio between the amount of ala degraded in the reactor and the initial pollutant concentration eq 2 2 r c 0 c t c 0 100 c0 is the initial ala concentration and ct the concentration detected in solution after a given treatment time energy consumption calculated for 90 removal is determined by the

analysis was performed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array uv detector and time of flight mass spectrometry hplc tof ms see supplementary material for a complete description of the analytical procedures gaseous o3 in the exhaust gas stream generated at the outlet of the plasma reactor and the solution reservoir was continuously monitored by a specially developed on line ozone monitor text s2 section 2 1 in supplementary material in the liquid phase epr measurements were carried out in order to detect the presence of o 1o2 and o3 gorbanev et al 2016a b gorbanev et al 2018 for the quantification of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the titaniumoxysulphate method was used tarabová et al 2018 further details are provided in text s2 section 2 2 and fig s2 in the supplementary material 3 results discussion 3 1 alachlor removal kinetics table 1 summarizes the ala removal efficiency and energy consumption observed after adsorption and adsorption combined with plasma treatment in the single pass configuration the percentage of removal and ee osingle pass values found at different time intervals after plasma ignition along with a typical concentration profile is shown in table s1 and fig s3 in the supplementary material in the single pass experiment 39 removal was observed by adsorption alone as shown in table 1 and fig s3 although adsorption aided in the removal of ala it must be noted that the target compound decomposition did not occur ala was only transferred from the solution to the activated carbon surface at longer exposure times continuous adsorption of ala on the activated carbon membrane would result in a decreased adsorption capacity ultimately requiring a replacement of the carbon textile effective decomposition of ala can only occur when activated carbon adsorption is combined with an advanced oxidation process such as plasma treatment once the plasma was initiated the ala removal efficiency was increased reaching ca 80 under steady state conditions corresponding to an energy cost of 19 4 1 5 kwh m ³ for an initial ala concentration of 1 mg l 1 the increase in removal efficiency during the first 10 min of operation illustrates that the residence time of the ala molecules in the discharge zone is much higher i e several minutes than the hydraulic residence time hrt of the solution calculated from the assumption of a smooth laminar flow 2 09 s kovacevic et al 2017 according to the literature steady state concentrations are usually achieved within 3 5 times the hydraulic residence time hrt gerrity et al 2010 ajo et al 2016 following this line of thought the ala residence time in the plasma reactor is estimated to be in the range 2 3 min probably the difference in residence time between the solution and the ala molecules in the discharge zone is due to the continuous process of adsorption and desorption of ala on the carbon surface when passing through the reactor this in turn enhances the probability of interactions between the plasma generated oxidants and the alachlor molecules adsorbed on the activated carbon textile the removal of ala by adsorption plasma treatment and plasma ozonation during treatment in the batch recirculating configuration is shown in fig 2 similarly to the single pass configuration lowest removal efficiency was found for ala adsorption on zorflex accounting for 88 2 removal after 30 min of treatment a faster elimination of ala was found during plasma treatment and plasma ozonation where complete elimination was observed after 30 and 15 min of operation respectively when present in low concentrations 100 mg l 1 the elimination of organic compounds from water with advanced oxidation processes aops or plasma treatment obeys a pseudo first order kinetics bolton and tumas 1996 hence the rate law describing pollutant decomposition reads as eq 5 5 dc dt k c with c the pollutant concentration mol l t treatment time s and k the pseudo first order rate constant s 1 the solution of eq 5 c c 0 e k t suggests an exponential decay in alachlor concentration as a function of treatment time which is consistent with the shape of the alachlor decomposition profile shown in fig 2 the pseudo first order rate constant was obtained by fitting experimental data shown in fig 2 to eq 5 by means of nonlinear least squares regression following the levenberg marquardt algorithm to check the assumption of alachlor decomposition described by a pseudo first order kinetics table s2 in the supplementary material compares the computed rate constants and correlation coefficients r2 obtained from the fitting of the data with a zeroth order pseudo first order and second order kinetic model a satisfactory agreement was found between the experimental data and the model predictions obtained from the pseudo first order kinetic model r2 0 998 for the three fittings whereas the r2 values were smaller for the zeroth second order kinetic models r2 0 94 this justifies the use of a pseudo first order kinetic model for the accurate prediction of the alachlor decomposition the rate constant k 0 299 0 0102 min 1 obtained in the plasma ozonation setup is more than twice as high compared to the value found during plasma treatment alone k 0 134 0 0055 min 1 based on the kinetic data presented in fig 2 the energy consumption is found to be 23 4 kwh m ³ and 10 4 kwh m ³ for the elimination of ala by plasma and plasma ozonation respectively thus it is evident that the bubbling of the excess plasma gas mainly containing ozone throughout the solution reservoir is beneficial to achieve a better removal efficiency and a lower energy consumption 3 2 production of reactive species by plasma plasma assisted decomposition of organic compounds is typically a complex process that involves the participation of multiple oxidising reagents such as reactive oxygen species ros in a gas phase plasma sustained in a humid o2 atmosphere collisions between the electrons and the gas molecules o2 h2o initiate the production of oxidising species including various radicals ho ho2 o h excited species 1o2 neutral molecules o3 h2o2 h2 and charged ions o o2 o4 ho h h ho o o2 o4 through a series of chemical reactions bradu et al 2017 jiang et al 2014 reactive species generated in the gas phase then diffuse in the liquid where they initiate secondary reactions for reactor systems that combine plasma treatment with activated carbon adsorption organic pollutant elimination can take place simultaneously in the plasma liquid interface the bulk liquid and on the catalyst surface a plausible pathway describing the decomposition of organic compounds was put forward by jiang et al 2014 and is summarized in reactions r1 r8 first micropollutants present in the bulk liquid phase diffuse from the bulk liquid to the activated carbon surface where a fraction of the initial ala concentration is adsorbed r 1 the adsorption efficiency depends on the nature of the target compound as described in vanraes et al 2018 from the results obtained from single pass experiment summarized in table 1 it could be deduced that about 49 is removed from the solution by adsorption on the zorflex textile after one pass through the reactor hereby the accumulation of ala at the active carbon textile results in a local micropollutant concentration in the region near the plasma liquid interface resulting in a higher probability for interactions with the plasma generated oxidants present in the liquid phase furthermore it is important to stress that activated carbon itself also catalyses the decomposition of long living oxidants o3 h2o2 present in the bulk liquid through a series of reactions r 2 r 7 generating highly reactive radicals in solution and attached to the adsorption material which can contribute to the elimination of ala this leads to the self regeneration of activated carbon and thus prolongs the lifetime of the activated carbon textile indeed several works have suggested the use of plasma technology for the regeneration of activated carbon gushchin et al 2018 jiang et al 2014 qu et al 2009 tang et al 2018 r 1 ac m ac m r 2 o 3 h ac h ac o

the elimination of ala the contribution of various chemical oxidants to ala removal was studied in the following sections 3 2 1 hydrogen peroxide in batch mode fig 3 illustrates the formation of h2o2 in the liquid phase for the batch recirculating configuration a linear increase of h2o2 concentration was observed in deionized water reaching a concentration of ca 220 μm while a higher amount 272 μm of h2o2 was formed in the presence of ala after 30 min of treatment a similar finding i e a higher concentration of h2o2 in the presence of an organic compound dissolved in deionized water was previously reported in a pulsed corona discharge magureanu et al 2016 it is well documented that hydrogen peroxide is mainly formed from radical radical recombination reactions in the plasma treated liquid r 9 10 following this consideration the detection of h2o2 in solution indirectly confirmed the presence of radical species ho ho2 as an additional source in gas phase discharge part of the h2o2 found in the liquid might be attributed to the direct transfer of h2o2 from the gas phase plasma to the liquid due to its high henry s constant hcc 1 92 106 lietz and kushner 2016 heirman et al 2019 r 9 ho ho h 2 o 2 r 10 ho 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 franclemont et al 2015 reported h2o2 concentrations up to 800 μm in a pulsed corona discharge directly in the liquid while sarangapani et al 2017 observed a smaller amount of h2o2 490 μm in a dbd reactor fed with air further kovacevic et al 2017 showed that the production of h2o2 in a liquid film reactor depends on the nature of the feed gas the authors observed the largest h2o2 concentration in pure ar 588 μm on the contrary a slightly smaller concentration of h2o2 could be detected during air plasma treatment 441 μm the latter is explained by the consumption of h2o2 due to the reaction with nitrite no2 which takes place in an acidic environment the efficiency of h2o2 generation in plasma reactor is often expressed by the h2o2 energy yield g kwh 1 in the review of locke and shih 2011 h2o2 energy yields were summarized for a variety of plasma reactors h2o2 energy yields up to 80 g kwh 1 were reported for reactor configurations where the plasma was generated in the liquid while in most dbd reactors energy yield was calculated to be around 2 70 g kwh 1 in this study the h2o2 yield was substantially lower for instance in the absence of ala the h2o2 production efficiency was 49 2 10 2 g kwh 1 likely a part of h2o2 formed in the bulk liquid is decomposed on the activated carbon textile in agreement with reactions r 6 r 7 note that according to this reaction mechanism h2o2 is converted into ho and ho2 radicals which have a higher reactivity with organic pollutants and might thus be beneficial to achieve a faster pollutant decomposition 3 2 2 electron paramagnetic resonance measurements for assessing oxygen derived reactive species the presence of oxygen derived reactive species such as ozone o3 atomic oxygen o and singlet oxygen 1o2 was assessed in the liquid using electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy with a spin trap 4 oxo 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidine 4 oxo temp upon the oxidation of the amine group by these species a stable nitroxide radical 4 oxo 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidine n oxyl 4 oxo tempo is formed as illustrated in fig 4 elg et al 2017 privat maldonado et al 2018 takamatsu et al 2014 and its concentration is measured using epr as described in section 2 5 and text s2 it is worth mentioning that other potentially present species such as hydroxyl and superoxide radicals as well as hydrogen peroxide were shown to not oxidise piperidines in plasma liquid systems gorbanev et al 2016a b it also must be noted that spin trapping does not provide quantitative information about the total concentration of a reactive species present in the liquid privat maldonado et al 2018 rezaei et al 2018 however the changes in the concentration of the formed 4 oxo tempo directly correlate with the changes in the concentrations of the initially available free ros elg et al 2017 gorbanev et al 2016a b the presence of various ros was first analysed for the single pass experiments 5 mm solutions of 4 oxo temp in water with and without ala were passed through the plasma chamber once in this case the concentration of 4 oxo tempo correlates to the sum of concentration of initially available oxidising species o 1o2 o3 in the liquid after plasma exposure condition 1 to elaborate on the individual contributions of ros to the oxidation of 4 oxo temp two additional sets of experiments were carried out first the experiments were repeated with solutions containing 50 mm of added sodium azide a quencher of 1o2 at neutral ph elg et al 2017 gorbanev et al 2016a b takamatsu et al 2014 condition 2 second solutions containing only ala were treated and 5 mm 4 oxo temp was added to the aqueous solution immediately after the sample collection with a maximal time delay of about 5 s condition 3 taking into account the short lifetime of oxygen species such as 1o2 and o in aqueous solutions the formation of 4 oxo tempo in these experiments can be assigned to the presence of o3 in the treated solutions the results for both solutions with and without ala are shown in fig 5 the formation of 4 oxo tempo up to a concentration of ca 35 μm clearly established the presence of ros in the plasma treated solution to explore the potential difference in the concentration of 4 oxo tempo detected in the solution a student s t test was conducted within the accuracy of the measurements the concentration of 4 oxo tempo under all three conditions was found to be similar in the presence and absence of ala p 0 05 in other words the presence of ala does not dramatically affect the concentration of the formed 4 oxo tempo and therefore the concentration of available ros this is likely due to the large difference three orders of magnitude in the initial concentrations of ala and 4 oxo temp the addition of nan3 to the initial solution condition 2 strongly reduced the concentration of 4 oxo tempo it was shown that nan3 does not affect the concentration of the formed nitroxide in the plasma liquid systems when o3 and o without 1o2 are both present in the liquid elg et al 2017 gorbanev et al 2016a b therefore the reduced formation of 4 oxo tempo when nan3 was added to the solution is attributed to the scavenging of 1o2 this means that 1o2 is created in the gas phase plasma and further diffused into the liquid where it contributes to the degradation of ala a substantially lower but still detectable amount of 4 oxo tempo was also formed when 4 oxo temp was added to the aqueous solutions collected from the reactor outlet considering the short lifetime of o and 1o2 in aqueous solutions the formation of 4 oxo tempo in this experiment shows the presence of residual o3 in the liquid this proves that o3 is present in the treated water even during the single pass configuration e g without using additional ozonation further experiments were performed in batch mode in which the liquid was continuously recirculated between the solution reservoir and the plasma chamber see fig 1 above in these experiments 500 ml of the solution was continuously passed through the plasma reactor at a flow rate of 56 3 ml min 1 and samples were taken directly from the solution reservoir the concentration of 4 oxo tempo was measured in the analysed samples for the same experimental conditions as used in the single pass experiments and is shown in fig 6 under conditions 1 and 2 the concentration of the formed 4 oxo tempo increased near linearly within the experimental timeframe fig 6 additionally an increase in the amount of the residual o3 condition 3 was noticed as presented in fig s4 in the supplementary material no significant difference was observed between the solution with and without ala consistently with the results obtained in the single pass experiments fig 5 furthermore in fig 6 the low concentration of the formed 4 oxo tempo after 2 5 and 5 min can in part be explained by the dilution of the solution that passed through the reactor with the rest of the solution in the reservoir alternatively the lower concentration of 4 oxo tempo detected in batch mode can also be attributed to enhanced degradation of the formed nitroxide n o radical moiety in the 4 oxo tempo molecule at prolonged plasma exposure times the nitroxide group is prone to decay caused by e g ho radicals in plasma liquid systems gorbanev et al 2016b at longer exposure times h2o2 was accumulating in the liquid solution as presented earlier in fig 3 at high concentrations h2o2 can react with atomic o elg et al 2017 hefny et al 2016 verlackt et al 2017 or o3 merenyi et al 2010 generating large amount of additional ho radicals in the liquid 3 3 oxidation products as mentioned above several oxidising species might be generated during plasma treatment and therefore potentially be involved in the decomposition of alachlor it has been reported that the hydroxyl radical ho preferentially reacts with organic compounds through three major reaction pathways being i the abstraction of a hydrogen atom ii the electrophilic addition of a ho radical to multiple bonds and iii electron transfer reactions to the best of our knowledge no information is available in the literature concerning the reaction mechanisms of organic compounds with other oxidants i e o or 1o2 therefore it is not possible to assign the detection of a certain by product to the presence of a specific oxidant in solution for the reactor operated in batch recirculation mode the oxidation by product analysis has already been reported in our previous work vanraes et al 2018 for oxygen plasma four types of oxidation steps were observed hydroxylation addition of a double bonded oxygen dealkylation dechlorination as shown in table s3 in the supplementary material most of the by products that were identified in the previous study when plasma was ignited in either o2 or air vanraes et al 2018 are also found in the present study for treatment with o2 plasma in the single pass flow through setup the exception was dechlorinated ala 2d demethylated ala with and without the addition of a double bonded oxygen 3 b and 3u and four compounds formed through one or more hydroxylation and or oxygen addition steps 3i 3r 3s and 3z a proposed reaction pathway in the plasma reactor is given in fig 7 as expected the four oxidation steps are observed in the single pass configuration in most identified by products comparison of the ion abundances in the hplc tof ms analysis indicates a majority of hydroxylated by products such as the five monohydroxylated isomers k see fig 8 compounds formed through the addition of double bonded oxygen make the next most abundant group including the r and e isomers with one and two added oxygen atoms respectively this stands in contrast with the results for treatment in the batch reactor configuration where by products with a double bonded oxygen dominated in the analysis results see fig 8 b especially one of the r isomers i e r was found in a remarkably high abundance it should be noted that the mentioned abundance values are only indicative for the corresponding by product concentration although the hplc tof ms method is expected to have a similar sensitivity to compounds with a similar chemical structure a calibration for each of the products would be required to obtain exact concentrations therefore the abundance values can be used to get an idea of the order of magnitude of the concentration but should not be understood as exact concentration values second the abundance of any compound in fig 8 for the batch reactor configuration corresponds to the sample with its highest abundance i e taken after at least 2 5 min of treatment in contrast the hrt of the solution in the plasma reactor is about 2 s this retention time applies to the plasma reactor in the batch configuration as well keeping this in mind the high abundance of r in the batch reactor relative to the single pass configuration cannot be explained solely with the processes in the plasma reactor and is probably mainly due to the chemistry in the ozonation chamber r has indeed been reported as the main ala oxidation by product for ozonation and the peroxone process qiang et al 2010 which are expected to be the main oxidation processes in the solution reservoir this seems to imply that the addition of a double bonded oxygen is generally a more common mechanism than hydroxylation during ala oxidation in ozonation or the peroxone process which can explain the observed difference in their prevalence between the single pass and batch experiments next to hydroxylation and addition of a double bonded oxygen dechlorination and dealkylation of the ala side chains is observed in all studied conditions albeit to a lower degree fig 8 remarkably a few by products are measured in the single pass reactor configuration that cannot be explained solely with these four types of oxidation steps the by products i and t for instance require an additional step with hydrogen subtraction and likely the formation of a double or triple bond between two carbons further as seen in table s3 the mass spectrum of by product x displays the same dissociation pattern as ala in this pattern the first daughter ion is formed with the release of a ch3oh fragment which sequentially results in the second daughter ion by the elimination of a c2hclo fragment since both fragments originate from the n substituted branch this branch is identical for both molecules therefore the oxidation mechanisms that led to by product x took place at the other part of the molecule this however implies that the chemical formula of x cannot be explained with an aromatic ring as it has a lower degree of unsaturation in other words the aromatic structure has been lost in x and perhaps ring cleavage has taken place this is a very important finding since the loss of aromaticity although expected to occur qiang et al 2010 is not frequently observed in advanced oxidation processes noteworthy some of the other by products in fig 8 also may have lost their aromatic structure for instance if the combination of ring breaking and the addition of a double bonded oxygen has instead been identified as a hydroxylation step the hplc tof ms measurements can often not distinguish between both types of isomers 3 4 influence of additional ozonation in the plasma discharge ozone is formed from a three body reaction involving atomic oxygen o and molecular oxygen o2 r 11 r 11 o o 2 m o 3 m additional plasma gas bubbling into the solution reservoir appeared to be beneficial for the removal efficiency and energy consumption as shown above in fig 2 to assess the contribution of o3 to the degradation of ala the amount of gaseous o3 generated at the outlet of the plasma reactor and the solution reservoir was measured the concentration of o3 detected at the exhaust of the solution reservoir was found to be lower 7738 8 mg m ³ as compared to the amount of o3 produced at the outlet of the plasma reactor 8789 26 mg m ³ at steady state conditions the total o3 consumption in the ozonation chamber was determined by subtracting the amount of ozone measured at the exhaust of the ozonation chamber from the gaseous ozone concentration detected at the outlet of the plasma chamber this confirmed that in the plasma ozonation setup about 1051 mg m ³ o3 was dosed in the solution reservoir where it reacted with the pesticide and its by products or other oxidative species present in the liquid generating additional radicals such as e g a reaction between h2o2 and o3 merenyi et al 2010 wang et al 2018 the production of hydroxyl radicals during the decomposition of o3 is particularly advantageous due to their extremely high nearly diffusion controlled reaction rate constants with most organic pollutants wols and hofman caris 2012 4 conclusion in this work the removal of a chlorinated pesticide ala from deionized water was studied in a pulsed dbd plasma reactor combining plasma treatment with adsorption and additional ozonation the contribution of each distinct removal process was evaluated and a comparison in reactor performance between a single pass and batch recirculation configuration was made in both configurations the lowest removal efficiency was observed when ala removal was attempted with activated carbon adsorption alone in the single pass experiments about 39 was removed after one pass through the reactor and more than 80 of ala was adsorbed after 30 min of treatment in batch recirculation mode with regard to the energy efficiency of ala removal during plasma treatment in combination with activated carbon adsorption a slightly better energy cost is obtained in the single pass configuration ee osingle pass 19 4 kwh m 3 than in batch recirculation mode ee obatch 23 4 kwh m 3 to evaluate the role of aqueous oxidants on the decomposition of ala the production of various active species h2o2 o3 1o2 o was monitored by uv vis spectrophotometry and epr spectroscopy from epr analysis the presence of o 1o2 and o3 was identified in the plasma treated solution and could thus contribute to the decomposition of alachlor interestingly the h2o2 concentration formed in the reactor 220 μm was slightly smaller than the amount of h2o2 usually detected i e up to a few mm during plasma treatment in a dbd this could be attributed to the decomposition of h2o2 on the catalyst surface future experimental and computational micro kinetic studies could provide more details of the exact mechanism the reaction intermediates of ala in the single pass configuration are mainly formed through six major mechanisms including various hydroxylation dealkylation and dechlorination reactions as well as the loss of aromaticity finally the abundant production of o3 in the plasma suggested that the process could be enhanced by bubbling the plasma exhaust gas into the solution reservoir the energy cost was almost two times lower with the plasma exhaust gas bubbling through the solution ee o 10 4 kwh m 3 when compared with plasma treatment alone ee o 23 4 kwh m 3 at 90 ala removal declaration of interests the

18714,the role of rivers as a major transport pathway for all sizes of plastic debris into the ocean is widely recognized global modelling studies ranked the changjiang river as the largest contributor of plastic waste to the marine environment but these estimates were based on insufficient empirical data to better understand the role of rivers in delivering terrestrial plastic debris to the ocean the spatial and temporal patterns of microplastics mp in the changjiang estuary ce and the east china sea ecs were studied based on surface water samples in february may and july 2017 a total of 3225 mp 60 5000 μm were identified by fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometry mp abundance in july was higher than in february and may due to higher river discharge density stratification in ce significantly influenced the surface mp abundances a temporal accumulation zone within the river sea interface for plastics was indicated by stations with apparently higher abundances in the river plume fibers were the most common mp 80 over three months small mp 1000 μm composed 75 0 of the total plastics on average the average mass of mp was 0 000033 g particle which was two orders of magnitude lower than the empirical mass in literature without considering tidal effects we estimate 16 20 trillion mp particles weighing 537 6 905 9 tons entered the sea through the surface water layer of the changjiang river in 2017 these findings of this study provide reliable information on mp waste in a large river which should be considered in further studies for estimating the riverine plastic loads graphical abstract image 1 keywords plastic debris microplastic plastic loads river changjiang estuary east china sea 1 introduction plastic contamination has become one of the most pressing environmental issues geyer et al 2017 estimated that approximately 6300 million tons of plastic waste have been generated worldwide from 1950 to 2015 a fraction of which ultimately

however in the past decade the focus has shifted on the ubiquitous mp which are made up of small plastics derived from the fragmentation of macroplastics and are of microscopic size galloway and lewis 2017 rivers are considered as an important vector for the transport of different types of debris into the sea rech et al 2014 sadri and thompson 2014 a better understanding of the role of rivers in transporting plastics into the ocean is crucial for clarifying the sources pathways and mass balance of ocean plastics recently plastic debris loads of global rivers into the ocean were modeled based on global mismanged plastic waste annually 1 15 2 41 million tons of plastic waste currently enter the ocean from rivers worldwide with 74 of emissions occurring between may and october lebreton et al 2017 similarly schmidt et al 2017a b estimated that 0 41 4 0 million tons of land based plastic debris are transported by rivers into the ocean each year schmidt et al 2017a furthermore both the above studies noted that the top polluting rivers mostly located in asia accounted for 67 94 of the global plastic load based on their caculations the changjiang river was regarded as the largest contributor worldwide delivering 0 15 0 33 million tons of platic waste both macro and micro plastic per year into the adjacent east china sea ecs lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017a however estimates from both studies are uncertain due to the sparse and hetergeneous datasets data from different studies on riverine mp that were compiled and analyzed by the models vary significantly which is likely attributed to the sampling design collection devices analysis methods and report units for instance no more than three or four consecutive measurements were found in the dataset used by schmidt et al 2017a as one of the largest rivers in the world mp in the changjiang estuary ce is poorly studied zhao et al 2014 filtered water samples 12 20 l per sample through 32 μm sieves and reported that the mean suspended mp abundance in the ce yangtze estuary was 4137 n m3 zhao et al 2014 however this estimate was based on a sole sampling campaign in july and the lack of chemical identification of the suspected plastic particles in this study inevitably led to significant errors hidalgo ruz et al 2012 luo et al 2019 recently studied mp pollution in the ce and the ecs by filtering 5 l surface water through 20 μm nylon filters and reported the mean abundance of mp in the estuary and coastal water to be 900 n m3 luo et al 2019 by studing the microplastic at 15 sites along the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river changjiang river xiong et al 2019 obtained a range of mp abundance from 1 95 105 to 9 00 105 items km2 they also suggested that a considerable amount of mp from the large river cathments did not reach the sea in the present study a much larger number of surface water samples 100 l per sample were collected from the ce and est during three cruises in different seasons winter spring and summer the spatial and temporal features of floating mp 60 5000 μm abundance distribution and composition in the studied region were analyzed which could assist in identifying the spatial and seasonal patterns of plastic transport fluxes from the land to sea and support the implementation of cost effective monitoring and source mitigation efforts furthermore we compared the overall mp 300 5000 μm abundance in the ce with global estuaries and roughly estimated the plastic load passing through ce into the esc our results should improve the assessment of plastic load from rivers to the sea 2 materials and methods 2 1 1 sampling mp were collected during three research cruises 15 28 february 2017 5 23 may 2017 and 18 july 3 august 2017 onboard the r v run jiang no 1 in the ce and the ecs fig 1 detailed information of the studied region and sampling sites is provided in the supplementary data and the excel sheet water samples were collected using a screw pump which was deployed at around 30 cm depth on the front port side of the ship for each sample 100 l water was pumped into a high density polyethylene hdpe tank with a metal tap at the bottom all samples within the ce were taken during the ebb phase only the collected waters were filtered through a stainless steel sieve pore size 60 μm the retained materials on the sieve were flushed into clean 250 ml poly tetra fluoroethylene bottles with milli q water samples were stored at 5 c prior to analysis one sample 100 l waters was collected at each sampling site during the february cruise while three replicates 100 l 3 were sampled during the may and july cruises detailed information of the samples is listed in table s1 the profiles of temperature salinity and density at each station were measured with a conductivity temperature and depth ctd device sea bird electronics 25 bellevue wa usa 2 2 laboratory analyses in the lab samples were transferred into clean glass beakers and digested with 30 h2o2 solution at 60 c to eliminate organic matter this step was repeated if necessary until the solution was clear in appearance the contents were then filtered through 0 45 μm sartorius filters 47 mm diameter an individual filter was stored in a glass petri dish and examined under a stereo microscope leicam165 fc at magnification 160 based on summarized criteria from previous research nor and obbard 2014 zhao et al 2014 2016 a detailed protocol is provided in the supplementary data suspected particles were marked with red circles on the filter the particles were then photographed and measured for the largest dimension using the built in leica application suite x software particles within the range of 60 5000 μm were enumerated based on morphology the suspected particles were categorized into fiber film and fragments finally all particles were analyzed using micro fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy bruker lumos germany in attenuated total reflectance atr mode each scan was accumulated as the average of 32 scans in the spectral range of 600 4000 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 three replicate atr ftir spectra were acquired on different spots of each particle each spectrum was compared against a database from bruker to verify the polymer type matching spectra with a quality index 70 were accepted 2 3 contamination prevention utmost precautions were taken to prevent sample contamination throughout the entire research process prior to use the hdpe graduated tanks and steel sieves were thoroughly washed with milli q water and then double covered with tinfoil in the field prior to their first use at each sampling site all containers e g the hdpe tanks and ptfe bottles were rinsed with 60 μm filtered in situ seawater in the laboratory the measurements reported by zhao et al 2017 were employed all of the liquid reagents and media were filtered through 0 45 μm glass filters whatman gf f glassware such as beakers filtration system glass filters petri dishes tinfoil and pasteur pipettes is recommended for use as much as possible during the entire procedure and should be rinsed with milli q water and heated at 450 c for 8 h to combust any organic materials during the procedure the clean glassware should be covered with combusted tinfoil wherever and whenever possible steel tweezers were washed with milli q water and sterilized under a flame prior to use all sample handling was carried out under a clean laminar flow cabinet personal protective ware such as nitrile gloves and cotton lab coats were worn during the laboratory activities air was drawn through three clean filters 0 45 μm sartorius during the plastic separation in the lab to determine the potential airborne particle contamination a mixture of filtered 30 h2o2 solution and milli q water in three combusted glass tubes was run through the whole processing procedure as process blanks 2 4 mp load through the ce the yearly mp mass in the surface layer around 30 cm depth passing through the ce was estimated using the following equation l o a d c e i 1 4 c i m a s s m i c r o d i s c h a r g e i d i s c h a r g e r a t i o i 3 10 6 where l o a d c e tons year is the annual plastic flux input to the ocean a sum of plastic masses of the four seasons spring summer fall and winter the symbol i represents the four seasons c i is the mean mp concentration n m3 of each month in corresponding season based on the river discharge and rainfall the datasets sampling in february may and july represent the mp abundances in the winter spring and summer of the year three measured mp concentrations were designed as the concentration in the fall representing the low midpoint and high values table 1 m a s s m i c r o is the averaged mp mass per particle 0 000033 g the average mass of mp was generated by measuring three subsamples of randomly selected plastic items from the ce for each replicate 100 identified plastics composing of 80 fibrous and 20 non fibrous particles were selected under the stereo microscope leicam165 fc and put on small pieces of pre weighed filter disc to reduce tare weight as low as possible d i s c h a r g e i m3 month was taken as the monthly averaged discharge of each season in changjiang river which were obtained from yangtze river sediment bulletin the changjiang water conservancy committee 2017 d i s c h a r g e r a t i o i is the proportional discharge rate through the top 30 cm it is under the assumption the discharge rate is constant throughout all depths which we aware is an over simplification d i s c h a r g e r a t i o i was calculated from the depth around 30 cm divided by the average water depth of the sampling stations in three months miller et al 2017 the ratio is under the assumption that the discharge is constant throughout all depths all the parameters used to estimate plastic loads were shown in table 1 2 5 statistical analysis the kruskal wallis test was used to analyze multiple comparisons if the test indicated significant differences pairwise comparisons were performed using the wilcoxon test in all tests an alpha level of 0 05 was used data are reported as mean standard deviation sd surfer 11 golden software llc golden co usa was used to draw contour lines based on kriging interpolation the strength of stratification is indicated by the density difference δρ between the bottom and surface of each station 3 results and discussion 3 1 mp abundance no plastic particles were present in our process blanks but natural material based fibrous particles either cotton or rayon semi synthetics were found on the air sucked filters fig s1 which were not enumerated in results of this study plastics were found in 99 205 207 of all samples a total of 3225 mp 60 5000 μm were confirmed by atr ftir the overall mean mp concentrations in ce and ecs were 157 2 75 8 n m3 and 112 8 51 1 n m3 respectively mp abundance in the ce was over 25 times lower than that 4137 3 2461 5 n m3 measured by zhao et al 2014 although both studies used pumps to collect samples this disparity may be primarily attributed to the lack of validation of the chemical matrix of the plastic like particles using complementary methods e g spectroscopic and thermo chemical methods by zhao et al 2014 the plastic identification by zhao et al 2014 was exclusively based on visual inspection using light microscopy visual identification alone has been reported to result in a high misidentification rate ranging from 20 eriksen et al 2013 to 70 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 mp concentrations in the sediment samples from similar locations in europe showed ca 100 fold differences between the visual identification data and ftir data claessens et al 2011 liebezeit and dubaish 2012 furthermore the visual identification error rate increases with decreasing particle size löder et al 2015 all particles in this study were identified by atr ftir guaranteeing the accuracy of polymer identification additionally smaller sampling volumes 20 or 12 l per sample in 2014 could result in highly variable concentrations lusher et al 2014 tamminga et al 2018 recently luo et al 2019 reported the average mp abundance in both the ce and est to be 900 n m3 which is higher than our results in the ce 157 2 n m3 and ecs 112 8 n m3 the 20 μm filters employed by luo et al 2019 in comparison to 60 μm in our study might primarily contribute to this difference the temporality of plastic pollution levels also contributed to this difference seasonal conditions play a significant role in the transportation of litter by rivers to the sea and lead to several orders of magnitude variation between plastic abundances at different periods lebreton et al 2017 van der wal et al 2015 vianelloa et al 2015 the concentration of the ce in this study was averaged from the data in february may and july 2017 spanning the lower to higher discharge rates of the changjiang river however the concentration in the ce in zhao et al 2014 was based only on a single sampling in july which might be largely biased in comparison to the abundance of mp in the ce in this study this emphasizes that long term systematic monitoring research for plastic litter items in the riverine environment is necessary to obtain more realistic and representative abundances of plastic debris in the future the average concentration in the ecs 112 8 51 1 n m3 was three orders of magnitude larger than a previous study 0 167 0 138 n m3 identified using 333 μm manta net samples zhao et al 2014 similarly mp abundances in the ecs were several orders of magnitude greater than other studies that used net trawls with various mesh sizes as the sampling device table s2 the bulk water sampling methods utilized in current studies have mainly contributed to this large disparity to determine the influence of variable sampling techniques net based and bulk sampling approaches have been compared in several studies in the south china sea the mp concentration 0 045 0 093 n m3 of the 333 μm bongo net samples was four orders of magnitude lower than that of pumping waters samples 2569 1770 n m3 at a depth of 0 5 m cai et al 2018 di mauro et al 2017 also found that mp concentrations 20 000 6000 particles m3 in niskin samples collected at approximately 1 m 5 m and 10 m from the sea surface were several orders of magnitude greater than either bongo 4 6 0 8 n m3 or neuston nets 8 6 2 0 n m3 at sampling sites in the northern gulf of mexico the contamination level determined by manta trawling was 0 07 0 02 n m3 in contrast to that of 1030 800 n m3 by bulk sampling from three depths 0 5 m 2 0 m and 5 0 m in the south funen archipelago baltic sea tamminga et al 2018 two factors likely explained the order of magnitude disparity in mp concentrations between the bulk water and the net based samples first the detection limitation of the plastic by net sampling is dependent on the mesh size selected as expected a smaller mesh size can retain considerably more plastics than a larger mesh size song et al found that mp abundance in 50 μm hand net samples 1443 3353 particles m3 was significantly larger than in manta trawling samples 47 192 particles m3 song et al 2014 mp abundance in coastal swedish waters in 80 μm and 450 μm mesh samples varied by up to six orders of magnitude norén 2007 a typical manta trawl cannot sample mp particles smaller than 300 μm resulting in the omission of smaller sized fractions second smaller and larger particles can be either forced aside from the net opening or squeezed out through the mesh for example particles e g fibers with lower aspect ratios can easily pass through the net by aligning themselves with the flow direction setälä et al 2016 particle size spectrum theory in the marine environment predicts that abundance increases with decreasing particle size sheldon and parsons 1967 on average 29 4 of mp particles in our study were smaller than 0 3 mm fig 6abc table s3 this suggested that studies extrapolating neuston tow data to worldwide abundances cózar et al 2014 eriksen et al 2014 may similarly underestimate mp abundance in the sea 3 2 temporality of mp abundances mp abundances in the ce and ecs varied considerably across the three months fig 2 table s1 mp concentrations in the ce were apparently different among the different months as well as that in the ecs kruskal wallis test p ce 4 10 10 4 p ecs 1 19 10 5 the concentrations in july of the ce and ecs were apparently higher than those of the other months influenced by the east asian monsoon the studied area in july 2017 was characterized by the highest level of rainfall among the three sampling seasons resulting in an increased river flux into the estuary which likely explained the seasonality of mp abundance mismanaged waste generated in the river basin could migrate toward the estuarine portion following the river flow plastic litter retained in the adjacent areas around the estuary can be flushed into the waterways more frequently in the rainy season than the dry season eventually entering into the adjacent sea lima et al 2014 moore et al 2002 zhao et al 2015 this distinct seasonality in mp abundance emphasizes that temporal variations must be also considered when monitoring the levels of plastic pollution within a region that has high seasonal variations in rainfall an overestimation of 53 9 in the ce and 55 7 in the ecs would occur if the average abundance of mp in this study was calculated solely from the data obtained in july 3 3 patchy distribution of mp no differences were found between mp abundances in the ce and ecs of each month wilcoxon test february p 0 99 may 0 73 july 0 66 however the abundances fluctuated highly among the sampling sites within each month the average mp abundance of each site ranged from 20 0 to 290 n m3 in the ce and 10 0 to 647 6 n m3 in the ecs fig 3 a high spatial heterogeneity of mp abundance on a smaller scale has been shown previously goldstein et al 2013 unexpectedly the highest mp concentrated sites sites a2 5 a8 2 a8 4 in february a9 4 a10 3 a11 1 in may a4 6 d3 e4 in july fig 3 in this study were all located in the ecs and not in the internal estuary ce which is inconsistent with a previous study that reported higher mp abundances in the estuary than in the ecs zhao et al 2014 the patchiness in the floating mp distribution is probably related to the following factors 1 plastic particles display an increasing frequency distribution skewed toward smaller size classes in many studies cózar et al 2014 mp size at sites with higher abundance in the ecs were considerably smaller than those from estuarine sites fig 4 the fast flux of smaller sized mp within limited distances from the coast depending on the fast fragmentation of terrestrial plastic debris may contribute to this size disparity pedrotti et al 2016 2 plastics at the sea possess more variant origins due to the high dispersion mp at the sea may come from both the land and sea in the ecs the northward kuroshio branch current kbc and taiwan warm current twc were steady and may transport floating plastic litter to our study area the kuroshio current system has been thought to deliver plastic waste from asia to the great pacific garbage lebreton et al 2018 due to the instantaneous sampling in the current study other factors e g tidal currents wind eddies river flow vertical mixing and wave action may also contribute to the surges in mp abundance at some sampling sites resulting in temporal patches for floating mp schmidt et al 2017b van der hal et al 2017 3 4 characteristics of mp mp size in this study ranged from 60 to 4953 μm and displayed an asymmetrical frequency distribution skewed toward smaller size classes fig 5abc particles smaller than 300 μm accounted for 29 4 of the total number ranging from 21 8 to 30 6 in ce and ecs across the different months and regions fig 5abc and table s3 furthermore mp 1 mm a size specific loss of floating plastic in the open ocean cózar et al 2014 comprised 75 0 of the total number and varied from 68 2 to 86 3 the large fractions of smaller sized mp corroborated that of studies based on the commonly used net trawl sampling technique which might miss considerable plastic debris in the surface waters and contribute considerably to the missing plastic in the global ocean cózar et al 2014 the mean size of mp in the ce varied significantly over the three sampling months kruskal wallis test p 4 1 10 3 as well as that in the ecs kruskal wallis test p 1 3 10 11 the particle size in may was apparently smaller than the measurements in february and july wilcoxon test p 1 0 10 14 7 7 10 6 in the ecs p 0 01 0 01 in the ce fig 5 d though plastics are designed to be persistent physical factors e g wave action and wind and uv light enhance their fragmentation in the environment depending on the exposure time andrady 2011 however the short interval between samplings in this study may not have allowed the plastics to become sufficiently photo degraded this temporal pattern in mean size could be largely ascribed to heavy rainfall during the wet season at the beginning of the wet season may mp in the changjiang catchment which had become brittle and fragmented into smaller sized particles due to multiple factors e g uv wind exposure to air were probably flushed into the ce and the adjacent ecs a similar result was reported by gündoğdu et al 2018 who found that the average size of the floating mp in the mersin bay decreased from 2 37 mm in the pre flood period to 1 13 mm in the post flood period gündoğdu et al 2018 among the morphology categories fibrous particles were the most common fig 6 a accounting for 77 8 91 6 ce and 83 4 91 5 ecs of all particles in the three months followed by film 5 6 17 4 ce and 5 8 15 9 ecs and fragments 0 6 6 ce 0 10 2 ecs the dominance of fibers in our study was consistent with previous studies enders et al 2015 gallagher et al 2016 lahens et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 and it has been suggested that the fiber is of land based origin browne et al 2011 experimental studies found that 1900 fibers could be shed per machine wash and over 700 000 fibers could be released from a mean 6 kg wash load of acrylic fabric napper and thompson 2016 these fibers within the waste effluent from washing machines will be transported to sewage treatment plants some of these fibers are able to pass through the screens present at sewage treatments and enter into the aquatic environment dris et al 2015 napper and thompson 2016 shanghai city located within the ce is currently the most developed approximately 370 billion usd of gross domestic product in 2015 and populated ca 24 15 million inhabitants city in china shanghai statistical yearbook 2016 it has been demonstrated that the dense population and economic development in mega cities contributes to mp contamination in the aquatic environment lahens et al 2018 peng et al 2018 a recent study by bai et al 2018 corroborated this notion they reported that a coastal sewage plant in shanghai could release 1 456 trillion mp per day into the ce 74 44 of which were fibers bai et al 2018 luo et al 2019 also reported a high proportion of fibers 66 in the water samples from the ce luo et al 2019 additionally atmospheric fallout is also a way for land originated fibers to move into the aquatic environment dris et al 2016 generally microbeads found in the environment are mainly sourced from cosmetics such as facial cleaners body washes and toothpastes napper et al 2015 which are produced in the size range of 74 250 μm although microbeads occupy the lower end of the 0 1 5000 μm scale they should have been retained by our 60 μm stainless steel sieve during the filtering of water samples in the field unexpectedly no microbeads were found in our study compared to other morphologies film and fragments smaller microbeads with high surface area to volume ratios are prone to fouling and sink rapidly fazey and ryan 2016 as indicated by two field studies by analyzing sediment samples in the ce and ecs peng et al 2017 found that microbeads accounted for 1 of the total mp counts n 570 whereas peng et al 2018 reported that spherical particles constituted 89 0 of mp in the sediments of the huangpu river which is the last tributary of the changjiang river and flows through shanghai city into the south branch these studies suggest that the microbeads sank into the sediments of the huangpu river before entering the ce twelve polymer types were identified using micro ftir fig 6b polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp the most widely used polymer types in non fiber plastic products geyer et al 2017 comprised the majority of polymers in this study polyester pet accounts for over 50 of global fiber production hernandez et al 2017 it accounted for 6 5 and 5 3 of the particles in the samples in the ce and ecs in february 2017 however pet was absent in the samples in may and july 2017 although this does not necessarily indicate its absence at these sites polyamide pa nylon is also one major component of fiber production and is extensively used as a material for fishing gear manufacturing sala et al 2018 styrene acrylonitrile san polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polycarbonate pc polyurethane pu polyvinyl alcohol pva acrylate styrene acrylonitrile asa and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs have been frequently identified in asian seawater samples cai et al 2018 lahens et al 2018 ng and obbard 2006 song et al 2015 tsang et al 2017 xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 3 5 comparing plastic loads between ce and global estuaries nets with mesh sizes of 333 or 335 μm are the most commonly employed samplers in aquatic mp research hidalgo ruz et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 to better understand mp contamination in the ce comparisons between our results and those in other estuaries that also depended on bulk water samples are important the abundance mean 79 4 60 8 n m3 a range of 10 260 n m3 of mp 300 5000 μm in the ce was calculated by removing the smaller sized fraction 60 300 μm in general the mp 300 5000 μm abundance of the ce was in the upper range of concentrations measured in other estuaries fig 7 the mp abundance 300 5000 μm in the ce in this study is comparable to that 335 5000 μm 83 5 particles m3 reported in the surface water in the strait of juan de fuca salish sea hansen 2016 the high pollution level of mp in the ce could be explained by the close proximity of the most densely populated area worldwide where effluents containing mp inputs from the surrounding large wastewater treatment plants enter into the aquatic environment the values reported in charleston harbor 6600 particles m3 and winyah bay 30 800 particles m3 gray et al 2018 were two to three orders of magnitude higher than that in our study and could mainly be attributed to the smaller sieve size 63 μm used to process the sea surface microlayer samples 4 l sample inconsistent methodologies among the current literature must be considered when comparing these studies based on mp abundance 60 5000 μm we estimate 16 20 trillion mp particles weighing 537 6 905 9 tons annually entered the sea through the top water layer of the changjiang river table 1 based on the model and datasets used by lebreton et al 2017 the low mid and high mp loads of the changjiang river were 0 9 105 1 0 105 1 5 105 tons year which were 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than our estimates this striking disparity between the two studies could mainly be attributed to the different mp mass values empolyed an empirical average mass of mp 0 003 g particle used by lebreton et al 2017 is almost 2 orders of magnitude higher than our measured mass 0 000033 g particle lebreton et al 2017 calculated this mean mass based on the numerical concentrations and mass reported by eriksen et al 2014 in their study the abundance and weight of mp was estimated by counting and weighting the mp captured by the 330 μm neuston nets however the composition of mp morphologies e g fibers and fragments was not provided eriksen et al 2014 mp data by zhao et al 2014 which was composed of 79 1 fiber was used to estimate the plastic flux of changjiang river by lebreton et al 2017 in present study over 80 of mp were fibrous particles fig 6a the similar fiber proportions in both studies implied the empirical mp mass averaged by the oceanic mp particles was not applicable to riverine samples and lebreton et al 2017 largely overestimated the mp loads of the changjiang river furthermore this discrepancy of mp loads between two studies also suggests that high mp numerical concentrations do not necessarily mean that high mp mass in our study the average mp mass 0 000033 g particle was generated by weighing selected fibrous and fragmented particles together which might lead bias on the mean weight due to the mass disparity of two types of mp to improve the estimation of plastic loads into the ocean from rivers the mass of fibers and fragments should be individually measured and reproted supplementing the traditional method of reporting plastic numbers however our plastic load estimate also exhibits some uncertainties inside the ce surface mp abundance was influenced by the water density stratification during february and may the salty ocean water intrudes into the ce xue et al 2009 when tidal velocity is small strong density stratification is formed inside the estuary thus making the mixed layer depth shallower this causes mp to be concentrated in the upper mixed layer and thus higher mp abundances are observed under the strong stratification condition when tidal velocity is large stratification becomes weaker due to strong mixing mp may distribute through the depth of the sampling station mp abundances under the weak stratification condition are lower as shown in fig 8 during february and may mp abundances in the ce increased as the stratification became stronger fig 8 due to high river discharge in july salt intrusion inside the ce was much more limited and the water at the observed stations was largely uninfluenced by the salt water intrusion from the ocean and thus the water column at the observed stations was well mixed δρ 0 1 kg m3 at all stations therefore the impacts of stratification on the vertical distribution of mp during july are negligible in conclusion the surface mp abundances may be influenced by the stratification strength inside the estuary especially when the water is well mixed and mp may distribute throughout the depth of the sampling station if we calculate the plastic mass passing the estuary only through the data at the surface errors may occur additionally tidal action within the estuaries could lead to a mixing of plastic debris that derive either from the river or from the sea sadri and thompson 2014 schmidt et al 2017a b the ce is a semi diurnal mesotidal estuary with a mean tide range of 2 66 m hence the effect of tides on the plastic load should not be neglected to counteract tidal effects those datasets from estuaries were excluded in the model by schmidt et al 2017a when they estimated the plastic loads from rivers to the sea however the last station datong at the changjiang river which are not tidally influenced is located about 620 km from the river mouth and upstream from one of the most economically developed and densely inhabited areas of china gao et al 2012 a positive relationship has been found between measures of urban intensity e g population density and urban development and plastic pollution levels in rivers xiong et al 2019 moreover xiong et al 2019 found that a considerable amount of microplastics generated in large river catchments are not delivered to the sea to offset tidal effects we simply assume that only half the time the tide is pushing litter out into the marine environment in the ce hence the plastic load was divided by 2 which was used by van der wal et al 2015 who estiamted the plastic flux of european rivers finally the annual mp load ranging from 268 8 to 453 0 tons was estimated in our study it should be noted that this assumption is over simplification in light of these an optimum sampling strategy should be built in the further for instance plastic samplings within the estuaries over tidal cycles and hydrodynamic measurements are conducted simultaneously which could generate the estimations free of the tidal effects gao et al 2008 additionally long term continuous observations covering the surface middle depth and bottom of the sampling stations should be performed which would more accurately quantify the mp riverine transport process and the influence of physical processes thus improving our understanding of the role of rivers in delivering inland plastic debris to the ocean 4 conclusions the role of rivers as a major transport pathway for all sizes of plastic debris generated inland to the marine environment is of increasing ecological concern and is widely recognized lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017a siegfried et al 2017 the changjiang river as one of the largest rivers worldwide has been ranked as the largest plastic waste contributing catchment to the marine environment lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017a based on an intensive sampling of the surface waters in the ce and ecs the spatial and temporal patterns of mp were studied distinct seasonal variations in mp abundances in the studied regions were detected which was probably caused by the higher rainfall in the wet season patchy distributions of floating mp were observed in the ecs in all months seasonality in the mean size of mp across the sampling regions was also observed mean size in may was apparently smaller than that in february and july large temporal variations suggest that the estimates of riverine plastic to the sea may be biased if studies are conducted only during the wet or dry season the distinctly lower mp mass 0 000033 g particle suggested that mp fluxes in previous studies lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017a were overestimated and the measurements of mp mass should be included in the further research without considering tidal effects 16 20 trillion mp particles weighing 537 6 905 9 tons flow through the surface layer around 30 cm depth of the ce annually for more reasonable plastic flux of the world s rivers standardized monitoring methods high sampling resolution at spatial and temporal scales as well as the hydrodynamic data should be

18714,the role of rivers as a major transport pathway for all sizes of plastic debris into the ocean is widely recognized global modelling studies ranked the changjiang river as the largest contributor of plastic waste to the marine environment but these estimates were based on insufficient empirical data to better understand the role of rivers in delivering terrestrial plastic debris to the ocean the spatial and temporal patterns of microplastics mp in the changjiang estuary ce and the east china sea ecs were studied based on surface water samples in february may and july 2017 a total of 3225 mp 60 5000 μm were identified by fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometry mp abundance in july was higher than in february and may due to higher river discharge density stratification in ce significantly influenced the surface mp abundances a temporal accumulation zone within the river sea interface for plastics was indicated by stations with apparently higher abundances in the river plume fibers were the most common mp 80 over three months small mp 1000 μm composed 75 0 of the total plastics on average the average mass of mp was 0 000033 g particle which was two orders of magnitude lower than the empirical mass in literature without considering tidal effects we estimate 16 20 trillion mp particles weighing 537 6 905 9 tons entered the sea through the surface water layer of the changjiang river in 2017 these findings of this study provide reliable information on mp waste in a large river which should be considered in further studies for estimating the riverine plastic loads graphical abstract image 1 keywords plastic debris microplastic plastic loads river changjiang estuary east china sea 1 introduction plastic contamination has become one of the most pressing environmental issues geyer et al 2017 estimated that approximately 6300 million tons of plastic waste have been generated worldwide from 1950 to 2015 a fraction of which ultimately enters the marine environment geyer et al 2017 plastic waste in the global ocean is estimated to be more than 150 million tons neufeld et al 2016 roughly 80 of ocean macroplastic debris 5 mm have terrestrial origins dauvergne 2018 while 98 of microplastics mp 5 mm are from land based sources boucher and friot 2017 macroplastics have been the subject of environmental studies for some time however in the past decade the focus has shifted on the ubiquitous mp which are made up of small plastics derived from the fragmentation of macroplastics and are of microscopic size galloway and lewis 2017 rivers are considered as an important vector for the transport of different types of debris into the sea rech et al 2014 sadri and thompson 2014 a better understanding of the role of rivers in transporting plastics into the ocean is crucial for clarifying the sources pathways and mass balance of ocean plastics recently plastic debris loads of global rivers into the ocean were modeled based on global mismanged plastic waste annually 1 15 2 41 million tons of plastic waste currently enter the ocean from rivers worldwide with 74 of emissions occurring between may and october lebreton et al 2017 similarly schmidt et al 2017a b estimated that 0 41 4 0 million tons of land based plastic debris are transported by rivers into the ocean each year schmidt et al 2017a furthermore both the above studies noted that the top polluting rivers mostly located in asia accounted for 67 94 of the global plastic load based on their caculations the changjiang river was regarded as the largest contributor worldwide delivering 0 15 0 33 million tons of platic waste both macro and micro plastic per year into the adjacent east china sea ecs lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017a however estimates from both studies are uncertain due to the sparse and hetergeneous datasets data from different studies on riverine mp that were compiled and analyzed by the models vary significantly which is likely attributed to the sampling design collection devices analysis methods and report units for instance no more than three or four consecutive measurements were found in the dataset used by schmidt et al 2017a as one of the largest rivers in the world mp in the changjiang estuary ce is poorly studied zhao et al 2014 filtered water samples 12 20 l per sample through 32 μm sieves and reported that the mean suspended mp abundance in the ce yangtze estuary was 4137 n m3 zhao et al 2014 however this estimate was based on a sole sampling campaign in july and the lack of chemical identification of the suspected plastic particles in this study inevitably led to significant errors hidalgo ruz et al 2012 luo et al 2019 recently studied mp pollution in the ce and the ecs by filtering 5 l surface water through 20 μm nylon filters and reported the mean abundance of mp in the estuary and coastal water to be 900 n m3 luo et al 2019 by studing the microplastic at 15 sites along the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river changjiang river xiong et al 2019 obtained a range of mp abundance from 1 95 105 to 9 00 105 items km2 they also suggested that a considerable amount of mp from the large river cathments did not reach the sea in the present study a much larger number of surface water samples 100 l per sample were collected from the ce and est during three cruises in different seasons winter spring and summer the spatial and temporal features of floating mp 60 5000 μm abundance distribution and composition in the studied region were analyzed which could assist in identifying the spatial and seasonal patterns of plastic transport fluxes from the land to sea and support the implementation of cost effective monitoring and source mitigation efforts furthermore we compared the overall mp 300 5000 μm abundance in the ce with global estuaries and roughly estimated the plastic load passing through ce into the esc our results should improve the assessment of plastic load from rivers to the sea 2 materials and methods 2 1 1 sampling mp were collected during three research cruises 15 28 february 2017 5 23 may 2017 and 18 july 3 august 2017 onboard the r v run jiang no 1 in the ce and the ecs fig 1 detailed information of the studied region and sampling sites is provided in the supplementary data and the excel sheet water samples were collected using a screw pump which was deployed at around 30 cm depth on the front port side of the ship for each sample 100 l water was pumped into a high density polyethylene hdpe tank with a metal tap at the bottom all samples within the ce were taken during the ebb phase only the collected waters were filtered through a stainless steel sieve pore size 60 μm the retained materials on the sieve were flushed into clean 250 ml poly tetra fluoroethylene bottles with milli q water samples were stored at 5 c prior to analysis one sample 100 l waters was collected at each sampling site during the february cruise while three replicates 100 l 3 were sampled during the may and july cruises detailed information of the samples is listed in table s1 the profiles of temperature salinity and density at each station were measured with a conductivity temperature and depth ctd device sea bird electronics 25 bellevue wa usa 2 2 laboratory analyses in the lab samples were transferred into clean glass beakers and digested with 30 h2o2 solution at 60 c to eliminate organic matter this step was repeated if necessary until the solution was clear in appearance the contents were then filtered through 0 45 μm sartorius filters 47 mm diameter an individual filter was stored in a glass petri dish and examined under a stereo microscope leicam165 fc at magnification 160 based on summarized criteria from previous research nor and obbard 2014 zhao et al 2014 2016 a detailed protocol is provided in the supplementary data suspected particles were marked with red circles on the filter the particles were then photographed and measured for the largest dimension using the built in leica application suite x software particles within the range of 60 5000 μm were enumerated based on morphology the suspected particles were categorized into fiber film and fragments finally all particles were analyzed using micro fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy bruker lumos germany in attenuated total reflectance atr mode each scan was accumulated as the average of 32 scans in the spectral range of 600 4000 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 three replicate atr ftir spectra were acquired on different spots of each particle each spectrum was compared against a database from bruker to verify the polymer type matching spectra with a quality index 70 were accepted 2 3 contamination prevention utmost precautions were taken to prevent sample contamination throughout the entire research process prior to use the hdpe graduated tanks and steel sieves were thoroughly washed with milli q water and then double covered with tinfoil in the field prior to their first use at each sampling site all containers e g the hdpe tanks and ptfe bottles were rinsed with 60 μm filtered in situ seawater in the laboratory the measurements reported by zhao et al 2017 were employed all of the liquid reagents and media were filtered through 0 45 μm glass filters whatman gf f glassware such as beakers filtration system glass filters petri dishes tinfoil and pasteur pipettes is recommended for use as much as possible during the entire procedure and should be rinsed with milli q water and heated at 450 c for 8 h to combust any organic materials during the procedure the clean glassware should be covered with combusted tinfoil wherever and whenever possible steel tweezers were washed with milli q water and sterilized under a flame prior to use all sample handling was carried out under a clean laminar flow cabinet personal protective ware such as nitrile gloves and cotton lab coats were worn during the laboratory activities air was drawn through three clean filters 0 45 μm sartorius during the plastic separation in the lab to determine the potential airborne particle contamination a mixture of filtered 30 h2o2 solution and milli q water in three combusted glass tubes was run through the whole processing procedure as process blanks 2 4 mp load through the ce the yearly mp mass in the surface layer around 30 cm depth passing through the ce was estimated using the following equation l o a d c e i 1 4 c i m a s s m i c r o d i s c h a r g e i d i s c h a r g e r a t i o i 3 10 6 where l o a d c e tons year is the annual plastic flux input to the ocean a sum of plastic masses of the four seasons spring summer fall and winter the symbol i represents the four seasons c i is the mean mp concentration n m3 of each month in corresponding season based on the river discharge and rainfall the datasets sampling in february may and july represent the mp abundances in the winter spring and summer of the year three measured mp concentrations were designed as the concentration in the fall representing the low midpoint and high values table 1 m a s s m i c r o is the averaged mp mass per particle 0 000033 g the average mass of mp was generated by measuring three subsamples of randomly selected plastic items from the ce for each replicate 100 identified plastics composing of 80 fibrous and 20 non fibrous particles were selected under the stereo microscope leicam165 fc and put on small pieces of pre weighed filter disc to reduce tare weight as low as possible d i s c h a r g e i m3 month was taken as the monthly averaged discharge of each season in changjiang river which were obtained from yangtze river sediment bulletin the changjiang water conservancy committee 2017 d i s c h a r g e r a t i o i is the proportional discharge rate through the top 30 cm it is under the assumption the discharge rate is constant throughout all depths which we aware is an over simplification d i s c h a r g e r a t i o i was calculated from the depth around 30 cm divided by the average water depth of the sampling stations in three months miller et al 2017 the ratio is under the assumption that the discharge is constant throughout all depths all the parameters used to estimate plastic loads were shown in table 1 2 5 statistical analysis the kruskal wallis test was used to analyze multiple comparisons if the test indicated significant differences pairwise comparisons were performed using the wilcoxon test in all tests an alpha level of 0 05 was used data are reported as mean standard deviation sd surfer 11 golden software llc golden co usa was used to draw contour lines based on kriging interpolation the strength of stratification is indicated by the density difference δρ between the bottom and surface of each station 3 results and discussion 3 1 mp abundance no plastic particles were present in our process blanks but natural material based fibrous particles either cotton or rayon semi synthetics were found on the air sucked filters fig s1 which were not enumerated in results of this study plastics were found in 99 205 207 of all samples a total of 3225 mp 60 5000 μm were confirmed by atr ftir the overall mean mp concentrations in ce and ecs were 157 2 75 8 n m3 and 112 8 51 1 n m3 respectively mp abundance in the ce was over 25 times lower than that 4137 3 2461 5 n m3 measured by zhao et al 2014 although both studies used pumps to collect samples this disparity may be primarily attributed to the lack of validation of the chemical matrix of the plastic like particles using complementary methods e g spectroscopic and thermo chemical methods by zhao et al 2014 the plastic identification by zhao et al 2014 was exclusively based on visual inspection using light microscopy visual identification alone has been reported to result in a high misidentification rate ranging from 20 eriksen et al 2013 to 70 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 mp concentrations in the sediment samples from similar locations in europe showed ca 100 fold differences between the visual identification data and ftir data claessens et al 2011 liebezeit and dubaish 2012 furthermore the visual identification error rate increases with decreasing particle size löder et al 2015 all particles in this study were identified by atr ftir guaranteeing the accuracy of polymer identification additionally smaller sampling volumes 20 or 12 l per sample in 2014 could result in highly variable concentrations lusher et al 2014 tamminga et al 2018 recently luo et al 2019 reported the average mp abundance in both the ce and est to be 900 n m3 which is higher than our results in the ce 157 2 n m3 and ecs 112 8 n m3 the 20 μm filters employed by luo et al 2019 in comparison to 60 μm in our study might primarily contribute to this difference the temporality of plastic pollution levels also contributed to this difference seasonal conditions play a significant role in the transportation of litter by rivers to the sea and lead to several orders of magnitude variation between plastic abundances at different periods lebreton et al 2017 van der wal et al 2015 vianelloa et al 2015 the concentration of the ce in this study was averaged from the data in february may and july 2017 spanning the lower to higher discharge rates of the changjiang river however the concentration in the ce in zhao et al 2014 was based only on a single sampling in july which might be largely biased in comparison to the abundance of mp in the ce in this study this emphasizes that long term systematic monitoring research for plastic litter items in the riverine environment is necessary to obtain more realistic and representative abundances of plastic debris in the future the average concentration in the ecs 112 8 51 1 n m3 was three orders of magnitude larger than a previous study 0 167 0 138 n m3 identified using 333 μm manta net samples zhao et al 2014 similarly mp abundances in the ecs were several orders of magnitude greater than other studies that used net trawls with various mesh sizes as the sampling device table s2 the bulk water sampling methods utilized in current studies have mainly contributed to this large disparity to determine the influence of variable sampling techniques net based and bulk sampling approaches have been compared in several studies in the south china sea the mp concentration 0 045 0 093 n m3 of the 333 μm bongo net samples was four orders of magnitude lower than that of pumping waters samples 2569 1770 n m3 at a depth of 0 5 m cai et al 2018 di mauro et al 2017 also found that mp concentrations 20 000 6000 particles m3 in niskin samples collected at approximately 1 m 5 m and 10 m from the sea surface were several orders of magnitude greater than either bongo 4 6 0 8 n m3 or neuston nets 8 6 2 0 n m3 at sampling sites in the northern gulf of mexico the contamination level determined by manta trawling was 0 07 0 02 n m3 in contrast to that of 1030 800 n m3 by bulk sampling from three depths 0 5 m 2 0 m and 5 0 m in the south funen archipelago baltic sea tamminga et al 2018 two factors likely explained the order of magnitude disparity in mp concentrations between the bulk water and the net based samples first the detection limitation of the plastic by net sampling is dependent on the mesh size selected as expected a smaller mesh size can retain considerably more plastics than a larger mesh size song et al found that mp abundance in 50 μm hand net samples 1443 3353 particles m3 was significantly larger than in manta trawling samples 47 192 particles m3 song et al 2014 mp abundance in coastal swedish waters in 80 μm and 450 μm mesh samples varied by up to six orders of magnitude norén 2007 a typical manta trawl cannot sample mp particles smaller than 300 μm resulting in the omission of smaller sized fractions second smaller and larger particles can be either forced aside from the net opening or squeezed out through the mesh for example particles e g fibers with lower aspect ratios can easily pass through the net by aligning themselves with the flow direction setälä et al 2016 particle size spectrum theory in the marine environment predicts that abundance increases with decreasing particle size sheldon and parsons 1967 on average 29 4 of mp particles in our study were smaller than 0 3 mm fig 6abc table s3 this suggested that studies extrapolating neuston tow data to worldwide abundances cózar et al 2014 eriksen et al 2014 may similarly underestimate mp abundance in the sea 3 2 temporality of mp abundances mp abundances in the ce and ecs varied considerably across the three months fig 2 table s1 mp concentrations in the ce were apparently different among the different months as well as that in the ecs kruskal wallis test p ce 4 10 10 4 p ecs 1 19 10 5 the concentrations in july of the ce and ecs were apparently higher than those of the other months influenced by the east asian monsoon the studied area in july 2017 was characterized by the highest level of rainfall among the three sampling seasons resulting in an increased river flux into the estuary which likely explained the seasonality of mp abundance mismanaged waste generated in the river basin could migrate toward the estuarine portion following the river flow plastic litter retained in the adjacent areas around the estuary can be flushed into the waterways more frequently in the rainy season than the dry season eventually entering into the adjacent sea lima et al 2014 moore et al 2002 zhao et al 2015 this distinct seasonality in mp abundance emphasizes that temporal variations must be also considered when monitoring the levels of plastic pollution within a region that has high seasonal variations in rainfall an overestimation of 53 9 in the ce and 55 7 in the ecs would occur if the average abundance of mp in this study was calculated solely from the data obtained in july 3 3 patchy distribution of mp no differences were found between mp abundances in the ce and ecs of each month wilcoxon test february p 0 99 may 0 73 july 0 66 however the abundances fluctuated highly among the sampling sites within each month the average mp abundance of each site ranged from 20 0 to 290 n m3 in the ce and 10 0 to 647 6 n m3 in the ecs fig 3 a high spatial heterogeneity of mp abundance on a smaller scale has been shown previously goldstein et al 2013 unexpectedly the highest mp concentrated sites sites a2 5 a8 2 a8 4 in february a9 4 a10 3 a11 1 in may a4 6 d3 e4 in july fig 3 in this study were all located in the ecs and not in the internal estuary ce which is inconsistent with a previous study that reported higher mp abundances in the estuary than in the ecs zhao et al 2014 the patchiness in the floating mp distribution is probably related to the following factors 1 plastic particles display an increasing frequency distribution skewed toward smaller size classes in many studies cózar et al 2014 mp size at sites with higher abundance in the ecs were considerably smaller than those from estuarine sites fig 4 the fast flux of smaller sized mp within limited distances from the coast depending on the fast fragmentation of terrestrial plastic debris may contribute to this size disparity pedrotti et al 2016 2 plastics at the sea possess more variant origins due to the high dispersion mp at the sea may come from both the land and sea in the ecs the northward kuroshio branch current kbc and taiwan warm current twc were steady and may transport floating plastic litter to our study area the kuroshio current system has been thought to deliver plastic waste from asia to the great pacific garbage lebreton et al 2018 due to the instantaneous sampling in the current study other factors e g tidal currents wind eddies river flow vertical mixing and wave action may also contribute to the surges in mp abundance at some sampling sites resulting in temporal patches for floating mp schmidt et al 2017b van der hal et al 2017 3 4 characteristics of mp mp size in this study ranged from 60 to 4953 μm and displayed an asymmetrical frequency distribution skewed toward smaller size classes fig 5abc particles smaller than 300 μm accounted for 29 4 of the total number ranging from 21 8 to 30 6 in ce and ecs across the different months and regions fig 5abc and table s3 furthermore mp 1 mm a size specific loss of floating plastic in the open ocean cózar et al 2014 comprised 75 0 of the total number and varied from 68 2 to 86 3 the large fractions of smaller sized mp corroborated that of studies based on the commonly used net trawl sampling technique which might miss considerable plastic debris in the surface waters and contribute considerably to the missing plastic in the global ocean cózar et al 2014 the mean size of mp in the ce varied significantly over the three sampling months kruskal wallis test p 4 1 10 3 as well as that in the ecs kruskal wallis test p 1 3 10 11 the particle size in may was apparently smaller than the measurements in february and july wilcoxon test p 1 0 10 14 7 7 10 6 in the ecs p 0 01 0 01 in the ce fig 5 d though plastics are designed to be persistent physical factors e g wave action and wind and uv light enhance their fragmentation in the environment depending on the exposure time andrady 2011 however the short interval between samplings in this study may not have allowed the plastics to become sufficiently photo degraded this temporal pattern in mean size could be largely ascribed to heavy rainfall during the wet season at the beginning of the wet season may mp in the changjiang catchment which had become brittle and fragmented into smaller sized particles due to multiple factors e g uv wind exposure to air were probably flushed into the ce and the adjacent ecs a similar result was reported by gündoğdu et al 2018 who found that the average size of the floating mp in the mersin bay decreased from 2 37 mm in the pre flood period to 1 13 mm in the post flood period gündoğdu et al 2018 among the morphology categories fibrous particles were the most common fig 6 a accounting for 77 8 91 6 ce and 83 4 91 5 ecs of all particles in the three months followed by film 5 6 17 4 ce and 5 8 15 9 ecs and fragments 0 6 6 ce 0 10 2 ecs the dominance of fibers in our study was consistent with previous studies enders et al 2015 gallagher et al 2016 lahens et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 and it has been suggested that the fiber is of land based origin browne et al 2011 experimental studies found that 1900 fibers could be shed per machine wash and over 700 000 fibers could be released from a mean 6 kg wash load of acrylic fabric napper and thompson 2016 these fibers within the waste effluent from washing machines will be transported to sewage treatment plants some of these fibers are able to pass through the screens present at sewage treatments and enter into the aquatic environment dris et al 2015 napper and thompson 2016 shanghai city located within the ce is currently the most developed approximately 370 billion usd of gross domestic product in 2015 and populated ca 24 15 million inhabitants city in china shanghai statistical yearbook 2016 it has been demonstrated that the dense population and economic development in mega cities contributes to mp contamination in the aquatic environment lahens et al 2018 peng et al 2018 a recent study by bai et al 2018 corroborated this notion they reported that a coastal sewage plant in shanghai could release 1 456 trillion mp per day into the ce 74 44 of which were fibers bai et al 2018 luo et al 2019 also reported a high proportion of fibers 66 in the water samples from the ce luo et al 2019 additionally atmospheric fallout is also a way for land originated fibers to move into the aquatic environment dris et al 2016 generally microbeads found in the environment are mainly sourced from cosmetics such as facial cleaners body washes and toothpastes napper et al 2015 which are produced in the size range of 74 250 μm although microbeads occupy the lower end of the 0 1 5000 μm scale they should have been retained by our 60 μm stainless steel sieve during the filtering of water samples in the field unexpectedly no microbeads were found in our study compared to other morphologies film and fragments smaller microbeads with high surface area to volume ratios are prone to fouling and sink rapidly fazey and ryan 2016 as indicated by two field studies by analyzing sediment samples in the ce and ecs peng et al 2017 found that microbeads accounted for 1 of the total mp counts n 570 whereas peng et al 2018 reported that spherical particles constituted 89 0 of mp in the sediments of the huangpu river which is the last tributary of the changjiang river and flows through shanghai city into the south branch these studies suggest that the microbeads sank into the sediments of the huangpu river before entering the ce twelve polymer types were identified using micro ftir fig 6b polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp the most widely used polymer types in non fiber plastic products geyer et al 2017 comprised the majority of polymers in this study polyester pet accounts for over 50 of global fiber production hernandez et al 2017 it accounted for 6 5 and 5 3 of the particles in the samples in the ce and ecs in february 2017 however pet was absent in the samples in may and july 2017 although this does not necessarily indicate its absence at these sites polyamide pa nylon is also one major component of fiber production and is extensively used as a material for fishing gear manufacturing sala et al 2018 styrene acrylonitrile san polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polycarbonate pc polyurethane pu polyvinyl alcohol pva acrylate styrene acrylonitrile asa and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs have been frequently identified in asian seawater samples cai et al 2018 lahens et al 2018 ng and obbard 2006 song et al 2015 tsang et al 2017 xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 3 5 comparing plastic loads between ce and global estuaries nets with mesh sizes of 333 or 335 μm are the most commonly employed samplers in aquatic mp research hidalgo ruz et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 to better understand mp contamination in the ce comparisons between our results and those in other estuaries that also depended on bulk water samples are important the abundance mean 79 4 60 8 n m3 a range of 10 260 n m3 of mp 300 5000 μm in the ce was calculated by removing the smaller sized fraction 60 300 μm in general the mp 300 5000 μm abundance of the ce was in the upper range of concentrations measured in other estuaries fig 7 the mp abundance 300 5000 μm in the ce in this study is comparable to that 335 5000 μm 83 5 particles m3 reported in the surface water in the strait of juan de fuca salish sea hansen 2016 the high pollution level of mp in the ce could be explained by the close proximity of the most densely populated area worldwide where effluents containing mp inputs from the surrounding large wastewater treatment plants enter into the aquatic environment the values reported in charleston harbor 6600 particles m3 and winyah bay 30 800 particles m3 gray et al 2018 were two to three orders of magnitude higher than that in our study and could mainly be attributed to the smaller sieve size 63 μm used to process the sea surface microlayer samples 4 l sample inconsistent methodologies among the current literature must be considered when comparing these studies based on mp abundance 60 5000 μm we estimate 16 20 trillion mp particles weighing 537 6 905 9 tons annually entered the sea through the top water layer of the changjiang river table 1 based on the model and datasets used by lebreton et al 2017 the low mid and high mp loads of the changjiang river were 0 9 105 1 0 105 1 5 105 tons year which were 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than our estimates this striking disparity between the two studies could mainly be attributed to the different mp mass values empolyed an empirical average mass of mp 0 003 g particle used by lebreton et al 2017 is almost 2 orders of magnitude higher than our measured mass 0 000033 g particle lebreton et al 2017 calculated this mean mass based on the numerical concentrations and mass reported by eriksen et al 2014 in their study the abundance and weight of mp was estimated by counting and weighting the mp captured by the 330 μm neuston nets however the composition of mp morphologies e g fibers and fragments was not provided eriksen et al 2014 mp data by zhao et al 2014 which was composed of 79 1 fiber was used to estimate the plastic flux of changjiang river by lebreton et al 2017 in present study over 80 of mp were fibrous particles fig 6a the similar fiber proportions in both studies implied the empirical mp mass averaged by the oceanic mp particles was not applicable to riverine samples and lebreton et al 2017 largely overestimated the mp loads of the changjiang river furthermore this discrepancy of mp loads between two studies also suggests that high mp numerical concentrations do not necessarily mean that high mp mass in our study the average mp mass 0 000033 g particle was generated by weighing selected fibrous and fragmented particles together which might lead bias on the mean weight due to the mass disparity of two types of mp to improve the estimation of plastic loads into the ocean from rivers the mass of fibers and fragments should be individually measured and reproted supplementing the traditional method of reporting plastic numbers however our plastic load estimate also exhibits some uncertainties inside the ce surface mp abundance was influenced by the water density stratification during february and may the salty ocean water intrudes into the ce xue et al 2009 when tidal velocity is small strong density stratification is formed inside the estuary thus making the mixed layer depth shallower this causes mp to be concentrated in the upper mixed layer and thus higher mp abundances are observed under the strong stratification condition when tidal velocity is large stratification becomes weaker due to strong mixing mp may distribute through the depth of the sampling station mp abundances under the weak stratification condition are lower as shown in fig 8 during february and may mp abundances in the ce increased as the stratification became stronger fig 8 due to high river discharge in july salt intrusion inside the ce was much more limited and the water at the observed stations was largely uninfluenced by the salt water intrusion from the ocean and thus the water column at the observed stations was well mixed δρ 0 1 kg m3 at all stations therefore the impacts of stratification on the vertical distribution of mp during july are negligible in conclusion the surface mp abundances may be influenced by the stratification strength inside the estuary especially when the water is well mixed and mp may distribute throughout the depth of the sampling station if we calculate the plastic mass passing the estuary only through the data at the surface errors may occur additionally tidal action within the estuaries could lead to a mixing of plastic debris that derive either from the river or from the sea sadri and thompson 2014 schmidt et al 2017a b the ce is a semi diurnal mesotidal estuary with a mean tide range of 2 66 m hence the effect of tides on the plastic load should not be neglected to counteract tidal effects those datasets from estuaries were excluded in the model by schmidt et al 2017a when they estimated the plastic loads from rivers to the sea however the last station datong at the changjiang river which are not tidally influenced is located about 620 km from the river mouth and upstream from one of the most economically developed and densely inhabited areas of china gao et al 2012 a positive relationship has been found between measures of urban intensity e g population density and urban development and plastic pollution levels in rivers xiong et al 2019 moreover xiong et al 2019 found that a considerable amount of microplastics generated in large river catchments are not delivered to the sea to offset tidal effects we simply assume that only half the time the tide is pushing litter out into the marine environment in the ce hence the plastic load was divided by 2 which was used by van der wal et al 2015 who estiamted the plastic flux of european rivers finally the annual mp load ranging from 268 8 to 453 0 tons was estimated in our study it should be noted that this assumption is over simplification in light of these an optimum sampling strategy should be built in the further for instance plastic samplings within the estuaries over tidal cycles and hydrodynamic measurements are conducted simultaneously which could generate the estimations free of the tidal effects gao et al 2008 additionally long term continuous observations covering the surface middle depth and bottom of the sampling stations should be performed which would more accurately quantify the mp riverine transport process and the influence of physical processes thus improving our understanding of the role of rivers in delivering inland plastic debris to the ocean 4 conclusions the role of rivers as a major transport pathway for all sizes of plastic debris generated inland to the marine environment is of increasing ecological concern and is widely recognized lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017a siegfried et al 2017 the changjiang river as one of the largest rivers worldwide has been ranked as the largest plastic waste contributing catchment to the marine environment lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017a based on an intensive sampling of the surface waters in the ce and ecs the spatial and temporal patterns of mp were studied distinct seasonal variations in mp abundances in the studied regions were detected which was probably caused by the higher rainfall in the wet season patchy distributions of floating mp were observed in the ecs in all months seasonality in the mean size of mp across the sampling regions was also observed mean size in may was apparently smaller than that in february and july large temporal variations suggest that the estimates of riverine plastic to the sea may be biased if studies are conducted only during the wet or dry season the distinctly lower mp mass 0 000033 g particle suggested that mp fluxes in previous studies lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017a were overestimated and the measurements of mp mass should be included in the further research without considering tidal effects 16 20 trillion mp particles weighing 537 6 905 9 tons flow through the surface layer around 30 cm depth of the ce annually for more reasonable plastic flux of the world s rivers standardized monitoring methods high sampling resolution at spatial and temporal scales as well as the hydrodynamic data should be
