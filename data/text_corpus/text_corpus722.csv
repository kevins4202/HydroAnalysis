3610,soil moisture sm is a very important physical parameter in land surface processes the low resolution microwave products are extremely useful for large scale studies but are limited in their ability to resolve landscape level variability in this study to overcome this limitation we adopted three different deep learning based downscaling methods and performed a comparative analysis firstly a downscaling method based on a deep belief network dbn model with a fully connected structure was employed to fit the complex nonlinear relationship between soil moisture and the auxiliary surface parameters then to improve this simple point to point relationship a neighborhood constraint based improved dbn model was developed to consider the effect of local spatial correlation among the surface factors on soil moisture finally to maintain the integrity of the spatial structure in the process of model construction a residual network resnet model consisting of several residual dense blocks rdbs was introduced to use convolutions to obtain more complete and powerful spatial feature maps the tibetan plateau was selected as the study area because of its importance to the global water cycle the four soil moisture monitoring networks in the research area were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods in the downscaling of soil moisture products and four quantitative indicators were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the methods from the verified results it is shown that the three deep learning methods can maintain a higher correlation and better reduce the bias on the whole and the resnet model in particular shows a higher stability from the perspective of the spatial patterns and details when compared to back propagation neural network bpnn and random forest rf models the three deep learning methods can provide more feasible spatial patterns and details as well as reducing the uncertainty in the central regions of the tibetan plateau the resnet model shows a superior ability to enhance the texture details with lower uncertainty due to the fact that it can meet the requirements of fitting the soil moisture to complex surfaces furthermore the results of the resnet model can also effectively capture the temporal changes of the microwave soil moisture product well keywords soil moisture downscaling tibetan plateau deep learning multisource data 1 introduction soil moisture sm is an important climate variable which usually refers to the amount of water stored in the unsaturated soil zone it affects the coupling of temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration and plays a very important role in the global water cycle surface energy cycle drought assessment and ecological management seneviratne et al 2010 in situ observation can realize high precision measurement of sm in different shallow soil layers however within a site monitoring network the ground observation stations are often unevenly distributed and the number can be limited for example observations stations may be densely distributed in flat areas but sparsely distributed in high altitude steep slope areas in addition each observation station only represents the restricted point scale sm with which it is difficult to reflect the change of sm over an entire region murray et al 2011 paulik et al 2014 therefore the point measurements of sm are limited in spatial coverage which creates challenges for spatially continuous hydrologic monitoring robock et al 2000 owing to its characteristics of all day and all weather observation microwave remote sensing can detect sm at a depth of 5 cm in topsoil and can be used to achieve regional and even global long term large scale sm monitoring with minimal interference from vegetation and clouds engman and chauhan 1995 jackson and schmugge 1989 since the 1970s a series of active and passive remote sensing satellites and sensors have been launched to detect the changes of sm passive microwave sensors include the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr njoku et al 1980 the special sensor microwave imager ssm i de ridder 2003 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observation system kawanishi et al 2003 the fengyun 3 fy 3 meteorological satellite parinussa et al 2014 the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos satellite kerr et al 2001 and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 parinussa et al 2015 active microwave sensors include the advanced microwave instrument ami scatterometer bartalis et al 2007 and the c sar instrument on board the sentinel 1 satellite snoeij et al 2010 active and passive earth observation satellites include the soil moisture active passive smap satellite entekhabi et al 2010a entekhabi et al 2010b although active microwave detection can obtain relatively high resolution sm products the estimation accuracy is low due to the influence of surface roughness vegetation canopy structure and water content dubois et al 1995 passive microwave systems are suitable for large scale sm monitoring because they are less affected by vegetation and surface roughness and are more sensitive to sm than active microwave systems ulaby 1982 however due to the trade off in antenna size needed for a high resolution and the technical challenge of launching and operating a large antenna in space njoku and entekhabi 1996 sabaghy et al 2018 passive sm products are typically at a relatively low spatial resolution approximately 25 40 km which cannot meet fine scale application requirements higher resolution sm information at a resolution of several kilometers or even hundreds of meters is needed for crop growth models and water management applications fang et al 2018 to fill this gap downscaling the coarse scale sm products is necessary kerr et al 2007 peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2018 in recent years many methods have been developed to improve the spatial resolution of sm products obtained from satellite remote sensing one of the common downscaling methods is model based method which is divided into statistical models based on geostatistical properties kaheil et al 2008 and fractal scale properties of sm kim and barros 2002 and hydrological models such as land surface model ines et al 2013 and data assimilation sahoo et al 2013 although this method can capture the spatial sm pattern well its model parameters are difficult to obtain the second category of downscaling methods is active and passive microwave data fusion method which combines the characteristics of high spatial resolution data with the characteristics of high sensitivity to sm using this category of methods researchers have downscaled different kinds of microwave sm data such as smap data das et al 2014 and electronically scanned thinned array radiometer estar data bindlish and barros 2002 in order to obtain higher precision sm xiwu et al 2006 proposed a bayesian merging method and verified the results with the hydros observing system simulation experiment osse datasets however this category of downscaling method also faced with challenges such as the inconsistent observation time between the active and passive sensors the low radar revisit rate and the sensitivity of vegetation characteristics to radar backscattering wu et al 2014 compared with microwave remote sensing optical and thermal remote sensing systems have the advantage of being able to provide surface parameters with a higher spatial resolution therefore many studies have attempted to downscale microwave sm products based on optical thermal and microwave fusion methods by obtaining a downscaling factor from high resolution optical thermal data peng et al 2017 based on the land surface temperature lst vegetation index vi triangular feature space carlson et al 1994 zhan et al 2002 preliminarily proposed an empirical polynomial fitting downscaling method this was later developed into a downscaling method for the deep mining of spatial feature information by multifactor joint prediction chauhan et al 2003 djamai et al 2015 merlin et al 2010 nasta et al 2018 wang et al 2016 this method still presents challenges with swath width and the influence of clouds and vegetation in addition the assumption of a linear scaling relationship is not always satisfied wei et al 2019 owing to the advantage of machine learning in solving nonlinear problems srivastava et al 2013 evaluated the performance of artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm relevance vector machine rvm and generalized linear model glm methods in smos sm downscaling and showed that the ann algorithm can significantly improve the spatial resolution of smos satellite sm compared to svm rvm and glm the back propagation neural network bpnn as a classic machine learning algorithm has also been shown to be superior in sm downscaling compared with a regression algorithm jiang et al 2017 in addition some other classical machine learning methods are also widely used in downscaling microwave sm products to obtain higher resolution sm imagery such as gradient boosting decision tree gbdt wei et al 2019 random forest rf liu et al 2017 etc compared with the traditional shallow network architectures deep learning dl can learn semantic high level and deeper features lee et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 and has already been applied to estimate sm fang et al 2017 employed a long short term memory lstm model to robustly predict surface sm based on the atmospheric forcing time series and physiographic attributes then a convolutional neural network cnn model was employed to estimate sm through thermal infrared images and performed better than the typical deep neural network dnn sobayo et al 2018 however the application of dl to downscaling is still lacking especially for ignoring the spatial neighborhood relationships a cnn method is only utilized to obtain better downscaling results than the svm and rf algorithms xu et al 2021 however this method only uses the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and lst and ignores the influence of terrain on sm as a result the accuracy is significantly reduced when higher resolution sm data are generated due to the complex geographical environment of the tibetan plateau it is difficult for traditional methods to obtain high resolution and high precision downscaling results in this region to solve this problem our primary goal in this paper is to study novel dl based methods by considering spatial neighborhood relationship and the impact of terrain and achieve the product of high resolution and high accuracy sm data under large scale differences e g from 36 km to 1 km on tibetan plateau then we intend to comprehensively and systematically evaluate the dl based sm downscaling methods over a specific area by discussing the spatio temporal effects on the downscaling results and analyzing their scaling effect and uncertainty in this paper we obtained 1 km high accuracy smap sm products in 2016 and have made the following contributions 1 we apply deep belief network dbn to smap sm downscaling for the first time and proposed a neighborhood constraint based improved dbn nc dbn model by considering the spatial neighborhood relationship to obtain the downscaling results with smaller bias 2 to utilize the deep characteristics and spatial local relationships of images residual network resnet is applied to downscaling for the first time to obtain higher accuracy results compared to bpnn and rf 3 one classic and four dl based sm downscaling methods were comprehensively compared on spatial details and temporal trends dl based methods will provide more spatial details from downscaling predictors and capture the similar temporal variation combining scaling effect and uncertainty it can be observed that the method considering neighborhood relationship can obtain higher accuracy and more stable products the rest of this paper is organized as follows the study area and datasets are introduced in section 2 the adopted methods are described in section 3 the experimental results are compared and analyzed in section 4 the scale effect temporal stability and the uncertainty of the different methods are discussed in section 5 the contributions of this study and the future research prospects are summarized in section 6 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the tibetan plateau is the highest plateau in the world with an average altitude of 4500 m and an area of 2 5 million square kilometers as shown in fig 1 the tibetan plateau ranges from 25 81 n to 39 82 n and 68 02 e to 104 61 e the tibetan plateau is known as the water tower of asia as it has a very important influence on the asian monsoon global atmospheric circulation and climate change through the thermal and dynamic stress effects meng et al 2017 as an important hydrological parameter sm affects the surface atmosphere energy flux through evaporation and thus represents important feedback on regional precipitation and even the climate system huang and margulis 2013 neelin and lintner 2009 2 2 smap soil moisture product nasa s smap mission was launched on january 31 2015 the smap satellite uses an l band radiometer and l band radar to retrieve global surface sm 5 cm depth and achieves a global coverage every two to three days however on july 7 2015 the radar sensor of the smap satellite was damaged in this study the data of the smap l3 radiometer global daily 36 km equal area scalable earth ease grid soil moisture smap sm p product from the national snow and ice data center nsidc o neill et al 2018 were used table 1 shows that the data used in this study covered a timeframe of january 1 2016 to december 31 2016 366 days in total this level 3 l3 sm product provides a composite of daily estimates of the global land surface conditions retrieved by the smap passive microwave radiometer the smap l band sm data are resampled to a global cylindrical 36 km ease grid version 2 0 the descending and ascending half orbit passes of the smap satellite are at 6a m and 6p m local time respectively in this study we used both kinds of data i e ascending and descending orbit data 2 3 auxiliary modis data in this study the high resolution optical auxiliary data included ndvi lst and surface albedo data table 1 shows that the ndvi product selected for the experiment was the mod13a2 product which has a spatial and temporal resolution of 1 km 16 days the product selected for lst was mod11a2 which includes day lst day and night lst night data and has a spatial and temporal resolution of 1 km 8 days the product selected for the ndvi surface reflectance was mcd43a3 which has a spatial and temporal resolution of 500 m day these products covered a timeframe of january 1 to december 31 2016 all of the above data were obtained from nasa s level 1 and atmosphere archive and distribution system distributed active archive center 2 4 digital elevation model the digital elevation model dem data used in this study came from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm which was launched in 2002 to obtain digital elevation data of the earth s surface covering an area of more than 119 million square kilometers between 60 north and 56 south van zyl 2001 which represents more than 80 of the global land surface including the whole of china the dem data selected in this study covered the tibetan plateau with a spatial resolution of 90 m the dem data were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud xuezhi et al 2014 the downloaded srtm dem utm90m data are framing data so that mosaicing clipping and coordinate system conversion were needed 2 5 in situ soil moisture measurements the in situ observation results of the international soil moisture measurement network ismn were selected as the basis of the final accuracy evaluation the ismn is a centralized data hosting facility that provides global on site sm measurement data from operational networks the ismn uses soil volume moisture units to validate and improve satellite derived sm products dorigo et al 2011 according to the scope and time interval of the study area the ctp smtmn naqu maqu and ngari sm monitoring networks in the naqu maqu and ali regions of the tibetan plateau were selected yang et al 2013 su et al 2011 the field observation values of sm with a detection depth of 5 cm from the surface were selected a detailed description of the observation stations is provided in table 2 3 methodology the basic principle of the downscaling framework proposed in this paper is based on the assumption that the relationship between sm and the auxiliary surface parameters is scale invariant jiang et al 2017 that is the relationship established under low resolution condition can be applied to obtain high resolution sm by using high resolution cofactors the whole framework includes four parts data preprocessing model construction residual correction and result evaluation fig 2 shows the framework flow of the three sm downscaling methods used in this study firstly in the data preprocessing part the smap sm data and the auxiliary high resolution data were stitched clipped reprojected and resampled and the daily average of the site data was determined in this paper we use the nearest neighbor interpolation method to resample auxiliary data secondly in the part of model construction the relationship between sm and the auxiliary surface parameters was trained under the condition of a low resolution and the dl based sm downscaling model was obtained the auxiliary surface parameters were longitude latitude ndvi lst albedo and dem in the prediction the high resolution auxiliary surface parameters were input into the model to obtain a high resolution sm product thirdly in the residual correction low resolution images were used to calibrate the downscaling results to maintain the information of the original imagery finally in the evaluation part with the data from the four observation networks the site data and sm product were matched based on the longitude and latitude and four quantitative indicators were used to evaluate the accuracy precision and relevance of the downscaling results 3 1 data preprocessing the high resolution optical data were stitched cropped and reprojected and the unified coordinate system was the wgs 1984 geographic coordinate system the 0 5 cm depth data were selected from the site data for evaluation because the smap satellite s microwave sensor detects surface sm to ensure temporal consistency with the smap product the 24 h average as observed by the sites each day was adopted as the final evaluation basis the auxiliary data of longitude latitude ndvi lst albedo and dem were resampled to 1 and 36 km scales the auxiliary data with a resolution of 36 km and the coarse scale smap sm product were used to build the downscaling model the auxiliary data with a resolution of 1 km were used as the model input in the prediction stage many null values in the sm imagery of the smap satellite were noticed daily due to the influence of the satellite orbit scanning and topographic structure before the model training these null values and the auxiliary surface parameters corresponding to their grids were deleted and all the training data were normalized to 0 1 in the process of the model construction we divided all the data so that the training set accounted for 70 and the test set accounted for 30 for the different models the training set and test set were divided into the same proportions the smap ascending and descending orbit products were used for the model training the ascending orbit product corresponded to the surface temperature product at night whereas the descending orbit product corresponded to the surface temperature product during the day 3 2 deep learning methods for the downscaling of soil moisture 3 2 1 deep belief network as a classic dl model the dbn was proposed by hinton et al 2006 the dbn solved the training problem of the dnn and promoted the rapid development of dl it is a multilayer neural network structure with a good nonlinear fitting ability the dbn model was applied to the downscaling of the smap sm product as shown in fig a 1 in four steps firstly data pairs were extracted according to the longitude and latitude the longitude latitude ndvi lst albedo and dem data were used as inputs for the dbn network model and the smap sm product was used as the label data for the model secondly the missing values in the matched data pairs were removed the process of removing the missing values was to splice the vector of the input data and the vector of the label data into a 2d matrix according to the column the positions of the missing values in the matrix were detected row by row all the missing data in the whole row were eliminated and all the input data were normalized to 0 1 the label data did not need to be normalized because the distribution range of the smap sm product was between 0 and 1 thirdly the processed input data and label data were input into the dbn to train the model finally the high resolution auxiliary data were input into the trained model to obtain the high resolution sm product for the detailed process of the dbn algorithm please refer to appendix a 1 3 2 2 neighborhood constraint based improved deep belief network through point to point training the dbn model can fit the relationship between the sm and auxiliary surface parameters well but it does not consider the local geospatial characteristics of the auxiliary factors for sm products each pixel is affected by the neighborhood information of the auxiliary surface parameters to solve this problem a neighborhood constraint based improved dbn nc dbn model is proposed for each pixel its neighborhood information is extracted and a 3d cofactor block is constructed by combining this with the neighborhood information as shown in fig a 2 similar to the dbn downscaling model the nc dbn model uses the smap sm data as the label data to train the complex nonlinear model between the sm and auxiliary variables at a low resolution and then inputs auxiliary data with a high spatial resolution into the model for prediction neighborhood operations need to be employed on the low resolution data in the training and the high resolution data in the testing to maintain the consistency of the dimensions fig a 2 shows that to make full use of the edge information of the imagery an edge padding operation is first performed on the auxiliary factor the image size is expanded by copying the value in the outer boundary assuming that the spatial resolution of the auxiliary image is w h then the resolution after the edge padding operation becomes w 2 h 2 in this study a 3 3 matrix was used for the pixel by pixel scanning to obtain the information of the nine pixels in the neighborhood of each pixel and a w h 9 3d matrix was finally formed in this manner the amount of input data for the model was greatly increased from one pixel to nine pixels in its neighborhood the weight and bias items were fitted through the network structure of the dbn model neighborhood operations were conducted on the four variables of longitude latitude lst and ndvi which were then converted into 3d cofactor blocks although the spatial neighborhood information of the auxiliary surface parameters is considered in the nc dbn model the spatial structure is not constrained therefore dropout and l2 regularization were added into the model to restrict the smoothness of the structure the loss function and l2 regularization are shown in eq 1 1 l λ ω 1 2 n i 1 n y i f x i 2 2 λ ω 2 2 where lλ is the loss function ω is the weight n is the number of sample pairs in the training set y represents the original sm x represents six auxiliary variables f represents the established model and λ is the regular term coefficient van laarhoven 2017 3 2 3 resnet although the dbn model can fit the nonlinear relationship well it does not consider the neighborhood information the nc dbn model takes into account the neighborhood information of the auxiliary surface parameters but it cannot maintain the spatial integrity in the model training in dl convolution can realize feature extraction without changing the structure of the original imagery traore et al 2018 hence using a cnn to train the model was considered as a further development of the cnn the resnet model he et al 2016 has been used in target detection machine translation face recognition and other fields ling et al 2019 pham et al 2020 wang et al 2019 the resnet model can also reduce gradient explosion achieve deeper training and realize multiple utilization of shallow features through skip connections therefore a downscaling method incorporating a resnet model is proposed the longitude and latitude data were transformed into a 2d image matrix to train the resnet model the specific steps were as follows firstly the auxiliary images were stacked where the auxiliary images included longitude latitude ndvi lst albedo and dem images secondly the feature map was obtained by using the convolution kernel to scan pixel by pixel thirdly the mask of the original smap image data was calculated and mask processing of the feature map was carried out differing from traditional imagery the satellite imagery of sm often contains missing information due to the influence of orbit scanning and topography thus if the loss function between the feature image and the smap image is calculated directly then an error will occur in this study the strategy shown in fig a 3 a was adopted the sm mask was calculated based on the original smap image and then the mask was processed on the feature image to obtain the pseudo sm image finally the estimated sm product and the original smap product were used to calculate the loss function to carry out back propagation and optimize the model fig a 3 b shows the structure of the resnet architecture used in this study firstly the first convolutional layer extracts the shallow feature f 1 of the surface auxiliary parameters and then the second convolutional layer further extracts feature f0 as the input of the rdbs the purpose of the rdbs is to cascade features of different levels to enhance information flow transmission the calculation of the output fd of the d th rdb is shown in eq 2 2 f d h rdb d f d 1 h rdb d h rdb d 1 h rdb d f 0 where hrdb d is a compound function which represents the convolution and activation operation the selected activation function is the rectified linear unit relu function and the calculation of the last layer involves the use of the previous layer the relu is used to enhance the nonlinear characteristics of the imagery dense feature fusion including global feature fusion gff and global residual learning grl is then further performed gff involves the fusion of the features processed by the different rdb modules and grl involves introducing the features of the original surface parameters into the features processed by the rdb module the global feature fgf is extracted by fusing the features of all the rdbs and the final dense feature fdf is obtained by superimposing the shallow features f 1 and fgf finally the output result of the network is obtained by convolution again zhang et al 2018 the consistency of the structure is constrained by calculating the loss function with the original sm value the calculation of the loss function is shown in eq 3 3 l θ 1 2 n i 1 n mask s m smap i t y i m a s k ξ t y i 2 2 where n represents the number of sample pairs θ is the network parameter mask is the mask calculated based on the smap imagery ξ represents the training resnet ty represents the input data and smsmap represents the smap sm data the codes of three methods dbn nc dbn and resnet are available at https github com whu sgg rs pro group downscaling sm 3 3 residual correction in the process of downscaling sm products low resolution images need to be used to calibrate the downscaling results to further maintain the consistency with the spatial distribution of the original imagery this process is called residual correction and has been used successfully in some studies of downscaling including area to point regression kriging atprk based spatio spectral fusion wang et al 2015 and fit fc based spatio temporal fusion wang and atkinson 2018 the specific steps are as follows firstly the low resolution auxiliary factors are input into the trained downscaling model to obtain the estimated low resolution sm product smc secondly smc and the corresponding grid value smr in the original smap sm product are used to calculate the coarse scale residual and then the fine scale residual rf is obtained through bicubic interpolation this process is shown in the formula r f f bicubic s m r s m c where fbicubic represents the bicubic interpolation function finally the high resolution auxiliary factors are input into the model to obtain the high resolution sm data smf and rf is used to correct smf to obtain the final high resolution sm product smd this process is shown in the formula s m d s m f r f 3 4 evaluation methods 3 4 1 evaluation of the downscaling results with in situ soil moisture for the comparison and analysis the data first needed to be unified to the same temporal resolution because the data from the in situ sm measurements are at an hourly scale whereas the smap microwave sm product is at a daily scale a daily average operation was performed on the obtained ascending and descending orbit data as well as the hourly data of each observation station in this manner the satellite data and site data were unified into the same time scale for evaluation for the site data all the measurement sites are discretely distributed fig a 4 shows that the sm values within 1 km of the sites were averaged to represent the true value within 1 km and then the site data were matched with the sm data after downscaling according to the latitude and longitude four classical statistical indices were used to evaluate the downscaling results entekhabi et al 2010a entekhabi et al 2010b the pearson product moment correlation coefficient r unitless the root mean square error rmse cm3 cm3 the bias cm3 cm3 and the unbiased root mean square error ubrmse cm3 cm3 for the specific calculation formulas please refer to appendix a 4 3 4 2 three cornered hat method due to the limited number of sm sites in the tibetan plateau it is difficult to evaluate the overall performance of downscaling results in the study area in the absence of reference datasets the three cornered hat tch method tavella and premoli 1994 can be used to evaluate the relative uncertainty among three or more groups of different products this method has been used to evaluate the uncertainty of various rainfall data products awange et al 2016 grace time varying gravity field products ferreira et al 2016 and sm products qu et al 2021 in this study we used this method to analyze the uncertainty of the time series for the downscaled products of the five methods for a detailed introduction to the tch method and the formula calculation please refer to appendix a 5 4 results and analysis 4 1 evaluation of the downscaled results with in situ measurements to make a comprehensive assessment of the three proposed dl based downscaling models for sm products two classical regression analysis methods namely rf based on a decision tree and bpnn based on a neural network were selected for comparison the input data and label data for the rf and bpnn models were the same as for the dbn model and the point to point method was used for the model training to assess the results of the sm downscaling further four sm monitoring sites in the tibetan plateau region namely the ctp smtmn maqu naqu and ngari monitoring networks were selected for evaluation the results of the rf and bpnn models were compared with the downscaled results of the three dl methods as shown in tables 3 6 as can be seen from tables 3 6 for all four monitoring networks both the bpnn and dbn models have lower bias than the rf model and the values of rmse and ubrmse for these two models are close to those of the rf model in addition the bias of the dbn downscaling result is smaller than that of the bpnn downscaling result the rmse is smaller and the r value is larger for the bias value the nc dbn model downscaling result has the smallest bias in the first three monitoring networks and the resnet model result has the smallest bias in the fourth monitoring network reaching 0 0003 cm3 cm3 according to the rmse and ubrmse values the resnet model obtains either the smallest or the second smallest value however for the naqu network table 5 shows that the nc dbn model achieves the best results the reason for this may be that several sites only have available measurements after august 2016 and the nc dbn model is more suitable for high value estimates for the r value the resnet model has the largest value among the four monitoring networks which shows that it has a higher correlation with regard to the performance in the four evaluation indicators the nc dbn model performs better than the dbn model in the first three monitoring networks however in the ngari network table 6 indicates that the rmse and ubrmse values of the nc dbn model are not as small as those of the dbn model this may be because the ngari monitoring network is located in the northwest of the plateau where the sm value is less than 0 035 cm3 cm3 compared with the dbn model the nc dbn model makes use of the neighborhood information of each pixel and gives a higher estimation for the parts with lower sm in order to evaluate the performance of each method in different seasons of the year we performed a seasonal comparison as shown in fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3 that the downscaling results of all the methods underestimate the sm in all four seasons compared to the observation station and the bias is the smallest in spring and the largest in autumn among the different methods the rf model has the largest bias in spring and winter the nc dbn model has the smallest bias in all the seasons followed by the resnet model the bias of the dbn and bpnn models is smaller than that of the rf model in spring and winter but is larger than that of the rf model in summer and autumn overall the resnet model achieves the best or second results in bias rmse and ubrmse and has the highest r value this shows that the resnet model can provide more accurate and stable estimates moreover the resnet model downscaling result shows the best overall performance in the evaluation against all four monitoring networks in the tibetan plateau 4 2 comparison of the downscaled results with the original smap soil moisture in order to better analyze the characteristics of the original smap coarse scale sm product we calculated the statistical indicators r ubrmse bias spatially firstly considering the inconsistency of the spatial scales we averaged the resolution of the downscaling results from 1 km to 36 km and arranged the pixels in a day by day time series for each location in the imagery the time series pixels of the downscaled result and those of the original smap imagery were then matched after the missing values were removed finally the bias r and ubrmse values were calculated qu et al 2021 in this way three statistical index values for each location were obtained the results are shown in fig 4 the first column of fig 4 shows that in the spatial distribution of the bias between the downscaled results and the original imagery according to the value of the bias all five methods show high bias in the southeastern region of the plateau compared with the other methods the nc dbn model performs the best especially in the central and northwestern plateau regions the second column of fig 4 shows that in terms of maintaining the correlation between the downscaling results and the original imagery compared with the rf and bpnn models the downscaled results of the dbn nc dbn and resnet models show a better performance in the central region of the tibetan plateau and a worse performance in the northwest and southwest regions of the plateau among the different methods the resnet model shows the best performance and the area with high r values accounts for a relatively high proportion the third column of fig 4 shows that the resnet model obtains the lowest value and shows the best performance in the ubrmse distribution of the downscaled results and original imagery in order to visually display the value range of the evaluation indicators a boxplot is provided in fig a 5 according to the bias the best performing method is the nc dbn model followed by the resnet dbn bpnn and rf models the results show that the sm values of the nc dbn model downscaling results are the closest to those of the original imagery in terms of the r values the best performing method is the resnet model which has an average r value of 0 8909 followed by the nc dbn dbn bpnn and rf models this indicates that the resnet model downscaling results are the most relevant to the original imagery according to the ubrmse values the best performing method is the resnet model with an average of 0 0135 cm3 cm3 followed by the nc dbn dbn bpnn and rf models which is consistent with the results of r this shows that the resnet model results have high precision overall the three proposed dl methods achieve the best results in all the indicators compared with the original sm imagery 4 3 spatial mapping of soil moisture before and after downscaling to compare the spatial changes of the sm before and after downscaling sm maps before and after downscaling were generated and are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 in the process of making the monthly average maps the mask of each sm image was first calculated to extract the missing values in the sm image each day the mask was then multiplied with the image to remove the missing value areas and the sm monthly average was finally calculated fig 5 and fig 6 are the comparison of the results for the average monthly sm in april and august in 2016 respectively fig 5 and fig 6 show that the overall spatial variation trend of the sm of the downscaled results of the proposed methods is the same as that of the original smap imagery and the resnet model downscaling results improve the spatial details of the original imagery in terms of the spatial distribution the sm over the tibetan plateau decreases from south to north showing the characteristics of being dry in the northwest and wet in the southeast the maximum sm is found in the southeastern part of the tibetan plateau which has more precipitation and vegetation due to the humid alpine climate secondly the places with higher sm values are distributed in the southern edge of the himalayas which is a valley where the elevation gradually decreases to the south this area belongs to the warm and humid subtropical climate zone where the southwest monsoon from the indian ocean brings a large amount of precipitation the sm is also higher in the southeastern part of the qilian mountains which are located on the windward slope of the himalayas the mountainous terrain of the windward slope leads to an increase in precipitation however in the northern qaidam basin and the alpine desert area of the kunlun mountains the climate is mainly characterized by drought and the sm values are relatively low to further compare the spatial details of the three proposed downscaling methods two small regions in the northwest and southeast of the tibetan plateau in august 2016 were selected their locations in the research area are shown in fig 6 a and their detailed sm distribution maps are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 compared with the rf model results the downscaled results of the three proposed dl methods and the bpnn method have more textural details and can better show the changes of sm the downscaled results of the bpnn and dbn models are relatively similar whereas the downscaled results of the resnet model reflect the change of sm more accurately with more detailed features which are in accordance with the change of the surface information the dems for the two small regions are shown in fig 7 f and fig 8 f from fig 7 it is apparent that the original smap imagery does not show the local sm changes whereas the downscaled results of the three methods capture more information and are consistent with the textural details of the dem changes as shown by the solid line frame in fig 7 in the higher elevation area the downscaled results of all the methods show relatively low sm values which reveal the characteristics of reduced precipitation and drought in this area the results of the dbn and nc dbn models are overestimated in the regions with low sm values which may be because each pixel of the sm product is related to the neighborhood information of the corresponding pixel in the auxiliary surface parameter when the dbn and nc dbn models are trained all the pixels in the image are used as input without selectivity however the resnet model only uses the pixels with more relevant information in the 3 3 convolution kernel when training the model fig 8 shows that in the southeastern region of the tibetan plateau in august 2016 the original smap imagery does not show several low sm values and the change trend of the sm is not apparent however the downscaled results of the three proposed dl methods show that the sm in this region gradually decreases from northwest to southeast which is consistent with the phenomenon of the terrain in this region gradually becoming steeper the results also reveal that the summer monsoon in south asia in august 2016 brought more precipitation to the low lying areas in this region resulting in humid conditions 4 4 analysis of the temporal variation trend of the soil moisture before and after downscaling the above results show that the resnet model reduces the deviation and improves the accuracy while maintaining good correlation with the original smap imagery in the monthly average mapping results the downscaled results of the resnet model contain more detailed information which can more accurately reflect the changes in sm therefore in the analysis of the temporal variation trend of the results before and after downscaling only the resnet model downscaling results were compared with the original smap imagery the monthly average sm values for the original smap imagery and the resnet model downscaled results in the study area as well as the increment and growth rates were calculated and are listed in table 7 where a positive value indicates an increase and a negative value indicates a decrease to compare the changes of sm more intuitively a bar chart and a line chart are provided in fig a 6 table 7 and fig a 6 show that the downscaled results of the resnet model are consistent with the change trend of the original smap imagery but the overall sm value is higher than that of the original imagery specifically the difference of growth rate has the smallest difference with 0 3235 from january to february and the largest difference with 14 0672 appears from april to may this may be because the original low resolution smap imagery is not beneficial to describing possible areas with higher sm values whereas the resnet model can capture more spatial details to predict the sm values in these areas more accurately the bias of the resnet model result and the original imagery in fig 5 also shows that the regions where the sm values of the resnet model are higher than those of the original smap imagery occupy most of the plateau moreover the previous accuracy evaluation confirmed that the downscaled results of the resnet model are reasonable hence the phenomenon of the higher monthly mean values in the downscaled results of the resnet model can be considered reasonable to some extent 5 discussion 5 1 scale effect performance of the different algorithms the scale effect usually refers to the same downscaling model obtaining different scale features and processing results for data at different scales in the same area hence combining the results described in section 4 1 and section 4 2 we investigated the scale effect performance of the different algorithms and analyzed the feasibility of the downscaling algorithms established between sm and auxiliary surface parameters at the 36 km scale being applicable to the 1 km scale generally speaking the use of scale consistency assumptions can introduce uncertainty peng et al 2017 in order to eliminate such uncertainty residual correction is often used in the downscaling of lst precipitation and sm products alexakis and tsanis 2016 jiang et al 2017 maeda 2014 therefore in this study we also used the residual correction method to enhance the robustness of the models and reduce the estimation error due to the differences in the structure and degree of the nonlinearity of the different models scale effects can have different effects on the downscaling results of different downscaling models the results described in section 4 2 showed that the order of performance is resnet nc dbn dbn bpnn rf according to table 3 and table 6 the rf model downscaling result has higher correlation in some site networks than the results of the bpnn and dbn models but fig 4 and fig a 5 show that the rf model shows the worst performance in maintaining the details of the original coarse scale sm imagey compared with the point to point training model the resnet model can better fit the nonlinear relationships by considering the spatial neighborhood information therefore it can be seen from fig 4 and fig a 5 that the resnet model obtains the lowest ubrmse value and the highest r value in the calculation of the statistical indicators with the original imagery this phenomenon illustrates that the fitting relationship established by the resnet model at the 36 km scale has the closest applicability to the 1 km scale in conclusion combining the results described in section 4 1 and section 4 2 the resnet model not only obtains the highest accuracy and correlation in the evaluation with in situ measurements but it also shows the ability to maintain the overall performance of the original imagery with the smallest scale effect 5 2 temporal stability performance of different downscaling methods in order to further compare the temporal performance of the downscaled results obtained by all the methods for the different site networks we calculated monthly bias statistics for each independent site and all four sites fig 9 a shows the comprehensive statistical results for the four site networks the bias is the smallest in march and the largest in october for the ctp smtmn network fig 9 b shows that the bias values are all negative this indicates that the downscaling results of all the methods are underestimated throughout the year compared with the sm of the observation station moreover the bias shows an increasing trend with the smallest value in january and the largest in december for the maqu site network fig 9 c shows that the bias first increases and then decreases with the smallest value in january and the largest in august for the naqu site network fig 9 d shows that the variation trend of the bias is similar to that in fig 9 e the possible reason for this is that the location of this site network is close to that of the ctp smtmn site network with little difference in geographical environment on the whole the bias of the later months is larger than that of the previous months for all four site networks this may be due to the influence of factors such as snow leading to more missing smap images in these months so that the fitting effect in these months is poor in the future some other samples for these months can be used to fill in the missing values of the time series for better model fitting in addition fig 9 e shows that the downscaling results of all the methods in december are overestimated for the ngari network but underestimated for the other three site networks the possible reason for this is that the ngari network is located in a cold and arid area of the western tibetan plateau which is mainly alpine meadow due to the topographic and climatic conditions the original smap image values detected by the microwave radiometer were higher than those measured by the observation station in this month in conclusion the evaluation results for the four site networks over the tibetan plateau show that the results of the nc dbn model perform the best from the perspective of bias but the results of the resnet model show the best performance from the overall perspective of the four quantitative indicators to analyze the temporal variation with the original microwave product fig a 6 showed that the original sm product and the downscaling result have a downward trend from january to march with the lowest values in march the average value of the resnet model downscaled results for march is 0 1193 cm3 cm3 in table 7 which may be because most of the plateau is affected by seasonal freezing sm shows an upward trend from april to august and reaches a maximum value in august the average value of the resnet model downscaled results for august is 0 2468 cm3 cm3 the high sm in august is due to the melting of snow on the plateau which starts in april and the arrival of the monsoon from south asia along the brahmaputra river in the southeastern part of the plateau as well as the increased rainfall due to the onset of the monsoon season the sm shows a downward trend from august to december which is likely because the monsoon withdraws from the tibetan plateau the temperature drops and the plateau area begins to freeze in november the soil enters the freezing period and the sm is further reduced but the decline is not substantial 5 3 evaluation of the uncertainty of the downscaling results taking into account the discreteness of the in situ sm measurements and the influence of the number of sites in some regions the overall performance evaluation of downscaling methods is limited in plateau areas therefore in this study we used the tch method to evaluate the uncertainty of the five downscaling methods and to compare the spatial distribution of the uncertainty it can be seen from fig 10 that the five downscaling methods have higher uncertainty in the northwestern plateau and the edges of the himalayas and kunlun mountains when combined with the original sm imagery it can be found that these areas are the places where the pixel values of the sm imagery show abrupt changes this may be due to the transition from vegetation to desert in these areas where the topographic structure is complex and changeable combining the results of the analysis of the statistical indicators in section 4 2 it can also be seen that in the southern edge of the plateau where the terrain fluctuates greatly the downscaled imagery differs significantly from the original imagery with low accuracy and poor correlation however there is no site monitoring network in these areas which limits the study of sm in the areas with abrupt terrain a solution to this would be to establish more sm monitoring stations in relatively flat places with lower altitudes to more accurately capture the dynamics of sm compared with the rf and bpnn models the downscaling results of the nc dbn and resnet models have lower uncertainty in the central and southern regions of the plateau the nc dbn and resnet models show a similar uncertainty distribution and have lower uncertainty in most areas of the plateau especially in the central and eastern regions of the plateau the last graph of fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of the minimum uncertainty of the downscaling results among the different methods the resnet model has the highest proportion of minimum uncertainty distribution 36 14 followed by the nc dbn 29 57 dbn 16 48 bpnn 13 83 and rf 3 98 models overall the resnet model performs the best in the uncertainty assessment one reason for this result is that the point to point fitting method is easily affected by the deviation points which differ greatly from the real values if there is a deviation point in an input variable it is difficult to correct without considering the neighborhood resulting in the error being amplified during the overall modeling process when the resnet model uses a convolution operation the neighborhood information and spatial structure of multiple points can be combined to reduce this error thereby providing a more stable model structure on the other hand a certain pixel value of sm imagery has a certain correlation with the neighboring pixels and the nc dbn and resnet models take advantage of this correlation to reduce the uncertainty 6 conclusions and future work in this paper three dl models dbn nc dbn and resnet have been proposed for the downscaling of sm products the dbn model is based on a fully connected structure and uses the point to point method to train the model by constructing 3d cofactor blocks the nc dbn model considers the influence of the spatial correlation of the auxiliary surface parameters on sm in the resnet model the longitude and latitude are taken as 2d image matrices and rdbs are used to train the model based on the planar data such that the spatial structure integrity is better maintained the three proposed models all successfully reduced the scale of the smap passive microwave sm product from 36 km to 1 km in the tibetan plateau region for 2016 and were compared with the traditional rf and bpnn methods the comparison of the results with data from four sm monitoring networks showed that the dbn model performed better than the bpnn model in overall performance compared with the rf model the nc dbn model can greatly reduce the deviation and the resnet model can not only reduce the deviation but it can also improve the accuracy and maintain the correlation with the original smap sm product well the statistical comparison between the original sm product and the downscaled products showed that the nc dbn model obtained the lowest bias while the resnet model showed a better performance in correlation and accuracy the tch comparison results showed that the resnet model had the lowest uncertainty the monthly average sm before and after the downscaling was also calculated the results showed that the downscaling results of the three proposed models maintained good spatial consistency with the original sm product the dbn and bpnn models obtained similar visual effects while the nc dbn model showed an overestimation phenomenon in the areas with low sm however the downscaling results of the resnet model contained more detailed information which can more truly reflect the changes of sm moreover the downscaling results of the resnet model were consistent with the temporal variation trend of the sm in the original sm product compared with the traditional point to point training machine learning algorithms dl in general represents a promising way to build better nonlinear relationships between sm and auxiliary surface parameters some insights into the improvement will be provided in our future work firstly the application of dl to downscale the sm products of other satellites such as amsr2 and smos will be considered secondly the relationship between sm and other auxiliary surface parameters will be explored and more parameters will be used to fit the relationship with sm such as the land cover type soil texture data surface roughness and vegetation structure the linkage effect of atmospheric change human activities and other phenomena on sm distribution will also be explored credit authorship

sm over a short period of time in this study the selected data for the whole year were used to calculate r the bias and rmse can reflect the accuracy of the sm downscaling results whereas ubrmse can describe the true difference of different data levels by correcting the deviation of the data the r rmse bias and ubrmse values before and after the downscaling were calculated to verify the correlation between the downscaling results and the in situ sm measurements a 5 the three cornered hat method we consider the time series pi i 1 2 n of the five downscaling sm products where these

smap soil moisture a 7 analysis of the temporal variation trend of the soil moisture before and after downscaling 
3610,soil moisture sm is a very important physical parameter in land surface processes the low resolution microwave products are extremely useful for large scale studies but are limited in their ability to resolve landscape level variability in this study to overcome this limitation we adopted three different deep learning based downscaling methods and performed a comparative analysis firstly a downscaling method based on a deep belief network dbn model with a fully connected structure was employed to fit the complex nonlinear relationship between soil moisture and the auxiliary surface parameters then to improve this simple point to point relationship a neighborhood constraint based improved dbn model was developed to consider the effect of local spatial correlation among the surface factors on soil moisture finally to maintain the integrity of the spatial structure in the process of model construction a residual network resnet model consisting of several residual dense blocks rdbs was introduced to use convolutions to obtain more complete and powerful spatial feature maps the tibetan plateau was selected as the study area because of its importance to the global water cycle the four soil moisture monitoring networks in the research area were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods in the downscaling of soil moisture products and four quantitative indicators were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the methods from the verified results it is shown that the three deep learning methods can maintain a higher correlation and better reduce the bias on the whole and the resnet model in particular shows a higher stability from the perspective of the spatial patterns and details when compared to back propagation neural network bpnn and random forest rf models the three deep learning methods can provide more feasible spatial patterns and details as well as reducing the uncertainty in the central regions of the tibetan plateau the resnet model shows a superior ability to enhance the texture details with lower uncertainty due to the fact that it can meet the requirements of fitting the soil moisture to complex surfaces furthermore the results of the resnet model can also effectively capture the temporal changes of the microwave soil moisture product well keywords soil moisture downscaling tibetan plateau deep learning multisource data 1 introduction soil moisture sm is an important climate variable which usually refers to the amount of water stored in the unsaturated soil zone it affects the coupling of temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration and plays a very important role in the global water cycle surface energy cycle drought assessment and ecological management seneviratne et al 2010 in situ observation can realize high precision measurement of sm in different shallow soil layers however within a site monitoring network the ground observation stations are often unevenly distributed and the number can be limited for example observations stations may be densely distributed in flat areas but sparsely distributed in high altitude steep slope areas in addition each observation station only represents the restricted point scale sm with which it is difficult to reflect the change of sm over an entire region murray et al 2011 paulik et al 2014 therefore the point measurements of sm are limited in spatial coverage which creates challenges for spatially continuous hydrologic monitoring robock et al 2000 owing to its characteristics of all day and all weather observation microwave remote sensing can detect sm at a depth of 5 cm in topsoil and can be used to achieve regional and even global long term large scale sm monitoring with minimal interference from vegetation and clouds engman and chauhan 1995 jackson and schmugge 1989 since the 1970s a series of active and passive remote sensing satellites and sensors have been launched to detect the changes of sm passive microwave sensors include the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr njoku et al 1980 the special sensor microwave imager ssm i de ridder 2003 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observation system kawanishi et al 2003 the fengyun 3 fy 3 meteorological satellite parinussa et al 2014 the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos satellite kerr et al 2001 and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 parinussa et al 2015 active microwave sensors include the advanced microwave instrument ami scatterometer bartalis et al 2007 and the c sar instrument on board the sentinel 1 satellite snoeij et al 2010 active and passive earth observation satellites include the soil moisture active passive smap satellite entekhabi et al 2010a entekhabi et al 2010b although active microwave detection can obtain relatively high resolution sm products the estimation accuracy is low due to the influence of surface roughness vegetation canopy structure and water content dubois et al 1995 passive microwave systems are suitable for large scale sm monitoring because they are less affected by vegetation and surface roughness and are more sensitive to sm than active microwave systems ulaby 1982 however due to the trade off in antenna size needed for a high resolution and the technical challenge of launching and operating a large antenna in space njoku and entekhabi 1996 sabaghy et al 2018 passive sm products are typically at a relatively low spatial resolution approximately 25 40 km which cannot meet fine scale application requirements higher resolution sm information at a resolution of several kilometers or even hundreds of meters is needed for crop growth models and water management applications fang et al 2018 to fill this gap downscaling the coarse scale sm products is necessary kerr et al 2007 peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2018 in recent years many methods have been developed to improve the spatial resolution of sm products obtained from satellite remote sensing one of the common downscaling methods is model based method which is divided into statistical models based on geostatistical properties kaheil et al 2008 and fractal scale properties of sm kim and barros 2002 and hydrological models such as land surface model ines et al 2013 and data assimilation sahoo et al 2013 although this method can capture the spatial sm pattern well its model parameters are difficult to obtain the second category of downscaling methods is active and passive microwave data fusion method which combines the characteristics of high spatial resolution data with the characteristics of high sensitivity to sm using this category of methods researchers have downscaled different kinds of microwave sm data such as smap data das et al 2014 and electronically scanned thinned array radiometer estar data bindlish and barros 2002 in order to obtain higher precision sm xiwu et al 2006 proposed a bayesian merging method and verified the results with the hydros observing system simulation experiment osse datasets however this category of downscaling method also faced with challenges such as the inconsistent observation time between the active and passive sensors the low radar revisit rate and the sensitivity of vegetation characteristics to radar backscattering wu et al 2014 compared with microwave remote sensing optical and thermal remote sensing systems have the advantage of being able to provide surface parameters with a higher spatial resolution therefore many studies have attempted to downscale microwave sm products based on optical thermal and microwave fusion methods by obtaining a downscaling factor from high resolution optical thermal data peng et al 2017 based on the land surface temperature lst vegetation index vi triangular feature space carlson et al 1994 zhan et al 2002 preliminarily proposed an empirical polynomial fitting downscaling method this was later developed into a downscaling method for the deep mining of spatial feature information by multifactor joint prediction chauhan et al 2003 djamai et al 2015 merlin et al 2010 nasta et al 2018 wang et al 2016 this method still presents challenges with swath width and the influence of clouds and vegetation in addition the assumption of a linear scaling relationship is not always satisfied wei et al 2019 owing to the advantage of machine learning in solving nonlinear problems srivastava et al 2013 evaluated the performance of artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm relevance vector machine rvm and generalized linear model glm methods in smos sm downscaling and showed that the ann algorithm can significantly improve the spatial resolution of smos satellite sm compared to svm rvm and glm the back propagation neural network bpnn as a classic machine learning algorithm has also been shown to be superior in sm downscaling compared with a regression algorithm jiang et al 2017 in addition some other classical machine learning methods are also widely used in downscaling microwave sm products to obtain higher resolution sm imagery such as gradient boosting decision tree gbdt wei et al 2019 random forest rf liu et al 2017 etc compared with the traditional shallow network architectures deep learning dl can learn semantic high level and deeper features lee et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 and has already been applied to estimate sm fang et al 2017 employed a long short term memory lstm model to robustly predict surface sm based on the atmospheric forcing time series and physiographic attributes then a convolutional neural network cnn model was employed to estimate sm through thermal infrared images and performed better than the typical deep neural network dnn sobayo et al 2018 however the application of dl to downscaling is still lacking especially for ignoring the spatial neighborhood relationships a cnn method is only utilized to obtain better downscaling results than the svm and rf algorithms xu et al 2021 however this method only uses the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and lst and ignores the influence of terrain on sm as a result the accuracy is significantly reduced when higher resolution sm data are generated due to the complex geographical environment of the tibetan plateau it is difficult for traditional methods to obtain high resolution and high precision downscaling results in this region to solve this problem our primary goal in this paper is to study novel dl based methods by considering spatial neighborhood relationship and the impact of terrain and achieve the product of high resolution and high accuracy sm data under large scale differences e g from 36 km to 1 km on tibetan plateau then we intend to comprehensively and systematically evaluate the dl based sm downscaling methods over a specific area by discussing the spatio temporal effects on the downscaling results and analyzing their scaling effect and uncertainty in this paper we obtained 1 km high accuracy smap sm products in 2016 and have made the following contributions 1 we apply deep belief network dbn to smap sm downscaling for the first time and proposed a neighborhood constraint based improved dbn nc dbn model by considering the spatial neighborhood relationship to obtain the downscaling results with smaller bias 2 to utilize the deep characteristics and spatial local relationships of images residual network resnet is applied to downscaling for the first time to obtain higher accuracy results compared to bpnn and rf 3 one classic and four dl based sm downscaling methods were comprehensively compared on spatial details and temporal trends dl based methods will provide more spatial details from downscaling predictors and capture the similar temporal variation combining scaling effect and uncertainty it can be observed that the method considering neighborhood relationship can obtain higher accuracy and more stable products the rest of this paper is organized as follows the study area and datasets are introduced in section 2 the adopted methods are described in section 3 the experimental results are compared and analyzed in section 4 the scale effect temporal stability and the uncertainty of the different methods are discussed in section 5 the contributions of this study and the future research prospects are summarized in section 6 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the tibetan plateau is the highest plateau in the world with an average altitude of 4500 m and an area of 2 5 million square kilometers as shown in fig 1 the tibetan plateau ranges from 25 81 n to 39 82 n and 68 02 e to 104 61 e the tibetan plateau is known as the water tower of asia as it has a very important influence on the asian monsoon global atmospheric circulation and climate change through the thermal and dynamic stress effects meng et al 2017 as an important hydrological parameter sm affects the surface atmosphere energy flux through evaporation and thus represents important feedback on regional precipitation and even the climate system huang and margulis 2013 neelin and lintner 2009 2 2 smap soil moisture product nasa s smap mission was launched on january 31 2015 the smap satellite uses an l band radiometer and l band radar to retrieve global surface sm 5 cm depth and achieves a global coverage every two to three days however on july 7 2015 the radar sensor of the smap satellite was damaged in this study the data of the smap l3 radiometer global daily 36 km equal area scalable earth ease grid soil moisture smap sm p product from the national snow and ice data center nsidc o neill et al 2018 were used table 1 shows that the data used in this study covered a timeframe of january 1 2016 to december 31 2016 366 days in total this level 3 l3 sm product provides a composite of daily estimates of the global land surface conditions retrieved by the smap passive microwave radiometer the smap l band sm data are resampled to a global cylindrical 36 km ease grid version 2 0 the descending and ascending half orbit passes of the smap satellite are at 6a m and 6p m local time respectively in this study we used both kinds of data i e ascending and descending orbit data 2 3 auxiliary modis data in this study the high resolution optical auxiliary data included ndvi lst and surface albedo data table 1 shows that the ndvi product selected for the experiment was the mod13a2 product which has a spatial and temporal resolution of 1 km 16 days the product selected for lst was mod11a2 which includes day lst day and night lst night data and has a spatial and temporal resolution of 1 km 8 days the product selected for the ndvi surface reflectance was mcd43a3 which has a spatial and temporal resolution of 500 m day these products covered a timeframe of january 1 to december 31 2016 all of the above data were obtained from nasa s level 1 and atmosphere archive and distribution system distributed active archive center 2 4 digital elevation model the digital elevation model dem data used in this study came from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm which was launched in 2002 to obtain digital elevation data of the earth s surface covering an area of more than 119 million square kilometers between 60 north and 56 south van zyl 2001 which represents more than 80 of the global land surface including the whole of china the dem data selected in this study covered the tibetan plateau with a spatial resolution of 90 m the dem data were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud xuezhi et al 2014 the downloaded srtm dem utm90m data are framing data so that mosaicing clipping and coordinate system conversion were needed 2 5 in situ soil moisture measurements the in situ observation results of the international soil moisture measurement network ismn were selected as the basis of the final accuracy evaluation the ismn is a centralized data hosting facility that provides global on site sm measurement data from operational networks the ismn uses soil volume moisture units to validate and improve satellite derived sm products dorigo et al 2011 according to the scope and time interval of the study area the ctp smtmn naqu maqu and ngari sm monitoring networks in the naqu maqu and ali regions of the tibetan plateau were selected yang et al 2013 su et al 2011 the field observation values of sm with a detection depth of 5 cm from the surface were selected a detailed description of the observation stations is provided in table 2 3 methodology the basic principle of the downscaling framework proposed in this paper is based on the assumption that the relationship between sm and the auxiliary surface parameters is scale invariant jiang et al 2017 that is the relationship established under low resolution condition can be applied to obtain high resolution sm by using high resolution cofactors the whole framework includes four parts data preprocessing model construction residual correction and result evaluation fig 2 shows the framework flow of the three sm downscaling methods used in this study firstly in the data preprocessing part the smap sm data and the auxiliary high resolution data were stitched clipped reprojected and resampled and the daily average of the site data was determined in this paper we use the nearest neighbor interpolation method to resample auxiliary data secondly in the part of model construction the relationship between sm and the auxiliary surface parameters was trained under the condition of a low resolution and the dl based sm downscaling model was obtained the auxiliary surface parameters were longitude latitude ndvi lst albedo and dem in the prediction the high resolution auxiliary surface parameters were input into the model to obtain a high resolution sm product thirdly in the residual correction low resolution images were used to calibrate the downscaling results to maintain the information of the original imagery finally in the evaluation part with the data from the four observation networks the site data and sm product were matched based on the longitude and latitude and four quantitative indicators were used to evaluate the accuracy precision and relevance of the downscaling results 3 1 data preprocessing the high resolution optical data were stitched cropped and reprojected and the unified coordinate system was the wgs 1984 geographic coordinate system the 0 5 cm depth data were selected from the site data for evaluation because the smap satellite s microwave sensor detects surface sm to ensure temporal consistency with the smap product the 24 h average as observed by the sites each day was adopted as the final evaluation basis the auxiliary data of longitude latitude ndvi lst albedo and dem were resampled to 1 and 36 km scales the auxiliary data with a resolution of 36 km and the coarse scale smap sm product were used to build the downscaling model the auxiliary data with a resolution of 1 km were used as the model input in the prediction stage many null values in the sm imagery of the smap satellite were noticed daily due to the influence of the satellite orbit scanning and topographic structure before the model training these null values and the auxiliary surface parameters corresponding to their grids were deleted and all the training data were normalized to 0 1 in the process of the model construction we divided all the data so that the training set accounted for 70 and the test set accounted for 30 for the different models the training set and test set were divided into the same proportions the smap ascending and descending orbit products were used for the model training the ascending orbit product corresponded to the surface temperature product at night whereas the descending orbit product corresponded to the surface temperature product during the day 3 2 deep learning methods for the downscaling of soil moisture 3 2 1 deep belief network as a classic dl model the dbn was proposed by hinton et al 2006 the dbn solved the training problem of the dnn and promoted the rapid development of dl it is a multilayer neural network structure with a good nonlinear fitting ability the dbn model was applied to the downscaling of the smap sm product as shown in fig a 1 in four steps firstly data pairs were extracted according to the longitude and latitude the longitude latitude ndvi lst albedo and dem data were used as inputs for the dbn network model and the smap sm product was used as the label data for the model secondly the missing values in the matched data pairs were removed the process of removing the missing values was to splice the vector of the input data and the vector of the label data into a 2d matrix according to the column the positions of the missing values in the matrix were detected row by row all the missing data in the whole row were eliminated and all the input data were normalized to 0 1 the label data did not need to be normalized because the distribution range of the smap sm product was between 0 and 1 thirdly the processed input data and label data were input into the dbn to train the model finally the high resolution auxiliary data were input into the trained model to obtain the high resolution sm product for the detailed process of the dbn algorithm please refer to appendix a 1 3 2 2 neighborhood constraint based improved deep belief network through point to point training the dbn model can fit the relationship between the sm and auxiliary surface parameters well but it does not consider the local geospatial characteristics of the auxiliary factors for sm products each pixel is affected by the neighborhood information of the auxiliary surface parameters to solve this problem a neighborhood constraint based improved dbn nc dbn model is proposed for each pixel its neighborhood information is extracted and a 3d cofactor block is constructed by combining this with the neighborhood information as shown in fig a 2 similar to the dbn downscaling model the nc dbn model uses the smap sm data as the label data to train the complex nonlinear model between the sm and auxiliary variables at a low resolution and then inputs auxiliary data with a high spatial resolution into the model for prediction neighborhood operations need to be employed on the low resolution data in the training and the high resolution data in the testing to maintain the consistency of the dimensions fig a 2 shows that to make full use of the edge information of the imagery an edge padding operation is first performed on the auxiliary factor the image size is expanded by copying the value in the outer boundary assuming that the spatial resolution of the auxiliary image is w h then the resolution after the edge padding operation becomes w 2 h 2 in this study a 3 3 matrix was used for the pixel by pixel scanning to obtain the information of the nine pixels in the neighborhood of each pixel and a w h 9 3d matrix was finally formed in this manner the amount of input data for the model was greatly increased from one pixel to nine pixels in its neighborhood the weight and bias items were fitted through the network structure of the dbn model neighborhood operations were conducted on the four variables of longitude latitude lst and ndvi which were then converted into 3d cofactor blocks although the spatial neighborhood information of the auxiliary surface parameters is considered in the nc dbn model the spatial structure is not constrained therefore dropout and l2 regularization were added into the model to restrict the smoothness of the structure the loss function and l2 regularization are shown in eq 1 1 l λ ω 1 2 n i 1 n y i f x i 2 2 λ ω 2 2 where lλ is the loss function ω is the weight n is the number of sample pairs in the training set y represents the original sm x represents six auxiliary variables f represents the established model and λ is the regular term coefficient van laarhoven 2017 3 2 3 resnet although the dbn model can fit the nonlinear relationship well it does not consider the neighborhood information the nc dbn model takes into account the neighborhood information of the auxiliary surface parameters but it cannot maintain the spatial integrity in the model training in dl convolution can realize feature extraction without changing the structure of the original imagery traore et al 2018 hence using a cnn to train the model was considered as a further development of the cnn the resnet model he et al 2016 has been used in target detection machine translation face recognition and other fields ling et al 2019 pham et al 2020 wang et al 2019 the resnet model can also reduce gradient explosion achieve deeper training and realize multiple utilization of shallow features through skip connections therefore a downscaling method incorporating a resnet model is proposed the longitude and latitude data were transformed into a 2d image matrix to train the resnet model the specific steps were as follows firstly the auxiliary images were stacked where the auxiliary images included longitude latitude ndvi lst albedo and dem images secondly the feature map was obtained by using the convolution kernel to scan pixel by pixel thirdly the mask of the original smap image data was calculated and mask processing of the feature map was carried out differing from traditional imagery the satellite imagery of sm often contains missing information due to the influence of orbit scanning and topography thus if the loss function between the feature image and the smap image is calculated directly then an error will occur in this study the strategy shown in fig a 3 a was adopted the sm mask was calculated based on the original smap image and then the mask was processed on the feature image to obtain the pseudo sm image finally the estimated sm product and the original smap product were used to calculate the loss function to carry out back propagation and optimize the model fig a 3 b shows the structure of the resnet architecture used in this study firstly the first convolutional layer extracts the shallow feature f 1 of the surface auxiliary parameters and then the second convolutional layer further extracts feature f0 as the input of the rdbs the purpose of the rdbs is to cascade features of different levels to enhance information flow transmission the calculation of the output fd of the d th rdb is shown in eq 2 2 f d h rdb d f d 1 h rdb d h rdb d 1 h rdb d f 0 where hrdb d is a compound function which represents the convolution and activation operation the selected activation function is the rectified linear unit relu function and the calculation of the last layer involves the use of the previous layer the relu is used to enhance the nonlinear characteristics of the imagery dense feature fusion including global feature fusion gff and global residual learning grl is then further performed gff involves the fusion of the features processed by the different rdb modules and grl involves introducing the features of the original surface parameters into the features processed by the rdb module the global feature fgf is extracted by fusing the features of all the rdbs and the final dense feature fdf is obtained by superimposing the shallow features f 1 and fgf finally the output result of the network is obtained by convolution again zhang et al 2018 the consistency of the structure is constrained by calculating the loss function with the original sm value the calculation of the loss function is shown in eq 3 3 l θ 1 2 n i 1 n mask s m smap i t y i m a s k ξ t y i 2 2 where n represents the number of sample pairs θ is the network parameter mask is the mask calculated based on the smap imagery ξ represents the training resnet ty represents the input data and smsmap represents the smap sm data the codes of three methods dbn nc dbn and resnet are available at https github com whu sgg rs pro group downscaling sm 3 3 residual correction in the process of downscaling sm products low resolution images need to be used to calibrate the downscaling results to further maintain the consistency with the spatial distribution of the original imagery this process is called residual correction and has been used successfully in some studies of downscaling including area to point regression kriging atprk based spatio spectral fusion wang et al 2015 and fit fc based spatio temporal fusion wang and atkinson 2018 the specific steps are as follows firstly the low resolution auxiliary factors are input into the trained downscaling model to obtain the estimated low resolution sm product smc secondly smc and the corresponding grid value smr in the original smap sm product are used to calculate the coarse scale residual and then the fine scale residual rf is obtained through bicubic interpolation this process is shown in the formula r f f bicubic s m r s m c where fbicubic represents the bicubic interpolation function finally the high resolution auxiliary factors are input into the model to obtain the high resolution sm data smf and rf is used to correct smf to obtain the final high resolution sm product smd this process is shown in the formula s m d s m f r f 3 4 evaluation methods 3 4 1 evaluation of the downscaling results with in situ soil moisture for the comparison and analysis the data first needed to be unified to the same temporal resolution because the data from the in situ sm measurements are at an hourly scale whereas the smap microwave sm product is at a daily scale a daily average operation was performed on the obtained ascending and descending orbit data as well as the hourly data of each observation station in this manner the satellite data and site data were unified into the same time scale for evaluation for the site data all the measurement sites are discretely distributed fig a 4 shows that the sm values within 1 km of the sites were averaged to represent the true value within 1 km and then the site data were matched with the sm data after downscaling according to the latitude and longitude four classical statistical indices were used to evaluate the downscaling results entekhabi et al 2010a entekhabi et al 2010b the pearson product moment correlation coefficient r unitless the root mean square error rmse cm3 cm3 the bias cm3 cm3 and the unbiased root mean square error ubrmse cm3 cm3 for the specific calculation formulas please refer to appendix a 4 3 4 2 three cornered hat method due to the limited number of sm sites in the tibetan plateau it is difficult to evaluate the overall performance of downscaling results in the study area in the absence of reference datasets the three cornered hat tch method tavella and premoli 1994 can be used to evaluate the relative uncertainty among three or more groups of different products this method has been used to evaluate the uncertainty of various rainfall data products awange et al 2016 grace time varying gravity field products ferreira et al 2016 and sm products qu et al 2021 in this study we used this method to analyze the uncertainty of the time series for the downscaled products of the five methods for a detailed introduction to the tch method and the formula calculation please refer to appendix a 5 4 results and analysis 4 1 evaluation of the downscaled results with in situ measurements to make a comprehensive assessment of the three proposed dl based downscaling models for sm products two classical regression analysis methods namely rf based on a decision tree and bpnn based on a neural network were selected for comparison the input data and label data for the rf and bpnn models were the same as for the dbn model and the point to point method was used for the model training to assess the results of the sm downscaling further four sm monitoring sites in the tibetan plateau region namely the ctp smtmn maqu naqu and ngari monitoring networks were selected for evaluation the results of the rf and bpnn models were compared with the downscaled results of the three dl methods as shown in tables 3 6 as can be seen from tables 3 6 for all four monitoring networks both the bpnn and dbn models have lower bias than the rf model and the values of rmse and ubrmse for these two models are close to those of the rf model in addition the bias of the dbn downscaling result is smaller than that of the bpnn downscaling result the rmse is smaller and the r value is larger for the bias value the nc dbn model downscaling result has the smallest bias in the first three monitoring networks and the resnet model result has the smallest bias in the fourth monitoring network reaching 0 0003 cm3 cm3 according to the rmse and ubrmse values the resnet model obtains either the smallest or the second smallest value however for the naqu network table 5 shows that the nc dbn model achieves the best results the reason for this may be that several sites only have available measurements after august 2016 and the nc dbn model is more suitable for high value estimates for the r value the resnet model has the largest value among the four monitoring networks which shows that it has a higher correlation with regard to the performance in the four evaluation indicators the nc dbn model performs better than the dbn model in the first three monitoring networks however in the ngari network table 6 indicates that the rmse and ubrmse values of the nc dbn model are not as small as those of the dbn model this may be because the ngari monitoring network is located in the northwest of the plateau where the sm value is less than 0 035 cm3 cm3 compared with the dbn model the nc dbn model makes use of the neighborhood information of each pixel and gives a higher estimation for the parts with lower sm in order to evaluate the performance of each method in different seasons of the year we performed a seasonal comparison as shown in fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3 that the downscaling results of all the methods underestimate the sm in all four seasons compared to the observation station and the bias is the smallest in spring and the largest in autumn among the different methods the rf model has the largest bias in spring and winter the nc dbn model has the smallest bias in all the seasons followed by the resnet model the bias of the dbn and bpnn models is smaller than that of the rf model in spring and winter but is larger than that of the rf model in summer and autumn overall the resnet model achieves the best or second results in bias rmse and ubrmse and has the highest r value this shows that the resnet model can provide more accurate and stable estimates moreover the resnet model downscaling result shows the best overall performance in the evaluation against all four monitoring networks in the tibetan plateau 4 2 comparison of the downscaled results with the original smap soil moisture in order to better analyze the characteristics of the original smap coarse scale sm product we calculated the statistical indicators r ubrmse bias spatially firstly considering the inconsistency of the spatial scales we averaged the resolution of the downscaling results from 1 km to 36 km and arranged the pixels in a day by day time series for each location in the imagery the time series pixels of the downscaled result and those of the original smap imagery were then matched after the missing values were removed finally the bias r and ubrmse values were calculated qu et al 2021 in this way three statistical index values for each location were obtained the results are shown in fig 4 the first column of fig 4 shows that in the spatial distribution of the bias between the downscaled results and the original imagery according to the value of the bias all five methods show high bias in the southeastern region of the plateau compared with the other methods the nc dbn model performs the best especially in the central and northwestern plateau regions the second column of fig 4 shows that in terms of maintaining the correlation between the downscaling results and the original imagery compared with the rf and bpnn models the downscaled results of the dbn nc dbn and resnet models show a better performance in the central region of the tibetan plateau and a worse performance in the northwest and southwest regions of the plateau among the different methods the resnet model shows the best performance and the area with high r values accounts for a relatively high proportion the third column of fig 4 shows that the resnet model obtains the lowest value and shows the best performance in the ubrmse distribution of the downscaled results and original imagery in order to visually display the value range of the evaluation indicators a boxplot is provided in fig a 5 according to the bias the best performing method is the nc dbn model followed by the resnet dbn bpnn and rf models the results show that the sm values of the nc dbn model downscaling results are the closest to those of the original imagery in terms of the r values the best performing method is the resnet model which has an average r value of 0 8909 followed by the nc dbn dbn bpnn and rf models this indicates that the resnet model downscaling results are the most relevant to the original imagery according to the ubrmse values the best performing method is the resnet model with an average of 0 0135 cm3 cm3 followed by the nc dbn dbn bpnn and rf models which is consistent with the results of r this shows that the resnet model results have high precision overall the three proposed dl methods achieve the best results in all the indicators compared with the original sm imagery 4 3 spatial mapping of soil moisture before and after downscaling to compare the spatial changes of the sm before and after downscaling sm maps before and after downscaling were generated and are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 in the process of making the monthly average maps the mask of each sm image was first calculated to extract the missing values in the sm image each day the mask was then multiplied with the image to remove the missing value areas and the sm monthly average was finally calculated fig 5 and fig 6 are the comparison of the results for the average monthly sm in april and august in 2016 respectively fig 5 and fig 6 show that the overall spatial variation trend of the sm of the downscaled results of the proposed methods is the same as that of the original smap imagery and the resnet model downscaling results improve the spatial details of the original imagery in terms of the spatial distribution the sm over the tibetan plateau decreases from south to north showing the characteristics of being dry in the northwest and wet in the southeast the maximum sm is found in the southeastern part of the tibetan plateau which has more precipitation and vegetation due to the humid alpine climate secondly the places with higher sm values are distributed in the southern edge of the himalayas which is a valley where the elevation gradually decreases to the south this area belongs to the warm and humid subtropical climate zone where the southwest monsoon from the indian ocean brings a large amount of precipitation the sm is also higher in the southeastern part of the qilian mountains which are located on the windward slope of the himalayas the mountainous terrain of the windward slope leads to an increase in precipitation however in the northern qaidam basin and the alpine desert area of the kunlun mountains the climate is mainly characterized by drought and the sm values are relatively low to further compare the spatial details of the three proposed downscaling methods two small regions in the northwest and southeast of the tibetan plateau in august 2016 were selected their locations in the research area are shown in fig 6 a and their detailed sm distribution maps are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 compared with the rf model results the downscaled results of the three proposed dl methods and the bpnn method have more textural details and can better show the changes of sm the downscaled results of the bpnn and dbn models are relatively similar whereas the downscaled results of the resnet model reflect the change of sm more accurately with more detailed features which are in accordance with the change of the surface information the dems for the two small regions are shown in fig 7 f and fig 8 f from fig 7 it is apparent that the original smap imagery does not show the local sm changes whereas the downscaled results of the three methods capture more information and are consistent with the textural details of the dem changes as shown by the solid line frame in fig 7 in the higher elevation area the downscaled results of all the methods show relatively low sm values which reveal the characteristics of reduced precipitation and drought in this area the results of the dbn and nc dbn models are overestimated in the regions with low sm values which may be because each pixel of the sm product is related to the neighborhood information of the corresponding pixel in the auxiliary surface parameter when the dbn and nc dbn models are trained all the pixels in the image are used as input without selectivity however the resnet model only uses the pixels with more relevant information in the 3 3 convolution kernel when training the model fig 8 shows that in the southeastern region of the tibetan plateau in august 2016 the original smap imagery does not show several low sm values and the change trend of the sm is not apparent however the downscaled results of the three proposed dl methods show that the sm in this region gradually decreases from northwest to southeast which is consistent with the phenomenon of the terrain in this region gradually becoming steeper the results also reveal that the summer monsoon in south asia in august 2016 brought more precipitation to the low lying areas in this region resulting in humid conditions 4 4 analysis of the temporal variation trend of the soil moisture before and after downscaling the above results show that the resnet model reduces the deviation and improves the accuracy while maintaining good correlation with the original smap imagery in the monthly average mapping results the downscaled results of the resnet model contain more detailed information which can more accurately reflect the changes in sm therefore in the analysis of the temporal variation trend of the results before and after downscaling only the resnet model downscaling results were compared with the original smap imagery the monthly average sm values for the original smap imagery and the resnet model downscaled results in the study area as well as the increment and growth rates were calculated and are listed in table 7 where a positive value indicates an increase and a negative value indicates a decrease to compare the changes of sm more intuitively a bar chart and a line chart are provided in fig a 6 table 7 and fig a 6 show that the downscaled results of the resnet model are consistent with the change trend of the original smap imagery but the overall sm value is higher than that of the original imagery specifically the difference of growth rate has the smallest difference with 0 3235 from january to february and the largest difference with 14 0672 appears from april to may this may be because the original low resolution smap imagery is not beneficial to describing possible areas with higher sm values whereas the resnet model can capture more spatial details to predict the sm values in these areas more accurately the bias of the resnet model result and the original imagery in fig 5 also shows that the regions where the sm values of the resnet model are higher than those of the original smap imagery occupy most of the plateau moreover the previous accuracy evaluation confirmed that the downscaled results of the resnet model are reasonable hence the phenomenon of the higher monthly mean values in the downscaled results of the resnet model can be considered reasonable to some extent 5 discussion 5 1 scale effect performance of the different algorithms the scale effect usually refers to the same downscaling model obtaining different scale features and processing results for data at different scales in the same area hence combining the results described in section 4 1 and section 4 2 we investigated the scale effect performance of the different algorithms and analyzed the feasibility of the downscaling algorithms established between sm and auxiliary surface parameters at the 36 km scale being applicable to the 1 km scale generally speaking the use of scale consistency assumptions can introduce uncertainty peng et al 2017 in order to eliminate such uncertainty residual correction is often used in the downscaling of lst precipitation and sm products alexakis and tsanis 2016 jiang et al 2017 maeda 2014 therefore in this study we also used the residual correction method to enhance the robustness of the models and reduce the estimation error due to the differences in the structure and degree of the nonlinearity of the different models scale effects can have different effects on the downscaling results of different downscaling models the results described in section 4 2 showed that the order of performance is resnet nc dbn dbn bpnn rf according to table 3 and table 6 the rf model downscaling result has higher correlation in some site networks than the results of the bpnn and dbn models but fig 4 and fig a 5 show that the rf model shows the worst performance in maintaining the details of the original coarse scale sm imagey compared with the point to point training model the resnet model can better fit the nonlinear relationships by considering the spatial neighborhood information therefore it can be seen from fig 4 and fig a 5 that the resnet model obtains the lowest ubrmse value and the highest r value in the calculation of the statistical indicators with the original imagery this phenomenon illustrates that the fitting relationship established by the resnet model at the 36 km scale has the closest applicability to the 1 km scale in conclusion combining the results described in section 4 1 and section 4 2 the resnet model not only obtains the highest accuracy and correlation in the evaluation with in situ measurements but it also shows the ability to maintain the overall performance of the original imagery with the smallest scale effect 5 2 temporal stability performance of different downscaling methods in order to further compare the temporal performance of the downscaled results obtained by all the methods for the different site networks we calculated monthly bias statistics for each independent site and all four sites fig 9 a shows the comprehensive statistical results for the four site networks the bias is the smallest in march and the largest in october for the ctp smtmn network fig 9 b shows that the bias values are all negative this indicates that the downscaling results of all the methods are underestimated throughout the year compared with the sm of the observation station moreover the bias shows an increasing trend with the smallest value in january and the largest in december for the maqu site network fig 9 c shows that the bias first increases and then decreases with the smallest value in january and the largest in august for the naqu site network fig 9 d shows that the variation trend of the bias is similar to that in fig 9 e the possible reason for this is that the location of this site network is close to that of the ctp smtmn site network with little difference in geographical environment on the whole the bias of the later months is larger than that of the previous months for all four site networks this may be due to the influence of factors such as snow leading to more missing smap images in these months so that the fitting effect in these months is poor in the future some other samples for these months can be used to fill in the missing values of the time series for better model fitting in addition fig 9 e shows that the downscaling results of all the methods in december are overestimated for the ngari network but underestimated for the other three site networks the possible reason for this is that the ngari network is located in a cold and arid area of the western tibetan plateau which is mainly alpine meadow due to the topographic and climatic conditions the original smap image values detected by the microwave radiometer were higher than those measured by the observation station in this month in conclusion the evaluation results for the four site networks over the tibetan plateau show that the results of the nc dbn model perform the best from the perspective of bias but the results of the resnet model show the best performance from the overall perspective of the four quantitative indicators to analyze the temporal variation with the original microwave product fig a 6 showed that the original sm product and the downscaling result have a downward trend from january to march with the lowest values in march the average value of the resnet model downscaled results for march is 0 1193 cm3 cm3 in table 7 which may be because most of the plateau is affected by seasonal freezing sm shows an upward trend from april to august and reaches a maximum value in august the average value of the resnet model downscaled results for august is 0 2468 cm3 cm3 the high sm in august is due to the melting of snow on the plateau which starts in april and the arrival of the monsoon from south asia along the brahmaputra river in the southeastern part of the plateau as well as the increased rainfall due to the onset of the monsoon season the sm shows a downward trend from august to december which is likely because the monsoon withdraws from the tibetan plateau the temperature drops and the plateau area begins to freeze in november the soil enters the freezing period and the sm is further reduced but the decline is not substantial 5 3 evaluation of the uncertainty of the downscaling results taking into account the discreteness of the in situ sm measurements and the influence of the number of sites in some regions the overall performance evaluation of downscaling methods is limited in plateau areas therefore in this study we used the tch method to evaluate the uncertainty of the five downscaling methods and to compare the spatial distribution of the uncertainty it can be seen from fig 10 that the five downscaling methods have higher uncertainty in the northwestern plateau and the edges of the himalayas and kunlun mountains when combined with the original sm imagery it can be found that these areas are the places where the pixel values of the sm imagery show abrupt changes this may be due to the transition from vegetation to desert in these areas where the topographic structure is complex and changeable combining the results of the analysis of the statistical indicators in section 4 2 it can also be seen that in the southern edge of the plateau where the terrain fluctuates greatly the downscaled imagery differs significantly from the original imagery with low accuracy and poor correlation however there is no site monitoring network in these areas which limits the study of sm in the areas with abrupt terrain a solution to this would be to establish more sm monitoring stations in relatively flat places with lower altitudes to more accurately capture the dynamics of sm compared with the rf and bpnn models the downscaling results of the nc dbn and resnet models have lower uncertainty in the central and southern regions of the plateau the nc dbn and resnet models show a similar uncertainty distribution and have lower uncertainty in most areas of the plateau especially in the central and eastern regions of the plateau the last graph of fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of the minimum uncertainty of the downscaling results among the different methods the resnet model has the highest proportion of minimum uncertainty distribution 36 14 followed by the nc dbn 29 57 dbn 16 48 bpnn 13 83 and rf 3 98 models overall the resnet model performs the best in the uncertainty assessment one reason for this result is that the point to point fitting method is easily affected by the deviation points which differ greatly from the real values if there is a deviation point in an input variable it is difficult to correct without considering the neighborhood resulting in the error being amplified during the overall modeling process when the resnet model uses a convolution operation the neighborhood information and spatial structure of multiple points can be combined to reduce this error thereby providing a more stable model structure on the other hand a certain pixel value of sm imagery has a certain correlation with the neighboring pixels and the nc dbn and resnet models take advantage of this correlation to reduce the uncertainty 6 conclusions and future work in this paper three dl models dbn nc dbn and resnet have been proposed for the downscaling of sm products the dbn model is based on a fully connected structure and uses the point to point method to train the model by constructing 3d cofactor blocks the nc dbn model considers the influence of the spatial correlation of the auxiliary surface parameters on sm in the resnet model the longitude and latitude are taken as 2d image matrices and rdbs are used to train the model based on the planar data such that the spatial structure integrity is better maintained the three proposed models all successfully reduced the scale of the smap passive microwave sm product from 36 km to 1 km in the tibetan plateau region for 2016 and were compared with the traditional rf and bpnn methods the comparison of the results with data from four sm monitoring networks showed that the dbn model performed better than the bpnn model in overall performance compared with the rf model the nc dbn model can greatly reduce the deviation and the resnet model can not only reduce the deviation but it can also improve the accuracy and maintain the correlation with the original smap sm product well the statistical comparison between the original sm product and the downscaled products showed that the nc dbn model obtained the lowest bias while the resnet model showed a better performance in correlation and accuracy the tch comparison results showed that the resnet model had the lowest uncertainty the monthly average sm before and after the downscaling was also calculated the results showed that the downscaling results of the three proposed models maintained good spatial consistency with the original sm product the dbn and bpnn models obtained similar visual effects while the nc dbn model showed an overestimation phenomenon in the areas with low sm however the downscaling results of the resnet model contained more detailed information which can more truly reflect the changes of sm moreover the downscaling results of the resnet model were consistent with the temporal variation trend of the sm in the original sm product compared with the traditional point to point training machine learning algorithms dl in general represents a promising way to build better nonlinear relationships between sm and auxiliary surface parameters some insights into the improvement will be provided in our future work firstly the application of dl to downscale the sm products of other satellites such as amsr2 and smos will be considered secondly the relationship between sm and other auxiliary surface parameters will be explored and more parameters will be used to fit the relationship with sm such as the land cover type soil texture data surface roughness and vegetation structure the linkage effect of atmospheric change human activities and other phenomena on sm distribution will also be explored credit authorship

3611,iron fe oxyhydr oxides and organic matter om are important hosts of geogenic phosphorus p in groundwater systems however the coupled influence of fe oxyhydr oxides and om on the occurrence and mobility of p in groundwater remains unclear in this study we shed light on the underlying mechanisms of the control of fe oxyhydr oxides and om on p mobilization in the alluvial lacustrine aquifers at the dongting plain dtp central china using tracing techniques of isotopes δ 13c dic and δ 56fe characterization of dissolved organic matter dom and groundwater geochemistry the results suggest that high concentrations of geogenic p up to 3 58 mg l as total dissolved phosphorus tdp tend to occur in relatively reducing and sluggish hydrogeological environments experiencing longer time of water rock interactions and are closely related to the reductive dissolution of p rich fe iii oxyhydr oxides as well as the mineralization of organic p our observations suggest that two different processes between fe iii oxyhydr oxides and om contribute to the high concentrations of tdp in groundwater firstly under moderately reducing conditions labile om is oxidized with amorphous fe iii oxyhydr oxides acting as electron acceptors subsequently the adsorbed and or occluded p on into om or amorphous fe iii oxhydr oxides is concomitantly released into groundwater secondly under strongly reducing conditions the degradation of recalcitrant om depends on the concurrent roles of crystalline fe iii oxyhydr oxides as electron acceptors and conduits which further influence the mobility of p the latter p mobilizing redox processes were identified to prevail over the former in the groundwater of dtp this study provides new insights into the anomalous concentration of p in groundwater of alluvial lacustrine sandy aquifer systems keywords phosphorus iron organic matter groundwater stable isotope 1 introduction in recent decades increasing evidence has indicated that global phosphorus p pollution could be more serious in groundwater than previously predicted holman et al 2010 meinikmann et al 2015 liao et al 2019 tao et al 2020 the discharge of groundwater with high concentrations of p into surface waters strongly affects the trophic status of water bodies it may cause freshwater eutrophication and complicate freshwater restoration efforts zhang et al 2020 yu et al 2021 thus understanding the sources and mechanisms of p mobilization in aquifer systems is critical for effectively improving the global freshwater environment high concentrations p in groundwater often originate from anthropogenic sources such as agricultural production industrial activities mining activities etc meinikmann et al 2015 gerla and gbolo 2018 ančić et al 2020 different from them geogenic p in groundwater refer to that originate from the aquifer matrices and have been enriched under complex geological and hydrogeochemical conditions although there is a consensus that geogenic p is released from sediment hosted p into groundwater the roles of organic matter om and p rich minerals mainly p rich iron or calcareous minerals in p mobilization remain controversial nevertheless the following three mechanisms of the release of geogenic p have generally been accepted i solid om or aqueous phase om represent potential sources of p which can release p during microbially mediated mineralization kalbitz et al 2000 allison and vitousek 2005 ii biodegradable om can fuel microbial respiration leading to rapid depletion of dissolved terminal electron acceptors when redox conditions favorable for the reductive dissolution of iron fe oxyhydr oxides are reached adsorbed and or occluded p is simultaneously released into groundwater neidhardt et al 2018 warrinnier et al 2020 iii for other p rich minerals especially calcareous minerals such as apatite their rapid dissolution usually occurs in acidic groundwater environments so their contribution is low in neutral groundwater environments fulmer et al 2002 overall om and fe serve the most critical roles in geogenic p cycling in most of aquifer systems especially in alluvial lacustrine plains where om and fe oxyhydr oxides are abundant in aquifer sediments understanding the process of om degradation and further identifying the redox transformation pathway of fe iii oxyhydr oxides can help to improve our understanding of geogenic p mobilization stable carbon isotopes in dissolved inorganic carbon dic and fe isotopes are powerful tools for gaining insights into om degradation and fe biogeochemical cycling respectively although the mineralization of om containing p involves various complex biogeochemical reactions dic is continuously produced as a result and apparently inconsistent carbon isotope values are represented due to these reactions guo et al 2014 wang et al 2014 nowak et al 2017 fe isotope systematics can be used to constrain the pathways and mechanisms of fe redox transformations which has potentially important implications for the mobilization of adsorbed and or occluded p in the fe oxyhydr oxides beard et al 2003 li et al 2012 wu et al 2019 however thus far the joint use of stable carbon isotopes in dic and fe isotopes has not been considered in investigating the mechanism of p mobilization in groundwater systems the dongting plain dtp as a part of the central yangtze river basin is a typical quaternary alluvial lacustrine plain water quality deterioration especially eutrophication has become a major concern in this region this can lead to toxic cyanobacteria blooms in surface water and manifest as mortality of native aquatic organisms reduction of biodiversity and impacts on human health moal et al 2019 schneider et al 2019 according to the results of our recent work high concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus tdp up to 3 58 mg l were detected in the pleistocene aquifers of the dtp huang et al 2021 far exceeding the tdp limit value of 0 4 mg l for surface water eutrophication in many countries barrera et al 2001 chinese gb3838 2002 cardoso et al 2009 the long term interaction between high tdp groundwater and abundant surface water systems in the dtp poses significant ecological threats to surface water systems in the area sun et al 2021 hence the following main objectives of this research were to i investigate the spatial distribution and sources of p in groundwater of the dtp ii reveal the biogeochemical processes explaining geogenic p release from natural om and p rich fe iii oxyhydr oxides and iii provide a new methodology for investigating them 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the dtp in the south part of the middle reaches of the yangtze river china fig 1 it is an alluvial lacustrine plain surrounded by relatively elevated hills and mountains such as the luoxiao mountains wuling mountains and xuefeng mountains li et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the mountains around the basin have altitudes ranging from 300 to 800 m and they are mainly composed of silicate minerals quartz sandstone slate granite generally of cretaceous k to paleogene e age hunan geological survey institute 2016 he 2020 dongting lake the largest lake in this area and the second largest freshwater lake in china is fed by seven inlets including four tributaries yuan river li river xiang river and zi river originating from surrounding mountains and three distributaries ouchi river hudu river songzi river originating from the yangtze river the water discharge of the three water inlets and the four upstream rivers controls 91 of the recharge entering the lake which also influenced the variation of the dominating chemical constituents in the lake area huang et al 2014 habiyakare et al 2021 this area has a subtropical monsoon climate with annual temperature ranging from 16 4 c to 17 0 c the mean annual precipitation and evaporation are 1100 1400 and 1150 1500 mm respectively hunan geological survey institute 2016 huang et al 2021 continuous tectonic subsidence of the basin and uplift of the mountains has resulted in an exceedingly thick accumulation of sediments thousands of years ago the dtp was a huge area of marshland known as the yunmeng marsh during which time large amounts of wetland plant residues were rapidly deposited followed by burial in subsurface sediments zhou 1994 chen 2019 during the holocene these sandy alluvial lacustrine plains were covered with peat and clay which are currently found at the surface and subsurface throughout the dtp sun et al 2020 the shallow sediments of the dtp consist mainly of holocene qh and late pleistocene qp 3 silty clay locally interlayered silt mostly 15 to 20 m thick which function as an aquitard the lithology of the underlying porous aquifer with thicknesses from 50 to 80 m is mainly qp 2 fine to coarse sand with a small amount of gravel below the porous aquifers there is a deeper confined porous fissure aquifer composed of early pleistocene qp 1 and neogene n sediments hunan geological survey institute 2016 huang et al 2021 fig 1 groundwater in this area is recharged through downward infiltration of precipitation and some seepage from natural lakes and drains and discharged through artificial abstraction weak evaporation and discharge into adjacent surface water the overall direction of groundwater flow within the dtp is from southwest to northeast huang et al 2021 sun et al 2021 this study focused on the upper part of the porous aquifer which is not only the main horizon of water supply for local residents but also has potentially close hydraulic connection to dongting lake hunan geological survey institute 2016 xu et al 2019 sun et al 2021 2 2 water sampling and analysis a total of 77 groundwater samples and 3 surface water samples were collected throughout the dtp in september 2018 august 2019 and august 2020 all groundwater samples were sampled at depths ranging from 12 to 58 m below the land surface and thus the groundwater samples in this study were mainly from the upper part of the porous aquifer fig 1 details on sampling and preservation of groundwater are provided in the supporting

data can be used to improve the understanding of factors regulating p mobilization in this study correlation analysis was performed using all ion concentrations of groundwater samples and boxplots were drew using all calculated fluorescence characteristic indexes of om the ibm spss statistics v25 0 0 commercial software package was used for statistical analysis before conducting analysis of variance and producing pearson s correlation coefficients the distributional shapes of the variables of data sets were examined to determine the extent to which the sample data met the assumption of normality the pearson s product moment correlation coefficient r was used to assess the strength of any association between parameters the p value was used as an indicator of the level of significance and a smaller p value means that there is stronger evidence in favor of the results of statistical analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and source of phosphorus groundwater tdp concentrations ranged from 0 02 to 3 58 mg l with an average value of 0 71 mg l approximately 48 of the samples showed tdp concentrations higher than 0 4 mg l which is the limit value for surface water eutrophication in many countries barrera et al 2001 chinese gb3838 2002 cardoso et al 2009 what s more there were still about 19 of the groundwater samples with tdp concentration exceeding 1 mg l groundwater with high p concentration at such range 1 mg l may pose a great threat to surface water eutrophication which is therefore termed high p groundwater in this study table s1 the ph and eh values of the groundwater samples ranged from 5 89 to 7 90 median 6 96 and from 146 4 to 159 7 mv median 72 1 mv respectively generally groundwater ph was circum neutral and lower eh values from 123 3 to 49 0 mv were observed in high p groundwater fig s1a the ec values ranged from 94 7 to 988 0 μs cm median 445 0 μs cm and show a positive relationship with tdp concentrations r 0 624 p 0 001 fig s1b high tdp levels in groundwater were generally associated with high fe2 concentrations and tdp and fe2 concentrations exhibited a positive correlation r 0 71 p 0 001 fig 2 a in addition tdp concentration was positively correlated with nh4 n concentration r 0 71 p 0 001 and moderately correlated with doc concentration r 0 45 p 0 001 fig 2b d according to the groundwater chemistry of the dtp high p groundwater is commonly found in a reducing and sluggish environment probably attributable to the 10 20 m thick low permeability clayey layer overlying the aquifer as an aquitard hunan geological survey institute 2016 huang et al 2021 the high ec values of high p groundwater suggest that tdp concentrations are high in sluggish hydrogeologic environments with long residence time and long term water rock interactions the cl br mass ratio is a useful parameter for distinguishing components of natural origin 250 from those of wastewater origin up to several thousands in groundwater davis et al 1998 mcarthur et al 2012 this is because om degradation concentrates br rather than cl whereas leachates from human sewage have high cl br ratios due to addition of common salt such as cl groundwater samples with high tdp levels have fairly low cl br ratios 50 fig s1c which are considered to be credible evidence of natural p sources mcarthur et al 2012 yang et al 2020b high concentrations of tdp are associated with low concentrations of so4 2 no3 and cl fig s1d e f in the humid dtp the elevated concentrations of so4 2 no3 and cl are generally attributable to anthropogenic input rotiroti et al 2017 du et al 2020 these further suggest natural geogenic enrichment as the main source of groundwater tdp rather than anthropogenic input the naturally occurring p in groundwater is mainly sourced from aquifer sediments in the dtp which consist of p associated with buried natural om as well as primary and secondary minerals mainly as p rich iron or calcareous minerals the positive correlation between tdp and nh4 n suggests that p enrichment is closely related to processes controlling nh4 n mobilization fig 2b ammonium is widely known to be released into groundwater from the mineralization of n containing om and it is hard to be oxidized to nitrate in anoxic aquifers jiao et al 2010 du et al 2021 moreover huang et al 2021 reported that the high concentration of nh4 n in the groundwater of the dtp originates from mineralization of nitrogen containing om thus the mineralization of om containing p may be an important process controlling p release into the aqueous phase however the nh4 n p ratios of the groundwater samples suggest that groundwater p also originates from other sources besides om mineralization the nh4 n p ratio of 16 1 or higher is commonly found in wetland vegetation and is called the redfield ratio redfield et al 1963 bedford et al 1999 although the redfield ratio may vary among different organisms and at different spatial scales klausmeier et al 2004 sterner et al 2008 they will eventually approach a certain range of ratios as biogeochemical cycle this is because microbial communities or other organisms tend to get rid of excess proportions though this homeostatic capacity is limited elser et al 2005 cross et al 2007 fitter and hillebrand 2009 thus when pore water nh4 n p is greater than or equal to 16 i e the redfield ratio p is derived almost exclusively from the mineralization of organic phosphorus op mcarthur et al 2001 additional p input to groundwater would decrease the nh4 n p ratio to lower than the redfield ratio in this case the amount of additional p is compared with the amount of p produced by op mineralization calculated from the redfield ratio and nh4 n concentrations in the sample if the former is less than the latter i e 8 nh4 n p 16 op mineralization still dominates if the former is greater than the latter i e nh4 n p 8 additional p input dominates over op mineralization tao et al 2020 in this study approximately 21 of the groundwater samples corresponded to p released by op mineralization in approximately 18 of the groundwater samples additional sources of p were present but op mineralization remained dominant approximately 61 of samples showed nh4 n p 8 indicating that the main sources of groundwater p in the dtp are primary and secondary p rich minerals mainly as p rich iron or calcareous minerals rather than buried om containing p nevertheless the rapid dissolution of p rich calcareous minerals tends to appear in acidic groundwater environments thus their contribution to p enrichment is low in the circum neutral zone the ph range of the study area 5 89 7 90 sjöberg and rickard 1984 fulmer et al 2002 wang et al 2005 this assumption can also be supported by the relatively weak correlation between ca2 and tdp concentrations therefore the dissolution or desorption of p rich fe minerals mainly fe iii oxyhydr oxides should be the main source of groundwater p enrichment the strong positive correlation between tdp and fe2 fig 2a coupled with the lower eh fig s1a of the groundwater system indicate that p is mobilized via the fe iii reduction pathway p is strongly bound to fe iii oxyhydr oxides and under reducing conditions fe iii is used as an electron acceptor in microbial respiration subsequently re immobilizing p in groundwater 3 2 effect of om degradation on phosphorus mobilization p is an essential element for life and it is incorporated into numerous biomolecules natural om can therefore be considered as one of the main reservoirs of p which can be mobilized from sedimentary om to the aqueous phase through enzymatic and surface catalyzed hydrolytic processes in the subsurface environment jackson and schindler 1975 ansems 2012 in addition natural om is redox active and can act as a terminal electron donor in anaerobic microbial respiration aeschbacher et al 2010 klüpfel et al 2014 which affects the solubility of redox sensitive phases in the case of fe3 solubility increases with lower eh releasing adsorbed p although dic in groundwater systems may derive from various sources hackley et al 2010 han and plummer 2016 based on the geology history as introduced in section 2 1 and the p source analysis in section 3 1 microbially mediated oxidation of om is a very important and even dominated source of dic and worthy of our attention in process of geogenic p mobilization there are typically two apparently inconsistent groundwater redox chemistry in or around the oxidized om showing signs of both mildly reduced conditions with fe ii and more strongly reduced conditions indicated by the presence of methane jakobsen 2007 om undergoes different stages of oxidation degradation under these two different reduction conditions which we name here as normal om degradation stage and intense om degradation stage the same below different stages of om degradation will also result in different range of δ 13c value δ 13c generally between 25 and 18 or a relatively positive δ 13c value wachniew 2006 guo et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 therefore the δ 13c compositions in dic controlled by microbial degradation can serve as a powerful tool for illustrating the stage of om degradation in geogenic p mobilization groundwater δ 13c dic values ranged between 24 4 and 4 8 with a median value of 8 6 in the present study table s1 the plot of δ 13c dic values vs tdp levels clearly shows the presence of two different groups of δ 13c dic values with p enrichment in groundwater probably due to different stages of om degradation fig 3 during microbially mediated degradation of om in mildly reduced conditions its 12c is preferentially taken up by respiration clark and fritz 1997 zhou et al 2018 xue et al 2019 theoretically causing relatively lower δ 13c dic value of groundwater this may explain the weak decrease in δ 13c dic with increasing tdp concentration zone 1 in fig 3 in a range of considerably low δ 13c dic values between 15 and 30 however this decrease trend is insignificant and the reasons might be the small fractionation factor between om and om derived dic and the results of overlapping factors including other sources of dic such as carbonate dissolution and carbon stable isotope compositions in indigenous om zhou et al 2018 when om degradation proceeds to the stage of methanogenesis ch4 is produced by the fermentative disproportionation of low molecular compounds such as acetic acid or the reduction of co2 by hydrogen or monohydric alcohols both of which can enrich 13c in produced or residual dic penger et al 2012 huang and hall 2018 li et al 2019 du et al 2020 this probably explains the gradual increase of δ 13c dic values with increasing tdp concentrations zone 2 in fig 3 in a range of more positive δ 13c dic values between 15 and 5 groundwater samples with high p concentrations clearly appear to be mostly plotted in zone 2 fig 3 which suggests that p mobilization is more associated with methanogenesis this can be further confirmed by the statistically significant correlation between tdp and ch4 concentrations r 0 75 p 0 001 fig 2c a deeper understanding of om sources and types with these two different stages of om degradation can be obtained by analyzing the fluorescence characteristics of dom in groundwater samples the study used the humification index hix biological index bix and fuorescence index fi to characterize the dom of groundwater smith et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 du et al 2020 the hix values widely varied from 0 28 to 8 59 with a median of 2 59 the values of bix and fi were 0 61 1 41 median 0 88 and 1 13 2 04 median 1 39 respectively tdp concentration was positively correlated with hix r 0 39 p 0 01 and negatively correlated with bix r 0 34 p 0 01 at the intense om degradation stage i e methanogenesis zone 2 in fig 3 and fig 4 groundwater exhibited relatively higher hix and lower bix and fi values than at the normal om degradation stage i e om degradation before ch4 production zone 1 in fig 3 and fig 4 this suggests that groundwater dom is more humic and less autochthonous at the intense om degradation stage a recent incubation experiment revealed that the hydrolysis and production of doc are less efficient and microorganisms tend to utilize refractory humic like dom under methanogenic conditions gan et al 2020 through detailed laboratory experiments aromokeye et al 2021 also proposed that crystallized fe oxyhydr oxides could accelerate both methanogenesis and degradation instead of preserving recalcitrant om in sediments in contrast labile om is prone to being targeted prior to the methanogenesis stage jakobsen and postma 1999 kulkarni et al 2017 liu et al 2020 differences in the n p ratio i e nh4 n p ratio and fe2 concentration under two different stages of om degradation are compared in fig 3 overall groundwater samples subjected to intense om degradation stage i e zone 2 appear to have higher n p ratios than those subjected to normal om degradation stage i e zone 1 when om degradation in strongly reduced conditions the enrichment of p is more associated with the degradation of organic phosphorus and the n p ratios become closer or equal to the redfield ratio redfield et al 1963 mcarthur et al 2001 tao et al 2020 in addition zone 2 exhibited a higher fe2 concentration than zone 1 this finding is interesting and suggests an active and ongoing reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides exists at the intense om degradation stage as previously mentioned the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides is critical for groundwater p enrichment this process could probably potentially have a significant influence on p mobilization in groundwater 3 3 effect of fe iii reduction on phosphorus mobilization fe iii oxyhydr oxides are excellent p adsorbents in oxidizing environments by virtue of their large surface area and surface properties goldberg and sposito 1985 and p incorporation into primary and secondary fe minerals is thermodynamically predicted or demonstrated to occur even at very low levels hyacinthe and van cappellen 2004 sapota et al 2006 when redox conditions are favorable for the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides adsorbed and or occluded p is simultaneously released into the surrounding groundwater einsele and vetter 1938 stumm and sulzberger 1992 orihel et al 2015 in addition the heterogeneity of the fe oxyhydr oxides in sediments and the types of electron donors affect the extent to which fe iii is reduced which may further affect p mobility jakobsen and postma 1999 neidhardt et al 2018 kappler et al 2021 biogeochemical processes involved in the fe cycle can fractionate stable fe isotopes anbar et al 2005 dauphas et al 2017 wu et al 2019 and thus fe isotopic signatures may serve as important indications of the pathways and mechanisms of p mobilization related to the fe redox cycle the measured fe isotopic compositions δ 56fe of the groundwater ranged from 0 14 to 0 81 and had a median value of 0 31 n 9 table s1 the most pronounced fe isotope fractionation typically occurs during redox processes johnson et al 2002 anbar et al 2005 thus the large fe isotope variations observed in this study may indicate the widespread presence of an fe redox cycle within the aquifer catalyzed by microbial fe iii reduction which is also the main process contributing to p enrichment in groundwater fig 5 shows the relationship among δ 56fe and δ 13c dic values and fe2 and tdp concentrations in 9 groundwater samples one sample corresponds to the normal om degradation stage as defined by its carbon isotope value and had a lower δ 56fe value of 0 13 other groundwater samples correspond to the intense om degradation stage with the exception of two samples δ 56fe values generally increased with increasing fe2 concentrations it is generally accepted that in the presence of fe reducing bacteria fe ii aq is usually depleted in heavy fe isotopes compared to the substrate during the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides brantley et al 2001 emmanuel et al 2005 yang et al 2020a the result represented by points in fig 5 appears to contradict the principle of fe isotope fractionation during microbial ferric reduction however it should be noted that only the mineral surface can be actively dissolved and that the dissolution process is governed simultaneously by both thermodynamics and kinetics of the solid solution interface stumm and sulzberger 1992 wiederhold 2015 thus when lighter fe isotopes are preferentially released first the newly formed isotopically heavier mineral surfaces will later be dissolved allowing dissolution to continue as a result the subsequent δ 56fe in the aqueous phase from the residual 56fe enriched fe iii pool would be relatively larger compared to the initial δ 56fe values this may explain the co increasing trend of δ 56fe values and fe2 concentrations for samples corresponding to the intense om degradation stage in our study the lack of the co increasing trend in the two samples may be attributable to overlapping processes including fe ii mineral precipitation e g feco3 and re adsorption of fe ii which may also lead to fe isotopic fractionation severmann et al 2006 sivan et al 2011 wu et al 2019 as previously discussed in fig 3b the intense om degradation stage i e zone 2 might exist an active and ongoing process that causes the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides in the section on the influence of om on p mobilization it was proposed that crystallized fe oxyhydr oxides could accelerate both methanogenesis and degradation of recalcitrant om in sediments which have also been documented in recent studies kato et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 viggi et al 2014 li et al 2015 aromokeye et al 2021 this is mainly supported by the concurrent dual role of crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides during recalcitrant om degradation involving microorganisms in addition to serving as an electron acceptor crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides also act as conduits in the pathway of microbial utilization microorganisms have the potential to transfer electrons to methanogens in the sediment matrix via mineral mediated direct interspecies electron transfer mdiet leading to accelerated methanogenesis in mixed magnetite or hematite slurries kato et al 2012 aromokeye et al 2018 therefore the reductive dissolution of highly crystallized fe oxyhydr oxides coupled with the degradation of recalcitrant om under methanogenic conditions could significantly mobilize fe ii and further p in contrast readily reducible poorly crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides species such as ferrihydrite have frequently been reported to have inhibitory effect on microbial methanogenesis in natural and artificial environments frenzel et al 1999 chidthaisong and conrad 2000 lueders and friedrich 2002 qu et al 2004 reiche et al 2008 hori et al 2010 two different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the inhibitory effects one is the fe iii reducing microorganisms reduce the levels of common electron donors acetate or hydrogen available for methane production and thus increase the contribution of fe iii reduction to degradation of om at the expense of methanogenesis lueders and friedrich 2002 van bodegom et al 2004 another proposed mechanism is the direct inhibition of methanogens by poorly crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides methanogens require a low redox potential for growth and are inhibited at high redox potentials in microhabitats such as those caused by the presence of ferrihydrite straub et al 2001 hirano et al 2013 either way under methanogenic conditions the reductive dissolution of poorly crystallized fe oxyhydr oxides should not be considered as active process that significantly mobilize fe ii and further p moreover fe iii dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane fe aom is possible and supported by thermodynamics in the presence of fe iii valentine 2002 sivan et al 2011 which can also lead to reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides however a general increase in ch4 concentrations and δ 13c dic values with increasing δ 56fe values fig 5 suggests that the fe aom is not a significant process because ch4 would be consumed and more 12c would be enriched in produced dic if this process dominates these suggest the microbial fe iii reduction occurring at the intense om degradation stage uses highly crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides in contrast at the normal om degradation stage amorphous or poorly crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides are more available for reduction than highly crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides in addition amorphous or poorly crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides is usually lighter in fe isotope composition than highly crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides johnson et al 2003 which results in samples corresponding to the normal om degradation stage generally having lighter δ56fe values than that those corresponding to the intense om degradation stage 3 4 coupled influence of fe and om on geogenic p mobilization this study clearly shows the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides and om degradation are significant processes with regard to geogenic p mobilization our study suggests two different processes between fe iii oxyhydr oxides and om contribute to the high concentrations of tdp in groundwater fig 6 shows a conceptual model that incorporates the above mechanisms according to the results of this study under moderately reducing conditions labile om is firstly oxidized and drives microbial reduction of amorphous fe iii oxyhydr oxides if fe reducing microorganisms are present and other terminal electron acceptors oxygen and nitrate are depleted subsequently the adsorbed and or occluded p on into om or amorphous fe iii oxyhydr oxides is concomitantly released into ambient groundwater another process is that under strongly reducing conditions quite intense om degradation would have taken place in the groundwater with high tdp concentrations up to the stage of methanogenesis under such conditions highly crystalline fe iii oxyhydr oxides would enhance both methanogenesis and degradation instead of preservation of recalcitrant om which in turn releases fe2 into groundwater and further influence the mobility of p in light of our results groundwater samples with high p concentrations in the dtp clearly appear to be more associated with methanogenesis therefore the latter p mobilizing redox processes were identified to prevail over the former in the groundwater alternatively om fe p ternary complexes erro et al 2012 urrutia et al 2014 as a potentially significant or even dominant portion of the sediment p pool may change or enrich the understanding of p mobilization mechanism in groundwater however this speculation should be further explored 4 conclusions this study provides a first attempt to jointly use stable carbon isotopes in dic and fe isotopes to study the biogeochemical cycling and behavior of geogenic p in alluvial lacustrine aquifer systems based on the groundwater chemistry high tdp groundwater is commonly found in a reducing and sluggish environment with long residence time and long term water rock interactions the main source of high tdp in the studied aquifer is natural geogenic enrichment rather than anthropogenic input geogenic p in groundwater was related to co burial of abundant om and fe iii oxyhydr oxides and the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxides is the main process controlling groundwater p enrichment studied groundwater had δ 13c dic values ranged between 24 4 and 4 8 with a median value of 8 6 δ 56fe values in groundwater samples ranged between 0 14 and 0 81 with a median of 0 31 the combined stable carbon isotopes in dic and fe isotopes indicate that i under moderately reducing conditions i e om degradation before ch4 production labile om is oxidized with amorphous fe iii oxyhydr oxides acting as electron acceptors subsequently the adsorbed and or occluded p on into om or amorphous fe iii oxyhydr oxides is concomitantly released into groundwater ii under strongly reducing conditions i e methanogenesis the degradation of recalcitrant om depends on the concurrent roles of crystalline fe iii oxyhydr oxides as electron acceptors and conduits which further influence the mobility of p and the latter p mobilizing redox processes was identified to prevail over the former in the groundwater of dtp comparing p concentrations in various groundwater systems worldwide we find that the levels of geogenic p are generally higher than those affected by anthropogenic inputs yuce et al 2006 mcginley et al 2016 stuart and lapworth 2016 liao et al 2019 tao et al 2020 bu et al 2020 in order to obtain and predict the spatial and temporal distribution of such high level of geogenic p more quickly and accurately we need to continuously fill in the gap of the mobilization and enrichment mechanism of it more scientific and systematic indoor incubation experiments need to be carried out and more characterization techniques and data analysis methods need to be combined etc in addition high p groundwater could be discharged to lakes or rivers through long term interactions between groundwater and surface water gw sw and its role in the eutrophication of surface water bodies warrants more attention considering the numerous complex processes involved in quantifying p loads from groundwater to surface water the p cycle in the hyporheic zone linking gw sw needs to be understood in further detail therefore future research on geogenic p mobilization should be extended to gw sw systems especially gw sw

3611,iron fe oxyhydr oxides and organic matter om are important hosts of geogenic phosphorus p in groundwater systems however the coupled influence of fe oxyhydr oxides and om on the occurrence and mobility of p in groundwater remains unclear in this study we shed light on the underlying mechanisms of the control of fe oxyhydr oxides and om on p mobilization in the alluvial lacustrine aquifers at the dongting plain dtp central china using tracing techniques of isotopes δ 13c dic and δ 56fe characterization of dissolved organic matter dom and groundwater geochemistry the results suggest that high concentrations of geogenic p up to 3 58 mg l as total dissolved phosphorus tdp tend to occur in relatively reducing and sluggish hydrogeological environments experiencing longer time of water rock interactions and are closely related to the reductive dissolution of p rich fe iii oxyhydr oxides as well as the mineralization of organic p our observations suggest that two different processes between fe iii oxyhydr oxides and om contribute to the high concentrations of tdp in groundwater firstly under moderately reducing conditions labile om is oxidized with amorphous fe iii oxyhydr oxides acting as electron acceptors subsequently the adsorbed and or occluded p on into om or amorphous fe iii oxhydr oxides is concomitantly released into groundwater secondly under strongly reducing conditions the degradation of recalcitrant om depends on the concurrent roles of crystalline fe iii oxyhydr oxides as electron acceptors and conduits which further influence the mobility of p the latter p mobilizing redox processes were identified to prevail over the former in the groundwater of dtp this study provides new insights into the anomalous concentration of p in groundwater of alluvial lacustrine sandy aquifer systems keywords phosphorus iron organic matter groundwater stable isotope 1 introduction in recent decades increasing evidence has indicated that global phosphorus p pollution could be more serious in groundwater than previously predicted holman et al 2010 meinikmann et al 2015 liao et al 2019 tao et al 2020 the discharge of groundwater with high concentrations of p into surface waters strongly affects the trophic status of water bodies it may cause freshwater eutrophication and complicate freshwater restoration efforts zhang et al 2020 yu et al 2021 thus understanding the sources and mechanisms of p mobilization in aquifer systems is critical for effectively improving the global freshwater environment high concentrations p in groundwater often originate from anthropogenic sources such as agricultural production industrial activities mining activities etc meinikmann et al 2015 gerla and gbolo 2018 ančić et al 2020 different from them geogenic p in groundwater refer to that originate from the aquifer matrices and have been enriched under complex geological and hydrogeochemical conditions although there is a consensus that geogenic p is released from sediment hosted p into groundwater the roles of organic matter om and p rich minerals mainly p rich iron or calcareous minerals in p mobilization remain controversial nevertheless the following three mechanisms of the release of geogenic p have generally been accepted i solid om or aqueous phase om represent potential sources of p which can release p during microbially mediated mineralization kalbitz et al 2000 allison and vitousek 2005 ii biodegradable om can fuel microbial respiration leading to rapid depletion of dissolved terminal electron acceptors when redox conditions favorable for the reductive dissolution of iron fe oxyhydr oxides are reached adsorbed and or occluded p is simultaneously released into groundwater neidhardt et al 2018 warrinnier et al 2020 iii for other p rich minerals especially calcareous minerals such as apatite their rapid dissolution usually occurs in acidic groundwater environments so their contribution is low in neutral groundwater environments fulmer et al 2002 overall om and fe serve the most critical roles in geogenic p cycling in most of aquifer systems especially in alluvial lacustrine plains where om and fe oxyhydr oxides are abundant in aquifer sediments understanding the process of om degradation and further identifying the redox transformation pathway of fe iii oxyhydr oxides can help to improve our understanding of geogenic p mobilization stable carbon isotopes in dissolved inorganic carbon dic and fe isotopes are powerful tools for gaining insights into om degradation and fe biogeochemical cycling respectively although the mineralization of om containing p involves various complex biogeochemical reactions dic is continuously produced as a result and apparently inconsistent carbon isotope values are represented due to these reactions guo et al 2014 wang et al 2014 nowak et al 2017 fe isotope systematics can be used to constrain the pathways and mechanisms of fe redox transformations which has potentially important implications for the mobilization of adsorbed and or occluded p in the fe oxyhydr oxides beard et al 2003 li et al 2012 wu et al 2019 however thus far the joint use of stable carbon isotopes in dic and fe isotopes has not been considered in investigating the mechanism of p mobilization in groundwater systems the dongting plain dtp as a part of the central yangtze river basin is a typical quaternary alluvial lacustrine plain water quality deterioration especially eutrophication has become a major concern in this region this can lead to toxic cyanobacteria blooms in surface water and manifest as mortality of native aquatic organisms reduction of biodiversity and impacts on human health moal et al 2019 schneider et al 2019 according to the results of our recent work high concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus tdp up to 3 58 mg l were detected in the pleistocene aquifers of the dtp huang et al 2021 far exceeding the tdp limit value of 0 4 mg l for surface water eutrophication in many countries barrera et al 2001 chinese gb3838 2002 cardoso et al 2009 the long term interaction between high tdp groundwater and abundant surface water systems in the dtp poses significant ecological threats to surface water systems in the area sun et al 2021 hence the following main objectives of this research were to i investigate the spatial distribution and sources of p in groundwater of the dtp ii reveal the biogeochemical processes explaining geogenic p release from natural om and p rich fe iii oxyhydr oxides and iii provide a new methodology for investigating them 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the dtp in the south part of the middle reaches of the yangtze river china fig 1 it is an alluvial lacustrine plain surrounded by relatively elevated hills and mountains such as the luoxiao mountains wuling mountains and xuefeng mountains li et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the mountains around the basin have altitudes ranging from 300 to 800 m and they are mainly composed of silicate minerals quartz sandstone slate granite generally of cretaceous k to paleogene e age hunan geological survey institute 2016 he 2020 dongting lake the largest lake in this area and the second largest freshwater lake in china is fed by seven inlets including four tributaries yuan river li river xiang river and zi river originating from surrounding mountains and three distributaries ouchi river hudu river songzi river originating from the yangtze river the water discharge of the three water inlets and the four upstream rivers controls 91 of the recharge entering the lake which also influenced the variation of the dominating chemical constituents in the lake area huang et al 2014 habiyakare et al 2021 this area has a subtropical monsoon climate with annual temperature ranging from 16 4 c to 17 0 c the mean annual precipitation and evaporation are 1100 1400 and 1150 1500 mm respectively hunan geological survey institute 2016 huang et al 2021 continuous tectonic subsidence of the basin and uplift of the mountains has resulted in an exceedingly thick accumulation of sediments thousands of years ago the dtp was a huge area of marshland known as the yunmeng marsh during which time large amounts of wetland plant residues were rapidly deposited followed by burial in subsurface sediments zhou 1994 chen 2019 during the holocene these sandy alluvial lacustrine plains were covered with peat and clay which are currently found at the surface and subsurface throughout the dtp sun et al 2020 the shallow sediments of the dtp consist mainly of holocene qh and late pleistocene qp 3 silty clay locally interlayered silt mostly 15 to 20 m thick which function as an aquitard the lithology of the underlying porous aquifer with thicknesses from 50 to 80 m is mainly qp 2 fine to coarse sand with a small amount of gravel below the porous aquifers there is a deeper confined porous fissure aquifer composed of early pleistocene qp 1 and neogene n sediments hunan geological survey institute 2016 huang et al 2021 fig 1 groundwater in this area is recharged through downward infiltration of precipitation and some seepage from natural lakes and drains and discharged through artificial abstraction weak evaporation and discharge into adjacent surface water the overall direction of groundwater flow within the dtp is from southwest to northeast huang et al 2021 sun et al 2021 this study focused on the upper part of the porous aquifer which is not only the main horizon of water supply for local residents but also has potentially close hydraulic connection to dongting lake hunan geological survey institute 2016 xu et al 2019 sun et al 2021 2 2 water sampling and analysis a total of 77 groundwater samples and 3 surface water samples were collected throughout the dtp in september 2018 august 2019 and august 2020 all groundwater samples were sampled at depths ranging from 12 to 58 m below the land surface and thus the groundwater samples in this study were mainly from the upper part of the porous aquifer fig 1 details on sampling and preservation of groundwater are provided in the supporting

data can be used to improve the understanding of factors regulating p mobilization in this study correlation analysis was performed using all ion concentrations of groundwater samples and boxplots were drew using all calculated fluorescence characteristic indexes of om the ibm spss statistics v25 0 0 commercial software package was used for statistical analysis before conducting analysis of variance and producing pearson s correlation coefficients the distributional shapes of the variables of data sets were examined to determine the extent to which the sample data met the assumption of normality the pearson s product moment correlation coefficient r was used to assess the strength of any association between parameters the p value was used as an indicator of the level of significance and a smaller p value means that there is stronger evidence in favor of the results of statistical analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and source of phosphorus groundwater tdp concentrations ranged from 0 02 to 3 58 mg l with an average value of 0 71 mg l approximately 48 of the samples showed tdp concentrations higher than 0 4 mg l which is the limit value for surface water eutrophication in many countries barrera et al 2001 chinese gb3838 2002 cardoso et al 2009 what s more there were still about 19 of the groundwater samples with tdp concentration exceeding 1 mg l groundwater with high p concentration at such range 1 mg l may pose a great threat to surface water eutrophication which is therefore termed high p groundwater in this study table s1 the ph and eh values of the groundwater samples ranged from 5 89 to 7 90 median 6 96 and from 146 4 to 159 7 mv median 72 1 mv respectively generally groundwater ph was circum neutral and lower eh values from 123 3 to 49 0 mv were observed in high p groundwater fig s1a the ec values ranged from 94 7 to 988 0 μs cm median 445 0 μs cm and show a positive relationship with tdp concentrations r 0 624 p 0 001 fig s1b high tdp levels in groundwater were generally associated with high fe2 concentrations and tdp and fe2 concentrations exhibited a positive correlation r 0 71 p 0 001 fig 2 a in addition tdp concentration was positively correlated with nh4 n concentration r 0 71 p 0 001 and moderately correlated with doc concentration r 0 45 p 0 001 fig 2b d according to the groundwater chemistry of the dtp high p groundwater is commonly found in a reducing and sluggish environment probably attributable to the 10 20 m thick low permeability clayey layer overlying the aquifer as an aquitard hunan geological survey institute 2016 huang et al 2021 the high ec values of high p groundwater suggest that tdp concentrations are high in sluggish hydrogeologic environments with long residence time and long term water rock interactions the cl br mass ratio is a useful parameter for distinguishing components of natural origin 250 from those of wastewater origin up to several thousands in groundwater davis et al 1998 mcarthur et al 2012 this is because om degradation concentrates br rather than cl whereas leachates from human sewage have high cl br ratios due to addition of common salt such as cl groundwater samples with high tdp levels have fairly low cl br ratios 50 fig s1c which are considered to be credible evidence of natural p sources mcarthur et al 2012 yang et al 2020b high concentrations of tdp are associated with low concentrations of so4 2 no3 and cl fig s1d e f in the humid dtp the elevated concentrations of so4 2 no3 and cl are generally attributable to anthropogenic input rotiroti et al 2017 du et al 2020 these further suggest natural geogenic enrichment as the main source of groundwater tdp rather than anthropogenic input the naturally occurring p in groundwater is mainly sourced from aquifer sediments in the dtp which consist of p associated with buried natural om as well as primary and secondary minerals mainly as p rich iron or calcareous minerals the positive correlation between tdp and nh4 n suggests that p enrichment is closely related to processes controlling nh4 n mobilization fig 2b ammonium is widely known to be released into groundwater from the mineralization of n containing om and it is hard to be oxidized to nitrate in anoxic aquifers jiao et al 2010 du et al 2021 moreover huang et al 2021 reported that the high concentration of nh4 n in the groundwater of the dtp originates from mineralization of nitrogen containing om thus the mineralization of om containing p may be an important process controlling p release into the aqueous phase however the nh4 n p ratios of the groundwater samples suggest that groundwater p also originates from other sources besides om mineralization the nh4 n p ratio of 16 1 or higher is commonly found in wetland vegetation and is called the redfield ratio redfield et al 1963 bedford et al 1999 although the redfield ratio may vary among different organisms and at different spatial scales klausmeier et al 2004 sterner et al 2008 they will eventually approach a certain range of ratios as biogeochemical cycle this is because microbial communities or other organisms tend to get rid of excess proportions though this homeostatic capacity is limited elser et al 2005 cross et al 2007 fitter and hillebrand 2009 thus when pore water nh4 n p is greater than or equal to 16 i e the redfield ratio p is derived almost exclusively from the mineralization of organic phosphorus op mcarthur et al 2001 additional p input to groundwater would decrease the nh4 n p ratio to lower than the redfield ratio in this case the amount of additional p is compared with the amount of p produced by op mineralization calculated from the redfield ratio and nh4 n concentrations in the sample if the former is less than the latter i e 8 nh4 n p 16 op mineralization still dominates if the former is greater than the latter i e nh4 n p 8 additional p input dominates over op mineralization tao et al 2020 in this study approximately 21 of the groundwater samples corresponded to p released by op mineralization in approximately 18 of the groundwater samples additional sources of p were present but op mineralization remained dominant approximately 61 of samples showed nh4 n p 8 indicating that the main sources of groundwater p in the dtp are primary and secondary p rich minerals mainly as p rich iron or calcareous minerals rather than buried om containing p nevertheless the rapid dissolution of p rich calcareous minerals tends to appear in acidic groundwater environments thus their contribution to p enrichment is low in the circum neutral zone the ph range of the study area 5 89 7 90 sjöberg and rickard 1984 fulmer et al 2002 wang et al 2005 this assumption can also be supported by the relatively weak correlation between ca2 and tdp concentrations therefore the dissolution or desorption of p rich fe minerals mainly fe iii oxyhydr oxides should be the main source of groundwater p enrichment the strong positive correlation between tdp and fe2 fig 2a coupled with the lower eh fig s1a of the groundwater system indicate that p is mobilized via the fe iii reduction pathway p is strongly bound to fe iii oxyhydr oxides and under reducing conditions fe iii is used as an electron acceptor in microbial respiration subsequently re immobilizing p in groundwater 3 2 effect of om degradation on phosphorus mobilization p is an essential element for life and it is incorporated into numerous biomolecules natural om can therefore be considered as one of the main reservoirs of p which can be mobilized from sedimentary om to the aqueous phase through enzymatic and surface catalyzed hydrolytic processes in the subsurface environment jackson and schindler 1975 ansems 2012 in addition natural om is redox active and can act as a terminal electron donor in anaerobic microbial respiration aeschbacher et al 2010 klüpfel et al 2014 which affects the solubility of redox sensitive phases in the case of fe3 solubility increases with lower eh releasing adsorbed p although dic in groundwater systems may derive from various sources hackley et al 2010 han and plummer 2016 based on the geology history as introduced in section 2 1 and the p source analysis in section 3 1 microbially mediated oxidation of om is a very important and even dominated source of dic and worthy of our attention in process of geogenic p mobilization there are typically two apparently inconsistent groundwater redox chemistry in or around the oxidized om showing signs of both mildly reduced conditions with fe ii and more strongly reduced conditions indicated by the presence of methane jakobsen 2007 om undergoes different stages of oxidation degradation under these two different reduction conditions which we name here as normal om degradation stage and intense om degradation stage the same below different stages of om degradation will also result in different range of δ 13c value δ 13c generally between 25 and 18 or a relatively positive δ 13c value wachniew 2006 guo et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 therefore the δ 13c compositions in dic controlled by microbial degradation can serve as a powerful tool for illustrating the stage of om degradation in geogenic p mobilization groundwater δ 13c dic values ranged between 24 4 and 4 8 with a median value of 8 6 in the present study table s1 the plot of δ 13c dic values vs tdp levels clearly shows the presence of two different groups of δ 13c dic values with p enrichment in groundwater probably due to different stages of om degradation fig 3 during microbially mediated degradation of om in mildly reduced conditions its 12c is preferentially taken up by respiration clark and fritz 1997 zhou et al 2018 xue et al 2019 theoretically causing relatively lower δ 13c dic value of groundwater this may explain the weak decrease in δ 13c dic with increasing tdp concentration zone 1 in fig 3 in a range of considerably low δ 13c dic values between 15 and 30 however this decrease trend is insignificant and the reasons might be the small fractionation factor between om and om derived dic and the results of overlapping factors including other sources of dic such as carbonate dissolution and carbon stable isotope compositions in indigenous om zhou et al 2018 when om degradation proceeds to the stage of methanogenesis ch4 is produced by the fermentative disproportionation of low molecular compounds such as acetic acid or the reduction of co2 by hydrogen or monohydric alcohols both of which can enrich 13c in produced or residual dic penger et al 2012 huang and hall 2018 li et al 2019 du et al 2020 this probably explains the gradual increase of δ 13c dic values with increasing tdp concentrations zone 2 in fig 3 in a range of more positive δ 13c dic values between 15 and 5 groundwater samples with high p concentrations clearly appear to be mostly plotted in zone 2 fig 3 which suggests that p mobilization is more associated with methanogenesis this can be further confirmed by the statistically significant correlation between tdp and ch4 concentrations r 0 75 p 0 001 fig 2c a deeper understanding of om sources and types with these two different stages of om degradation can be obtained by analyzing the fluorescence characteristics of dom in groundwater samples the study used the humification index hix biological index bix and fuorescence index fi to characterize the dom of groundwater smith et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 du et al 2020 the hix values widely varied from 0 28 to 8 59 with a median of 2 59 the values of bix and fi were 0 61 1 41 median 0 88 and 1 13 2 04 median 1 39 respectively tdp concentration was positively correlated with hix r 0 39 p 0 01 and negatively correlated with bix r 0 34 p 0 01 at the intense om degradation stage i e methanogenesis zone 2 in fig 3 and fig 4 groundwater exhibited relatively higher hix and lower bix and fi values than at the normal om degradation stage i e om degradation before ch4 production zone 1 in fig 3 and fig 4 this suggests that groundwater dom is more humic and less autochthonous at the intense om degradation stage a recent incubation experiment revealed that the hydrolysis and production of doc are less efficient and microorganisms tend to utilize refractory humic like dom under methanogenic conditions gan et al 2020 through detailed laboratory experiments aromokeye et al 2021 also proposed that crystallized fe oxyhydr oxides could accelerate both methanogenesis and degradation instead of preserving recalcitrant om in sediments in contrast labile om is prone to being targeted prior to the methanogenesis stage jakobsen and postma 1999 kulkarni et al 2017 liu et al 2020 differences in the n p ratio i e nh4 n p ratio and fe2 concentration under two different stages of om degradation are compared in fig 3 overall groundwater samples subjected to intense om degradation stage i e zone 2 appear to have higher n p ratios than those subjected to normal om degradation stage i e zone 1 when om degradation in strongly reduced conditions the enrichment of p is more associated with the degradation of organic phosphorus and the n p ratios become closer or equal to the redfield ratio redfield et al 1963 mcarthur et al 2001 tao et al 2020 in addition zone 2 exhibited a higher fe2 concentration than zone 1 this finding is interesting and suggests an active and ongoing reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides exists at the intense om degradation stage as previously mentioned the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides is critical for groundwater p enrichment this process could probably potentially have a significant influence on p mobilization in groundwater 3 3 effect of fe iii reduction on phosphorus mobilization fe iii oxyhydr oxides are excellent p adsorbents in oxidizing environments by virtue of their large surface area and surface properties goldberg and sposito 1985 and p incorporation into primary and secondary fe minerals is thermodynamically predicted or demonstrated to occur even at very low levels hyacinthe and van cappellen 2004 sapota et al 2006 when redox conditions are favorable for the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides adsorbed and or occluded p is simultaneously released into the surrounding groundwater einsele and vetter 1938 stumm and sulzberger 1992 orihel et al 2015 in addition the heterogeneity of the fe oxyhydr oxides in sediments and the types of electron donors affect the extent to which fe iii is reduced which may further affect p mobility jakobsen and postma 1999 neidhardt et al 2018 kappler et al 2021 biogeochemical processes involved in the fe cycle can fractionate stable fe isotopes anbar et al 2005 dauphas et al 2017 wu et al 2019 and thus fe isotopic signatures may serve as important indications of the pathways and mechanisms of p mobilization related to the fe redox cycle the measured fe isotopic compositions δ 56fe of the groundwater ranged from 0 14 to 0 81 and had a median value of 0 31 n 9 table s1 the most pronounced fe isotope fractionation typically occurs during redox processes johnson et al 2002 anbar et al 2005 thus the large fe isotope variations observed in this study may indicate the widespread presence of an fe redox cycle within the aquifer catalyzed by microbial fe iii reduction which is also the main process contributing to p enrichment in groundwater fig 5 shows the relationship among δ 56fe and δ 13c dic values and fe2 and tdp concentrations in 9 groundwater samples one sample corresponds to the normal om degradation stage as defined by its carbon isotope value and had a lower δ 56fe value of 0 13 other groundwater samples correspond to the intense om degradation stage with the exception of two samples δ 56fe values generally increased with increasing fe2 concentrations it is generally accepted that in the presence of fe reducing bacteria fe ii aq is usually depleted in heavy fe isotopes compared to the substrate during the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides brantley et al 2001 emmanuel et al 2005 yang et al 2020a the result represented by points in fig 5 appears to contradict the principle of fe isotope fractionation during microbial ferric reduction however it should be noted that only the mineral surface can be actively dissolved and that the dissolution process is governed simultaneously by both thermodynamics and kinetics of the solid solution interface stumm and sulzberger 1992 wiederhold 2015 thus when lighter fe isotopes are preferentially released first the newly formed isotopically heavier mineral surfaces will later be dissolved allowing dissolution to continue as a result the subsequent δ 56fe in the aqueous phase from the residual 56fe enriched fe iii pool would be relatively larger compared to the initial δ 56fe values this may explain the co increasing trend of δ 56fe values and fe2 concentrations for samples corresponding to the intense om degradation stage in our study the lack of the co increasing trend in the two samples may be attributable to overlapping processes including fe ii mineral precipitation e g feco3 and re adsorption of fe ii which may also lead to fe isotopic fractionation severmann et al 2006 sivan et al 2011 wu et al 2019 as previously discussed in fig 3b the intense om degradation stage i e zone 2 might exist an active and ongoing process that causes the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides in the section on the influence of om on p mobilization it was proposed that crystallized fe oxyhydr oxides could accelerate both methanogenesis and degradation of recalcitrant om in sediments which have also been documented in recent studies kato et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 viggi et al 2014 li et al 2015 aromokeye et al 2021 this is mainly supported by the concurrent dual role of crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides during recalcitrant om degradation involving microorganisms in addition to serving as an electron acceptor crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides also act as conduits in the pathway of microbial utilization microorganisms have the potential to transfer electrons to methanogens in the sediment matrix via mineral mediated direct interspecies electron transfer mdiet leading to accelerated methanogenesis in mixed magnetite or hematite slurries kato et al 2012 aromokeye et al 2018 therefore the reductive dissolution of highly crystallized fe oxyhydr oxides coupled with the degradation of recalcitrant om under methanogenic conditions could significantly mobilize fe ii and further p in contrast readily reducible poorly crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides species such as ferrihydrite have frequently been reported to have inhibitory effect on microbial methanogenesis in natural and artificial environments frenzel et al 1999 chidthaisong and conrad 2000 lueders and friedrich 2002 qu et al 2004 reiche et al 2008 hori et al 2010 two different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the inhibitory effects one is the fe iii reducing microorganisms reduce the levels of common electron donors acetate or hydrogen available for methane production and thus increase the contribution of fe iii reduction to degradation of om at the expense of methanogenesis lueders and friedrich 2002 van bodegom et al 2004 another proposed mechanism is the direct inhibition of methanogens by poorly crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides methanogens require a low redox potential for growth and are inhibited at high redox potentials in microhabitats such as those caused by the presence of ferrihydrite straub et al 2001 hirano et al 2013 either way under methanogenic conditions the reductive dissolution of poorly crystallized fe oxyhydr oxides should not be considered as active process that significantly mobilize fe ii and further p moreover fe iii dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane fe aom is possible and supported by thermodynamics in the presence of fe iii valentine 2002 sivan et al 2011 which can also lead to reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides however a general increase in ch4 concentrations and δ 13c dic values with increasing δ 56fe values fig 5 suggests that the fe aom is not a significant process because ch4 would be consumed and more 12c would be enriched in produced dic if this process dominates these suggest the microbial fe iii reduction occurring at the intense om degradation stage uses highly crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides in contrast at the normal om degradation stage amorphous or poorly crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides are more available for reduction than highly crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides in addition amorphous or poorly crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides is usually lighter in fe isotope composition than highly crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides johnson et al 2003 which results in samples corresponding to the normal om degradation stage generally having lighter δ56fe values than that those corresponding to the intense om degradation stage 3 4 coupled influence of fe and om on geogenic p mobilization this study clearly shows the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides and om degradation are significant processes with regard to geogenic p mobilization our study suggests two different processes between fe iii oxyhydr oxides and om contribute to the high concentrations of tdp in groundwater fig 6 shows a conceptual model that incorporates the above mechanisms according to the results of this study under moderately reducing conditions labile om is firstly oxidized and drives microbial reduction of amorphous fe iii oxyhydr oxides if fe reducing microorganisms are present and other terminal electron acceptors oxygen and nitrate are depleted subsequently the adsorbed and or occluded p on into om or amorphous fe iii oxyhydr oxides is concomitantly released into ambient groundwater another process is that under strongly reducing conditions quite intense om degradation would have taken place in the groundwater with high tdp concentrations up to the stage of methanogenesis under such conditions highly crystalline fe iii oxyhydr oxides would enhance both methanogenesis and degradation instead of preservation of recalcitrant om which in turn releases fe2 into groundwater and further influence the mobility of p in light of our results groundwater samples with high p concentrations in the dtp clearly appear to be more associated with methanogenesis therefore the latter p mobilizing redox processes were identified to prevail over the former in the groundwater alternatively om fe p ternary complexes erro et al 2012 urrutia et al 2014 as a potentially significant or even dominant portion of the sediment p pool may change or enrich the understanding of p mobilization mechanism in groundwater however this speculation should be further explored 4 conclusions this study provides a first attempt to jointly use stable carbon isotopes in dic and fe isotopes to study the biogeochemical cycling and behavior of geogenic p in alluvial lacustrine aquifer systems based on the groundwater chemistry high tdp groundwater is commonly found in a reducing and sluggish environment with long residence time and long term water rock interactions the main source of high tdp in the studied aquifer is natural geogenic enrichment rather than anthropogenic input geogenic p in groundwater was related to co burial of abundant om and fe iii oxyhydr oxides and the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxides is the main process controlling groundwater p enrichment studied groundwater had δ 13c dic values ranged between 24 4 and 4 8 with a median value of 8 6 δ 56fe values in groundwater samples ranged between 0 14 and 0 81 with a median of 0 31 the combined stable carbon isotopes in dic and fe isotopes indicate that i under moderately reducing conditions i e om degradation before ch4 production labile om is oxidized with amorphous fe iii oxyhydr oxides acting as electron acceptors subsequently the adsorbed and or occluded p on into om or amorphous fe iii oxyhydr oxides is concomitantly released into groundwater ii under strongly reducing conditions i e methanogenesis the degradation of recalcitrant om depends on the concurrent roles of crystalline fe iii oxyhydr oxides as electron acceptors and conduits which further influence the mobility of p and the latter p mobilizing redox processes was identified to prevail over the former in the groundwater of dtp comparing p concentrations in various groundwater systems worldwide we find that the levels of geogenic p are generally higher than those affected by anthropogenic inputs yuce et al 2006 mcginley et al 2016 stuart and lapworth 2016 liao et al 2019 tao et al 2020 bu et al 2020 in order to obtain and predict the spatial and temporal distribution of such high level of geogenic p more quickly and accurately we need to continuously fill in the gap of the mobilization and enrichment mechanism of it more scientific and systematic indoor incubation experiments need to be carried out and more characterization techniques and data analysis methods need to be combined etc in addition high p groundwater could be discharged to lakes or rivers through long term interactions between groundwater and surface water gw sw and its role in the eutrophication of surface water bodies warrants more attention considering the numerous complex processes involved in quantifying p loads from groundwater to surface water the p cycle in the hyporheic zone linking gw sw needs to be understood in further detail therefore future research on geogenic p mobilization should be extended to gw sw systems especially gw sw

3612,effective watershed management and protection of water resources from non point source pollution require identification prioritization and targeting of pollutant source areas process based hydrology and water quality models are powerful heuristic tools for land and water resources managers however because of their complexity such models are often under utilized as management prioritization and planning tools in this paper we present a prioritization interactive visualization and analysis tool pi vat that is programmed to synthesize multi scenario multi watershed outputs from process based geospatial models we demonstrate the utility of pi vat to examine simulated hydrologic sediment and water quality response at the hillslope hydrologic response unit hru scale we apply pi vat to output from multiple watersheds and for multiple management scenarios and treatments from two geospatial models for watershed management water erosion prediction project wepp and soil water assessment tool swat pi vat was developed using the shiny web application framework for the r programming language in a matter of minutes pi vat can synthesize overwhelming amounts of output from process based models into information useful for land and water resources managers we illustrate the use of pi vat to interactively identify quantify and visualize areas that are most susceptible to disturbance under different scenarios and provide a synthesis approach based on land use soil type and slope steepness this approach guides land and water resources managers in prioritizing the areas of the watershed that provide the maximum reduction in pollutant loads while treating the least amount of area pi vat provides a flexible reactive platform for the development of decision support tools based on process based models intended for watershed management and research applications keywords decision support tools targeted management prioritization process based models wepp swat 1 introduction water quality concerns from non point source pollution nps are a challenge for land and water resources managers effective management of nps requires strategic targeting and prioritization of watershed areas for implementing best management practices bmps diebel et al 2008 such targeting and prioritization typically consist of the identification of pollutant source areas and subsequent management to reduce water quality degradation daggupati et al 2011 easton et al 2017 process based hydrology and water quality simulation models have shown the capability to evaluate the potential effects of land management and climate scenarios on water quantity and quality for example a review of various process based distributed watershed models by wellen et al 2015 reported that 83 of the reviewed scientific studies 257 published between the year 1992 and 2010 used one of these five models soil and water assessment tool swat integrated catchment model inca annualized agricultural non point source pollution model agnps annagnps hydrological simulation program fortran hspf and hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv such models can provide a link between management decisions and watershed response and provide a scientific basis for management decisions rode et al 2010 the utility of these process based models is not only to provide spatially explicit predictions of runoff and erosion but also to provide a deeper understanding of the key factors and dominant hydrologic processes and flow paths that drive the detachment and transport of sediment and associated pollutants brooks et al 2015 characteristically such models have been successfully applied predominantly by the scientific community for a management scenario oriented impact assessment on water quality and quantity to identify priority source areas and to formulate management plans for instance the utility of the swat model has been widely demonstrated in the scenario based evaluation of the efficacy of site specific bmps on water quality as well as in the targeting of bmps placement for improving water quality briak et al 2019 daggupati et al 2011 easton et al 2010 liu et al 2019 merriman et al 2019 park et al 2014 xu et al 2019 similarly the wepp model has been successfully used for guiding watershed managers in the selection and placement of the bmps in forested watersheds efta and chung 2014 robichaud et al 2007 it has also been applied for investigating the effectiveness of conservation management practices and targeted management in agricultural watersheds brooks et al 2015 pandey et al 2009 singh et al 2011 other models recognized in wellen et al 2015 were used to investigate sediment and nutrients response under alternative management scenarios as well as to identify priority areas for erosion control measures and to assess the bmps effectiveness on nutrient loading abdelwahab et al 2014 ahn and kim 2016 bastrup birk and gundersen 2004 gudino elizondo et al 2019 luo et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 despite this demonstrated usefulness the use of process based models by managers in what if scenario testing has been limited to date ease of use extensive model setup and training requirements often form barriers to the adoption and effective use of process based models in the planning process garen et al 1999 there is also a strong need to disseminate the information generated by these models to stakeholders and decision makers in a functional format the recent evolution of web based user interfaces for some models attempts to partly address these barriers for example swatonline simplifies swat data querying as well as enables simple data visualizations mcdonald et al 2019 the hydrologic and water quality system hawqs makes it easier to set up and run the swat model at the hydrologic unit codes hucs 8 to 12 or larger scale and provides users with summary visualization capabilities and the ability to download an entire project to be used on a local computer yen et al 2016 to enhance the use of process based models in informed decision making an online watershed interface weppcloud has been developed to make use of the water erosion prediction project wepp model across the us by watershed managers easier and more convenient dobre et al n d this interface was specifically developed for forestry applications as part of the forest service suite of models https forest moscowfsl wsu edu fswepp and its use recently has been extended to rangeland landscapes weppcloud rhem as well lew et al n d web based user interfaces make the models more accessible and easier to use but do not necessarily provide the data summaries and visualizations in a functional format to compare multiple watershed simulations of different management options and facilitate what if scenario testing to develop an action plan and ensure appropriate and effective management practices are implemented managers need to understand the key hydrologic drivers and factors soil type land use land cover slope and climate involved in the transport of the pollutant and the sensitivity of these factors to pollutant transport the amount of simulated output generated by process based models especially when using the model to assess multiple management options over multiple years in unique land types within a watershed can be overwhelming end user e g watershed managers would require extensive training in geospatial analysis and modeling to process the output in essence process based models are very useful tools for ingesting big data as model input however they can also generate an equal amount of big data that can be equally daunting for end users to synthesize and extract useful knowledge for identifying and spatially prioritizing bmps a multiple scenario simulation from a hillslope or hru based geospatial model for even a relatively small watershed and short daily weather time series can easily generate hundreds to thousands of targeting combinations fig 1 integrating what if scenario information with decision support tools would enable watershed managers to harness the potential of sophisticated process based models and truly aid in decision making brooks et al 2015 emphasized the need to connect science and management by improving process based planning tools such that crucial information is available to planners to target areas in the landscape brooks et al 2015 demonstrated the use of a simplified web interface consisting of post processing algorithms built on top of the wepp model to effectively support bmp assessment and planning the number of commercial and open source platforms for hosting online tools has led to an explosion in web based applications and has provided an opportunity to develop geospatial decision support tools for example tools developed using shiny an open source web application framework developed by the rstudio team r core team 2021 have enabled the creation of interactive web applications that allow users to interact dynamically with the model simulations since its inception the use of shiny has increased steadily as evidenced by peer reviewed papers through which specialists in academic fields disseminated knowledge to stakeholders kasprzak et al 2020 while shiny has been used across a diverse range of academic fields to our knowledge few peer reviewed papers in the earth and environmental sciences have used the shiny web application framework for instance klein et al 2017 developed the webxtreme tool to facilitate agroclimatic risk evaluation under climate change webxtreme has provided an important link between scientists and decision makers whateley et al 2015 used shiny to develop a web based decision support tool that provides an interactive environment to water managers and stakeholders to explore water supply system vulnerabilities to climate change this tool targeted at small scale water supply systems provides an opportunity for more dynamic and collaborative water resources management the objectives of this work were to develop a stand alone post processing interactive analysis and visualization tool that can ingest complex spatially distributed output from geospatial hydrologic models and to demonstrate its use as a decision support tool for scenario oriented planning and management we developed the prioritization visualization and analysis tool pi vat that synthesizes tabular and map based outputs for multiple watersheds and scenarios we demonstrate the utility of the tool with watershed case studies using outputs from two of the most well known hydrologic management models wepp and swat we describe its development and demonstrate its use in evaluating and guiding land and water resources management decisions in three watershed case studies 2 methods 2 1 interface implementation pi vat is an interactive tool developed for the identification and prioritization of pollutant hotspots and areas suitable for targeted management currently pi vat ingests output from two of the most widely used hydrologic models wepp and swat using the shiny web application framework for the r programming language beeley and sukhdeve 2018 chang et al 2021 r core team 2021 pi vat is deployed on the shinyapps io server and can be accessed at https cdeval shinyapps io pi vat the pi vat source code can be found on the github page of the tool https github com devalc pi vat pi vat requires users to have pre computed scenario runs using either online or offline wepp or swat interfaces information on summarizing and preparing multiple pre computed scenarios for use in pi vat is provided on the pi vat s github page 2 2 main interface components the pi vat interface intuitively guides the user through a what if analysis from data input to dynamic visualization fig 2 each tab on the pi vat user interface consists of two sections the input control panel and the visualization summary panel as shown in fig 3 the visualization summary panel was implemented using the r wrappers for the plotly leaflet and datatables cheng et al 2021 sievert 2020 xie et al 2021 making it fully interactive the input control panel contains four main options denoted by numbers in fig 3 namely data import options and three auto populated dropdown menus for the watershed scenario and the targeted water quality quantity metric respectively the input panel provides users with the ability to upload output files from the hydrologic model select water quality quantity metrics of interest and control visualization and data summaries by using the control buttons we specifically included synthesis products based on feedback from watershed managers for scenario testing watershed applications three of the most common suggestions are to provide the ability to i compare impacts from different management options within a single sub watershed ii identify priority watersheds or hillslopes to implement a particular management practice iii assess trade offs from the implementation of particular management practice in the first case the user needs to have the ability to visualize and compare multiple treatments in a single watershed in the second case the user needs to be able to summarize and visualize differences across unique spatial units in the third case a manager may also want to better understand the implications of management options from multiple responses e g reduced runoff and increased subsurface lateral flow to identify whether a management practice may result in a positive environmental impact from one perspective but at the cost of creating another environmental problem from another perspective in addition a manager may want to identify the most sensitive areas in the landscape which give the greatest benefit from the application of a particular management practice e g sediment reduction per unit area of the watershed treated furthermore a manager may also want to ascertain unique soil landscape and climatic characteristics that make this identified landscape area very sensitive to the particular treatment managers can also be constrained by specific regulatory policies which limit the application of practice to a specific region e g no logging timber on slopes 30 in this case the manager would like to focus the analysis on treatable areas within the watershed these management challenges are common to nearly all watershed studies brooks et al 2015 mulla et al 2008 rittenburg et al 2015 and therefore we developed the tool pi vat to address these objectives specifically pi vat provides the ability to graphically compare differences in the magnitude of a certain simulated output e g sediment yield from multiple management scenarios on a single chart heatmap bar chart for spatial analysis the tool can map these differences in simulated output between two scenarios in a particular watershed to identify watersheds sensitive to a particular management scenario pi vat also provides the option to generate charts and maps comparing the magnitude of a simulated output for a single management scenario across multiple watersheds it provides the option to select and analyze single or multiple hydrologic response output variables pi vat also provides cumulative distribution figures which display the percent of the hydrologic or pollutant response output within a watershed vs the cumulative percent area from which the pollutant was generated within the watershed users can then use slider bars to filter the output and identify the areas which contribute the greatest source loading per unit area of the watershed this is particularly useful where a manager might have limited financial resources which only allow the treatment of a small fraction of the watershed similar filter options have been implemented to narrow the analysis to a particular slope steepness range for example pi vat allows users to select and only display output from areas having a slope steepness greater than and or less than a certain minimum and or maximum slope to assist users in the identification of key factors and hydrologic drivers pi vat continuously updates downloadable output tables based on user selected options which include not only multiple output hydrologic response variables but also key soil topographic and climatic input factors 2 3 site descriptions we selected three case studies from three regions consisting of either a forest or an agricultural system lake tahoe basin california nevada palouse washington and we 38 sub watershed within the mahantango experimental watershed south central pennsylvania we selected sub watersheds in these regions based on the unique land uses and the associated land management and water quality concerns in each area we first describe the sites and in section 2 4 describe the modeling scenarios 2 3 1 lake tahoe basin lake tahoe despite being in an ultra oligotrophic state coats et al 2008 hatch et al 2001 has experienced long term declining water clarity due to upland contributions of fine sediment and phosphorus sahoo et al 2013 previous research suggests that the primary productivity of the lake has been increasing by about 5 per year coats et al 2008 and in the last five decades the secchi depth of lake tahoe has decreased by about 10 m kerlin 2017 fire suppression in the lake tahoe basin during the 20th century has resulted in forest floor accumulation of duff and woody debris which has increased the risk of frequent and more intense wildfires miller et al 2010 land managers in the basin are interested in comparing the impacts of wildfires and timber harvest on water quality to identify sensitive areas in the landscape for targeted management in this case study we used pi vat to evaluate the effects of several forest treatments thinning and wildfire scenarios on sediment yield from multiple watersheds we considered seven watersheds with areas ranging between 4 1 km2 and 110 km2 and an average of 626 hillslopes in each watershed and a total of 11 simulated scenarios ranging from forest treatments such as thinning and prescribed fire to wildfires this amounts to 48 202 combinations of hillslopes along with the associated soils land uses and slope steepness that were evaluated for targeted management 2 3 2 palouse washington conventional tillage management on the steep hillslopes of the dryland wheat based cropping systems within the inland pacific northwest palouse region has caused excessive soil erosion aggressive tillage with low residual ground cover has left a degraded landscape it was estimated that the topsoil was completely removed from 10 of the cropland and one fourth to three fourths was lost from 60 of the region usda 1978 subsoil horizons in the region can often include dense subsoil calcium carbonate bk argillic btb and fragipan btxb soil horizons that lead to perched water tables subsurface lateral flow and saturation excess runoff processes brooks et al 2012 mcdaniel et al 2008 erosion rates can be reduced through the adoption of conservation tillage practices however the effectiveness varies by topography soil type and climate kok et al 2009 in this watershed case study we examine the effects of tillage management on the sediment yield within the thorn creek 109 km2 and kamiache creek 40 km2 watersheds located within the 381 to 457 mm mean annual precipitation zone in the palouse soil and water conservation districts are interested in incentivizing conservation tillage practices on the hillslopes which contribute the greatest benefit to the cost ratio from the treatment application these watersheds implement a three year crop rotation consisting of winter wheat spring barley summer fallow each watershed has an average of 1590 hillslopes and a total of three simulated management scenarios resulting in 9 540 combinations three types of tillage systems were compared a conventional tillage system ct with a chisel plow a minimum or mulch tillage mt scenario and a no till system nt 2 3 3 we 38 experimental sub watershed managing the transport delivery and long term legacy of excessive phosphorus loading from agriculturally dominated landscapes is a well documented challenge particularly in the eastern us with a long history of dairy operations and impacts on soil chemistry kleinman et al 2011 sharpley et al 2001 1994 stackpoole et al 2019 accurately identifying nutrient source areas dominant delivery mechanisms and the impact of management strategies on phosphorus loading is therefore an essential step to avoid long term water quality impairment in downstream water bodies we 38 is a 7 3 km2 first order upland agricultural experimental sub watershed located within the larger 420 km2 mahantango creek experimental watershed it was established in 1976 by the usda agricultural research service to better understand the water quantity and water quality implications of agriculturally based farming systems in pennsylvania and particularly for better understanding nutrient loading to chesapeake bay buda et al 2011 we 38 is known for its variable source area hydrology driven by topographic variability and perched water tables over fragipan subsoil horizons bryant et al 2011 in the case of the we 38 sub watershed we use pi vat to examine the effects of varying soil phosphorus content manure application and tillage and cropping management on phosphorus and nutrient losses collick et al 2015 we considered six sub watersheds of we 38 with a total of 1 286 hrus and eight simulated management scenarios resulting in a 10 288 combination of hrus that can be considered for targeted management 2 4 synthesis approach our synthesis approach demonstrates the application of pi vat for multi watershed multi scenario simulated results from wepp and swat with a focus on targeting and prioritizing management we demonstrate the utility of the tool rather than assess the accuracy or validate the model predictions because several previous validation studies already have shown the accuracy of wepp boll et al 2015 brooks et al 2016 elliot et al 2015 srivastava et al 2020 srivastava et al 2017 and swat collick et al 2015 easton et al 2010 2009 xu et al 2019 model predictions to demonstrate the utility of pi vat we used wepp model output for the lake tahoe and palouse case studies generated using the weppcloud interface for the lake tahoe test case we considered the current conditions curcond scenario as the baseline scenario and for the palouse test case we considered conventional till ct as the baseline scenario for the we 38 case study we used swat vsa model output easton et al 2008 and considered the high rate spring surface manure application scenario as the baseline scenario in the synthesis from the target combinations described in each case study we respond to land and water resources managers desires to be able to identify which watershed and hillslopes to prioritize and what treatment management to implement to minimize water quality impacts in the synthesis approach we answer the following general targeting questions aimed at addressing the unique water quality problem in each case study described before a which watersheds are a major concern with respect to the pollutant of concern b how sensitive is this watershed to the disturbances and changes in management practices c what amount of the watershed needs to be treated to reduce the loading of the pollutant of concern d where are these source areas located in the watershed how do they compare to the baseline scenario what are the general driving factors in these areas 3 results 3 1 lake tahoe basin the lake tahoe basin case study presents pi vat usefulness for identifying critical source areas of sediment in forested environments with fire risk a large amount of sediment yield and soil loss from both hillslopes and channels for the baseline scenario emerges from the blackwood creek watershed 41 followed by the ward creek watershed 20 fig 4 a b the sediment yield and soil loss are generally larger in the cases of fire scenarios whereas these increases in the case of thinning management scenarios are comparatively small fig 4c the largest contribution of the total hillslope soil loss 54 and the sediment yield 27 across scenarios arises from the high severity highsev fire scenario fig 4d in the case of the 85 thinning scenario thin85 this contribution of total hillslope soil loss and sediment yield across scenarios amounted to 2 and 4 respectively more than 80 of the total sediment yield in the blackwood creek watershed across three different scenarios comes from only 25 of the total hillslope area fig 5 a in this 25 of the total hillslope area the cumulative sediment yield increased from the baseline scenario by 195 mg for the thinning scenario thinn85 and 1264 mg for the low severity fire scenario lowsev respectively fig 5c the relative difference in sediment yield between the comparison scenario and the baseline scenario from all hillslopes in the blackwood creek watershed fig 5b and fig 5d shows the same for the top 25 of the total hillslopes contributing maximum sediment yield table a 1 lists the top 15 hillslopes with a maximum increase in sediment yield relative to the baseline scenario for example the highest absolute increase in sediment yield 25191 kg ha 1 compared to the baseline scenario occurs from hillslope 2211 which is characterized as a melody rock outcrop soil and an average slope steepness of 42 table a 1 for each of these top 25 contributing hillslopes supplemental table a 3 lists the sediment yield from the comparison scenario and its relative change from the baseline scenario along with the land use soil characteristics and slope description approximately 85 of these hillslopes have a steepness greater than 30 and the majority of these soils are rock outcrop complexes or sandy loam soils 3 2 palouse the palouse case study presents pi vat usefulness for identifying critical source areas of sediment of agricultural basins under different tillage intensities relatively large soil losses from both hillslopes and channels for the baseline scenario occur in the thorn creek watershed whereas relatively large sediment yield occurs from the kamiache creek watershed fig 6 a pi vat visuals indicated that the majority of the sediment yield in the region 67 was generated from the kamiache creek watershed with a much smaller percentage 33 generated from the thorn creek watershed fig 6b when compared across different management scenarios the relative sediment yield and soil loss from the kamiache creek watershed occurs in the following order ct mt nt fig 6c the largest contribution 40 of the total hillslope soil loss and the sediment yield across scenarios arises from the ct practices fig 6d whereas the smallest contribution 25 of the total hillslope soil loss and the sediment yield across scenarios arises from the nt practices fig 6d about 80 85 of the total sediment yield in the kamiache creek watershed across the three different scenarios comes from only 15 of the total hillslope area fig 7 a in this 15 of the total hillslope area the cumulative sediment yield decreased by about 6 mg and 11 5 mg by switching from ct to mt and nt management practices respectively fig 7c fig 7b shows the relative difference in sediment yield between the comparison scenario and the baseline scenario from all the hillslopes in the kamiache creek watershed and fig 7d shows the same for the top 15 of the total hillslopes contributing maximum sediment yield table a 2 lists the top 15 hillslopes with a maximum increase in sediment yield relative to the baseline scenario the highest absolute increase of 4 08 kg ha 1 from the baseline scenario occurs at hillslope 23 which has an average slope steepness of 17 and chard silt loam soil table a 2 supplemental table a 4 lists the sediment yield from the comparison scenario and its relative change from the baseline scenario for these top 15 of the total contributing hillslopes generally soil erosion increased with slope steepness and slope length and was greatest where conventional tillage practices were employed in winter wheat spring barley summer fallow rotations in chard silt loams which have dense calcium carbonate bk horizon at 90 cm below the soil surface 3 3 we 38 the pi vat analysis of we 38 indicates a phosphorus response to management which is sensitive to treatment and the form of the phosphorus transported mineral and organic phosphorus kg transported with water out of the reach decreases in the following reach order number 6 1 2 3 4 5 fig 8 a however when normalized by the area of each subbasin the largest transport of mineral p attached to the sediment and soluble p into the reach occurs from subbasin 3 in the business as usual scenario fig 8b and d also for the same scenario the amount of mineral p attached to the sediment transported into the reach decreases by subbasin in the following subbasin order number 3 6 5 2 4 1 and for the transport of soluble p decreases by the subbasin order number 3 1 4 2 5 6 fig 8b and d the highest mineral phosphorus 20 and organic phosphorus 18 transported through stream reach 3 compared across all the scenarios occur for the business as usual scenario whereas adopting a low rate spring injection manure application method the mineral phosphorus and organic phosphorus transport through stream reach 3 reduces to 8 and 11 respectively reductions in organic a sediment b and soluble c phosphorus losses from corn silage land within subbasin 3 by converting from business as usual manure application methods to the high rate spring injection method are displayed in fig 9 the reduction in phosphorus transport from an alternative or comparison management option scenario relative to a baseline scenario along with the specific land use soil type and slope descriptions for organic sediment and soluble phosphorus output responses are listed in supplemental tables a 5 a 7 respectively 4 discussion in each of the case studies pi vat was able to ingest large output files from multiple watersheds for multiple management scenarios synthesis results very clearly identify not only the greatest hydrologic response to treatment but also where the pollutant was generated the type of pollutant which was most sensitive and knowledge on key factors and characteristics soil type or topographic of the most sensitive landscape positions this type of scenario comparison and detailed synthesis is cumbersome as these hydrologic models are developed to provide output for one scenario at a time comparison of multiple scenarios in wepp for example often requires a user to upload output files into spreadsheets or use programming languages such as r which is very time consuming and complicated for typical land managers who would like this type of comparative analysis pi vat significantly reduced the time and complexity of such comparative analyses allowing the managers to carry out the what if analysis in a matter of minutes in all three case studies we saw that the effectiveness of management practices was not equal across a landscape suggesting that targeted management strategies rather than blanketed management would be successful and will likely be cost effective this is a well known and documented finding for large watershed management studies walter et al 2000 here however we showed that pi vat can quickly visualize this using modeling output especially when a land manager may be trying to convince stakeholders and investors of implementing a targeted management approach not only was pi vat able to show where targeted responses to management will occur in these watersheds but the tool also quickly provided the location and characteristics of the targeted locations as well as the hydrologic responses in the dominant hydrologic flow paths in particular for we 38 we see that the phosphorus response to treatment varied by the delivered form of phosphorus pi vat was able to show that this varied response by the delivered form of phosphorus was also associated with the hydrologic pathways for instance the spatial patterns of sediment bound phosphorus were similar to that of the runoff from the hrus we demonstrated using pi vat that comparative visualization and analysis can help identify pollutant source areas for prioritizing targeted management for all three cases pi vat s comparative analysis was able to directly identify locations in the landscape where the greatest relative unit decrease in the response of the pollutant of concern occurred from the application of different management practices for example generally in the lake tahoe and palouse analysis we found that specific soil types with restrictive soil horizons were often the most sensitive to treatments in the lake tahoe case study land types characterized as having steep slopes with rock outcrops and gravelly sandy loam soils had the potential to generate high to very high surface runoff in addition these land types were often identified as landscape positions having the greatest sensitivity to alternative management practices given the abundance of process based hydrology and water quality models coupled with the increased use of data driven analytics the broader opportunities for the hydrologic community to integrate models with decision tools are vast and yet unrealized guswa et al 2014 such integration would enable land and water resources managers to harness the potential of these sophisticated models in decision making with the three case studies we demonstrated the potential utility of pi vat as a standalone tool in bridging the barriers in the use of two commonly employed sophisticated hydrology and water quality models wepp and swat for management prioritization by making the results available to managers in an interactive and functional format pi vat has the potential to assist watershed managers in using the physically based models more regularly alongside their current planning process and effectively communicating the implications of proposed managements 5 conclusions land and water resources managers are interested in the optimal use of conservation dollars to protect water resources from nps sediments nutrients and other water quality issues associated with land management practices this requires identifying prioritizing and targeting critical source areas for implementing conservation management practices process based models that account for the relevant physical processes are powerful tools and can be effective for prioritization and targeted watershed management provided the outputs from these models are made available to the managers in a more functional format we demonstrate the use of pi vat to interactively identify quantify and visualize the areas that are most susceptible to disturbance and change in management we provide a synthesis approach based on land use soil type and slope steepness such that the synthesized data and visuals can aid managers in identifying watersheds subbasins of concern evaluating the sensitivity of these watersheds subbasins to land management practices quantifying and isolating source areas for treatment management and understanding factors driving hydrologic and water quality response we demonstrate the utility of pi vat in facilitating a better understanding of the critical pollution source areas and in devising an action plan the simplicity and accessibility of this web based interactive tool along with compatibility to process both wepp and swat based outputs can greatly support watershed planning using complex process based models the tool was developed such that it can be potentially quickly modified to ingest output from any model that can provide tabular files from spatial modeling units represented by geospatial maps and therefore has the potential to be widely adopted as a decision support tool for multiple

3612,effective watershed management and protection of water resources from non point source pollution require identification prioritization and targeting of pollutant source areas process based hydrology and water quality models are powerful heuristic tools for land and water resources managers however because of their complexity such models are often under utilized as management prioritization and planning tools in this paper we present a prioritization interactive visualization and analysis tool pi vat that is programmed to synthesize multi scenario multi watershed outputs from process based geospatial models we demonstrate the utility of pi vat to examine simulated hydrologic sediment and water quality response at the hillslope hydrologic response unit hru scale we apply pi vat to output from multiple watersheds and for multiple management scenarios and treatments from two geospatial models for watershed management water erosion prediction project wepp and soil water assessment tool swat pi vat was developed using the shiny web application framework for the r programming language in a matter of minutes pi vat can synthesize overwhelming amounts of output from process based models into information useful for land and water resources managers we illustrate the use of pi vat to interactively identify quantify and visualize areas that are most susceptible to disturbance under different scenarios and provide a synthesis approach based on land use soil type and slope steepness this approach guides land and water resources managers in prioritizing the areas of the watershed that provide the maximum reduction in pollutant loads while treating the least amount of area pi vat provides a flexible reactive platform for the development of decision support tools based on process based models intended for watershed management and research applications keywords decision support tools targeted management prioritization process based models wepp swat 1 introduction water quality concerns from non point source pollution nps are a challenge for land and water resources managers effective management of nps requires strategic targeting and prioritization of watershed areas for implementing best management practices bmps diebel et al 2008 such targeting and prioritization typically consist of the identification of pollutant source areas and subsequent management to reduce water quality degradation daggupati et al 2011 easton et al 2017 process based hydrology and water quality simulation models have shown the capability to evaluate the potential effects of land management and climate scenarios on water quantity and quality for example a review of various process based distributed watershed models by wellen et al 2015 reported that 83 of the reviewed scientific studies 257 published between the year 1992 and 2010 used one of these five models soil and water assessment tool swat integrated catchment model inca annualized agricultural non point source pollution model agnps annagnps hydrological simulation program fortran hspf and hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv such models can provide a link between management decisions and watershed response and provide a scientific basis for management decisions rode et al 2010 the utility of these process based models is not only to provide spatially explicit predictions of runoff and erosion but also to provide a deeper understanding of the key factors and dominant hydrologic processes and flow paths that drive the detachment and transport of sediment and associated pollutants brooks et al 2015 characteristically such models have been successfully applied predominantly by the scientific community for a management scenario oriented impact assessment on water quality and quantity to identify priority source areas and to formulate management plans for instance the utility of the swat model has been widely demonstrated in the scenario based evaluation of the efficacy of site specific bmps on water quality as well as in the targeting of bmps placement for improving water quality briak et al 2019 daggupati et al 2011 easton et al 2010 liu et al 2019 merriman et al 2019 park et al 2014 xu et al 2019 similarly the wepp model has been successfully used for guiding watershed managers in the selection and placement of the bmps in forested watersheds efta and chung 2014 robichaud et al 2007 it has also been applied for investigating the effectiveness of conservation management practices and targeted management in agricultural watersheds brooks et al 2015 pandey et al 2009 singh et al 2011 other models recognized in wellen et al 2015 were used to investigate sediment and nutrients response under alternative management scenarios as well as to identify priority areas for erosion control measures and to assess the bmps effectiveness on nutrient loading abdelwahab et al 2014 ahn and kim 2016 bastrup birk and gundersen 2004 gudino elizondo et al 2019 luo et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 despite this demonstrated usefulness the use of process based models by managers in what if scenario testing has been limited to date ease of use extensive model setup and training requirements often form barriers to the adoption and effective use of process based models in the planning process garen et al 1999 there is also a strong need to disseminate the information generated by these models to stakeholders and decision makers in a functional format the recent evolution of web based user interfaces for some models attempts to partly address these barriers for example swatonline simplifies swat data querying as well as enables simple data visualizations mcdonald et al 2019 the hydrologic and water quality system hawqs makes it easier to set up and run the swat model at the hydrologic unit codes hucs 8 to 12 or larger scale and provides users with summary visualization capabilities and the ability to download an entire project to be used on a local computer yen et al 2016 to enhance the use of process based models in informed decision making an online watershed interface weppcloud has been developed to make use of the water erosion prediction project wepp model across the us by watershed managers easier and more convenient dobre et al n d this interface was specifically developed for forestry applications as part of the forest service suite of models https forest moscowfsl wsu edu fswepp and its use recently has been extended to rangeland landscapes weppcloud rhem as well lew et al n d web based user interfaces make the models more accessible and easier to use but do not necessarily provide the data summaries and visualizations in a functional format to compare multiple watershed simulations of different management options and facilitate what if scenario testing to develop an action plan and ensure appropriate and effective management practices are implemented managers need to understand the key hydrologic drivers and factors soil type land use land cover slope and climate involved in the transport of the pollutant and the sensitivity of these factors to pollutant transport the amount of simulated output generated by process based models especially when using the model to assess multiple management options over multiple years in unique land types within a watershed can be overwhelming end user e g watershed managers would require extensive training in geospatial analysis and modeling to process the output in essence process based models are very useful tools for ingesting big data as model input however they can also generate an equal amount of big data that can be equally daunting for end users to synthesize and extract useful knowledge for identifying and spatially prioritizing bmps a multiple scenario simulation from a hillslope or hru based geospatial model for even a relatively small watershed and short daily weather time series can easily generate hundreds to thousands of targeting combinations fig 1 integrating what if scenario information with decision support tools would enable watershed managers to harness the potential of sophisticated process based models and truly aid in decision making brooks et al 2015 emphasized the need to connect science and management by improving process based planning tools such that crucial information is available to planners to target areas in the landscape brooks et al 2015 demonstrated the use of a simplified web interface consisting of post processing algorithms built on top of the wepp model to effectively support bmp assessment and planning the number of commercial and open source platforms for hosting online tools has led to an explosion in web based applications and has provided an opportunity to develop geospatial decision support tools for example tools developed using shiny an open source web application framework developed by the rstudio team r core team 2021 have enabled the creation of interactive web applications that allow users to interact dynamically with the model simulations since its inception the use of shiny has increased steadily as evidenced by peer reviewed papers through which specialists in academic fields disseminated knowledge to stakeholders kasprzak et al 2020 while shiny has been used across a diverse range of academic fields to our knowledge few peer reviewed papers in the earth and environmental sciences have used the shiny web application framework for instance klein et al 2017 developed the webxtreme tool to facilitate agroclimatic risk evaluation under climate change webxtreme has provided an important link between scientists and decision makers whateley et al 2015 used shiny to develop a web based decision support tool that provides an interactive environment to water managers and stakeholders to explore water supply system vulnerabilities to climate change this tool targeted at small scale water supply systems provides an opportunity for more dynamic and collaborative water resources management the objectives of this work were to develop a stand alone post processing interactive analysis and visualization tool that can ingest complex spatially distributed output from geospatial hydrologic models and to demonstrate its use as a decision support tool for scenario oriented planning and management we developed the prioritization visualization and analysis tool pi vat that synthesizes tabular and map based outputs for multiple watersheds and scenarios we demonstrate the utility of the tool with watershed case studies using outputs from two of the most well known hydrologic management models wepp and swat we describe its development and demonstrate its use in evaluating and guiding land and water resources management decisions in three watershed case studies 2 methods 2 1 interface implementation pi vat is an interactive tool developed for the identification and prioritization of pollutant hotspots and areas suitable for targeted management currently pi vat ingests output from two of the most widely used hydrologic models wepp and swat using the shiny web application framework for the r programming language beeley and sukhdeve 2018 chang et al 2021 r core team 2021 pi vat is deployed on the shinyapps io server and can be accessed at https cdeval shinyapps io pi vat the pi vat source code can be found on the github page of the tool https github com devalc pi vat pi vat requires users to have pre computed scenario runs using either online or offline wepp or swat interfaces information on summarizing and preparing multiple pre computed scenarios for use in pi vat is provided on the pi vat s github page 2 2 main interface components the pi vat interface intuitively guides the user through a what if analysis from data input to dynamic visualization fig 2 each tab on the pi vat user interface consists of two sections the input control panel and the visualization summary panel as shown in fig 3 the visualization summary panel was implemented using the r wrappers for the plotly leaflet and datatables cheng et al 2021 sievert 2020 xie et al 2021 making it fully interactive the input control panel contains four main options denoted by numbers in fig 3 namely data import options and three auto populated dropdown menus for the watershed scenario and the targeted water quality quantity metric respectively the input panel provides users with the ability to upload output files from the hydrologic model select water quality quantity metrics of interest and control visualization and data summaries by using the control buttons we specifically included synthesis products based on feedback from watershed managers for scenario testing watershed applications three of the most common suggestions are to provide the ability to i compare impacts from different management options within a single sub watershed ii identify priority watersheds or hillslopes to implement a particular management practice iii assess trade offs from the implementation of particular management practice in the first case the user needs to have the ability to visualize and compare multiple treatments in a single watershed in the second case the user needs to be able to summarize and visualize differences across unique spatial units in the third case a manager may also want to better understand the implications of management options from multiple responses e g reduced runoff and increased subsurface lateral flow to identify whether a management practice may result in a positive environmental impact from one perspective but at the cost of creating another environmental problem from another perspective in addition a manager may want to identify the most sensitive areas in the landscape which give the greatest benefit from the application of a particular management practice e g sediment reduction per unit area of the watershed treated furthermore a manager may also want to ascertain unique soil landscape and climatic characteristics that make this identified landscape area very sensitive to the particular treatment managers can also be constrained by specific regulatory policies which limit the application of practice to a specific region e g no logging timber on slopes 30 in this case the manager would like to focus the analysis on treatable areas within the watershed these management challenges are common to nearly all watershed studies brooks et al 2015 mulla et al 2008 rittenburg et al 2015 and therefore we developed the tool pi vat to address these objectives specifically pi vat provides the ability to graphically compare differences in the magnitude of a certain simulated output e g sediment yield from multiple management scenarios on a single chart heatmap bar chart for spatial analysis the tool can map these differences in simulated output between two scenarios in a particular watershed to identify watersheds sensitive to a particular management scenario pi vat also provides the option to generate charts and maps comparing the magnitude of a simulated output for a single management scenario across multiple watersheds it provides the option to select and analyze single or multiple hydrologic response output variables pi vat also provides cumulative distribution figures which display the percent of the hydrologic or pollutant response output within a watershed vs the cumulative percent area from which the pollutant was generated within the watershed users can then use slider bars to filter the output and identify the areas which contribute the greatest source loading per unit area of the watershed this is particularly useful where a manager might have limited financial resources which only allow the treatment of a small fraction of the watershed similar filter options have been implemented to narrow the analysis to a particular slope steepness range for example pi vat allows users to select and only display output from areas having a slope steepness greater than and or less than a certain minimum and or maximum slope to assist users in the identification of key factors and hydrologic drivers pi vat continuously updates downloadable output tables based on user selected options which include not only multiple output hydrologic response variables but also key soil topographic and climatic input factors 2 3 site descriptions we selected three case studies from three regions consisting of either a forest or an agricultural system lake tahoe basin california nevada palouse washington and we 38 sub watershed within the mahantango experimental watershed south central pennsylvania we selected sub watersheds in these regions based on the unique land uses and the associated land management and water quality concerns in each area we first describe the sites and in section 2 4 describe the modeling scenarios 2 3 1 lake tahoe basin lake tahoe despite being in an ultra oligotrophic state coats et al 2008 hatch et al 2001 has experienced long term declining water clarity due to upland contributions of fine sediment and phosphorus sahoo et al 2013 previous research suggests that the primary productivity of the lake has been increasing by about 5 per year coats et al 2008 and in the last five decades the secchi depth of lake tahoe has decreased by about 10 m kerlin 2017 fire suppression in the lake tahoe basin during the 20th century has resulted in forest floor accumulation of duff and woody debris which has increased the risk of frequent and more intense wildfires miller et al 2010 land managers in the basin are interested in comparing the impacts of wildfires and timber harvest on water quality to identify sensitive areas in the landscape for targeted management in this case study we used pi vat to evaluate the effects of several forest treatments thinning and wildfire scenarios on sediment yield from multiple watersheds we considered seven watersheds with areas ranging between 4 1 km2 and 110 km2 and an average of 626 hillslopes in each watershed and a total of 11 simulated scenarios ranging from forest treatments such as thinning and prescribed fire to wildfires this amounts to 48 202 combinations of hillslopes along with the associated soils land uses and slope steepness that were evaluated for targeted management 2 3 2 palouse washington conventional tillage management on the steep hillslopes of the dryland wheat based cropping systems within the inland pacific northwest palouse region has caused excessive soil erosion aggressive tillage with low residual ground cover has left a degraded landscape it was estimated that the topsoil was completely removed from 10 of the cropland and one fourth to three fourths was lost from 60 of the region usda 1978 subsoil horizons in the region can often include dense subsoil calcium carbonate bk argillic btb and fragipan btxb soil horizons that lead to perched water tables subsurface lateral flow and saturation excess runoff processes brooks et al 2012 mcdaniel et al 2008 erosion rates can be reduced through the adoption of conservation tillage practices however the effectiveness varies by topography soil type and climate kok et al 2009 in this watershed case study we examine the effects of tillage management on the sediment yield within the thorn creek 109 km2 and kamiache creek 40 km2 watersheds located within the 381 to 457 mm mean annual precipitation zone in the palouse soil and water conservation districts are interested in incentivizing conservation tillage practices on the hillslopes which contribute the greatest benefit to the cost ratio from the treatment application these watersheds implement a three year crop rotation consisting of winter wheat spring barley summer fallow each watershed has an average of 1590 hillslopes and a total of three simulated management scenarios resulting in 9 540 combinations three types of tillage systems were compared a conventional tillage system ct with a chisel plow a minimum or mulch tillage mt scenario and a no till system nt 2 3 3 we 38 experimental sub watershed managing the transport delivery and long term legacy of excessive phosphorus loading from agriculturally dominated landscapes is a well documented challenge particularly in the eastern us with a long history of dairy operations and impacts on soil chemistry kleinman et al 2011 sharpley et al 2001 1994 stackpoole et al 2019 accurately identifying nutrient source areas dominant delivery mechanisms and the impact of management strategies on phosphorus loading is therefore an essential step to avoid long term water quality impairment in downstream water bodies we 38 is a 7 3 km2 first order upland agricultural experimental sub watershed located within the larger 420 km2 mahantango creek experimental watershed it was established in 1976 by the usda agricultural research service to better understand the water quantity and water quality implications of agriculturally based farming systems in pennsylvania and particularly for better understanding nutrient loading to chesapeake bay buda et al 2011 we 38 is known for its variable source area hydrology driven by topographic variability and perched water tables over fragipan subsoil horizons bryant et al 2011 in the case of the we 38 sub watershed we use pi vat to examine the effects of varying soil phosphorus content manure application and tillage and cropping management on phosphorus and nutrient losses collick et al 2015 we considered six sub watersheds of we 38 with a total of 1 286 hrus and eight simulated management scenarios resulting in a 10 288 combination of hrus that can be considered for targeted management 2 4 synthesis approach our synthesis approach demonstrates the application of pi vat for multi watershed multi scenario simulated results from wepp and swat with a focus on targeting and prioritizing management we demonstrate the utility of the tool rather than assess the accuracy or validate the model predictions because several previous validation studies already have shown the accuracy of wepp boll et al 2015 brooks et al 2016 elliot et al 2015 srivastava et al 2020 srivastava et al 2017 and swat collick et al 2015 easton et al 2010 2009 xu et al 2019 model predictions to demonstrate the utility of pi vat we used wepp model output for the lake tahoe and palouse case studies generated using the weppcloud interface for the lake tahoe test case we considered the current conditions curcond scenario as the baseline scenario and for the palouse test case we considered conventional till ct as the baseline scenario for the we 38 case study we used swat vsa model output easton et al 2008 and considered the high rate spring surface manure application scenario as the baseline scenario in the synthesis from the target combinations described in each case study we respond to land and water resources managers desires to be able to identify which watershed and hillslopes to prioritize and what treatment management to implement to minimize water quality impacts in the synthesis approach we answer the following general targeting questions aimed at addressing the unique water quality problem in each case study described before a which watersheds are a major concern with respect to the pollutant of concern b how sensitive is this watershed to the disturbances and changes in management practices c what amount of the watershed needs to be treated to reduce the loading of the pollutant of concern d where are these source areas located in the watershed how do they compare to the baseline scenario what are the general driving factors in these areas 3 results 3 1 lake tahoe basin the lake tahoe basin case study presents pi vat usefulness for identifying critical source areas of sediment in forested environments with fire risk a large amount of sediment yield and soil loss from both hillslopes and channels for the baseline scenario emerges from the blackwood creek watershed 41 followed by the ward creek watershed 20 fig 4 a b the sediment yield and soil loss are generally larger in the cases of fire scenarios whereas these increases in the case of thinning management scenarios are comparatively small fig 4c the largest contribution of the total hillslope soil loss 54 and the sediment yield 27 across scenarios arises from the high severity highsev fire scenario fig 4d in the case of the 85 thinning scenario thin85 this contribution of total hillslope soil loss and sediment yield across scenarios amounted to 2 and 4 respectively more than 80 of the total sediment yield in the blackwood creek watershed across three different scenarios comes from only 25 of the total hillslope area fig 5 a in this 25 of the total hillslope area the cumulative sediment yield increased from the baseline scenario by 195 mg for the thinning scenario thinn85 and 1264 mg for the low severity fire scenario lowsev respectively fig 5c the relative difference in sediment yield between the comparison scenario and the baseline scenario from all hillslopes in the blackwood creek watershed fig 5b and fig 5d shows the same for the top 25 of the total hillslopes contributing maximum sediment yield table a 1 lists the top 15 hillslopes with a maximum increase in sediment yield relative to the baseline scenario for example the highest absolute increase in sediment yield 25191 kg ha 1 compared to the baseline scenario occurs from hillslope 2211 which is characterized as a melody rock outcrop soil and an average slope steepness of 42 table a 1 for each of these top 25 contributing hillslopes supplemental table a 3 lists the sediment yield from the comparison scenario and its relative change from the baseline scenario along with the land use soil characteristics and slope description approximately 85 of these hillslopes have a steepness greater than 30 and the majority of these soils are rock outcrop complexes or sandy loam soils 3 2 palouse the palouse case study presents pi vat usefulness for identifying critical source areas of sediment of agricultural basins under different tillage intensities relatively large soil losses from both hillslopes and channels for the baseline scenario occur in the thorn creek watershed whereas relatively large sediment yield occurs from the kamiache creek watershed fig 6 a pi vat visuals indicated that the majority of the sediment yield in the region 67 was generated from the kamiache creek watershed with a much smaller percentage 33 generated from the thorn creek watershed fig 6b when compared across different management scenarios the relative sediment yield and soil loss from the kamiache creek watershed occurs in the following order ct mt nt fig 6c the largest contribution 40 of the total hillslope soil loss and the sediment yield across scenarios arises from the ct practices fig 6d whereas the smallest contribution 25 of the total hillslope soil loss and the sediment yield across scenarios arises from the nt practices fig 6d about 80 85 of the total sediment yield in the kamiache creek watershed across the three different scenarios comes from only 15 of the total hillslope area fig 7 a in this 15 of the total hillslope area the cumulative sediment yield decreased by about 6 mg and 11 5 mg by switching from ct to mt and nt management practices respectively fig 7c fig 7b shows the relative difference in sediment yield between the comparison scenario and the baseline scenario from all the hillslopes in the kamiache creek watershed and fig 7d shows the same for the top 15 of the total hillslopes contributing maximum sediment yield table a 2 lists the top 15 hillslopes with a maximum increase in sediment yield relative to the baseline scenario the highest absolute increase of 4 08 kg ha 1 from the baseline scenario occurs at hillslope 23 which has an average slope steepness of 17 and chard silt loam soil table a 2 supplemental table a 4 lists the sediment yield from the comparison scenario and its relative change from the baseline scenario for these top 15 of the total contributing hillslopes generally soil erosion increased with slope steepness and slope length and was greatest where conventional tillage practices were employed in winter wheat spring barley summer fallow rotations in chard silt loams which have dense calcium carbonate bk horizon at 90 cm below the soil surface 3 3 we 38 the pi vat analysis of we 38 indicates a phosphorus response to management which is sensitive to treatment and the form of the phosphorus transported mineral and organic phosphorus kg transported with water out of the reach decreases in the following reach order number 6 1 2 3 4 5 fig 8 a however when normalized by the area of each subbasin the largest transport of mineral p attached to the sediment and soluble p into the reach occurs from subbasin 3 in the business as usual scenario fig 8b and d also for the same scenario the amount of mineral p attached to the sediment transported into the reach decreases by subbasin in the following subbasin order number 3 6 5 2 4 1 and for the transport of soluble p decreases by the subbasin order number 3 1 4 2 5 6 fig 8b and d the highest mineral phosphorus 20 and organic phosphorus 18 transported through stream reach 3 compared across all the scenarios occur for the business as usual scenario whereas adopting a low rate spring injection manure application method the mineral phosphorus and organic phosphorus transport through stream reach 3 reduces to 8 and 11 respectively reductions in organic a sediment b and soluble c phosphorus losses from corn silage land within subbasin 3 by converting from business as usual manure application methods to the high rate spring injection method are displayed in fig 9 the reduction in phosphorus transport from an alternative or comparison management option scenario relative to a baseline scenario along with the specific land use soil type and slope descriptions for organic sediment and soluble phosphorus output responses are listed in supplemental tables a 5 a 7 respectively 4 discussion in each of the case studies pi vat was able to ingest large output files from multiple watersheds for multiple management scenarios synthesis results very clearly identify not only the greatest hydrologic response to treatment but also where the pollutant was generated the type of pollutant which was most sensitive and knowledge on key factors and characteristics soil type or topographic of the most sensitive landscape positions this type of scenario comparison and detailed synthesis is cumbersome as these hydrologic models are developed to provide output for one scenario at a time comparison of multiple scenarios in wepp for example often requires a user to upload output files into spreadsheets or use programming languages such as r which is very time consuming and complicated for typical land managers who would like this type of comparative analysis pi vat significantly reduced the time and complexity of such comparative analyses allowing the managers to carry out the what if analysis in a matter of minutes in all three case studies we saw that the effectiveness of management practices was not equal across a landscape suggesting that targeted management strategies rather than blanketed management would be successful and will likely be cost effective this is a well known and documented finding for large watershed management studies walter et al 2000 here however we showed that pi vat can quickly visualize this using modeling output especially when a land manager may be trying to convince stakeholders and investors of implementing a targeted management approach not only was pi vat able to show where targeted responses to management will occur in these watersheds but the tool also quickly provided the location and characteristics of the targeted locations as well as the hydrologic responses in the dominant hydrologic flow paths in particular for we 38 we see that the phosphorus response to treatment varied by the delivered form of phosphorus pi vat was able to show that this varied response by the delivered form of phosphorus was also associated with the hydrologic pathways for instance the spatial patterns of sediment bound phosphorus were similar to that of the runoff from the hrus we demonstrated using pi vat that comparative visualization and analysis can help identify pollutant source areas for prioritizing targeted management for all three cases pi vat s comparative analysis was able to directly identify locations in the landscape where the greatest relative unit decrease in the response of the pollutant of concern occurred from the application of different management practices for example generally in the lake tahoe and palouse analysis we found that specific soil types with restrictive soil horizons were often the most sensitive to treatments in the lake tahoe case study land types characterized as having steep slopes with rock outcrops and gravelly sandy loam soils had the potential to generate high to very high surface runoff in addition these land types were often identified as landscape positions having the greatest sensitivity to alternative management practices given the abundance of process based hydrology and water quality models coupled with the increased use of data driven analytics the broader opportunities for the hydrologic community to integrate models with decision tools are vast and yet unrealized guswa et al 2014 such integration would enable land and water resources managers to harness the potential of these sophisticated models in decision making with the three case studies we demonstrated the potential utility of pi vat as a standalone tool in bridging the barriers in the use of two commonly employed sophisticated hydrology and water quality models wepp and swat for management prioritization by making the results available to managers in an interactive and functional format pi vat has the potential to assist watershed managers in using the physically based models more regularly alongside their current planning process and effectively communicating the implications of proposed managements 5 conclusions land and water resources managers are interested in the optimal use of conservation dollars to protect water resources from nps sediments nutrients and other water quality issues associated with land management practices this requires identifying prioritizing and targeting critical source areas for implementing conservation management practices process based models that account for the relevant physical processes are powerful tools and can be effective for prioritization and targeted watershed management provided the outputs from these models are made available to the managers in a more functional format we demonstrate the use of pi vat to interactively identify quantify and visualize the areas that are most susceptible to disturbance and change in management we provide a synthesis approach based on land use soil type and slope steepness such that the synthesized data and visuals can aid managers in identifying watersheds subbasins of concern evaluating the sensitivity of these watersheds subbasins to land management practices quantifying and isolating source areas for treatment management and understanding factors driving hydrologic and water quality response we demonstrate the utility of pi vat in facilitating a better understanding of the critical pollution source areas and in devising an action plan the simplicity and accessibility of this web based interactive tool along with compatibility to process both wepp and swat based outputs can greatly support watershed planning using complex process based models the tool was developed such that it can be potentially quickly modified to ingest output from any model that can provide tabular files from spatial modeling units represented by geospatial maps and therefore has the potential to be widely adopted as a decision support tool for multiple

3613,daily precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature series are homogenised over the lake chad basin between 1979 and 2020 using two conceptually different homogenisation methods the adapted caussinus mestre algorithm for homogenising networks of temperature series acmant and the iterated standard normal homogeneity climatol results show the existence of unnatural breakpoints for most of the station series however the two methods show a general improvement in the quality of climate series the trend estimation of the homogenised series based on the modified mann kendall methodology shows different modifications of the trend s magnitude for different periods overall climatol and acmant exhibit nearly similar trend patterns suggesting the credibility of both homogenisation methods relative to the base period of analysis 1981 2010 the anomaly classification for the entire basin between 1979 and 2020 into dry warm wet warm dry cold and wet cold are misrepresented by the raw series compared to the homogenised series such erroneous representations resulting from inhomogeneities in raw climate series could misinform decisions akin to climate change assessment and water resources management strategies thereby reducing the adaptive capability of the basin s inhabitants to climate change effects our study demonstrates the importance of robust homogenisation of climate series to mitigate inhomogeneity errors and improve the quality of information when observations are used in climate and hydrological studies keywords trend climatol acmant homogenisation climate

homogeneity test ita innovative trend analysis 1 introduction in the past years there has been an increase in the occurrence of climate extreme events these have been attributed to climate change ornes 2018 bellprat et al 2019 according to ipcc 2021 the rise in air temperature has exacerbated global warming issues for a reliable climate change and variability study it is vital to detect and correct inhomogeneities in the observed time series venema et al 2012 adeyeri et al 2019a aguilar et al 2003 this is also important when observations are used to estimate future climate scenarios laapas and venäläinen 2017 inhomogeneities in climate time series could incorporate biases and spurious trends leading to erroneous result interpretations mamara et al 2013 adeyeri et al 2017 della marta et al 2004 emphasised that the extent of these biases is of the same magnitude as the investigated climate change or variability indicators therefore climate time series must be homogenous i e the variations in the time series must be only from weather and climate variations peterson et al 1998 however various non climatic influences such as relocation of stations changes in observed practices instrumentation and recalibration changes have rendered most climate series unreliable for the actual climate variations peterson et al 1998 other factors include land use change different homogenisation methods have been developed and used to detect and correct inhomogeneities in climate series all over the world alexandersson 1986 ducré robitaille et al 2003 domonkos and coll 2017 fioravanti et al 2019 adeyeri et al 2019a guijarro 2018 domonkos 2011 pérez zanón et al 2015 mamara et al 2013 adeyeri et al 2020a some methods homogenise climate series in the individual station using the hierarchical structures alexandersson and moberg 1997 others correct inhomogeneity jointly on a series of participating stations using suitable mathematical methods lindau and venema 2016 domonkos and coll 2017 domonkos 2021 adeyeri et al 2019b joint homogenisation domonkos and coll 2017 is preferable to the hierarchic approach especially when several breaks are present in the climate series conversely methods that rely on non stationarity checks of single climatological series beaulieu et al 2009 are based on the impractical hypothesis of a stable climate guijarro 2018 also it is impossible to separate inhomogeneity from climate change signals using this approach szentimrey et al 2014 therefore relative homogenisation approaches whose stationarity checks are examined across the candidate series and one or more well correlated neighbour series are preferable guijarro 2018 mamara et al 2013 homogenised greece s mean monthly temperature time series using the multiple analysis of series for homogenization mash and climatol from 1960 to 2004 they reported that the homogenisation methods improved data series spatial and temporal consistencies for an improved climate variability study fioravanti et al 2019 homogenised daily maximum and minimum temperatures for italy between 1961 and 2017 using acmant and climatol they stated that both methods detected non climatic discontinuities in the data series the results agree with mamara et al 2013 emphasising an improved spatial coherence in the homogenised data series while the trends show more accurate and consistent climatic patterns finally azorin molina et al 2019 homogenised daily peak wind gusts for australia between 1941 and 2016 using climatol the results show that the method corrects inconsistent data while filling in all missing values of the essential climate variables precipitation and temperature mainly were used to develop and evaluate different methods in these studies although precipitation and temperature changes in a river basin influence river discharge limitations such as spatial and temporal coverage climate series inhomogeneities regional forcing and differences impose various uncertainties on hydrometeorological studies huntington 2006 adeyeri et al 2019a the lake chad basin lcb is characterised by rainfall and temperature variability the repeated drought episodes and more recently flooding events resulting from the partial rainfall recovery in the sahel have been of concern to policymakers and inhabitants of the basin adeyeri et al 2019a funk et al 2010 thompson and polet 2000 this variability is not limited to the lcb other river basins in the tropical and subtropical regions are faced with this condition moron et al 2008 ngarukiyimana et al 2018 laux et al 2020 although adeyeri et al 2019a corrected the inhomogeneities in some climate series in the komadugu yobe basin kyb which is a sub basin of the lcb from 1971 to 2013 using acmant version 3 1 the reliability of the homogenised climate series was not established domonkos and coll 2017 emphasised that this method is more reliable in places with high stations density and spatial correlation between individual climate stations in contrast the climate stations distribution in the sub basin is limited and the effect of station density was not assessed in adeyeri et al 2019a however investigating inhomogeneities using different homogenisation methods give more reliable and robust results begert et al 2005 štěpánek et al 2009 fioravanti et al 2019 given this this study homogenised three daily meteorological variables i e precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature data series over the lcb from 1979 to 2020 using two different approaches even though the two approaches are classified as relative homogenisation techniques the break detection methods are conceptually distinct acmant automatically determines breakpoints based on the climatic features of the study region variable type and temporal resolution on the other hand climatol detects breaks subjectively based on two different parameterisation schemes i e the snht thresholds and normalisation subsequently the homogenisation effects on the trend and some selected climate indices were considered due to the lack of stations metadata inhomogeneities in the data series may not ascertain the actual climate signal discontinuity hence the efficiency of the two homogenisation approaches is not considered but the results from the two approaches were compared to establish the reliability of the homogenised outputs however it is expected that the raw series s quality will improve after homogenisation therefore this study advanced on previous studies in the basin due to the availability of more stations the use of a new acmant algorithm and the application of an additional algorithm to verify the robustness of the homogenised results subsequently contributes to the overall understanding of inhomogeneities in climate series on the trend of meteorological variables and extreme climate events in the basin 2 geographical information and data 2 1 geographical information the lcb is a sedimentary groundwater basin encompassing eight african countries with an elevation between 154 and 3412 m the size is about 2 400 000 km2 fig 1 which approximates 8 of the entire african landmass fortnam and oguntola 2004 lake chad is situated in the southern part of the sahara desert in the lcb this lake is principally fed by the chari logone komadugu gana and the komadugu yobe river sub systems these river systems with the associated wetlands enhance diverse commercial activities e g fish production pastoralism trading and ecological activities e g forest regeneration recession agriculture ecosystem preservation currently the survival of over 38 million people hinges on these activities being carried out in the basin iucn 2011 giz 2015 the significant water loss in the basin is by evaporation and infiltration three climatic zones are found in this basin to the north is the saharan desert climate to the south is the sudan climate accompanied by a hot wet and dry season to the centre is the sahelian climate with wet and dry seasons giz 2015 the dominant wind system i e the south easterly monsoon wind gathers moisture from the atlantic ocean inland in the wet season heavy rains accompany this the dominant north easterly wind gathers dust from the sahara desert down to the south in the dry season this is accompanied by harmattan dust haze and dryness warner 2004 the basin is characterised by high rainfall variability and recurrent drought thompson and polet 2000 giz 2015 the recurrence and severity of drought often leave the communities in this basin susceptible thereby reducing their adaptive capacity to climate change adeyeri et al 2019b before the drought events this basin had contributed significant water volume to lake chad however these drought events have caused significant changes to the environmental structure and hydrology of the basin this subsequently affects agriculture livestock and fish production giz 2015 also regional climate change and unsuitable water management practices have altered the seasonal river flow thereby reducing water flow in the basin iucn 2011 adeyeri et al 2020b this has considerably reduced the water inflow into lake chad henceforward contributing to the reduction of lake chad over the last four decades iucn 2011 giz 2015 on the other hand the recent flood events have threatened the socio economic well being lives and properties of people living in the basin adeyeri et al 2020b therefore to efficiently understand the climate instability in the basin reliable climate variability and climate change studies must be carried out using accurate climate data series 2 2 data daily meteorological data series precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature archived by the direction de la meteorologie nationale dmn nigeria meteorological agency nimet and the trans african hydrometeorological observatory tahmo were used for the analysis although some of the stations from the above institutions have few data series incomplete data over the analysis period were obtained from other external databases to complete the climate series up to 2020 due to the various data formats and sources the various stations were examined based on the metadata provided to identify repeated stations in some cases the metadata is not available to ascertain the correctness of the station names and properties from the different data sources in this case duplicated stations were harmonised according to their elevation and distance fioravanti et al 2019 station pairs within the radius of 500 m altitude and 2 km apart were initially inspected based on the similarities in their names using the levenshtein distance metric fick and hijmans 2017 3 methods erroneous climate data could lead to false trends inhomogeneities reduced cross correlation between station pairs reduced homogenisation performance biased climate extremes statistics and a completely wrong interpretation in climate analysis it is therefore imperative to quality control climate data series heim 2015 adeyeri et al 2017 domonkos and coll 2017 hunziker et al 2017 fioravanti et al 2019 gbode et al 2019 therefore due to the various sources of the daily climate series they were subjected to two levels of quality control 1 in the first level temporal consistency days with maximum temperature lesser than minimum temperature outliers negative precipitation values and other basic integrity checks were inspected and corrected 2 the spatial consistency of each time series was assessed for the neighbouring stations much closer stations outside the basin were also considered for this hunziker et al 2018 after the preprocessing steps complete climate series were obtained from 1979 to 2020 for 45 stations table 1 3 1 homogenisation detecting non climatic breaks in climate series can be done using different statistical tests in this study two relative homogenisation approaches were considered in a relative homogenisation approach individual participating climate series are checked against one or many reference climate series representatives in the study region fioravanti et al 2019 mamara et al 2013 guijarro 2018 the relative homogeneity approaches used in this study are acmant and climatol several studies domonkos 2011 mamara et al 2013 lindau and venema 2013 domonkos and coll 2017 chimani et al 2018 azorin molina et al 2019 fioravanti et al 2019 adeyeri et al 2019b adeyeri et al 2019a have documented the effectiveness of these methods in homogenising climate series in acmant the inhomogeneity detection incorporates a weighted reference while data breaks numbers in climate series are optimised using the caussinus lyazrhi criterion caussinus and lyazrhi 1997 the optimal step function fitting minimises the internal distance variance while maximising the external distance variance venema et al 2012 domonkos and coll 2017 the shift in annual means is identified using bivariate detection technique as described below domonkos and coll 2017 1 m i n j 1 j 2 j k k 0 k i j k 1 j k 1 d v 1 k i 2 c d v k i 2 the internal distance d is specified as 2 d v i v q i v q k w h

j is the year gp is a parameter and xe is an ensemble homogenisation serial number the weighted average of the anomalies in the partner series is calculated and subsequently adjusted to the candidate series climatic mean to fill the missing values in the candidate series the full report on the acmant method is presented in domonkos and coll 2017 due to the location of the study area the irregular seasonality model from the acmant 4 3 version was used for homogenisation domonkos 2019 2021 conversely there were three stages involved when homogenising with climatol stage 1 applies the standard normal homogeneity test snht originally developed by alexandersson 1986 based on stepped overlapping temporal windows of the climate series consequently the climate series are split according to the breaks instead of applying snht on overlapping temporal windows stage 2 runs it through the entire time series stage 3 fills the missing data by calculating the weighted ratios of the homogenous series of the nearby stations the details are presented in guijarro 2018 using ward s agglomerative clustering method ward 1963 the raw climate series was divided into different homogenous groups clusters for a reliable homogeneity assessment fig s1 subsequently more prominent cluster pairs were derived from merging the cluster pairs with minimum distance lastly the cluster s dendrogram was used to determine the clustering partition based on the clusters ranked results furthermore two different parameterisation schemes i e the snht thresholds and normalisation were adopted for this study the rates to the mean normalisation approach were used for precipitation because it has natural zeroes with a skewed probability distribution in contrast standardised normalisation was used for the temperature variables although snht thresholds have been established for different lengths of series as well as at different levels of significance e g khaliq and ouarda 2007 it is however important to subjectively adopt or compare these values depending on the climate variable as well as the extent of the correlation between series and the temporal frequency guijarro 2018 bearing this in mind the snht thresholds were set subjectively after exploring the different histograms of anomalies and histograms of maximum snht outputs for different climatol iterations 40 iterations in total consequently the variables were homogenised on a daily scale due to the unavailability of metadata the credibility of the homogenised data series was assessed using the anomaly and trends estimation 3 2 trends and spatial interpolation the homogenised climate series was subjected to the modified mann kendall mmk trend test yue and wang 2004 adeyeri et al 2017 ahmed et al 2020a oyerinde et al 2021 and the innovative trend analysis ita şen 2017 wang et al 2020 şen 2012 the magnitude of the trend was established using sen s estimator sen 1968 ahmed et al 2020b adeyeri and ishola 2021 besides establishing monotonic trends and trend significance the change magnitude and length of change occurrence also have different consequences and effects on the management and planning of water resources to characterise the trend patterns the ita method was adopted the ita method splits data time series into two halves before sorting both halves in ascending order the first xi and the second half yi of the series are plotted on a cartesian coordinate system on the horizontal and vertical axes respectively a no trend line that splits the decreasing and the increasing trends is represented by the 1 1 line on the coordinate system there exists a monotonic decreasing increasing trend when the scatter points from the series fall below above the no trend line if there are different trends in the series the data series is categorised into two clusters namely high and low clusters şen 2012 the trend slope s in ita is calculated as 6 s 2 y 2 y 1 n where n is the number of data and y 1 and y 2 are the arithmetic averages of the second and the first halves of the dependent variable y sequence the centroid point for each cluster is the arithmetic average of the two halves that falls on the data line if the critical value scr is greater than s then the trend is not significant otherwise there is a significant trend since y 1 and y 2 are stochastic variables the first order moment e of s is calculated 7 e s 2 n e y 2 e y 1 if e y 2 e y 1 the centroid point falls on the 1 1 line indicating no trend otherwise the variance of the slope as a result of the difference between the moments is given as α s 2 e s 2 e 2 s 4 n 2 e y 2 2 2 e y 2 y 1 e y 1 2 this is the second order moment of the slope considering that e y 2 2 e y 1 2 8 α s 2 8 n 2 e y 2 2 e y 2 y 1 8 n 2 α 2 n 1 γ y 2 y 1 where γ y 2 y 1 is the coefficient of correlation between the two mean values which is given as γ y 2 y 1 e y 2 y 1 e y 2 e y 1 α y 1 α y 2 subsequently the confidence limit cl of the trend slope of a standard normal probability distribution function with zero mean and standard deviation scr is given as cl 1 β 0 scr αs where αs is the slope s standard deviation β is the significance level thus the cl line is situated above and below the no trend line details of this method are presented in şen 2017 2012 the cluster analysis for the trend follows lloyd s algorithm celebi 2015 lloyd 1982 everitt et al 2001 subsequently to investigate the trends over multiple periods the trend over moving periods of various lengths rasmus et al 2015 is analysed for the study period in this approach the y and x axes denote the length of each period and the respective starting points in addition statistically significant trends were marked with black boxes the advantage of this method lies in its ability to illustrate trends over several time scales taking into account every peculiarity in trend from the starting to the ending period therefore the moving period trend analysis is more detailed than the single period trend estimation additionally the effects of homogeneity on the trends in climate extreme indices and anomalies were examined furthermore the areal mean basin s precipitation and temperature variables are estimated using the thiessen polygon approach thissen 1911 yamada 2017 and station averaging respectively subsequently the anomaly classification of the areal mean variables was assessed royé 2020 ruane and mcdermid 2017 laux et al 2021 4 results in this section the results for the homogenisation processes are presented the comparison between climatol and acmant outputs were evaluated using different statistics based on the consistency of the results using the two homogenisation approaches the improvements of the homogenous outputs over the raw originally observed climate series was shown finally the effect of inhomogeneities on the trends of extreme events was examined 4 1 breakpoint detection the first step is to identify breaks in the climate series fig 2 shows the number of breaks for each station and each variable some series successfully passed the homogeneity test for the total number of breaks the maximum temperature series record 59 and 69 breaks for climatol and acmant respectively while minimum temperature has 71 and 78 breaks for climatol and acmant respectively the precipitation series has 23 and 26 breaks for climatol and acmant respectively due to the lack of station metadata the causes of the breakpoints could not be accurately ascertained however the breakpoints especially in goure and jos could be attributed to the change in station location and instrument recalibration respectively the breakpoints in katsina are induced by a shift in the exposure of the measurement devices because of landcover changes 4 2 statistical summary the seasonal statistical summary of the basin s series fig 3 shows the different series distribution especially in the seasonal series for all variables each density curve s breadth correlates to each area s estimated frequency of data points the peaks troughs and tails of each density curve are compared to determine any similarities or discrepancies in the series a broad density curve indicates a high frequency of values in that range in contrast a narrow density curve shows a low occurrence of values in that range generally the properties mentioned earlier are different for each variable at different timescales for example the annual maximum temperature shows different magnitudes of underestimation especially in the different quantiles compared to the acmant and climatol series also the density curve for the raw series differs considerably from the homogenised series subsequently the changes in the mean between the raw and the homogenised series are calculated at a 95 confidence level results show significant changes in mean for all variables except for the mean difference between the raw and homogenised series of annual maximum temperature as well as the annual minimum temperature series between climatol and the raw series which are not statistically significant fig s2 shows the comparison between the correlation coefficient and stations distance for daily maximum air temperature and precipitation considering ten sampled series there is an overall improvement in the correlation distance map for the homogenised series however the climatol homogenised series perform better in both cases moreover a lower correlation is possible when the distance between the stations is more as in this study furthermore the temporal distribution of the mean annual anomaly for the entire basin between 1979 and 2020 is presented in fig 4 while there are some similarities in the distribution of anomaly for all series it is noteworthy that some years are classified differently in the raw series compared to the homogenised series for example the year 1999 is classified as a wet cold year with anomalies 0 4 c mean temperature and 30 relative precipitation anomaly in the raw series while this is the same for the homogenised series except for the mean temperature anomalies which are 0 6 c in both cases furthermore 1986 is classified as dry warm in the raw series with 0 5 c mean temperature anomaly and 9 relative precipitation anomaly however this is different for both acmant and climatol homogenised series dry cold 0 5 c and 5 5 dry cold 0 2 c and 6 respectively also the year 1990 is classified as dry warm but with different anomaly magnitudes for the raw series the temperature anomaly is 0 6 c as against 0 7 c for both acmant and climatol series the year 2006 is classified as a dry and cold year for the raw series however it is classified as a dry and warm year for the homogenised series other years which are misclassified by the raw series are 1995 and 2000 4 3 trends 4 3 1 variables and associated extremes to assess the effect of homogenisation on variable trends the mmk multiple period trend and ita methodology are adopted and the results are presented in this section based on the mmk methodology figs 5 and 6 present the trends in some climate extreme indices on the station scale between 1979 and 2020 there are different modifications to the trend s magnitude and direction for the different series for example in fig 5i there is a significant decreasing trend 95 confidence level in the raw average daily wet day rainfall intensity in ngaoundere cameroon see fig 1 for station location however there is a significant increasing trend of more than 0 5 mm days decade for the homogenised series the overall magnitude range of the negative trend in the raw series is between 0 1 and 1 5 mm days decade compared to the homogenised series 0 1 to 1 8 mm days decade nevertheless the behaviour of the specific station based magnitude is mixed for example the trend in goure niger has an increasing trend 0 5 mm days decade in the raw series however the homogenised series has a decreasing trend of 0 1 mm days decade for the tropical nights fig 5 ii most series have significant increasing trends but the raw series overall magnitude ranges from 3 to 34 days decade doubling the homogenised series 2 17 days decade for the trend in the days that contribute to cold and heatwave fig 6 most stations in the raw series show a decreasing trend in the days that contribute to cold wave fig 6i yet the homogenised series have more stations with increasing trends the magnitude of the trend for the raw series varies from 8 to 3 days decade while that of the homogenised series varies from 3 to 13 days decade moreover not all series agree with the significant trends all series exhibit increasing trends for the days that contribute to heatwave frequency fig 6 ii although with an underestimation in the raw series additionally it should be noted that the days that contribute to both cold and heatwave is defined by the excess cold factor ecf and excess heat factor ehf respectively nairn and fawcett 2013 when a coldwave is in effect the ecf is negative ecf is high when a three day period is much colder than the previous 30 days i e a three day average daily temperature below the fifth percentile positive ecf levels indicate that a coldwave is not in process results from the multiple period trends for the basin average fig 7 show differences in the magnitude and trend significance for the moving periods for example there is a slight overestimation of the increasing annual precipitation trend between 1981 and 2011 in the raw series 0 20 mm decade compared to the homogenised series 0 10 mm decade the raw series also shows some statistically significant decreasing trends not observed in the homogenised series particularly in the raw series when observing from 1985 from the origin in the y direction there is a significant 99 confidence level decreasing trend for the next six years after 1985 which is not captured in the homogenised series nonetheless the overall trend properties are replicated in the homogenised series with different magnitudes and significance there is a general increase in the maximum and minimum temperature trends but with different significance and magnitudes for all series for example the homogenised maximum temperature series detect more significant increasing trends than the raw series therefore the raw series underestimate the trends in general the significant trends in both homogenised series are similar for minimum temperature the raw series detects more significant increasing trends although the trend magnitudes are overestimated in the raw series such misrepresentation in the raw series could lead to unreliable climate analysis thereby aggravating errors in hydrological studies fig 8 presents the results of the ita for the basin average it is noteworthy that the temperature increased for both raw and homogenised series however magnitudes vary the significant 99 confidence level trend is situated in the purple lines for the maximum temperature the magnitude of the increasing trend in the low temperature cluster is 0 3 0 5 and 0 6 c decade for the raw climatol and acmant series respectively however none of the trends is significant likewise the magnitude of the increasing trend of the entire temperature cluster is 0 2 0 3 and 0 3 c decade for the raw climatol and acmant series respectively in this case the raw series is statistically significant furthermore the low temperature duration in all series is identical for the raw and acmant series additionally a high cluster of temperature series means high temperature the trend in the high temperature cluster for the homogenised series is 0 3 c decade and 0 2 c decade for the raw series here all trends are significant the magnitude of the increasing trend in the low temperature cluster is overestimated by the raw series 0 7 c decade for the minimum temperature however none of the series exhibits significant trends for this cluster the increasing trend continues for the high temperature cluster with the raw and acmant series having the magnitude of 0 4 c decade while the climatol series has 0 3 c decade it is worth noting that the trend in the cluster of low temperature is higher than that of the high temperature cluster for all series there are non significant trends of 0 2 c decade for the entire minimum temperature cluster for the raw and homogenised series this contradicts adeyeri et al 2019a who stated that minimum temperature increases in the sub basin at the rate of 0 05 c year moreover this is incomparable because they considered climate series for different periods 1971 2013 and spatial extent additionally both raw and acmant series have more duration of low temperature while the raw series has the most high temperature period besides the trends the time series of some selected indices were also examined to understand the similarity in the series s annual climatology fig 9 shows a good level of similarity between the acmant and climatol time series for all the indices for example the raw series underestimated the growing degree days by up to 10 0days in 2010 while in 2012 it is up to 6 0days in addition there are some similarities between the raw and homogenised series in general the raw series underestimates indices magnitude nevertheless the zoom plots show apparent differences and similarities in the magnitudes specifically between 2005 and 2020 4 3 2 effect of homogenisation on climate extremes to examine the effect of homogenisation on the trend of climate extremes a joint sector specific climate indices et sci and the expert teams on climate change detection and indices etccdi were considered table 2 klein tank et al 2009 perkins and alexander 2013 zhang et al 2011 alexander and herold 2015 alexander et al 2018 nairn and fawcett 2013 these trends were calculated based on the mmk approach at a 95 confidence level the result shows various underestimations and overestimations observed by the raw and homogenised series table 3 even though both acmant and climatol have similar trends in most indices fourteen indices are statistically significant for climatol while thirteen are statistically significant for acmant and the raw series since each series was uniquely generated based on different homogeneity algorithms and this particular analysis is done on the areal scale the various positive and negative compensations resulting from station averaging may likely cause the differences in the number of significant indices in both homogenised series specifically the daily temperature range dtr trends are 0 15 0 03 and 0 05 c decade for raw climatol and acmant respectively although all trends are significant it is worth noting that the raw series underestimated the dtr trend negative positive dtr trends indicate an increase decrease in both maximum and minimum temperature with the minimum temperature having an increased reduced warming rate therefore the raw series shows an overestimation of the warming rate additionally the fraction of total wet day rainfall that comes from very wet days r95ptot is underestimated by the raw series 2 35 while climatol and acmant recorded 2 82 and 2 8 respectively the trend in the growing degree days is slightly underestimated by the raw series 62 94 days decade as against 65 31 days decade for climatol and 65 06 days decade for acmant all series have positive heatwave amplitude as defined by the excess heat factor the heatwave with the highest heatwave magnitude however the raw series underestimates it furthermore there is a positive trend in the number of days contributing to heatwaves defined by the 90th percentile of minimum temperature yet the raw series overestimated it nevertheless the positive or negative trends are most significant with different magnitudes for the different series also both homogenised series have similar trend magnitudes 5 discussion for a reliable climate variability and climate change assessment the quality control and subsequent homogenisation of climate data series must be executed venema et al 2012 this improves the quality of the observed dataset and subsequently improves future climate scenarios estimations made from such observed series laapas and venäläinen 2017 in this study daily precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature data series were homogenised over the lcb using acmant domonkos and coll 2017 domonkos 2021 and climatol guijarro 2018 homogenisation methods the breakpoints frequency anomaly classification and the effect of homogenisation on the trend and some selected climate indices were considered most stations considered in the study have breakpoints at different times however in all cases acmant detected more breaks than climatol in concert pérez zanón et al 2015 stated that more breaks are detected in acmant due to its sensitivity to short term biases furthermore the frequency of breakpoint occurrences as observed by both homogenisation methods was similar the average number of breaks was between 1 and 2 for the precipitation and temperature series respectively with 20 stations having one breakpoint in the precipitation series as observed by acmant this agrees with lindau and venema 2018 and fioravanti et al 2019 who stated separately that the frequency of inhomogeneities is about one in every 15 to 20 years however due to the lack of complete metadata the cause of these breaks could not be ascertained in its entirety nevertheless investigating inhomogeneities using different homogenisation methods give more reliable and robust results begert et al 2005 štěpánek et al 2009 fioravanti et al 2019 breaks in climate series could be caused by urbanisation paeth et al 2009 reduction increment in forest cover and anthropogenic activities birch 2014 changes in observed practices instrumentation and recalibration changes peterson et al 1998 additionally there was an overall improvement in the spatial consistency of the homogenised data series using the correlation distance approach a lower correlation could be ascribed to the considerable distance between the stations in the study area additionally a high correlation coefficient depicts a consistent homogenised data series and portrays an adequate missing data infilling process other causes of low correlation include differences in geographical properties e g topography which modulates precipitation regimes guijarro 2018 also based on the anomaly classification for the entire basin between 1979 and 2020 into dry warm wet warm dry cold and wet cold there were some misrepresentations of these classifications by the raw series compared to the homogenised series these misrepresentations could affect the proper management of water resources in the basin for example it could influence the regulations on water use lake ecology and hydrology flooding and future lake management options furthermore there were differences in the magnitude and direction of trends especially for the station based climate indices in general the results from the two homogenisation approaches were consistent there was a visible increment in the annual precipitation trend at some periods after drought episodes for the entire study period this may be attributed to the partial rainfall recovery in the sahel in general funk et al 2010 and the basin in particular adeyeri et al 2019a there were more positive trends for the temperature series for both raw and homogenised series this may be ascribed to the increasing temperature of the mediterranean and the north atlantic ocean funk et al 2010 and global climate change ipcc 2021 to efficiently and effectively manage water resources it is crucial to know the nature of trends occurrences after identifying them hence trend characterisation and categorisation are essential for the categorisation of trends there were differences in the magnitude and significance of the increasing trend in the temperature cluster for all series most importantly the magnitude of the significantly increasing trend of the high temperature cluster was similar for both homogenised series while it was different for the raw series however the magnitude of the significantly increasing trend of the entire temperature cluster agrees with a previous study in the kyb by adeyeri et al 2019a who stated that the maximum temperature increases in the basin at the rate of 0 03 c year from 1971 to 2013 while using acmant notably the results advanced on adeyeri et al 2019a due to the availability of more stations the use of a new acmant algorithm and an additional method to verify the robustness of the homogenised results in addition the improved data quality resulting from homogenisation using a different acmant algorithm and the climatol homogenisation approaches were also compared also as the trend of high temperature increases the hydrological cycle is intensified leading to wetter rain seasons or dryer dry seasons subsequently frequent floods or drought furthermore increased temperature increases the severity of heavy precipitation by increasing atmospheric moisture which drives the precipitation event through moisture convergence at low altitudes trenberth and shea 2005 berg et al 2009 it was established that the temperature in the basin is increasing this could result in more hydrometeorological extreme conditions in floods and drought occurrences mall et al 2006 indeed there have been flooding incidents in the kyb due to the significant precipitation intensity and subsequent runoff adeyeri et al 2019a this could severely affect the quantity and quality of available and accessible water besides crop yields may decline adeyeri et al 2019a and specific ecosystems may go extinct schindler 1997 melaku melese 2016 swenson and baldwin 1965 likewise the precipitation regime is altered affecting the timing and magnitude of river discharge additionally high temperature influences water chemistry and electrical conductivity biases arising from inhomogeneities could provide misguided information in developing desirable climate adaptation and mitigation strategies that will affect good energy planning and management i e effective ways to heat or cool the environment as needed although increased heatwave frequency could intensify droughts increase the risk of wildfires alter the ecosystems and economy cause weather related deaths as a result of heat stress increased ozone levels and particulate matter reduce food and livestock productivity reduce the thermal efficiency of power production etc it is necessary to develop correct strategies to build resilience to heatwaves in the basin however the strategies would be optimal if the climate series used in deriving these extreme indices were free from errors 6 conclusion this study presented the homogenisation of three daily meteorological variables i e precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature data series over the lcb using acmant and climatol homogenisation methods these homogenisation methods are conceptually different though both are characterised as relative homogenisation methods acmant computes breakpoints based on the variable type and the study region s climate climatol on the other hand employs two separate parameterisation approaches i e the snht thresholds and normalisation to detect breaks the snht thresholds were set subjectively after exploring the different histograms of anomalies and the histograms of maximum snht outputs for different climatol iterations this makes homogenisation using climatol time consuming and computationally expensive both homogenisation techniques show the existence of unnatural breakpoints for most of the climate series however some series successfully passed the homogeneity test due to its sensitivity to short term biases acmant found more breaks than climatol in all situations although the frequency of breakpoint occurrences as observed by both homogenisation methods were similar there was no clear evidence of a better performance of one homogenisation method over the other however there is a general improvement in the quality of climate series by the two homogenisation methods as portrayed by the consistency of the results from the homogenised series contrariwise climatol performed better in the distance correlation properties although low correlation values could also be credited to poor station density the anomaly classification showed misrepresentations of these classifications by the raw series compared to the homogenised series however both homogenised series had similar classification this depicts a consistent homogenised data series comparing the homogenised outputs from homogenisation methods enables a more reliable evaluation of homogeneity results furthermore the trends in the extreme climate indices were either underestimated or overestimated by the raw series specifically the heatwave amplitude as defined by the excess heat factor was underestimated in the raw series however care must be taken when interpreting this because the length of the period under analysis could influence the trends of day count indices with defined thresholds in contrast the trends of percentile based indices are affected by both the length of the period of interest and the time series selected base period precisely percentile based indices are far more sensitive to the chosen base period than the day count indices in addition the amplitude of the trends may differ if different base periods were considered as this depends on whether percentiles were obtained from a relatively colder or warmer base era yosef et al 2021 in conclusion inhomogeneities in climate series could overestimate underestimate or reverse the climate and hydrological extremes trend thereby providing erroneous information such misinterpretations could hinder the development of optimal climate change adaptation mitigation strategies and relevant water resources management strategies thereby reducing the adaptive capability of the basin s inhabitants to climate change effects consequently the hydrological regimes could be misunderstood although this study is limited by the spatial station representation as well as the span of quality time series which is persistent in this region this research provides the first quality controlled and homogenised dataset that could be relevant for examining long term

3613,daily precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature series are homogenised over the lake chad basin between 1979 and 2020 using two conceptually different homogenisation methods the adapted caussinus mestre algorithm for homogenising networks of temperature series acmant and the iterated standard normal homogeneity climatol results show the existence of unnatural breakpoints for most of the station series however the two methods show a general improvement in the quality of climate series the trend estimation of the homogenised series based on the modified mann kendall methodology shows different modifications of the trend s magnitude for different periods overall climatol and acmant exhibit nearly similar trend patterns suggesting the credibility of both homogenisation methods relative to the base period of analysis 1981 2010 the anomaly classification for the entire basin between 1979 and 2020 into dry warm wet warm dry cold and wet cold are misrepresented by the raw series compared to the homogenised series such erroneous representations resulting from inhomogeneities in raw climate series could misinform decisions akin to climate change assessment and water resources management strategies thereby reducing the adaptive capability of the basin s inhabitants to climate change effects our study demonstrates the importance of robust homogenisation of climate series to mitigate inhomogeneity errors and improve the quality of information when observations are used in climate and hydrological studies keywords trend climatol acmant homogenisation climate

homogeneity test ita innovative trend analysis 1 introduction in the past years there has been an increase in the occurrence of climate extreme events these have been attributed to climate change ornes 2018 bellprat et al 2019 according to ipcc 2021 the rise in air temperature has exacerbated global warming issues for a reliable climate change and variability study it is vital to detect and correct inhomogeneities in the observed time series venema et al 2012 adeyeri et al 2019a aguilar et al 2003 this is also important when observations are used to estimate future climate scenarios laapas and venäläinen 2017 inhomogeneities in climate time series could incorporate biases and spurious trends leading to erroneous result interpretations mamara et al 2013 adeyeri et al 2017 della marta et al 2004 emphasised that the extent of these biases is of the same magnitude as the investigated climate change or variability indicators therefore climate time series must be homogenous i e the variations in the time series must be only from weather and climate variations peterson et al 1998 however various non climatic influences such as relocation of stations changes in observed practices instrumentation and recalibration changes have rendered most climate series unreliable for the actual climate variations peterson et al 1998 other factors include land use change different homogenisation methods have been developed and used to detect and correct inhomogeneities in climate series all over the world alexandersson 1986 ducré robitaille et al 2003 domonkos and coll 2017 fioravanti et al 2019 adeyeri et al 2019a guijarro 2018 domonkos 2011 pérez zanón et al 2015 mamara et al 2013 adeyeri et al 2020a some methods homogenise climate series in the individual station using the hierarchical structures alexandersson and moberg 1997 others correct inhomogeneity jointly on a series of participating stations using suitable mathematical methods lindau and venema 2016 domonkos and coll 2017 domonkos 2021 adeyeri et al 2019b joint homogenisation domonkos and coll 2017 is preferable to the hierarchic approach especially when several breaks are present in the climate series conversely methods that rely on non stationarity checks of single climatological series beaulieu et al 2009 are based on the impractical hypothesis of a stable climate guijarro 2018 also it is impossible to separate inhomogeneity from climate change signals using this approach szentimrey et al 2014 therefore relative homogenisation approaches whose stationarity checks are examined across the candidate series and one or more well correlated neighbour series are preferable guijarro 2018 mamara et al 2013 homogenised greece s mean monthly temperature time series using the multiple analysis of series for homogenization mash and climatol from 1960 to 2004 they reported that the homogenisation methods improved data series spatial and temporal consistencies for an improved climate variability study fioravanti et al 2019 homogenised daily maximum and minimum temperatures for italy between 1961 and 2017 using acmant and climatol they stated that both methods detected non climatic discontinuities in the data series the results agree with mamara et al 2013 emphasising an improved spatial coherence in the homogenised data series while the trends show more accurate and consistent climatic patterns finally azorin molina et al 2019 homogenised daily peak wind gusts for australia between 1941 and 2016 using climatol the results show that the method corrects inconsistent data while filling in all missing values of the essential climate variables precipitation and temperature mainly were used to develop and evaluate different methods in these studies although precipitation and temperature changes in a river basin influence river discharge limitations such as spatial and temporal coverage climate series inhomogeneities regional forcing and differences impose various uncertainties on hydrometeorological studies huntington 2006 adeyeri et al 2019a the lake chad basin lcb is characterised by rainfall and temperature variability the repeated drought episodes and more recently flooding events resulting from the partial rainfall recovery in the sahel have been of concern to policymakers and inhabitants of the basin adeyeri et al 2019a funk et al 2010 thompson and polet 2000 this variability is not limited to the lcb other river basins in the tropical and subtropical regions are faced with this condition moron et al 2008 ngarukiyimana et al 2018 laux et al 2020 although adeyeri et al 2019a corrected the inhomogeneities in some climate series in the komadugu yobe basin kyb which is a sub basin of the lcb from 1971 to 2013 using acmant version 3 1 the reliability of the homogenised climate series was not established domonkos and coll 2017 emphasised that this method is more reliable in places with high stations density and spatial correlation between individual climate stations in contrast the climate stations distribution in the sub basin is limited and the effect of station density was not assessed in adeyeri et al 2019a however investigating inhomogeneities using different homogenisation methods give more reliable and robust results begert et al 2005 štěpánek et al 2009 fioravanti et al 2019 given this this study homogenised three daily meteorological variables i e precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature data series over the lcb from 1979 to 2020 using two different approaches even though the two approaches are classified as relative homogenisation techniques the break detection methods are conceptually distinct acmant automatically determines breakpoints based on the climatic features of the study region variable type and temporal resolution on the other hand climatol detects breaks subjectively based on two different parameterisation schemes i e the snht thresholds and normalisation subsequently the homogenisation effects on the trend and some selected climate indices were considered due to the lack of stations metadata inhomogeneities in the data series may not ascertain the actual climate signal discontinuity hence the efficiency of the two homogenisation approaches is not considered but the results from the two approaches were compared to establish the reliability of the homogenised outputs however it is expected that the raw series s quality will improve after homogenisation therefore this study advanced on previous studies in the basin due to the availability of more stations the use of a new acmant algorithm and the application of an additional algorithm to verify the robustness of the homogenised results subsequently contributes to the overall understanding of inhomogeneities in climate series on the trend of meteorological variables and extreme climate events in the basin 2 geographical information and data 2 1 geographical information the lcb is a sedimentary groundwater basin encompassing eight african countries with an elevation between 154 and 3412 m the size is about 2 400 000 km2 fig 1 which approximates 8 of the entire african landmass fortnam and oguntola 2004 lake chad is situated in the southern part of the sahara desert in the lcb this lake is principally fed by the chari logone komadugu gana and the komadugu yobe river sub systems these river systems with the associated wetlands enhance diverse commercial activities e g fish production pastoralism trading and ecological activities e g forest regeneration recession agriculture ecosystem preservation currently the survival of over 38 million people hinges on these activities being carried out in the basin iucn 2011 giz 2015 the significant water loss in the basin is by evaporation and infiltration three climatic zones are found in this basin to the north is the saharan desert climate to the south is the sudan climate accompanied by a hot wet and dry season to the centre is the sahelian climate with wet and dry seasons giz 2015 the dominant wind system i e the south easterly monsoon wind gathers moisture from the atlantic ocean inland in the wet season heavy rains accompany this the dominant north easterly wind gathers dust from the sahara desert down to the south in the dry season this is accompanied by harmattan dust haze and dryness warner 2004 the basin is characterised by high rainfall variability and recurrent drought thompson and polet 2000 giz 2015 the recurrence and severity of drought often leave the communities in this basin susceptible thereby reducing their adaptive capacity to climate change adeyeri et al 2019b before the drought events this basin had contributed significant water volume to lake chad however these drought events have caused significant changes to the environmental structure and hydrology of the basin this subsequently affects agriculture livestock and fish production giz 2015 also regional climate change and unsuitable water management practices have altered the seasonal river flow thereby reducing water flow in the basin iucn 2011 adeyeri et al 2020b this has considerably reduced the water inflow into lake chad henceforward contributing to the reduction of lake chad over the last four decades iucn 2011 giz 2015 on the other hand the recent flood events have threatened the socio economic well being lives and properties of people living in the basin adeyeri et al 2020b therefore to efficiently understand the climate instability in the basin reliable climate variability and climate change studies must be carried out using accurate climate data series 2 2 data daily meteorological data series precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature archived by the direction de la meteorologie nationale dmn nigeria meteorological agency nimet and the trans african hydrometeorological observatory tahmo were used for the analysis although some of the stations from the above institutions have few data series incomplete data over the analysis period were obtained from other external databases to complete the climate series up to 2020 due to the various data formats and sources the various stations were examined based on the metadata provided to identify repeated stations in some cases the metadata is not available to ascertain the correctness of the station names and properties from the different data sources in this case duplicated stations were harmonised according to their elevation and distance fioravanti et al 2019 station pairs within the radius of 500 m altitude and 2 km apart were initially inspected based on the similarities in their names using the levenshtein distance metric fick and hijmans 2017 3 methods erroneous climate data could lead to false trends inhomogeneities reduced cross correlation between station pairs reduced homogenisation performance biased climate extremes statistics and a completely wrong interpretation in climate analysis it is therefore imperative to quality control climate data series heim 2015 adeyeri et al 2017 domonkos and coll 2017 hunziker et al 2017 fioravanti et al 2019 gbode et al 2019 therefore due to the various sources of the daily climate series they were subjected to two levels of quality control 1 in the first level temporal consistency days with maximum temperature lesser than minimum temperature outliers negative precipitation values and other basic integrity checks were inspected and corrected 2 the spatial consistency of each time series was assessed for the neighbouring stations much closer stations outside the basin were also considered for this hunziker et al 2018 after the preprocessing steps complete climate series were obtained from 1979 to 2020 for 45 stations table 1 3 1 homogenisation detecting non climatic breaks in climate series can be done using different statistical tests in this study two relative homogenisation approaches were considered in a relative homogenisation approach individual participating climate series are checked against one or many reference climate series representatives in the study region fioravanti et al 2019 mamara et al 2013 guijarro 2018 the relative homogeneity approaches used in this study are acmant and climatol several studies domonkos 2011 mamara et al 2013 lindau and venema 2013 domonkos and coll 2017 chimani et al 2018 azorin molina et al 2019 fioravanti et al 2019 adeyeri et al 2019b adeyeri et al 2019a have documented the effectiveness of these methods in homogenising climate series in acmant the inhomogeneity detection incorporates a weighted reference while data breaks numbers in climate series are optimised using the caussinus lyazrhi criterion caussinus and lyazrhi 1997 the optimal step function fitting minimises the internal distance variance while maximising the external distance variance venema et al 2012 domonkos and coll 2017 the shift in annual means is identified using bivariate detection technique as described below domonkos and coll 2017 1 m i n j 1 j 2 j k k 0 k i j k 1 j k 1 d v 1 k i 2 c d v k i 2 the internal distance d is specified as 2 d v i v q i v q k w h

series climatic mean to fill the missing values in the candidate series the full report on the acmant method is presented in domonkos and coll 2017 due to the location of the study area the irregular seasonality model from the acmant 4 3 version was used for homogenisation domonkos 2019 2021 conversely there were three stages involved when homogenising with climatol stage 1 applies the standard normal homogeneity test snht originally developed by alexandersson 1986 based on stepped overlapping temporal windows of the climate series consequently the climate series are split according to the breaks instead of applying snht on overlapping temporal windows stage 2 runs it through the entire time series stage 3 fills the missing data by calculating the weighted ratios of the homogenous series of the nearby stations the details are presented in guijarro 2018 using ward s agglomerative clustering method ward 1963 the raw climate series was divided into different homogenous groups clusters for a reliable homogeneity assessment fig s1 subsequently more prominent cluster pairs were derived from merging the cluster pairs with minimum distance lastly the cluster s dendrogram was used to determine the clustering partition based on the clusters ranked results furthermore two different parameterisation schemes i e the snht thresholds and normalisation were adopted for this study the rates to the mean normalisation approach were used for precipitation because it has natural zeroes with a skewed probability distribution in contrast standardised normalisation was used for the temperature variables although snht thresholds have been established for different lengths of series as well as at different levels of significance e g khaliq and ouarda 2007 it is however important to subjectively adopt or compare these values depending on the climate variable as well as the extent of the correlation between series and the temporal frequency guijarro 2018 bearing this in mind the snht thresholds were set subjectively after exploring the different histograms of anomalies and histograms of maximum snht outputs for different climatol iterations 40 iterations in total consequently the variables were homogenised on a daily scale due to the unavailability of metadata the credibility of the homogenised data series was assessed using the anomaly and trends estimation 3 2 trends and spatial interpolation the homogenised climate series was subjected to the modified mann kendall mmk trend test yue and wang 2004 adeyeri et al 2017 ahmed et al 2020a oyerinde et al 2021 and the innovative trend analysis ita şen 2017 wang et al 2020 şen 2012 the magnitude of the trend was established using sen s estimator sen 1968 ahmed et al 2020b adeyeri and ishola 2021 besides establishing monotonic trends and trend significance the change magnitude and length of change occurrence also have different consequences and effects on the management and planning of water resources to characterise the trend patterns the ita method was adopted the ita method splits data time series into two halves before sorting both halves in ascending order the first xi and the second half yi of the series are plotted on a cartesian coordinate system on the horizontal and vertical axes respectively a no trend line that splits the decreasing and the increasing trends is represented by the 1 1 line on the coordinate system there exists a monotonic decreasing increasing trend when the scatter points from the series fall below above the no trend line if there are different trends in the series the data series is categorised into two clusters namely high and low clusters şen 2012 the trend slope s in ita is calculated as 6 s 2 y 2 y 1 n where n is the number of data and y 1 and y 2 are the arithmetic averages of the second and the first halves of the dependent variable y sequence the centroid point for each cluster is the arithmetic average of the two halves that falls on the data line if the critical value scr is greater than s then the trend is not significant otherwise there is a significant trend since y 1 and y 2 are stochastic variables the first order moment e of s is calculated 7 e s 2 n e y 2 e y 1 if e y 2 e y 1 the centroid point falls on the 1 1 line indicating no trend otherwise the variance of the slope as a result of the difference between the moments is given as α s 2 e s 2 e 2 s 4 n 2 e y 2 2 2 e y 2 y 1 e y 1 2 this is the second order moment of the slope considering that e y 2 2 e y 1 2 8 α s 2 8 n 2 e y 2 2 e y 2 y 1 8 n 2 α 2 n 1 γ y 2 y 1 where γ y 2 y 1 is the coefficient of correlation between the two mean values which is given as γ y 2 y 1 e y 2 y 1 e y 2 e y 1 α y 1 α y 2 subsequently the confidence limit cl of the trend slope of a standard normal probability distribution function with zero mean and standard deviation scr is given as cl 1 β 0 scr αs where αs is the slope s standard deviation β is the significance level thus the cl line is situated above and below the no trend line details of this method are presented in şen 2017 2012 the cluster analysis for the trend follows lloyd s algorithm celebi 2015 lloyd 1982 everitt et al 2001 subsequently to investigate the trends over multiple periods the trend over moving periods of various lengths rasmus et al 2015 is analysed for the study period in this approach the y and x axes denote the length of each period and the respective starting points in addition statistically significant trends were marked with black boxes the advantage of this method lies in its ability to illustrate trends over several time scales taking into account every peculiarity in trend from the starting to the ending period therefore the moving period trend analysis is more detailed than the single period trend estimation additionally the effects of homogeneity on the trends in climate extreme indices and anomalies were examined furthermore the areal mean basin s precipitation and temperature variables are estimated using the thiessen polygon approach thissen 1911 yamada 2017 and station averaging respectively subsequently the anomaly classification of the areal mean variables was assessed royé 2020 ruane and mcdermid 2017 laux et al 2021 4 results in this section the results for the homogenisation processes are presented the comparison between climatol and acmant outputs were evaluated using different statistics based on the consistency of the results using the two homogenisation approaches the improvements of the homogenous outputs over the raw originally observed climate series was shown finally the effect of inhomogeneities on the trends of extreme events was examined 4 1 breakpoint detection the first step is to identify breaks in the climate series fig 2 shows the number of breaks for each station and each variable some series successfully passed the homogeneity test for the total number of breaks the maximum temperature series record 59 and 69 breaks for climatol and acmant respectively while minimum temperature has 71 and 78 breaks for climatol and acmant respectively the precipitation series has 23 and 26 breaks for climatol and acmant respectively due to the lack of station metadata the causes of the breakpoints could not be accurately ascertained however the breakpoints especially in goure and jos could be attributed to the change in station location and instrument recalibration respectively the breakpoints in katsina are induced by a shift in the exposure of the measurement devices because of landcover changes 4 2 statistical summary the seasonal statistical summary of the basin s series fig 3 shows the different series distribution especially in the seasonal series for all variables each density curve s breadth correlates to each area s estimated frequency of data points the peaks troughs and tails of each density curve are compared to determine any similarities or discrepancies in the series a broad density curve indicates a high frequency of values in that range in contrast a narrow density curve shows a low occurrence of values in that range generally the properties mentioned earlier are different for each variable at different timescales for example the annual maximum temperature shows different magnitudes of underestimation especially in the different quantiles compared to the acmant and climatol series also the density curve for the raw series differs considerably from the homogenised series subsequently the changes in the mean between the raw and the homogenised series are calculated at a 95 confidence level results show significant changes in mean for all variables except for the mean difference between the raw and homogenised series of annual maximum temperature as well as the annual minimum temperature series between climatol and the raw series which are not statistically significant fig s2 shows the comparison between the correlation coefficient and stations distance for daily maximum air temperature and precipitation considering ten sampled series there is an overall improvement in the correlation distance map for the homogenised series however the climatol homogenised series perform better in both cases moreover a lower correlation is possible when the distance between the stations is more as in this study furthermore the temporal distribution of the mean annual anomaly for the entire basin between 1979 and 2020 is presented in fig 4 while there are some similarities in the distribution of anomaly for all series it is noteworthy that some years are classified differently in the raw series compared to the homogenised series for example the year 1999 is classified as a wet cold year with anomalies 0 4 c mean temperature and 30 relative precipitation anomaly in the raw series while this is the same for the homogenised series except for the mean temperature anomalies which are 0 6 c in both cases furthermore 1986 is classified as dry warm in the raw series with 0 5 c mean temperature anomaly and 9 relative precipitation anomaly however this is different for both acmant and climatol homogenised series dry cold 0 5 c and 5 5 dry cold 0 2 c and 6 respectively also the year 1990 is classified as dry warm but with different anomaly magnitudes for the raw series the temperature anomaly is 0 6 c as against 0 7 c for both acmant and climatol series the year 2006 is classified as a dry and cold year for the raw series however it is classified as a dry and warm year for the homogenised series other years which are misclassified by the raw series are 1995 and 2000 4 3 trends 4 3 1 variables and associated extremes to assess the effect of homogenisation on variable trends the mmk multiple period trend and ita methodology are adopted and the results are presented in this section based on the mmk methodology figs 5 and 6 present the trends in some climate extreme indices on the station scale between 1979 and 2020 there are different modifications to the trend s magnitude and direction for the different series for example in fig 5i there is a significant decreasing trend 95 confidence level in the raw average daily wet day rainfall intensity in ngaoundere cameroon see fig 1 for station location however there is a significant increasing trend of more than 0 5 mm days decade for the homogenised series the overall magnitude range of the negative trend in the raw series is between 0 1 and 1 5 mm days decade compared to the homogenised series 0 1 to 1 8 mm days decade nevertheless the behaviour of the specific station based magnitude is mixed for example the trend in goure niger has an increasing trend 0 5 mm days decade in the raw series however the homogenised series has a decreasing trend of 0 1 mm days decade for the tropical nights fig 5 ii most series have significant increasing trends but the raw series overall magnitude ranges from 3 to 34 days decade doubling the homogenised series 2 17 days decade for the trend in the days that contribute to cold and heatwave fig 6 most stations in the raw series show a decreasing trend in the days that contribute to cold wave fig 6i yet the homogenised series have more stations with increasing trends the magnitude of the trend for the raw series varies from 8 to 3 days decade while that of the homogenised series varies from 3 to 13 days decade moreover not all series agree with the significant trends all series exhibit increasing trends for the days that contribute to heatwave frequency fig 6 ii although with an underestimation in the raw series additionally it should be noted that the days that contribute to both cold and heatwave is defined by the excess cold factor ecf and excess heat factor ehf respectively nairn and fawcett 2013 when a coldwave is in effect the ecf is negative ecf is high when a three day period is much colder than the previous 30 days i e a three day average daily temperature below the fifth percentile positive ecf levels indicate that a coldwave is not in process results from the multiple period trends for the basin average fig 7 show differences in the magnitude and trend significance for the moving periods for example there is a slight overestimation of the increasing annual precipitation trend between 1981 and 2011 in the raw series 0 20 mm decade compared to the homogenised series 0 10 mm decade the raw series also shows some statistically significant decreasing trends not observed in the homogenised series particularly in the raw series when observing from 1985 from the origin in the y direction there is a significant 99 confidence level decreasing trend for the next six years after 1985 which is not captured in the homogenised series nonetheless the overall trend properties are replicated in the homogenised series with different magnitudes and significance there is a general increase in the maximum and minimum temperature trends but with different significance and magnitudes for all series for example the homogenised maximum temperature series detect more significant increasing trends than the raw series therefore the raw series underestimate the trends in general the significant trends in both homogenised series are similar for minimum temperature the raw series detects more significant increasing trends although the trend magnitudes are overestimated in the raw series such misrepresentation in the raw series could lead to unreliable climate analysis thereby aggravating errors in hydrological studies fig 8 presents the results of the ita for the basin average it is noteworthy that the temperature increased for both raw and homogenised series however magnitudes vary the significant 99 confidence level trend is situated in the purple lines for the maximum temperature the magnitude of the increasing trend in the low temperature cluster is 0 3 0 5 and 0 6 c decade for the raw climatol and acmant series respectively however none of the trends is significant likewise the magnitude of the increasing trend of the entire temperature cluster is 0 2 0 3 and 0 3 c decade for the raw climatol and acmant series respectively in this case the raw series is statistically significant furthermore the low temperature duration in all series is identical for the raw and acmant series additionally a high cluster of temperature series means high temperature the trend in the high temperature cluster for the homogenised series is 0 3 c decade and 0 2 c decade for the raw series here all trends are significant the magnitude of the increasing trend in the low temperature cluster is overestimated by the raw series 0 7 c decade for the minimum temperature however none of the series exhibits significant trends for this cluster the increasing trend continues for the high temperature cluster with the raw and acmant series having the magnitude of 0 4 c decade while the climatol series has 0 3 c decade it is worth noting that the trend in the cluster of low temperature is higher than that of the high temperature cluster for all series there are non significant trends of 0 2 c decade for the entire minimum temperature cluster for the raw and homogenised series this contradicts adeyeri et al 2019a who stated that minimum temperature increases in the sub basin at the rate of 0 05 c year moreover this is incomparable because they considered climate series for different periods 1971 2013 and spatial extent additionally both raw and acmant series have more duration of low temperature while the raw series has the most high temperature period besides the trends the time series of some selected indices were also examined to understand the similarity in the series s annual climatology fig 9 shows a good level of similarity between the acmant and climatol time series for all the indices for example the raw series underestimated the growing degree days by up to 10 0days in 2010 while in 2012 it is up to 6 0days in addition there are some similarities between the raw and homogenised series in general the raw series underestimates indices magnitude nevertheless the zoom plots show apparent differences and similarities in the magnitudes specifically between 2005 and 2020 4 3 2 effect of homogenisation on climate extremes to examine the effect of homogenisation on the trend of climate extremes a joint sector specific climate indices et sci and the expert teams on climate change detection and indices etccdi were considered table 2 klein tank et al 2009 perkins and alexander 2013 zhang et al 2011 alexander and herold 2015 alexander et al 2018 nairn and fawcett 2013 these trends were calculated based on the mmk approach at a 95 confidence level the result shows various underestimations and overestimations observed by the raw and homogenised series table 3 even though both acmant and climatol have similar trends in most indices fourteen indices are statistically significant for climatol while thirteen are statistically significant for acmant and the raw series since each series was uniquely generated based on different homogeneity algorithms and this particular analysis is done on the areal scale the various positive and negative compensations resulting from station averaging may likely cause the differences in the number of significant indices in both homogenised series specifically the daily temperature range dtr trends are 0 15 0 03 and 0 05 c decade for raw climatol and acmant respectively although all trends are significant it is worth noting that the raw series underestimated the dtr trend negative positive dtr trends indicate an increase decrease in both maximum and minimum temperature with the minimum temperature having an increased reduced warming rate therefore the raw series shows an overestimation of the warming rate additionally the fraction of total wet day rainfall that comes from very wet days r95ptot is underestimated by the raw series 2 35 while climatol and acmant recorded 2 82 and 2 8 respectively the trend in the growing degree days is slightly underestimated by the raw series 62 94 days decade as against 65 31 days decade for climatol and 65 06 days decade for acmant all series have positive heatwave amplitude as defined by the excess heat factor the heatwave with the highest heatwave magnitude however the raw series underestimates it furthermore there is a positive trend in the number of days contributing to heatwaves defined by the 90th percentile of minimum temperature yet the raw series overestimated it nevertheless the positive or negative trends are most significant with different magnitudes for the different series also both homogenised series have similar trend magnitudes 5 discussion for a reliable climate variability and climate change assessment the quality control and subsequent homogenisation of climate data series must be executed venema et al 2012 this improves the quality of the observed dataset and subsequently improves future climate scenarios estimations made from such observed series laapas and venäläinen 2017 in this study daily precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature data series were homogenised over the lcb using acmant domonkos and coll 2017 domonkos 2021 and climatol guijarro 2018 homogenisation methods the breakpoints frequency anomaly classification and the effect of homogenisation on the trend and some selected climate indices were considered most stations considered in the study have breakpoints at different times however in all cases acmant detected more breaks than climatol in concert pérez zanón et al 2015 stated that more breaks are detected in acmant due to its sensitivity to short term biases furthermore the frequency of breakpoint occurrences as observed by both homogenisation methods was similar the average number of breaks was between 1 and 2 for the precipitation and temperature series respectively with 20 stations having one breakpoint in the precipitation series as observed by acmant this agrees with lindau and venema 2018 and fioravanti et al 2019 who stated separately that the frequency of inhomogeneities is about one in every 15 to 20 years however due to the lack of complete metadata the cause of these breaks could not be ascertained in its entirety nevertheless investigating inhomogeneities using different homogenisation methods give more reliable and robust results begert et al 2005 štěpánek et al 2009 fioravanti et al 2019 breaks in climate series could be caused by urbanisation paeth et al 2009 reduction increment in forest cover and anthropogenic activities birch 2014 changes in observed practices instrumentation and recalibration changes peterson et al 1998 additionally there was an overall improvement in the spatial consistency of the homogenised data series using the correlation distance approach a lower correlation could be ascribed to the considerable distance between the stations in the study area additionally a high correlation coefficient depicts a consistent homogenised data series and portrays an adequate missing data infilling process other causes of low correlation include differences in geographical properties e g topography which modulates precipitation regimes guijarro 2018 also based on the anomaly classification for the entire basin between 1979 and 2020 into dry warm wet warm dry cold and wet cold there were some misrepresentations of these classifications by the raw series compared to the homogenised series these misrepresentations could affect the proper management of water resources in the basin for example it could influence the regulations on water use lake ecology and hydrology flooding and future lake management options furthermore there were differences in the magnitude and direction of trends especially for the station based climate indices in general the results from the two homogenisation approaches were consistent there was a visible increment in the annual precipitation trend at some periods after drought episodes for the entire study period this may be attributed to the partial rainfall recovery in the sahel in general funk et al 2010 and the basin in particular adeyeri et al 2019a there were more positive trends for the temperature series for both raw and homogenised series this may be ascribed to the increasing temperature of the mediterranean and the north atlantic ocean funk et al 2010 and global climate change ipcc 2021 to efficiently and effectively manage water resources it is crucial to know the nature of trends occurrences after identifying them hence trend characterisation and categorisation are essential for the categorisation of trends there were differences in the magnitude and significance of the increasing trend in the temperature cluster for all series most importantly the magnitude of the significantly increasing trend of the high temperature cluster was similar for both homogenised series while it was different for the raw series however the magnitude of the significantly increasing trend of the entire temperature cluster agrees with a previous study in the kyb by adeyeri et al 2019a who stated that the maximum temperature increases in the basin at the rate of 0 03 c year from 1971 to 2013 while using acmant notably the results advanced on adeyeri et al 2019a due to the availability of more stations the use of a new acmant algorithm and an additional method to verify the robustness of the homogenised results in addition the improved data quality resulting from homogenisation using a different acmant algorithm and the climatol homogenisation approaches were also compared also as the trend of high temperature increases the hydrological cycle is intensified leading to wetter rain seasons or dryer dry seasons subsequently frequent floods or drought furthermore increased temperature increases the severity of heavy precipitation by increasing atmospheric moisture which drives the precipitation event through moisture convergence at low altitudes trenberth and shea 2005 berg et al 2009 it was established that the temperature in the basin is increasing this could result in more hydrometeorological extreme conditions in floods and drought occurrences mall et al 2006 indeed there have been flooding incidents in the kyb due to the significant precipitation intensity and subsequent runoff adeyeri et al 2019a this could severely affect the quantity and quality of available and accessible water besides crop yields may decline adeyeri et al 2019a and specific ecosystems may go extinct schindler 1997 melaku melese 2016 swenson and baldwin 1965 likewise the precipitation regime is altered affecting the timing and magnitude of river discharge additionally high temperature influences water chemistry and electrical conductivity biases arising from inhomogeneities could provide misguided information in developing desirable climate adaptation and mitigation strategies that will affect good energy planning and management i e effective ways to heat or cool the environment as needed although increased heatwave frequency could intensify droughts increase the risk of wildfires alter the ecosystems and economy cause weather related deaths as a result of heat stress increased ozone levels and particulate matter reduce food and livestock productivity reduce the thermal efficiency of power production etc it is necessary to develop correct strategies to build resilience to heatwaves in the basin however the strategies would be optimal if the climate series used in deriving these extreme indices were free from errors 6 conclusion this study presented the homogenisation of three daily meteorological variables i e precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature data series over the lcb using acmant and climatol homogenisation methods these homogenisation methods are conceptually different though both are characterised as relative homogenisation methods acmant computes breakpoints based on the variable type and the study region s climate climatol on the other hand employs two separate parameterisation approaches i e the snht thresholds and normalisation to detect breaks the snht thresholds were set subjectively after exploring the different histograms of anomalies and the histograms of maximum snht outputs for different climatol iterations this makes homogenisation using climatol time consuming and computationally expensive both homogenisation techniques show the existence of unnatural breakpoints for most of the climate series however some series successfully passed the homogeneity test due to its sensitivity to short term biases acmant found more breaks than climatol in all situations although the frequency of breakpoint occurrences as observed by both homogenisation methods were similar there was no clear evidence of a better performance of one homogenisation method over the other however there is a general improvement in the quality of climate series by the two homogenisation methods as portrayed by the consistency of the results from the homogenised series contrariwise climatol performed better in the distance correlation properties although low correlation values could also be credited to poor station density the anomaly classification showed misrepresentations of these classifications by the raw series compared to the homogenised series however both homogenised series had similar classification this depicts a consistent homogenised data series comparing the homogenised outputs from homogenisation methods enables a more reliable evaluation of homogeneity results furthermore the trends in the extreme climate indices were either underestimated or overestimated by the raw series specifically the heatwave amplitude as defined by the excess heat factor was underestimated in the raw series however care must be taken when interpreting this because the length of the period under analysis could influence the trends of day count indices with defined thresholds in contrast the trends of percentile based indices are affected by both the length of the period of interest and the time series selected base period precisely percentile based indices are far more sensitive to the chosen base period than the day count indices in addition the amplitude of the trends may differ if different base periods were considered as this depends on whether percentiles were obtained from a relatively colder or warmer base era yosef et al 2021 in conclusion inhomogeneities in climate series could overestimate underestimate or reverse the climate and hydrological extremes trend thereby providing erroneous information such misinterpretations could hinder the development of optimal climate change adaptation mitigation strategies and relevant water resources management strategies thereby reducing the adaptive capability of the basin s inhabitants to climate change effects consequently the hydrological regimes could be misunderstood although this study is limited by the spatial station representation as well as the span of quality time series which is persistent in this region this research provides the first quality controlled and homogenised dataset that could be relevant for examining long term variability and trends of climate extreme as well as its related weather hazards in the dynamic lcb credit authorship contribution statement o e adeyeri conceptualization software methodology

3614,a marginal gas injection method was previously proposed based on two dimensional 2 d homogeneous porous media and the feasibility of isolating the oil shale pyrolysis zone from the surrounding hydrological environment had been demonstrated the gas water flow characteristics and dynamics during gas injection in 2 d porous media with a high permeability zone hpz were studied further based on the presence of a hpz after fracturing oil shale reservoirs a series of experiments were performed when the gas injection point was located outside at the boundary or inside the hpz case1 3 the hpz enriched the injected gas and in cases 2 and 3 the gas inside the hpz permeated to the low permeability zone lpz on both sides forming two wing tributaries however in case 1 water flowed into the hpz in the opposite direction in cases 2 and 3 the direction of the local pressure gradient on both sides of the hpz was completely opposite indicating that the distribution of the pressure field was the direct cause of the gas water flow characteristics therefore the water stopping effect of gas injection is primarily reflected in the hpz additionally the effect was best when the gas injection point was set at the boundary or inside of the hpz these results were verified using reservoir scale simulations and tests in which the water yield decreased to 100 kg d subsequently we recommended the sites of gas injection wells for water stopping all results are expected to provide strategies and theories for dealing with the adverse hydrological environment in large scale oil shale in situ exploitation keywords oil shale gas water flow high permeability zone desaturated zone water stopping 1 introduction oil shale is an abundant unconventional energy resource underground in situ pyrolysis is a technology that ensures clean and efficient exploitation of oil shale with efficient underground oil shale heating at its core brandt 2008 kang et al 2020 sun et al 2015 however the inflow of external groundwater into the high temperature pyrolysis zone reduces heating efficiency sun et al 2019 youhong et al 2021 limiting the development of oil shale in situ pyrolysis technology therefore effectively isolating the in situ pyrolysis zone from the surrounding hydrological environment is a difficult problem that must be solved currently the conventional water stopping methods for specific underground spaces are mainly achieved using grout curtains zhang et al 2014 zhenfang et al 2011 and artificial ground freezing walls agfs alzoubi et al 2020 the grout curtain is used to block pores and fractures by injecting cement slurry underground however owing to the high viscosity of the slurry the diffusion radius of the slurry around a single well is only 1 m with irreversible damage to the original formation structure guo et al 2020 hashimoto et al 2016 the agf method employs low temperature fluids to freeze the formation matrix and pore water using transient heat conduction with phase change followed by seepage channel blockage owing to the heat loss and low heat transfer efficiency the frozen radius is also only 0 5 1 m massarotti et al 2021 zhao et al 2015 therefore the aforementioned two methods have the disadvantages of a small water stopping range and high cost restricting their application in large scale oil shale in situ exploitation underground gas injection is a preferable method to control the unexpected flow of groundwater hence dror et al 2004 and sun and semprich 2013 studied the inhibition of gas injection on saline infiltration into coastal areas xie et al 2018 were the first to employ gas injection in restraining the infiltration of upstream groundwater where the results indicated that this method has the potential to prevent landslides owing to the advantages of underground gas injection we have proposed a marginal gas injection method in previous works to isolat the in situ pyrolysis zone from the surrounding hydrological environment liu et al 2020b sun et al 2019 this method forms a desaturated zone through high pressure gas injection at the edge of the pyrolysis zone and balances the peripheral pore water pressure and capillary pressure with the gas pressure in the desaturated zone to prevent the inflow of surrounding groundwater in the pilot project of oil shale in situ pyrolysis exploitation in the nong an and fuyu areas of china an effective water stopping radius of 20 m was achieved because of the high fluidity of the gas phase previous studies also revealed the characteristics of gas water two phase flow in 2 d homogeneous porous media liu et al 2021a b however after hydraulic fracturing is completed and a proppant support is established proppant filled fractures form along the direction of bedding simplified and regarded as 2 d porous media the high permeability zone hpz will form and the entire reservoir will exhibit macroheterogeneity therefore the investigation of gas water flow characteristics in 2 d porous media with hpz is critical for the use of marginal gas injection for water stopping gas water flow in heterogeneous media is generally used in petroleum engineering zhang et al 2020 carbon dioxide geological storage kazemifar et al 2016 oh et al 2017 air sparging for environmental treatment samani and geistlinger 2019 song et al 2015 yao et al 2020 and other fields the focuses are for recovery fingering phenomena and phase distribution with most of these works based on heterogeneous pores at the micron or nanoscale for example liu et al 2016 focused on the immiscible displacement morphology in heterogeneous pores scholars have studied gas breakthroughs in porous media with heterogeneous wettability and revealed the relationship between the residue of the displaced phase and heterogeneity geistlinger and ataei dadavi 2015 wolf et al 2020 mahmoodi et al 2020 and rezaei et al 2018 investigated the multiphase flow near wellbores with a low permeability skin layer where greater recovery was achieved by increasing the capillary pressure at the outlet in addition previous studies have increasingly focused on the retention of water after hydraulic fracturing and its influence on gas production shen et al 2016 wang and leung 2015 however few studies have focused on the macroheterogeneity caused by hydraulic fracturing particularly the effects of gas injection on water flow characteristics under this condition the macroheterogeneity of fractured oil shale reservoir is fully considered in this study as part of a continuing study of the gas injection barrier we proposed and explored based on 2 d homogeneous porous media gas injection experiments for water stopping were performed using 2 d porous media with hpz and the gas water flow dynamics were analyzed along with an equal scale numerical simulation finally the pilot project of oil shale in situ exploitation in the fuyu area of china was used as an example to conduct reservoir scale numerical simulation for verification this study could provide strategies and theories for dealing with the adverse hydrological environment in large scale oil shale in situ exploitation 2 experimental method and conceptual model 2 1 experimental method the positional relationship between the gas injection point and the hpz caused by hydraulic fracturing will influence the gas water flow characteristics this work focused on the effects of positional relationships on the water stopping effect as well as the effects of the permeability difference between the hpz and the surrounding low permeability zone lpz four schemes of 2 d porous media with hpz were designed for the aforementioned purposes as shown in fig 1 the three positional relationships between the gas injection point and hpz are presented in cases 1 3 the transverse width ratio of the hpz to the entire porous medium is 3 5 and the depth ratios are 1 4 2 4 and 3 4 table 1 presents the physical properties of the glass beads used to construct the porous media a mixture of medium and fine sand was used and the permeability ratio of hpz and lpz is 2 7 corresponding to cases 1 3 case 4 is used to investigate the effects of the difference in permeability in comparison to case 2 the permeability ratio in case 4 is increased to 5 1 indicating a mixture of coarse and fine sand a visual experimental system was adopted in this study and its core is a 2 d porous medium 45 cm 45 cm the thickness under the four schemes is approximately 1 3 1 5 mm five subregions can be created along the vertical flow direction based on the evenly distributed five outlets water flow rates qw of 8 4 15 6 and 22 8 ml min and gas injection flow rates qg of 50 200 500 and 2000 ml min were used to investigate the gas water flow characteristics after the initial water flow in the porous medium was stable gas injection flow rate qg was steadily increased when the steady state was reached after approximately 3 min based on the measured water discharge qwi of each outlet and difference in pressure the relative permeability of water krw of each subregion with i corresponding to the outlets could be calculated using darcy s law therefore the water stopping effect was evaluated using the krw as the index and the two phase distribution was captured using a camera 2 2 conceptual model 2 2 1 equal scale conceptual model in this study tough2 eos3 was utilized to simulate the gas water flow in the porous media talman et al 2004 a previous study validated the module s applicability to the cases implemented in this study sun et al 2019 tough2 provides different models for estimating the relative permeability and capillary pressure the van genuchten mualem model was employed in this study and the relative permeability of the liquid and gaseous phases can be expressed as follows genuchten 1980 1 k rl s 1 1 s 1 λ λ 2 i f s l s ls 1 i f s l s ls 2 k rg 1 s 2 1 s 2 i f s gr 0 1 k rl i f s gr 0 similarly the capillary pressure model can be expressed as follows 3 p cap p 0 s 1 λ 1 1 λ 4 s s l s lr 1 s lr s gr s s l s lr s ls s lr where sl denotes aqueous phase saturation sls and slr denote maximum aqueous phase saturation and aqueous phase residual saturation respectively sgr denotes gas phase residual saturation p0 denotes the capillary entry pressure and λ as well as m represent the fitting parameters the numerical simulation s parameters such as permeability porosity and flow rates are consistent with the experiments because the size of the 2 d experimental model is 45 cm 45 cm 0 14 cm the numerical simulation employs 2 d porous media of the same size a total of 2500 grid elements were divided and a single layer grid was considered along the longitudinal direction therefore the buoyancy of gas was not considered in the experimental process 2 2 2 reservoir scale conceptual model a reservoir scale conceptual model was developed using the pilot project of oil shale in situ exploitation in the fuyu area of china as an example the depth of the oil shale layer is 477 486 m gas injection for water stopping and pyrolysis tests were performed after hydraulic fracturing as shown in fig 2 the hydraulic fracturing area 70 m 20 m is centered on the production well fk1 and gas injection well fk2 the distance between the wells is 15 m zhao et al 2019 during the tests the fk2 well maintained a gas injection pressure of 13 mpa first a high pressure gas injection was used to create an interwell desaturated zone that can act as a water stopping zone and a downhole heat injection under same pressure conditions was used in the same well for the pyrolysis of oil shale therefore in the later stage the high pressure desaturated zone transforms into the high temperature pyrolysis zone a gas circulation pressure of 1 mpa was used to maintain recovery in the fk1 well to achieve real time drainage a 2 d conceptual model was developed based on the geological engineering conditions as shown in fig 3 the model s transverse distance is 100 m its width is 50 m and the hydraulic fracturing area is in the center with fk1 and fk2 wells spaced at 15 m intervals based on the results obtained via the hydrological test the permeability of the interwell reservoir after hydraulic fracturing is approximately 1 md considering that the original rock permeability is one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of the permeability after fracturing the permeability of the original rock area is set at 0 1 md 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of gas water flow the presence of a hydraulic fracturing area will affect the characteristics of gas water flow which will be primarily reflected in two aspects 1 the influence of the positional relationship and 2 the influence of the permeability ratio therefore the targeted investigation is beneficial in optimizing the technical parameters for the anticipated water stopping effect 3 1 1 influence of the positional relationship the positional relationship determines the gas flow path in porous media i e from the lpz to the hpz or vice versa fig 4 shows the distribution of gas and water at different positional relationships and gas flow rates the white area represents the desaturated zone the dark area represents the saturation zone red points represent gas injection points and the white spots on both sides represent reserved holes that have been blocked by glass glue regardless of the positional relationship increasing the gas flow rate increases gas saturation in the desaturated zone the injected gas primarily flows in the hpz implying that the hpz has an enrichment effect on gas flow reddy and adams 2001 with the enrichment effect being more prominent when the gas injection point is located within the hpz in case 1 fig 4a1 d1 shows that as the gas flow rate increases from 50 to 2000 ml min the boundary of the hpz exhibits a prominent high water saturation band this is because when the gas and water flow from the lpz to the hpz the diameter of the pore throat suddenly increases subjecting the water to a large capillary pressure then part of the pore water is bound at the interface as shown in the black box in fig 4c1 almost no gas permeates from the hpz to the lpz on either side which will be explained in detail in the following dynamic analysis because the injected gas initially diffuses outward from the lpz a large amount of gas flows out along the hpz which is a low resistance fluid channel although the desaturated zone covers the entire downstream area owing to the arbitrariness of gas fingering in the initial stage the gas flow velocity outside the hpz will be considerably lower than that inside because approximately 95 of the gas flow is concentrated in the hpz fig 5 in case 2 the pore structure on both sides of the gas injection point exhibit remarkable differences therefore upon gas injection the initial selection of the gas flow path will determine the distribution of gas and water as shown in fig 4a2 d2 the injected gas mostly flows inside the hpz the enrichment effect is more pronounced in this case than that in case 1 when the gas flow rate exceeds 500 ml min the gas flow begins to break through to the lpz as shown in fig 4c2 1 tree shaped gas fingers with the gas injection point as the source are formed upstream and 2 the gas flow inside the hpz permeates to the lpz on both sides forming two wing tributaries as shown by the red boxes and arrows in fig 4 in case 3 the gas water flow characteristics are essentially consistent with the previous two cases and all of the injected gas is essentially enriched in the hpz when the gas flow rate is 2000 ml min part of the gas permeates from both sides of the hpz to the external lpz forming two wing tributaries but no gas permeates upstream the positional relationship influences the gas water flow which in turn influences the water stopping effect of gas injection therefore the change in krw in each subregion was evaluated owing to the limitation of the model size the presence of hpz will affect the initial permeability therefore based on case 2 calculating krw after gas injection eliminates the influence of macroheterogeneity and the results for each subregion are obtained when the gas flow rate is 2000 ml min as shown in fig 5 in any case the enriched gas flow in the hpz is exceeding 90 the high gas saturation in the hpz reduces internal krw considerably whereas it has little effect in the lpz the greater the dynamic water effect the greater the krw in case 1 krw in the hpz is 0 4 whereas in cases 2 and 3 it is 0 1 because of the presence of hpz the distribution of krw in 2 d porous media has a u shape which differs from the v shape distribution observed in a previous study of homogeneous media liu et al 2021b this disparity indicates that in reservoirs with hydraulic fracturing the water stopping effect of gas injection is primarily reflected in the hydraulic fracturing area with the marginal area exhibiting only a limited effect unless the gas flow rate is high 3 1 2 influence of the permeability ratio the hydraulic fracturing area will have different permeabilities owing to hydraulic fracturing technology and degree therefore the permeability of the hpz and original rock area will have different ratios the influence of permeability ratios on two phase flow characteristics and the water stopping effect is investigated further in this study permeability ratios of 2 7 and 5 1 are chosen for qualitative discussion in this experiment fig 6 shows the evolution of gas water flow under a permeability ratio of 5 1 when the gas flow rate is less than 200 ml min gas primarily flows in the hpz and gas fingering is sparser indicating that the gas flow develops as capillary fingering when the gas flow rate exceeds 200 ml min the density of the gas flow increases and viscous fingering develops furthermore until the gas flow rate reaches its maximum only a small amount of gas passes through from the hpz to the marginal lpz and less gas flows upstream when compared to the gas flow distribution in fig 4a2 d2 the results show that increasing the permeability ratio makes it more difficult for gas to flow to the lpz the distribution of krw is depicted in fig 7 the results show that when the water flow rate is 8 4 ml min krw in the hpz is approximately 0 2 and the value gradually increases to approximately 0 4 as the water flow rate increases according to the aforementioned analysis when the permeability ratio is 2 7 even if the water flow rate reaches 22 8 ml min krw can still be maintained at around 0 18 indicating that increasing the permeability ratio increases krw by 50 halving the water stopping effect this difference is caused by the gas water distribution although almost all the injected gas flows through the hpz the gas saturation in the desaturated zone decreases because of the rapid outflow of gas from the outlets and the inhibition of water flow is weakened accordingly 3 1 3 fluid dynamic analysis to further investigate and verify the characteristics of gas water flow in porous media with hpz we performed numerical simulations under the same parameters and conducted a dynamic analysis of gas water flow along with the aforementioned experimental results because pressure gradients control gas water flow in porous media the distribution characteristics of the pressure field and gas saturation determine the gas water flow characteristics as shown in fig 8 the shape of the desaturated zone in cases 1 and 2 is semielliptical which is consistent with fig 4d1 and d2 the gas saturation in the upstream lpz is relatively low which is consistent with the characteristics of the local desaturated zone formed by tree shaped gas fingers in fig 4d2 therefore the simulation results are highly accurate and sufficiently reflect the distribution of the pressure field and water flow velocity in the aforementioned experiments which can reproduce data that are difficult to monitor in the experiments the maximum pressure decreases from 28 kpa to 21 kpa because the area of the hpz increases additionally the positional relationship determines the position of the pressure core in the media in case 1 the pressure core is located outside the hpz and gas flows downstream in a gaussian distribution under the influence of high pressure liu et al 2021b song et al 2015 the enrichment effect occurs when the gas flows through the hpz and only 10 of the gas flows along the lpz on both sides the average pressure in the hpz is 8 kpa which is relatively lower than that in the lpz on both sides and considerably lower than the upstream pressure core of 28 kpa as a result of the pressure gradient the water in the lpz will flow to the hpz by contrast the gas inside the hpz hardly permeates through the lpz against the pressure gradient because of which there is no gas flow outward from the hpz in fig 4c1 d1 in this case the water flow in the lpz on both sides continuously infiltrates into the hpz causing krw to remain constant at 0 4 the blue arrows in fig 8 depict the direction of local water flow in cases 2 and 3 the pressure core gradually transfers from the lpz to the inside of the hpz in this case the gas flows downstream along the hpz after leaving the gas injection point considerably enhancing the enrichment effect furthermore in cases 2 and 3 the average pressure levels in the hpz are 10 kpa and 12 kpa respectively in comparison to case 1 the pressure level increases and the pressure gradient at the permeability transition interface reverses therefore the phenomenon of water flowing to the hpz from both sides vanishes however gas in the hpz permeates both sides because of the pressure gradient which explains the existence of gas tributaries on both sides of the hpz in fig 4d2 and d3 the characteristics of this pressure field can considerably inhibit the invasion of external water into the hpz as shown by the blue arrows the external water flows almost parallel to the boundary of the hpz reducing krw to 0 1 because the initial water flow is from top to bottom it works with the injected gas to form a pressure core upstream and a low pressure area with an prominent pressure gradient downstream the pressure field in fig 8 shows that the presence of the pressure core creates an equilibrium between gas pressure pore water pressure and capillary pressure preventing direct invasion of upstream water into the desaturated zone and allowing water to flow around the front edge of the desaturated zone when water flows downstream the pressure level drops and only a weak hydraulic gradient can change the flow direction resulting in water invasion into the hpz in case 1 therefore the positional relationship does not affect the inhibition effect of gas injection on the direct inflow of upstream groundwater in the macroheterogeneous reservoir the inflow of groundwater from both sides of the hydraulic fracturing zone should be considered which is crucial in the selection of the gas injection point 3 2 reservoir scale numerical simulation this study increased the model scale to that of the reservoir and performed numerical simulations based on the geological conditions of the pilot project of oil shale in situ exploitation in the fuyu area of china where the gas injection point is in the hpz as shown in fig 9 after gas injection the injected gas tends to flow into the fk1 well along the hpz and on the 10th day the injected gas breaks through in the fk1 well indicating that the fk1 well is now producing gas as the gas injection time is increased a desaturated zone forms between the wells and spreads to both sides after 100 days of gas injection the desaturated zone had evolved nearly into a rectangle with a gas saturation of about 0 3 in the desaturated zone the enrichment of injected gas in the hpz causes the lateral expansion of the desaturated zone therefore when the pressure in the hpz is low injected gas hardly flows to the peripheral zone with low permeability after 280 days of gas injection owing to the increase in pressure level between wells fig 9c demonstrated that the desaturated zone began to expand to the lpz on both sides causing the entire desaturated zone to gradually evolve from a rectangle to an ellipse which is consistent with fig 4d and fig 8c after approximately one year the scope of the desaturated zone had expanded slightly but remained essentially stable owing to the high pressure displacement groundwater bypasses the desaturated zone and flows into the fk1 well along the opposite direction as shown in fig 9d the groundwater flow velocity inside the desaturated zone is low and external groundwater barely infiltrates inwardly the presence of an initial water flow can considerably reduce the flow of injected gas the scope of the desaturated zone is compressed as shown in fig 10 particularly when the gas flow that permeates through the lpz on both sides is inhibited the water flow traces show that the external groundwater flow will flow around when it encounters the desaturated zone with high pressure and part of the groundwater flows into the fk1 well from the low pressure side on the left the findings suggest that the desaturated zone can alter the flow direction of external groundwater thereby reducing its influence on the interwell desaturated zone high temperature pyrolysis zone in the process of in situ exploitation fig 11 depicts the water yield curves of the fk1 well throughout the simulation process the range of the desaturated zone is small during the initial stage of gas injection and the injected gas displaces groundwater into the fk1 well resulting in a large water yield and reaching a peak value of 1400 kg d on the 10th day the desaturated zone has gradually penetrated the fk1 well on the 25th day the desaturated zone began to expand to the left side of the fk1 well narrowing the scope of the saturated area surrounding the fk1 well the water yield then decreased further and gradually stabilized at around 100 kg d on the 100th day however the water yield was relatively higher in the presence of initial water flow than that in the absence of initial water flow the fk2 well has the functions of high pressure gas injection and heat injection in the process of oil shale in situ exploitation therefore the interwell area is the high temperature pyrolysis area during the later stages the considerable reduction in water yield suggests that the surrounding groundwater can be effectively discharged via gas injection a water stopping effect can be formed approximately 25 days after gas injection these findings are consistent with the considerable reduction in water permeability observed in the aforementioned experiments the drainage of the fk1 well was monitored during the in situ exploitation test and the water yield of the fk1 well was maintained at approximately 260 kg d when the in situ pyrolysis exploitation of oil shale was stable when the numerical simulation results are compared to the in situ test results there is a difference in the water yield because the numerical simulation in this study does not account for groundwater infiltration from the top and bottom plates or water produced via oil shale pyrolysis kang et al 2020 wang et al 2014 therefore the calculated water yield is slightly lower than that obtained in the experimental results therefore when the gas injection point in the hpz is set case 3 the expected water stopping effect can be achieved 4 application analysis and suggestions the experimental results show that the positional relationship considerably affects the characteristics of gas water flow and the water stopping effect in porous media with hpz the scheme of the gas injection point inside the fracturing area was adopted in the pilot project of oil shale in situ exploitation to reduce the impact of external groundwater on the pyrolysis area interwell desaturated zone setting the gas injection point at the boundary or inside the hpz will produce the desired water stopping effect the double well pattern one injection well and one production well was used in this study the gas injection well serves as both water stopping and heat injection wells allowing the desaturated zone to coincide with the high temperature pyrolysis zone this demonstrates that relying on a single gas injection well in the hydraulic fracturing area results in a better water stopping effect in the process of large scale oil shale in situ exploitation the distance between gas injection wells for water stopping and the pyrolysis zone must be increased and even select the gas injection wells outside the hydraulic fracturing area the results in fig 4 show that water will flow into the hpz from both sides weakening the water stopping effect this suggests that comprehensive inhibition of groundwater invasion is difficult to achieve with a single gas injection well particularly in large scale oil shale exploitation well groups must be used to form a gas injection barrier the desaturated zones between wells can be linked together even if the gas injection well is located outside the hpz the problem of groundwater invasion from both sides can be solved by relying on well interaction if the distance between gas injection wells is appropriate furthermore it has been discovered that increasing the permeability ratio weakens the water stopping effect of gas injection this finding indicates that increasing permeability in the fracturing area promotes the migration of heat carrying fluid and pyrolysis products but it increases the effect of groundwater invasion on oil shale pyrolysis to reduce the overall difficulty of oil shale in situ exploitation integrating various factors and reasonably determine the degree of hydraulic fracturing is necessary 5 conclusion previously we proposed a marginal gas injection method to break the relationship between the surrounding hydrological environment and the pyrolysis zone this work investigated the gas water flow characteristics and dynamics in 2 d porous media with hpz in relation to the macroheterogeneity of oil shale reservoirs caused by hydraulic fracturing the following are the specific conclusions 1 the gas water flow characteristics were revealed the hpz enriched the injected gas which was the most noticeable in case 3 in cases 2 and 3 the gas inside the hpz could permeate to the lpz on both sides forming two wing tributaries whereas in case 1 water flowed in the opposite direction into the hpz an equal scale simulation was used to validate these findings 2 the gas water flow dynamics were investigated the pressure level in cases 2 and 3 was relatively low and the direction of the local pressure gradient on both sides of the hpz was completely opposite to case 1 the pressure field distribution is the direct cause of gas water flow characteristics 3 the water stopping effect was evaluated the krw distribution exhibited a u shape indicating that the water stopping effect of gas injection was primarily reflected in the hpz furthermore the effect was the greatest when the gas injection point was set at the hpz s boundary or within it reservoir scale simulations and tests confirmed these findings with the water yield dropping to 100 kg d following that the location of gas injection wells

3614,a marginal gas injection method was previously proposed based on two dimensional 2 d homogeneous porous media and the feasibility of isolating the oil shale pyrolysis zone from the surrounding hydrological environment had been demonstrated the gas water flow characteristics and dynamics during gas injection in 2 d porous media with a high permeability zone hpz were studied further based on the presence of a hpz after fracturing oil shale reservoirs a series of experiments were performed when the gas injection point was located outside at the boundary or inside the hpz case1 3 the hpz enriched the injected gas and in cases 2 and 3 the gas inside the hpz permeated to the low permeability zone lpz on both sides forming two wing tributaries however in case 1 water flowed into the hpz in the opposite direction in cases 2 and 3 the direction of the local pressure gradient on both sides of the hpz was completely opposite indicating that the distribution of the pressure field was the direct cause of the gas water flow characteristics therefore the water stopping effect of gas injection is primarily reflected in the hpz additionally the effect was best when the gas injection point was set at the boundary or inside of the hpz these results were verified using reservoir scale simulations and tests in which the water yield decreased to 100 kg d subsequently we recommended the sites of gas injection wells for water stopping all results are expected to provide strategies and theories for dealing with the adverse hydrological environment in large scale oil shale in situ exploitation keywords oil shale gas water flow high permeability zone desaturated zone water stopping 1 introduction oil shale is an abundant unconventional energy resource underground in situ pyrolysis is a technology that ensures clean and efficient exploitation of oil shale with efficient underground oil shale heating at its core brandt 2008 kang et al 2020 sun et al 2015 however the inflow of external groundwater into the high temperature pyrolysis zone reduces heating efficiency sun et al 2019 youhong et al 2021 limiting the development of oil shale in situ pyrolysis technology therefore effectively isolating the in situ pyrolysis zone from the surrounding hydrological environment is a difficult problem that must be solved currently the conventional water stopping methods for specific underground spaces are mainly achieved using grout curtains zhang et al 2014 zhenfang et al 2011 and artificial ground freezing walls agfs alzoubi et al 2020 the grout curtain is used to block pores and fractures by injecting cement slurry underground however owing to the high viscosity of the slurry the diffusion radius of the slurry around a single well is only 1 m with irreversible damage to the original formation structure guo et al 2020 hashimoto et al 2016 the agf method employs low temperature fluids to freeze the formation matrix and pore water using transient heat conduction with phase change followed by seepage channel blockage owing to the heat loss and low heat transfer efficiency the frozen radius is also only 0 5 1 m massarotti et al 2021 zhao et al 2015 therefore the aforementioned two methods have the disadvantages of a small water stopping range and high cost restricting their application in large scale oil shale in situ exploitation underground gas injection is a preferable method to control the unexpected flow of groundwater hence dror et al 2004 and sun and semprich 2013 studied the inhibition of gas injection on saline infiltration into coastal areas xie et al 2018 were the first to employ gas injection in restraining the infiltration of upstream groundwater where the results indicated that this method has the potential to prevent landslides owing to the advantages of underground gas injection we have proposed a marginal gas injection method in previous works to isolat the in situ pyrolysis zone from the surrounding hydrological environment liu et al 2020b sun et al 2019 this method forms a desaturated zone through high pressure gas injection at the edge of the pyrolysis zone and balances the peripheral pore water pressure and capillary pressure with the gas pressure in the desaturated zone to prevent the inflow of surrounding groundwater in the pilot project of oil shale in situ pyrolysis exploitation in the nong an and fuyu areas of china an effective water stopping radius of 20 m was achieved because of the high fluidity of the gas phase previous studies also revealed the characteristics of gas water two phase flow in 2 d homogeneous porous media liu et al 2021a b however after hydraulic fracturing is completed and a proppant support is established proppant filled fractures form along the direction of bedding simplified and regarded as 2 d porous media the high permeability zone hpz will form and the entire reservoir will exhibit macroheterogeneity therefore the investigation of gas water flow characteristics in 2 d porous media with hpz is critical for the use of marginal gas injection for water stopping gas water flow in heterogeneous media is generally used in petroleum engineering zhang et al 2020 carbon dioxide geological storage kazemifar et al 2016 oh et al 2017 air sparging for environmental treatment samani and geistlinger 2019 song et al 2015 yao et al 2020 and other fields the focuses are for recovery fingering phenomena and phase distribution with most of these works based on heterogeneous pores at the micron or nanoscale for example liu et al 2016 focused on the immiscible displacement morphology in heterogeneous pores scholars have studied gas breakthroughs in porous media with heterogeneous wettability and revealed the relationship between the residue of the displaced phase and heterogeneity geistlinger and ataei dadavi 2015 wolf et al 2020 mahmoodi et al 2020 and rezaei et al 2018 investigated the multiphase flow near wellbores with a low permeability skin layer where greater recovery was achieved by increasing the capillary pressure at the outlet in addition previous studies have increasingly focused on the retention of water after hydraulic fracturing and its influence on gas production shen et al 2016 wang and leung 2015 however few studies have focused on the macroheterogeneity caused by hydraulic fracturing particularly the effects of gas injection on water flow characteristics under this condition the macroheterogeneity of fractured oil shale reservoir is fully considered in this study as part of a continuing study of the gas injection barrier we proposed and explored based on 2 d homogeneous porous media gas injection experiments for water stopping were performed using 2 d porous media with hpz and the gas water flow dynamics were analyzed along with an equal scale numerical simulation finally the pilot project of oil shale in situ exploitation in the fuyu area of china was used as an example to conduct reservoir scale numerical simulation for verification this study could provide strategies and theories for dealing with the adverse hydrological environment in large scale oil shale in situ exploitation 2 experimental method and conceptual model 2 1 experimental method the positional relationship between the gas injection point and the hpz caused by hydraulic fracturing will influence the gas water flow characteristics this work focused on the effects of positional relationships on the water stopping effect as well as the effects of the permeability difference between the hpz and the surrounding low permeability zone lpz four schemes of 2 d porous media with hpz were designed for the aforementioned purposes as shown in fig 1 the three positional relationships between the gas injection point and hpz are presented in cases 1 3 the transverse width ratio of the hpz to the entire porous medium is 3 5 and the depth ratios are 1 4 2 4 and 3 4 table 1 presents the physical properties of the glass beads used to construct the porous media a mixture of medium and fine sand was used and the permeability ratio of hpz and lpz is 2 7 corresponding to cases 1 3 case 4 is used to investigate the effects of the difference in permeability in comparison to case 2 the permeability ratio in case 4 is increased to 5 1 indicating a mixture of coarse and fine sand a visual experimental system was adopted in this study and its core is a 2 d porous medium 45 cm 45 cm the thickness under the four schemes is approximately 1 3 1 5 mm five subregions can be created along the vertical flow direction based on the evenly distributed five outlets water flow rates qw of 8 4 15 6 and 22 8 ml min and gas injection flow rates qg of 50 200 500 and 2000 ml min were used to investigate the gas water flow characteristics after the initial water flow in the porous medium was stable gas injection flow rate qg was steadily increased when the steady state was reached after approximately 3 min based on the measured water discharge qwi of each outlet and difference in pressure the relative permeability of water krw of each subregion with i corresponding to the outlets could be calculated using darcy s law therefore the water stopping effect was evaluated using the krw as the index and the two phase distribution was captured using a camera 2 2 conceptual model 2 2 1 equal scale conceptual model in this study tough2 eos3 was utilized to simulate the gas water flow in the porous media talman et al 2004 a previous study validated the module s applicability to the cases implemented in this study sun et al 2019 tough2 provides different models for estimating the relative permeability and capillary pressure the van genuchten mualem model was employed in this study and the relative permeability of the liquid and gaseous phases can be expressed as follows genuchten 1980 1 k rl s 1 1 s 1 λ λ 2 i f s l s ls 1 i f s l s ls 2 k rg 1 s 2 1 s 2 i f s gr 0 1 k rl i f s gr 0 similarly the capillary pressure model can be expressed as follows 3 p cap p 0 s 1 λ 1 1 λ 4 s s l s lr 1 s lr s gr s s l s lr s ls s lr where sl denotes aqueous phase saturation sls and slr denote maximum aqueous phase saturation and aqueous phase residual saturation respectively sgr denotes gas phase residual saturation p0 denotes the capillary entry pressure and λ as well as m represent the fitting parameters the numerical simulation s parameters such as permeability porosity and flow rates are consistent with the experiments because the size of the 2 d experimental model is 45 cm 45 cm 0 14 cm the numerical simulation employs 2 d porous media of the same size a total of 2500 grid elements were divided and a single layer grid was considered along the longitudinal direction therefore the buoyancy of gas was not considered in the experimental process 2 2 2 reservoir scale conceptual model a reservoir scale conceptual model was developed using the pilot project of oil shale in situ exploitation in the fuyu area of china as an example the depth of the oil shale layer is 477 486 m gas injection for water stopping and pyrolysis tests were performed after hydraulic fracturing as shown in fig 2 the hydraulic fracturing area 70 m 20 m is centered on the production well fk1 and gas injection well fk2 the distance between the wells is 15 m zhao et al 2019 during the tests the fk2 well maintained a gas injection pressure of 13 mpa first a high pressure gas injection was used to create an interwell desaturated zone that can act as a water stopping zone and a downhole heat injection under same pressure conditions was used in the same well for the pyrolysis of oil shale therefore in the later stage the high pressure desaturated zone transforms into the high temperature pyrolysis zone a gas circulation pressure of 1 mpa was used to maintain recovery in the fk1 well to achieve real time drainage a 2 d conceptual model was developed based on the geological engineering conditions as shown in fig 3 the model s transverse distance is 100 m its width is 50 m and the hydraulic fracturing area is in the center with fk1 and fk2 wells spaced at 15 m intervals based on the results obtained via the hydrological test the permeability of the interwell reservoir after hydraulic fracturing is approximately 1 md considering that the original rock permeability is one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of the permeability after fracturing the permeability of the original rock area is set at 0 1 md 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of gas water flow the presence of a hydraulic fracturing area will affect the characteristics of gas water flow which will be primarily reflected in two aspects 1 the influence of the positional relationship and 2 the influence of the permeability ratio therefore the targeted investigation is beneficial in optimizing the technical parameters for the anticipated water stopping effect 3 1 1 influence of the positional relationship the positional relationship determines the gas flow path in porous media i e from the lpz to the hpz or vice versa fig 4 shows the distribution of gas and water at different positional relationships and gas flow rates the white area represents the desaturated zone the dark area represents the saturation zone red points represent gas injection points and the white spots on both sides represent reserved holes that have been blocked by glass glue regardless of the positional relationship increasing the gas flow rate increases gas saturation in the desaturated zone the injected gas primarily flows in the hpz implying that the hpz has an enrichment effect on gas flow reddy and adams 2001 with the enrichment effect being more prominent when the gas injection point is located within the hpz in case 1 fig 4a1 d1 shows that as the gas flow rate increases from 50 to 2000 ml min the boundary of the hpz exhibits a prominent high water saturation band this is because when the gas and water flow from the lpz to the hpz the diameter of the pore throat suddenly increases subjecting the water to a large capillary pressure then part of the pore water is bound at the interface as shown in the black box in fig 4c1 almost no gas permeates from the hpz to the lpz on either side which will be explained in detail in the following dynamic analysis because the injected gas initially diffuses outward from the lpz a large amount of gas flows out along the hpz which is a low resistance fluid channel although the desaturated zone covers the entire downstream area owing to the arbitrariness of gas fingering in the initial stage the gas flow velocity outside the hpz will be considerably lower than that inside because approximately 95 of the gas flow is concentrated in the hpz fig 5 in case 2 the pore structure on both sides of the gas injection point exhibit remarkable differences therefore upon gas injection the initial selection of the gas flow path will determine the distribution of gas and water as shown in fig 4a2 d2 the injected gas mostly flows inside the hpz the enrichment effect is more pronounced in this case than that in case 1 when the gas flow rate exceeds 500 ml min the gas flow begins to break through to the lpz as shown in fig 4c2 1 tree shaped gas fingers with the gas injection point as the source are formed upstream and 2 the gas flow inside the hpz permeates to the lpz on both sides forming two wing tributaries as shown by the red boxes and arrows in fig 4 in case 3 the gas water flow characteristics are essentially consistent with the previous two cases and all of the injected gas is essentially enriched in the hpz when the gas flow rate is 2000 ml min part of the gas permeates from both sides of the hpz to the external lpz forming two wing tributaries but no gas permeates upstream the positional relationship influences the gas water flow which in turn influences the water stopping effect of gas injection therefore the change in krw in each subregion was evaluated owing to the limitation of the model size the presence of hpz will affect the initial permeability therefore based on case 2 calculating krw after gas injection eliminates the influence of macroheterogeneity and the results for each subregion are obtained when the gas flow rate is 2000 ml min as shown in fig 5 in any case the enriched gas flow in the hpz is exceeding 90 the high gas saturation in the hpz reduces internal krw considerably whereas it has little effect in the lpz the greater the dynamic water effect the greater the krw in case 1 krw in the hpz is 0 4 whereas in cases 2 and 3 it is 0 1 because of the presence of hpz the distribution of krw in 2 d porous media has a u shape which differs from the v shape distribution observed in a previous study of homogeneous media liu et al 2021b this disparity indicates that in reservoirs with hydraulic fracturing the water stopping effect of gas injection is primarily reflected in the hydraulic fracturing area with the marginal area exhibiting only a limited effect unless the gas flow rate is high 3 1 2 influence of the permeability ratio the hydraulic fracturing area will have different permeabilities owing to hydraulic fracturing technology and degree therefore the permeability of the hpz and original rock area will have different ratios the influence of permeability ratios on two phase flow characteristics and the water stopping effect is investigated further in this study permeability ratios of 2 7 and 5 1 are chosen for qualitative discussion in this experiment fig 6 shows the evolution of gas water flow under a permeability ratio of 5 1 when the gas flow rate is less than 200 ml min gas primarily flows in the hpz and gas fingering is sparser indicating that the gas flow develops as capillary fingering when the gas flow rate exceeds 200 ml min the density of the gas flow increases and viscous fingering develops furthermore until the gas flow rate reaches its maximum only a small amount of gas passes through from the hpz to the marginal lpz and less gas flows upstream when compared to the gas flow distribution in fig 4a2 d2 the results show that increasing the permeability ratio makes it more difficult for gas to flow to the lpz the distribution of krw is depicted in fig 7 the results show that when the water flow rate is 8 4 ml min krw in the hpz is approximately 0 2 and the value gradually increases to approximately 0 4 as the water flow rate increases according to the aforementioned analysis when the permeability ratio is 2 7 even if the water flow rate reaches 22 8 ml min krw can still be maintained at around 0 18 indicating that increasing the permeability ratio increases krw by 50 halving the water stopping effect this difference is caused by the gas water distribution although almost all the injected gas flows through the hpz the gas saturation in the desaturated zone decreases because of the rapid outflow of gas from the outlets and the inhibition of water flow is weakened accordingly 3 1 3 fluid dynamic analysis to further investigate and verify the characteristics of gas water flow in porous media with hpz we performed numerical simulations under the same parameters and conducted a dynamic analysis of gas water flow along with the aforementioned experimental results because pressure gradients control gas water flow in porous media the distribution characteristics of the pressure field and gas saturation determine the gas water flow characteristics as shown in fig 8 the shape of the desaturated zone in cases 1 and 2 is semielliptical which is consistent with fig 4d1 and d2 the gas saturation in the upstream lpz is relatively low which is consistent with the characteristics of the local desaturated zone formed by tree shaped gas fingers in fig 4d2 therefore the simulation results are highly accurate and sufficiently reflect the distribution of the pressure field and water flow velocity in the aforementioned experiments which can reproduce data that are difficult to monitor in the experiments the maximum pressure decreases from 28 kpa to 21 kpa because the area of the hpz increases additionally the positional relationship determines the position of the pressure core in the media in case 1 the pressure core is located outside the hpz and gas flows downstream in a gaussian distribution under the influence of high pressure liu et al 2021b song et al 2015 the enrichment effect occurs when the gas flows through the hpz and only 10 of the gas flows along the lpz on both sides the average pressure in the hpz is 8 kpa which is relatively lower than that in the lpz on both sides and considerably lower than the upstream pressure core of 28 kpa as a result of the pressure gradient the water in the lpz will flow to the hpz by contrast the gas inside the hpz hardly permeates through the lpz against the pressure gradient because of which there is no gas flow outward from the hpz in fig 4c1 d1 in this case the water flow in the lpz on both sides continuously infiltrates into the hpz causing krw to remain constant at 0 4 the blue arrows in fig 8 depict the direction of local water flow in cases 2 and 3 the pressure core gradually transfers from the lpz to the inside of the hpz in this case the gas flows downstream along the hpz after leaving the gas injection point considerably enhancing the enrichment effect furthermore in cases 2 and 3 the average pressure levels in the hpz are 10 kpa and 12 kpa respectively in comparison to case 1 the pressure level increases and the pressure gradient at the permeability transition interface reverses therefore the phenomenon of water flowing to the hpz from both sides vanishes however gas in the hpz permeates both sides because of the pressure gradient which explains the existence of gas tributaries on both sides of the hpz in fig 4d2 and d3 the characteristics of this pressure field can considerably inhibit the invasion of external water into the hpz as shown by the blue arrows the external water flows almost parallel to the boundary of the hpz reducing krw to 0 1 because the initial water flow is from top to bottom it works with the injected gas to form a pressure core upstream and a low pressure area with an prominent pressure gradient downstream the pressure field in fig 8 shows that the presence of the pressure core creates an equilibrium between gas pressure pore water pressure and capillary pressure preventing direct invasion of upstream water into the desaturated zone and allowing water to flow around the front edge of the desaturated zone when water flows downstream the pressure level drops and only a weak hydraulic gradient can change the flow direction resulting in water invasion into the hpz in case 1 therefore the positional relationship does not affect the inhibition effect of gas injection on the direct inflow of upstream groundwater in the macroheterogeneous reservoir the inflow of groundwater from both sides of the hydraulic fracturing zone should be considered which is crucial in the selection of the gas injection point 3 2 reservoir scale numerical simulation this study increased the model scale to that of the reservoir and performed numerical simulations based on the geological conditions of the pilot project of oil shale in situ exploitation in the fuyu area of china where the gas injection point is in the hpz as shown in fig 9 after gas injection the injected gas tends to flow into the fk1 well along the hpz and on the 10th day the injected gas breaks through in the fk1 well indicating that the fk1 well is now producing gas as the gas injection time is increased a desaturated zone forms between the wells and spreads to both sides after 100 days of gas injection the desaturated zone had evolved nearly into a rectangle with a gas saturation of about 0 3 in the desaturated zone the enrichment of injected gas in the hpz causes the lateral expansion of the desaturated zone therefore when the pressure in the hpz is low injected gas hardly flows to the peripheral zone with low permeability after 280 days of gas injection owing to the increase in pressure level between wells fig 9c demonstrated that the desaturated zone began to expand to the lpz on both sides causing the entire desaturated zone to gradually evolve from a rectangle to an ellipse which is consistent with fig 4d and fig 8c after approximately one year the scope of the desaturated zone had expanded slightly but remained essentially stable owing to the high pressure displacement groundwater bypasses the desaturated zone and flows into the fk1 well along the opposite direction as shown in fig 9d the groundwater flow velocity inside the desaturated zone is low and external groundwater barely infiltrates inwardly the presence of an initial water flow can considerably reduce the flow of injected gas the scope of the desaturated zone is compressed as shown in fig 10 particularly when the gas flow that permeates through the lpz on both sides is inhibited the water flow traces show that the external groundwater flow will flow around when it encounters the desaturated zone with high pressure and part of the groundwater flows into the fk1 well from the low pressure side on the left the findings suggest that the desaturated zone can alter the flow direction of external groundwater thereby reducing its influence on the interwell desaturated zone high temperature pyrolysis zone in the process of in situ exploitation fig 11 depicts the water yield curves of the fk1 well throughout the simulation process the range of the desaturated zone is small during the initial stage of gas injection and the injected gas displaces groundwater into the fk1 well resulting in a large water yield and reaching a peak value of 1400 kg d on the 10th day the desaturated zone has gradually penetrated the fk1 well on the 25th day the desaturated zone began to expand to the left side of the fk1 well narrowing the scope of the saturated area surrounding the fk1 well the water yield then decreased further and gradually stabilized at around 100 kg d on the 100th day however the water yield was relatively higher in the presence of initial water flow than that in the absence of initial water flow the fk2 well has the functions of high pressure gas injection and heat injection in the process of oil shale in situ exploitation therefore the interwell area is the high temperature pyrolysis area during the later stages the considerable reduction in water yield suggests that the surrounding groundwater can be effectively discharged via gas injection a water stopping effect can be formed approximately 25 days after gas injection these findings are consistent with the considerable reduction in water permeability observed in the aforementioned experiments the drainage of the fk1 well was monitored during the in situ exploitation test and the water yield of the fk1 well was maintained at approximately 260 kg d when the in situ pyrolysis exploitation of oil shale was stable when the numerical simulation results are compared to the in situ test results there is a difference in the water yield because the numerical simulation in this study does not account for groundwater infiltration from the top and bottom plates or water produced via oil shale pyrolysis kang et al 2020 wang et al 2014 therefore the calculated water yield is slightly lower than that obtained in the experimental results therefore when the gas injection point in the hpz is set case 3 the expected water stopping effect can be achieved 4 application analysis and suggestions the experimental results show that the positional relationship considerably affects the characteristics of gas water flow and the water stopping effect in porous media with hpz the scheme of the gas injection point inside the fracturing area was adopted in the pilot project of oil shale in situ exploitation to reduce the impact of external groundwater on the pyrolysis area interwell desaturated zone setting the gas injection point at the boundary or inside the hpz will produce the desired water stopping effect the double well pattern one injection well and one production well was used in this study the gas injection well serves as both water stopping and heat injection wells allowing the desaturated zone to coincide with the high temperature pyrolysis zone this demonstrates that relying on a single gas injection well in the hydraulic fracturing area results in a better water stopping effect in the process of large scale oil shale in situ exploitation the distance between gas injection wells for water stopping and the pyrolysis zone must be increased and even select the gas injection wells outside the hydraulic fracturing area the results in fig 4 show that water will flow into the hpz from both sides weakening the water stopping effect this suggests that comprehensive inhibition of groundwater invasion is difficult to achieve with a single gas injection well particularly in large scale oil shale exploitation well groups must be used to form a gas injection barrier the desaturated zones between wells can be linked together even if the gas injection well is located outside the hpz the problem of groundwater invasion from both sides can be solved by relying on well interaction if the distance between gas injection wells is appropriate furthermore it has been discovered that increasing the permeability ratio weakens the water stopping effect of gas injection this finding indicates that increasing permeability in the fracturing area promotes the migration of heat carrying fluid and pyrolysis products but it increases the effect of groundwater invasion on oil shale pyrolysis to reduce the overall difficulty of oil shale in situ exploitation integrating various factors and reasonably determine the degree of hydraulic fracturing is necessary 5 conclusion previously we proposed a marginal gas injection method to break the relationship between the surrounding hydrological environment and the pyrolysis zone this work investigated the gas water flow characteristics and dynamics in 2 d porous media with hpz in relation to the macroheterogeneity of oil shale reservoirs caused by hydraulic fracturing the following are the specific conclusions 1 the gas water flow characteristics were revealed the hpz enriched the injected gas which was the most noticeable in case 3 in cases 2 and 3 the gas inside the hpz could permeate to the lpz on both sides forming two wing tributaries whereas in case 1 water flowed in the opposite direction into the hpz an equal scale simulation was used to validate these findings 2 the gas water flow dynamics were investigated the pressure level in cases 2 and 3 was relatively low and the direction of the local pressure gradient on both sides of the hpz was completely opposite to case 1 the pressure field distribution is the direct cause of gas water flow characteristics 3 the water stopping effect was evaluated the krw distribution exhibited a u shape indicating that the water stopping effect of gas injection was primarily reflected in the hpz furthermore the effect was the greatest when the gas injection point was set at the hpz s boundary or within it reservoir scale simulations and tests confirmed these findings with the water yield dropping to 100 kg d following that the location of gas injection wells for water stopping was recommended credit authorship contribution statement zhao liu conceptualization investigation writing original draft youhong sun conceptualization resources qiang li methodology
