18480,biofilm formation causes bias in dissolved oxygen do sensors which hamper their usage for automatic control and thereby balancing energy and treatment efficiency we analysed if a dataset that was generated with deliberate perturbations can automatically be interpreted to detect bias caused by biofilm formation we used a challenging set up with realistic conditions that are required for a full scale application this included automated training adapting to changing normal conditions and automated tuning setting an alarm threshold to assure that the fault detection fd methods are accessible to the operators the results showed that automatic usage of fd methods is difficult especially in terms of automatic tuning of alarm thresholds when small training datasets only represent the normal conditions i e clean sensors despite the challenging set up two fd methods successfully improved the detection limit to 0 5 mg do l bias caused by biofilm formation we showed that the studied dataset could be interpreted equally well by simpler fd methods as by advanced machine learning algorithms this in turn indicates that the information contained in the actively generated data was more vital than its interpretation by advanced algorithms graphical abstract image 1 keywords active fault detection monitoring receiver operating characteristics gaussian process regression one class classification 1 introduction we studied how fault detection fd methods automatically can detect bias in dissolved oxygen do sensors caused by biofilm fouling we evaluate how a limited but from an operator perspective realistic amount of quality checked training data impacts the training and performance of fd methods we use the dataset in samuelsson et al 2018 that were generated in line with the concept active fault detection afd which is so far an unexplored concept for wastewater applications 1 1 the importance of verifying do sensor readings monitoring the condition of sensors and their related data quality in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs is essential especially when used for automatic control the do sensor is a key sensor to monitor for two reasons i a bias has a direct effect on aeration energy and or treatment efficiency and ii the usage of do sensors is widespread with multiple sensors in a standard wrrf the workload for do sensor maintenance is thus expected to make up a large proportion of the total sensor maintenance time 1 2 pushing state of the art for monitoring do sensors in samuelsson et al 2018 we studied biofilm formation fouling and its effect on the two common measurement types of do sensors namely membrane electrochemical mec and optical opt sensors the results showed that a bias above 1 0 mg l due to biofilm formation could be detected with a simple rise time estimation method rt for the opt sensor we concluded that other fd methods than rt needs to be evaluated to detect lower bias levels and biofilm fouling faster which is the purpose of this study in this study we aim to improve the detection limit to 0 5 mg l bias which we believe is satisfactory for an early warning system but still challenging in the light of previous results 1 3 informative data from active fault detection a novel part of the work in samuelsson et al 2018 was that the data from the do sensors were generated in line with the concept afd a concept recently reviewed by puncochár and skach 2018 the afd is centred around designing a test signal which is physically implemented operationalized to perturb the studied system in a controlled manner the purpose of the test signal is to increase the diagnostic information content in data without interfering with normal operation in samuelsson et al 2018 the test signal was a short impulse and implemented as pressurized air from the sensor s automatic air cleaning system the short impulse temporary increases the sensor s ambient do concentration and has been denoted an impulse response ir similar ideas as afd have been introduced including system identification ljung 1999 on line modelling vanrolleghem 1994 adaptive automatic control seborg et al 1986 and reinforcement learning buşoniu et al 2008 at the heart of these ideas lies experimental signal design to produce information that is optimal according to some criterion see fedorov 2010 for an overview of optimal experimental design oed the close relationship between oed system identification and adaptive automatic control has been reviewed in pronzato 2008 although fault detection applications were not considered the afd has been used to improve classical fault detection strategies i detection of changed model parameter nikoukhah and campbell 2008 ii diagnosis with multiple failure models campbell et al 2002 iii and residual generation padilla and choinière 2015 we expect that oed can be useful for further developing afd since optimality criteria have been described both for optimal parameter estimation that relate to i a d and e optimal fedorov 2010 and model discrimination t optimal atkinson and fedorov 1975 that relate to ii the merits of using oed would however be limited to optimizing models representing normal conditions as faulty data are infeasible to obtain in practice especially during an iterative oed procedure we believe that afd can be especially suitable for wrrf applications a dedicated test signal with high and controllable excitation should be able to produce data with large signal to noise ratio here noise refers to the normal daily seasonal and influent flow dependent variations that in general makes it hard to detect sensor anomalies during normal operation conducting automated test signals enables exact repeatability and precision which contrasts to manual checks performed by operators 1 4 automatic fault detection requires annotated training data fd methods valuable in practice both need to have good detection performance high detection rate low false alarm rate and to be practically feasible from an operator s perspective practically feasible means simple to use under existing conditions with little extra workload automated training adapting to training data and tuning setting the alarm threshold are therefore desirable however an automated training tuning procedure in turn requires timely access to accurately annotated training data here we refer to annotated data as data labelled either normal or faulty that represent the system s sensor state the degree of required annotation ranges from complete annotation both faulty and normal classes annotated to unannotated data depending on which fd method that is used so called supervised classification methods exploit annotated data from both classes in contrast to unsupervised methods that exploit data without annotation see e g bishop 2006 fd methods that only use data from one class only commonly from the normal mode are called one class classification methods pimentel et al 2014 in short the higher degree of annotation in training data the easier the fault detection task becomes since more information is available about the difference between a fault and the normal condition annotated data unfortunately are scarce in practice the reason for lack of faulty annotated data is clear faults should be rare but even when faults are present annotation is problematic it is difficult and time consuming to identify the starting time of e g a sensor fault there is seldom a clear cut transition between the normal and the faulty mode the definition of what is faulty is subjective and depends on the context also normal annotated data are challenging data considered to be normal during daily operations often contain unknown flaws which make them unrepresentative for the normal state and therefore also unsuitable for fd method training 1 5 challenges and our solutions the goal with our study is to improve the detection level to 0 5 mg l bias on do sensors for the data in samuelsson et al 2018 further we conduct our study with realistic constraints that are needed to be solved in a full scale implementation which include timely access to annotated training data automated tuning of alarm thresholds using a realistic amount of annotated normal data automated training to allow the fd methods to adapt to changing normal conditions such as worn sensor and or seasonal variations we address these challenges by labelling data from the 24 h period after manual sensor verification as being normal using small 24 h normal annotated data for fd method training only consider automated training and tuning procedures with minimal data pre processing and end user input decisions we assess how both supervised and unsupervised fd methods can be modified to analyse unconventional data with irs generated with afd note that only normal training data are considered further we combine the performance measure receiver operating characteristics roc see kay 1998 with a data transformation model in venkatasubramanian et al 2003 to get insights in the interplay between data and fd methods the majority studies considering afd have been theoretical simulation studies with few real world applications this study is one of few where real data are considered and to our knowledge the first one with a wrrf application this study therefore pushes the state of the art knowledge of the applicability of afd to real systems we finally stress that afd is a different approach compared to previous research in the field which has so far been driven by interpreting and combining existing data see e g the review by corominas et al 2018 2 materials and methods this section is structured as follows section 2 1 gives an overview of the datasets in samuelsson et al 2018 and section 2 2 describe how they were evaluated here in terms of training and test data section 2 3 explains introduce a data transformation model that was used to assess the performance of the fd methods the choice of fd methods is motivated in section 2 4 and a technical description of the fd methods can be found in appendix a 2 1 data an overview of the datasets used in this study is given in this section but details can be found in samuelsson et al 2018 an ir is here defined as a 60 s long data sequence with temporary elevated do values from a do sensor which has been subjected to a 20 s long impulse of pressurized air fig 1 a the 60 s ir time frame starts jointly with the air impulse the qualitative shape of an ir has been shown to be informative about the extent of biofilm fouling on the sensor fig 1b it is the task for the fd methods to differentiate between normal and fouled irs that cause a bias two datasets from samuelsson et al 2018 were used in this study one with artificial grease fouling denoted dart and one with real biofilm formation denoted dreal the dart was produced by recording irs at different locations in a conventional activated sludge process asp with varying degrees of manually applied grease film as an imitation of biofilm formation in total dart contain 50 normal and 2628 fouled irs the dreal was produced in a different wrrf than dart where real biofilm formation on sensors is problematic the dreal contains six experimental periods each one with a length between 10 and 62 days each experimental period started with a clean sensor and the extent of biofilm formation increased until the sensor was manually cleaned and the next experimental period begun in both datasets the bias at different levels of fouling was obtained as the difference between the measured do concentration in the fouled sensor before an ir and the value from a clean reference do sensor that measures close to the fouled sensor in dart only do sensors of mec type were fouled but in dreal both mec and opt sensors were fouled and evaluated 2 2 realistic and automated training procedure as mentioned in section 1 4 it is essential to develop practically feasible fd methods meaning that realistic constraints need to be tackled three such constraints are critical to automate the usage of fd methods i timely access to annotated normal data ii automatic training to adapt to changing normal conditions iii automatic tuning of alarm threshold note that we distinguish between training adapting the fd method to normal conditions and tuning setting the alarm threshold for a desired trade off between sensitivity and robustness in the following five sections we motivate why the constraints in our study are realistic and reflect solutions available for a full scale implementation the two datasets in this study were used for different purposes with different training and evaluation procedures which are described in section 2 2 4 2 2 5 note that all fd methods were given the exact same raw data and conditions for tuning training and evaluation minimal data pre processing was applied where only outliers less than 10 irs in total were initially removed the removed ir outliers contained partly frozen signals caused by data transfer problems 2 2 1 timely access to annotated normal training data we defined the 24 h after an approved manual sensor verification as normal data and argue that within 24 h it is reasonable to assume that no fouling or sensor wearing has occurred here a verification consisted of manual cleaning and compensation for potential bias due to drift after the last verification sensor verification was conducted in the beginning of each experimental period in dreal and for all normal irs in dart in full scale sensor maintenance information system date and time for manual cleaning and calibration are stored and provide the necessary information for sensor verification such data can automatically be transferred to a fd method as a realistic solution for providing the required normal annotated data the number of training irs was limited to 12 to only use realistic small training datasets the reason was that 24 h of normal annotated training data only contain 12 irs per sensor when the sensor supplier s recommendation of 2 hour cleaning interval is applied too frequent air cleaning wears the sensor out and would also reduce the time when the do sensor can be used for automatic control during the 2 3 min of air cleaning the do sensor is not sensing the true do concentration 2 2 2 automatic training to adapt to changing normal conditions it is important to have automatic procedures to compensate for non stationarity in wrrf process data seasonal variations and wear in sensor that may cause changes in its ir in this study and for a potential full scale application we assumed that the 12 irs 24 h after a sensor verification were accessible for automatic re training the fd methods in practice sensor verifications and re training are expected to occur in intervals of 2 4 weeks which is enough to adapt to seasonal variations in data and wearing in sensor 2 2 3 automatic alarm threshold tuning we used the off line approach described by gustafsson 2000 to set the alarm threshold for all fd methods the approach requires the user to specify a desired false alarm rate provide a normal dataset and an acceptable range for the alarm threshold thereafter an automated procedure is conducted where all alarm thresholds in the acceptable range are evaluated with respect to false alarm rates on the normal dataset the alarm threshold closest to the desired one is chosen for the on line application the implicit assumption for the approach is that the normal training dataset is representative for the full probability distribution of the normal mode this means that a training dataset with 12 irs is too small to use for tuning purposes we however expect that it is a realistic effort for an operator to produce a larger training dataset about 1 week s data once every year with the purpose of tuning the alarm threshold it is an open question whether each do sensor would need individual tuning or if the same dataset and tuning could be used for all sensors of equal types 2 2 4 dataset dreal training tuning and performance assessment the dreal was evaluated to imitate realistic and automated full scale usage of the assessed fd methods the first experimental period period 1 was used as off line normal data to tune the fd methods to a 10 false alarm rate the 10 threshold was chosen slightly higher than what is desired in a full scale application where 1 5 is more reasonable the purpose with a 10 alarm limit was to simplify the interpretation of the results e g it is not possible to evaluate whether a fd method that have much lower false alarm rates on test data than 1 for the experimental periods 2 5 the first 12 irs in each period where used for training as described in section 2 2 2 and the remaining irs for evaluation false alarm rate and detection rate were used as performance measures for the evaluation note that the 10 desired false alarm rate was the only part specified by the researchers all remaining training and tuning steps were conducted in an automated way without subjective interference 2 2 5 dataset dart training and performance assessment the dart was used to assess the performance of the fd methods with equal amount of training data as for dreal 12 irs but without tuning the alarm threshold instead the full range of possible alarm thresholds was evaluated for both false alarm and detection rates and visualized in a graph a graph where each point on the curve corresponds to a false alarm probability x axis and detection probability y axis for a specific alarm threshold is known as receiver operating characteristics roc see kay 1998 the roc enables an assessment of detection performances between fd methods with optimal alarm thresholds where only the interplay of training data and fd methods are assessed we use the term optimal alarm thresholds since the value for the alarm threshold can differ for different training and test datasets which is not applicable in practice the ranges of alarm threshold for all fd methods are provided in the supplementary materials in table 2 the roc curve can be evaluated in terms of a scalar measure by integrating for the area underneath the roc curve auc here we considered the partial area under curve p a u c α up to a false alarm ratio α the reason for only considering part of the auc area was that it is only fd methods with low false alarm rate that are relevant for practical implementations the actual evaluation was conducted by randomly selecting 12 training irs from the 50 normal irs the remaining 38 normal and 2628 faulty irs where used to compute results for the roc curve the evaluation was repeated four times with different training irs to get indications about how sensitive the results are based on the selection of training data 2 3 transforming data to diagnostic information as described by venkatasubramanian et al 2003 any diagnostic decision making process can be described by its underlying data transformation process see fig 2 traditional fd methods are designed to maximize the diagnostic information content from existing raw process data in afd the information content in raw data is increased by a priori knowledge of the system and diagnostic problem which is used to design an appropriate test signal further it is the subsequent combination of data transformation steps that decide the overall diagnostic performance of any fd method note that the information flow is in one direction from left to right in fig 2 thus lost information in one early data space cannot be recovered in subsequent steps this highlights why the afd has potential since it is the first step excitation space in the data transformation process in this study we used the data transformation process as a tool to separate different parts of a fd method and thereby allow increased insights into why some fd methods fail or not one relevant example concerns the alarm threshold class space and the roc curve feature space if good performance for a fd method is obtained in decision space but poor performance in class space this indicates that it is the tuning of the alarm threshold that fails the characteristics and separation of data spaces for all fd methods are described in table 1 in appendix a 2 4 fault detection methods in this section we motivate the choice of fd methods a detailed description of the evaluated fd methods is given in appendix a state of the art fd methods potentially give better detection performance at the risk of being more complicated compared to simple fd methods complicated fd methods are however more costly with regards to operator training method usage and tuning and on line integration implementation debugging and data storage thus a cost effective fd method is a trade off between complexity and detection performance we therefore compared four fd methods of varying degree of complexity namely the pragmatic engineering approach pea response time estimation rt principal component analysis pca and gaussian process regression gpr the pea was a straight forward usage of the descriptive statistics mean and standard deviation the rt have been described and evaluated in samuelsson et al 2018 and thus serves as baseline performance for the other fd methods the pca is the most cited fd method in wrrf applications corominas et al 2018 and one of few fd methods that has actually been implemented on line in wrrfs see wade et al 2005 the mathematics of pca are well known and have been described e g in the tutorial review by bro and smilde 2014 and specifically for wrrf applications in haimi 2016 thus pca is expected to be familiar to some wrrf operators and relevant as benchmarking method the most advanced fd method in this study was gpr which is a state of the art pattern recognition algorithm that has been widely spread in the machine learning community see rasmussen and williams 2005 and its citations the gpr has also been described and introduced to wrrf applications in samuelsson et al 2017 we expected gpr to be the best method since it is properties should make it ideal to model changes in the shape of an ir in addition gpr produce uncertainty intervals in its default from that are useful for automatically tuning alarm thresholds we expected that the ambient do concentration before an ir denoted initial do concentration should impact the height of the ir therefore we added the feature initial do concentration to all fd methods and thereby creating several variants of the four fd methods see appendix a for a detailed summary we were especially interested in evaluating different variants of gpr since it was the most advanced method that was also the least studied fd method for wrrf applications for the gpr the initial do concentration in combination with the ir was used to construct a two dimensional non linear regression model for the shapes of irs we expected that this should be a flexible and successful model that could differ any changes in the irs due to fouling from normal irs we compared two two dimensional gpr variants gpr2se and gpr2ard see appendix for details with two one dimensional variants gpr1sebf and gpr1selr the one dimensional variants had a different detection mechanism in terms of decision variables where the likelihood ratio between training irs and test irs was used as decision variable this is not the standard way to use gpr for fd and we were curious whether such measure could be better than the two dimensional variants we provide a detailed description of the gpr variants in appendix a 3 results and discussion the results for all fd methods on dreal and dart are jointly shown and discussed we focus on three key topics 1 detection performances of the fd methods in terms of detecting the desired 0 5 mg l bias section 3 1 3 3 3 4 and 3 7 and avoiding false alarms section 3 2 2 complications that are related to automatic tuning and training in section 3 2 1 3 2 2 3 5 and 3 6 3 transferability to a full scale applications and related aspects section 3 8 the results on dart fig 3 give an overview of the general performance ordering of all fd methods the detection performances on dreal are provided for the two sensor types opt and mec in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively detailed results such as tuning and detection performances for all methods and datasets are given in table 1 3 1 the best performing fd methods a bias larger than 0 5 mg l was successfully detected in dreal for the opt sensor with a low number of false alarms with the three simplest fd methods pea rt and rti fig 4 only gpr2se gave good results disregarding period 2 on the same data among the more advanced gpr and pca methods similarly the pea rt rti and gpr2se also performed well on dart fig 3 the mec sensor on dreal fig 5 only obtained a bias above 0 5 mg l for minor parts of period 2 and 5 and it was therefore mainly false alarm rates that could be evaluated we believe that it is interesting that the advanced methods were not superior to the basic methods we expected both pca and gpr to improve the interpretation of the irs compared to the basic rt that only use one point from the ir whereas pca and gpr analyse the full ir our initial assumption was that when only small training datasets are available it should become even more important with advanced fd methods that can squeeze out any available information the results here do not support our initial assumption and indicate that the added workload of using advanced fd methods is not motivated for this application 3 2 false alarm distribution on mec sensor data a general challenge with fd methods is to reduce false alarms and understand their source there are many potential explanations for the abundance of false alarms for the mec sensor data in fig 5 where the most obvious are influence from varying initial do concentration during test periods grey line fig 5 non representative tuning data resulting in a inappropriate alarm thresholds obtained during period 1 the tuning period we focused on understanding the source of false alarms for the best performing fd methods as reported in section 3 1 i e pea rt rti and gpr2se 3 2 1 impact of initial do concentration both rti and gpr2se had fewer false alarms in period 5 compared to period 4 despite a dramatic variation in the initial do concentration between 3 and 6 mg l period 5 see fig 5 this is the opposite of would be expected if the initial do concentration during test periods was the reason for the false alarms during day 38 in period 4 all four fd methods gave false alarms when the do concentration was abruptly increased these results indicate that sudden changes in the do concentration can produce false alarms although it was not the main reason for false alarms for rti and gpr2se our explanation is that both rti and gpr2se made use of the initial do concentration as a feature and could therefore avoid false alarms due to varying do concentrations this explanation is strengthened by the fact that rt and pea that did not use initial do concentration as a feature table 1 in appendix a and had more false alarms in period 5 3 2 2 interaction between tuning training data and alarm threshold values to study whether the training data were representative for normal conditions we compared the variation in the 12 training irs for all experimental periods period 2 5 the training data differed in initial do concentration see supplementary materials figs 1 5 and interestingly period 4 with most false alarms had the smallest spread in initial do concentration in its training dataset to test the influence of spread in initial do concentration in training data on false alarm rates we replaced three irs in the original training data with irs with either a smaller or larger spread in initial do concentration the spread was increased in period 4 and reduced in period 5 and we then repeated the evaluation see supplementary materials figs 6 and 7 if insufficient spread in training data was the underlying cause for the false alarm rates an increase in the spread for training data would reduce the false alarm rate and imply that larger variations in the irs in test data are accepted as normal the opposite argumentation applies for period 5 where we reduced the spread compared to the original training data the revaluated results showed that changing the spread in initial do concentration in training data had a clear effect on the false alarm rates see fig 8 in supplementary materials the gpr2se and rti dramatically decreased their false alarm rates in period 4 gpr2se from 29 to 8 and rti from 41 to 1 in period 5 the false alarm rates increased from 14 to 18 gpr2se and from 6 to 52 rti when the spread instead was decreased neither pea nor rt were affected by the spread in initial do concentrations in training data this was reasonable since neither of them used the initial do concentration explicitly in feature space and they should therefore not be affected by a changed spread in the initial do concentration we conclude that sufficient spread in initial do concentration in training data was necessary to reduce false alarms for both gpr2se and rti we hypothesize that sufficient should be put in relation to the ratio in variations between training and tuning data 3 3 the one dimensional gpr variants the one dimensional gpr variants gpr1sebf and gpr1selr had better performance than gpr2ard but worse than all other fd methods on dart fig 3 the results showed that the marginal likelihood was not a good feature to separate normal from fouled irs the separation between normal and faulty distributions in feature space sets an upper limit for the performance in the next data spaces decision and class space it was therefore not surprising that none of the one dimensional gpr variants gave good results on dreal figs 4 5 where also class space is included in addition they had non robust performance on dart and on the test periods similarly as the gpr2ard variant in the end the one dimensional gpr variants had worse performance than the simple rt and pea and were therefore not considered further 3 4 two dimensional gpr variants we previously noted that gpr2se had good detection performance but missed the faults in period 2 reconsider the opt sensor data in fig 4 similarly as on the opt sensor data gpr2se had one iteration with deviating poor results on dart also gpr2ard had varying performance although with poor results in general we repeated the evaluation for gpr2se and gpr2ard 10 times on the opt sensor data which showed that their performance varied supplementary materials fig 9 since it was only the fd method training albeit the same training data that differed between the 10 iterations we conclude that the varying performance for both gpr2se and gpr2ard was an effect of the stochastic properties in the method this was surprising since the particle filter variant of gpr has been shown to produce robust results see samuelsson et al 2017 note that the only difference between gpr2ard and gpr2se was that the ard kernel allowed separate parameter values for both dimensions in contrast to the se kernel which used equal parameter values for both dimensions see appendix a for the technical description of gpr the additional flexibility in the ard kernel was clearly a drawback and decreased the gpr2 s performance from good gpr2se to worse than what would have been obtained by chance compare gpr2ard with ctd in fig 3 3 5 the tunability problem in this section we define the tunability problem as when the desired false alarm rate is not reached for a fd method on a given dataset regardless of alarm threshold value that is used the automatic off line tuning procedure described in section 2 2 relied upon obtaining a user specified false alarm rate to tune the fd methods the results however showed that this was not applicable for all fd methods an example of the tunability problem was for rt and rti which were tuned to 2 false alarm rate in contrast to the desired 10 compare false alarm rates in p1 first row in table 1 the reason for rt and rti not to be tuned at 0 1 was because it was not possible to separate 10 of the normal irs in the tuning dataset in period 1 while iterating within the given range of alarm threshold values i e the rise time limit the tunability problem was present in other fd methods as well gpr1sebf and gp2ard in the opt sensor data and also in the mec sensor data rt gpr2se gpr2ard if considering a 5 percent unit deviation from desired false alarm rate as acceptable for the rt the reason was a too low sampling time of 1 s which in practice round off all rise time values to full seconds that in turn made it difficult to separate small differences in irs to conclude it was the insufficient separation of normal training data in feature space that was the cause for the undesired tuning and not poorly chosen threshold values in class space we expect the tunability problem to increase if lower false alarm rates such as 1 are required also if 1 alarm rate is desired with one detected ir the minimal number tuning dataset would be 100 irs 8 days from the results it seems like the tuning dataset also need to contain irs spread out in the assumed normal distribution we don t necessary refer to a gaussian distribution we conclude that the suggested approach for tuning is inappropriate for this application and likely also similar applications with small tuning datasets 3 6 inconsistent detection performance disregarding the tunability problem and that not all fd methods obtained 0 1 false alarm rate it is still desirable that they at least obtain similar false alarm rates during the test periods period 2 5 as during the tuning period period 1 such behaviour indicates predictable false alarm rates based on the tuning and provides confidence that data transformation from measurement space to class space is consistent with different data however none of the nine fd methods produced consistent results with regards to both false alarms and detection rates at all test periods table 1 a subjective assessment should also be made by studying the location of false alarms and detection rates with respect to their proximity of fault and normal periods we would get more confident in fd methods producing early detections close to the fault period compared to randomly spread out false alarms based on such subjective assessment we can see that only pea rt and rti in the opt sensor data fig 4 gave reasonable results and none of the fd methods gave convincing results for all test periods in the mec sensor data fig 5 the inconsistent performance would be a major drawback in a full scale application since it is critical that the operators gain trust in the fd method at hand to use it potentially the consistency could be improved with more representative training data as discussed in section 3 2 2 the fact that all studied fd methods gave inconsistent performance supports the indication that the problem is related to training data rather than the fd methods 3 7 the pca variants the two pca variants were the best performing fd methods on dart and had close to optimal pauc0 1 performance table 1 and fig 3 but gave poor results too many false alarms on dreal figs 4 5 the reason for the discrepancy was unsatisfactory tuning of alarm threshold values here the unsatisfactory tuning refers to too tight threshold value with respect to the non faulty training data resulting in many false alarms in dreal the discrepancy can be understood by first reconsidering the near optimal performance in dart the key to this result was that the threshold value was varied to obtain all possible detection performances combinations of false alarm and detection ratios and not fixed as in dreal the roc evaluation thus provides a measure of separation between normal and faulty distributions for a given combination av data transformation steps an additional indication that pca produced good mode probability distribution separation was that neither of the pca variants suffered from the tunability problem and achieved the desired false alarm rates within 5 percent units in all datasets this was however obtained with the cost of also changing the threshold values between the iterations in dart table 1 especially the first iteration had deviating threshold values in several orders of magnitude compared to the other iterations one ir with a different shape was present in the training data in the first iteration see supplementary materials fig 10 and was assumed to be the reason for the deviating threshold values in addition the varying threshold values were non intuitive with values in the range of 1e 3 to 1e 13 and far from the commonly used 0 95 confidence level to conclude the results in this study indicate that pca successfully separated the faulty and normal data distributions although it was not possible in practice to use a fixed alarm threshold for different training and test datasets the pca needs to be further studied on how to tune and set alarm threshold values in relation to training data 3 8 topics for do sensor monitoring on a full scale which fd method had sufficiently convincing results and are there problems that need to be solved to put the fd methods in production on a full scale it was clear that the automatic tuning procedure needs to be improved and that the false alarm rates need to be suppressed which are key problems to handle in a full scale application we suggest three solutions to reduce the problems with false alarms i require a certain number of consecutive alarms before an alarm is raised this would remove random alarms at the cost of a delayed detection ii two or more fd methods are combined in an ensemble monitoring system to increase the robustness towards false alarms iii the test signal should be improved to take into account that training and tuning data are produced so that a wide range of initial do concentrations are include in the training data if possible despite the manufacturer s recommendation the size of training datasets should be increased from the results it is clear that achieving automatic tuning of fd methods with small training and tuning datasets is difficult as mentioned in section 3 2 2 an increased focus on producing training datasets with larger spread in initial do concentration could improve the training procedure and probably also the tuning procedure we therefore believe that it is more important to improve the test signal and the information content in the irs rather than developing better fd methods unfortunately a more advanced design procedure for obtaining annotated training and tuning data is unrealistic for a full scale application since more time and efforts are required more research on strategies for automatic tuning with small normal annotated datasets is needed future studies should also compare how a human expert can interpret the ir s in comparison to the best fd method such comparison would serve as a sanity check for how good detection performance that at least can be obtained from the data that is if a human expert outperforms the best fd method there is room for improving the fd method recent research has demonstrated that algorithms can produce better detection performance than human experts see e g haenssle et al 2018 and it would be interesting to study whether similar results could be obtained for the given data in this study as well the costs and benefits of using the fd methods need to be put into relation to the time for the cost of simply increasing the manual sensor maintenance interval we expect the cost for a false alarm in terms of too early sensor cleaning to be small compared to a using a do sensor with 0 5 mg l bias for aeration control the cost in terms of lost confidence from the operators due to false alarms is however expected to be high even if the human operator can make a good visual control about the biofilm formation on a sensor we believe that automated fd methods still are valuable tools as an example consider a fd method that provide reliable information about the sensor condition and likewise its data quality such information can be of great use to prioritize which sensor to check and maintain when time is scarce further automated generation of data quality indices for many sensors can also provide quantifiable information about e g which lines or zones that are more suspect to fouling which in turn can be used to improve a fixed sensor maintenance schedule automatic and objective storage of the condition for many sensors is time consuming and a task that is better suited for automated fd methods rather than for human operators 4 conclusions active fault detection can provide timely information about biofilm formation on do sensors and it is a promising concept to improve sensor maintenance two fd methods rti and gpr2se reached the goal to improve the detection limit to 0 5 mg l bias caused by biofilm fouling the detection performance was more related to how good the training data represented the normal variations rather than how advanced the fd method was further the study illustrated that it is difficult to conduct automatic fault detection especially to tune the alarm threshold when only small normal training datasets are available more research is needed to solve how training data can be made representative for the normal conditions and included in the active fault detection

should be intuitive to understand and straight forward to implement the pea first normalizes the training irs by subtracting their respective initial do concentration then the mean ir m e a n and standard deviation values ir s d at each time point are calculated to define the normal behaviour of an ir the final step before running the algorithm on test data ir t e s t is to decide the number of standard deviation values by tuning the threshold value β that defines the detection limit the relation between these steps and the data spaces is given in table 1 rise time estimation rt the rt computes the time for an ir to reach 63 percent of its peak value see details in andersson and hallgren 2015 samuelsson et al 2018 in this study we include an additional variant rti that also made use of the initial do concentration d o i of training and test irs to compensate for a potential effect from different initial do concentrations the rti used the least squares linear regression of the correlation between initial do concentration and time constant values for the 12 training irs the decision limits were then based on the prediction intervals from the least squares estimate according to a 1 r t i d o i l i m r t i d o i γ i s s r t i 1 1 12 d o i d o i 2 s s d o i where the detection limits depend on the initial do concentration of a test ir the rt i do i is the mean predicted rise time based on the initial do concentration of a test ir do i and the γ i is a threshold value to be tuned the term after γ i is the standard error of prediction which contain the mean squared error for the regression residuals s s r t i and the mean squared sum of the training initial do concentrations s s d o i principal component analysis pca in short pca extracts key linear correlations from the sample covariance matrix of correlated variables deviations from the normal covariance structure are used as indication for a fault in this study pca was applied to the irs where each time step from an ir 1 60 s was treated as an individual variable the data were standardized to zero mean and standard deviation one two principal components were used as they contained at least 95 of the variation during a 10 fold cross validation based on training data from period 1 in dreal two pca variants with different decision spaces were considered the standard variant pcastand used the common hotelling s t2 index and squared prediction error spe as decision variables whereas the second variant pcacomb combined t2 and spe to one decision variable denoted φ as in yue and qin 2001 the pcastand was implemented with threshold value with χ 2 distribution for the critical t2 limit and the robust spe limit from varmuza and filzmoser 2009 the threshold value for φ was based on ϝ distribution for the t2 limit and χ 2 distribution for the spe which gave less restrictive limits compared to the pcastand the confidence level α was used as tunable alarm threshold value for both pca variants see table 1 gaussian process regression gpr the gpr has been detailed in e g rasmussen and williams 2005 and represents the state of the art fd method in this study and is therefore the least studied algorithm applied to wrrf applications and afd data it is hence of interest to understand how variants of gpr can be applied to afd data and impact its performance in short gpr can be described as a non linear regression method that performs a smooth interpolation of training data the gpr also produces a data dependent prediction interval were both the mean prediction and the prediction interval are based on the assumption that data can be described as a gaussian process i e a multivariate normal distribution the gpr was modified to four variants that differed in both feature and decision space table 1 the first two variants gpr1sebf and gpr1selr only made use of the irs as feature one dimension whereas the remaining two gpr2se and gpr2ard also included the initial do concentration as a second feature variable two dimensional indicated with a lowercase 2 the difference between the latter two variants was two different kernels the standard squared exponential se and the automatic relevance detection kernel ard the difference is that the ard have separate kernel parameter for every dimension in contrast to the se kernel that uses the same length and variance parameters for all dimensions note that since both the se and the ard have same kernel construction the gpr1se would be identical to gpr1ard the kernel is an important design choice in gpr and can be described as a parametrized covariance matrix see bishop 2006 for an introduction to kernels a critical step in training gpr is to infer the kernel parameters from data the most common approach relies on maximum likelihood estimation mle rasmussen and williams 2005 various bayesian approaches also exist that make probabilistic approximations of the kernel parameter distributions e g by using particle filters in this study we used both approaches where the mle approach from rasmussen and nickisch 2010 was used in gpr1selr and the particle filter implementation gpr smc in svensson et al 2015 was used in gpr2se gpr2ard and gpr1sebf to allow a fair comparison the mle approach was repeated equally many times as the number of particles in the bayesian approach also the gpr smc was modified to add a small probability value of 1 0e 14 to zero probabilities in the in uniform distribution during kernel parameter sampling to avoid numerical problems the settings for the gpr variants are provided in the supplementary materials in table 1 the difference between gpr1selr and gpr1sebf was in the decision space which also differed from the two dimensional variants for the two dimensional variants the standard gpr approach was applied which make use of the prediction intervals i e the mean prediction g p m e a n and the standard deviation g p s d of the predictive normal distribution as decision limits table 1 the width of the prediction interval alarm threshold value was tuned by deciding the number of standard deviations δ in the prediction interval for the one dimensional variants it was not straight forward how to infer the kernel parameters especially since all training data had equivalent time values t 1 60 here we assumed that training data 12 irs were independent realizations from one underlying gaussian process a 2 p y 1 y n m p y 1 m p y n m where p y 1 y n m is the joint probability of datasets 1 to n given a gpr model m the decision variable for gpr1sebf was defined as the bayes factor a 3 b f p y 1 m p y n m 1 n p y t e s t m which is the likelihood ratio of training data with the most likely model m max p y n m n and a test ir y t e s t note that a b f larger than 1 indicate that training normal irs have a better fit to the model compared to test data and therefore indicate a fault the marginal likelihoods of training data were obtained by approximating the integration of kernel parameters θ a 4 p y n m p y n θ m p θ m d θ by a weighted sum of the contribution from the particle filter a 5 p ˆ y n m p 1 p w p p y n y m θ p the gpr1selr used a similar decision criterion but where the average likelihood value of training data was instead based on mle kernel parameter values the decision variable was then defined as the likelihood ratio l r between the average likelihood of training data and the average likelihood of test data given all mle models from training data a 6 l r p y 1 m 1 p y n m n 1 n p y t e s t m 1 p y

18480,biofilm formation causes bias in dissolved oxygen do sensors which hamper their usage for automatic control and thereby balancing energy and treatment efficiency we analysed if a dataset that was generated with deliberate perturbations can automatically be interpreted to detect bias caused by biofilm formation we used a challenging set up with realistic conditions that are required for a full scale application this included automated training adapting to changing normal conditions and automated tuning setting an alarm threshold to assure that the fault detection fd methods are accessible to the operators the results showed that automatic usage of fd methods is difficult especially in terms of automatic tuning of alarm thresholds when small training datasets only represent the normal conditions i e clean sensors despite the challenging set up two fd methods successfully improved the detection limit to 0 5 mg do l bias caused by biofilm formation we showed that the studied dataset could be interpreted equally well by simpler fd methods as by advanced machine learning algorithms this in turn indicates that the information contained in the actively generated data was more vital than its interpretation by advanced algorithms graphical abstract image 1 keywords active fault detection monitoring receiver operating characteristics gaussian process regression one class classification 1 introduction we studied how fault detection fd methods automatically can detect bias in dissolved oxygen do sensors caused by biofilm fouling we evaluate how a limited but from an operator perspective realistic amount of quality checked training data impacts the training and performance of fd methods we use the dataset in samuelsson et al 2018 that were generated in line with the concept active fault detection afd which is so far an unexplored concept for wastewater applications 1 1 the importance of verifying do sensor readings monitoring the condition of sensors and their related data quality in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs is essential especially when used for automatic control the do sensor is a key sensor to monitor for two reasons i a bias has a direct effect on aeration energy and or treatment efficiency and ii the usage of do sensors is widespread with multiple sensors in a standard wrrf the workload for do sensor maintenance is thus expected to make up a large proportion of the total sensor maintenance time 1 2 pushing state of the art for monitoring do sensors in samuelsson et al 2018 we studied biofilm formation fouling and its effect on the two common measurement types of do sensors namely membrane electrochemical mec and optical opt sensors the results showed that a bias above 1 0 mg l due to biofilm formation could be detected with a simple rise time estimation method rt for the opt sensor we concluded that other fd methods than rt needs to be evaluated to detect lower bias levels and biofilm fouling faster which is the purpose of this study in this study we aim to improve the detection limit to 0 5 mg l bias which we believe is satisfactory for an early warning system but still challenging in the light of previous results 1 3 informative data from active fault detection a novel part of the work in samuelsson et al 2018 was that the data from the do sensors were generated in line with the concept afd a concept recently reviewed by puncochár and skach 2018 the afd is centred around designing a test signal which is physically implemented operationalized to perturb the studied system in a controlled manner the purpose of the test signal is to increase the diagnostic information content in data without interfering with normal operation in samuelsson et al 2018 the test signal was a short impulse and implemented as pressurized air from the sensor s automatic air cleaning system the short impulse temporary increases the sensor s ambient do concentration and has been denoted an impulse response ir similar ideas as afd have been introduced including system identification ljung 1999 on line modelling vanrolleghem 1994 adaptive automatic control seborg et al 1986 and reinforcement learning buşoniu et al 2008 at the heart of these ideas lies experimental signal design to produce information that is optimal according to some criterion see fedorov 2010 for an overview of optimal experimental design oed the close relationship between oed system identification and adaptive automatic control has been reviewed in pronzato 2008 although fault detection applications were not considered the afd has been used to improve classical fault detection strategies i detection of changed model parameter nikoukhah and campbell 2008 ii diagnosis with multiple failure models campbell et al 2002 iii and residual generation padilla and choinière 2015 we expect that oed can be useful for further developing afd since optimality criteria have been described both for optimal parameter estimation that relate to i a d and e optimal fedorov 2010 and model discrimination t optimal atkinson and fedorov 1975 that relate to ii the merits of using oed would however be limited to optimizing models representing normal conditions as faulty data are infeasible to obtain in practice especially during an iterative oed procedure we believe that afd can be especially suitable for wrrf applications a dedicated test signal with high and controllable excitation should be able to produce data with large signal to noise ratio here noise refers to the normal daily seasonal and influent flow dependent variations that in general makes it hard to detect sensor anomalies during normal operation conducting automated test signals enables exact repeatability and precision which contrasts to manual checks performed by operators 1 4 automatic fault detection requires annotated training data fd methods valuable in practice both need to have good detection performance high detection rate low false alarm rate and to be practically feasible from an operator s perspective practically feasible means simple to use under existing conditions with little extra workload automated training adapting to training data and tuning setting the alarm threshold are therefore desirable however an automated training tuning procedure in turn requires timely access to accurately annotated training data here we refer to annotated data as data labelled either normal or faulty that represent the system s sensor state the degree of required annotation ranges from complete annotation both faulty and normal classes annotated to unannotated data depending on which fd method that is used so called supervised classification methods exploit annotated data from both classes in contrast to unsupervised methods that exploit data without annotation see e g bishop 2006 fd methods that only use data from one class only commonly from the normal mode are called one class classification methods pimentel et al 2014 in short the higher degree of annotation in training data the easier the fault detection task becomes since more information is available about the difference between a fault and the normal condition annotated data unfortunately are scarce in practice the reason for lack of faulty annotated data is clear faults should be rare but even when faults are present annotation is problematic it is difficult and time consuming to identify the starting time of e g a sensor fault there is seldom a clear cut transition between the normal and the faulty mode the definition of what is faulty is subjective and depends on the context also normal annotated data are challenging data considered to be normal during daily operations often contain unknown flaws which make them unrepresentative for the normal state and therefore also unsuitable for fd method training 1 5 challenges and our solutions the goal with our study is to improve the detection level to 0 5 mg l bias on do sensors for the data in samuelsson et al 2018 further we conduct our study with realistic constraints that are needed to be solved in a full scale implementation which include timely access to annotated training data automated tuning of alarm thresholds using a realistic amount of annotated normal data automated training to allow the fd methods to adapt to changing normal conditions such as worn sensor and or seasonal variations we address these challenges by labelling data from the 24 h period after manual sensor verification as being normal using small 24 h normal annotated data for fd method training only consider automated training and tuning procedures with minimal data pre processing and end user input decisions we assess how both supervised and unsupervised fd methods can be modified to analyse unconventional data with irs generated with afd note that only normal training data are considered further we combine the performance measure receiver operating characteristics roc see kay 1998 with a data transformation model in venkatasubramanian et al 2003 to get insights in the interplay between data and fd methods the majority studies considering afd have been theoretical simulation studies with few real world applications this study is one of few where real data are considered and to our knowledge the first one with a wrrf application this study therefore pushes the state of the art knowledge of the applicability of afd to real systems we finally stress that afd is a different approach compared to previous research in the field which has so far been driven by interpreting and combining existing data see e g the review by corominas et al 2018 2 materials and methods this section is structured as follows section 2 1 gives an overview of the datasets in samuelsson et al 2018 and section 2 2 describe how they were evaluated here in terms of training and test data section 2 3 explains introduce a data transformation model that was used to assess the performance of the fd methods the choice of fd methods is motivated in section 2 4 and a technical description of the fd methods can be found in appendix a 2 1 data an overview of the datasets used in this study is given in this section but details can be found in samuelsson et al 2018 an ir is here defined as a 60 s long data sequence with temporary elevated do values from a do sensor which has been subjected to a 20 s long impulse of pressurized air fig 1 a the 60 s ir time frame starts jointly with the air impulse the qualitative shape of an ir has been shown to be informative about the extent of biofilm fouling on the sensor fig 1b it is the task for the fd methods to differentiate between normal and fouled irs that cause a bias two datasets from samuelsson et al 2018 were used in this study one with artificial grease fouling denoted dart and one with real biofilm formation denoted dreal the dart was produced by recording irs at different locations in a conventional activated sludge process asp with varying degrees of manually applied grease film as an imitation of biofilm formation in total dart contain 50 normal and 2628 fouled irs the dreal was produced in a different wrrf than dart where real biofilm formation on sensors is problematic the dreal contains six experimental periods each one with a length between 10 and 62 days each experimental period started with a clean sensor and the extent of biofilm formation increased until the sensor was manually cleaned and the next experimental period begun in both datasets the bias at different levels of fouling was obtained as the difference between the measured do concentration in the fouled sensor before an ir and the value from a clean reference do sensor that measures close to the fouled sensor in dart only do sensors of mec type were fouled but in dreal both mec and opt sensors were fouled and evaluated 2 2 realistic and automated training procedure as mentioned in section 1 4 it is essential to develop practically feasible fd methods meaning that realistic constraints need to be tackled three such constraints are critical to automate the usage of fd methods i timely access to annotated normal data ii automatic training to adapt to changing normal conditions iii automatic tuning of alarm threshold note that we distinguish between training adapting the fd method to normal conditions and tuning setting the alarm threshold for a desired trade off between sensitivity and robustness in the following five sections we motivate why the constraints in our study are realistic and reflect solutions available for a full scale implementation the two datasets in this study were used for different purposes with different training and evaluation procedures which are described in section 2 2 4 2 2 5 note that all fd methods were given the exact same raw data and conditions for tuning training and evaluation minimal data pre processing was applied where only outliers less than 10 irs in total were initially removed the removed ir outliers contained partly frozen signals caused by data transfer problems 2 2 1 timely access to annotated normal training data we defined the 24 h after an approved manual sensor verification as normal data and argue that within 24 h it is reasonable to assume that no fouling or sensor wearing has occurred here a verification consisted of manual cleaning and compensation for potential bias due to drift after the last verification sensor verification was conducted in the beginning of each experimental period in dreal and for all normal irs in dart in full scale sensor maintenance information system date and time for manual cleaning and calibration are stored and provide the necessary information for sensor verification such data can automatically be transferred to a fd method as a realistic solution for providing the required normal annotated data the number of training irs was limited to 12 to only use realistic small training datasets the reason was that 24 h of normal annotated training data only contain 12 irs per sensor when the sensor supplier s recommendation of 2 hour cleaning interval is applied too frequent air cleaning wears the sensor out and would also reduce the time when the do sensor can be used for automatic control during the 2 3 min of air cleaning the do sensor is not sensing the true do concentration 2 2 2 automatic training to adapt to changing normal conditions it is important to have automatic procedures to compensate for non stationarity in wrrf process data seasonal variations and wear in sensor that may cause changes in its ir in this study and for a potential full scale application we assumed that the 12 irs 24 h after a sensor verification were accessible for automatic re training the fd methods in practice sensor verifications and re training are expected to occur in intervals of 2 4 weeks which is enough to adapt to seasonal variations in data and wearing in sensor 2 2 3 automatic alarm threshold tuning we used the off line approach described by gustafsson 2000 to set the alarm threshold for all fd methods the approach requires the user to specify a desired false alarm rate provide a normal dataset and an acceptable range for the alarm threshold thereafter an automated procedure is conducted where all alarm thresholds in the acceptable range are evaluated with respect to false alarm rates on the normal dataset the alarm threshold closest to the desired one is chosen for the on line application the implicit assumption for the approach is that the normal training dataset is representative for the full probability distribution of the normal mode this means that a training dataset with 12 irs is too small to use for tuning purposes we however expect that it is a realistic effort for an operator to produce a larger training dataset about 1 week s data once every year with the purpose of tuning the alarm threshold it is an open question whether each do sensor would need individual tuning or if the same dataset and tuning could be used for all sensors of equal types 2 2 4 dataset dreal training tuning and performance assessment the dreal was evaluated to imitate realistic and automated full scale usage of the assessed fd methods the first experimental period period 1 was used as off line normal data to tune the fd methods to a 10 false alarm rate the 10 threshold was chosen slightly higher than what is desired in a full scale application where 1 5 is more reasonable the purpose with a 10 alarm limit was to simplify the interpretation of the results e g it is not possible to evaluate whether a fd method that have much lower false alarm rates on test data than 1 for the experimental periods 2 5 the first 12 irs in each period where used for training as described in section 2 2 2 and the remaining irs for evaluation false alarm rate and detection rate were used as performance measures for the evaluation note that the 10 desired false alarm rate was the only part specified by the researchers all remaining training and tuning steps were conducted in an automated way without subjective interference 2 2 5 dataset dart training and performance assessment the dart was used to assess the performance of the fd methods with equal amount of training data as for dreal 12 irs but without tuning the alarm threshold instead the full range of possible alarm thresholds was evaluated for both false alarm and detection rates and visualized in a graph a graph where each point on the curve corresponds to a false alarm probability x axis and detection probability y axis for a specific alarm threshold is known as receiver operating characteristics roc see kay 1998 the roc enables an assessment of detection performances between fd methods with optimal alarm thresholds where only the interplay of training data and fd methods are assessed we use the term optimal alarm thresholds since the value for the alarm threshold can differ for different training and test datasets which is not applicable in practice the ranges of alarm threshold for all fd methods are provided in the supplementary materials in table 2 the roc curve can be evaluated in terms of a scalar measure by integrating for the area underneath the roc curve auc here we considered the partial area under curve p a u c α up to a false alarm ratio α the reason for only considering part of the auc area was that it is only fd methods with low false alarm rate that are relevant for practical implementations the actual evaluation was conducted by randomly selecting 12 training irs from the 50 normal irs the remaining 38 normal and 2628 faulty irs where used to compute results for the roc curve the evaluation was repeated four times with different training irs to get indications about how sensitive the results are based on the selection of training data 2 3 transforming data to diagnostic information as described by venkatasubramanian et al 2003 any diagnostic decision making process can be described by its underlying data transformation process see fig 2 traditional fd methods are designed to maximize the diagnostic information content from existing raw process data in afd the information content in raw data is increased by a priori knowledge of the system and diagnostic problem which is used to design an appropriate test signal further it is the subsequent combination of data transformation steps that decide the overall diagnostic performance of any fd method note that the information flow is in one direction from left to right in fig 2 thus lost information in one early data space cannot be recovered in subsequent steps this highlights why the afd has potential since it is the first step excitation space in the data transformation process in this study we used the data transformation process as a tool to separate different parts of a fd method and thereby allow increased insights into why some fd methods fail or not one relevant example concerns the alarm threshold class space and the roc curve feature space if good performance for a fd method is obtained in decision space but poor performance in class space this indicates that it is the tuning of the alarm threshold that fails the characteristics and separation of data spaces for all fd methods are described in table 1 in appendix a 2 4 fault detection methods in this section we motivate the choice of fd methods a detailed description of the evaluated fd methods is given in appendix a state of the art fd methods potentially give better detection performance at the risk of being more complicated compared to simple fd methods complicated fd methods are however more costly with regards to operator training method usage and tuning and on line integration implementation debugging and data storage thus a cost effective fd method is a trade off between complexity and detection performance we therefore compared four fd methods of varying degree of complexity namely the pragmatic engineering approach pea response time estimation rt principal component analysis pca and gaussian process regression gpr the pea was a straight forward usage of the descriptive statistics mean and standard deviation the rt have been described and evaluated in samuelsson et al 2018 and thus serves as baseline performance for the other fd methods the pca is the most cited fd method in wrrf applications corominas et al 2018 and one of few fd methods that has actually been implemented on line in wrrfs see wade et al 2005 the mathematics of pca are well known and have been described e g in the tutorial review by bro and smilde 2014 and specifically for wrrf applications in haimi 2016 thus pca is expected to be familiar to some wrrf operators and relevant as benchmarking method the most advanced fd method in this study was gpr which is a state of the art pattern recognition algorithm that has been widely spread in the machine learning community see rasmussen and williams 2005 and its citations the gpr has also been described and introduced to wrrf applications in samuelsson et al 2017 we expected gpr to be the best method since it is properties should make it ideal to model changes in the shape of an ir in addition gpr produce uncertainty intervals in its default from that are useful for automatically tuning alarm thresholds we expected that the ambient do concentration before an ir denoted initial do concentration should impact the height of the ir therefore we added the feature initial do concentration to all fd methods and thereby creating several variants of the four fd methods see appendix a for a detailed summary we were especially interested in evaluating different variants of gpr since it was the most advanced method that was also the least studied fd method for wrrf applications for the gpr the initial do concentration in combination with the ir was used to construct a two dimensional non linear regression model for the shapes of irs we expected that this should be a flexible and successful model that could differ any changes in the irs due to fouling from normal irs we compared two two dimensional gpr variants gpr2se and gpr2ard see appendix for details with two one dimensional variants gpr1sebf and gpr1selr the one dimensional variants had a different detection mechanism in terms of decision variables where the likelihood ratio between training irs and test irs was used as decision variable this is not the standard way to use gpr for fd and we were curious whether such measure could be better than the two dimensional variants we provide a detailed description of the gpr variants in appendix a 3 results and discussion the results for all fd methods on dreal and dart are jointly shown and discussed we focus on three key topics 1 detection performances of the fd methods in terms of detecting the desired 0 5 mg l bias section 3 1 3 3 3 4 and 3 7 and avoiding false alarms section 3 2 2 complications that are related to automatic tuning and training in section 3 2 1 3 2 2 3 5 and 3 6 3 transferability to a full scale applications and related aspects section 3 8 the results on dart fig 3 give an overview of the general performance ordering of all fd methods the detection performances on dreal are provided for the two sensor types opt and mec in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively detailed results such as tuning and detection performances for all methods and datasets are given in table 1 3 1 the best performing fd methods a bias larger than 0 5 mg l was successfully detected in dreal for the opt sensor with a low number of false alarms with the three simplest fd methods pea rt and rti fig 4 only gpr2se gave good results disregarding period 2 on the same data among the more advanced gpr and pca methods similarly the pea rt rti and gpr2se also performed well on dart fig 3 the mec sensor on dreal fig 5 only obtained a bias above 0 5 mg l for minor parts of period 2 and 5 and it was therefore mainly false alarm rates that could be evaluated we believe that it is interesting that the advanced methods were not superior to the basic methods we expected both pca and gpr to improve the interpretation of the irs compared to the basic rt that only use one point from the ir whereas pca and gpr analyse the full ir our initial assumption was that when only small training datasets are available it should become even more important with advanced fd methods that can squeeze out any available information the results here do not support our initial assumption and indicate that the added workload of using advanced fd methods is not motivated for this application 3 2 false alarm distribution on mec sensor data a general challenge with fd methods is to reduce false alarms and understand their source there are many potential explanations for the abundance of false alarms for the mec sensor data in fig 5 where the most obvious are influence from varying initial do concentration during test periods grey line fig 5 non representative tuning data resulting in a inappropriate alarm thresholds obtained during period 1 the tuning period we focused on understanding the source of false alarms for the best performing fd methods as reported in section 3 1 i e pea rt rti and gpr2se 3 2 1 impact of initial do concentration both rti and gpr2se had fewer false alarms in period 5 compared to period 4 despite a dramatic variation in the initial do concentration between 3 and 6 mg l period 5 see fig 5 this is the opposite of would be expected if the initial do concentration during test periods was the reason for the false alarms during day 38 in period 4 all four fd methods gave false alarms when the do concentration was abruptly increased these results indicate that sudden changes in the do concentration can produce false alarms although it was not the main reason for false alarms for rti and gpr2se our explanation is that both rti and gpr2se made use of the initial do concentration as a feature and could therefore avoid false alarms due to varying do concentrations this explanation is strengthened by the fact that rt and pea that did not use initial do concentration as a feature table 1 in appendix a and had more false alarms in period 5 3 2 2 interaction between tuning training data and alarm threshold values to study whether the training data were representative for normal conditions we compared the variation in the 12 training irs for all experimental periods period 2 5 the training data differed in initial do concentration see supplementary materials figs 1 5 and interestingly period 4 with most false alarms had the smallest spread in initial do concentration in its training dataset to test the influence of spread in initial do concentration in training data on false alarm rates we replaced three irs in the original training data with irs with either a smaller or larger spread in initial do concentration the spread was increased in period 4 and reduced in period 5 and we then repeated the evaluation see supplementary materials figs 6 and 7 if insufficient spread in training data was the underlying cause for the false alarm rates an increase in the spread for training data would reduce the false alarm rate and imply that larger variations in the irs in test data are accepted as normal the opposite argumentation applies for period 5 where we reduced the spread compared to the original training data the revaluated results showed that changing the spread in initial do concentration in training data had a clear effect on the false alarm rates see fig 8 in supplementary materials the gpr2se and rti dramatically decreased their false alarm rates in period 4 gpr2se from 29 to 8 and rti from 41 to 1 in period 5 the false alarm rates increased from 14 to 18 gpr2se and from 6 to 52 rti when the spread instead was decreased neither pea nor rt were affected by the spread in initial do concentrations in training data this was reasonable since neither of them used the initial do concentration explicitly in feature space and they should therefore not be affected by a changed spread in the initial do concentration we conclude that sufficient spread in initial do concentration in training data was necessary to reduce false alarms for both gpr2se and rti we hypothesize that sufficient should be put in relation to the ratio in variations between training and tuning data 3 3 the one dimensional gpr variants the one dimensional gpr variants gpr1sebf and gpr1selr had better performance than gpr2ard but worse than all other fd methods on dart fig 3 the results showed that the marginal likelihood was not a good feature to separate normal from fouled irs the separation between normal and faulty distributions in feature space sets an upper limit for the performance in the next data spaces decision and class space it was therefore not surprising that none of the one dimensional gpr variants gave good results on dreal figs 4 5 where also class space is included in addition they had non robust performance on dart and on the test periods similarly as the gpr2ard variant in the end the one dimensional gpr variants had worse performance than the simple rt and pea and were therefore not considered further 3 4 two dimensional gpr variants we previously noted that gpr2se had good detection performance but missed the faults in period 2 reconsider the opt sensor data in fig 4 similarly as on the opt sensor data gpr2se had one iteration with deviating poor results on dart also gpr2ard had varying performance although with poor results in general we repeated the evaluation for gpr2se and gpr2ard 10 times on the opt sensor data which showed that their performance varied supplementary materials fig 9 since it was only the fd method training albeit the same training data that differed between the 10 iterations we conclude that the varying performance for both gpr2se and gpr2ard was an effect of the stochastic properties in the method this was surprising since the particle filter variant of gpr has been shown to produce robust results see samuelsson et al 2017 note that the only difference between gpr2ard and gpr2se was that the ard kernel allowed separate parameter values for both dimensions in contrast to the se kernel which used equal parameter values for both dimensions see appendix a for the technical description of gpr the additional flexibility in the ard kernel was clearly a drawback and decreased the gpr2 s performance from good gpr2se to worse than what would have been obtained by chance compare gpr2ard with ctd in fig 3 3 5 the tunability problem in this section we define the tunability problem as when the desired false alarm rate is not reached for a fd method on a given dataset regardless of alarm threshold value that is used the automatic off line tuning procedure described in section 2 2 relied upon obtaining a user specified false alarm rate to tune the fd methods the results however showed that this was not applicable for all fd methods an example of the tunability problem was for rt and rti which were tuned to 2 false alarm rate in contrast to the desired 10 compare false alarm rates in p1 first row in table 1 the reason for rt and rti not to be tuned at 0 1 was because it was not possible to separate 10 of the normal irs in the tuning dataset in period 1 while iterating within the given range of alarm threshold values i e the rise time limit the tunability problem was present in other fd methods as well gpr1sebf and gp2ard in the opt sensor data and also in the mec sensor data rt gpr2se gpr2ard if considering a 5 percent unit deviation from desired false alarm rate as acceptable for the rt the reason was a too low sampling time of 1 s which in practice round off all rise time values to full seconds that in turn made it difficult to separate small differences in irs to conclude it was the insufficient separation of normal training data in feature space that was the cause for the undesired tuning and not poorly chosen threshold values in class space we expect the tunability problem to increase if lower false alarm rates such as 1 are required also if 1 alarm rate is desired with one detected ir the minimal number tuning dataset would be 100 irs 8 days from the results it seems like the tuning dataset also need to contain irs spread out in the assumed normal distribution we don t necessary refer to a gaussian distribution we conclude that the suggested approach for tuning is inappropriate for this application and likely also similar applications with small tuning datasets 3 6 inconsistent detection performance disregarding the tunability problem and that not all fd methods obtained 0 1 false alarm rate it is still desirable that they at least obtain similar false alarm rates during the test periods period 2 5 as during the tuning period period 1 such behaviour indicates predictable false alarm rates based on the tuning and provides confidence that data transformation from measurement space to class space is consistent with different data however none of the nine fd methods produced consistent results with regards to both false alarms and detection rates at all test periods table 1 a subjective assessment should also be made by studying the location of false alarms and detection rates with respect to their proximity of fault and normal periods we would get more confident in fd methods producing early detections close to the fault period compared to randomly spread out false alarms based on such subjective assessment we can see that only pea rt and rti in the opt sensor data fig 4 gave reasonable results and none of the fd methods gave convincing results for all test periods in the mec sensor data fig 5 the inconsistent performance would be a major drawback in a full scale application since it is critical that the operators gain trust in the fd method at hand to use it potentially the consistency could be improved with more representative training data as discussed in section 3 2 2 the fact that all studied fd methods gave inconsistent performance supports the indication that the problem is related to training data rather than the fd methods 3 7 the pca variants the two pca variants were the best performing fd methods on dart and had close to optimal pauc0 1 performance table 1 and fig 3 but gave poor results too many false alarms on dreal figs 4 5 the reason for the discrepancy was unsatisfactory tuning of alarm threshold values here the unsatisfactory tuning refers to too tight threshold value with respect to the non faulty training data resulting in many false alarms in dreal the discrepancy can be understood by first reconsidering the near optimal performance in dart the key to this result was that the threshold value was varied to obtain all possible detection performances combinations of false alarm and detection ratios and not fixed as in dreal the roc evaluation thus provides a measure of separation between normal and faulty distributions for a given combination av data transformation steps an additional indication that pca produced good mode probability distribution separation was that neither of the pca variants suffered from the tunability problem and achieved the desired false alarm rates within 5 percent units in all datasets this was however obtained with the cost of also changing the threshold values between the iterations in dart table 1 especially the first iteration had deviating threshold values in several orders of magnitude compared to the other iterations one ir with a different shape was present in the training data in the first iteration see supplementary materials fig 10 and was assumed to be the reason for the deviating threshold values in addition the varying threshold values were non intuitive with values in the range of 1e 3 to 1e 13 and far from the commonly used 0 95 confidence level to conclude the results in this study indicate that pca successfully separated the faulty and normal data distributions although it was not possible in practice to use a fixed alarm threshold for different training and test datasets the pca needs to be further studied on how to tune and set alarm threshold values in relation to training data 3 8 topics for do sensor monitoring on a full scale which fd method had sufficiently convincing results and are there problems that need to be solved to put the fd methods in production on a full scale it was clear that the automatic tuning procedure needs to be improved and that the false alarm rates need to be suppressed which are key problems to handle in a full scale application we suggest three solutions to reduce the problems with false alarms i require a certain number of consecutive alarms before an alarm is raised this would remove random alarms at the cost of a delayed detection ii two or more fd methods are combined in an ensemble monitoring system to increase the robustness towards false alarms iii the test signal should be improved to take into account that training and tuning data are produced so that a wide range of initial do concentrations are include in the training data if possible despite the manufacturer s recommendation the size of training datasets should be increased from the results it is clear that achieving automatic tuning of fd methods with small training and tuning datasets is difficult as mentioned in section 3 2 2 an increased focus on producing training datasets with larger spread in initial do concentration could improve the training procedure and probably also the tuning procedure we therefore believe that it is more important to improve the test signal and the information content in the irs rather than developing better fd methods unfortunately a more advanced design procedure for obtaining annotated training and tuning data is unrealistic for a full scale application since more time and efforts are required more research on strategies for automatic tuning with small normal annotated datasets is needed future studies should also compare how a human expert can interpret the ir s in comparison to the best fd method such comparison would serve as a sanity check for how good detection performance that at least can be obtained from the data that is if a human expert outperforms the best fd method there is room for improving the fd method recent research has demonstrated that algorithms can produce better detection performance than human experts see e g haenssle et al 2018 and it would be interesting to study whether similar results could be obtained for the given data in this study as well the costs and benefits of using the fd methods need to be put into relation to the time for the cost of simply increasing the manual sensor maintenance interval we expect the cost for a false alarm in terms of too early sensor cleaning to be small compared to a using a do sensor with 0 5 mg l bias for aeration control the cost in terms of lost confidence from the operators due to false alarms is however expected to be high even if the human operator can make a good visual control about the biofilm formation on a sensor we believe that automated fd methods still are valuable tools as an example consider a fd method that provide reliable information about the sensor condition and likewise its data quality such information can be of great use to prioritize which sensor to check and maintain when time is scarce further automated generation of data quality indices for many sensors can also provide quantifiable information about e g which lines or zones that are more suspect to fouling which in turn can be used to improve a fixed sensor maintenance schedule automatic and objective storage of the condition for many sensors is time consuming and a task that is better suited for automated fd methods rather than for human operators 4 conclusions active fault detection can provide timely information about biofilm formation on do sensors and it is a promising concept to improve sensor maintenance two fd methods rti and gpr2se reached the goal to improve the detection limit to 0 5 mg l bias caused by biofilm fouling the detection performance was more related to how good the training data represented the normal variations rather than how advanced the fd method was further the study illustrated that it is difficult to conduct automatic fault detection especially to tune the alarm threshold when only small normal training datasets are available more research is needed to solve how training data can be made representative for the normal conditions and included in the active fault detection

should be intuitive to understand and straight forward to implement the pea first normalizes the training irs by subtracting their respective initial do concentration then the mean ir m e a n and standard deviation values ir s d at each time point are calculated to define the normal behaviour of an ir the final step before running the algorithm on test data ir t e s t is to decide the number of standard deviation values by tuning the threshold value β that defines the detection limit the relation between these steps and the data spaces is given in table 1 rise time estimation rt the rt computes the time for an ir to reach 63 percent of its peak value see details in andersson and hallgren 2015 samuelsson et al 2018 in this study we include an additional variant rti that also made use of the initial do concentration d o i of training and test irs to compensate for a potential effect from different initial do concentrations the rti used the least squares linear regression of the correlation between initial do concentration and time constant values for the 12 training irs the decision limits were then based on the prediction intervals from the least squares estimate according to a 1 r t i d o i l i m r t i d o i γ i s s r t i 1 1 12 d o i d o i 2 s s d o i where the detection limits depend on the initial do concentration of a test ir the rt i do i is the mean predicted rise time based on the initial do concentration of a test ir do i and the γ i is a threshold value to be tuned the term after γ i is the standard error of prediction which contain the mean squared error for the regression residuals s s r t i and the mean squared sum of the training initial do concentrations s s d o i principal component analysis pca in short pca extracts key linear correlations from the sample covariance matrix of correlated variables deviations from the normal covariance structure are used as indication for a fault in this study pca was applied to the irs where each time step from an ir 1 60 s was treated as an individual variable the data were standardized to zero mean and standard deviation one two principal components were used as they contained at least 95 of the variation during a 10 fold cross validation based on training data from period 1 in dreal two pca variants with different decision spaces were considered the standard variant pcastand used the common hotelling s t2 index and squared prediction error spe as decision variables whereas the second variant pcacomb combined t2 and spe to one decision variable denoted φ as in yue and qin 2001 the pcastand was implemented with threshold value with χ 2 distribution for the critical t2 limit and the robust spe limit from varmuza and filzmoser 2009 the threshold value for φ was based on ϝ distribution for the t2 limit and χ 2 distribution for the spe which gave less restrictive limits compared to the pcastand the confidence level α was used as tunable alarm threshold value for both pca variants see table 1 gaussian process regression gpr the gpr has been detailed in e g rasmussen and williams 2005 and represents the state of the art fd method in this study and is therefore the least studied algorithm applied to wrrf applications and afd data it is hence of interest to understand how variants of gpr can be applied to afd data and impact its performance in short gpr can be described as a non linear regression method that performs a smooth interpolation of training data the gpr also produces a data dependent prediction interval were both the mean prediction and the prediction interval are based on the assumption that data can be described as a gaussian process i e a multivariate normal distribution the gpr was modified to four variants that differed in both feature and decision space table 1 the first two variants gpr1sebf and gpr1selr only made use of the irs as feature one dimension whereas the remaining two gpr2se and gpr2ard also included the initial do concentration as a second feature variable two dimensional indicated with a lowercase 2 the difference between the latter two variants was two different kernels the standard squared exponential se and the automatic relevance detection kernel ard the difference is that the ard have separate kernel parameter for every dimension in contrast to the se kernel that uses the same length and variance parameters for all dimensions note that since both the se and the ard have same kernel construction the gpr1se would be identical to gpr1ard the kernel is an important design choice in gpr and can be described as a parametrized covariance matrix see bishop 2006 for an introduction to kernels a critical step in training gpr is to infer the kernel parameters from data the most common approach relies on maximum likelihood estimation mle rasmussen and williams 2005 various bayesian approaches also exist that make probabilistic approximations of the kernel parameter distributions e g by using particle filters in this study we used both approaches where the mle approach from rasmussen and nickisch 2010 was used in gpr1selr and the particle filter implementation gpr smc in svensson et al 2015 was used in gpr2se gpr2ard and gpr1sebf to allow a fair comparison the mle approach was repeated equally many times as the number of particles in the bayesian approach also the gpr smc was modified to add a small probability value of 1 0e 14 to zero probabilities in the in uniform distribution during kernel parameter sampling to avoid numerical problems the settings for the gpr variants are provided in the supplementary materials in table 1 the difference between gpr1selr and gpr1sebf was in the decision space which also differed from the two dimensional variants for the two dimensional variants the standard gpr approach was applied which make use of the prediction intervals i e the mean prediction g p m e a n and the standard deviation g p s d of the predictive normal distribution as decision limits table 1 the width of the prediction interval alarm threshold value was tuned by deciding the number of standard deviations δ in the prediction interval for the one dimensional variants it was not straight forward how to infer the kernel parameters especially since all training data had equivalent time values t 1 60 here we assumed that training data 12 irs were independent realizations from one underlying gaussian process a 2 p y 1 y n m p y 1 m p y n m where p y 1 y n m is the joint probability of datasets 1 to n given a gpr model m the decision variable for gpr1sebf was defined as the bayes factor a 3 b f p y 1 m p y n m 1 n p y t e s t m which is the likelihood ratio of training data with the most likely model m max p y n m n and a test ir y t e s t note that a b f larger than 1 indicate that training normal irs have a better fit to the model compared to test data and therefore indicate a fault the marginal likelihoods of training data were obtained by approximating the integration of kernel parameters θ a 4 p y n m p y n θ m p θ m d θ by a weighted sum of the contribution from the particle filter a 5 p ˆ y n m p 1 p w p p y n y m θ p the gpr1selr used a similar decision criterion but where the average likelihood value of training data was instead based on mle kernel parameter values the decision variable was then defined as the likelihood ratio l r between the average likelihood of training data and the average likelihood of test data given all mle models from training data a 6 l r p y 1 m 1 p y n m n 1 n p y t e s t m 1 p y

18481,methane fluxes from aqueous sediments strongly influence global atmospheric methane however many questions still puzzle researchers for example why are some unstable sediments atmospheric methane sinks in this study a biofilm model originally developed for wastewater treatment was modified to simulate the microbial kinetics and substance conversions in aqueous surface sediments the model was validated by the experimental data and could predict chemical profiles and microbial distributions in sediments the model revealed complicated interactions between different microbial communities and environmental factors including competition between aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidizing bacteria and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria the results of model simulations showed that the effects of environmental factors especially dissolved oxygen and ammonia in overlying water on methane fluxes are very complicated rapid environmental changes which can be caused by tide day night alternation or zoobenthic and human activity and intensive competition between microbes greatly affected methane fluxes and resulted in alternation between atmospheric methane source and sink in unstable sediments this study extends the application of a wastewater treatment model to ecological studies of microbial interactions in natural sediments and explains some problems that might be difficult to resolve by using experimental methods graphical abstract image 1 keywords atmospheric methane sink nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation environmental factors interspecies competition mathematical modeling 1 introduction methane is a trace gas in the atmosphere but contributes to approximately 20 of the global greenhouse effect due to its high greenhouse warming potential a dramatic increase in atmospheric methane has been observed over the past hundred years from 880 ppb in 1900 etheridge et al 1998 to 1840 ppb currently nisbet et al 2016 pratscher et al 2018 thompson et al 2018 increasing concerns about global methane transport and transformation aquatic sediments are regarded as a critical source of atmospheric methane and sedimentary methane is emitted to the atmosphere through ebullition and diffusion maeck et al 2013 this sedimentary methane is originally produced by methanogenic archaea from anaerobic degradation of organic carbon most of it can usually be oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria or archaea in the sediment before emission conrad 2009 he et al 2018b shen et al 2019b biological processes are greatly dependent on environmental conditions and methane emission from sediment likely is sensitive to environmental changes especially in shallow waters some sediments were recently shown to be weak atmospheric methane sinks in unstable aquatic environments for example coastal sediments where environmental conditions change frequently due to periodic tides day night alternation and zoobenthic and human activity he et al 2019 olsson et al 2015 sun et al 2013 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2014 however the causes of these weak methane sinks are still not clear methane oxidation in sediment was once believed to be driven by archaeal anaerobic oxidation of methane aom in marine systems and by bacterial aerobic methane oxidation aerobic mo in freshwater environments studies in the past decades have demonstrated that aom processes including nitrite nitrate sulfate and metal dependent aoms also occur in freshwater and coastal sediments cai et al 2018 he et al 2018b hu et al 2014 norði and thamdrup 2014 segarra et al 2015 wang et al 2019 nitrite aom is performed by a unique bacterial taxon in nc10 phylum that produces intracellular dioxygen from nitrite and oxidizes methane through a traditional aerobic pathway ettwig et al 2010 he et al 2018a an aerobic enzyme particulate methane monooxygenase pmmo is used by nc10 methane oxidizers for methane activation wu et al 2012 possibly due to the wide distribution of methane and nitrite nc10 methane oxidizers seem to be ubiquitous in aquatic environments chen et al 2015a guerrero cruz et al 2019 shen et al 2016 zhu et al 2015 their ecological niche is thought to be near the oxic anoxic interface and some studies suggest that they thrive in sediments where nitrite and methane profiles overlap deutzmann et al 2014 he et al 2019 nitrate aom is carried out by archaeal lineage anme 2d haroon et al 2013 in environments like paddy soils and freshwater sediments ding et al 2014 shen et al 2017 shi et al 2013 vaksmaa et al 2016 aerobic methane oxidation occurs where oxygen and methane profiles overlap i e the oxic anoxic interface because of the close spatial proximity of the ecological niches of mob and nc10 methane oxidizers deutzmann et al 2014 intense competition for methane may exist between them however the prevalence of this competition and its impact on methane fluxes are unknown to date although they may be important for global methane cycle in this study based on the similarities between sediment and biofilm with respect to microbial distributions and chemical profiles a sediment model was developed by modifying the traditional biofilm model this model was then used to predict microbial abundance and methane emission rates under stable and unstable environmental conditions this modeling approach revealed interactions between different microbial communities and environmental factors as well as the alternation of atmospheric methane sources and sinks in unstable sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development based on the similarities between aqueous sediment and biofilm matrixes for example their chemical profiles and microbial distributions a biofilm model originally developed for wastewater treatment was modified to simulate the mass transfer and microbial conversion in aqueous surface sediments defined as the top 5 cm layer the surface sediments are regarded as the system in this model the overlying water and the deep sediments the environment influence the boundary conditions of the surface sediments fig 1 the similar distributions of substances and microbes in aqueous surface sediments and oxygen based membrane biofilm are shown in fig 1 the oxygen based membrane biofilm was designed to treat anaerobic effluent containing dissolved methane ammonia and organic matter as previously described chen et al 2015b reducible substances including methane ammonia and organic matter are provided on one side of biofilm sediment the lower boundary in fig 1 anaerobic effluent deep sediments whereas the oxidizer oxygen is supplied on the other side the upper boundary in fig 1 hollow fiber membrane overlying water resulting in similar chemical profiles and microbial distributions in the surface sediments eight types of microbes including ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anammox anaob aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria mob nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidizing bacteria nitrite damo nc10 nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea nitrate damo anme 2d and heterotrophic bacteria hb and 19 microbial processes listed in table s1 were considered we previously observed partial denitrification microbial reduction of nitrate into nitrite in sediments he et al 2019 and represented it in this model by introducing a new coefficient of partial denitrification fraction f pdn see fig s1 the partial denitrification fraction is defined as a ratio of nitrite production to nitrate reduction g n g n its value was calculated to be 0 321 based on the best fit of the experimental data see fig s2 six soluble species and ten solid species are involved in this model see table s2 the soluble species include dissolved methane s ch4 ammonia s nh4 organic matter om s s oxygen s o2 nitrate s no3 and nitrite s no2 the solid species are active biomass of aob x aob aoa x aoa nob x nob anaob x ana mob x mob nc10 bacteria x nc10 anme 2d archaea x anme and heterotrophic bacteria x h in addition to decomposition substance x s and inter biomass x i 2 2 model implementation the aqueous surface sediments were modeled in the program aquasim 2 1 reichert 1998 as presented in fig s3 a completely mixed compartment overlying water compartment and a biofilm compartment sediment compartment were developed to simulate the overlying water and sediments respectively these two compartments were connected with a diffusive link which models the mass transfer between overlying water and sediments a virtual high liquid flow 100 m3 d was designed in the biofilm compartment to keep the substance steady at the lower boundary of the surface sediments whereas a relatively low liquid flow 1 m3 d was adopted in the overlying water compartment to improve the calculation precision of methane efflux from sediments to overlying water through the upper boundary of the surface sediments these virtual flows are mathematic means to keep the boundary conditions steady or improve the precision of numerical calculation they do not represent real liquid flows methane efflux from sediment was calculated by the following function s ch4 out s ch4 in hrt v a where s ch4 in and s ch4 out are dissolved methane concentrations in influent and effluent of the overlying water compartments respectively hrt is hydraulic retention time of the compartment volume flow v is the volume of the overlying water compartment and a is the sediment surface area in contact with overlying water the stoichiometric matrix between microbial processes and variables is given in table s2 the stoichiometric coefficients of nitrate and nitrite of process 17 growth of hb using nitrate were modified because partial denitrification was considered in this model the values of stoichiometric coefficients kinetic parameters and diffusion coefficients involved in the model were obtained from previous literature and presented in tables s3 s4 and s5 respectively the substrate concentrations in overlying water and deep sediments at 5 cm depth were adopted from our previous experiments see table s6 he et al 2019 and used as default options in the model simulations unless otherwise specified seven types of simulation scenarios were used as described in table 1 2 3 correlation assumption interactions among microbes and environmental conditions are receiving increasing attention because they greatly influence methane flux in sediments thus the correlations among them were assumed in this work based on principles such as microbial substrate dependence microbial growth is often determined by limiting substrates see table s1 for the kinetic rate expressions of microbial growth competition is possible between microbial groups with a common substrate for example mob and nc10 bacteria compete for the common substrate of methane conversely a cooperative relationship may develop when the product of one microbe is the substrate of another microbe for example the cooperation between aob and nob fig 1 direct relationships between microbes and environmental factors are assumed that substrates stimulate microbial growth positive correlation or inhibitors reduce their growth negative correlation we summarize relationships in fig 2 and the interaction network is considerably complicated because some indirect influences are involved for example sediment methane can directly stimulate mob as a substrate but it also indirectly restricts the growth of mob through its effect on nc10 bacteria sediment methane greatly stimulates nc10 bacterial growth a high level of nc10 lowers surface methane concentration limiting mob growth similarly overlying water methane may inhibit nc10 bacteria by stimulating mob growth 3 results and discussion 3 1 model simulation and validation the model was applied to predict the microbial kinetics involved in carbon and nitrogen cycles in the aquatic surface sediments and the simulation results were validated by experimental data the partial denitrification fraction f pdn was estimated to be 0 321 according to the time course concentrations of nitrate and nitrite from a batch test of sediments amended with nitrate fig s2 the concentrations of dissolved oxygen do nitrate nitrite ammonia organic matter om and methane in overlying water and deep sediments at 5 cm depth were served as two boundary conditions the upper and lower boundaries of the modeled surface sediments and their values were obtained from our previous measurements table s6 he et al 2019 the simulation results of chemical and microbial profiles in the surface sediments scenario i in table 1 as well as the experimental data are shown in fig 3 the results indicated that all of the chemical profiles methane oxygen nitrate and nitrite could be predicted by the model fig 3a combining the diffusion equation of fick s law and mass balance conditions substrate consumption is directly proportional to the second derivative of the chemical profile a bend in the profile curve li and katsev 2014 the modeled methane profile was bended at the depth of 0 4 2 4 cm and close to be linear in depths of 0 0 4 and 2 4 5 0 cm indicating that methane was mostly consumed between 0 4 and 2 4 cm this finding was consistent with the experimental measurements of methane consumption from sliced sediments in which methane was mostly consumed in the depth of 0 5 2 0 cm he et al 2019 similarly the oxygen and nitrate nitrite profiles showed that oxygen and nitrate nitrite were consumed in the top 1 cm and 4 cm sediments respectively the penetration depths of oxygen and nitrate nitrite were therefore about 1 and 4 cm respectively in accord with many previous observations deutzmann et al 2014 neumann et al 2017 norði and thamdrup 2014 under the simulated conditions mob were in the top 1 cm of sediment nc10 bacteria were dominant in sediments of 0 4 2 4 cm in depth and anme 2d archaea were negligible in the top 5 cm of sediments fig 3b the community distribution from the simulation was in line with the experimental findings although the absolute values were different the distributions of mob and nc10 bacteria could be explained by the different penetration depths of oxygen and nitrate nitrite discussed above the very low abundance of anme 2d archaea not detected in many sediments in our previous experiments could be attributed to their poor affinity of methane he et al 2019 lu et al 2019 the microbial profiles of aoa aob nob and anaob indicated that aoa and nob were in the top 1 cm of sediments anaob were at a depth of 0 2 2 0 cm and aob were negligible under the simulated conditions fig 3c 3 2 important role of nc10 bacteria in sediment methane flux experimental results have indicated that nc10 bacteria were the largest methane sink in sediments of 0 5 2 0 cm depth he et al 2019 we wondered whether methane efflux would increase if nc10 bacteria were absent in these sediments this question is difficult to answer with current experimental approaches because the role of nc10 bacteria cannot to our knowledge be separately excluded acetylene a pmmo inhibitor is known to inhibit the activity of nc10 bacteria but it also inhibits mob ettwig et al 2010 he et al 2019 padilla et al 2016 therefore addition of acetylene would simultaneously inhibit mob and nc10 bacteria however nc10 bacteria can be easily excluded using the model approach to predict methane efflux in the absence of nc10 bacteria the microbial processes growth and decay of nc10 bacteria see table s1 were set to be inactive in the simulations see scenarios ii and iii in table 1 fig 4 a shows the simulation results of methane emission with and without nc10 bacteria under different do concentrations fixed do value in each simulation in overlying water the methane emission curves almost overlap except in the do range of 2 75 5 0 mg l this implies that the role of nc10 bacteria could be replaced by mob except at do values of 2 75 5 0 mg l microbial abundance with and without nc10 bacteria was calculated with overlying water do of 2 4 and 8 mg l figs s4 and s5 decreasing do from 8 to 4 mg l largely reduced the abundance of mob possibly causing the high methane emission in the do range of 2 75 5 0 mg l the competition between mob and aoa for oxygen might be one cause of mob reduction as shown previously alam and jia 2012 daebeler et al 2014 the abundance of nc10 bacteria was also limited but still contributed to methane consumption in the do range of 2 75 5 0 mg l resulting in relatively low methane emissions methane emission with and without nc10 bacteria under daily changing do conditions is shown in fig 4b scenario iii in table 1 methane emission changed daily with the variation in overlying water do in simulations with and without nc10 bacteria methane emissions increased rapidly when do decreased from 8 to 2 mg l and quickly decreased to low levels when do returned to 8 mg l remarkably the fluctuation of methane emission was smaller in the simulation with nc10 bacteria than that without nc10 bacteria and the average rate of methane emission was also lower in the former 2 14 vs 2 46 μmol m2 d this clearly indicates the important role of nc10 bacteria in methane emission reduction under changing environments previous works demonstrated that nc10 bacteria were the major methane sink of sediments in some stable environments deutzmann et al 2014 graf et al 2018 the findings above suggest the prediction that nc10 bacteria might be more important in unstable environments in which their roles could not be substituted by mob 3 3 substrate competition between mob and nc10 bacteria because the ecological niches of mob and nc10 bacteria are spatially adjacent and partially overlap competitive interactions between these species for methane substrate have been proposed he et al 2019 coexistence of mob and nc10 bacteria in sediments has been observed in natural environments such as lake sediments kojima et al 2012 liu et al 2015 moreover in previous ecological investigations methane consumption by nc10 bacteria could have been easily mistakenly attributed to mob due to their proximity and niche overlap in aquatic sediments deutzmann et al 2014 in this work the potential competition for methane between mob and nc10 bacteria was assessed by modeling the microbial profiles of mob with and without nc10 bacteria and the profiles of nc10 bacteria with and without mob scenario i in table 1 fig 5 a comparison of mob profiles with and without nc10 bacteria revealed that mob at depth of 0 4 1 1 cm were largely restricted in the presence of nc10 bacteria while mob at 0 0 4 cm were not significantly influenced by nc10 bacteria fig 5a similarly nc10 bacteria at depth of 0 1 1 4 cm were inhibited by mob while nc10 bacteria in the deeper sediments were only slightly affected by mob intensive competition between mob and nc10 bacteria occurs in the hypoxia zone depth of 0 4 1 1 cm under the simulated conditions do 0 but 1 0 mg l where mob and nc10 bacteria coexist since oxygen and nitrate nitrite are ubiquitous we predict that methane competition between mob and nc10 bacteria occurs frequently in hypoxia zones for instance nc10 bacteria and their activity were detected in marine oxygen minimum zones off northern mexico and costa rica padilla et al 2016 so methane competition between mob and nc10 bacteria might also occur in such environments methane profiles were distinguishably different between the three simulations above fig 5b the presence of nc10 bacteria resulted in a lower level of methane in the deep sediments 0 7 cm whereas the presence of mob lowered the surface 0 4 cm methane concentrations to trace levels greatly reducing methane emission into the atmosphere moreover the interactions between mob and nc10 bacteria were influenced by other taxa like anaob the profiles of mob and nc10 bacteria with and without anaob in the sediments are shown in fig s6 nc10 bacteria would be much more abundant and the niche would be deeper in the absence of anaob but mob would be outcompeted by a large number of nc10 bacteria due to the low concentrations of the key competing substrate nitrite and the overlap of niches 0 2 2 0 cm see fig 3b and c intensive competitive interactions between anaob and nc10 bacteria could be expected in many aquatic sediments the competitive interactions between anaob and nc10 bacteria have been observed in enrichment cultures fu et al 2017 hu et al 2015 luesken et al 2011 and co occurrence of anaob and nc10 bacteria has been discovered in various natural settings chen and gu 2017 shen et al 2019a xu et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 the indirect effects of non methane oxidizers like aoa and anaob on the methane cycle are also an interesting topic in complex natural environments 3 4 effects of environmental factors on sediment methane flux the effects of sediment environmental factors including dissolved methane organic matter and ammonia on the abundance of methane oxidizers and sediment methane emission were investigated fig 6 increasing sediment methane greatly raised the abundance of nc10 bacteria but only slightly increased the abundance of mob this might be because sediment methane was diffused from the deep sediments to the surface and nc10 bacteria at relatively deep sediments have an advantage over the uppermost mob he et al 2019 sediment methane seemed to be a critical factor stimulating nc10 bacteria this is supported by previous findings of high abundance of nc10 bacteria in soil sediment zones containing high concentrations of methane hu et al 2014 shen et al 2019b methane emission did not increase with an increase in sediment methane remaining restricted to a low level of 6 25 nmol m2 d this demonstrates the ability of methane oxidizers to reduce methane emission from sediments in stable environments sediment ammonia was found to inhibit nc10 bacteria and simulate mob and sediment methane emission increased exponentially in the tested range of sediment ammonia fig 6b the decrease in nc10 bacteria could be explained by the competition for nitrite with anaob as described above sediment ammonia encouraged the growth of anaob and then depleted nitrite resulting in the decline of the nc10 population the complicated effects of sediment organic matter on the abundance of methane oxidizers and the rate of methane emission are shown in fig 6c organic matter in upper sediments consumes oxygen nitrate and nitrite possibly limiting the growth of mob and nc10 bacteria overall as expected sediment organic matter increased methane emission however in the low concentrations of 0 7 mg cod l sediment organic matter greatly stimulated growth of nc10 bacteria and reduced methane emission as the penetration of nitrate is generally much deeper than that of oxygen in sediments deutzmann et al 2014 he et al 2019 norði and thamdrup 2014 the sediment nitrite below the oxic zone might be mostly derived from nitrate reduction by partial denitrification the deficiency of sediment organic matter restricted the activity of partial denitrification lowered the generation of nitrite and thereby limited the growth of nc10 bacteria this pathway of nitrite supply to nc10 bacteria was also examined by previous researchers and significant correlations between nc10 bacteria and organic matter were observed in some sediments shen et al 2015 the effects of dissolved methane organic matter ammonia nitrate nitrite and oxygen in overlying water on the abundance of mob and nc10 bacteria and the rate of methane emission are shown in fig 7 as expected dissolved methane in the overlying water stimulated the growth of mob and the sediments could take in methane from overlying water if the methane concentration exceeded 2 4 nm note that solubility of atmospheric methane is approximately 2 3 nm fig 7a oscillation of nc10 bacteria was observed this might be because overlying water methane stimulated nc10 bacterial growth by providing methane but inhibited it through intensifying competition with mob obviously the available methane in subsurface sediments for nc10 bacteria would decrease when mob is abundant nc10 bacterial growth was inhibited stimulated and almost completely inhibited by overlying water ammonia of 0 5 2 0 2 0 3 5 and 4 0 mg n l respectively fig 7b overlying water ammonia simultaneously stimulated and inhibited nc10 bacteria with complicated results overlying water ammonia could stimulate nc10 bacteria through increasing nitrite production by aoa aob but suppress them via increasing nitrite consumption by anaob see fig 2 indeed both the positive and negative correlations between ammonia and nc10 bacteria have been observed in the ecological studies chen and gu 2017 long et al 2017 it was expected that increasing nitrate nitrite stimulated the growth of nc10 bacteria fig 7c and d notably nitrate concentration from 0 to 1 0 mg n l dramatically mitigated methane emission in the presence of nitrate in sediments reducing substrates like organic matter and ammonia can be consumed by microbes this increases oxygen penetration which is favorable to mob and methane emission reduction nitrite slightly increased methane emission from sediments which might be explained by the decrease in mob that have a high affinity for low levels of methane cai et al 2016 pratscher et al 2018 organic matter in overlying water increased methane emission and decreased nc10 bacteria fig 7e the reason for the decline in nc10 bacteria might be that nitrite was depleted by excess organic matter zhu et al 2018 as shown in fig 7f the effects of overlying water do on mob and nc10 bacteria were complex and frequently fluctuated there was a negative correlation between mob abundance and methane emission when do was 5 mg l large increases in mob were always followed by great reductions of methane emission for example under conditions like do ranges of 0 2 and 4 5 mg l a competitive relationship between mob and nc10 bacteria was clearly seen with increases in nc10 bacteria always followed by a decrease in mob and vice versa fig 7f such competition was very intense and a slight increase in do might change microbial abundance and greatly influence methane emission only when the overlying water do was above 6 5 mg l suitable microbial community structures of mob and nc10 bacteria were formed to reduce methane emission under low levels 0 05 μmol m2 d in summary the key factor controlling nc10 bacteria might be nitrite nitrite is produced and consumed by many pathways and its concentration is inconstant resulting in complicated interactions among nc10 bacteria other microbes and environmental factors 3 5 effects of environmental changes on sediment methane flux to investigate the potential effects of environmental changes including fluctuations in methane organic matter and ammonia in sediments and methane organic matter ammonia nitrate nitrite and oxygen in overlying water on methane oxidizers and sediment methane emission nine simulations were performed using the model scenarios vi and vii in table 1 simulations involving changes in environmental factors were repeated in triplicate to avoid reporting possible artefactual phenomena an atmospheric methane concentration of 1840 ppb pratscher et al 2018 was adopted in the simulations and the corresponding concentration of methane in overlying water was calculated to be approximately 2 3 nm he et al 2013 as expected rapid increases in sediment methane were followed by increased methane emission fig 8 a remarkably the results showed that the sediments sometimes served as atmospheric methane sinks in days 116 208 316 407 and 516 607 both mob and nc10 bacteria increased after each increase in methane and decreased after each fallback of methane which could be explained by methane availability in sediments the average amount of methane emission in the simulated 700 days was 6 94 nmol m2 day slightly higher than that with no change in methane 6 25 nmol m2 day fig 8a similarly the sediments became atmospheric methane sinks after each decrease in sediment ammonia or organic matter fig 8b and c each increase in ammonia and organic matter has the potential to reduce the nitrite concentration and thus inhibit nc10 bacteria however mob abundance increased due to more available methane in the upper sediments the average methane emission in the simulations of ammonia and organic matter shocks was 9 70 and 18 26 nmol m2 day respectively higher than that with no changes 6 25 nmol m2 day the strong negative correlation between the drops in methane emission and the increases in mob biomass see fig 8 suggest that the atmospheric methane sink effect could be attributed to excess mob after each environmental fluctuation many experimental studies have demonstrated that global atmospheric methane concentration was too low to grow mob cai et al 2016 pratscher et al 2018 hence mob abundance dropped after each shock and the sediments gradually returned to acting as atmospheric methane sources fig 8 fig 9 shows the influence of environmental changes in the overlying water on sediment methane emission all of the simulated changes in organic matter ammonia nitrate nitrite and oxygen in overlying water altered methane source and sink dynamics and increased the total methane emission from sediments these findings may explain previous observations that some sediments in changing environments sometimes can be atmospheric methane sinks he et al 2019 olsson et al 2015 sun et al 2013 xu et al 2014 moreover the adjustment of the microbial community in response to methane flux was generally slower than the changes in environmental factors which might be the reason of the increased total methane emission under unstable environments 4 conclusion a sediment model modified from the traditional biofilm model was developed calibrated and performed to investigate the underlying relationships among different microbial communities and environmental factors in addition to their influences on sediment methane emission because of the close spatial proximity of ecological niches competition for methane between mob and nc10 bacteria and competition for nitrite between nc10 and anaob bacteria occurred at depths of 0 4 1 1 and 0 2 2 0 cm respectively under the simulated conditions nc10 bacteria were a critical and irreplaceable methane sink in aquatic sediments and methane emission increased if growth of these bacteria was limited by anaob bacteria or environmental factors the effects of some environmental factors such as oxygen and ammonia on the methanotrophic community and methane emission were extremely complicated due to many positive and negative effects involved rapid changes in environmental factors changed the microbial community and altered methane fluxes resulting in sediments sometimes acting as atmospheric methane sinks these results from the theoretical model might offer an explanation for previous experimental findings that some unstable sediments are atmospheric methane sinks it should be noted however that these conclusions are drawn from theoretical calculations and more experimental data are required to support them declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18481,methane fluxes from aqueous sediments strongly influence global atmospheric methane however many questions still puzzle researchers for example why are some unstable sediments atmospheric methane sinks in this study a biofilm model originally developed for wastewater treatment was modified to simulate the microbial kinetics and substance conversions in aqueous surface sediments the model was validated by the experimental data and could predict chemical profiles and microbial distributions in sediments the model revealed complicated interactions between different microbial communities and environmental factors including competition between aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidizing bacteria and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria the results of model simulations showed that the effects of environmental factors especially dissolved oxygen and ammonia in overlying water on methane fluxes are very complicated rapid environmental changes which can be caused by tide day night alternation or zoobenthic and human activity and intensive competition between microbes greatly affected methane fluxes and resulted in alternation between atmospheric methane source and sink in unstable sediments this study extends the application of a wastewater treatment model to ecological studies of microbial interactions in natural sediments and explains some problems that might be difficult to resolve by using experimental methods graphical abstract image 1 keywords atmospheric methane sink nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation environmental factors interspecies competition mathematical modeling 1 introduction methane is a trace gas in the atmosphere but contributes to approximately 20 of the global greenhouse effect due to its high greenhouse warming potential a dramatic increase in atmospheric methane has been observed over the past hundred years from 880 ppb in 1900 etheridge et al 1998 to 1840 ppb currently nisbet et al 2016 pratscher et al 2018 thompson et al 2018 increasing concerns about global methane transport and transformation aquatic sediments are regarded as a critical source of atmospheric methane and sedimentary methane is emitted to the atmosphere through ebullition and diffusion maeck et al 2013 this sedimentary methane is originally produced by methanogenic archaea from anaerobic degradation of organic carbon most of it can usually be oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria or archaea in the sediment before emission conrad 2009 he et al 2018b shen et al 2019b biological processes are greatly dependent on environmental conditions and methane emission from sediment likely is sensitive to environmental changes especially in shallow waters some sediments were recently shown to be weak atmospheric methane sinks in unstable aquatic environments for example coastal sediments where environmental conditions change frequently due to periodic tides day night alternation and zoobenthic and human activity he et al 2019 olsson et al 2015 sun et al 2013 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2014 however the causes of these weak methane sinks are still not clear methane oxidation in sediment was once believed to be driven by archaeal anaerobic oxidation of methane aom in marine systems and by bacterial aerobic methane oxidation aerobic mo in freshwater environments studies in the past decades have demonstrated that aom processes including nitrite nitrate sulfate and metal dependent aoms also occur in freshwater and coastal sediments cai et al 2018 he et al 2018b hu et al 2014 norði and thamdrup 2014 segarra et al 2015 wang et al 2019 nitrite aom is performed by a unique bacterial taxon in nc10 phylum that produces intracellular dioxygen from nitrite and oxidizes methane through a traditional aerobic pathway ettwig et al 2010 he et al 2018a an aerobic enzyme particulate methane monooxygenase pmmo is used by nc10 methane oxidizers for methane activation wu et al 2012 possibly due to the wide distribution of methane and nitrite nc10 methane oxidizers seem to be ubiquitous in aquatic environments chen et al 2015a guerrero cruz et al 2019 shen et al 2016 zhu et al 2015 their ecological niche is thought to be near the oxic anoxic interface and some studies suggest that they thrive in sediments where nitrite and methane profiles overlap deutzmann et al 2014 he et al 2019 nitrate aom is carried out by archaeal lineage anme 2d haroon et al 2013 in environments like paddy soils and freshwater sediments ding et al 2014 shen et al 2017 shi et al 2013 vaksmaa et al 2016 aerobic methane oxidation occurs where oxygen and methane profiles overlap i e the oxic anoxic interface because of the close spatial proximity of the ecological niches of mob and nc10 methane oxidizers deutzmann et al 2014 intense competition for methane may exist between them however the prevalence of this competition and its impact on methane fluxes are unknown to date although they may be important for global methane cycle in this study based on the similarities between sediment and biofilm with respect to microbial distributions and chemical profiles a sediment model was developed by modifying the traditional biofilm model this model was then used to predict microbial abundance and methane emission rates under stable and unstable environmental conditions this modeling approach revealed interactions between different microbial communities and environmental factors as well as the alternation of atmospheric methane sources and sinks in unstable sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development based on the similarities between aqueous sediment and biofilm matrixes for example their chemical profiles and microbial distributions a biofilm model originally developed for wastewater treatment was modified to simulate the mass transfer and microbial conversion in aqueous surface sediments defined as the top 5 cm layer the surface sediments are regarded as the system in this model the overlying water and the deep sediments the environment influence the boundary conditions of the surface sediments fig 1 the similar distributions of substances and microbes in aqueous surface sediments and oxygen based membrane biofilm are shown in fig 1 the oxygen based membrane biofilm was designed to treat anaerobic effluent containing dissolved methane ammonia and organic matter as previously described chen et al 2015b reducible substances including methane ammonia and organic matter are provided on one side of biofilm sediment the lower boundary in fig 1 anaerobic effluent deep sediments whereas the oxidizer oxygen is supplied on the other side the upper boundary in fig 1 hollow fiber membrane overlying water resulting in similar chemical profiles and microbial distributions in the surface sediments eight types of microbes including ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anammox anaob aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria mob nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidizing bacteria nitrite damo nc10 nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea nitrate damo anme 2d and heterotrophic bacteria hb and 19 microbial processes listed in table s1 were considered we previously observed partial denitrification microbial reduction of nitrate into nitrite in sediments he et al 2019 and represented it in this model by introducing a new coefficient of partial denitrification fraction f pdn see fig s1 the partial denitrification fraction is defined as a ratio of nitrite production to nitrate reduction g n g n its value was calculated to be 0 321 based on the best fit of the experimental data see fig s2 six soluble species and ten solid species are involved in this model see table s2 the soluble species include dissolved methane s ch4 ammonia s nh4 organic matter om s s oxygen s o2 nitrate s no3 and nitrite s no2 the solid species are active biomass of aob x aob aoa x aoa nob x nob anaob x ana mob x mob nc10 bacteria x nc10 anme 2d archaea x anme and heterotrophic bacteria x h in addition to decomposition substance x s and inter biomass x i 2 2 model implementation the aqueous surface sediments were modeled in the program aquasim 2 1 reichert 1998 as presented in fig s3 a completely mixed compartment overlying water compartment and a biofilm compartment sediment compartment were developed to simulate the overlying water and sediments respectively these two compartments were connected with a diffusive link which models the mass transfer between overlying water and sediments a virtual high liquid flow 100 m3 d was designed in the biofilm compartment to keep the substance steady at the lower boundary of the surface sediments whereas a relatively low liquid flow 1 m3 d was adopted in the overlying water compartment to improve the calculation precision of methane efflux from sediments to overlying water through the upper boundary of the surface sediments these virtual flows are mathematic means to keep the boundary conditions steady or improve the precision of numerical calculation they do not represent real liquid flows methane efflux from sediment was calculated by the following function s ch4 out s ch4 in hrt v a where s ch4 in and s ch4 out are dissolved methane concentrations in influent and effluent of the overlying water compartments respectively hrt is hydraulic retention time of the compartment volume flow v is the volume of the overlying water compartment and a is the sediment surface area in contact with overlying water the stoichiometric matrix between microbial processes and variables is given in table s2 the stoichiometric coefficients of nitrate and nitrite of process 17 growth of hb using nitrate were modified because partial denitrification was considered in this model the values of stoichiometric coefficients kinetic parameters and diffusion coefficients involved in the model were obtained from previous literature and presented in tables s3 s4 and s5 respectively the substrate concentrations in overlying water and deep sediments at 5 cm depth were adopted from our previous experiments see table s6 he et al 2019 and used as default options in the model simulations unless otherwise specified seven types of simulation scenarios were used as described in table 1 2 3 correlation assumption interactions among microbes and environmental conditions are receiving increasing attention because they greatly influence methane flux in sediments thus the correlations among them were assumed in this work based on principles such as microbial substrate dependence microbial growth is often determined by limiting substrates see table s1 for the kinetic rate expressions of microbial growth competition is possible between microbial groups with a common substrate for example mob and nc10 bacteria compete for the common substrate of methane conversely a cooperative relationship may develop when the product of one microbe is the substrate of another microbe for example the cooperation between aob and nob fig 1 direct relationships between microbes and environmental factors are assumed that substrates stimulate microbial growth positive correlation or inhibitors reduce their growth negative correlation we summarize relationships in fig 2 and the interaction network is considerably complicated because some indirect influences are involved for example sediment methane can directly stimulate mob as a substrate but it also indirectly restricts the growth of mob through its effect on nc10 bacteria sediment methane greatly stimulates nc10 bacterial growth a high level of nc10 lowers surface methane concentration limiting mob growth similarly overlying water methane may inhibit nc10 bacteria by stimulating mob growth 3 results and discussion 3 1 model simulation and validation the model was applied to predict the microbial kinetics involved in carbon and nitrogen cycles in the aquatic surface sediments and the simulation results were validated by experimental data the partial denitrification fraction f pdn was estimated to be 0 321 according to the time course concentrations of nitrate and nitrite from a batch test of sediments amended with nitrate fig s2 the concentrations of dissolved oxygen do nitrate nitrite ammonia organic matter om and methane in overlying water and deep sediments at 5 cm depth were served as two boundary conditions the upper and lower boundaries of the modeled surface sediments and their values were obtained from our previous measurements table s6 he et al 2019 the simulation results of chemical and microbial profiles in the surface sediments scenario i in table 1 as well as the experimental data are shown in fig 3 the results indicated that all of the chemical profiles methane oxygen nitrate and nitrite could be predicted by the model fig 3a combining the diffusion equation of fick s law and mass balance conditions substrate consumption is directly proportional to the second derivative of the chemical profile a bend in the profile curve li and katsev 2014 the modeled methane profile was bended at the depth of 0 4 2 4 cm and close to be linear in depths of 0 0 4 and 2 4 5 0 cm indicating that methane was mostly consumed between 0 4 and 2 4 cm this finding was consistent with the experimental measurements of methane consumption from sliced sediments in which methane was mostly consumed in the depth of 0 5 2 0 cm he et al 2019 similarly the oxygen and nitrate nitrite profiles showed that oxygen and nitrate nitrite were consumed in the top 1 cm and 4 cm sediments respectively the penetration depths of oxygen and nitrate nitrite were therefore about 1 and 4 cm respectively in accord with many previous observations deutzmann et al 2014 neumann et al 2017 norði and thamdrup 2014 under the simulated conditions mob were in the top 1 cm of sediment nc10 bacteria were dominant in sediments of 0 4 2 4 cm in depth and anme 2d archaea were negligible in the top 5 cm of sediments fig 3b the community distribution from the simulation was in line with the experimental findings although the absolute values were different the distributions of mob and nc10 bacteria could be explained by the different penetration depths of oxygen and nitrate nitrite discussed above the very low abundance of anme 2d archaea not detected in many sediments in our previous experiments could be attributed to their poor affinity of methane he et al 2019 lu et al 2019 the microbial profiles of aoa aob nob and anaob indicated that aoa and nob were in the top 1 cm of sediments anaob were at a depth of 0 2 2 0 cm and aob were negligible under the simulated conditions fig 3c 3 2 important role of nc10 bacteria in sediment methane flux experimental results have indicated that nc10 bacteria were the largest methane sink in sediments of 0 5 2 0 cm depth he et al 2019 we wondered whether methane efflux would increase if nc10 bacteria were absent in these sediments this question is difficult to answer with current experimental approaches because the role of nc10 bacteria cannot to our knowledge be separately excluded acetylene a pmmo inhibitor is known to inhibit the activity of nc10 bacteria but it also inhibits mob ettwig et al 2010 he et al 2019 padilla et al 2016 therefore addition of acetylene would simultaneously inhibit mob and nc10 bacteria however nc10 bacteria can be easily excluded using the model approach to predict methane efflux in the absence of nc10 bacteria the microbial processes growth and decay of nc10 bacteria see table s1 were set to be inactive in the simulations see scenarios ii and iii in table 1 fig 4 a shows the simulation results of methane emission with and without nc10 bacteria under different do concentrations fixed do value in each simulation in overlying water the methane emission curves almost overlap except in the do range of 2 75 5 0 mg l this implies that the role of nc10 bacteria could be replaced by mob except at do values of 2 75 5 0 mg l microbial abundance with and without nc10 bacteria was calculated with overlying water do of 2 4 and 8 mg l figs s4 and s5 decreasing do from 8 to 4 mg l largely reduced the abundance of mob possibly causing the high methane emission in the do range of 2 75 5 0 mg l the competition between mob and aoa for oxygen might be one cause of mob reduction as shown previously alam and jia 2012 daebeler et al 2014 the abundance of nc10 bacteria was also limited but still contributed to methane consumption in the do range of 2 75 5 0 mg l resulting in relatively low methane emissions methane emission with and without nc10 bacteria under daily changing do conditions is shown in fig 4b scenario iii in table 1 methane emission changed daily with the variation in overlying water do in simulations with and without nc10 bacteria methane emissions increased rapidly when do decreased from 8 to 2 mg l and quickly decreased to low levels when do returned to 8 mg l remarkably the fluctuation of methane emission was smaller in the simulation with nc10 bacteria than that without nc10 bacteria and the average rate of methane emission was also lower in the former 2 14 vs 2 46 μmol m2 d this clearly indicates the important role of nc10 bacteria in methane emission reduction under changing environments previous works demonstrated that nc10 bacteria were the major methane sink of sediments in some stable environments deutzmann et al 2014 graf et al 2018 the findings above suggest the prediction that nc10 bacteria might be more important in unstable environments in which their roles could not be substituted by mob 3 3 substrate competition between mob and nc10 bacteria because the ecological niches of mob and nc10 bacteria are spatially adjacent and partially overlap competitive interactions between these species for methane substrate have been proposed he et al 2019 coexistence of mob and nc10 bacteria in sediments has been observed in natural environments such as lake sediments kojima et al 2012 liu et al 2015 moreover in previous ecological investigations methane consumption by nc10 bacteria could have been easily mistakenly attributed to mob due to their proximity and niche overlap in aquatic sediments deutzmann et al 2014 in this work the potential competition for methane between mob and nc10 bacteria was assessed by modeling the microbial profiles of mob with and without nc10 bacteria and the profiles of nc10 bacteria with and without mob scenario i in table 1 fig 5 a comparison of mob profiles with and without nc10 bacteria revealed that mob at depth of 0 4 1 1 cm were largely restricted in the presence of nc10 bacteria while mob at 0 0 4 cm were not significantly influenced by nc10 bacteria fig 5a similarly nc10 bacteria at depth of 0 1 1 4 cm were inhibited by mob while nc10 bacteria in the deeper sediments were only slightly affected by mob intensive competition between mob and nc10 bacteria occurs in the hypoxia zone depth of 0 4 1 1 cm under the simulated conditions do 0 but 1 0 mg l where mob and nc10 bacteria coexist since oxygen and nitrate nitrite are ubiquitous we predict that methane competition between mob and nc10 bacteria occurs frequently in hypoxia zones for instance nc10 bacteria and their activity were detected in marine oxygen minimum zones off northern mexico and costa rica padilla et al 2016 so methane competition between mob and nc10 bacteria might also occur in such environments methane profiles were distinguishably different between the three simulations above fig 5b the presence of nc10 bacteria resulted in a lower level of methane in the deep sediments 0 7 cm whereas the presence of mob lowered the surface 0 4 cm methane concentrations to trace levels greatly reducing methane emission into the atmosphere moreover the interactions between mob and nc10 bacteria were influenced by other taxa like anaob the profiles of mob and nc10 bacteria with and without anaob in the sediments are shown in fig s6 nc10 bacteria would be much more abundant and the niche would be deeper in the absence of anaob but mob would be outcompeted by a large number of nc10 bacteria due to the low concentrations of the key competing substrate nitrite and the overlap of niches 0 2 2 0 cm see fig 3b and c intensive competitive interactions between anaob and nc10 bacteria could be expected in many aquatic sediments the competitive interactions between anaob and nc10 bacteria have been observed in enrichment cultures fu et al 2017 hu et al 2015 luesken et al 2011 and co occurrence of anaob and nc10 bacteria has been discovered in various natural settings chen and gu 2017 shen et al 2019a xu et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 the indirect effects of non methane oxidizers like aoa and anaob on the methane cycle are also an interesting topic in complex natural environments 3 4 effects of environmental factors on sediment methane flux the effects of sediment environmental factors including dissolved methane organic matter and ammonia on the abundance of methane oxidizers and sediment methane emission were investigated fig 6 increasing sediment methane greatly raised the abundance of nc10 bacteria but only slightly increased the abundance of mob this might be because sediment methane was diffused from the deep sediments to the surface and nc10 bacteria at relatively deep sediments have an advantage over the uppermost mob he et al 2019 sediment methane seemed to be a critical factor stimulating nc10 bacteria this is supported by previous findings of high abundance of nc10 bacteria in soil sediment zones containing high concentrations of methane hu et al 2014 shen et al 2019b methane emission did not increase with an increase in sediment methane remaining restricted to a low level of 6 25 nmol m2 d this demonstrates the ability of methane oxidizers to reduce methane emission from sediments in stable environments sediment ammonia was found to inhibit nc10 bacteria and simulate mob and sediment methane emission increased exponentially in the tested range of sediment ammonia fig 6b the decrease in nc10 bacteria could be explained by the competition for nitrite with anaob as described above sediment ammonia encouraged the growth of anaob and then depleted nitrite resulting in the decline of the nc10 population the complicated effects of sediment organic matter on the abundance of methane oxidizers and the rate of methane emission are shown in fig 6c organic matter in upper sediments consumes oxygen nitrate and nitrite possibly limiting the growth of mob and nc10 bacteria overall as expected sediment organic matter increased methane emission however in the low concentrations of 0 7 mg cod l sediment organic matter greatly stimulated growth of nc10 bacteria and reduced methane emission as the penetration of nitrate is generally much deeper than that of oxygen in sediments deutzmann et al 2014 he et al 2019 norði and thamdrup 2014 the sediment nitrite below the oxic zone might be mostly derived from nitrate reduction by partial denitrification the deficiency of sediment organic matter restricted the activity of partial denitrification lowered the generation of nitrite and thereby limited the growth of nc10 bacteria this pathway of nitrite supply to nc10 bacteria was also examined by previous researchers and significant correlations between nc10 bacteria and organic matter were observed in some sediments shen et al 2015 the effects of dissolved methane organic matter ammonia nitrate nitrite and oxygen in overlying water on the abundance of mob and nc10 bacteria and the rate of methane emission are shown in fig 7 as expected dissolved methane in the overlying water stimulated the growth of mob and the sediments could take in methane from overlying water if the methane concentration exceeded 2 4 nm note that solubility of atmospheric methane is approximately 2 3 nm fig 7a oscillation of nc10 bacteria was observed this might be because overlying water methane stimulated nc10 bacterial growth by providing methane but inhibited it through intensifying competition with mob obviously the available methane in subsurface sediments for nc10 bacteria would decrease when mob is abundant nc10 bacterial growth was inhibited stimulated and almost completely inhibited by overlying water ammonia of 0 5 2 0 2 0 3 5 and 4 0 mg n l respectively fig 7b overlying water ammonia simultaneously stimulated and inhibited nc10 bacteria with complicated results overlying water ammonia could stimulate nc10 bacteria through increasing nitrite production by aoa aob but suppress them via increasing nitrite consumption by anaob see fig 2 indeed both the positive and negative correlations between ammonia and nc10 bacteria have been observed in the ecological studies chen and gu 2017 long et al 2017 it was expected that increasing nitrate nitrite stimulated the growth of nc10 bacteria fig 7c and d notably nitrate concentration from 0 to 1 0 mg n l dramatically mitigated methane emission in the presence of nitrate in sediments reducing substrates like organic matter and ammonia can be consumed by microbes this increases oxygen penetration which is favorable to mob and methane emission reduction nitrite slightly increased methane emission from sediments which might be explained by the decrease in mob that have a high affinity for low levels of methane cai et al 2016 pratscher et al 2018 organic matter in overlying water increased methane emission and decreased nc10 bacteria fig 7e the reason for the decline in nc10 bacteria might be that nitrite was depleted by excess organic matter zhu et al 2018 as shown in fig 7f the effects of overlying water do on mob and nc10 bacteria were complex and frequently fluctuated there was a negative correlation between mob abundance and methane emission when do was 5 mg l large increases in mob were always followed by great reductions of methane emission for example under conditions like do ranges of 0 2 and 4 5 mg l a competitive relationship between mob and nc10 bacteria was clearly seen with increases in nc10 bacteria always followed by a decrease in mob and vice versa fig 7f such competition was very intense and a slight increase in do might change microbial abundance and greatly influence methane emission only when the overlying water do was above 6 5 mg l suitable microbial community structures of mob and nc10 bacteria were formed to reduce methane emission under low levels 0 05 μmol m2 d in summary the key factor controlling nc10 bacteria might be nitrite nitrite is produced and consumed by many pathways and its concentration is inconstant resulting in complicated interactions among nc10 bacteria other microbes and environmental factors 3 5 effects of environmental changes on sediment methane flux to investigate the potential effects of environmental changes including fluctuations in methane organic matter and ammonia in sediments and methane organic matter ammonia nitrate nitrite and oxygen in overlying water on methane oxidizers and sediment methane emission nine simulations were performed using the model scenarios vi and vii in table 1 simulations involving changes in environmental factors were repeated in triplicate to avoid reporting possible artefactual phenomena an atmospheric methane concentration of 1840 ppb pratscher et al 2018 was adopted in the simulations and the corresponding concentration of methane in overlying water was calculated to be approximately 2 3 nm he et al 2013 as expected rapid increases in sediment methane were followed by increased methane emission fig 8 a remarkably the results showed that the sediments sometimes served as atmospheric methane sinks in days 116 208 316 407 and 516 607 both mob and nc10 bacteria increased after each increase in methane and decreased after each fallback of methane which could be explained by methane availability in sediments the average amount of methane emission in the simulated 700 days was 6 94 nmol m2 day slightly higher than that with no change in methane 6 25 nmol m2 day fig 8a similarly the sediments became atmospheric methane sinks after each decrease in sediment ammonia or organic matter fig 8b and c each increase in ammonia and organic matter has the potential to reduce the nitrite concentration and thus inhibit nc10 bacteria however mob abundance increased due to more available methane in the upper sediments the average methane emission in the simulations of ammonia and organic matter shocks was 9 70 and 18 26 nmol m2 day respectively higher than that with no changes 6 25 nmol m2 day the strong negative correlation between the drops in methane emission and the increases in mob biomass see fig 8 suggest that the atmospheric methane sink effect could be attributed to excess mob after each environmental fluctuation many experimental studies have demonstrated that global atmospheric methane concentration was too low to grow mob cai et al 2016 pratscher et al 2018 hence mob abundance dropped after each shock and the sediments gradually returned to acting as atmospheric methane sources fig 8 fig 9 shows the influence of environmental changes in the overlying water on sediment methane emission all of the simulated changes in organic matter ammonia nitrate nitrite and oxygen in overlying water altered methane source and sink dynamics and increased the total methane emission from sediments these findings may explain previous observations that some sediments in changing environments sometimes can be atmospheric methane sinks he et al 2019 olsson et al 2015 sun et al 2013 xu et al 2014 moreover the adjustment of the microbial community in response to methane flux was generally slower than the changes in environmental factors which might be the reason of the increased total methane emission under unstable environments 4 conclusion a sediment model modified from the traditional biofilm model was developed calibrated and performed to investigate the underlying relationships among different microbial communities and environmental factors in addition to their influences on sediment methane emission because of the close spatial proximity of ecological niches competition for methane between mob and nc10 bacteria and competition for nitrite between nc10 and anaob bacteria occurred at depths of 0 4 1 1 and 0 2 2 0 cm respectively under the simulated conditions nc10 bacteria were a critical and irreplaceable methane sink in aquatic sediments and methane emission increased if growth of these bacteria was limited by anaob bacteria or environmental factors the effects of some environmental factors such as oxygen and ammonia on the methanotrophic community and methane emission were extremely complicated due to many positive and negative effects involved rapid changes in environmental factors changed the microbial community and altered methane fluxes resulting in sediments sometimes acting as atmospheric methane sinks these results from the theoretical model might offer an explanation for previous experimental findings that some unstable sediments are atmospheric methane sinks it should be noted however that these conclusions are drawn from theoretical calculations and more experimental data are required to support them declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18482,this study developed an intermittent oxidation reduction potential orp controlled micro aeration system for high solids anaerobic digestion ad of lignocellulosic biomass without volatile fatty acids vfa accumulation at high organic loading rate olr traditional ad of napier grass a model lignocellulosic biomass at an olr of 5 g volatile solids vs l day resulted in an accumulation of total vfa concentration up to 9 2 g l as acetic acid hac equivalent causing rapid drops in ph and methane yield and driving the digester to the verge of failure once intermittent every 24 h orp controlled micro aeration at orp of 470 mv was initiated the total vfa concentration rapidly decreased to 3 0 g hac l and the methane yield improved resulting in stable digester performance without the need for alkalinity supplementation or olr reduction by combining reactor performance results mass balance analyses microbial community characterization data and a bioenergetic evaluation this study suggested that rapid vfa conversion and ch4 production were carried out by facultative anaerobes and hydrogenotrophic methanogens under micro aerobic conditions this novel operating approach can be applied as an effective control strategy for high olr ad processes especially in the event of vfa accumulation graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion vfa accumulation micro aeration oxidation reduction potential orp microbial community metabolic pathway 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad has received increased attention in recent years due to several inherent merits including its ability to produce renewable energy from diverse organic materials remediate waste streams and curtail greenhouse gas emissions surendra et al 2015 limitations of the ad process however are rooted in the intrinsic difficulty of maintaining a balance among the activities of hydrolytic acidogenic acetogenic and methanogenic microorganisms slow digestibility especially when fed with recalcitrant substrates such as lignocellulosic biomass is the main reason for low methane yield sawatdeenarunat et al 2015 to overcome this limitation digesters are commonly operated at high organic loading rates olrs using feedstocks with a high total solids ts content however at high olrs digesters are susceptible to failure due to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfa mainly acetic propionic and butyric acids caused by an imbalance between syntrophic acetogenic bacteria and methanogens boe and angelidaki 2012 ward et al 2008 this syntrophic relationship is extremely sensitive since the hydrogen partial pressure ph2 has to be low enough for the anaerobic degradation of vfa to be thermodynamically favorable but high enough for the consumption by h2 utilizing methanogens dolfing 2014 labib et al 1993 failure to maintain this delicate balance leads to ad process failure due to vfa build up and may require restarting of the digester thereby causing significant economic loss dong et al 2011 steyer et al 2006 hence there is a critical need to develop effective control strategies to maintain stability and rapid recovery of ad processes from potential failure with simultaneous enhancement of hydrolysis vfa utilization and methane production to this end we developed a unique approach of improving digester stability by intermittently injecting small amount of oxygen micro aeration the timing of which is controlled by oxidation reduction potential orp traditionally oxygen or air exposure is avoided in ad systems to minimize its negative impact on anaerobic microorganisms however methanogenesis was recently found to occur outside of anaerobic environments as well such as in oxygenated freshwater and soil angle et al 2017 recent studies have also shown that micro aeration in anaerobic processes can enhance hydrolysis rate methane yield vfa production and hydrogen sulfide removal nguyen and khanal 2018 the underlying rationale for the beneficial effects of micro aeration on ad processes is the augmentation in diversity and activity of facultative bacteria that promote hydrolysis fermentation and sulfide oxidation krayzelova et al 2015 lim et al 2013 zhu et al 2009 based on the above reasoning we hypothesized that vfa accumulated in the digesters during overload conditions would be rapidly consumed by facultative heterotrophs under micro aerobic conditions thus contributing to ad process stability to use micro aeration as an effective operational strategy in ad precise oxygen dosing control is needed to prevent overdosing and inhibition of anaerobic metabolisms very limited studies have focused on an effective micro aeration dosing system that can be applied in the ad processes nguyen and khanal 2018 oxidation reduction potential orp or redox potential which exhibits a logarithmic relationship with dissolved oxygen concentration fig s1 can be used for precise oxygen dosing control during micro aeration this approach was previously applied in biological hydrogen sulfide removal khanal and huang 2003a b and in pure culture fermentation processes to augment the product yield liu et al 2013 however insights into the effects of orp controlled micro aeration on metabolic pathways and synergistic interactions between aerobic anaerobic and bacterial archaeal populations in ad process are still lacking the overall goal of this study was to develop and validate the performance of an orp based micro aeration system to prevent vfa accumulation without the inhibition of methanogenesis during ad of lignocellulosic feedstock at high olr after investigating the effects of increasing olr on ad performance orp based micro aeration was initiated to examine for ad process stability control by combining reactor performance and microbial community analyses with bioenergetics and mass balance calculations we provide new insights into the dynamics of orp controlled micro aeration in ad process and present an effective strategy for maintaining the stability of a highly loaded ad system 2 materials and methods 2 1 feedstock and inoculum napier grass pennisetum purpureum 5 months old a typical energy crop

of the reactor in replicate 1 is primarily discussed in the main manuscript and the results from replicates 2 and 3 are given in appendix a the bioreactor in replicate 1 was operated anaerobically at olrs of 1 5 3 0 and 5 0 g vs l day from days 1 30 42 60 and 75 116 respectively table s6 between each of these three operating periods the olr was increased in a step wise increment of 0 5 g vs l day till stable performance a quasi steady state was achieved no significant difference anova p 0 05 in each monitoring parameter during five consecutive days of operation in this study the term stable with above definition is used instead of quasi steady state for brevity alkalinity was periodically supplemented by adding nahco3 mainly under anaerobic conditions at high olr to maintain the ph above 6 0 the reactor was operated in a semi continuous mode by daily withdrawal of digestate followed by feeding a mixture of biomass napier grass and distilled water to maintain desired olrs and constant hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days orp based micro aeration was initiated on day 117 in replicate 1 at olr 5 0 g vs l day when the bioreactor showed signs of instability and the performance of this bioreactor was further divided into four periods for comparison namely 5 0 stable days 75 94 anaerobic condition before rapid vfa accumulation 5 0 unstable days 95 116 anaerobic condition with

airgas hi usa was finely adjusted at 1 ml min using a two staged low pressure regulator and a needle valve a digital timer was used to automatically monitor the total micro aeration time in seconds the reactor was subjected to micro aeration every other day fig s2 the micro aeration intensity l o2 l reactor day was calculated by multiplying the oxygen flow rate with the daily micro aeration time

under anaerobic and micro aerobic conditions were collected from the bioreactor in replicate 1 on days 79 and 149 replicate 2 on days 150 and 192 and replicate 3 on days 64 and 108 respectively when the olr was 5 g vs l day the collected biomass samples were subjected to dna extraction using the power soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc canada as per the manufacturer s instructions the bacterial and methanogenic communities were investigated by targeting the 16s rrna gene using 515f 806r primers and the mcra gene using mcra3f mcra3r primers respectively caporaso et al 2012 luton et al 2002 sequencing was performed using the illumina hiseq2000 platform and sequence reads were processed using mothur version 1 35 0 schloss et al 2009 chimeras were removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 bacterial 16s rrna gene fragments were aligned against the silva database release 123 pruesse et al 2007 and mcra gene fragments against a subset of the fun gene database fish et al 2013 resulting in taxonomic labels for each aligned fragment the raw sequence reads were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive sra http www ncbi nlm nih gov sra under accession numbers samn12752316

0 05 3 results 3 1 bioreactor performance without micro aeration at olr of 1 5 3 0 and 5 0 g vs l day increasing the olr resulted in significant increases in total vfa individual vfas acetate propionate and butyrate vfa alk ratio and ts content in the reactor with concomitant decreases in methane yield ph and vs removal efficiency stable operation was achieved at olrs of 1 5 and 3 0 g vs l day with an average methane yield of 102 105 4 nml g vs added which was comparable to other studies using the same substrate sawatdeenarunat et al 2015 surendra and khanal 2014 when the olr was increased to 5 0 g vs l day the reactor performance began to deteriorate table 1 in replicate 1 the bioreactor operating at an olr of 5 0 g vs l day from day 75 showed a rapid accumulation of vfas fig 2 b and c which led to decreases in ph and methane yield fig 2a and b the bioreactor was particularly unstable from days 95 116 as the total vfa had increased to 9 0 g acetic acid equivalent hac l the vfa alk ratio was 2 0 and the ph had dropped to 5 5 resulting in a reduction in the methane yield to as low as 5 0 nml g vs regardless of attempts to stabilize the bioreactor through alkalinity supplementations fig 2a the results demonstrated that mono digestion of napier grass under mesophilic conditions started to experience organic overloading at olr 5 0 g vs l day to overcome this limitation the effectiveness of intermittent orp controlled micro aeration 24 h every other day to obtain stable bioreactor performance under high olr was examined 3 2 bioreactor performance with intermittent orp controlled micro aeration at olr of 5 0 g vs l day the intermittent orp controlled micro aeration operation was started on day 117 in replicate 1 fig 2 within 12 days the total vfa concentration decreased from 9 2 to 3 0 g hac l and the acetic acid concentration dropped from 4 0 g l to less than 0 7 g l fig 2c with a concomitant increase in methane yield from 40 to 114 nml g vs fig 2b all other important parameters stabilized as well fig 2 suggesting full recovery of the bioreactor stable operation of the bioreactor at high olr continued even under anaerobic conditions from days 156 215 after intermittent micro aeration was terminated however from days 215 242 the gradual accumulation of vfa was observed likely leading to another unstable period under anaerobic condition replicates 2 and 3 confirmed the effectiveness of orp controlled micro aeration on digester stability the recovery trends in replicates 2 and 3 figs s3 and s4 were similar to those in replicate 1 for example a drop in the total vfa level from 10 8 to 5 0 g hac l and from 9 2 to 2 1 g hac l with concomitant increase in methane yields from 5 to 102 nml g vs and from 21 to 125 nml g vs were observed after micro aeration was initiated in replicates 2 and 3 respectively figs s3 and s4 these replicate experiments confirmed the effectiveness of intermittent micro aeration to control vfa accumulation and to maintain bioreactor stability the average values of important performance parameters for the three replicates are summarized in table 1 intermittent micro aeration was achieved by controlling the orp at a setpoint of 470 mv 25 mv above the anaerobic baseline orp of 495 mv fig 2e for a 24 h period followed by a 24 h period without micro aeration the orp levels varied from an average of 468 4 mv to an average of 522 12 mv during the days with and without micro aeration respectively indicating a rapid exhaustion of residual dissolved oxygen do and a switching back to anaerobic conditions also the average daily orp of the anaerobic period after micro aeration days 156 242 remained fairly stable at a baseline orp level of 530 9 mv fig 2e the orp levels during anaerobic and micro aerobic conditions were in close agreement with those in previous studies jenicek et al 2011 khanal and huang 2006 thus intermittent orp based micro aeration was instrumental in digester recovery from the verge of failure without supplementation of alkalinity and or reducing the olr 3 3 micro aeration enhanced carbon recovery the results of a carbon mass balance performed before and after micro aeration in three replicate experiments fig 3 indicate that micro aerobic conditions enhanced lignocellulosic degradation and carbon recovery in the form of biogas co2 and ch4 production specifically the digestate from the micro aerated condition consisted of 2 84 0 13 g carbon which was significantly lower p 0 05 than 3 66 0 13 g carbon present in the digestate without micro aeration this finding was further supported by a significant increase p 0 05 in vs reduction from 20 6 2 7 during the anaerobic unstable period to 47 3 2 7 after micro aeration was initiated table 1 this increase in substrate degradation resulted in higher soluble substrate concentrations for microbial communities and therefore significantly improved biogas production and enhanced carbon recovery in the form of co2 and ch4 in addition the removal of accumulated vfa stabilized the ph of the bioreactor and facilitated the quick recovery of the activity of methanogens thereby resulting in significant enhancement in ch4 production p 0 05 however the carbon mass balance in this study could not identify the fractions of carbon that went into each pathway within the ad process aerobic respiration or anaerobic syntrophic acetogenesis acetoclastic or hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis such information could only be obtained from carbon isotope labelling techniques gehring et al 2015 which was beyond the scope of this study 3 4 micro aeration promoted vfa conversion by facultative bacteria through aerobic respiration in traditional ad process the syntrophic interaction between acetogens and methanogens is critically important to maintain low vfa concentrations in the aqueous phase leng et al 2017a yuan et al 2011 however due to thermodynamic limitation of syntrophic acetogenic reactions leng et al 2017b this rate limiting step in ad process often causes vfa build up and leads to reactor failure as is the case in this study this study suggested a dominant mechanism of effective vfa conversion by facultative bacteria and methane production by hydrogenotrophic methanogens under controlled micro aerobic conditions the suggestion is based on mass balance analyses thermodynamic calculation and the three observations drawn from the microbial community analysis 1 the relative abundance of syntrophic bacteria remained low 1 0 of total bacteria 2 the relative abundance of facultative bacteria increased after orp based micro aeration and 3 methanogenesis was achieved mainly by hydrogenotrophic methanogens these observations are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraph the high olr of 5 0 g vs l day resulted in vfa accumulation and drops in ph and methane production table 1 suggesting a microbial imbalance before micro aeration was initiated the microbial analyses confirmed that syntrophic bacteria family syntrophaceae and syntrophomonadaceae were present at low relative abundances under anaerobic condition as their combined relative abundance accounted for less than 1 0 of total bacteria in all three replicate experiments table s2 similar microbial results were reported for ad systems subjected to stress or high vfa concentrations feng et al 2009 goux et al 2015 luo et al 2016 treu et al 2016 the relative abundance of these syntrophic acetogens remained below 1 0 table s2 after implementing micro aeration at the same time there was a significant increase in relative abundance of facultative bacteria fig 4 especially the most abundant operational taxonomy units otus associated with the genus proteiniphilum chen and dong 2005 increased from 16 to 32 following micro aeration the increase in these otus was even more distinct in replicates 2 from 2 to 65 and 3 from 1 to 43 table s2 indicating that proteiniphilum spp played an important role in converting excess vfa into co2 during intermittent orp based micro aeration in ad process additionally the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was observed in all samples obtained during micro aeration for all three replicate experiments suggesting that the increase in methane production was associated with co2 generated during the preceding aerobic respiration reactions to further reinforce the findings suggested by the microbial community analyses thermodynamic calculations were performed fig 5 thermodynamic results show that the changes in gibbs free energy associated with complete vfa oxidation to co2 using o2 as an electron acceptor δg r 91 7 to 88 2 kj e were much higher than that of incomplete vfa fermentation coupled with proton reduction δg r 11 1 to 6 9 kj e at the actual conditions of replicate 1 fig 5 these thermodynamic values at the actual conditions are also more conservative compared to values at standard conditions where vfa aerobic oxidation reactions are even more thermodynamically favorable δgo 109 kj e than those for the vfa anaerobic fermentation reactions δgo 1 to 23 kj e table s3 these results suggest that the facultative bacteria switched from anaerobic fermentation to the more thermodynamically and kinetically favorable aerobic respiration tables s3 and s4 upon the dosing of o2 for the facultative bacteria the more energetically favorable aerobic respiration could be regulated via specific gene expression forster and gescher 2014 morris and schmidt 2013 thus the vfa produced during the period without micro aeration were likely consumed by the facultative heterotrophs when micro aeration was initiated resulting in low vfa concentrations during the period with intermittent micro aeration fig 2 this increases in relative abundance of facultative bacteria while preserving methanogens for a more balanced digestion with a long lasting effect even after the micro aeration was terminated it therefore triggered the stable operation of the reactor under anaerobic condition from days 156 242 fig 2 moreover after the build up of vfa was reduced to the baseline level around 3 g l as hac via orp based micro aeration the reactor could be operated at anaerobic condition without micro aeration control for a long period through the newly established microbial community fig s6 nonetheless the duration in which the reactor could be operated anaerobically without micro aeration varied e g the stable period after stopping micro aeration in replicate 3 was relatively short fig s4 possibly due to ecologically dynamic responses axelrod and hamilton 1981 hence this intermittent micro aeration system had two purposes the first was to provide the precise amount of o2 for facultative heterotrophs to rapidly consume the accumulated vfa during unstable periods and the second was to develop a new balanced microbial community for long term stable methane production at high olrs while alkalinity addition for ph control only caused transient relief of vfa inhibition to methanogens the intermittent micro aeration system effectively scavenged excess vfa thereby maintaining digester stability during high organic loading conditions 3 5 orp controlled micro aeration maintained anaerobic niches for methanogenesis although intermittent orp based micro aeration created micro aerobic niches for vfa conversion by facultative microbes it preserved the crucial methanogens as apparent from the increased methane production figs 2 and 3 indicating a vibrant methanogenic activity even though the accumulated vfa were likely oxidized to co2 through aerobic respiration during micro aeration there was no significant change p 0 05 in the co2 content of the biogas suggesting that co2 was reduced to ch4 using h2 as an electron donor this was further supported by the finding that the most abundant methanogenic populations under intermittent micro aeration conditions were all hydrogenotrophic methanogens table s2 in replicate 1 due to the abundance of the metabolically versatile genus methanosarcina ch4 production via h2 or acetate de vrieze et al 2012 a flexible metabolic switch from acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis may have occurred during micro aeration without population succession fig 4 in replicates 2 and 3 the strictly hydrogenotrophic methanogens belonging to the genera methanobrevibacter leadbetter and breznak 1996 and methanocorpusculum gilmore et al 2017 dominated under micro aerobic conditions confirming that orp based micro aeration favoured hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis over acetoclastic methanogenesis table s2 methanogenic genera methanosarcina and methanobrevibacter are known to possess oxygen detoxifying enzymes such as superoxide dismutase sod catalase and peroxidase which might be responsible for oxygen tolerance in micro aeration conditions nguyen and khanal 2018 moreover although h2 oxidation with o2 to h2o δg r 92 7 kj e is thermodynamically more favorable than h2 reduction to ch4 δg r 4 0 kj e the supplied o2 was likely completely consumed during vfa oxidation thereby leaving the available h2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogens here the fast growing facultative heterotrophs μm 13 2 1 day appeared to have an advantage in the presence of excess vfa over slow growing h2 oxidizing bacteria μm 10 1 1 day with limited h2 availability and with similar gibbs free energy changes for aerobic oxidation of vfa and h2 δg r 88 2 to 92 7 kj e tables s3 and s4 consistent with this the otus associated with facultative heterotrophs accounted for more than 30 of the total bacteria while h2 oxidizing bacteria were not detected among the dominant otus table s2 as shown in fig 2 the reduction of h2 to an undetectable level in the biogas occurred after day 140 when the total vfa concentration was as low as 3 0 g hac l this could be due to aerobic oxidation of h2 to h2o whereas prior to day 140 all supplied o2 was likely consumed by facultative heterotrophs to oxidize accumulated vfa to co2 our results suggest that intermittent micro aeration by controlling orp level at 470 mv was insufficient to fully support aerobic growth thus facilitating anaerobic metabolism for methanogens in such micro aerobic environment further in an independent set of experiments it was observed that continuous micro aeration at an orp 25 mv higher than the baseline orp and intermittent micro aeration at an orp 50 mv higher than the baseline orp caused significant accumulation of vfa due to inhibition of methanogens as indicated by reduced methane yields table s5 the higher oxidative micro environment was unfavourable to support the co existence of facultative bacteria and anaerobic methanogens liu et al 2013 other studies have also reported that micro aeration at an orp greater than 25 mv e g 50 or 100 mv above the baseline level caused adverse effects on reactor performance likely due to excess aerobic respiration by facultative heterotrophs khanal and huang 2003a b 2006 4 discussion our results suggest that orp controlled intermittent micro aeration promoted vfa conversion by facultative bacteria while conserving crucial anaerobic niches for methanogenesis allowing stable operation of ad reactors at high olr combining reactor performance results mass balance analyses microbial community characterization data and bioenergetics evaluations we propose a putative methane producing pathway for complex substrates such as lignocellulosic biomass at high olr under intermittent orp controlled micro aerobic conditions as illustrated in fig 6 however further metatranscriptomic analyses are needed to evaluate the specific transcriptional activities in this complex microbial community to confirm the proposed pathway this novel operational strategy via micro aeration can be further developed and applied to operate anaerobic digesters at high olrs this approach avoids chemical addition for ph control and has significant merits for full scale implementation of anaerobic digestion of highly complex substrates such as lignocellulosic based feedstocks 5 conclusions orp based micro aeration was developed and tested for ad of highly complex feedstocks such as lignocellulosic biomass at high olr by increasing the olr to 5 0 g vs l day a proportional increase in total vfa concentration and a vfa alk ratio that caused reduction in ph and methane yield were observed driving the reactor to the verge of failure when intermittent orp controlled micro aeration was initiated vfa concentrations rapidly decreased and the reactor performance recovered within two weeks controlling the orp at 470 mv i e 25 mv from the anaerobic baseline orp resulted in optimal vfa reduction the orp based micro aeration provided o2 as the limiting electron acceptor for facultative heterotrophs allowing partial aerobic oxidation of vfa while conserving crucial anaerobic niches for methanogens thus orp based micro aeration serves as a novel process control tool for highly loaded ad systems especially when digester are on the verge of failure due to excess vfa accumulation

18482,this study developed an intermittent oxidation reduction potential orp controlled micro aeration system for high solids anaerobic digestion ad of lignocellulosic biomass without volatile fatty acids vfa accumulation at high organic loading rate olr traditional ad of napier grass a model lignocellulosic biomass at an olr of 5 g volatile solids vs l day resulted in an accumulation of total vfa concentration up to 9 2 g l as acetic acid hac equivalent causing rapid drops in ph and methane yield and driving the digester to the verge of failure once intermittent every 24 h orp controlled micro aeration at orp of 470 mv was initiated the total vfa concentration rapidly decreased to 3 0 g hac l and the methane yield improved resulting in stable digester performance without the need for alkalinity supplementation or olr reduction by combining reactor performance results mass balance analyses microbial community characterization data and a bioenergetic evaluation this study suggested that rapid vfa conversion and ch4 production were carried out by facultative anaerobes and hydrogenotrophic methanogens under micro aerobic conditions this novel operating approach can be applied as an effective control strategy for high olr ad processes especially in the event of vfa accumulation graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion vfa accumulation micro aeration oxidation reduction potential orp microbial community metabolic pathway 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad has received increased attention in recent years due to several inherent merits including its ability to produce renewable energy from diverse organic materials remediate waste streams and curtail greenhouse gas emissions surendra et al 2015 limitations of the ad process however are rooted in the intrinsic difficulty of maintaining a balance among the activities of hydrolytic acidogenic acetogenic and methanogenic microorganisms slow digestibility especially when fed with recalcitrant substrates such as lignocellulosic biomass is the main reason for low methane yield sawatdeenarunat et al 2015 to overcome this limitation digesters are commonly operated at high organic loading rates olrs using feedstocks with a high total solids ts content however at high olrs digesters are susceptible to failure due to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfa mainly acetic propionic and butyric acids caused by an imbalance between syntrophic acetogenic bacteria and methanogens boe and angelidaki 2012 ward et al 2008 this syntrophic relationship is extremely sensitive since the hydrogen partial pressure ph2 has to be low enough for the anaerobic degradation of vfa to be thermodynamically favorable but high enough for the consumption by h2 utilizing methanogens dolfing 2014 labib et al 1993 failure to maintain this delicate balance leads to ad process failure due to vfa build up and may require restarting of the digester thereby causing significant economic loss dong et al 2011 steyer et al 2006 hence there is a critical need to develop effective control strategies to maintain stability and rapid recovery of ad processes from potential failure with simultaneous enhancement of hydrolysis vfa utilization and methane production to this end we developed a unique approach of improving digester stability by intermittently injecting small amount of oxygen micro aeration the timing of which is controlled by oxidation reduction potential orp traditionally oxygen or air exposure is avoided in ad systems to minimize its negative impact on anaerobic microorganisms however methanogenesis was recently found to occur outside of anaerobic environments as well such as in oxygenated freshwater and soil angle et al 2017 recent studies have also shown that micro aeration in anaerobic processes can enhance hydrolysis rate methane yield vfa production and hydrogen sulfide removal nguyen and khanal 2018 the underlying rationale for the beneficial effects of micro aeration on ad processes is the augmentation in diversity and activity of facultative bacteria that promote hydrolysis fermentation and sulfide oxidation krayzelova et al 2015 lim et al 2013 zhu et al 2009 based on the above reasoning we hypothesized that vfa accumulated in the digesters during overload conditions would be rapidly consumed by facultative heterotrophs under micro aerobic conditions thus contributing to ad process stability to use micro aeration as an effective operational strategy in ad precise oxygen dosing control is needed to prevent overdosing and inhibition of anaerobic metabolisms very limited studies have focused on an effective micro aeration dosing system that can be applied in the ad processes nguyen and khanal 2018 oxidation reduction potential orp or redox potential which exhibits a logarithmic relationship with dissolved oxygen concentration fig s1 can be used for precise oxygen dosing control during micro aeration this approach was previously applied in biological hydrogen sulfide removal khanal and huang 2003a b and in pure culture fermentation processes to augment the product yield liu et al 2013 however insights into the effects of orp controlled micro aeration on metabolic pathways and synergistic interactions between aerobic anaerobic and bacterial archaeal populations in ad process are still lacking the overall goal of this study was to develop and validate the performance of an orp based micro aeration system to prevent vfa accumulation without the inhibition of methanogenesis during ad of lignocellulosic feedstock at high olr after investigating the effects of increasing olr on ad performance orp based micro aeration was initiated to examine for ad process stability control by combining reactor performance and microbial community analyses with bioenergetics and mass balance calculations we provide new insights into the dynamics of orp controlled micro aeration in ad process and present an effective strategy for maintaining the stability of a highly loaded ad system 2 materials and methods 2 1 feedstock and inoculum napier grass pennisetum purpureum 5 months old a typical energy crop

shredder vincent corporation tampa fl usa and was air dried until the moisture content reached 15 for stable storage at room temperature the dried biomass was then passed through a cutting mill retch sm 2000 haan germany with a screen size of 2 mm the milled biomass was stored in vacuum bags at room temperature and was used as the sole feedstock for the entire research period cattle manure derived inoculum maintained in a 20 l inoculum reactor at mesophilic condition was used to start up an anaerobic reactor the inoculum reactor had been fed with fresh cattle manure for 40 days and the

of the reactor in replicate 1 is primarily discussed in the main manuscript and the results from replicates 2 and 3 are given in appendix a the bioreactor in replicate 1 was operated anaerobically at olrs of 1 5 3 0 and 5 0 g vs l day from days 1 30 42 60 and 75 116 respectively table s6 between each of these three operating periods the olr was increased in a step wise increment of 0 5 g vs l day till stable performance a quasi steady state was achieved no significant difference anova p 0 05 in each monitoring parameter during five consecutive days of operation in this study the term stable with above definition is used instead of quasi steady state for brevity alkalinity was periodically supplemented by adding nahco3 mainly under anaerobic conditions at high olr to maintain the ph above 6 0 the reactor was operated in a semi continuous mode by daily withdrawal of digestate followed by feeding a mixture of biomass napier grass and distilled water to maintain desired olrs and constant hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days orp based micro aeration was initiated on day 117 in replicate 1 at olr 5 0 g vs l day when the bioreactor showed signs of instability and the performance of this bioreactor was further divided into four periods for comparison namely 5 0 stable days 75 94 anaerobic condition before rapid vfa accumulation 5 0 unstable days 95 116 anaerobic condition with rapid vfa accumulation ph drop and low methane yield regardless of alkalinity additions 5 0 micro aerobic days 117 155 intermittent micro aeration condition 5 0 anaerobic after micro aeration days 156 242 anaerobic condition after stopping the micro aeration system 2 3 orp based micro aeration system orp which is highly sensitive to oxygen fig s1 was selected as the parameter to control micro

airgas hi usa was finely adjusted at 1 ml min using a two staged low pressure regulator and a needle valve a digital timer was used to automatically monitor the total micro aeration time in seconds the reactor was subjected to micro aeration every other day fig s2 the micro aeration intensity l o2 l reactor day was calculated by multiplying the oxygen flow rate with the daily micro aeration time and divided by the reactor working volume details of the orp controlled micro aeration system are provided in appendix a 2 4 chemical analyses ph orp and methane yield were monitored daily individual vfa and vfa alk ratio were analysed every two days ts vs and fiber compositions were analysed weekly details of the chemical analyses are provided in appendix a 2 5 microbial analyses biomass samples under anaerobic and micro aerobic conditions were collected from the bioreactor in replicate 1 on days 79 and 149 replicate 2 on days 150 and 192 and replicate 3 on days 64 and 108 respectively when the olr was 5 g vs l day the collected biomass samples were subjected to dna extraction using the power soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc canada as per the manufacturer s instructions the bacterial and methanogenic communities were investigated by targeting the 16s rrna gene using 515f 806r primers and the mcra gene using mcra3f mcra3r primers respectively caporaso et al 2012 luton et al 2002 sequencing was performed using the illumina hiseq2000 platform and sequence reads were processed using mothur version 1 35 0 schloss et al 2009 chimeras were removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 bacterial 16s rrna gene fragments were aligned against the silva database release 123 pruesse et al 2007 and mcra gene fragments against a subset of the fun gene database fish et al 2013 resulting in taxonomic labels for each aligned fragment the raw sequence reads were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive sra http www ncbi nlm nih gov sra under accession numbers samn12752316

to compare differences among various bioreactor operating conditions table 1 all statistical analyses were carried out using jmp software jmp pro version 12 0 sas institute inc nc usa with p value of

propionate and butyrate vfa alk ratio and ts content in the reactor with concomitant decreases in methane yield ph and vs removal efficiency stable operation was achieved at olrs of 1 5 and 3 0 g vs l day with an average methane yield of 102 105 4 nml g vs added which was comparable to other studies using the same substrate sawatdeenarunat et al 2015 surendra and khanal 2014 when the olr was increased to 5 0 g vs l day the reactor performance began to deteriorate table 1 in replicate 1 the bioreactor operating at an olr of 5 0 g vs l day from day 75 showed a rapid accumulation of vfas fig 2 b and c which led to decreases in ph and methane yield fig 2a and b the bioreactor was particularly unstable from days 95 116 as the total vfa had increased to 9 0 g acetic acid equivalent hac l the vfa alk ratio was 2 0 and the ph had dropped to 5 5 resulting in a reduction in the methane yield to as low as 5 0 nml g vs regardless of attempts to stabilize the bioreactor through alkalinity supplementations fig 2a the results demonstrated that mono digestion of napier grass under mesophilic conditions started to experience organic overloading at olr 5 0 g vs l day to overcome this limitation the effectiveness of intermittent orp controlled micro aeration 24 h every other day to obtain stable bioreactor performance under high olr was examined 3 2 bioreactor performance with intermittent orp controlled micro aeration at olr of 5 0 g vs l day the intermittent orp controlled micro aeration operation was started on day 117 in replicate 1 fig 2 within 12 days the total vfa concentration decreased from 9 2 to 3 0 g hac l and the acetic acid concentration dropped from 4 0 g l to less than 0 7 g l fig 2c with a concomitant increase in methane yield from 40 to 114 nml g vs fig 2b all other important parameters stabilized as well fig 2 suggesting full recovery of the bioreactor stable operation of the bioreactor at high olr continued even under anaerobic conditions from days 156 215 after intermittent micro aeration was terminated however from days 215 242 the gradual accumulation of vfa was observed likely leading to another unstable period under anaerobic condition replicates 2 and 3 confirmed the effectiveness of orp controlled micro aeration on digester stability the recovery trends in replicates 2 and 3 figs s3 and s4 were similar to those in replicate 1 for example a drop in the total vfa level from 10 8 to 5 0 g hac l and from 9 2 to 2 1 g hac l with concomitant increase in methane yields from 5 to 102 nml g vs and from 21 to 125 nml g vs were observed after micro aeration was initiated in replicates 2 and 3 respectively figs s3 and s4 these replicate experiments confirmed the effectiveness of intermittent micro aeration to control vfa accumulation and to maintain bioreactor stability the average values of important performance parameters for the three replicates are summarized in table 1 intermittent micro aeration was achieved by controlling the orp at a setpoint of 470 mv 25 mv above the anaerobic baseline orp of 495 mv fig 2e for a 24 h period followed by a 24 h period without micro aeration the orp levels varied from an average of 468 4 mv to an average of 522 12 mv during the days with and without micro aeration respectively indicating a rapid exhaustion of residual dissolved oxygen do and a switching back to anaerobic conditions also the average daily orp of the anaerobic period after micro aeration days 156 242 remained fairly stable at a baseline orp level of 530 9 mv fig 2e the orp levels during anaerobic and micro aerobic conditions were in close agreement with those in previous studies jenicek et al 2011 khanal and huang 2006 thus intermittent orp based micro aeration was instrumental in digester recovery from the verge of failure without supplementation of alkalinity and or reducing the olr 3 3 micro aeration enhanced carbon recovery the results of a carbon mass balance performed before and after micro aeration in three replicate experiments fig 3 indicate that micro aerobic conditions enhanced lignocellulosic degradation and carbon recovery in the form of biogas co2 and ch4 production specifically the digestate from the micro aerated condition consisted of 2 84 0 13 g carbon which was significantly lower p 0 05 than 3 66 0 13 g carbon present in the digestate without micro aeration this finding was further supported by a significant increase p 0 05 in vs reduction from 20 6 2 7 during the anaerobic unstable period to 47 3 2 7 after micro aeration was initiated table 1 this increase in substrate degradation resulted in higher soluble substrate concentrations for microbial communities and therefore significantly improved biogas production and enhanced carbon recovery in the form of co2 and ch4 in addition the removal of accumulated vfa stabilized the ph of the bioreactor and facilitated the quick recovery of the activity of methanogens thereby resulting in significant enhancement in ch4 production p 0 05 however the carbon mass balance in this study could not identify the fractions of carbon that went into each pathway within the ad process aerobic respiration or anaerobic syntrophic acetogenesis acetoclastic or hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis such information could only be obtained from carbon isotope labelling techniques gehring et al 2015 which was beyond the scope of this study 3 4 micro aeration promoted vfa conversion by facultative bacteria through aerobic respiration in traditional ad process the syntrophic interaction between acetogens and methanogens is critically important to maintain low vfa concentrations in the aqueous phase leng et al 2017a yuan et al 2011 however due to thermodynamic limitation of syntrophic acetogenic reactions leng et al 2017b this rate limiting step in ad process often causes vfa build up and leads to reactor failure as is the case in this study this study suggested a dominant mechanism of effective vfa conversion by facultative bacteria and methane production by hydrogenotrophic methanogens under controlled micro aerobic conditions the suggestion is based on mass balance analyses thermodynamic calculation and the three observations drawn from the microbial community analysis 1 the relative abundance of syntrophic bacteria remained low 1 0 of total bacteria 2 the relative abundance of facultative bacteria increased after orp based micro aeration and 3 methanogenesis was achieved mainly by hydrogenotrophic methanogens these observations are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraph the high olr of 5 0 g vs l day resulted in vfa accumulation and drops in ph and methane production table 1 suggesting a microbial imbalance before micro aeration was initiated the microbial analyses confirmed that syntrophic bacteria family syntrophaceae and syntrophomonadaceae were present at low relative abundances under anaerobic condition as their combined relative abundance accounted for less than 1 0 of total bacteria in all three replicate experiments table s2 similar microbial results were reported for ad systems subjected to stress or high vfa concentrations feng et al 2009 goux et al 2015 luo et al 2016 treu et al 2016 the relative abundance of these syntrophic acetogens remained below 1 0 table s2 after implementing micro aeration at the same time there was a significant increase in relative abundance of facultative bacteria fig 4 especially the most abundant operational taxonomy units otus associated with the genus proteiniphilum chen and dong 2005 increased from 16 to 32 following micro aeration the increase in these otus was even more distinct in replicates 2 from 2 to 65 and 3 from 1 to 43 table s2 indicating that proteiniphilum spp played an important role in converting excess vfa into co2 during intermittent orp based micro aeration in ad process additionally the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was observed in all samples obtained during micro aeration for all three replicate experiments suggesting that the increase in methane production was associated with co2 generated during the preceding aerobic respiration reactions to further reinforce the findings suggested by the microbial community analyses thermodynamic calculations were performed fig 5 thermodynamic results show that the changes in gibbs free energy associated with complete vfa oxidation to co2 using o2 as an electron acceptor δg r 91 7 to 88 2 kj e were much higher than that of incomplete vfa fermentation coupled with proton reduction δg r 11 1 to 6 9 kj e at the actual conditions of replicate 1 fig 5 these thermodynamic values at the actual conditions are also more conservative compared to values at standard conditions where vfa aerobic oxidation reactions are even more thermodynamically favorable δgo 109 kj e than those for the vfa anaerobic fermentation reactions δgo 1 to 23 kj e table s3 these results suggest that the facultative bacteria switched from anaerobic fermentation to the more thermodynamically and kinetically favorable aerobic respiration tables s3 and s4 upon the dosing of o2 for the facultative bacteria the more energetically favorable aerobic respiration could be regulated via specific gene expression forster and gescher 2014 morris and schmidt 2013 thus the vfa produced during the period without micro aeration were likely consumed by the facultative heterotrophs when micro aeration was initiated resulting in low vfa concentrations during the period with intermittent micro aeration fig 2 this increases in relative abundance of facultative bacteria while preserving methanogens for a more balanced digestion with a long lasting effect even after the micro aeration was terminated it therefore triggered the stable operation of the reactor under anaerobic condition from days 156 242 fig 2 moreover after the build up of vfa was reduced to the baseline level around 3 g l as hac via orp based micro aeration the reactor could be operated at anaerobic condition without micro aeration control for a long period through the newly established microbial community fig s6 nonetheless the duration in which the reactor could be operated anaerobically without micro aeration varied e g the stable period after stopping micro aeration in replicate 3 was relatively short fig s4 possibly due to ecologically dynamic responses axelrod and hamilton 1981 hence this intermittent micro aeration system had two purposes the first was to provide the precise amount of o2 for facultative heterotrophs to rapidly consume the accumulated vfa during unstable periods and the second was to develop a new balanced microbial community for long term stable methane production at high olrs while alkalinity addition for ph control only caused transient relief of vfa inhibition to methanogens the intermittent micro aeration system effectively scavenged excess vfa thereby maintaining digester stability during high organic loading conditions 3 5 orp controlled micro aeration maintained anaerobic niches for methanogenesis although intermittent orp based micro aeration created micro aerobic niches for vfa conversion by facultative microbes it preserved the crucial methanogens as apparent from the increased methane production figs 2 and 3 indicating a vibrant methanogenic activity even though the accumulated vfa were likely oxidized to co2 through aerobic respiration during micro aeration there was no significant change p 0 05 in the co2 content of the biogas suggesting that co2 was reduced to ch4 using h2 as an electron donor this was further supported by the finding that the most abundant methanogenic populations under intermittent micro aeration conditions were all hydrogenotrophic methanogens table s2 in replicate 1 due to the abundance of the metabolically versatile genus methanosarcina ch4 production via h2 or acetate de vrieze et al 2012 a flexible metabolic switch from acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis may have occurred during micro aeration without population succession fig 4 in replicates 2 and 3 the strictly hydrogenotrophic methanogens belonging to the genera methanobrevibacter leadbetter and breznak 1996 and methanocorpusculum gilmore et al 2017 dominated under micro aerobic conditions confirming that orp based micro aeration favoured hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis over acetoclastic methanogenesis table s2 methanogenic genera methanosarcina and methanobrevibacter are known to possess oxygen detoxifying enzymes such as superoxide dismutase sod catalase and peroxidase which might be responsible for oxygen tolerance in micro aeration conditions nguyen and khanal 2018 moreover although h2 oxidation with o2 to h2o δg r 92 7 kj e is thermodynamically more favorable than h2 reduction to ch4 δg r 4 0 kj e the supplied o2 was likely completely consumed during vfa oxidation thereby leaving the available h2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogens here the fast growing facultative heterotrophs μm 13 2 1 day appeared to have an advantage in the presence of excess vfa over slow growing h2 oxidizing bacteria μm 10 1 1 day with limited h2 availability and with similar gibbs free energy changes for aerobic oxidation of vfa and h2 δg r 88 2 to 92 7 kj e tables s3 and s4 consistent with this the otus associated with facultative heterotrophs accounted for more than 30 of the total bacteria while h2 oxidizing bacteria were not detected among the dominant otus table s2 as shown in fig 2 the reduction of h2 to an undetectable level in the biogas occurred after day 140 when the total vfa concentration was as low as 3 0 g hac l this could be due to aerobic oxidation of h2 to h2o whereas prior to day 140 all supplied o2 was likely consumed by facultative heterotrophs to oxidize accumulated vfa to co2 our results suggest that intermittent micro aeration by controlling orp level at 470 mv was insufficient to fully support aerobic growth thus facilitating anaerobic metabolism for methanogens in such micro aerobic environment further in an independent set of experiments it was observed that continuous micro aeration at an orp 25 mv higher than the baseline orp and intermittent micro aeration at an orp 50 mv higher than the baseline orp caused significant accumulation of vfa due to inhibition of methanogens as indicated by reduced methane yields table s5 the higher oxidative micro environment was unfavourable to support the co existence of facultative bacteria and anaerobic methanogens liu et al 2013 other studies have also reported that micro aeration at an orp greater than 25 mv e g 50 or 100 mv above the baseline level caused adverse effects on reactor performance likely due to excess aerobic respiration by facultative heterotrophs khanal and huang 2003a b 2006 4 discussion our results suggest that orp controlled intermittent micro aeration promoted vfa conversion by facultative bacteria while conserving crucial anaerobic niches for methanogenesis allowing stable operation of ad reactors at high olr combining reactor performance results mass balance analyses microbial community characterization data and bioenergetics evaluations we propose a putative methane producing pathway for complex substrates such as lignocellulosic biomass at high olr under intermittent orp controlled micro aerobic conditions as illustrated in fig 6 however further metatranscriptomic analyses are needed to evaluate the specific transcriptional activities in this complex microbial community to confirm the proposed pathway this novel operational strategy via micro aeration can be further developed and applied to operate anaerobic digesters at high olrs this approach avoids chemical addition for ph control and has significant merits for full scale implementation of anaerobic digestion of highly complex substrates such as lignocellulosic based feedstocks 5 conclusions orp based micro aeration was developed and tested for ad of highly complex feedstocks such as lignocellulosic biomass at high olr by increasing the olr to 5 0 g vs l day a proportional increase in total vfa concentration and a vfa alk ratio that caused reduction in ph and methane yield were observed driving the reactor to the verge of failure when intermittent orp controlled micro aeration was initiated vfa concentrations rapidly decreased and the reactor performance recovered within two weeks controlling the orp at 470 mv i e 25 mv from the anaerobic baseline orp resulted in optimal vfa reduction the orp based micro aeration provided o2 as the limiting electron acceptor for facultative heterotrophs allowing partial aerobic oxidation of vfa while conserving crucial anaerobic niches for methanogens thus orp based micro aeration serves as a novel process control tool for highly loaded ad systems especially when digester are on the verge of failure due to excess vfa accumulation

18483,calcification and deactivation of high rate sludge bed reactors is a common and serious engineering problem in the application of anaerobic bioreactor in this study the characteristics and deactivation mechanism of calcified anaerobic granules were investigated the results showed that the calcium content of calcified anaerobic granules was ten times higher than that of control anaerobic granules a large part of the calcium accumulated in the center of anaerobic granules in the form of calcite and a small part of the calcium distributed in the outer layer of anaerobic granules in the form of ca p deposit the calcium core occupied a large space which was available for the functional microorganisms the calcium salts deposited in the outer layer of granular sludge which led to the significant reduction of macropore volume the porosity of calcified anaerobic granules decreased by 13 compared with that of control anaerobic granules causing generally the decline of methanogenic activity for example by 13 at influent organic concentration of 6 6 g cod l 1 the substrate gradient created by methanation of organic salts including organic calcium salts was deduced to be the

also the liquid and gas channel for mass transfer afridi et al 2018 davit et al 2013 according to the ministry of ecology and environment of china ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china 2017 chemical oxygen demand cod ranks first among the pollutants of wastewater the wastewater of paper industry is huge and its cod discharge accounts for a very important part in the industrial wastewaters the wastewater of paper mills generally contains calcium kim et al 2004 which is an essential nutrient of microorganisms and plays an irreplaceable role in maintaining cell structure and promoting physiological activities madigan et al 2012 calcium can also promote the sludge granulation by bridging the eps of cells lu et al 2015 however the high calcium concentration affects the granule structure and interferes with the physiological function dang et al 2014 langerak et al 2000 each anaerobic granule has a certain volume in which cell eps and pore occupy a specific proportion respectively due to the microbial metabolism an increased ph profile is existing in the anaerobic granule promote the precipitation of calcium salts in the core of granules kim et al 2004 cunha et al 2018b that effect was affected by operational conditions of bioreactors cunha et al 2018a feldman et al 2019 the calcium salts occupy the space that is available for the cell colonization reduce the density of functional microorganism and decrease in activity per volume due to dilution of biomass batstone et al 2002 van langerak et al 1998 on the other hand the high calcium concentration in the wastewater could alter the granule structure studies have shown that granules cultured in wastewater with high calcium content has larger particle size ren et al 2008 jiang et al 2003 meanwhile calcium salts deposited in the outer layer may block the pores of the granule cunha et al 2018b two types of granule structure variation will lead to the increase of mass transfer resistance of granular sludge afridi et al 2018 wu et al 2016 and eventually leads to the inactivation of functional microorganisms with the granular sludge from the laboratory reactors the aim of this work was to determine the distribution pattern of calcium salts in calcified anaerobic granules investigate the variation in physical and chemical properties of granular sludge caused by calcification and analyze the deactivation mechanism of calcified anaerobic granular sludge providing a reference for eventually solving the problem of anaerobic treatment of organic wastewaters with

anaerobic granule was 0 895 and the ash tss was 0 105 the chemical analysis indicated that the calcium content of calcified anaerobic granule was 234 49 mg g tss while that of control anaerobic granule was 21 73 mg g tss fig 2 a the calcium content of calcified granular sludge was 9 79 times higher than the counterpart p 0 01 single tailed t test the precipitation of calcium ion is closely related to anions the chemical analysis indicated that the phosphorus content by tss of calcified anaerobic granule was 1 90 mg g tss while that of control anaerobic granule was 2 53 mg g tss fig 2b the phosphorus content of calcified anaerobic granule was lower than the counterpart significantly p 0 01 single tail t test out of our expectation the phosphorus content of calcified anaerobic

compared with the control granules no significant difference was observed for the small pore distribution pore diameter 10 μm but a great difference was found for the macropore distribution pore diameter 10 μm in calcified anaerobic granules in addition the overall porosity of calcified granules was also 13 lower than the counterpart the size distribution of anaerobic granule was determined quantitatively which was shown in fig s2 it has been acknowledged that the lower limit size of granular sludge was defined as 0 2 mm de kreuk et al 2007 the size range of anaerobic granule was 0 4743 μm based on the average size the anaerobic granules could be divided into 6 groups floc 200 μm fine granule 200 1000 μm small granule 1000 2000 μm medium granule 2000 3000 μm coarse granule 3000 4000

coarse granule was 3 9 28 5 34 6 23 7 and 9 1 respectively the vmd of calcified anaerobic granules was 2573 μm in average by contrast among the control anaerobic granules the percentage of floc was only 0 2 the percentage of fine granule small granule medium granule coarse granule and extra coarse granule was 3 0 11 6 40 1 35 2 and 9 9 respectively the vmd of control anaerobic granules was 2878 μm in average the difference of size distribution was not so large between the calcified anaerobic granules and the control anaerobic granules and only the percentage of small granule of calcified anaerobic granules was higher than the counterpart significantly 16 86 p 0 01 double tailed t test no significant difference of vmd was observed either between the calcified anaerobic granules and the counterpart p 0 09 double tailed t test 3 2 the form and distribution of calcium in anaerobic granule x ray diffraction xrd analysis is an efficient tool to distinguish the crystalline structure from the amorphous structure mañas et al 2011 the calcium core of calcified anaerobic granule was analyzed using xrd to determine the main form of calcium salt and its diffractogram was shown in fig 3 by peak search and phase retrieval jade 5 obvious diffraction peaks were observed when 2θ was at 23 08 29 43 36 02 39 45 43 20 47 52 and 48 54 among which 2θ 29 34 was the major peak by comparison with reference spectra all the peaks including the biggest one coincided with those of calcite caco3 jcpds no 05 0586 indicating that calcite was the main form of calcium core the crystallinity of calcite in calcium core was 92 91 proving that the crystallization was almost complete the distribution of inorganic crystals in the anaerobic granules were analyzed using x ray computed tomography the results were shown in fig 4 and fig s3 the brighter regions in the atlas were associated with the relatively high density material i e inorganic crystal which demonstrated the higher intensity in the shadow image conversely the darker regions corresponded to the relatively low density material i e air space a lot of inorganic crystals was observed in the calcified anaerobic granules which were mainly distributed in the center meanwhile some inorganic crystals of about 100 μm were embedded in the organic matters of outer layer fig 4 by contrast only a few inorganic crystals of several hundred microns was seen in the control anaerobic granules which were randomly distributed inside the granule fig s3 the inorganic crystals in the calcified anaerobic granules were far more than those in the control anaerobic granules sem coupled with eds were conducted to determine the distribution and elemental composition of calcium salt in the calcified anaerobic granules and the typical images were shown in fig 5 a lot of plate crystal clusters were observed in the outer layer whose size was in the range of 10 100 μm fig 5a and b eds analyses indicated that the outer crystal clusters were mainly composed of o c ca and p and the atomic ratio was about 5 07 1 01 1 0 97 table s2 on the surface of calcium core distributed the prismatic crystals fig 5c and d which were mainly composed of three elements o c and ca with the atomic ratio about 4 73 3 64 1 table s2 because of the interference of organic matter near the crystal with the scanning of sem eds the atomic proportion of c o in this study was higher than that of standard calcium salts e g cahpo4 ca p o 1 1 4 caco3 ca c o 1 1 3 3 3 methanogenic activity of calcified anaerobic granule methane production is one of the main functions of anaerobic granule the methanogenic activity of calcified anaerobic granule was determined using batch tests and the results were shown in fig 6 the influent cod concentration of ic reactor in paper mills was about 6 6 g cod l 1 at this cod concentration the sma of calcified anaerobic granule was 32 54 ml g vss h while the corresponding value of control anaerobic granule was 31 53 ml g vss h the above activity rates were within the range found in existing literature and close to the upper limit cunha et al 2018b schmidt and ahring 1996 in addition at this inlet concentration 6 6 g cod l 1 no significant difference of sma was observed between the calcified anaerobic granule and the control anaerobic granule p 0 33 single tailed t test the specific volume methanogenic activity svma of calcified anaerobic granule was 3 52 ml ml h while the corresponding value of control anaerobic granule was 4 05 ml ml h indicating that the svma of calcified anaerobic granule was significantly lower than the counterpart 13 1 p 0 03 single tailed t test the relationship between sma and cod was fitted by monod equation and the results were shown in fig 6 and eq 2 5 the sma max and svma max of calcified anaerobic granule were 69 42 ml g vss h and 7 52 ml ml h while the corresponding values of control granular sludge were 45 87 ml g vss h and 5 89 ml ml h the sma max and svma max of calcified anaerobic granule were 0 51 and 0 28 times higher than those of control anaerobic granule respectively it indicated that the calcification of anaerobic granule did not reduce the methanogenic potential the k s of calcified anaerobic granule was 8 95 g cod l while the corresponding value of control anaerobic granule was 3 57 g cod l the k s of calcified anaerobic granule was 2 51 times as high as the counterpart when the svma of calcified anaerobic granule reached a half of svma max of control anaerobic granule the cod was 5 90 g l which was 0 65 times higher than the k s of control anaerobic granule above all the substrate affinity of calcified anaerobic granule was obviously lower than that of control anaerobic granule 2 s m a n o m l g v s s h 45 87 c o d 3 57 c o d

abundance and activity of calcified anaerobic granule the abundance and activity of methanogenic cells were characterized using qpcr and rt qpcr as shown in fig 7 the specific biomass and specific volume mcra gene abundance of calcified anaerobic granule were 1 67 1010 copies g vss and 1 80 109 copies ml in average while those of control anaerobic granule were 3 92 109 copies g vss and 5 04 108 copies ml to our surprise the specific biomass and specific volume mcra gene abundance of calcified anaerobic granule were significantly higher than the counterpart p 0 01 double tailed t test indicating that the abundance of methanogenic cells in the calcified anaerobic granule was higher than that in the control anaerobic granule the higher abundance of methanogenic cells was consistent with the higher methanogenic potential of calcified anaerobic granule in the experiment of methanogenic kinetics the specific biomass and specific volume mcra gene transcription level of calcified anaerobic granule was 4 83 108 copies g vss and 6 20 107 copies ml in average while those of control anaerobic granule were 3 92 109 copies g vss and 5 04 108 copies ml the specific biomass and specific volume mcra gene transcription level of calcified anaerobic granule was significantly lower than the counterpart p 0 01 and p 0 04 respectively double tailed t test indicating that the activity of methanogen in the calcified anaerobic granule was lower than that in the control anaerobic granule 4 discussion 4 1 the coverage of calcium salts on the surface pore blockage microbial community is the main factor determining the active potential of anaerobic granules the results of qpcr shown that the abundance of methanogenic cells in the calcified anaerobic granules was higher than that in the control anaerobic granules it can be concluded that the different methanogenic activity between calcified granule and control granule at low cod concentration is not caused by the different species or quantity of functional microbe in anaerobic bioreactor pollutants are uptake and converted by functional microorganisms after they enter the anaerobic granule through the pores it is reported that the mass transfer is the rate limiting step in the decomposition of organic pollutants by the anaerobic granules al rubaye et al 2018 ghorbanian et al 2014 a good pore structure is an important guarantee for the metabolic activity of anaerobic granules without the liquid flow the solute or substrate is mainly transported into the anaerobic granules by diffusion davit et al 2013 mu et al 2006 according to the solute transfer model of anaerobic granules afridi et al 2018 wu et al 2016 the molecular diffusion flux is proportional to the granule porosity in the larger pore substrate can be transported by seepage for example stoodley et al 1994 recorded the liquid flow in the ten micron scale pore of biofilm using superimposed time sequence image the pore size of anaerobic granule ranged from 0 3 nm to 91 μm which could be divided into capillary pore the diameter is 0 1 μm 1 mm whose volume was dominant in the anaerobic granule and ultracapillary pore the diameter is less than 0 1 μm which is filled with bound water and is ineffective for mass transfer huang and li 2012 xu et al 2019 the capillary pores are important for the mass transfer of granules but the importance varies with pore sizes according to hu 2018 the most probable pore size of anammox granule ranges from 10 μm to 29 μm in the study of wu et al 2016 there are volume peaks when the pore diameter was around 10 μm in the pore volume diagram of large granules and these volume peaks were absent in the pore volume diagrams of small and medium granules the large granules were thought to possess a better mass transfer ability than the small and medium granules in this research pore structure of control was in line with previous studies however pores with a diameter lager than 10 μm which could be defined as good pores was rare in calcified anaerobic granules the seepage in capillary pores follows darcy s law v kj v seepage rate k permeability coefficient j hydraulic gradient the seepage rate is proportional to the permeability coefficient and the latter is positively related to the pore diameter li 2004 in conclusion the macropore of anaerobic granules which was rare in calcified anaerobic granules is an important channel for the mass transfer as shown in fig 2c no obvious difference of small pore distribution pore diameter 10 μm was observed between the calcified anaerobic granules and control anaerobic granules but a large difference of macropore distribution pore diameter 10 μm was found between the two anaerobic granules the porosity and average pore diameter of calcified anaerobic granules were significantly smaller than the counterpart which were 87 and 74 of control granular sludge respectively table s3 the sem observation showed that a lot of ca p crystal clusters distributed in the outer layer of calcified anaerobic granules whose size was in the range of macropore 10 100 μm these calcium deposits in the outer layer of anaerobic granules is speculated to block the macropore leading to the deterioration of mass transfer this speculation received a strong support from the methanogenic kinetics of anaerobic granules the half saturation constant of calcified anaerobic granules was obviously larger than that of control anaerobic granules indicating a lager mass transfer resistance of calcified anaerobic granules baeten et al 2018 fox and suidan 1990 in the experiment of methanogenic activity cod 6 6 g cod l 1 the svma of calcified anaerobic granules was 13 1 lower than that of control anaerobic granules which confirmed the decrease of porosity 13 and coincided with the calculated value based on the model reported by afridi et al afridi et al 2018 wu et al 2016 eq 6 despite the higher methanogenic potential the blockage of ca p crystal clusters caused a significant decline of svma 6 f m d 4 π r 2 d m c 0 ε ϕ where f m d was the molecular diffusion rate r was the radius of anaerobic granule d m was the diffusivity of substrate c 0 was the substrate concentration in the bulk solution ε was dimensionless porosity and was the assumed diffusion layer from the surface into the center of granule in this study the difference of granule size between the two anaerobic granules could be neglected when the substrate concentration of medium is determined the molecular diffusion rate into the surface of anaerobic granule was proportional to the porosity of anaerobic granule 4 2 the deposit of calcium salts in the granule space occupation the anaerobic microbial cells firstly assemble into aggregates with the help of eps and divalent cation hulshoff pol et al 2004 and then form the anaerobic granule to endow the bioreactor with the function of pollutant transformation ca2 is an essential nutrient for anaerobic microorganisms madigan et al 2012 and it is also an accelerating agent of sludge granulation lu et al 2015 wan et al 2015 however the excessive accumulation of calcium salt in the anaerobic granule will occupy the space that is supposed to be available for functional microorganisms leading to the decrease of cell density and metabolic activity in anaerobic granules the specific biomass and specific volume mcra gene abundance of calcified anaerobic granules were significantly higher than those of control anaerobic granules while the specific biomass and specific volume mcra gene transcription level of calcified anaerobic granules was significantly lower than the counterpart indicating that the methanogenic activity of calcified anaerobic granules decreased although the methanogenic potential was high the calcified anaerobic granules were taken from an ic reactor of paper mill whose influent cod concentration fluctuated largely and whose methanogenic redundancy was high in anaerobic granules although a large amount of calcium salts total calcium content 23 by dry weight deposited in the calcified anaerobic granules some granules have a calcium nuclei with the diameter more than 1 mm the current ash content did not significantly reduce the methanogenic potential of anaerobic granules the accumulation of ash in anaerobic granules is a gradual process during the treatment of organic wastewaters with high calcium batstone et al 2002 in order to characterize the effect of calcium core on the activity of calcified anaerobic granules the relationship between svma and ash content of calcified anaerobic granules based on the metabolic kinetics of calcified anaerobic granules sma max ks was established with the influent cod concentration for the ic reactor in paper mill eq 7 fig 8 with the elevation of ash content the svma of anaerobic granules showed a sharp decline at the ash content of calcified anaerobic granules in this study the svma decreased by 15 39 with the elevation of ash content the methanogenic activity of calcified anaerobic granules went down quickly 7 s v m a c a s m a m a x s 1 a s h k s s v p m v s v s s v p m a s h a s h where s

concentration which was 6 76 g l here 5 conclusions the calcium content of calcified anaerobic granules was ten times higher than that of control anaerobic granules a large part of calcium accumulated in the center of anaerobic granules in the form of calcite and a small part of calcium covered the surface of anaerobic granules in the form of ca p deposit the calcium core occupied a large volume that was available for the functional microorganisms the deposit of calcium salts in the anaerobic granules caused the significant decline of macropore volume the elevation of mass transfer resistance and the decrease of mass transfer flux eventually leading to the deterioration of methanogenic activity the substrate gradient resulted from the methanation of organic salts including organic calcium salts was deduced to be the driving force of anaerobic granule calcification while the gradual accumulation of calcium salts in granular sludge was deduced to be the dominant factor for the decline of

granules a large part of the calcium accumulated in the center of anaerobic granules in the form of calcite and a small part of the calcium distributed in the outer layer of anaerobic granules in the form of ca p deposit the calcium core occupied a large space which was available for the functional microorganisms the calcium salts deposited in the outer layer of granular sludge which led to the significant reduction of macropore volume the porosity of calcified anaerobic granules decreased by 13 compared with that of control anaerobic granules causing generally the decline of methanogenic activity for example by 13 at influent organic concentration of 6 6 g cod l 1 the substrate gradient created by methanation of organic salts including organic calcium salts was deduced to be the

performance appels et al 2011 functional microorganisms as the heart of granular sludge endow the granular sludge with the metabolic activity extracellular polymeric substance eps which forms the skeleton of granular sludge promotes the aggregation of microorganisms pores locate between cells and eps can be considered as the arteries of granular sludge in the bioreactor microorganisms aggregate into granular sludge and then the granules accumulated to make up the sludge bed to support the reaction function of anaerobic reactor pores are not only the structure of granular sludge but also the liquid and gas channel for mass transfer afridi et al 2018 davit et al 2013 according to the ministry of ecology and environment of china ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china 2017 chemical oxygen demand cod ranks first among the pollutants of wastewater the wastewater of paper industry is huge and its cod discharge accounts for a very important part in the industrial wastewaters the wastewater of paper mills generally contains calcium kim et al 2004 which is an essential nutrient of microorganisms and plays an irreplaceable role in maintaining cell structure and promoting physiological activities madigan et al 2012 calcium can also promote the sludge granulation by bridging the eps of cells lu et al 2015 however the high calcium concentration affects the granule structure and interferes with the physiological function dang et al 2014 langerak et al 2000 each anaerobic granule has a certain volume in which cell eps and pore occupy a specific proportion respectively due to the microbial metabolism an increased ph profile is existing in the anaerobic granule promote the precipitation of calcium salts in the core of granules kim et al 2004 cunha et al 2018b that effect was affected by operational conditions of bioreactors cunha et al 2018a feldman et al 2019 the calcium salts occupy the space that is available for the cell colonization reduce the density of functional microorganism and decrease in activity per volume due to dilution of biomass batstone et al 2002 van langerak et al 1998 on the other hand the high calcium concentration in the wastewater could alter the granule structure studies have shown that granules cultured in wastewater with high calcium content has larger particle size ren et al 2008 jiang et al 2003 meanwhile calcium salts deposited in the outer layer may block the pores of the granule cunha et al 2018b two types of granule structure variation will lead to the increase of mass transfer resistance of granular sludge afridi et al 2018 wu et al 2016 and eventually leads to the inactivation of functional microorganisms with the granular sludge from the laboratory reactors the aim of this work was to determine the distribution pattern of calcium salts in calcified anaerobic granules investigate the variation in physical and chemical properties of granular sludge caused by calcification and analyze the deactivation mechanism of calcified anaerobic granular sludge providing a reference for eventually solving the problem of anaerobic treatment of organic wastewaters with

anaerobic granule was 0 895 and the ash tss was 0 105 the chemical analysis indicated that the calcium content of calcified anaerobic granule was 234 49 mg g tss while that of control anaerobic granule was 21 73 mg g tss fig 2 a the calcium content of calcified granular sludge was 9 79 times higher than the counterpart p 0 01 single tailed t test the precipitation of calcium ion is closely related to anions the chemical analysis indicated that the phosphorus content by tss of calcified anaerobic granule was 1 90 mg g tss while that of control anaerobic granule was 2 53 mg g tss fig 2b the phosphorus content of calcified anaerobic granule was lower than the counterpart significantly p 0 01 single tail t test out of our expectation the phosphorus content of calcified anaerobic

compared with the control granules no significant difference was observed for the small pore distribution pore diameter 10 μm but a great difference was found for the macropore distribution pore diameter 10 μm in calcified anaerobic granules in addition the overall porosity of calcified granules was also 13 lower than the counterpart the size distribution of anaerobic granule was determined quantitatively which was shown in fig s2 it has been acknowledged that the lower limit size of granular sludge was defined as 0 2 mm de kreuk et al 2007 the size range of anaerobic granule was 0 4743 μm based on the average size the anaerobic granules could be divided into 6 groups floc 200 μm fine granule 200 1000 μm small granule 1000 2000 μm medium granule 2000 3000 μm coarse granule 3000 4000

coarse granule was 3 9 28 5 34 6 23 7 and 9 1 respectively the vmd of calcified anaerobic granules was 2573 μm in average by contrast among the control anaerobic granules the percentage of floc was only 0 2 the percentage of fine granule small granule medium granule coarse granule and extra coarse granule was 3 0 11 6 40 1 35 2 and 9 9 respectively the vmd of control anaerobic granules was 2878 μm in average the difference of size distribution was not so large between the calcified anaerobic granules and the control anaerobic granules and only the percentage of small granule of calcified anaerobic granules was higher than the counterpart significantly 16 86 p 0 01 double tailed t test no significant difference of vmd was observed either between the calcified anaerobic granules and the counterpart p 0 09 double tailed t test 3 2 the form and distribution of calcium in anaerobic granule x ray diffraction xrd analysis is an efficient tool to distinguish the crystalline structure from the amorphous structure mañas et al 2011 the calcium core of calcified anaerobic granule was analyzed using xrd to determine the main form of calcium salt and its diffractogram was shown in fig 3 by peak search and phase retrieval jade 5 obvious diffraction peaks were observed when 2θ was at 23 08 29 43 36 02 39 45 43 20 47 52 and 48 54 among which 2θ 29 34 was the major peak by comparison with reference spectra all the peaks including the biggest one coincided with those of calcite caco3 jcpds no 05 0586 indicating that calcite was the main form of calcium core the crystallinity of calcite in calcium core was 92 91 proving that the crystallization was almost complete the distribution of inorganic crystals in the anaerobic granules were analyzed using x ray computed tomography the results were shown in fig 4 and fig s3 the brighter regions in the atlas were associated with the relatively high density material i e inorganic crystal which demonstrated the higher intensity in the shadow image conversely the darker regions corresponded to the relatively low density material i e air space a lot of inorganic crystals was observed in the calcified anaerobic granules which were mainly distributed in the center meanwhile some inorganic crystals of about 100 μm were embedded in the organic matters of outer layer fig 4 by contrast only a few inorganic crystals of several hundred microns was seen in the control anaerobic granules which were randomly distributed inside the granule fig s3 the inorganic crystals in the calcified anaerobic granules were far more than those in the control anaerobic granules sem coupled with eds were conducted to determine the distribution and elemental composition of calcium salt in the calcified anaerobic granules and the typical images were shown in fig 5 a lot of plate crystal clusters were observed in the outer layer whose size was in the range of 10 100 μm fig 5a and b eds analyses indicated that the outer crystal clusters were mainly composed of o c ca and p and the atomic ratio was about 5 07 1 01 1 0 97 table s2 on the surface of calcium core distributed the prismatic crystals fig 5c and d which were mainly composed of three elements o c and ca with the atomic ratio about 4 73 3 64 1 table s2 because of the interference of organic matter near the crystal with the scanning of sem eds the atomic proportion of c o in this study was higher than that of standard calcium salts e g cahpo4 ca p o 1 1 4 caco3 ca c o 1 1 3 3 3 methanogenic activity of calcified anaerobic granule methane production is one of the main functions of anaerobic granule the methanogenic activity of calcified anaerobic granule was determined using batch tests and the results were shown in fig 6 the influent cod concentration of ic reactor in paper mills was about 6 6 g cod l 1 at this cod concentration the sma of calcified anaerobic granule was 32 54 ml g vss h while the corresponding value of control anaerobic granule was 31 53 ml g vss h the above activity rates were within the range found in existing literature and close to the upper limit cunha et al 2018b schmidt and ahring 1996 in addition at this inlet concentration 6 6 g cod l 1 no significant difference of sma was observed between the calcified anaerobic granule and the control anaerobic granule p 0 33 single tailed t test the specific volume methanogenic activity svma of calcified anaerobic granule was 3 52 ml ml h while the corresponding value of control anaerobic granule was 4 05 ml ml h indicating that the svma of calcified anaerobic granule was significantly lower than the counterpart 13 1 p 0 03 single tailed t test the relationship between sma and cod was fitted by monod equation and the results were shown in fig 6 and eq 2 5 the sma max and svma max of calcified anaerobic granule were 69 42 ml g vss h and 7 52 ml ml h while the corresponding values of control granular sludge were 45 87 ml g vss h and 5 89 ml ml h the sma max and svma max of calcified anaerobic granule were 0 51 and 0 28 times higher than those of control anaerobic granule respectively it indicated that the calcification of anaerobic granule did not reduce the methanogenic potential the k s of calcified anaerobic granule was 8 95 g cod l while the corresponding value of control anaerobic granule was 3 57 g cod l the k s of calcified anaerobic granule was 2 51 times as high as the counterpart when the svma of calcified anaerobic granule reached a half of svma max of control anaerobic granule the cod was 5 90 g l which was 0 65 times higher than the k s of control anaerobic granule above all the substrate affinity of calcified anaerobic granule was obviously lower than that of control anaerobic granule 2 s m a n o m l g v s s h 45 87 c o d 3 57 c o d

abundance and activity of calcified anaerobic granule the abundance and activity of methanogenic cells were characterized using qpcr and rt qpcr as shown in fig 7 the specific biomass and specific volume mcra gene abundance of calcified anaerobic granule were 1 67 1010 copies g vss and 1 80 109 copies ml in average while those of control anaerobic granule were 3 92 109 copies g vss and 5 04 108 copies ml to our surprise the specific biomass and specific volume mcra gene abundance of calcified anaerobic granule were significantly higher than the counterpart p 0 01 double tailed t test indicating that the abundance of methanogenic cells in the calcified anaerobic granule was higher than that in the control anaerobic granule the higher abundance of methanogenic cells was consistent with the higher methanogenic potential of calcified anaerobic granule in the experiment of methanogenic kinetics the specific biomass and specific volume mcra gene transcription level of calcified anaerobic granule was 4 83 108 copies g vss and 6 20 107 copies ml in average while those of control anaerobic granule were 3 92 109 copies g vss and 5 04 108 copies ml the specific biomass and specific volume mcra gene transcription level of calcified anaerobic granule was significantly lower than the counterpart p 0 01 and p 0 04 respectively double tailed t test indicating that the activity of methanogen in the calcified anaerobic granule was lower than that in the control anaerobic granule 4 discussion 4 1 the coverage of calcium salts on the surface pore blockage microbial community is the main factor determining the active potential of anaerobic granules the results of qpcr shown that the abundance of methanogenic cells in the calcified anaerobic granules was higher than that in the control anaerobic granules it can be concluded that the different methanogenic activity between calcified granule and control granule at low cod concentration is not caused by the different species or quantity of functional microbe in anaerobic bioreactor pollutants are uptake and converted by functional microorganisms after they enter the anaerobic granule through the pores it is reported that the mass transfer is the rate limiting step in the decomposition of organic pollutants by the anaerobic granules al rubaye et al 2018 ghorbanian et al 2014 a good pore structure is an important guarantee for the metabolic activity of anaerobic granules without the liquid flow the solute or substrate is mainly transported into the anaerobic granules by diffusion davit et al 2013 mu et al 2006 according to the solute transfer model of anaerobic granules afridi et al 2018 wu et al 2016 the molecular diffusion flux is proportional to the granule porosity in the larger pore substrate can be transported by seepage for example stoodley et al 1994 recorded the liquid flow in the ten micron scale pore of biofilm using superimposed time sequence image the pore size of anaerobic granule ranged from 0 3 nm to 91 μm which could be divided into capillary pore the diameter is 0 1 μm 1 mm whose volume was dominant in the anaerobic granule and ultracapillary pore the diameter is less than 0 1 μm which is filled with bound water and is ineffective for mass transfer huang and li 2012 xu et al 2019 the capillary pores are important for the mass transfer of granules but the importance varies with pore sizes according to hu 2018 the most probable pore size of anammox granule ranges from 10 μm to 29 μm in the study of wu et al 2016 there are volume peaks when the pore diameter was around 10 μm in the pore volume diagram of large granules and these volume peaks were absent in the pore volume diagrams of small and medium granules the large granules were thought to possess a better mass transfer ability than the small and medium granules in this research pore structure of control was in line with previous studies however pores with a diameter lager than 10 μm which could be defined as good pores was rare in calcified anaerobic granules the seepage in capillary pores follows darcy s law v kj v seepage rate k permeability coefficient j hydraulic gradient the seepage rate is proportional to the permeability coefficient and the latter is positively related to the pore diameter li 2004 in conclusion the macropore of anaerobic granules which was rare in calcified anaerobic granules is an important channel for the mass transfer as shown in fig 2c no obvious difference of small pore distribution pore diameter 10 μm was observed between the calcified anaerobic granules and control anaerobic granules but a large difference of macropore distribution pore diameter 10 μm was found between the two anaerobic granules the porosity and average pore diameter of calcified anaerobic granules were significantly smaller than the counterpart which were 87 and 74 of control granular sludge respectively table s3 the sem observation showed that a lot of ca p crystal clusters distributed in the outer layer of calcified anaerobic granules whose size was in the range of macropore 10 100 μm these calcium deposits in the outer layer of anaerobic granules is speculated to block the macropore leading to the deterioration of mass transfer this speculation received a strong support from the methanogenic kinetics of anaerobic granules the half saturation constant of calcified anaerobic granules was obviously larger than that of control anaerobic granules indicating a lager mass transfer resistance of calcified anaerobic granules baeten et al 2018 fox and suidan 1990 in the experiment of methanogenic activity cod 6 6 g cod l 1 the svma of calcified anaerobic granules was 13 1 lower than that of control anaerobic granules which confirmed the decrease of porosity 13 and coincided with the calculated value based on the model reported by afridi et al afridi et al 2018 wu et al 2016 eq 6 despite the higher methanogenic potential the blockage of ca p crystal clusters caused a significant decline of svma 6 f m d 4 π r 2 d m c 0 ε ϕ where f m d was the molecular diffusion rate r was the radius of anaerobic granule d m was the diffusivity of substrate c 0 was the substrate concentration in the bulk solution ε was dimensionless porosity and was the assumed diffusion layer from the surface into the center of granule in this study the difference of granule size between the two anaerobic granules could be neglected when the substrate concentration of medium is determined the molecular diffusion rate into the surface of anaerobic granule was proportional to the porosity of anaerobic granule 4 2 the deposit of calcium salts in the granule space occupation the anaerobic microbial cells firstly assemble into aggregates with the help of eps and divalent cation hulshoff pol et al 2004 and then form the anaerobic granule to endow the bioreactor with the function of pollutant transformation ca2 is an essential nutrient for anaerobic microorganisms madigan et al 2012 and it is also an accelerating agent of sludge granulation lu et al 2015 wan et al 2015 however the excessive accumulation of calcium salt in the anaerobic granule will occupy the space that is supposed to be available for functional microorganisms leading to the decrease of cell density and metabolic activity in anaerobic granules the specific biomass and specific volume mcra gene abundance of calcified anaerobic granules were significantly higher than those of control anaerobic granules while the specific biomass and specific volume mcra gene transcription level of calcified anaerobic granules was significantly lower than the counterpart indicating that the methanogenic activity of calcified anaerobic granules decreased although the methanogenic potential was high the calcified anaerobic granules were taken from an ic reactor of paper mill whose influent cod concentration fluctuated largely and whose methanogenic redundancy was high in anaerobic granules although a large amount of calcium salts total calcium content 23 by dry weight deposited in the calcified anaerobic granules some granules have a calcium nuclei with the diameter more than 1 mm the current ash content did not significantly reduce the methanogenic potential of anaerobic granules the accumulation of ash in anaerobic granules is a gradual process during the treatment of organic wastewaters with high calcium batstone et al 2002 in order to characterize the effect of calcium core on the activity of calcified anaerobic granules the relationship between svma and ash content of calcified anaerobic granules based on the metabolic kinetics of calcified anaerobic granules sma max ks was established with the influent cod concentration for the ic reactor in paper mill eq 7 fig 8 with the elevation of ash content the svma of anaerobic granules showed a sharp decline at the ash content of calcified anaerobic granules in this study the svma decreased by 15 39 with the elevation of ash content the methanogenic activity of calcified anaerobic granules went down quickly 7 s v m a c a s m a m a x s 1 a s h k s s v p m v s v s s v p m a s h a s h where s m a m a x was 69 42 ml g vss h k s was 8 95 g l v p m v s was the wet volume per gram vss which was 7 69 ml g v p m a s h was the wet volume per gram ash which was 0 82 ml g s was the cod concentration which was 6 76 g l here 5 conclusions the calcium content of calcified anaerobic granules was ten times higher than that of control anaerobic granules a large part of calcium accumulated in the center of anaerobic granules in the form of calcite and a small part of calcium covered the surface of anaerobic granules in the form of ca p deposit the calcium core occupied a large volume that was available for the functional microorganisms the deposit of calcium salts in the anaerobic granules caused the significant decline of macropore volume the elevation of mass transfer resistance and the decrease of mass transfer flux eventually leading to the deterioration of methanogenic activity the substrate gradient resulted from the methanation of organic salts including organic calcium salts was deduced to be the driving force of anaerobic granule calcification while the gradual accumulation of calcium salts in granular sludge was deduced to be the dominant factor for the decline of

18484,when operating reverse electrodialysis red with several hundreds of cell pairs a large stack voltage of more than 10 v facilitates water electrolysis even when redox couples are employed for the electrode reaction upon feeding natural water containing multivalent ions ion crossover through a shielding membrane causes inorganic scaling around the cathode and the interior of the membrane stack due to the combination with the hydroxide ions produced via water reduction in this work we introduce a bipolar membrane bpm as a shielding membrane at the cathode to suppress inorganic precipitation water splitting in the bilayer structure of the bpm can block the ions diffusing from the catholyte and the feed solution maintaining the current density to evaluate the effect of the bpm on the inorganic precipitates diluted sea salt solution is allowed to flow through the outermost feed channel near the cathode in order to maintain as large a stack voltage as possible which is important to induce water splitting in the bpm when incorporated into an red stack of 100 cell pairs we measure the electric power of the red according to the arrangement of the bpm and compare it with that of conventional red the degree of inorganic scaling is also compared according to the kind of shielding membrane used anion exchange membrane cation exchange membrane and bpm neosepta or fumasep the bpm neosepta shows the best performance for suppressing the formation of precipitates it can hence be used to design a highly stable electrode system for long term operation of a large scale red feeding

selectivity and precipitation due to ph control failure can facilitate water electrolysis water reduction at the cathode results in a very fast increase in the ph of the electrolyte leading to

spacers in not only the cathode chamber but also the internal stack get clogged by inorganic precipitates and the iems around the cathode get contaminated with severe scale fouling in a large scale red stack with 1000 cell pairs feeding natural sea water and wastewater to suppress inorganic scaling around the cathode of such an red system we utilized a bipolar membrane bpm in this work bpms have

dissociation of water h2o h oh occurs at the interface where the cel and ael are in direct contact and the produced hydroxide ions and protons migrate out of the respective layer in opposite

formation of oxide hydroxides from redox species fe2 fe3 ions however the mechanism they explained is slightly ambiguous because the cel of the bpm is directed toward the cathode considering that the red system is a kind of galvanic cell in which the cathode is a positive electrode tedesco et al 2016 counter ions including protons in the cel should migrate to the cel ael interface this reverse bias causes the formation of water at the interface region thus leading to the destructive swelling of the membrane layers wilhelm et al 2002 in this work therefore the bpm was correctly positioned as a shielding membrane the cel and ael of the bpm were directed toward the feed solution and catholyte respectively this arrangement allowed the bpm to undergo water splitting under a stack voltage and block the crossover of the multivalent ions and hydroxide ions without structural deformation 2 experimental 2 1 reverse electrodialysis red stack and operation the membrane stack of the lab scale red

england 3 results and discussion a basic membrane stack with 100 cell pairs is illustrated in fig s1 sea water and river water alternately flow through the thin channels between the iems the outermost membranes positioned on both ends of the stack are called shielding membranes which play a role in separating the electrolyte and the feed solution to minimize the effect of multivalent ions on the cathode and the evolution of toxic chlorine gas at the anode river waters were fed as outermost feed solutions ofss into both the outermost feed compartments for which we used a cem and an aem as the shielding membranes at the anode and cathode respectively han et al 2019 we utilized water electrolysis as the electrode reaction to simulate a large scale red system consisting of several hundreds of cell pairs where water electroreduction oxidation occurred due to a large stack voltage even when redox couples were employed han et al 2019 fig 1 shows an arrangement of a membrane stack for red with a bpm for suppressing inorganic precipitation this configuration is called bpm red the aem which was a shielding membrane at the cathode in the basic configuration called as original red aem was replaced with the bpm the other components are similar to those in the basic configuration fig s1 the cel and ael of the bpm are directed toward the feed solution and catholyte respectively which is directly opposite to the orientation in hameler s patent hamelers et al 2007 during red operation water splitting occurs at the junction of the bpm due to a stack voltage which is the forward bias for the bpm hydroxide ions and protons move in opposite directions which leads to a low ph of the ofs near the cathode moreover the bilayer structure of the bpm does not allow the multivalent ions in the ofs to move into the catholyte under basic ph conditions therefore we expected that inorganic scaling around the cathode in the red system could be suppressed by utilizing water splitting and the bilayer structure of the bpm to evaluate the effect of the bpm on the electric power of the red system we measured the i p curves of the original red aem and bpm neosepta red while feeding artificial feed solutions tap water and 3 wt nacl fig 2 a the maximum power densities p d m a x of the original red and bpm red were 0 970 and 0 825 w m 1 respectively a 15 reduction in p d m a x was observed for the bpm red the stack voltage of the bpm red decreased more sharply compared with that of the original red fig 2b which led to a 12 4 reduction from 98 85 a m 2 to 86 62 a m 2 in the maximum current this indicated that the electrode resistance including that of the shielding membrane could not be ignored when the stack of 100 cell pairs was operated the conductivities of both the es and ofs were very low due to the use of tap water under this condition the resistance of the bpm was added to the electrode resistance which resulted in a substantial decrease in p d m a x and the current when the ofs was artificial sea water the difference in p d m a x decreased to 4 8 fig s2 which was expected to be solely attributable to the resistance of the bpm we also measured the variation in the membrane voltage fig 2c during the i p curve measurement using ag agcl reference electrodes the membrane voltage at a very low current was constant at 10 v because the control voltage range of the potentiostat we used was 10 v since the current increased the membrane voltage was normally measured the difference between the membrane voltages of the original red and bpm red was 600 mv which indicated an overpotential for water splitting in the bpm compared with the stack voltage 4 v at p d m a x the contribution of the voltage loss due to the overpotential at the bpm corresponds to 15 which is not negligible however for pilot scale red systems consisting of hundreds of cell pairs it is expected that the voltage loss and power loss induced by the bpm would not have a significant effect on the electric power han et al 2019 nam nam et al 2019 reported that a pilot scale 1000 cell pair system fed with wastewater effluent and seawater shows 15 reduction in p m a x during 12 days woven spacers around inlet parts were clogged with aggregates the electrode as well as spacers and outer membranes near the cathode were covered with dense inorganic precipitates although this reduction in p m a x was not solely caused by inorganic scaling around the cathode if the red system operates for more than several months power loss by inorganic scaling in a conventional configuration is expected to be higher than 4 8 loss which arises from water splitting in the bpm owing to anti inorganic fouling fig 3 a and b shows the surface of bpm neosepta after i p curve measurements depending on the arrangement of the bpm when the cel of the bpm is directed toward the cathode the bpm is under a reverse bias and hence hydroxide ions and protons migrate into the intermediate layer where water is generated which results in the destructive swelling of the membrane layers fig 3b the sem image also shows delaminated layers fig 3d this structural deformation has a negative effect on the electric power i e a 20 reduction in p d m a x fig s3 on the other hand when the ael of the bpm is directed toward the cathode water splitting occurs at the interface under a forward bias without structural deformation ballooning with water is not visible fig 3a and the sem image shows that two layers are firmly attached to each other fig 3c therefore the structural variation according to the arrangement of the bpm indicates that water is split at the interface of the bpm under a forward bias which is driven by the stack voltage of the red system meanwhile there was a clear color change with a mesh electrode pattern under the forward bias while the areas in contact with the mesh electrode and the blank area were the original orange color the area in contact with the es turned light orange it is assumed that the orange color originated from the fe element which is used as a catalyst for enhancing water splitting hanada et al 1991 we performed an xps point analysis sensing diameter 500 μm to measure the fe2p intensity for the three areas fig 3e the area in contact with the es showed a 16 greater reduction in the fe2p intensity compared with the other area which indicated that the concentration of the catalyst fe in this region decreased it is expected that the decrease in fe concentration is ascribed to the effect of hypochlorite on the surface of bpm because there was no change in fe concentration or color when the es at either electrode was kept separate please note that the original setup for the es included sharing of es in circulation from both electrodes the electrooxidation of chloride ions at the anode produces chlorine which dissociates in water to form hypochlorite it is known that hypochlorite can deform the iem and decrease permselectivity mei et al 2018 however the change in the amount of fe did not have a negative effect on the red operation a stable electric power was recorded at a constant load 50 ω for 1 5 h fig s4 there are several options for fabricating an red stack feeding the sea salt solution in order to observe the effect of multivalent ions on the red performance and evaluate the role of the bpm in suppressing inorganic scaling high or low concentration sea salt solutions can pass through the entire feed channels in this case however the multivalent ions cause a significant decrease in the output parameters including the current stack voltage and electric power moreover considering the overpotentials for water electrolysis 2 2 v at the electrodes and water splitting 0 6 v at the bpm it was expected that the resultant stack voltage and current would become very small and not be sufficient for effective water splitting at the bpm to address this issue and mimic a large scale red system with the bpm we added a feed channel by placing a spacer a gasket and an iem on the existing shielding membrane at the cathode to let the diluted sea salt solution as the ofs flow through only this new outermost feed channel fig s5 using this stack configuration we could minimize the voltage drop due to multivalent ions thereby facilitating water splitting at the interface of the bpm we conducted two kinds of measurements before analyzing the surfaces of the shielding membrane 1 ten continuous measurements of i p curves for original red cem and bpm fumasep red 2 constant load test for original red aem and bpm neosepta red fig 4 a shows the i p curves of the original red cem and bpm fumasep red with different ofss both the red systems with sea salt as the ofs showed a decrease in p d m a x by more than 20 compared to the case where 3 wt nacl was used as the ofs the stack voltage also significantly decreased the decline rate at 30 a m 2 was 60 fig 4b the decline rate of the current density at 10 ω was 36 fig 4c this major effect of the multivalent ions corresponds to previous results in the literature post et al 2009 vermaas et al 2014b zhu et al 2018 importantly the bpm red showed lower decrease rates 21 6 of p d m a x than the original red 25 7 in addition the electric power of the bpm red at more than 30 a m 2 was almost the same or even slightly larger than that of the original red this inversion trend also appears in the i v and i r u curves the inversions of the stack voltage and current density occur at 28 a m 2 and 35 ω respectively this implies that bpm red can produce a higher electric power in the range of high current densities beyond p d m a x a high current density facilitates water splitting at the contact region of the bpm which can suppress a crossover of multivalent ions and hydroxide ions between the ofs and es although the difference in the output parameters in the inversion region is small it is expected that the difference will become larger when the red system is operated for a longer period the inversion behavior was also observed during the constant load tests we applied a specific load at which a high current flows beyond the maximum power fig 4d 25 and 15 ω were applied for the bpm neosepta red for 30 min each in the case of the original red aem a single resistance 25 ω was applied for 1 h because 15 ω was out of the current range although the electric power of the bpm red was smaller than that of the original red initially it steadily increased and became larger than that of the original red after 10 min after the two kinds of measurements the red stacks were opened up and the surfaces of the shielding membranes were analyzed using sem and edx fig 5 the front and back sides indicate the sides of the shielding membranes facing the es and ofs respectively the sem images show that precipitates were extensively formed on the back side of the aem fig 5a and b and were in the form of flowers consisting of thin layers with a thickness of several nanometers fig s6a the reverse is the case in the cem fig 5c and d the front side was covered by dense inorganic precipitates in the form of nanorods fig s6b whereas there were few precipitates on the surface of the back side on the other hand in the cases of the two kinds of bpms dense precipitates were scarcely formed on both sides of the membranes the front surface of bpm neosepta was very clear without the presence of any precipitates whereas the back side was dotted sparsely with some precipitates in the case of bpm fumasep some large precipitates were formed on the back side compared to other shielding membranes fig 5e h the results of edx analysis confirmed that the main element in these precipitates was mg with a trace of ca fig s7 which indicated that mg oh 2 was the main deposit fig 6 compares the edx data for the different shielding membranes mg was predominantly detected on the back side of the aem and the front side of the cem as indicated by the sem images these results can be ascribed to the permselectivity of the shielding membrane when the aem is used as a shielding membrane hydroxide anions produced from water reduction at the cathode diffuse to the ofs due to anion permselectivity which results in the formation of insoluble hydroxide via the combination with multivalent ions fig s8a on the contrary multivalent ions diffuse to the es when the cem is used as a shielding membrane giving rise to the formation of inorganic scaling on the front side of the shielding membrane fig s8b therefore if a general ion exchange membrane with a single surface charge is used as a shielding membrane the inorganic scaling on one side of the shielding membrane is inevitable for both the bpms it was confirmed that there was no mg and ca on the front side some mg was detected on the back side of these bpms which was much less than that on the back side of the aem or the front side of the cem the back side of bpm neosepta exhibited a high resistance to the precipitation by ca2 whereas the back side of bpm fumasep showed a significant peak for ca which originated from some large deposits with a diameter of 5 μm fig 5h it is expected that this unusual result is related to the intrinsic property e g chemical affinity of the backbone for ca of bpm fumasep overall bpm neosepta under a forward bias showed a much greater ability to block the crossover of hydroxide ions and multivalent ions compared to bpm fumasep it is worth mentioning that the ph of the outflow of the ofs was basic 10 and some parts of the bpm where the inlet and outlet were positioned were contaminated with inorganic precipitates fig s9 even though the effective area of the bpm was free from precipitates this may indicate that current flows in the reverse direction in these parts not involved in the effective area of the iems or the geometrical area of the cathode which indicates an ionic shortcut current arising from the transport of ions through the feed and drain channels veerman et al 2008 this shortcut current also called current leakage causes efficiency loss in the red system veerman et al suggested dimensionless parameters ρ r and r r where ρ is the lateral resistance along the spacers r is the resistance of the feed and drain channels between two adjacent cells and r is the internal resistance of the cell to describe the ionic shortcut loss a higher r r ratio corresponds to a higher efficiency therefore the operation of the bpm neosepta red with pore filled ion exchange membranes kim et al 2015 having much lower membrane resistance 0 3 0 4 ω cm2 is now in progress to reduce the precipitation around the inlet and outlet 4 conclusions we demonstrated the first proof of concept that inorganic scaling around the cathode of an red system can be suppressed by utilizing a bpm in which the ael and cel are directed toward the cathode and anode respectively this arrangement allows water splitting at the junction region of the bpm under a forward bias thereby maintaining its structural stability the effect of water splitting on the performance of red feeding artificial feed solutions with 100 cell pairs was evaluated a 5 reduction in p d m a x was observed due to the overpotential for water splitting to evaluate the effect of the bpm on the inorganic precipitates we let a diluted sea salt solution flow in the outermost feed channel of the stack which could maintain a large stack voltage and facilitate water splitting in the bpm dense precipitates were formed on one side of the aem and cem which were used as the shielding membranes however there was little precipitation on both sides of the bpms especially bpm neosepta this huge difference in precipitation indicates that the water splitting at the bilayer structure of the bpm blocks the crossover of hydroxide ions and multivalent ions owing to electroneutrality this study offers a good method to maintain a highly stable electrode system and keep the internal resistance of the stack sufficiently low in pilot scale red systems feeding natural water moreover this strategy for antifouling is a concurrent process alongside red operation and is different from pre or post treatment for which additional electric power or facility is required we confirmed that some parts of the bpm where the inlet and outlet were positioned were contaminated with inorganic precipitates even though the effective area of the bpm was free from precipitates further investigation is needed to know how the inorganic scaling is

18484,when operating reverse electrodialysis red with several hundreds of cell pairs a large stack voltage of more than 10 v facilitates water electrolysis even when redox couples are employed for the electrode reaction upon feeding natural water containing multivalent ions ion crossover through a shielding membrane causes inorganic scaling around the cathode and the interior of the membrane stack due to the combination with the hydroxide ions produced via water reduction in this work we introduce a bipolar membrane bpm as a shielding membrane at the cathode to suppress inorganic precipitation water splitting in the bilayer structure of the bpm can block the ions diffusing from the catholyte and the feed solution maintaining the current density to evaluate the effect of the bpm on the inorganic precipitates diluted sea salt solution is allowed to flow through the outermost feed channel near the cathode in order to maintain as large a stack voltage as possible which is important to induce water splitting in the bpm when incorporated into an red stack of 100 cell pairs we measure the electric power of the red according to the arrangement of the bpm and compare it with that of conventional red the degree of inorganic scaling is also compared according to the kind of shielding membrane used anion exchange membrane cation exchange membrane and bpm neosepta or fumasep the bpm neosepta shows the best performance for suppressing the formation of precipitates it can hence be used to design a highly stable electrode system for long term operation of a large scale red feeding

when the ofs was artificial sea water the difference in p d m a x decreased to 4 8 fig s2 which was expected to be solely attributable to the resistance of the bpm we also measured the variation in the membrane voltage fig 2c during the i p curve measurement using ag agcl reference electrodes the membrane voltage at a very low current was constant at 10 v because the control voltage range of the potentiostat we used was 10 v since the current increased the membrane voltage was normally measured the difference between the membrane voltages of the original red and bpm red was 600 mv which indicated an overpotential for water splitting in the bpm compared with the stack voltage 4 v at p d m a x the contribution of the voltage loss due to the overpotential at the bpm corresponds to 15 which is not negligible however for pilot scale red systems consisting of hundreds of cell pairs it is expected that the voltage loss and power loss induced by the bpm would not have a significant effect on the electric power han et al 2019 nam nam et al 2019 reported that a pilot scale 1000 cell pair system fed with wastewater effluent and seawater shows 15 reduction in p m a x during 12 days woven spacers around inlet parts were clogged with aggregates the electrode as well as spacers and outer membranes near the cathode were covered with dense inorganic precipitates although this reduction in p m a x was not solely caused by inorganic scaling around the cathode if the red system operates for more than several months power loss by inorganic scaling in a conventional configuration is expected to be higher than 4 8 loss which arises from water splitting in the bpm owing to anti inorganic fouling fig 3 a and b shows the surface of bpm neosepta after i p curve measurements depending on the arrangement of the bpm when the cel of the bpm is directed toward the cathode the bpm is under a reverse bias and hence hydroxide ions and protons migrate into the intermediate layer where water is generated which results in the destructive swelling of the membrane layers fig 3b the sem image also shows delaminated layers fig 3d this structural deformation has a negative effect on the electric power i e a 20 reduction in p d m a x fig s3 on the other hand when the ael of the bpm is directed toward the cathode water splitting occurs at the interface under a forward bias without structural deformation ballooning with water is not visible fig 3a and the sem image shows that two layers are firmly attached to each other fig 3c therefore the structural variation according to the arrangement of the bpm indicates that water is split at the interface of the bpm under a forward bias which is driven by the stack voltage of the red system meanwhile there was a clear color change with a mesh electrode pattern under the forward bias while the areas in contact with the mesh electrode and the blank area were the original orange color the area in contact with the es turned light orange it is assumed that the orange color originated from the fe element which is used as a catalyst for enhancing water splitting hanada et al 1991 we performed an xps point analysis sensing diameter 500 μm to measure the fe2p intensity for the three areas fig 3e the area in contact with the es showed a 16 greater reduction in the fe2p intensity compared with the other area which indicated that the concentration of the catalyst fe in this region decreased it is expected that the decrease in fe concentration is ascribed to the effect of hypochlorite on the surface of bpm because there was no change in fe concentration or color when the es at either electrode was kept separate please note that the original setup for the es included sharing of es in circulation from both electrodes the electrooxidation of chloride ions at the anode produces chlorine which dissociates in water to form hypochlorite it is known that hypochlorite can deform the iem and decrease permselectivity mei et al 2018 however the change in the amount of fe did not have a negative effect on the red operation a stable electric power was recorded at a constant load 50 ω for 1 5 h fig s4 there are several options for fabricating an red stack feeding the sea salt solution in order to observe the effect of multivalent ions on the red performance and evaluate the role of the bpm in suppressing inorganic scaling high or low concentration sea salt solutions can pass through the entire feed channels in this case however the multivalent ions cause a significant decrease in the output parameters including the current stack voltage and electric power moreover considering the overpotentials for water electrolysis 2 2 v at the electrodes and water splitting 0 6 v at the bpm it was expected that the resultant stack voltage and current would become very small and not be sufficient for effective water splitting at the bpm to address this issue and mimic a large scale red system with the bpm we added a feed channel by placing a spacer a gasket and an iem on the existing shielding membrane at the cathode to let the diluted sea salt solution as the ofs flow through only this new outermost feed channel fig s5 using this stack configuration we could minimize the voltage drop due to multivalent ions thereby facilitating water splitting at the interface of the bpm we conducted two kinds of measurements before analyzing the surfaces of the shielding membrane 1 ten continuous measurements of i p curves for original red cem and bpm fumasep red 2 constant load test for original red aem and bpm neosepta red fig 4 a shows the i p curves of the original red cem and bpm fumasep red with different ofss both the red systems with sea salt as the ofs showed a decrease in p d m a x by more than 20 compared to the case where 3 wt nacl was used as the ofs the stack voltage also significantly decreased the decline rate at 30 a m 2 was 60 fig 4b the decline rate of the current density at 10 ω was 36 fig 4c this major effect of the multivalent ions corresponds to previous results in the literature post et al 2009 vermaas et al 2014b zhu et al 2018 importantly the bpm red showed lower decrease rates 21 6 of p d m a x than the original red 25 7 in addition the electric power of the bpm red at more than 30 a m 2 was almost the same or even slightly larger than that of the original red this inversion trend also appears in the i v and i r u curves the inversions of the stack voltage and current density occur at 28 a m 2 and 35 ω respectively this implies that bpm red can produce a higher electric power in the range of high current densities beyond p d m a x a high current density facilitates water splitting at the contact region of the bpm which can suppress a crossover of multivalent ions and hydroxide ions between the ofs and es although the difference in the output parameters in the inversion region is small it is expected that the difference will become larger when the red system is operated for a longer period the inversion behavior was also observed during the constant load tests we applied a specific load at which a high current flows beyond the maximum power fig 4d 25 and 15 ω were applied for the bpm neosepta red for 30 min each in the case of the original red aem a single resistance 25 ω was applied for 1 h because 15 ω was out of the current range although the electric power of the bpm red was smaller than that of the original red initially it steadily increased and became larger than that of the original red after 10 min after the two kinds of measurements the red stacks were opened up and the surfaces of the shielding membranes were analyzed using sem and edx fig 5 the front and back sides indicate the sides of the shielding membranes facing the es and ofs respectively the sem images show that precipitates were extensively formed on the back side of the aem fig 5a and b and were in the form of flowers consisting of thin layers with a thickness of several nanometers fig s6a the reverse is the case in the cem fig 5c and d the front side was covered by dense inorganic precipitates in the form of nanorods fig s6b whereas there were few precipitates on the surface of the back side on the other hand in the cases of the two kinds of bpms dense precipitates were scarcely formed on both sides of the membranes the front surface of bpm neosepta was very clear without the presence of any precipitates whereas the back side was dotted sparsely with some precipitates in the case of bpm fumasep some large precipitates were formed on the back side compared to other shielding membranes fig 5e h the results of edx analysis confirmed that the main element in these precipitates was mg with a trace of ca fig s7 which indicated that mg oh 2 was the main deposit fig 6 compares the edx data for the different shielding membranes mg was predominantly detected on the back side of the aem and the front side of the cem as indicated by the sem images these results can be ascribed to the permselectivity of the shielding membrane when the aem is used as a shielding membrane hydroxide anions produced from water reduction at the cathode diffuse to the ofs due to anion permselectivity which results in the formation of insoluble hydroxide via the combination with multivalent ions fig s8a on the contrary multivalent ions diffuse to the es when the cem is used as a shielding membrane giving rise to the formation of inorganic scaling on the front side of the shielding membrane fig s8b therefore if a general ion exchange membrane with a single surface charge is used as a shielding membrane the inorganic scaling on one side of the shielding membrane is inevitable for both the bpms it was confirmed that there was no mg and ca on the front side some mg was detected on the back side of these bpms which was much less than that on the back side of the aem or the front side of the cem the back side of bpm neosepta exhibited a high resistance to the precipitation by ca2 whereas the back side of bpm fumasep showed a significant peak for ca which originated from some large deposits with a diameter of 5 μm fig 5h it is expected that this unusual result is related to the intrinsic property e g chemical affinity of the backbone for ca of bpm fumasep overall bpm neosepta under a forward bias showed a much greater ability to block the crossover of hydroxide ions and multivalent ions compared to bpm fumasep it is worth mentioning that the ph of the outflow of the ofs was basic 10 and some parts of the bpm where the inlet and outlet were positioned were contaminated with inorganic precipitates fig s9 even though the effective area of the bpm was free from precipitates this may indicate that current flows in the reverse direction in these parts not involved in the effective area of the iems or the geometrical area of the cathode which indicates an ionic shortcut current arising from the transport of ions through the feed and drain channels veerman et al 2008 this shortcut current also called current leakage causes efficiency loss in the red system veerman et al suggested dimensionless parameters ρ r and r r where ρ is the lateral resistance along the spacers r is the resistance of the feed and drain channels between two adjacent cells and r is the internal resistance of the cell to describe the ionic shortcut loss a higher r r ratio corresponds to a higher efficiency therefore the operation of the bpm neosepta red with pore filled ion exchange membranes kim et al 2015 having much lower membrane resistance 0 3 0 4 ω cm2 is now in progress to reduce the precipitation around the inlet and outlet 4 conclusions we demonstrated the first proof of concept that inorganic scaling around the cathode of an red system can be suppressed by utilizing a bpm in which the ael and cel are directed toward the cathode and anode respectively this arrangement allows water splitting at the junction region of the bpm under a forward bias thereby maintaining its structural stability the effect of water splitting on the performance of red feeding artificial feed solutions with 100 cell pairs was evaluated a 5 reduction in p d m a x was observed due to the overpotential for water splitting to evaluate the effect of the bpm on the inorganic precipitates we let a diluted sea salt solution flow in the outermost feed channel of the stack which could maintain a large stack voltage and facilitate water splitting in the bpm dense precipitates were formed on one side of the aem and cem which were used as the shielding membranes however there was little precipitation on both sides of the bpms especially bpm neosepta this huge difference in precipitation indicates that the water splitting at the bilayer structure of the bpm blocks the crossover of hydroxide ions and multivalent ions owing to electroneutrality this study offers a good method to maintain a highly stable electrode system and keep the internal resistance of the stack sufficiently low in pilot scale red systems feeding natural water moreover this strategy for antifouling is a concurrent process alongside red operation and is different from pre or post treatment for which additional electric power or facility is required we confirmed that some parts of the bpm where the inlet and outlet were positioned were contaminated with inorganic precipitates even though the effective area of the bpm was free from precipitates further investigation is needed to know how the inorganic scaling is
