was one of the largest c pools in rivers mao et al 2017 praise et al 2020 moreover dom is an important composition of the organic c pool in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems linking c cycles among terrestrial inland water and oceanic ecosystems battin et al 2008 williams et al 2016 therefore dom plays a critical role in regional and global c cycles bouillon et al 2003 larsen et al 2011 li et al 2020 dom the soluble organic compounds has complex structure and chemo diversity because of the aromatic groups comprising different degrees and types of substitution guo et al 2011 it participates in transportation of matter and biogeochemical cycles of nutrients as well as provides main substrates for aquatic microorganisms which varies in time and space and is controlled by its chemical constituents and characters causse et al 2017 previous studies revealed that the quality and quantity of dom are strongly influenced by monsoon rainfall agriculture and other anthropogenic activities

hydrological seasonality on water quality and changes in ecosystem carter et al 2012 monteith et al 2007 optical technology has been widely used to explore the compositions and sources of dom because

wagner et al 2015 moreover we can further analyze the composition and structure characteristics of dom using some key indices from three dimensional fluorescence spectrum derrien et al 2017 the three gorges reservoir tgr region is located in the upper reach of the yangtze river the tgr region has an area of approximately 58 000 km2 where the annual rainfall varies greatly the tgr region is mostly dominated by purple slope lands which easily causes surface runoff and water soil erosion jiang et al 2018a liu et al 2017 it understandably has large differences in human activities and terrestrial inputs in the tgr region because of huge area in addition dom characteristics and sources are not only site specific but also vary with seasonality praise et al 2020 therefore the variation of human activities and seasonal hydrological processes in the tgr region can cause substantial alterations of riverine dom optical properties by directly governing the sources of dom inputs or indirectly changing biological processes yang et al 2016 previous studies on dom optical properties in the tgr region focused on inland lakes water level fluctuation zones and periodically submerged soils jiang

the study area the study area is located in the tgr region e106 10 111 10 n28 44 31 40 china fig 1 the region is characterized by humid subtropical monsoon with a mean annual temperature ranging from 16 to 19 c annual mean precipitation is about 1250 mm and the relative humidity is about 77 li et al 2018b the soil types are purple soil regosols in fao taxonomy entisol in usd a taxonomy calcareous soil cambisols in fao taxonomy inceptisols in usd a taxonomy and yellow soil ferralosols in fao taxonomy oxisols in usd a taxonomy ma et al 2016 the primary land use types in this region are farmland and forest respectively accounting for 36 57 and 46 88 of total land area zhang et al 2019 the remaining land use types are composed of grasslands urban water bodies and abandoned lands accounting for 12 66 2 18 1 7 and 0 01 respectively fig 1 vegetables rice grain wheat fruits and poultry are the mainly farm and profitable crops in this region ma et al 2016 the study area is dominated by carbonate rocks and characterized by karst nature in the dry season 20 oct 5 nov 2015 66 water samples were collected from the tributaries and mainstream of rivers in the tgr region fig 1 in the wet season 21 jun 3 jul 2016 60 water samples were collected from the sample sites mentioned above 2 2 water sampling and analyses 5 l pre acid washed plastic containers were used to collect the running water samples at a water depth about 10 20 cm then pre baked whatman gf f 0 7 μm filters were used to filter water samples on the sampling day the filtration was stored in acid washed high density polyethylene bottles the bottles were then transported with ice and stored in the dark at 4 c until the further analyses uv vis absorbance spectra and eem fluorescence spectra were measured within one week of water samples collection the uv visible absorbance spectra were measured by a lambda uv vis spectrometer perkinelmer usa using millipore water as blank the measurement error was 5 the spectral slope s350 400 hansen et al 2016 a254 weishaar et al 2003 a280 and a350 kolic et al 2014 were used to examine the optical properties of dom the eem fluorescence spectra were performed by a spectrofluorometer hitachi f 2500 japan and using ultrapure water as the blank with 1 cm quartz cuvette with four polished windows the emission scans em were measured from 250 to 500 nm with excitation wavelengths ex from 200 to 400 nm and 2 nm increments all the fluorescence spectra were measuredin duplicatewithacoefficient of variation cv 2 murphy et al 2010 furthermore fluorescence index fi mcknight et al 2001 and freshness index β α from fluorescence spectroscopy can distinguish composition and properties of dom parafac modelling was performed by matlab software matlab r2007 and dom fluor toolbox murphy et al 2010 wang et al 2017 in parafac analysis better mathematical results can be obtained by correcting the rayleigh and raman scattering the procedure of parafac analysis included outlier identification residuals analysis the optimal number of components random initialization with 10 iterations and split half analysis the modeled dom components can be identified by the shape and location of spectra peaks the detail information about uv and fluorescence index mentioned above was shown in table s1 2 3 statistical analyses nonparametric mann whitney u test was used to evaluate seasonal variations of the eem fluorescence and uv vis absorbance of dom li et al 2018a principal component analysis pca was applied to identify the possible sources and compositions of dom li and zhang 2010 these analyses were performed by spss 18 0 for windows with significance at p 0 05 2 4 potential interferences analyses before detection of water samples we have considered the potential optical interferences in this study the variation induced by the inner filtration effect was about 10 table s2 ohno 2002 the uv absorbances induced by fe in the dry and wet season were 5 and 6 table s2 weishaar et al 2003 respectively the uv absorbances caused by nitrate were 1 both in the dry and wet seasons table s2 weishaar et al 2003 therefore the potential optical interferences mentioned above show minor influence and thereby can be negligible the information was detailed in our previous study ma and li 2020 3 results 3 1 the composition and characteristics of dom by uv vis absorbance the values of a254 a280 a350 and s350 400 are summarized in figs 2 and 3 and table s3 s350 400 demonstrated significant differences across seasons p 0 001 with much higher average 0 017 0 006 in the dry season than in the wet season 0 010 0 005 the mean values of a280 were similar between seasons 14 775 7 765 vs 14 322 13 518 m 1 but the median of a280 in the dry season was 1 69 fold higher than that in the wet season the mean value of a254 in the wet season was 1 31 fold higher than that in the dry season 22 047 20 009 vs 16 874 8 744 m 1 the mean value of a350 in the wet season was 1 29 fold higher than that in the dry season averaging 4 676 4 522 0 507 29 317 in the wet season and 3 635 1 726 0 783 9 189 in the dry season the obvious spatial changes of a254 a280 a350 and s350 400 can be found in the areas with different anthropogenic activities especially in the wet season fig 3 and table s3 cvs of a254 a280 a350 and s350 400 were 1 75 1 79 2 04 and 1 42 fold higher in the wet season than in the dry season respectively higher values of cvs in the wet season indicated exceptionally high variability 3 2 parafac components of dom typical eem components of dom are shown in figs 4 and 5 and table 1 four and three components were extracted from the fluorescent eem dataset of dom using parafac analysis in the dry and wet seasons respectively figs 4 and 5 in the dry season fig 4 and table 1 the c1 showed peak at excitation emission ex em 260 450 nm c1 could be classified as traditional humic like peak c coble 2007 coble et al 1998 which represented poly carboxylate humic acid and was usually derived from the breakdown of animal substances lee et al 2008 c2 with the ex em wavelengths of 230 275 320 nm was assigned to protein like peak b which represented tyrosine like substance coble 1996 2007 the c3 showed peak at ex em 230 425 nm it was similar to humic like peak a which represented poly aromatic humic acid stedmon et al 2003 the c4 showed two peaks at ex em 225 360 nm and at ex em 275 360 nm c4 was assigned to protein like peak t at ex em 225 275 340 nm which represented tryptophan like substance coble 1996 2007 in the wet season fig 5 and table 1 c1 had a peak with ex em maximum wavelengths at 260 420 nm and was classified to humic like peak a hur and cho 2012 dom had similar signal of c2 when compared to the dry season c3 with an obvious ex em wavelengths at 200 425 nm was characterized as humic like peak a c3 also had an unfeatured component with ex em wavelength at 300 425 nm which was assigned to be another humic like fluorophore such as the hydrophytic humic like component i e phytoplankton degradation coble 2007 zhao et al 2016 the percentages of fluorescent components c1 c2 c3 c4 in the dry and wet seasons are summarized in fig 6 and table s4 the percentage of four fluorescent components demonstrated significant differences between two seasons p 0 001 the percentage of humic like c1 and c3 was 63 in the wet season 1 75 fold higher than that in the dry season the percentage of protein like c2 and c4 was 64 in the dry season 1 73 fold higher than that in the wet season the cv values of the percentages of four fluorescent components were higher than 40 both in the two seasons especially cv values of components c3 and c4 were higher than 65 in the dry season 3 3 the pca analysis of dom quality to further analyze the contribution of temporal and spatial variation to dom composition and structure pca was used to identify the primary source of dom two principal components pcs with eigenvalue 1 were extracted in the dry season which explained about 89 31 of the total variance table 2 pc1 comprised 60 40 of the variance with strong loading of a280 a254 a350 s350 400 and moderate loading of β α and fi while pc2 explained 28 91 of the variance with strong loadings of β α and fi in the wet season two components explained 90 28 of the total variance table 2 pc1 consisted of a280 a254 a350 and s350 400 explaining 63 31 of the variance pc2 explained 26 97 of the total variance and was positively correlated with β α and fi 4 discussion compared with dry season the greater a254 and a350 and the relatively lower a280 fig 2 and table s3 indicated higher aromaticity and lignin as well as relative lower protein abundance in the wet season kolic et al 2014 weishaar et al 2003 the lower value of s350 400 in the wet season indicated the higher molecular weight when compared to the dry season fig 2 and table s3 helms et al 2008 these could be explained by substantial increases in terrestrial dom inputs by runoff and leaching pathways during the wet season meanwhile the lower light intensity in the wet season showed the benefit for the accumulation of high molecular weight and aromatic dom jiang et al 2018b previous studies showed higher aromaticity and molecular weight of dom in terrestrial systems than in most aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2019 furthermore enhanced surface runoff and leaching in the wet season induced more terrestrial organic matter input to rivers li and bush 2015 mao and li 2019 therefore terrestrial input by monsoonal precipitation largely contributed to the dom quality seasonality the high variability of parameters as reflected by cvs 35 3 table s3 and the spatial distribution of a254 a280 a350 and s350 400 fig 3 indicated clear spatial variability of dom the terrestrial inputs to rivers in the tgr region were highly different because of the large area with variable land use and human activities tang et al 2020 different terrestrial inputs with changing land use can change the optical property of dom in rivers fig 3 shi et al 2020 in the dry season the comparable aromaticity and lignin of dom were found among the farmland urban and forest areas there were higher protein abundance and lower molecular weight of dom in urban land use and farmland area along the river bank in the wet season fig 3 urban affected rivers had higher aromaticity and lignin in dom these implied that urban sewages and domestic discharges have more humus inputs resulting in variations of dom optical properties the higher protein abundance and lower molecular weight of dom were found in the urban land use and farmland area along the river bank consistent with previous studies kelton et al 2007 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 the findings could be explained as follows organic manure usage and nitrogen nutrients inputs in agriculture and urban living can improve protein like substances inputs moreover the increasing nitrogen and phosphorus loadings can promote primary production and metabolism of algae resulting in higher protein abundance ma and li 2020 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 the lower protein abundance aromaticity lignin and higher molecular weight of dom were observed in the forest affected rivers opposite to the optical properties of dom in the urban land use terrestrial inputs via surface runoff in the wet season in different areas implied the role of anthropogenic activities in changing dom optical characteristics and chemical composition the different spatial variations of dom optical properties in two seasons and the higher values of cvs in the wet season table s3 indicated that monsoonal precipitation contributed to the spatial variations of dom quality we therefore concluded that monsoonal precipitation and human activities largely contributed to the spatial and temporal variations of dom quality dom had smaller number of modeled fluorescent components in the wet season than the dry season figs 4 and 5 the tryptophan like component of c4 was only found in the dry season implying more biological production of organic compounds from autochthonous sources liu et al 2019 meanwhile more humic like substances were found in the wet season c1 had peak a which represented poly aromatic humic acid and usually derived from the breakdown of plant substances stedmon et al 2003 apart from the tyrosine like substance c2 in the wet season also had others humic like substances such as the microbial humic like component as reflected by the peak at ex em 300 310 nm chen et al 2016 the aquatic humic like component in c3 was only found in the wet season indicating more organic compounds from allochthonous sources relative to the dry season zhao et al 2016 these findings indicated that monsoonal rainfall enhanced terrestrial humic rich dom inputs and accumulation to the rivers shi et al 2020 the seasonal variations of dom modeled parafac components implied that allochthonous inputs by runoff and leaching pathways largely changed the optical property of dom in river systems the higher percentage of c1 and c3 fig 6 and table s4 indicated a higher percentage of humic like in the wet season than in the dry season this was consistent with the observation obtained from a254 a350 and s350 400 fig 2 and table s3 similar to a280 the larger percentages of c2 and c4 fig 6 and table s4 indicated a higher percentage of protein like in the dry season than in the wet season the seasonal variations of component percentages were also consistent with the previous studies table s5 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 suggesting that dom was primarily contributable to humic like substance in the wet season while protein like in the dry season the seasonal variation of dom fluorescence demonstrated variable dominant sources of dom in difference seasons with terrestrial inputs dominant in the wet season and autochthonous sources in the dry season tang et al 2020 in addition the cv values of the percent of components c3 and c4 showed exceptionally high spatial variability both in the dry and wet seasons table s4 we concluded different terrestrial inputs to rivers from the variable human activities across the vast studied area and more terrestrial and allochthonous input by monsoonal precipitation both the monsoonal climate and human activities drove the dom quality seasonal and spatial variations which was substantiated by uv vis absorbance spectra fig 3 in the dry season pc1 was characterized by the accumulative process of high molecular weight hmw and moderate protein like dom this was attributed to both terrestrial and autochthonous sources fichot and benner 2012 supported by high loadings of humic and lignin fractions and moderate loading of protein fractions jaffe et al 2008 pc2 was the accumulative process of autochthonous sources supported by high loadings of protein fractions and fresh dom shafiquzzaman et al 2014 in the wet season pc1 represented the aromatic humic like compounds and lignin fractions relating to terrestrial inputs by concentrated rainfall such as runoff and leaching pathways kolic et al 2014 ni et al 2020 pc2 was interpreted as the accumulative process of autochthonous sources supported by loadings of protein fractions and fresh dom shafiquzzaman et al 2014 pca indicated more terrestrial sources and weaker autochthonous sources of dom in the wet season than in the dry season which was consistent with the observation obtained from the source quantification of components a bi plot of fi and β α fig 7 further evidenced that both microbial and terrestrial derived dom contributed to the total dom pool both in the dry and wet seasons compared to the average fi in the wet season 1 63 table s6 the higher average fi in the dry season 1 84 table s6 demonstrated the stronger microbial and weaker terrestrial sources of dom mcknight et al 2001 the lower values of β α 0 87 table s6 in the wet season represented a lower proportion of fresh dom and more allochthonous sources of dom wilson and xenopoulos 2009 these findings were consistent with the results of pca thus both terrestrial inputs by monsoonal precipitation and in channel metabolism contributed to the dom quality temporal variations whilst their relative importance showed seasonality the distribution and optical properties of dom were closely related to pollutants in the aquatic system and therefore were largely controlled by human activities water quality can be monitored by spectrum technology such as eem fluorescence spectroscopy sgroi et al 2017 combining our results with previous studies the optical properties of dom are useful indicators for water pollution assessment and river management for instance source apportionment of dom can be utilized for pollution source determination which is useful for water protection the priorities of eem methods rapidity simplicity and low cost are critical for long term water quality monitoring which can ensure health and security of watershed ecosystem water quality monitoring assessment and management based on fluorescent dom is a promising strategy and can be extended to a large geographic scale using remote sensing data moreover fluorescent dom makes up some shortages of satellite such as weak signal in the ultraviolet band and data missing in the small rivers liu et al 2020 thus dom compositions and optical properties should be routinely incorporated in water quality assessment and watershed management 5 conclusion the dom composition structure and sources in the river systems of the three gorges reservoir tgr region were explored using optical indicators and eem parafac modeled components the seasonal and spatial variations of dissolved organic matter dom optical properties and composition highlighted the effects of anthropogenic activities and monsoonal climate the higher degree of humification aromaticity and lignin substances as well as lower protein abundance of dom could be found in the wet season dom showed an additional protein like component tryptophan like in the dry season indicating that biological and autochthonous sources could be the primary source of dom in the season principle component analysis and the percent of components indicated more terrestrial sources and weaker autochthonous sources of dom in the wet season the higher protein abundance and lower molecular weight were further found in the urban land use and farmland area along the river bank combined results demonstrated that human activities and hydrological seasonality are closely relevant to the compositions and sources of dom the findings will be conducive to improving our understanding on the crucial role of dom in biogeochemical cycles

rocks and characterized by karst nature in the dry season 20 oct 5 nov 2015 66 water samples were collected from the tributaries and mainstream of rivers in the tgr region fig 1 in the wet season 21 jun 3 jul 2016 60 water samples were collected from the sample sites mentioned above 2 2 water sampling and analyses 5 l pre acid washed plastic containers were used to collect the running water samples at a water depth about 10 20 cm then pre baked whatman gf f 0 7 μm filters were used to filter water samples on the sampling day the filtration was stored in acid washed high density polyethylene bottles the bottles were then transported with ice and stored in the dark at 4 c until the further analyses uv vis absorbance spectra and eem fluorescence spectra were measured within one week of water samples collection the uv visible absorbance spectra were measured by a lambda uv vis spectrometer perkinelmer usa using millipore water as blank the measurement error was 5 the spectral slope s350 400 hansen et al 2016 a254 weishaar et al 2003 a280 and a350 kolic et al 2014 were used to examine the optical properties of dom the eem fluorescence spectra were performed by a spectrofluorometer hitachi f 2500 japan and using ultrapure water as the blank with 1 cm quartz cuvette with four polished windows the emission scans em were measured from 250 to 500 nm with excitation wavelengths ex from 200 to 400 nm and 2 nm increments all the fluorescence spectra were measuredin duplicatewithacoefficient of variation cv 2 murphy et al 2010 furthermore fluorescence index fi mcknight et al 2001 and freshness index β α from fluorescence spectroscopy can distinguish composition and properties of dom parafac modelling was performed by matlab software matlab r2007 and dom fluor toolbox murphy et al 2010 wang et al 2017 in parafac analysis better mathematical results can be obtained by correcting the rayleigh and raman scattering the procedure of parafac analysis included outlier identification residuals analysis the optimal number of components random initialization with 10 iterations and split half analysis the modeled dom components can be identified by the shape and location of spectra peaks the detail information about uv and fluorescence index mentioned above was shown in table s1 2 3 statistical analyses nonparametric mann whitney u test was used to evaluate seasonal variations of the eem fluorescence and uv vis absorbance of dom li et al 2018a principal component analysis pca was applied to identify the possible sources and compositions of dom li and zhang 2010 these analyses were performed by spss 18 0 for windows with significance at p 0 05 2 4 potential interferences analyses before detection of water samples we have considered the potential optical interferences in this study the variation induced by the inner filtration effect was about 10 table s2 ohno 2002 the uv absorbances induced by fe in the dry and wet season were 5 and 6 table s2 weishaar et al 2003 respectively the uv absorbances caused by nitrate were 1 both in the dry and wet seasons table s2 weishaar et al 2003 therefore the potential optical interferences mentioned above show minor influence and thereby can be negligible the information was detailed in our previous study ma and li 2020 3 results 3 1 the composition and characteristics of dom by uv vis absorbance the values of a254 a280 a350 and s350 400 are summarized in figs 2 and 3 and table s3 s350 400 demonstrated significant differences across seasons p 0 001 with much higher average 0 017 0 006 in the dry season than in the wet season 0 010 0 005 the mean values of a280 were similar between seasons 14 775 7 765 vs 14 322 13 518 m 1 but the median of a280 in the dry season was 1 69 fold higher than that in the wet season the mean value of a254 in the wet season was 1 31 fold higher than that in the dry season 22 047 20 009 vs 16 874 8 744 m 1 the mean value of a350 in the wet season was 1 29 fold higher than that in the dry season averaging 4 676 4 522 0 507 29 317 in the wet season and 3 635 1 726 0 783 9 189 in the dry season the obvious spatial changes of a254 a280 a350 and s350 400 can be found in the areas with different anthropogenic activities especially in the wet season fig 3 and table s3 cvs of a254 a280 a350 and s350 400 were 1 75 1 79 2 04 and 1 42 fold higher in the wet season than in the dry season respectively higher values of cvs in the wet season indicated exceptionally high variability 3 2 parafac components of dom typical eem components of dom are shown in figs 4 and 5 and table 1 four and three components were extracted from the fluorescent eem dataset of dom using parafac analysis in the dry and wet seasons respectively figs 4 and 5 in the dry season fig 4 and table 1 the c1 showed peak at excitation emission ex em 260 450 nm c1 could be classified as traditional humic like peak c coble 2007 coble et al 1998 which represented poly carboxylate humic acid and was usually derived from the breakdown of animal substances lee et al 2008 c2 with the ex em wavelengths of 230 275 320 nm was assigned to protein like peak b which represented tyrosine like substance coble 1996 2007 the c3 showed peak at ex em 230 425 nm it was similar to humic like peak a which represented poly aromatic humic acid stedmon et al 2003 the c4 showed two peaks at ex em 225 360 nm and at ex em 275 360 nm c4 was assigned to protein like peak t at ex em 225 275 340 nm which represented tryptophan like substance coble 1996 2007 in the wet season fig 5 and table 1 c1 had a peak with ex em maximum wavelengths at 260 420 nm and was classified to humic like peak a hur and cho 2012 dom had similar signal of c2 when compared to the dry season c3 with an obvious ex em wavelengths at 200 425 nm was characterized as humic like peak a c3 also had an unfeatured component with ex em wavelength at 300 425 nm which was assigned to be another humic like fluorophore such as the hydrophytic humic like component i e phytoplankton degradation coble 2007 zhao et al 2016 the percentages of fluorescent components c1 c2 c3 c4 in the dry and wet seasons are summarized in fig 6 and table s4 the percentage of four fluorescent components demonstrated significant differences between two seasons p 0 001 the percentage of humic like c1 and c3 was 63 in the wet season 1 75 fold higher than that in the dry season the percentage of protein like c2 and c4 was 64 in the dry season 1 73 fold higher than that in the wet season the cv values of the percentages of four fluorescent components were higher than 40 both in the two seasons especially cv values of components c3 and c4 were higher than 65 in the dry season 3 3 the pca analysis of dom quality to further analyze the contribution of temporal and spatial variation to dom composition and structure pca was used to identify the primary source of dom two principal components pcs with eigenvalue 1 were extracted in the dry season which explained about 89 31 of the total variance table 2 pc1 comprised 60 40 of the variance with strong loading of a280 a254 a350 s350 400 and moderate loading of β α and fi while pc2 explained 28 91 of the variance with strong loadings of β α and fi in the wet season two components explained 90 28 of the total variance table 2 pc1 consisted of a280 a254 a350 and s350 400 explaining 63 31 of the variance pc2 explained 26 97 of the total variance and was positively correlated with β α and fi 4 discussion compared with dry season the greater a254 and a350 and the relatively lower a280 fig 2 and table s3 indicated higher aromaticity and lignin as well as relative lower protein abundance in the wet season kolic et al 2014 weishaar et al 2003 the lower value of s350 400 in the wet season indicated the higher molecular weight when compared to the dry season fig 2 and table s3 helms et al 2008 these could be explained by substantial increases in terrestrial dom inputs by runoff and leaching pathways during the wet season meanwhile the lower light intensity in the wet season showed the benefit for the accumulation of high molecular weight and aromatic dom jiang et al 2018b previous studies showed higher aromaticity and molecular weight of dom in terrestrial systems than in most aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2019 furthermore enhanced surface runoff and leaching in the wet season induced more terrestrial organic matter input to rivers li and bush 2015 mao and li 2019 therefore terrestrial input by monsoonal precipitation largely contributed to the dom quality seasonality the high variability of parameters as reflected by cvs 35 3 table s3 and the spatial distribution of a254 a280 a350 and s350 400 fig 3 indicated clear spatial variability of dom the terrestrial inputs to rivers in the tgr region were highly different because of the large area with variable land use and human activities tang et al 2020 different terrestrial inputs with changing land use can change the optical property of dom in rivers fig 3 shi et al 2020 in the dry season the comparable aromaticity and lignin of dom were found among the farmland urban and forest areas there were higher protein abundance and lower molecular weight of dom in urban land use and farmland area along the river bank in the wet season fig 3 urban affected rivers had higher aromaticity and lignin in dom these implied that urban sewages and domestic discharges have more humus inputs resulting in variations of dom optical properties the higher protein abundance and lower molecular weight of dom were found in the urban land use and farmland area along the river bank consistent with previous studies kelton et al 2007 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 the findings could be explained as follows organic manure usage and nitrogen nutrients inputs in agriculture and urban living can improve protein like substances inputs moreover the increasing nitrogen and phosphorus loadings can promote primary production and metabolism of algae resulting in higher protein abundance ma and li 2020 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 the lower protein abundance aromaticity lignin and higher molecular weight of dom were observed in the forest affected rivers opposite to the optical properties of dom in the urban land use terrestrial inputs via surface runoff in the wet season in different areas implied the role of anthropogenic activities in changing dom optical characteristics and chemical composition the different spatial variations of dom optical properties in two seasons and the higher values of cvs in the wet season table s3 indicated that monsoonal precipitation contributed to the spatial variations of dom quality we therefore concluded that monsoonal precipitation and human activities largely contributed to the spatial and temporal variations of dom quality dom had smaller number of modeled fluorescent components in the wet season than the dry season figs 4 and 5 the tryptophan like component of c4 was only found in the dry season implying more biological production of organic compounds from autochthonous sources liu et al 2019 meanwhile more humic like substances were found in the wet season c1 had peak a which represented poly aromatic humic acid and usually derived from the breakdown of plant substances stedmon et al 2003 apart from the tyrosine like substance c2 in the wet season also had others humic like substances such as the microbial humic like component as reflected by the peak at ex em 300 310 nm chen et al 2016 the aquatic humic like component in c3 was only found in the wet season indicating more organic compounds from allochthonous sources relative to the dry season zhao et al 2016 these findings indicated that monsoonal rainfall enhanced terrestrial humic rich dom inputs and accumulation to the rivers shi et al 2020 the seasonal variations of dom modeled parafac components implied that allochthonous inputs by runoff and leaching pathways largely changed the optical property of dom in river systems the higher percentage of c1 and c3 fig 6 and table s4 indicated a higher percentage of humic like in the wet season than in the dry season this was consistent with the observation obtained from a254 a350 and s350 400 fig 2 and table s3 similar to a280 the larger percentages of c2 and c4 fig 6 and table s4 indicated a higher percentage of protein like in the dry season than in the wet season the seasonal variations of component percentages were also consistent with the previous studies table s5 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 suggesting that dom was primarily contributable to humic like substance in the wet season while protein like in the dry season the seasonal variation of dom fluorescence demonstrated variable dominant sources of dom in difference seasons with terrestrial inputs dominant in the wet season and autochthonous sources in the dry season tang et al 2020 in addition the cv values of the percent of components c3 and c4 showed exceptionally high spatial variability both in the dry and wet seasons table s4 we concluded different terrestrial inputs to rivers from the variable human activities across the vast studied area and more terrestrial and allochthonous input by monsoonal precipitation both the monsoonal climate and human activities drove the dom quality seasonal and spatial variations which was substantiated by uv vis absorbance spectra fig 3 in the dry season pc1 was characterized by the accumulative process of high molecular weight hmw and moderate protein like dom this was attributed to both terrestrial and autochthonous sources fichot and benner 2012 supported by high loadings of humic and lignin fractions and moderate loading of protein fractions jaffe et al 2008 pc2 was the accumulative process of autochthonous sources supported by high loadings of protein fractions and fresh dom shafiquzzaman et al 2014 in the wet season pc1 represented the aromatic humic like compounds and lignin fractions relating to terrestrial inputs by concentrated rainfall such as runoff and leaching pathways kolic et al 2014 ni et al 2020 pc2 was interpreted as the accumulative process of autochthonous sources supported by loadings of protein fractions and fresh dom shafiquzzaman et al 2014 pca indicated more terrestrial sources and weaker autochthonous sources of dom in the wet season than in the dry season which was consistent with the observation obtained from the source quantification of components a bi plot of fi and β α fig 7 further evidenced that both microbial and terrestrial derived dom contributed to the total dom pool both in the dry and wet seasons compared to the average fi in the wet season 1 63 table s6 the higher average fi in the dry season 1 84 table s6 demonstrated the stronger microbial and weaker terrestrial sources of dom mcknight et al 2001 the lower values of β α 0 87 table s6 in the wet season represented a lower proportion of fresh dom and more allochthonous sources of dom wilson and xenopoulos 2009 these findings were consistent with the results of pca thus both terrestrial inputs by monsoonal precipitation and in channel metabolism contributed to the dom quality temporal variations whilst their relative importance showed seasonality the distribution and optical properties of dom were closely related to pollutants in the aquatic system and therefore were largely controlled by human activities water quality can be monitored by spectrum technology such as eem fluorescence spectroscopy sgroi et al 2017 combining our results with previous studies the optical properties of dom are useful indicators for water pollution assessment and river management for instance source apportionment of dom can be utilized for pollution source determination which is useful for water protection the priorities of eem methods rapidity simplicity and low cost are critical for long term water quality monitoring which can ensure health and security of watershed ecosystem water quality monitoring assessment and management based on fluorescent dom is a promising strategy and can be extended to a large geographic scale using remote sensing data moreover fluorescent dom makes up some shortages of satellite such as weak signal in the ultraviolet band and data missing in the small rivers liu et al 2020 thus dom compositions and optical properties should be routinely incorporated in water quality assessment and watershed management 5 conclusion the dom composition structure and sources in the river systems of the three gorges reservoir tgr region were explored using optical indicators and eem parafac modeled components the seasonal and spatial variations of dissolved organic matter dom optical properties and composition highlighted the effects of anthropogenic activities and monsoonal climate the higher degree of humification aromaticity and lignin substances as well as lower protein abundance of dom could be found in the wet season dom showed an additional protein like component tryptophan like in the dry season indicating that biological and autochthonous sources could be the primary source of dom in the season principle component analysis and the percent of components indicated more terrestrial sources and weaker autochthonous sources of dom in the wet season the higher protein abundance and lower molecular weight were further found in the urban land use and farmland area along the river bank combined results demonstrated that human activities and hydrological seasonality are closely relevant to the compositions and sources of dom the findings will be conducive to improving our understanding on the crucial role of dom in biogeochemical cycles

4771,rivers are the main source of molybdenum mo to the oceans and estuaries represent an important interface between rivers and oceans within which mo can be sequestered or isotopically fractionated determining the behavior of mo in estuaries is thus essential for a full understanding of the global mo cycle here we present a case study of the modern yangtze estuary and adjacent east china sea shelf generating mo concentration and isotopic data for both aqueous and solid phases i e suspended particulate matter or spm primarily consisting of clay minerals and al fe mn oxides aqueous mo concentrations increase rapidly from 13 9 nm river water to 115 nm seawater through the mixing zone of the innermost continental shelf minor deviations from a salinity based mixing relationship positive at 22 psu to negative at 22 34 psu indicate a shift from net desorption to net adsorption of mo on spm with increasing salinity aqueous δ98mo values increase rapidly within the mixing zone from 1 15 river water to 2 3 seawater whereas the δ98mo of spm exhibits a smaller increase in the oceanward direction from 0 25 to 0 27 aqueous δ98mo exhibits large negative deviations from a simple two component i e freshwater seawater mixing model due to operation of an additional process inferred to be mo exchange between the fluid and solid phases simulations using a reaction transport model phreeqc demonstrated that a combination of two processes i e freshwater seawater mixing and fluid solid mo exchange can account for observed patterns of mo concentrations and isotopes in the yangtze estuary the results of this study thus provide valuable insights into mo cycling in estuarine systems and indispensable quantitative data for global mo budgets keywords mo isotope ionic exchange suspended particulate matter phreeqc adsorption desorption 1 introduction molybdenum mo is an essential micronutrient required by enzymes catalyzing key reactions in the global cycles of carbon sulfur and nitrogen mendel and bittner 2006 wang 2012 marks et al 2015 as a redox sensitive trace metal mo has long been regarded to have potential as an oceanic paleo redox proxy holland 1984 emerson and huested 1991 in well oxygenated modern seawater mo exhibits relatively high and stable concentrations of 110 10 nm nmol l morris 1975 quinby hunt and turekian 1983 collier 1985 rahaman et al 2014 and uniform mo isotope compositions of 2 34 0 10 barling et al 2001 siebert et al 2003 nakagawa et al 2012 kendall et al 2017 due to its high solubility and long residence time of 440 kyr miller et al 2011 kendall et al 2017 rivers are the dominant source of dissolved mo to the ocean 90 whereas low temperature hydrothermal systems make a smaller contribution 10 siebert et al 2003 kendall et al 2009 miller et al 2011 modern rivers and streams exhibit a wide range of δ98mo values varying from 0 28 to 2 40 archer and vance 2008 pearce et al 2010 neubert et al 2011 voegelin et al 2012 wang et al 2015 king and pett ridge 2018 an average riverine δ98mo composition of 0 7 was calculated based on an analysis of rivers that cumulatively account for 22 of global fluvial discharge archer and vance 2008 this value is significantly higher than that of the bulk silicate earth δ98mo 0 04 0 12 greber et al 2015 which has been attributed to preferential trapping of isotopically light mo by solid phase weathering products in soils riverine particulates pearce et al 2010 siebert et al 2015 wang et al 2015 king 2017 king et al 2018 king and pett ridge 2018 enriching soil water and groundwater in the heavy isotopes of mo fractionation of mo isotopes occurs under certain conditions uptake by clay minerals and al fe mn oxy hydroxides results in preferential adsorption of lighter mo isotopes on particle surfaces goldberg et al 1996 2009 goldberg and forster 1998 barling and anbar 2004 wasylenki et al 2008 in natural systems the largest fractionation 98mosediment seawater 3 0 occurs during mo adsorption onto mn oxides in oxic seawater a process that has a weak dependence on temperature and ionic strength barling et al 2001 siebert et al 2003 barling and anbar 2004 wasylenki et al 2008 in addition biological processes can result in preferential uptake of light mo isotopes due to active microbial assimilation or adsorption onto cell surfaces liermann et al 2005 wasylenki et al 2007 zerkle et al 2011 the fractionation of mo adsorbed onto sedimentary organic matter is similar in magnitude and direction to that during uptake by fe mn oxy hydroxides king et al 2018 mo reacts with h2s in anoxic aqueous solutions to form thiomolybdates following the reaction series moo4 2 moo3s2 moo2s2 2 moos3 2 mos4 2 in which a large mo isotope fractionation occurs at each step tossell 2005 kendall et al 2017 thus changes in the fractional burial flux of mo to anoxic facies can influence global seawater δ98mo barling et al 2001 siebert et al 2003 in euxinic facies molybdate moo4 2 is converted to trithiomolybdate moos3 2 and tetrathiomolybdate mos4 2 where h2s aq exceeds a geochemical switchpoint at 11 µm resulting in near quantitative removal of aqueous mo to the sediment saxena et al 1968 diemann and muller 1973 erickson and helz 2000 kendall et al 2017 little to no fractionation of mo isotopes occurs during near quantitative removal of mo to the sediment as is common in strongly euxinic facies characterized by black shale deposition barling et al 2001 siebert et al 2003 cycling of mo in estuarine systems has been investigated only sporadically to date yielding evidence of both conservative and non conservative behavior see section 2 additional studies of mo cycling in estuaries are needed in order to document the range of natural variation in such systems furthermore although exchange of materials occurs between aqueous and solid phases in many estuaries morris et al 1978 sholkovitz 1995 lawrence and kamber 2006 the dynamic exchange of mo has not been documented in any estuarine system to date here we investigate the geochemical behavior of mo in the modern yangtze estuary and waters of the adjacent east china sea shelf based on mo concentration and isotopic data for both waters and spm in order to quantitatively constrain the dynamic exchange of mo we utilized an aqueous reaction transport model phreeqc to simulate observed patterns of variation in mo concentrations and isotopic compositions across the study area this study thus provides new information linking the terrestrial and marine mo reservoirs allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of mo cycling and quantification of global mo budgets 2 molybdenum behavior in estuarine systems an estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of water that is either permanently or episodically open to the sea and that receives at least periodic discharge from a river its salinity is thus less than that of seawater and decreases upchannel toward the riverine source potter et al 2010 estuaries represent transition zones in which rapid spatial and temporal variations in geochemical biological and sedimentological characteristics occur dalai et al 2005 dellwig et al 2007 pearce et al 2010 rahaman et al 2010 2014 within many estuaries strong exchange of materials between waters and spm linked to adsorption desorption reactions is known to occur especially under low brackish conditions salinity 10 psu practical salinity units morris et al 1978 sholkovitz 1995 lawrence and kamber 2006 molybdenum mo commonly exhibits conservative behavior during river water seawater mixing within estuaries with no significant effects linked to scavenging or remobilization this type of behavior can be inferred when mo concentrations show a linear relationship to salinity and δ98mo covaries linearly with 1 mo this pattern has been documented for waters of the rhine weser and elbe estuaries of germany schneider et al 2016 the itchen estuary of southeastern england archer and vance 2008 and the borgarfjörður estuary of norway pearce et al 2010 non conservative behavior of mo in estuarine mixing zones is recognized by deviations in mo concentrations and or isotopic compositions from a linear trend pearce et al 2010 rahaman et al 2010 2014 for example in the chao phraya estuary of thailand dissolved mo concentrations were much higher than expected for a simple mixing process at salinities of 5 psu dalai et al 2005 the excess mo in mixing zone waters was generated through release from spm or reductive remobilization of mo from estuary floor sediments during suboxic diagenesis on the other hand the hooghly and mandovi estuaries of india which contain dense mangrove swamps exhibited depletion of aqueous mo within the mixing zone relative to a simple mixing process rahaman et al 2010 mo loss was attributed to a combination of complexation with organic matter and removal to particulate aggregates undergoing decay or to reducing sediments on the estuary floor more complexly in the narmada estuary of india mo exhibits conservative behavior during the dry season but distinctly non conservative behavior during the monsoon season when release of isotopically light mo from fe mn oxyhydroxide particulates results in lower than normal δ98mo within the mixing zone rahaman et al 2014 non conservative mo behavior in estuaries may also be due to additional sources of mo such as anthropogenic inputs from agricultural fertilizer shipping and industrial waste water or submarine groundwater discharge dalai et al 2005 pearce et al 2010 gu et al 2012 yin et al 2015 wang et al 2016 gurumurthy et al 2017 king and pett ridge 2018 liu et al 2018 2019 in the tapi estuary of india unusually high dissolved mo concentrations and deviations of mo isotopes from a linear trend were attributed to anthropogenic influences as this watershed contains major steel and lime industries rahaman et al 2010 2014 all of these factors can influence mo budget calculations based on observational data rahaman et al 2014 further studies of the behavior of mo and its isotopes in estuarine systems are necessary in order to better constrain global mo cycling and to more confidently apply mo isotope proxies to paleoenvironmental analysis 3 study area the yangtze river has a total length of 6300 km from its source in the tibetan plateau to its mouth near shanghai where it flows into the east china sea its drainage basin occupies an area of 1 81 106 km2 at 25 35 n and 91 122 e chen et al 2001 yang et al 2006 ding et al 2014 its annual discharge of 1 1012 m3 is the third greatest of any river globally and it carries 4 14 108 tons of sediment to the ocean each year cwrc 2008 ding et al 2014 most of its drainage basin is situated in a subtropical monsoon region which has annual precipitation ranging from 800 to 1600 mm ding et al 2013 the monsoonal climate results in elevated water and sediment discharge during the wet season from may to october 70 of the annual total and reduced discharge during the dry season from november to april yang et al 2002 xu and milliman 2009 hu et al 2009 luo et al 2012 the average flow rate at datong located 600 km upstream from the river s mouth was 20 800 m3 s in march 2015 data from the web of hydrological information for chinese rivers http xxzx mwr gov cn which is nearly the same as at xuliujing in the upper yangtze estuary tang et al 2011 the temperature of yangtze river water decreases upstream but averages 16 18 c throughout the middle and lower river basin ding et al 2013 the yangtze estuary which is mesotidal with a mean tidal range of 2 3 m is 120 km long and 90 km wide at the river mouth wang and liu 2003 hu et al 2009 it is divided into deltaic distributary channels below xuliujing including the north branch north passage north channel and south channel by the islands of chongming changxing hengsha and jiuduansha the present study follows the main navigation channel south channel which has stronger discharge and lower watermass salinity than the other channels fig 1 zhang et al 2012 as the river enters the estuary unidirectional riverine flow yields to bidirectional tidal flow kundu and cohen 2004 geyer and maccready 2014 de souza machado et al 2016 the tidal signal can reach upchannel as far as datong 600 km from the estuary mouth in the dry season but is limited to downstream stations i e less than 350 km from the estuary mouth in the wet season fig 1 zhang et al 2018 the entire estuary and adjacent continental shelf are influenced by river runoff and tides and their co equal strength during flood tides is a major driver of watermass mixing in the outer estuary yu and zhang 2017 in the south channel spm generally increases in concentration from xuliujing to the estuary mouth with an upchannel downchannel shift in spm during summer winter related to seasonal variations in river discharge chen et al 2004 the turbidity maximum zone tmz where spm concentrations 70 mg l are greatest is co extant with the outer estuary to innermost east china sea shelf shen et al 1992 jiang et al 2013 in addition to its complicated topography human activity is another influence on the chemical and physical dynamics of the yangtze estuary the nearby megacity of shanghai with its large scale shipping and manufacturing activities affects metal concentrations and their distribution processes yin et al 2015 for example mo containing alloy steel and iron is used in shipbuilding drilling energy generation including boilers steam turbines and electricity generators and chemical and petrochemical processing imoa human sources such as agricultural fertilizer marine transport discharge and smelter factory waste contribute heavy metals to the yangtze estuary yin et al 2015 liu et al 2019 although these contributions have not been adequately quantified to date because of the lack of quantitative data for anthropogenic mo sources we will not incorporate them explicitly in our modeling or subsequent analysis 4 materials and methods 4 1 sampling samples for this study were collected along an oceanward to landward transect on march 13 15 2015 as part of the scientific investigation of the yangtze estuary project of the national natural science foundation of china voyage id norc2015 03 in 2015 the freshwater discharge from yangtze river to the estuary was higher than average for the wet season 80 from april to september relative to the dry season 20 from october to march liu et al 2018 water age defined as the time that a unit of water has spent within the estuarine system is 11 7 3 0 days in the dry season based on modeling of 224ra 223ra activity data liu et al 2018 hence water compositional variations related to the 3 day sampling period of the present study are unlikely to be consequential during the research cruise the river s ambient physical and chemical conditions were monitored through measurements of ph salinity and concentrations of spm water samples were collected from the inner and outer estuary c1 c8 the mixing zone a6 1 to a6 7 and the east china sea shelf a6 8 to a6 11 note samples a6 6 a6 8 and a6 10 are not reported below because they were not analyzed at each station except for a6 1 water samples were collected from the surface 0 m middle 4 5 28 m and lower 5 53 m layers of the river continental shelf watermass fig 1 table 1 water samples were collected in pre cleaned high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate filters by shz d iii shb 3 water circulating vacuum pump on field the filtered water samples representing the fluid phase were acidified to ph 2 5 using double sub boiling distillation concentrated hno3 for storage the spm was separated from the fluid phase during the filtering process and rinsed with high purity deionized milli q water diw to leach salts the filters with spm were dried at 45 for 30 minutes in an electrothermal constant temperature drying oven and then stored in a freezer prior to analysis 4 2 geochemical analyses elemental concentrations were analyzed using an agilent technologies 7700 series inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms in the state key laboratory of geological processes and mineral resources gpmr of the china university of geosciences cug wuhan china high salinity water samples were usually diluted to suitable concentrations with 2 hno3 and an internal standard in before analysis about 50 mg of each spm sample were digested in teflon bombs with 3 ml acid a 1 1 mixture of concentrated hno3 and hf at 190 c for 48 h the digested spm sample solutions were then evaporated to dryness and redissolved in 3 ml of acid being a 1 1 1 mixture of concentrated hno3 diw and 1 ppm indium at 190 c for 12 h a further dilution with 2 hno3 to a suitable volume was carried out for the final analysis the icp ms internal precision was generally better than 3 and the precision of duplicates was better than 5 for most elements the analytical detection limit was 1 nm for mo and 2 nm for fe and mn cf centineo et al 2011 mineralogic compositions of the spm were determined by x ray diffraction xrd using an x pert prody2198 at the gpmr the spm samples were scraped gently from filters suspended in ultrapure water and pipetted on glass slides before analysis xrd patterns were recorded at a scanning speed of 0 418 s using cu kα radiation 40 ma and 40 kv peak identification was based on a clay mineral catalog mo isotope purification was carried out under class 100 laboratory conditions all acids were purified by double sub boiling distillation in teflon stills and the labware was cleaned in concentrated reagent grade acids and diw prior to use about 250 ml of low salinity water samples c1 to c8 or about 30 ml of high salinity water samples a6 1 to a6 11 were evaporated with addition of a 97mo 100mo double spike the spm samples with 97mo 100mo double spike were digested in teflon bombs with 3 ml acid a 1 1 mixture of concentrated hno3 and hf at 190 c for 48 h after these pretreatments a 7 m hcl with 0 03 h2o2 was used to dissolve samples prior to column separations which followed a modified protocol from siebert et al 2006 the anion exchange resin ag mp 1m bio rad 100 200 mesh was used to separate mo from analytes causing isobaric interferences e g zr and ru and polyatomic interferences caused by matrix elements e g k na ca mg and fe and then a cation exchange resin ag 50w x8 bio rad 200 400 mesh was used to further separate mo from the remaining fe zhou et al 2012 2016 cheng et al 2016 the purified mo samples were diluted in 5 hno3 prior to measurement using a neptune plus thermo finnigan scientific bremen germany multi collector icp ms at gpmr wuhan china the mo isotope compositions in this study are reported relative to the johnson matthey company jmc mo standard solution lot 602332b siebert et

comparison with other studies delta per mille notation for the mo isotope ratio is defined as δ98mo 98mo 95mo sample 98mo 95mo jmc 1 1000 the mo isotope compositions of modern seawater and usgs reference agv 2 relative to the jmc standard are 2 30 0 03 2sd n 3 and 0 11 0 06 2sd n 3 respectively which are in good agreement with previous reported values goldberg et al 2013 nägler et al 2014 willbold et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 kendall et al 2017 the reproducibility of the measured δ98mo ratios is better than 0 06 4 3 reaction transport modeling in order to better understand controls on mo within the yangtze estuary an aqueous reaction batch and transport model was coded using phreeqc phreeqc version 3 is a computer program written in the c and c programming languages that is designed for simulation of chemical reactions and transport processes in natural waters laboratory experiments and industrial processes appelo and postma 2005 parkhurst and appelo 2013 it is applicable to many hydrogeochemical processes such as mixing of waters the action of irreversible reactions in solutions dissolving and precipitating phases to achieve equilibrium with the aqueous medium and the effects of temperature variation each simulation includes a database file an input file and an output file phreeqc contains a series of thermodynamic database equations that can be extended or modified to make the simulation more accurately reflect actual conditions the setup for the code of an input file is important for the simulation of a phreeqc model see supplement for full details of the reaction transport model our phreeqc simulations modeled river flow into a marine watermass resulting in progressive mixing of freshwater and seawater the model simulated one dimensional transport of water including advection dispersion and diffusion processes advection was modeled by using average river velocity which is 0 2 0 5 m s local history of shanghai 2008 reactions between fluid and solid phases were influenced by physical and chemical conditions of the mixed watermass including ph and salinity as well as by ionic exchange with spm the concentration and isotopic composition of mo were calculated for each aqueous and solid phase at every grid cell the model boundary conditions included defined chemical compositions of the freshwater and seawater endmembers and the solid surface parameters of each station based on measured data freshwater discharge and dispersivity values were tuned to achieve an optimal match between simulated and observed mo concentrations the exchange ratios of mo between fluid and solid phases yielded by this model will be discussed in section 6 4 5 results the geochemical data and δ98mo results for this study are given in table 1 the salinity of the water samples ranged from 0 16 psu for the freshwater endmember to 34 psu for the seawater endmember the latter value corresponding to a reported salinity of 33 9 psu in the east china sea delcroix and murtugudde 2002 the ph of the yangtze estuary and waters of the adjacent east china sea shelf varied from 7 10 for the freshwater endmember to 8 10 for the seawater endmember the mineral compositions of spm are given in supplementary table s1 which mainly consist of clay minerals and quartz with smaller amounts of feldspar calcite and dolomite dissolved mo concentrations range from 11 8 nm for the freshwater endmember to 118 nm for the seawater endmember with a small bulge positive anomaly at station c7 fig 2 that may be associated with dump site 1 of oceanic dredged materials fig 1 the mo concentration of the seawater endmember of this study is consistent with that of average global seawater 110 10 nm morris 1975 quinby hunt and turekian 1983 collier 1985 rahaman et al 2014 the spm exhibits mo concentrations ranging from 0 63 to 1 98 μg g δ98mo for the fluid phase ranges from 1 08 to 2 39 with strongly rising values down channel of station a6 1 122 06 e and relatively uniform high values oceanward of station a6 9 123 50 e fig 2 the δ98mo of the freshwater endmember falls within the range of reported modern fluvial values 0 28 to 2 40 archer and vance 2008 pearce et al 2010 neubert et al 2011 voegelin et al 2012 wang et al 2015 king and pett ridge 2018 and the δ98mo of the seawater endmember is consistent with that of global seawater 2 34 0 10 barling et al 2001 siebert et al 2003 nakagawa et al 2012 kendall et al 2017 at each station except for a6 1 water samples were taken from three depths within the river i e the surface middle and lower layers but these samples yielded nearly identical values at each station with no systematic variation as a function of water depth reflecting vertical homogenization of mo isotopes within the fluvial water column fig 2 for this reason we averaged the measured δ98mo of samples taken from three different depths at each station and these average values were then used for analysis of lateral variation of mo isotopes the spm exhibits relatively lower δ98mo values 0 25 to 0 27 and is more spatially variable two samples exhibit low values before station a6 1 122 06 e downchannel of which values rise steadily fig 2 relative to the water sample from the same station the δ98mo of spm is on average about 1 2 depleted in the western upchannel part of the transect and about 1 9 depleted at its eastern oceanward end 6 discussion 6 1 behavior of mo during estuarine mixing 6 1 1 relationship between mo concentrations and δ98mo of estuary waters the theoretical mixing model of freshwater and seawater was calculated using equations from faure and mensing 2005 chapter 16 1 f a a a b where a and b are the weights of these components and fa represents the abundances of component a in a mixture of a and b 2 c m c a f a c b 1 f a where cm concentration of mo in the mixture m ca cb concentrations of mo in components a and b 3 δ m δ a f a c a c m δ b 1 f a c b c m where δm mo isotopic composition of a mixture m δa δb mo isotopic compositions of components a and b for simple two component systems conservative mixing always yields a straight line relationship on a δm vs 1 cm crossplot fig 3 faure and mensing 2005 in our model simulations the composition of the freshwater endmember was based on data from station c6 mo 16 4 nm δ98mo 1 13 and the seawater endmember on published values of 110 10 nm and 2 3 morris 1975 quinby hunt and turekian 1983 collier 1985 rahaman et al 2014 kendall et al 2017 relative to the expected linear relationship of δ98mo to 1 mo for a conservative two component mixing system fig 3 our dataset reveals a large negative anomaly for yangtze estuary waters this anomaly is indicative of the addition of isotopically light mo to and or loss of isotopically heavy mo from the fluid phase within the mixing zone a slight positive correlation between δ98mo and 1 mo was found in the low salinity zone c1 c8 fig 3 see section 6 3 for further discussion 6 1 2 relationship between mo concentrations and salinity of estuary waters in earlier mixing experiments between freshwater and seawater mo displayed largely conservative behavior with only minor anomalies related to mixing at intermediate salinities schneider et al 2016 in the study of head and burton 1970 mo concentrations and salinities yielded a linear relationship proving that fluid mixing was the main process influencing the distribution of mo in the southampton water i e the estuary at the mouths of rivers test and itchen in contrast small deviations of mo concentrations from the salinity based mixing relationship positive at 22 psu and negative at 22 34 psu were exhibited in the yangtze estuary and its adjacent waters fig 4 which will be discussed in section 6 3 active desorption and adsorption processes must be invoked to account for non conservative mo behavior in the yangtze estuary and its adjacent waters figs 3 and 4 the release of isotopically light mo from spm and groundwater discharge can potentially contribute dissolved mo to estuary waters dalai et al 2005 pearce et al 2010 concurrently adsorption of mo onto al fe mn oxyhydroxides or organic matter or uptake into reducing sediments can remove dissolved mo from the water column goldberg et al 1996 2009 goldberg and forster 1998 barling and anbar 2004 wasylenki et al 2008 rahaman et al 2014 wang et al 2016 all of these processes can lead to fractionation of mo isotopes within the estuarine system given that the fresh groundwater flux into the yangtze estuary is estimated to be just 3 of the yangtze river discharge during the dry season liu et al 2018 and the mo concentrations of the groundwater and river water are similar king et al 2016 neely et al 2018 the influence of groundwater on mo cycling in the yangtze estuary can be regarded as insignificant and groundwater fluxes will not be considered in the following analysis 6 2 mass balance modeling of mo behavior mo in the yangtze estuary and its adjacent water samples was analytically separated into fluid and solid spm phases the spm consists of a mixture of river borne particles and resuspended sediments and it is composed of clay minerals clastic silicates carbonate minerals fe oxyhydr oxides and organic compounds supplementary table s1 dalai et al 2005 ding et al 2013 2014 none of these phases contains significant primary mo and most or all of the mo in the spm is present in adsorbed form on clay minerals fe oxyhydr oxides and or organic materials a simple mass balance model was used to explore the interaction of mo between spm and estuary waters without considering the effects of river flow and rates of mo exchange exchange of mo between spm δ98mo 0 25 to 0 27 and waters δ98mo 1 08 to 2 39 is expected to result in higher δ98mo values for the former and lower values for the latter relative to the freshwater seawater mixed fluid endmember fig 5 the measured δ98mo of spm in the yangtze estuary and its adjacent waters has a narrow range around 0 0 similar to the average δ98mo of the bulk silicate earth δ98mo 0 04 0 12 greber et al 2015 according to the magnitude of δ98mo anomalies i e the deviations between measured fluid δ98mo and the theoretical two component fluid mixing model fig 3 we infer that the degree of exchange of mo between the fluid and spm increases from the upchannel end of the mixing zone to roughly its midpoint and thereafter decreases in the oceanward direction interactions between the fluid and spm lead to release of isotopically light mo 0 0 from spm to estuary waters as well as scavenging of isotopically heavy mo from the water column onto spm a three component mass balance model incorporating mo exchange between estuary waters representing a mixture of freshwater and seawater and spm can be calculated as follows 4 δ e δ m 1 f e δ spm f e where δe mo isotopic composition after exchange δm mo isotopic composition of the fluid at a given station based on the two component fluid mixing model of eq 3 δspm initial δ98mo of spm 0 0 and fe exchange ratio which is the ratio of soluble mo concentrations derived from spm to total dissolved mo concentrations three different degrees of mo exchange between spm and the estuarine watermass were modeled 20 weak 40 moderate and 80 strong these values represent the fractional amount of mo in the estuarine watermass at a given station that was derived from spm a δ98mo vs 1 mo crossplot fig 5 shows strong correspondence between the measured δ98mo values of the fluid and the moderate exchange curve this result suggests that mo exchange between fluid and spm has significantly influenced mo isotopic compositions across the study area 6 3 adsorption desorption of mo onto spm suspended particulate matter spm is expected to have a wide range of surface chemical properties and trace metal adsorption characteristics hatje et al 2003 it tends to preferentially adsorb mo with isotopically light signatures from the water column goldberg et al 1996 2009 goldberg and forster 1998 barling and anbar 2004 wasylenki et al 2008 mo with an isotopically light composition may be released from spm in estuaries due to a change in physical or chemical conditions pearce et al 2010 molybdenum adsorption onto spm phases is enhanced at low ph and diminishes at higher ph values 1 for clay minerals adsorption is maximized at ph 3 and declines to near zero at ph 7 and 2 for al and fe oxides adsorption is maximized at ph 4 and declines to near zero at ph 8 goldberg et al 1996 goldberg and forster 1998 in addition molybdenum adsorption onto mn oxides decreases from 99 at ph 6 5 to 70 at ph 8 5 barling and anbar 2004 therefore the mo adsorption capacity of spm is weak in watermasses with near marine ph including the modern yangtze estuary and its adjacent waters ph 7 1 8 1 the mn and fe concentrations of spm decline steadily along the study transect except for small increases at the estuarine shelf transition fig 6 b c reflecting a near continuous release of these elements to estuary waters in contrast the mo concentrations of spm are spatially variable first decreasing from station c1 to c8 then remaining unchanged at stations a6 1 to a6 7 and finally increasing slightly from station a6 7 to a6 11 fig 6a it is possible that mo undergoes simultaneous adsorption and desorption on spm throughout the estuary although with some spatial variation in the relative intensities of these processes relative to a two component freshwater seawater mixed fluid the higher than expected mo concentrations in low salinity water samples c1 c8 indicate relatively stronger release of mo from spm fig 6e cf zhang et al 2008 and the lower than expected mo concentrations in high salinity water samples a6 7 a6 11 indicate relatively stronger adsorption of mo onto spm fig 6e the positive relationships of mo with mn fig 7 a and mo with fe fig 7b in the low salinity samples suggest that the desorbed mo was associated with mn oxides and or fe oxyhydroxides the former may have played a larger role given that the relationship of mo with mn r 0 79 p 0 01 n 24 fig 7a is far stronger than that with fe r 0 28 p 0 18 n 24 fig 7b desorption sourced mo in the low salinity zone results in a weak positive correlation of δ98mo with 1 mo as shown in fig 3 the slight oceanward increase of δ98mo in the spm fig 2 is interpreted as the product of exchange of isotopically light mo in spm with isotopically heavy mo in mixing zone waters 6 4 reaction transport modeling of mo behavior the mass balance model in section 6 2 although capable of closely matching our measured data fig 5 cannot account for dynamic mixing processes such as advection through bulk movement of river flow dispersion and rate dependent processes such as mo exchange between the watermass and spm for this purpose phreeqc was used to simulate one dimensional water flow and reaction rates of mo between spm and estuary waters we discuss the results of these simulations below remobilization of sediment from the channel or shelf floor occurs readily in the tmz exchange ratio 80 based on sediment budget liu et al 2010 due to strong river and tidal flow however the sediment exchange ratio between the water column i e spm and the channel or shelf floor for sites outside of the tmz is much smaller 10 liu et al 2010 about 49 of the riverine spm is deposited in the tmz liu et al 2010 trace elements adsorbed onto particles are likely to be released during resuspension due to desorption of weakly bound metals from particulate surfaces hatje et al 2003 therefore the reversible mo interactions between spm and estuary waters are likely to occur in the yangtze estuary and its adjacent waters due to continuous inputs of spm resuspension of bottom sediments and varying physico chemical conditions in the mixing zone on a global scale fluvial suspended particulates contain 4 8 wt total fe including 2 wt as fe oxyhydr oxides martin and meybeck 1979 poulton and raiswell 2002 but only 0 1 wt total mn martin and meybeck 1979 with 0 08 wt as mn oxides canfield 1997 thamdrup 2000 in addition fe oxyhydr oxides and mn oxides have co equal affinity for molybdate under similar ph and ionic concentration conditions balistrieri and chao 1990 considering that the relationships of fe mo and mn mo of spm at stations a6 1 to a6 11 are similar fe mo r 0 50 p 0 01 n 24 mn mo r 0 50 p 0 01 n 24 and that fe oxyhydr oxides are more abundant than mn oxides in spm we assumed that the reactions of mo linked to spm on the inner continental shelf are mainly controlled by fe oxyhydr oxides the surface reactions between fe oxyhydr oxides and molybdate ions in the phreeqc input file were defined hydrous ferric oxides hfo were used as surface binding species which include strong binding sites hfo s and weak binding sites hfo w since the heterogeneities of mineral surfaces dzombak and morel 1990 the ratio of strong to weak sites was set at 1 40 parkhurst and appelo 2013 the reaction formulas of mo on surfaces were cited from the database minteq v4 dat in phreeqc see the supplement for details the amounts of surface binding sites were calculated using the spm concentrations and fe concentrations of spm from stations c6 to a6 11 the surface site density μmol m2 and the surface area m2 g maximum and minimum values were estimated from the literature the surface area for hfo averages about 600 m2 g dzombak and morel 1990 with a range of 200 800 m2 g based on values for goethite and ferrihydrite eusterhues et al 2005 the site density of hfo has a value of 3 83 μmol m2 0 094 for strong sites 3 74 for weak sites for the two site model dzombak and morel 1990 and 16 6 μmol m2 for the one site model sverjensky and sahai 1996 without attempting to account for specific mineral and binding site types these values give an indication of general particle surface parameters the total concentration of surface binding sites can be calculated as follows van benthem 2015 5 hfo tot a s c n s where hfo tot represents the total concentration of surface binding sites per volume solution as is the specific surface area in m2 g c is the concentration of spm in g l and ns is the surface site density in μmol m2 after model parameterization we simulated one dimensional 1d transport of river water flowing into seawater accompanied by mo exchange between spm and the fluid phase because station c7 may have been polluted by dump site 1 within a small radius around that point source station c6 and station a6 11 were chosen to represent the freshwater and seawater endmembers of the model respectively and the average elemental concentrations and ph values of each station i e the mean of its three vertical measurements were calculated distances between adjacent stations were calculated to establish the transport cell dimensions of the model the flow rate of the yangtze estuary was 0 2 0 5 m s local history of shanghai 2008 which was applied in the transport process of phreeqc model see the supplement for details different combinations of the hfo parameters were adopted as initial conditions for a set of model simulations and these were adjusted iteratively to achieve the best match of dissolved mo concentrations to our data observations the exchange ratio of mo i e the proportion of total dissolved mo derived from spm at each station was calculated using phreeqc the measured salinity of each station was used to calculate the proportion of freshwater in each aqueous sample which was then substituted into eqs 2 and 3 to calculate the δ98mo based on a simple two component mixing model with a freshwater endmember c6 mo 16 4 nm δ98mo 1 13 salinity 0 19 psu and a seawater endmember a6 11 mo 115 nm δ98mo 2 3 salinity 34 psu since no thermodynamic information is available for mo isotopes the phreeqc model was unable to simulate mo fractionation during transport which however can be calculated from eq 4 using the spm endmember with a δ98mo value of 0 0 the preceding δ98mo of the fluid phase based on a simple two component mixing model and the exchange ratios acquired from phreeqc the final results represent the δ98mo of estuary waters after mixing freshwater seawater and exchange with spm in the yangtze estuary and its adjacent waters fig 8 the δ98mo of estuary waters calculated by the exchange ratios acquired from phreeqc matched our measured data from the mixing zone well when the site density is 3 83 μmol m2 or 16 6 μmol m2 which showed insignificant variations for a modest range of surface areas 200 800 m2 g fig 8 thus these simulations matched the measured data well indicating that the behavior of mo in the mixing zone of the yangtze estuary is controlled by both mixing of freshwater and seawater and intense mo exchange between estuary waters and spm the good match between data observations and the phreeqc model results fig 8 indicates that the fractionation of dissolved mo is likely to be controlled by the mixing of freshwater and seawater and mo exchange reactions between spm and estuary waters within the mixing zone with regard to mo associated with spm desorption dominates over adsorption in the low salinity zone of the inner estuary whereas adsorption dominates over desorption in the near marine salinity zone of the east china sea these desorption adsorption reactions have little effect on aqueous mo concentrations due to the relatively small amounts of exchangeable mo in spm relative to mo in the water column however repeated cycling of mo between spm and estuary waters can have a significant effect on aqueous mo isotopic compositions cf rahaman et al 2014 previous studies have shown that river waters have relatively higher δ98mo values than spm voegelin et al 2012 rahaman et al 2014 wang et al 2015 thus desorption of mo from spm results in the release of isotopically light mo whereas adsorption of aqueous mo by spm results in scavenging of mo that is heavier than that in the spm but lighter than the mo of the fluid phase because of the preferential adsorption of isotopically light mo onto particle surfaces barling and anbar 2004 goldberg et al 2009 continuous inputs of spm and spatial variations in the physical and chemical conditions of the estuary create conditions favorable to strong isotopic fractionations aqueous mo isotopic compositions are influenced by the mo isotopic composition of spm as well as the degree of mo exchange between the fluid and solid phases for the yangtze estuary riverine spm has a δ98mo value of 0 0 fig 2 and the mo isotopic compositions shown in fig 8 are associated with a maximum exchange ratio of 45 near the estuary mouth 7 conclusions analysis of spatial variation in mo concentrations and isotopic compositions of waters and suspended particulate matter spm in the yangtze estuary and the adjacent east china sea shelf provides new insights into processes and rates of mo cycling in estuarine systems although mixing zone waters show a near linear relationship of mo concentrations to salinity the δ98mo of estuary waters deviates strongly from a conservative two component i e freshwater seawater mixing model the δ98mo anomaly is consistent with exchange of isotopically light mo in spm with isotopically heavy mo in mixing zone waters and the linear relationship between aqueous mo concentrations and salinity as well as the invariant mo concentrations in spm fig 6d e imply similar rates of mo adsorption and desorption on spm spm exhibits a significant increase in δ98mo oceanward as a result of these processes quantitative relationships among these variables based on a reaction transport model phreeqc provided constraints on rates of mo exchange although uncertainties related to anthropogenic and submarine groundwater inputs exist our results provide the most complete mo budget for the yangtze estuary to date and offers new insights regarding mo fluxes and processes within estuarine systems credit authorship contribution statement qian wang data curation formal analysis investigation methodology writing

4771,rivers are the main source of molybdenum mo to the oceans and estuaries represent an important interface between rivers and oceans within which mo can be sequestered or isotopically fractionated determining the behavior of mo in estuaries is thus essential for a full understanding of the global mo cycle here we present a case study of the modern yangtze estuary and adjacent east china sea shelf generating mo concentration and isotopic data for both aqueous and solid phases i e suspended particulate matter or spm primarily consisting of clay minerals and al fe mn oxides aqueous mo concentrations increase rapidly from 13 9 nm river water to 115 nm seawater through the mixing zone of the innermost continental shelf minor deviations from a salinity based mixing relationship positive at 22 psu to negative at 22 34 psu indicate a shift from net desorption to net adsorption of mo on spm with increasing salinity aqueous δ98mo values increase rapidly within the mixing zone from 1 15 river water to 2 3 seawater whereas the δ98mo of spm exhibits a smaller increase in the oceanward direction from 0 25 to 0 27 aqueous δ98mo exhibits large negative deviations from a simple two component i e freshwater seawater mixing model due to operation of an additional process inferred to be mo exchange between the fluid and solid phases simulations using a reaction transport model phreeqc demonstrated that a combination of two processes i e freshwater seawater mixing and fluid solid mo exchange can account for observed patterns of mo concentrations and isotopes in the yangtze estuary the results of this study thus provide valuable insights into mo cycling in estuarine systems and indispensable quantitative data for global mo budgets keywords mo isotope ionic exchange

the heavy isotopes of mo fractionation of mo isotopes occurs under certain conditions uptake by clay minerals and al fe mn oxy hydroxides results in preferential adsorption of lighter mo isotopes on particle surfaces goldberg et al 1996 2009 goldberg and forster 1998 barling and anbar 2004 wasylenki et al 2008 in natural systems the largest fractionation 98mosediment seawater 3 0 occurs during mo adsorption onto mn oxides in oxic seawater a process that has a weak dependence on temperature and ionic strength barling et al 2001 siebert et al 2003 barling and anbar 2004 wasylenki et al 2008 in addition biological processes can result in preferential uptake of light mo isotopes due to active microbial assimilation or adsorption onto cell surfaces liermann et al 2005 wasylenki et al 2007 zerkle et al 2011 the fractionation of mo adsorbed onto sedimentary organic matter is similar in magnitude and direction to that during uptake by fe mn oxy hydroxides king et al 2018 mo reacts with h2s in anoxic aqueous solutions to form thiomolybdates following the reaction series moo4 2 moo3s2 moo2s2 2 moos3 2 mos4 2 in which a large mo isotope fractionation occurs at each step tossell 2005 kendall et al 2017 thus changes in the fractional burial flux of mo to anoxic facies can influence global seawater δ98mo barling et al 2001 siebert et al 2003 in euxinic facies molybdate moo4 2 is converted to trithiomolybdate moos3 2 and tetrathiomolybdate mos4 2 where h2s aq exceeds a geochemical switchpoint at 11 µm resulting in near quantitative removal of aqueous mo to the sediment saxena et al 1968 diemann and muller 1973 erickson and helz 2000 kendall et al 2017 little to no fractionation of mo isotopes occurs during near quantitative removal of mo to the sediment as is common in strongly euxinic facies characterized by black shale deposition barling et al 2001 siebert et al 2003 cycling of mo in estuarine systems has been investigated only sporadically to date yielding evidence of both conservative and non conservative behavior see section 2 additional studies of mo cycling in estuaries are needed in order to document the range of natural variation in such systems furthermore although exchange of materials occurs between aqueous and solid phases in many estuaries morris et al 1978 sholkovitz 1995 lawrence and kamber 2006 the dynamic exchange of mo has not been documented in any estuarine system to date here we investigate the geochemical behavior of mo in the modern yangtze estuary and waters of the adjacent east china sea shelf based on mo concentration and isotopic data for both waters and spm in order to quantitatively constrain the dynamic exchange of mo we utilized an aqueous reaction transport model phreeqc to simulate observed patterns of variation in mo concentrations and isotopic compositions across the study area this study thus provides new information linking the terrestrial and marine mo reservoirs allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of mo cycling and quantification of global mo budgets 2 molybdenum behavior in estuarine systems an estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of water that is either permanently or episodically open to the sea and that receives at least periodic discharge from a river its salinity is thus less than that of seawater and decreases upchannel toward the riverine source potter et al 2010 estuaries represent transition zones in which rapid spatial and temporal variations in geochemical biological and sedimentological characteristics occur dalai et al 2005 dellwig et al 2007 pearce et al 2010 rahaman et al 2010 2014 within many estuaries strong exchange of materials between waters and spm linked to adsorption desorption reactions is known to occur especially under low brackish conditions salinity 10 psu practical salinity units morris et al 1978 sholkovitz 1995 lawrence and kamber 2006 molybdenum mo commonly exhibits conservative behavior during river water seawater mixing within estuaries with no significant effects linked to scavenging or remobilization this type of behavior can be inferred when mo concentrations show a linear relationship to salinity and δ98mo covaries linearly with 1 mo this pattern has been documented for waters of the rhine weser and elbe estuaries of germany schneider et al 2016 the itchen estuary of southeastern england archer and vance 2008 and the borgarfjörður estuary of norway pearce et al 2010 non conservative behavior of mo in estuarine mixing zones is recognized by deviations in mo concentrations and or isotopic compositions from a linear trend pearce et al 2010 rahaman et al 2010 2014 for example in the chao phraya estuary of thailand dissolved mo concentrations were much higher than expected for a simple mixing process at salinities of 5 psu dalai et al 2005 the excess mo in mixing zone waters was generated through release from spm or reductive remobilization of mo from estuary floor sediments during suboxic diagenesis on the other hand the hooghly and mandovi estuaries of india which contain dense mangrove swamps exhibited depletion of aqueous mo within the mixing zone relative to a simple mixing process rahaman et al 2010 mo loss was attributed to a combination of complexation with organic matter and removal to particulate aggregates undergoing decay or to reducing sediments on the estuary floor more complexly in the narmada estuary of india mo exhibits conservative behavior during the dry season but distinctly non conservative behavior during the monsoon season when release of isotopically light mo from fe mn oxyhydroxide particulates results in lower than normal δ98mo within the mixing zone rahaman et al 2014 non conservative mo behavior in estuaries may also be due to additional sources of mo such as anthropogenic inputs from agricultural fertilizer shipping and industrial waste water or submarine groundwater discharge dalai et al 2005 pearce et al 2010 gu et al 2012 yin et al 2015 wang et al 2016 gurumurthy et al 2017 king and pett ridge 2018 liu et al 2018 2019 in the tapi estuary of india unusually high dissolved mo concentrations and deviations of mo isotopes from a linear trend were attributed to anthropogenic influences as this watershed contains major steel and lime industries rahaman et al 2010 2014 all of these factors can influence mo budget calculations based on observational data rahaman et al 2014 further studies of the behavior of mo and its isotopes in estuarine systems are necessary in order to better constrain global mo cycling and to more confidently apply mo isotope proxies to paleoenvironmental analysis 3 study area the yangtze river has a total length of 6300 km from its source in the tibetan plateau to its mouth near shanghai where it flows into the east china sea its drainage basin occupies an area of 1 81 106 km2 at 25 35 n and 91 122 e chen et al 2001 yang et al 2006 ding et al 2014 its annual discharge of 1 1012 m3 is the third greatest of any river globally and it carries 4 14 108 tons of sediment to the ocean each year cwrc 2008 ding et al 2014 most of its drainage basin is situated in a subtropical monsoon region which has annual precipitation ranging from 800 to 1600 mm ding et al 2013 the monsoonal climate results in elevated water and sediment discharge during the wet season from may to october 70 of the annual total and reduced discharge during the dry season from november to april yang et al 2002 xu and milliman 2009 hu et al 2009 luo et al 2012 the average flow rate at datong located 600 km upstream from the river s mouth was 20 800 m3 s in march 2015 data from the web of hydrological information for chinese rivers http xxzx mwr gov cn which is nearly the same as at xuliujing in the upper yangtze estuary tang et al 2011 the temperature of yangtze river water decreases upstream but averages 16 18 c throughout the middle and lower river basin ding et al 2013 the yangtze estuary which is mesotidal with a mean tidal range of 2 3 m is 120 km long and 90 km wide at the river mouth wang and liu 2003 hu et al 2009 it is divided into deltaic distributary channels below xuliujing including the north branch north passage north channel and south channel by the islands of chongming changxing hengsha and jiuduansha the present study follows the main navigation channel south channel which has stronger discharge and lower watermass salinity than the other channels fig 1 zhang et al 2012 as the river enters the estuary unidirectional riverine flow yields to bidirectional tidal flow kundu and cohen 2004 geyer and maccready 2014 de souza machado et al 2016 the tidal signal can reach upchannel as far as datong 600 km from the estuary mouth in the dry season but is limited to downstream stations i e less than 350 km from the estuary mouth in the wet season fig 1 zhang et al 2018 the entire estuary and adjacent continental shelf are influenced by river runoff and tides and their co equal strength during flood tides is a major driver of watermass mixing in the outer estuary yu and zhang 2017 in the south channel spm generally increases in concentration from xuliujing to the estuary mouth with an upchannel downchannel shift in spm during summer winter related to seasonal variations in river discharge chen et al 2004 the turbidity maximum zone tmz where spm concentrations 70 mg l are greatest is co extant with the outer estuary to innermost east china sea shelf shen et al 1992 jiang et al 2013 in addition to its complicated topography human activity is another influence on the chemical and physical dynamics of the yangtze estuary the nearby megacity of shanghai with its large scale shipping and manufacturing activities affects metal concentrations and their distribution processes yin et al 2015 for example mo containing alloy steel and iron is used in shipbuilding drilling energy generation including boilers steam turbines and electricity generators and chemical and petrochemical processing imoa human sources such as agricultural fertilizer marine transport discharge and smelter factory waste contribute heavy metals to the yangtze estuary yin et al 2015 liu et al 2019 although these contributions have not been adequately quantified to date because of the lack of quantitative data for anthropogenic mo sources we will not incorporate them explicitly in our modeling or subsequent analysis 4 materials and methods 4 1 sampling samples for this study were collected along an oceanward to landward transect on march 13 15 2015 as part of the scientific investigation of the yangtze estuary project of the national natural science foundation of china voyage id norc2015 03 in 2015 the freshwater discharge from yangtze river to the estuary was higher than average for the wet season 80 from april to september relative to the dry season 20 from october to march liu et al 2018 water age defined as the time that a unit of water has spent within the estuarine system is 11 7 3 0 days in the dry season based on modeling of 224ra 223ra activity data liu et al 2018 hence water compositional variations related to the 3 day sampling period of the present study are unlikely to be consequential during the research cruise the river s ambient physical and chemical conditions were monitored through measurements of ph salinity and concentrations of spm water samples were collected from the inner and outer estuary c1 c8 the mixing zone a6 1 to a6 7 and the east china sea shelf a6 8 to a6 11 note samples a6 6 a6 8 and a6 10 are not reported below because they were not analyzed at each station except for a6 1 water samples were collected from the surface 0 m middle 4 5 28 m and lower 5 53 m layers of the river continental shelf watermass fig 1 table 1 water samples were collected in pre cleaned high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate filters by shz d iii shb 3 water circulating vacuum pump on field the filtered water samples representing the fluid phase were acidified to ph 2 5 using double sub boiling distillation concentrated hno3 for storage the spm was separated from the fluid phase during the filtering process and rinsed with high purity deionized milli q water diw to leach salts the filters with spm were dried at 45 for 30 minutes in an electrothermal constant temperature drying oven and then stored in a freezer prior to analysis 4 2 geochemical analyses elemental concentrations were analyzed using an agilent technologies 7700 series inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms in the state key laboratory of geological processes and mineral resources gpmr of the china university of geosciences cug wuhan china high salinity water samples were usually diluted to suitable concentrations with 2 hno3 and an internal standard in before analysis about 50 mg of each spm sample were digested in teflon bombs with 3 ml acid a 1 1 mixture of concentrated hno3 and hf at 190 c for 48 h the digested spm sample solutions were then evaporated to dryness and redissolved in 3 ml of acid being a 1 1 1 mixture of concentrated hno3 diw and 1 ppm indium at 190 c for 12 h a further dilution with 2 hno3 to a suitable volume was carried out for the final analysis the icp ms internal precision was generally better than 3 and the precision of duplicates was better than 5 for most elements the analytical detection limit was 1 nm for mo and 2 nm for fe and mn cf centineo et al 2011 mineralogic compositions of the spm were determined by x ray diffraction xrd using an x pert prody2198 at the gpmr the spm samples were scraped gently from filters suspended in ultrapure water and pipetted on glass slides before analysis xrd patterns were recorded at a scanning speed of 0 418 s using cu kα radiation 40 ma and 40 kv peak identification was based on a clay mineral catalog mo isotope purification was carried out under class 100 laboratory conditions all acids were purified by double sub boiling distillation in teflon stills and the labware was cleaned in concentrated reagent grade acids and diw prior to use about 250 ml of low salinity water samples c1 to c8 or about 30 ml of high salinity water samples a6 1 to a6 11 were evaporated with addition of a 97mo 100mo double spike the spm samples with 97mo 100mo double spike were digested in teflon bombs with 3 ml acid a 1 1 mixture of concentrated hno3 and hf at 190 c for 48 h after these pretreatments a 7 m hcl with 0 03 h2o2 was used to dissolve samples prior to column separations which followed a modified protocol from siebert et al 2006 the anion exchange resin ag mp 1m bio rad 100 200 mesh was used to separate mo from analytes causing isobaric interferences e g zr and ru and polyatomic interferences caused by matrix elements e g k na ca mg and fe and then a cation exchange resin ag 50w x8 bio rad 200 400 mesh was used to further separate mo from the remaining fe zhou et al 2012 2016 cheng et al 2016 the purified mo samples were diluted in 5 hno3 prior to measurement using a neptune plus thermo finnigan scientific bremen germany multi collector icp ms at gpmr wuhan china the mo isotope compositions in this study are reported relative to the johnson matthey company jmc mo standard solution lot 602332b siebert et

comparison with other studies delta per mille notation for the mo isotope ratio is defined as δ98mo 98mo 95mo sample 98mo 95mo jmc 1 1000 the mo isotope compositions of modern seawater and usgs reference agv 2 relative to the jmc standard are 2 30 0 03 2sd n 3 and 0 11 0 06 2sd n 3 respectively which are in good agreement with previous reported values goldberg et al 2013 nägler et al 2014 willbold et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 kendall et al 2017 the reproducibility of the measured δ98mo ratios is better than 0 06 4 3 reaction transport modeling in order to better understand controls on mo within the yangtze estuary an aqueous reaction batch and transport model was coded using phreeqc phreeqc version 3 is a computer program written in the c and c programming languages that is designed for simulation of chemical reactions and transport processes in natural waters laboratory experiments and industrial processes appelo and postma 2005 parkhurst and appelo 2013 it is applicable to many hydrogeochemical processes such as mixing of waters the action of irreversible reactions in solutions dissolving and precipitating phases to achieve equilibrium with the aqueous medium and the effects of temperature variation each simulation includes a database file an input file and an output file phreeqc contains a series of thermodynamic database equations that can be extended or modified to make the simulation more accurately reflect actual conditions the setup for the code of an input file is important for the simulation of a phreeqc model see supplement for full details of the reaction transport model our phreeqc simulations modeled river flow into a marine watermass resulting in progressive mixing of freshwater and seawater the model simulated one dimensional transport of water including advection dispersion and diffusion processes advection was modeled by using average river velocity which is 0 2 0 5 m s local history of shanghai 2008 reactions between fluid and solid phases were influenced by physical and chemical conditions of the mixed watermass including ph and salinity as well as by ionic exchange with spm the concentration and isotopic composition of mo were calculated for each aqueous and solid phase at every grid cell the model boundary conditions included defined chemical compositions of the freshwater and seawater endmembers and the solid surface parameters of each station based on measured data freshwater discharge and dispersivity values were tuned to achieve an optimal match between simulated and observed mo concentrations the exchange ratios of mo between fluid and solid phases yielded by this model will be discussed in section 6 4 5 results the geochemical data and δ98mo results for this study are given in table 1 the salinity of the water samples ranged from 0 16 psu for the freshwater endmember to 34 psu for the seawater endmember the latter value corresponding to a reported salinity of 33 9 psu in the east china sea delcroix and murtugudde 2002 the ph of the yangtze estuary and waters of the adjacent east china sea shelf varied from 7 10 for the freshwater endmember to 8 10 for the seawater endmember the mineral compositions of spm are given in supplementary table s1 which mainly consist of clay minerals and quartz with smaller amounts of feldspar calcite and dolomite dissolved mo concentrations range from 11 8 nm for the freshwater endmember to 118 nm for the seawater endmember with a small bulge positive anomaly at station c7 fig 2 that may be associated with dump site 1 of oceanic dredged materials fig 1 the mo concentration of the seawater endmember of this study is consistent with that of average global seawater 110 10 nm morris 1975 quinby hunt and turekian 1983 collier 1985 rahaman et al 2014 the spm exhibits mo concentrations ranging from 0 63 to 1 98 μg g δ98mo for the fluid phase ranges from 1 08 to 2 39 with strongly rising values down channel of station a6 1 122 06 e and relatively uniform high values oceanward of station a6 9 123 50 e fig 2 the δ98mo of the freshwater endmember falls within the range of reported modern fluvial values 0 28 to 2 40 archer and vance 2008 pearce et al 2010 neubert et al 2011 voegelin et al 2012 wang et al 2015 king and pett ridge 2018 and the δ98mo of the seawater endmember is consistent with that of global seawater 2 34 0 10 barling et al 2001 siebert et al 2003 nakagawa et al 2012 kendall et al 2017 at each station except for a6 1 water samples were taken from three depths within the river i e the surface middle and lower layers but these samples yielded nearly identical values at each station with no systematic variation as a function of water depth reflecting vertical homogenization of mo isotopes within the fluvial water column fig 2 for this reason we averaged the measured δ98mo of samples taken from three different depths at each station and these average values were then used for analysis of lateral variation of mo isotopes the spm exhibits relatively lower δ98mo values 0 25 to 0 27 and is more spatially variable two samples exhibit low values before station a6 1 122 06 e downchannel of which values rise steadily fig 2 relative to the water sample from the same station the δ98mo of spm is on average about 1 2 depleted in the western upchannel part of the transect and about 1 9 depleted at its eastern oceanward end 6 discussion 6 1 behavior of mo during estuarine mixing 6 1 1 relationship between mo concentrations and δ98mo of estuary waters the theoretical mixing model of freshwater and seawater was calculated using equations from faure and mensing 2005 chapter 16 1 f a a a b where a and b are the weights of these components and fa represents the abundances of component a in a mixture of a and b 2 c m c a f a c b 1 f a where cm concentration of mo in the mixture m ca cb concentrations of mo in components a and b 3 δ m δ a f a c a c m δ b 1 f a c b c m where δm mo isotopic composition of a mixture m δa δb mo isotopic compositions of components a and b for simple two component systems conservative mixing always yields a straight line relationship on a δm vs 1 cm crossplot fig 3 faure and mensing 2005 in our model simulations the composition of the freshwater endmember was based on data from station c6 mo 16 4 nm δ98mo 1 13 and the seawater endmember on published values of 110 10 nm and 2 3 morris 1975 quinby hunt and turekian 1983 collier 1985 rahaman et al 2014 kendall et al 2017 relative to the expected linear relationship of δ98mo to 1 mo for a conservative two component mixing system fig 3 our dataset reveals a large negative anomaly for yangtze estuary waters this anomaly is indicative of the addition of isotopically light mo to and or loss of isotopically heavy mo from the fluid phase within the mixing zone a slight positive correlation between δ98mo and 1 mo was found in the low salinity zone c1 c8 fig 3 see section 6 3 for further discussion 6 1 2 relationship between mo concentrations and salinity of estuary waters in earlier mixing experiments between freshwater and seawater mo displayed largely conservative behavior with only minor anomalies related to mixing at intermediate salinities schneider et al 2016 in the study of head and burton 1970 mo concentrations and salinities yielded a linear relationship proving that fluid mixing was the main process influencing the distribution of mo in the southampton water i e the estuary at the mouths of rivers test and itchen in contrast small deviations of mo concentrations from the salinity based mixing relationship positive at 22 psu and negative at 22 34 psu were exhibited in the yangtze estuary and its adjacent waters fig 4 which will be discussed in section 6 3 active desorption and adsorption processes must be invoked to account for non conservative mo behavior in the yangtze estuary and its adjacent waters figs 3 and 4 the release of isotopically light mo from spm and groundwater discharge can potentially contribute dissolved mo to estuary waters dalai et al 2005 pearce et al 2010 concurrently adsorption of mo onto al fe mn oxyhydroxides or organic matter or uptake into reducing sediments can remove dissolved mo from the water column goldberg et al 1996 2009 goldberg and forster 1998 barling and anbar 2004 wasylenki et al 2008 rahaman et al 2014 wang et al 2016 all of these processes can lead to fractionation of mo isotopes within the estuarine system given that the fresh groundwater flux into the yangtze estuary is estimated to be just 3 of the yangtze river discharge during the dry season liu et al 2018 and the mo concentrations of the groundwater and river water are similar king et al 2016 neely et al 2018 the influence of groundwater on mo cycling in the yangtze estuary can be regarded as insignificant and groundwater fluxes will not be considered in the following analysis 6 2 mass balance modeling of mo behavior mo in the yangtze estuary and its adjacent water samples was analytically separated into fluid and solid spm phases the spm consists of a mixture of river borne particles and resuspended sediments and it is composed of clay minerals clastic silicates carbonate minerals fe oxyhydr oxides and organic compounds supplementary table s1 dalai et al 2005 ding et al 2013 2014 none of these phases contains significant primary mo and most or all of the mo in the spm is present in adsorbed form on clay minerals fe oxyhydr oxides and or organic materials a simple mass balance model was used to explore the interaction of mo between spm and estuary waters without considering the effects of river flow and rates of mo exchange exchange of mo between spm δ98mo 0 25 to 0 27 and waters δ98mo 1 08 to 2 39 is expected to result in higher δ98mo values for the former and lower values for the latter relative to the freshwater seawater mixed fluid endmember fig 5 the measured δ98mo of spm in the yangtze estuary and its adjacent waters has a narrow range around 0 0 similar to the average δ98mo of the bulk silicate earth δ98mo 0 04 0 12 greber et al 2015 according to the magnitude of δ98mo anomalies i e the deviations between measured fluid δ98mo and the theoretical two component fluid mixing model fig 3 we infer that the degree of exchange of mo between the fluid and spm increases from the upchannel end of the mixing zone to roughly its midpoint and thereafter decreases in the oceanward direction interactions between the fluid and spm lead to release of isotopically light mo 0 0 from spm to estuary waters as well as scavenging of isotopically heavy mo from the water column onto spm a three component mass balance model incorporating mo exchange between estuary waters representing a mixture of freshwater and seawater and spm can be calculated as follows 4 δ e δ m 1 f e δ spm f e where δe mo isotopic composition after exchange δm mo isotopic composition of the fluid at a given station based on the two component fluid mixing model of eq 3 δspm initial δ98mo of spm 0 0 and fe exchange ratio which is the ratio of soluble mo concentrations derived from spm to total dissolved mo concentrations three different degrees of mo exchange between spm and the estuarine watermass were modeled 20 weak 40 moderate and 80 strong these values represent the fractional amount of mo in the estuarine watermass at a given station that was derived from spm a δ98mo vs 1 mo crossplot fig 5 shows strong correspondence between the measured δ98mo values of the fluid and the moderate exchange curve this result suggests that mo exchange between fluid and spm has significantly influenced mo isotopic compositions across the study area 6 3 adsorption desorption of mo onto spm suspended particulate matter spm is expected to have a wide range of surface chemical properties and trace metal adsorption characteristics hatje et al 2003 it tends to preferentially adsorb mo with isotopically light signatures from the water column goldberg et al 1996 2009 goldberg and forster 1998 barling and anbar 2004 wasylenki et al 2008 mo with an isotopically light composition may be released from spm in estuaries due to a change in physical or chemical conditions pearce et al 2010 molybdenum adsorption onto spm phases is enhanced at low ph and diminishes at higher ph values 1 for clay minerals adsorption is maximized at ph 3 and declines to near zero at ph 7 and 2 for al and fe oxides adsorption is maximized at ph 4 and declines to near zero at ph 8 goldberg et al 1996 goldberg and forster 1998 in addition molybdenum adsorption onto mn oxides decreases from 99 at ph 6 5 to 70 at ph 8 5 barling and anbar 2004 therefore the mo adsorption capacity of spm is weak in watermasses with near marine ph including the modern yangtze estuary and its adjacent waters ph 7 1 8 1 the mn and fe concentrations of spm decline steadily along the study transect except for small increases at the estuarine shelf transition fig 6 b c reflecting a near continuous release of these elements to estuary waters in contrast the mo concentrations of spm are spatially variable first decreasing from station c1 to c8 then remaining unchanged at stations a6 1 to a6 7 and finally increasing slightly from station a6 7 to a6 11 fig 6a it is possible that mo undergoes simultaneous adsorption and desorption on spm throughout the estuary although with some spatial variation in the relative intensities of these processes relative to a two component freshwater seawater mixed fluid the higher than expected mo concentrations in low salinity water samples c1 c8 indicate relatively stronger release of mo from spm fig 6e cf zhang et al 2008 and the lower than expected mo concentrations in high salinity water samples a6 7 a6 11 indicate relatively stronger adsorption of mo onto spm fig 6e the positive relationships of mo with mn fig 7 a and mo with fe fig 7b in the low salinity samples suggest that the desorbed mo was associated with mn oxides and or fe oxyhydroxides the former may have played a larger role given that the relationship of mo with mn r 0 79 p 0 01 n 24 fig 7a is far stronger than that with fe r 0 28 p 0 18 n 24 fig 7b desorption sourced mo in the low salinity zone results in a weak positive correlation of δ98mo with 1 mo as shown in fig 3 the slight oceanward increase of δ98mo in the spm fig 2 is interpreted as the product of exchange of isotopically light mo in spm with isotopically heavy mo in mixing zone waters 6 4 reaction transport modeling of mo behavior the mass balance model in section 6 2 although capable of closely matching our measured data fig 5 cannot account for dynamic mixing processes such as advection through bulk movement of river flow dispersion and rate dependent processes such as mo exchange between the watermass and spm for this purpose phreeqc was used to simulate one dimensional water flow and reaction rates of mo between spm and estuary waters we discuss the results of these simulations below remobilization of sediment from the channel or shelf floor occurs readily in the tmz exchange ratio 80 based on sediment budget liu et al 2010 due to strong river and tidal flow however the sediment exchange ratio between the water column i e spm and the channel or shelf floor for sites outside of the tmz is much smaller 10 liu et al 2010 about 49 of the riverine spm is deposited in the tmz liu et al 2010 trace elements adsorbed onto particles are likely to be released during resuspension due to desorption of weakly bound metals from particulate surfaces hatje et al 2003 therefore the reversible mo interactions between spm and estuary waters are likely to occur in the yangtze estuary and its adjacent waters due to continuous inputs of spm resuspension of bottom sediments and varying physico chemical conditions in the mixing zone on a global scale fluvial suspended particulates contain 4 8 wt total fe including 2 wt as fe oxyhydr oxides martin and meybeck 1979 poulton and raiswell 2002 but only 0 1 wt total mn martin and meybeck 1979 with 0 08 wt as mn oxides canfield 1997 thamdrup 2000 in addition fe oxyhydr oxides and mn oxides have co equal affinity for molybdate under similar ph and ionic concentration conditions balistrieri and chao 1990 considering that the relationships of fe mo and mn mo of spm at stations a6 1 to a6 11 are similar fe mo r 0 50 p 0 01 n 24 mn mo r 0 50 p 0 01 n 24 and that fe oxyhydr oxides are more abundant than mn oxides in spm we assumed that the reactions of mo linked to spm on the inner continental shelf are mainly controlled by fe oxyhydr oxides the surface reactions between fe oxyhydr oxides and molybdate ions in the phreeqc input file were defined hydrous ferric oxides hfo were used as surface binding species which include strong binding sites hfo s and weak binding sites hfo w since the heterogeneities of mineral surfaces dzombak and morel 1990 the ratio of strong to weak sites was set at 1 40 parkhurst and appelo 2013 the reaction formulas of mo on surfaces were cited from the database minteq v4 dat in phreeqc see the supplement for details the amounts of surface binding sites were calculated using the spm concentrations and fe concentrations of spm from stations c6 to a6 11 the surface site density μmol m2 and the surface area m2 g maximum and minimum values were estimated from the literature the surface area for hfo averages about 600 m2 g dzombak and morel 1990 with a range of 200 800 m2 g based on values for goethite and ferrihydrite eusterhues et al 2005 the site density of hfo has a value of 3 83 μmol m2 0 094 for strong sites 3 74 for weak sites for the two site model dzombak and morel 1990 and 16 6 μmol m2 for the one site model sverjensky and sahai 1996 without attempting to account for specific mineral and binding site types these values give an indication of general particle surface parameters the total concentration of surface binding sites can be calculated as follows van benthem 2015 5 hfo tot a s c n s where hfo tot represents the total concentration of surface binding sites per volume solution as is the specific surface area in m2 g c is the concentration of spm in g l and ns is the surface site density in μmol m2 after model parameterization we simulated one dimensional 1d transport of river water flowing into seawater accompanied by mo exchange between spm and the fluid phase because station c7 may have been polluted by dump site 1 within a small radius around that point source station c6 and station a6 11 were chosen to represent the freshwater and seawater endmembers of the model respectively and the average elemental concentrations and ph values of each station i e the mean of its three vertical measurements were calculated distances between adjacent stations were calculated to establish the transport cell dimensions of the model the flow rate of the yangtze estuary was 0 2 0 5 m s local history of shanghai 2008 which was applied in the transport process of phreeqc model see the supplement for details different combinations of the hfo parameters were adopted as initial conditions for a set of model simulations and these were adjusted iteratively to achieve the best match of dissolved mo concentrations to our data observations the exchange ratio of mo i e the proportion of total dissolved mo derived from spm at each station was calculated using phreeqc the measured salinity of each station was used to calculate the proportion of freshwater in each aqueous sample which was then substituted into eqs 2 and 3 to calculate the δ98mo based on a simple two component mixing model with a freshwater endmember c6 mo 16 4 nm δ98mo 1 13 salinity 0 19 psu and a seawater endmember a6 11 mo 115 nm δ98mo 2 3 salinity 34 psu since no thermodynamic information is available for mo isotopes the phreeqc model was unable to simulate mo fractionation during transport which however can be calculated from eq 4 using the spm endmember with a δ98mo value of 0 0 the preceding δ98mo of the fluid phase based on a simple two component mixing model and the exchange ratios acquired from phreeqc the final results represent the δ98mo of estuary waters after mixing freshwater seawater and exchange with spm in the yangtze estuary and its adjacent waters fig 8 the δ98mo of estuary waters calculated by the exchange ratios acquired from phreeqc matched our measured data from the mixing zone well when the site density is 3 83 μmol m2 or 16 6 μmol m2 which showed insignificant variations for a modest range of surface areas 200 800 m2 g fig 8 thus these simulations matched the measured data well indicating that the behavior of mo in the mixing zone of the yangtze estuary is controlled by both mixing of freshwater and seawater and intense mo exchange between estuary waters and spm the good match between data observations and the phreeqc model results fig 8 indicates that the fractionation of dissolved mo is likely to be controlled by the mixing of freshwater and seawater and mo exchange reactions between spm and estuary waters within the mixing zone with regard to mo associated with spm desorption dominates over adsorption in the low salinity zone of the inner estuary whereas adsorption dominates over desorption in the near marine salinity zone of the east china sea these desorption adsorption reactions have little effect on aqueous mo concentrations due to the relatively small amounts of exchangeable mo in spm relative to mo in the water column however repeated cycling of mo between spm and estuary waters can have a significant effect on aqueous mo isotopic compositions cf rahaman et al 2014 previous studies have shown that river waters have relatively higher δ98mo values than spm voegelin et al 2012 rahaman et al 2014 wang et al 2015 thus desorption of mo from spm results in the release of isotopically light mo whereas adsorption of aqueous mo by spm results in scavenging of mo that is heavier than that in the spm but lighter than the mo of the fluid phase because of the preferential adsorption of isotopically light mo onto particle surfaces barling and anbar 2004 goldberg et al 2009 continuous inputs of spm and spatial variations in the physical and chemical conditions of the estuary create conditions favorable to strong isotopic fractionations aqueous mo isotopic compositions are influenced by the mo isotopic composition of spm as well as the degree of mo exchange between the fluid and solid phases for the yangtze estuary riverine spm has a δ98mo value of 0 0 fig 2 and the mo isotopic compositions shown in fig 8 are associated with a maximum exchange ratio of 45 near the estuary mouth 7 conclusions analysis of spatial variation in mo concentrations and isotopic compositions of waters and suspended particulate matter spm in the yangtze estuary and the adjacent east china sea shelf provides new insights into processes and rates of mo cycling in estuarine systems although mixing zone waters show a near linear relationship of mo concentrations to salinity the δ98mo of estuary waters deviates strongly from a conservative two component i e freshwater seawater mixing model the δ98mo anomaly is consistent with exchange of isotopically light mo in spm with isotopically heavy mo in mixing zone waters and the linear relationship between aqueous mo concentrations and salinity as well as the invariant mo concentrations in spm fig 6d e imply similar rates of mo adsorption and desorption on spm spm exhibits a significant increase in δ98mo oceanward as a result of these processes quantitative relationships among these variables based on a reaction transport model phreeqc provided constraints on rates of mo exchange although uncertainties related to anthropogenic and submarine groundwater inputs exist our results provide the most complete mo budget for the yangtze estuary to date and offers new insights regarding mo fluxes and processes within estuarine systems credit authorship contribution statement qian wang data curation formal analysis investigation methodology writing

renwick et al 2006 estimated that there are approximately 2 6 to 9 million constructed basins despite the relatively smaller volume area and depth of stormwater management basins compared to major water infrastructure such as constructed reservoirs such basins significantly outnumber and also intercept approximately 25 of the runoff in the usa with potential benefit to the hydrologic cycle the environs and human health renwick et al 2006 while clarification basins wet retention has been implemented and promulgated by regulatory stakeholders as part of urban suburban land development or through re development or infrastructure retrofit plans for over a half century renwick et al 2006 spelman and sansalone 2018 united states environmental protection agency 2002 the elucidation of the transport fate processes within basins as driven by basin hydrodynamics remains limited and challenging chemical and pathogen transport fate notwithstanding a primary challenge is the transport fate of pm loading subject to unsteady and continuous hydrology noting that a heterodisperse particle size distribution psd is a primary vector for chemical and pathogen transport fate transport fate in a basin is coupled to and driven by the hydrodynamics generated from stochastic and episodic runoff loadings during a continuous time series of runoff loadings the basin residence time distribution rtd response can encompass multiple runoff event loadings driven by runoff induced pressure gradients and hydraulic stresses the internal basin hydrodynamic response and the coupled elution of pm can exhibit large variations spatially and temporally a heterodisperse and variable psd further complicates a description of pm transport fate within a basin kim and sansalone 2008 sansalone et al 1998 spelman and sansalone 2018 previous studies have illustrated these unsteadiness challenges and identified the importance of spatial and temporal phenomena in the examination of basin load response garofalo and sansalone 2011 shih et al 2017 spelman and sansalone 2017 spelman and sansalone 2018 krajewski et al 2017 current regulatory design and management guidance does not explicitly address such a dynamic intra basin and elution response to momentum transport decades of guidance has been based on empirical and lumped indices such as a 14 or 21 day residence time rt st johns river water management district 2018 harper and baker 2007 livingston et al 1988 camp dresser and mckee inc 1985 florida department of environmental protection 2020 since such indices cannot represent the dynamic intra basin and elution response to continuous time domain loadings these lumped models suffer from poor generalization and require higher level calibrations on a case by case basis hahn and özisik 2012 elliott and trowsdale 2007 chow et al 2010 wilcox 2006 krajewski et al 2017 for system design management and retrofits such lumped models that may implicitly infer mass volume continuity provide little guidance for the intra basin design and in particular retrofitting existing basins where spatial constraints do not permit spatial surface area and volume augmentation specifically momentum transport as described by the navier stokes set of equations is not applied to elucidate basin hydrodynamics krajewski et al 2017 huber et al 2006 chow et al 2010 commonly assumptions of uniform flow or a well mixed condition must be introduced to mathematically close the mass transport conservation equation for the analytical model chosen models such as a surface overflow rate sor model and continuously stirred tank reactors cstr spelman and sansalone 2018 huber et al 2006 hazen 1904 are generally applied subject to a steady flow although a sor model has been extended and validated for event based unsteady pm transport and fate ying and sansalone 2010 by neglecting momentum transport in these models the system behavior irrespective of spatial basin scale is typically estimated as a function of flowrate treatment volume and surface area harper and baker 2007 st johns river water management district 2018 for example the existing regulatory guidance of st johns river water management district 2018 requires the permanent pool of a wet basin to be dimensioned for a rt estimated as volume flowrate of at least 14 days during the wet season to achieve a presumptive basin performance of 80 consequently existing design methods and regulatory guidance cannot quantitatively differentiate design alternations such as spatial basin geometrics inlet out configurations and internal retrofits beyond qualitative guidance stamou et al 1989 adams and rodi 1990 while the current design and analytical tools are expeditious the existing methods do not allow for mechanistic insights into the in situ system behavior and cannot identify potential system behavior liabilities furthermore if a basin is not designed and examined to identify potential hydrodynamic short circuiting and dead zones the cost of retrofitting treatment behavior operations and maintenance can be impacted spelman and sansalone 2018 zhang et al 2014 with the goal of improving system hydraulic efficiency while reducing spatial requirements thereby improving the economics of basin construction several methods have been considered in the literature garofalo and sansalone 2018 howard et al 2011 liu and garcía 2011 zhang et al 2013 among these baffling has been widely applied in uop systems such as heat exchangers chlorine contact chambers and sedimentation clarifiers garofalo and sansalone 2018 fang et al 2015 shih et al 2017 compared with retrofitting a basin based on spatial augmentation and or inlet outlet re configuration retrofitting an existing basin with baffles or designing a basin initially with baffles is more flexible and has been shown to be more economical shih et al 2017 florida department of transportation 2010 florida department of transportation 2016 previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of impervious baffles through computational fluid dynamics cfd and bench scale physical modeling fang et al 2015 garofalo and sansalone 2018 kattnig and venayagamoorthy 2015 lyn and rodi 1990 while the cfd shows substantially improved predictive capability for various designs in comparison to lumped models liu and zhang 2019 sinha et al 2012 the role of in situ pervious baffling in a full scale clarification basin system under continuous time domain unsteady hydraulic loading has not been examined in comparison to conventional water and wastewater uop systems such as a primary clarifier or a chlorine contact chamber urban drainage basins are subject to episodic storm induced inflow these basins can have significant range of spatial scales for example on a surface area basis from less than 100 m 2 florida department of transportation 2010 to larger than 7000 m 2 renwick et al 2006 the subject basin of this study has a surface area of approximately 12 600 m 2 at normal water elevation depending on the interaction between basin geometrics watershed influent loadings and controls downgradient of the basin the basin hydrodynamics and transport phenomena are influenced by the continuous time domain hydraulic loads generated by multiple runoff events in which the time scale of elution process can range from hours to greater than a week fang et al 2015 shih et al 2017 spelman and sansalone 2017 single event based analysis potentially yields unrepresentative results and hence continuous physical monitoring or simulation is preferred over the entire continuous time domain elution process fang et al 2015 spelman and sansalone 2017 ahilan et al 2019 guan et al 2018 in addition as pointed out by spelman and sansalone 2018 who applied a stepwise steady cfd approach due to the large spatial and temporal scales cfd simulations of a basin system with the common approach of three dimensional 3d steady unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans urans model can result in higher computational expenses approximately 16 cpu days for rans thus there exists a practical need for a numerical model to allow for a design that considers hydrodynamic complexities at a reasonable computation outlay for example a workstation with 32 cores to overcome these computational constraints while preserving the generality of the model in this study the depth averaged unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equation also known as shallow water equation swe is adopted as the foundation of the cfd model development due to the computational efficiency the c framework of open source field operation and manipulation openfoam is utilized to parallelize model computations weller et al 1998 this study s overall objective is to develop and examine an swe based cfd model as a higher fidelity complementary tool for stormwater clarification basin design and retrofit compared to the existing presumptive criteria the central hypothesis of this study is that an swe based cfd model can overcome the limitation of presumptive criteria simulate turbulent transport fate process in basin systems and provide more accurate predictions of system performance under episodic hydraulic and constituent in this study as pm loadings while benefit from computational efficiency compared to 3d urans to attain the overall objective the following four specific objectives are pursued in this study the first objective elucidates the hydrodynamic and elution behavior of a permeable baffled basin subject to continuous time domain unsteady flows from august to september of 2014 through physical tracer monitoring and numerical simulations with the proposed cfd model based on the swe the second objective compares modeled results with measured data from the tracer study to evaluate the efficacy of both fully transient and quasi steady models a third objective examines the turbulence conditions within the basin to further elucidate the system hydrodynamics in terms of turbulent flow regimes the final objective compares responses of a series of design conditions with in situ baffling and permeable gabion baffles basin hydrodynamics and pm separation of these designs are compared through numerical simulation results for i pre retrofit ii as designed iii as built and iv impervious baffle conditions of the same basin bathymetry 2 material and methods the physically based data applied in this research were obtained from a monitoring campaign of a basin system at an airport in southwest florida apf in 2014 and 2015 the basin plan view configuration and bathymetry are shown in fig 1 the basin is 260 m in length north to south with a lateral dimension that varies from 40 to 86 m as shown in figs 1 and 2 twelve fully submerged permeable gabion baffles comprised of crushed carbonated reclaimed concrete crc were constructed along the lateral direction to train the flow pattern and increase flow tortuosity at the basin and baffle scale this basin system is an urban drainage basin which is loaded by airport and commercial land use runoff through a dendritic municipal storm sewer system ms4 that potentially receives intermittent dry weather discharges during a storm event there is inflow through four inflow conveyances two are located at the north n and northeast ne end of the basin and two are located along the east e and west w bank toward the basin s n end the outlet is a triple box culvert at the south s end of the basin and is directly hydraulically connected to another downstream basin where the effluent is eventually discharged into a tidally influenced channel through a combined orifice and weir outflow structure the monitored basin is subject to downstream tidal influences through the outflow structure the flowrate and water elevation at inlets and outlets were measured in real time by velocimeters and pressure transducers campbell scientific 2019a at a regular time interval as shown in fig 3 the 40 day mean flowrate for the ne n e and w inlets are 34 5 35 0 11 4 and 4 6 l s under the shorter term imbalance between the inflow generated by storm runoff and the outflow controlled by the orifice weir outflow structure at the outlet to the basin downstream of the subject basin the water elevation in the subject varies by as much as 0 5m

information on the background sampling equipment measurement protocols and data of the physical monitoring has been published elsewhere florida department of transportation 2016 2 1 model development the swe as applied herein is derived from the depth averaged unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equation the swe is often employed to simulate system hydrodynamics in water bodies from shallow channels to oceans canestrelli et al 2014 toro 2009 vreugdenhil 2013 in swe models the numerical solution is vertically averaged into a 2d computational grid with the further hydrostatic assumption solution of the pressure poisson equation as the most costly computational routine approximately 60 of the computational time in an incompressible navier stokes solver dodd and ferrante 2014 is avoided the overall computational efficiency of the swe is higher than a 3d rans model hinterberger et al 2007 navas montilla et al 2019 in this study the model employed is approximately 320 times faster than the 3d rans for a quasi steady simulation of a basin with a dimension of 260 86 3 m the shallow water assumption is generally considered to be valid when the horizontal scale is much more significant than the vertical scale horizontal vertical scale 5 adamsson 1999 benelmouffok and yu 2018 hinterberger et al 2007 persson et al 1999 shih et al 2017 ahilan et al 2019 guan et al 2018 as

basin between august and september 2014 to index the hydrodynamics of the in situ permeable baffle system subject to a continuous time domain of uncontrolled inflows a fluorescent dye rhodamine wt rwt solution vasudevan et al 2001 was injected at several inlets at different injection times during the study as shown in table 1 a calibrated fluorimeter hydrolab ms5 ott hydromet 2019 with a detection limit of 1 ppb and a 3 accuracy range specified for concentrations of 1 100 parts per billion ppb was installed at the approximate depth centroid of the center south outflow conveyance face and two meters in front of the face of this box culvert conveyance the injected quantity of the concentrated rwt solution 20 was established based on the estimated incoming flows dilution of the rwt within the basin and the detection range of the fluorimeter time interval measurements of 15 min were used for sampling the eluted rwt concentration from the basin by the fluorimeter the measurements were continued until the rwt concentration fell below the detection limit in the fully transient numerical simulation of the tracer eqs 1 3 are coupled and solved the measured hydrographs and water elevation were applied at the north end inflow and the south end outflow as shown in fig 3 the classic wet dry boundary condition for flooding simulations is not considered in this study because the water surface area changes due to water elevation changes in a stormwater clarification basin are typically minimal especially in the subject clarification basin in this study in which the vertical walls completely define the west boundary as indicated by the bathymetry contour in fig 1c the model was initialized from 17 august 2014 approximately 3 days before the first rwt injection to establish the initial hydrodynamic conditions bathymetry and wind stress are also considered in the model and characteristics of these basin conditions are shown in fig 1 through fig 3 for flows

operator in the non orthogonality grid jasak 1996 a computational grid size of 23000 is determined through the numerical convergence study as shown in fig s3 in the si while the fully transient model is evaluated with the field tracer study results a quasi steady simplification of the hydrographs are also examined in this study in the quasi steady simplified model instead of applying the observed unsteady hydrographs to the inlets the mean flowrate of the hydrographs over the period of the tracer study is used the flow momentum equations are then solved in a steady state mode once the flow field is converged momentum residuals 10 6 the flow momentum calculations are terminated and the tracer transport equation is solved as is the case for the fully transient model in addition to the permeable baffles the actual as built retrofit and as designed conditions as illustrated in fig 1 and 2 additional system configurations include a pre retrofit no baffle and impervious baffle configurations are also explored the pre retrofit condition represents the condition of the basin without baffles the as designed condition represents the original design configuration where the permeable baffles are fully extended into the banks of the subject basin the as built condition differs from the as design condition by that there exist gaps between the end of baffles and the east bank at high water levels the impervious baffle condition is identical to the as designed condition except the baffles are impervious and are not permeable baffles 2 3 particulate matter pm separation in the physical monitoring campaign of the basin 10 storm events were monitored from 12 september 2014 event 1 to 24 july 2015 event 10 with event based rainfall depths that ranged from 19 0 to 80 8 mm in total 599 inflow and 365 outflow samples were collected and analyzed for pm indices the pm indices were measured as suspended sediment concentration ssc total suspended solids tss and gravimetric particle size distribution psd the pm separation by the basin as integrated through the overall monitoring campaign is used as an index of the as built basin system response detailed laboratory analysis and field procedures are provided elsewhere florida department of transportation 2016 simulations of pm separation were carried out for the mean flow condition of the 10 monitored storm events the event mean flowrates of 9 90 4 46 49 8 and 37 5 l s were applied to e w ne and n inlets median values of the influent pm samples as ssc of 10 25 4 31 7 64 and 5 37 mg l were used for

field monitored effluent rwt concentration is shown in fig 4 b the elapsed time starts time 0 from the first rwt injection at 17 05 on 20 august 2014 due to equipment failure rwt data are missing for the elapsed day of 11 2 to 17 0 eluted rwt concentrations from the basin are on the order of 10 ppb ppb all the rwt concentrations are on a volumetric basis in comparison to the injected rwt concentration of 20 the eluted rwt concentration is approximately 2 10 7 times more dilute which indicates the large variability of the rwt concentration though the system in total four distinct rwt responses rising peak and recession limbs can be identified in the rwt profile which corresponds to four of five instantaneous rwt inlet injections as shown in fig 4b and table 2 the elapsed peak time of concentration of each rwt injection varies from 1 2 injection 5 to 4 9 days injection 3 depending in the storm event for the monitored rwt injections the first injection is the only instantaneous injection at all inlets the first injection generated the highest peak concentration due to the largest injection volume of 3800ml 950 ml four inlets in the first injection the rising limb is more compressed in comparison with the other injections a significant concentration spike occurred relatively shortly after the first injection approximately 1 2 days in which the concentration increased by 15 ppb within a period of 2 h meanwhile in the basin response to injections 2 3 4 and 5 the rising limbs are relatively smooth however there are similar post injection concentration spikes indicated by the rapid increases in the rwt concentration profiles at the elapsed times of 10 0 17 6 26 3 and 31 1 days the monitored rwt tracer results suggest a dual peak elution response pattern by the basin a post injection spike followed by a smoother main elution peak this dual peak elution pattern is better indicated by injection 1 3 and 4 to further elucidate the generation of such a dual peak elution response pattern and system hydrodynamics numerical simulations were performed the numerical simulation results of the rwt tracer experiments are shown in figs 4b and 4c there are differences between the numerical simulation and the observed rwt tracer patterns particularly for the last tracer injection with no attempt to reduce the discrepancies by ad hoc calibration a contributing source of the discrepancy is from a temporary velocimeter failure at the n inlet from the elapsed day 32 to 34 5 as a result the hydrograph of the n inlet was estimated with the observed flow data of the ne inlet in the model additionally the model predicts a higher rwt concentration for the post injection spike at the first injection there are several factors that contributed to this difference first the sampling frequency of 15 min for physical monitoring is significantly different than that of 10 s for the cfd model suggesting that potentially that the actual physical sampling frequency was not sufficient to capture the complete profile of a post injection spike and measured a lower concentration around the peak i e aliasing error second the rwt transport and mixing in this basin are substantially influenced by the flow bifurcations that are generated by the baffle systems and the turbulence induced dispersion ouro et al 2020 adams and rodi 1990 studies by ouro et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 demonstrate the tracer concentration level and elution profile can also depend on the exact inflow and turbulence status at the instantaneous moment of tracer release an exact profiling and accurate simulation of the turbulence flow and the subsequent 40 days rwt elution in such a basin with the high fidelity method such as large eddy simulation les is very difficult computationally and is a major challenge for the modeling of such a large scale system hinterberger et al 2007 as shown in table 2 there is a relative percent difference rpd of 12 2 and 19 1 between the physical results and cfd model with reference to the concentration peaking time and main elution peak rwt concentration considering the complexity and uncertainty of the basin system that is not fully characterized and a large variability of 2 10 7 in the rwt concentration the agreement between the rwt elution behavior and cfd model is reasonable for an uncontrolled field experiment rodriguez et al 2004 the physical tracer experiments and the cfd model agree with the dual peak elution pattern of the system this phenomenon becomes more evident by numerically deconvoluting the rwt elution into each individual injection component based on the linearity of the transport equation as shown in fig 4c despite variations in the injection locations volume timing and incoming storm events the elution behavior of all the injections are subject to an immediate post injection spike that followed by a smoothly increasing and decreasing peak in addition in the first injection the post injection spike is mainly contributed by the injection from the e inlet as shown in figs 4c and 5 the rwt concentration contour reveals that the post injection spike is generated by the flow short circuiting along the east bank of the basin between the end of the constructed baffles and the bank at higher water levels and the rwt injection from the e inlet is directly subject to this short circuiting flow pathway furthermore in the cfd simulation as shown in fig 4c the event averaged elution rt of rwt estimated as time taken for 90 elution of injected rwt mass is approximately 12 days in contrast based on existing regulatory guidance st johns river water management district 2018 the system rt is estimated to be 5 1 days with the basin volume of 37767 6 m3 and mean total flowrate of 85 5 l s during the monitoring period this discrepancy illustrates that approximating rt as the ratio of basin volume and mean hydraulic load does not yield representative estimation of basin elution or rt furthermore such approximation methods do not provide any inferences or insights on system short circuiting or hydraulically dead zones under the continuous hydraulic loading the hydrodynamics and mass transport in the system is complex as shown in fig 5 while the turbulent jets of the inlets create substantial mass mixing near the north end of the system the mass advection and dispersion in the downstream channels formed between baffles are dominated by flow separation and vortices at the leading and trailing edge of the baffles as shown in fig 6a the 25 50 and 75 percentile values of the reynolds number for the ne inlet are 9867 22364 and 42855 the 25 50 and 75 percentile of w inlet reynolds number are 3954 7497 and 12527 during the tracer monitoring period the frequency distribution of the reynolds number for the channels between baffles and through the permeable media of the baffles is shown in fig 6b the channel flow velocity was numerically sampled in the channel between baffle 8 and 9 counting from the north the permeable media of the baffles superficial velocity was numerically sampled at baffle 8 the numerical sampling interval is one minute the sampling location of baffle 8 is chosen to be sufficiently far from the influence of the inlet jets at the north end of the basin the 25 and 75 percentile of channel reynolds numbers are 1231 and 2730 the 25 and 75 percentile of permeable media reynolds numbers are 5 6 and 20 0 the median of the channel and permeable media reynolds number is 1866 and 11 4 which indicates for the majority of the time the channel flow between the baffles is at the lower end of the turbulent regime and the flow with the permeable gabion baffles is in the finite reynolds number laminar regime considering the relatively low turbulence condition future investigation of baffle design details within a reduced domain is therefore possible with high fidelity turbulence simulations such as les and direct numerical simulation dns meanwhile as the reynolds number within the permeable media deviates from the stokes regime the classic filtration model such as yao and rajagopalan tien model is potentially challenged tien 2012 li and sansalone 2020 further investigation on the finite reynolds number granular filtration of crc and the corresponding contribution to the system pm separation can follow the multi scale approach li and sansalone 2020 3 2 the influence of quasi steady simplification of the hydrograph the comparison of the fully transient and quasi steady cfd models for the tracer study is shown in fig 7 consistent with the observations and conclusions of previous studies garofalo and sansalone 2011 spelman and sansalone 2017 there can be a difference between the fully transient and quasi steady simulations as shown in table 3 the quasi steady model predicts the concentration peaking time 22 1 earlier than the fully transient simulation on average this discrepancy is potentially caused by the neglecting the detention mechanism in the quasi steady model in which the water elevation is fixed in time in such a model the quasi steady and fully transient simulations produce a reasonable agreement with respect to the general elution behavior of the basin a 4 8 mean rpd in peak concentration is observed between the fully transient and quasi steady model the quasi steady model is also able to identify short circuiting and predict the dual peak elution pattern as illustrated in fig 7 moreover the computational expense of the quasi steady model for the 40 day tracer simulation was 1 2 cpu hours making quasi steady approximately 10 times faster than the cpu time of 11 4 h of the fully transient model and 320 times faster than the cpu time of 16 days of rans model spelman and sansalone 2018 the computational expenses are estimated on hipergator 2 0 university of florida 2016 with intel xeon e5 2698 v3 processors high computational efficiency and reasonable accuracy imply that quasi steady models are ideal as a surrogate model for design exploration and comparison in the initial design phases fully transient simulations may be necessary for accurate estimation of the absolute behavior of basins or water treatment unit operations and process designs 3 3 influence of baffling and permeability on tracer elution and pm separation fully transient simulations of rwt tracer study were extended to the pre retrofit as designed and impervious baffle configurations tabulated model results for all configurations are shown in table 4 due to the similarity in elution behavior and the need for brevity the comparisons are focused on the period of the first three injections as shown in fig 8 among all configurations as built and pre retrofit configuration experience post injection spikes which indicate the existence of short circuiting in the system in addition the pre retrofit configuration generates significantly higher elution concentration and responds to the rwt injection more rapidly than other baffling conditions the third injection in particular exhibits concentration peaking time approximately 2 3 days earlier than other baffling conditions these results suggest that the baffling improves overall hydrodynamic mixing in the system and increases the tracer rt meanwhile among the baffled configurations post injection spikes only appear in the as built condition with short circuiting between the east bank and end of the baffles the as designed permeable baffle and impervious baffle configurations eliminate the occurrence of the post injection spike short circuiting especially in the first injection where the tracer was also injected to the east inlet this comparison between as built and as designed emphasizes the importance of the details in construction and suggests that the existing system performance can be further improved by fully extending and socketing the baffles to the east bank of the basin with respect to the influence of the baffle permeability the impervious baffle and as designed permeable baffle configurations demonstrate a similar elution behavior however the as designed permeable baffle delays the concentration peaking time by approximately 1 2 days in comparison to the impervious baffling condition as shown in table 4 in fig 9 the comparison of the depth integrated velocity contour reveals that higher velocities are developed in the channels formed by the impervious baffles relative to the permeable baffles increasing the rate of the mass transport through the system hydrodynamic differences notwithstanding the evaluation and comparison of design configurations including the pre retrofit basin with respect to pm separation is a function of pm granulometry including the psd and pm density spelman and sansalone 2018 as a clarification basin that generates type i sedimentation irrespective of original design or not given the coarser hetero disperse psd and density of the influent pm the pre retrofit basin was geometrically over sized based on surface area and volume with respect to the influent granulometry this result is critical for interpreting fig 10 and can be discerned based on the total mean influent flowrate of 85 5 l s and the mean basin surface area of 12600 m2 which yields a nominal surface overflow rate sor of 0 407 l min m2 6 786 10 6 m s the corresponding pm diameters that yield the same sor equivalent to a type i settling velocity are 48 10 and 3 μm for densities of 1000 1100 and 2650 kg m3 the relative gravimetric contributions of each of these pm diameters to the influent psd have cumulative mass fractions that can be discerned in fig s4 of the si the comparison of design retrofit alternatives with respect to the pre retrofit basin is presented in fig 10 the combination of the relatively coarse granulometry and pre retrofit geometrics produced results where all design configurations yield high gravimetric mass based pm separation 95 for siliceous pm 2 65 specific gravity pm separation significantly decreases as the volatile content of pm increases pm density decreases for example with increasing biogenic pm for the siliceous pm there are negligible differences between the designs considering the already high gravimetric mass based pm separation of 95 as a result of the geometrically oversized basin relative to the coarser psd influent and low hydraulic loads the retrofit design alternatives made smaller differences for higher density pm but the impacts increase with decreasing pm density regardless of the combination of the coarse pm granulometry and existing pre retrofit basin geometrics the cfd models consistently indicate that the pm separation performance is ranked in the following order as designed pervious baffles impervious baffles as built pervious baffles and pre retrofit with no baffles when considering hydrodynamics this pm separation performance ranking is also suggested by the previous tracer elution simulations by further comparing the pm separation for each particle diameter a significant improvement of the as designed condition in comparison to the pre retrofit condition is observed results show that basin designs that increase tracer rt also improve pm separation as shown in fig 10b for the particle density of 1000 kg m3 denser than fluid density of 995 7 kg m3 approximately 30 to 40 relative increase for the particle diameters in the fine sediment range up to approximately 160 μm can be achieved by improving the system hydrodynamics through baffling even in the geometrically oversized basin an additional performance gain can also be expected due to the potential filtration mechanism of the crc not accounted for in any of the modeling in this study furthermore from a design and regulatory management perspective st johns river water management district 2018 the simulation results of pm separation have a strong implication on the importance of influent pm granulometry and pm bound constituents pathogens nutrients metals or organics in the design and regulatory verification process for example if the system was intended to separate only coarser siliceous pm in the coarser sediment size pm gradation range then the degree of baffling in a retrofit may not need to be as extensive if the influent pm had a significant contribution of organic and biogenic matter algae and predominately finer suspended 25 μm pm based on mass basin clarification sedimentation within baffle channels will not be as effective as crc filtration by the permeable baffles and hence the design should emphasize baffle design configuration for filtration of suspended size pm and chemical loads such as phosphorus bound to pm li and sansalone 2020 the cfd models can be extended to adsorptive filtration such as aqueous chemical species based on the properties e g adsorption kinetics of the permeable baffle media in previous studies wu and sansalone 2013b liu et al 2005 li and sansalone 2020 björklund and li 2015 4 discussion the hydrodynamic response and therefore the transport fate of pm chemicals pathogens subject to unsteady and episodic loadings in a continuous time series is complex existing design practices analytical tools and regulatory guidance do not consider such complexity given that conventional design and monitoring tools cannot economically capture such complexity spelman and sansalone 2018 for example the estimation of basin rt as the ratio of basin volume and hydraulic load over the wet season is widely practiced yet while such guidance is an expeditious index the guidance does not yield a representative approximation of basin rt and does not provide guidance as to internal basin hydrodynamics or response especially with internal basin retrofits for the prototype basin retrofit with an internal permeable baffle system the basin rt is 12 days as determined by cfd simulations which compared reasonably well with physical monitoring of the rwt tracer this result is compared to 5 1 days based on conventional rt guidance for water treatment in a clarification basin such rt guidance can overestimate the required basin geometrics for a given level of performance and therefore increase the spatial requirement construction and potential maintenance costs as well as lost opportunity costs for the land the proposed cfd modeling framework is suitable for simulating long term basin system dynamics under complex hydraulic conditions the model provides higher fidelity than current methods of regulatory design guidance and analytical tools for example in a common lumped analysis of pm fate assuming a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr model krajewski et al 2017 huber et al 2006 chapra 1997 elliott and trowsdale 2007 the pm mass conservation equation is defined as the following equation noting that the inflow and outflow mass flux of pm are considered by the boundary conditions 11 dhc j dt d j e j comparison of the cstr model eq 11 and the pm transport equation of this study eq 4 reveals that the cstr model eq 11 is an approximation of the pm transport equation of the proposed cfd modeling framework eq 4 with the omission of two primary terms advective flux of h u c j and diffusive flux of h s c j while the approximation of a cstr model simplifies the governing equation of pm fate from a partial differential equation pde to an ordinary differential equation ode the elimination of these two fluxes and the assumption of well mixed condition concentration has no spatial dependence directly impacts the cstr model s validity and generality in particular the elimination of the advective flux of h u c j in the cstr model eq 11 leads to physically unrealistic independence decoupling of the pm transport eq 4 from the system hydrodynamics eq 2 as a result the cstr model is not formulated to predict the influence of the baffle modified system hydrodynamics on the fate of pm for physically based simulations the literature in heat transfer hahn and özisik 2012 and turbulent multiphase flow balachandar and eaton 2010 confirm the need for consideration of the momentum transport of fluid flow and subsequent coupling thereof with pm chemicals and pathogens the proposed model can be operated in a fully transient or quasi steady mode the computational efficiency of the proposed model is approximately 320 times faster than a rans model for quasi steady simulation of the clarification basin while the quasi steady simplified cfd model predicts the short circuiting in design the differences between the fully transient and quasi steady simplified simulation are observed therefore the quasi steady simplified model is recommended for initial basin design screening due to the computational efficiency of the model the fully transient simulation is recommended for the final evaluation of system behavior in addition the developed cfd model could be integrated with the existing hydrologic models such as swmm stormwater management model huber 1984 nix et al 1988 elliott and trowsdale 2007 to predict in situ basin performance prior to construction with openfoam as the development platform the extension of this model to hydrostatic and non hydrostatic 3d simulations is readily achievable furthermore the proposed model is effectively applied to examine design alternatives and establish a baseline for pre retrofit basin behavior permeable baffle media material is preferred over the impervious material in terms of hydrodynamics irrespective of engineered adsorptive filtration media benefits for a permeable system wu and sansalone 2013a wu and sansalone 2013b in spite of the unsteady and stochastic hydraulic loading from storm events locations within the basin that are outside of regions impacted from inlet jets function at the low end of the turbulent regime in addition the reynolds numbers within the permeable gabion baffles are within the finite reynolds number laminar regime this provides the potential for the future development of computationally inexpensive and robust models to simulate complex internal hydrodynamics within basins and within engineered permeable media systems for filtration and surface complexation adsorption phenomena for nutrients and toxicants liu et al 2005 5 conclusions impacts of permeable baffle retrofits on the response of an existing clarification basin in a continuous time domain of episodic hydraulic loadings is investigated by tracer monitoring and numerical simulation with cfd models based on the modification of the shallow water equation swe to elucidate i basin hydrodynamics ii 40 days of rhodamine wt rwt tracer elution behavior iii quasi steady hydraulic loadings as compared to fully transient simulations iv particulate matter pm separation and v alternative baffle designs for the basin retrofit results of the monitoring and modeling yield the following conclusions 1 modeling the internal hydrodynamics of the existing basin retrofit reveals two distinct hydrodynamic regimes as a direct result of the permeable baffles the intra baffle channel flow between baffles is at the lower end of the turbulent regime while inter baffle flow through the permeable baffles is in the finite reynolds number laminar range 2 rwt transport and mixing are significantly influenced by the flow bifurcation generated by the permeable baffle system and the turbulence induced dispersion at the inlets the tracer monitoring and numerical simulations produced a similar dual peak tracer elution pattern for the as built retrofit condition this dual peak tracer elution pattern is a result of short circuiting in the as built retrofit 3 the quasi steady numerical models produce good representation for the general elution behavior of the basin accepting that the models predict earlier rwt concentration peaking than the fully transient models however the quasi steady models are approximately ten times more efficient than the fully transient models 4 for the relatively coarser psd loadings alternate designs did not yield large differences for total pm separation across pm densities noting that the pre retrofit basin is significantly over sized geometrically area and volume for the coarse hetero disperse influent psd and lower hydraulic fluxes a simple sor evaluation irrespective of hydrodynamics also points to a similar conclusion however as compared to the pre retrofit cfd determined that baffling did provide a significant increase in separation for pm in the finer sediment diameters up to approximately 160 μm 5 the elution behavior of the basin as a system is controlled by hydrodynamics which is modified and managed by the retrofit design and baffle details baffling improves volumetric utilization delays the elution process increases rt and improves pm separation design alternatives demonstrate that construction details influence basin retrofit behavior as clearly shown by the short circuiting results of the as built configuration permeable baffles provide hydrodynamic benefits and delay the overall elution by reducing hydraulic stresses in the channels between baffles compared to impervious baffles the numerical models facilitated these evaluations comparison of baffle configuration alternatives and insights into internal basin behavior

4772,clarification basins have been implemented for millennia as a unit operation uo modern basins are intended to manage hydrologic hydraulic phenomena while sequestering particulate matter pm and pm

hydrodynamics subject to highly unsteady continuous time domain flows is a novel investigation in this study in situ monitoring and numerical simulations are conducted for a full scale prototype urban drainage basin while geometrically oversized with respect to the relatively coarse particle size distribution and hydraulic loading retrofitted with gabion baffles composed of crushed carbonated recycled concrete a 40 day tracer monitoring of hydrodynamics within the retrofit basin is tested against a novel application of a depth averaged unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations urans as a computational fluid dynamics cfd model in the openfoam framework a dual peak elution pattern is observed in response to tracer injections in the physical and simulated fully transient and quasi steady results short circuiting around the baffles in the as built retrofit is elucidated with monitoring and modeling simulations of retrofit configurations pre retrofit as designed as built

environs and human health renwick et al 2006 while clarification basins wet retention has been implemented and promulgated by regulatory stakeholders as part of urban suburban land development or through re development or infrastructure retrofit plans for over a half century renwick et al 2006 spelman and sansalone 2018 united states environmental protection agency 2002 the elucidation of the transport fate processes within basins as driven by basin hydrodynamics remains limited and challenging chemical and pathogen transport fate notwithstanding a primary challenge is the transport fate of pm loading subject to unsteady and continuous hydrology noting that a heterodisperse particle size distribution psd is a primary vector for chemical and pathogen transport fate transport fate in a basin is coupled to and driven by the hydrodynamics generated from stochastic and episodic runoff loadings during a continuous time series of runoff loadings the basin residence time distribution rtd response can encompass multiple runoff event loadings driven by runoff induced pressure gradients and hydraulic stresses the internal basin hydrodynamic response and the coupled elution of pm can exhibit large variations spatially and temporally a heterodisperse and variable psd further complicates a description of pm transport fate within a basin kim and sansalone 2008 sansalone et al 1998 spelman and sansalone 2018 previous studies have illustrated these unsteadiness challenges and identified the importance of spatial and temporal phenomena in the examination of basin load response garofalo and sansalone 2011 shih et al 2017 spelman and sansalone 2017 spelman and sansalone 2018 krajewski et al 2017 current regulatory design and management guidance does not explicitly address such a dynamic intra basin and elution response to momentum transport decades of guidance has been based on empirical and lumped indices such as a 14 or 21 day residence time rt st johns river water management district 2018 harper and baker 2007 livingston et al 1988 camp dresser and mckee inc 1985 florida department of environmental protection 2020 since such indices cannot represent the dynamic intra basin and elution response to continuous time domain loadings these lumped models suffer from poor generalization and require higher level calibrations on a case by case basis hahn and özisik 2012 elliott and trowsdale 2007 chow et al 2010 wilcox 2006 krajewski et al 2017 for system design management and retrofits such lumped models that may implicitly infer mass volume continuity provide little guidance for the intra basin design and in particular retrofitting existing basins where spatial constraints do not permit spatial surface area and volume augmentation specifically momentum transport as described by the navier stokes set of equations is not applied to elucidate basin hydrodynamics krajewski et al 2017 huber et al 2006 chow et al 2010 commonly assumptions of uniform flow or a well mixed condition must be introduced to mathematically close the mass transport conservation equation for the analytical model chosen models such as a surface overflow rate sor model and continuously stirred tank reactors cstr spelman and sansalone 2018 huber et al 2006 hazen 1904 are generally applied subject to a steady flow although a sor model has been extended and validated for event based unsteady pm transport and fate ying and sansalone 2010 by neglecting momentum transport in these models the system behavior irrespective of spatial basin scale is typically estimated as a function of flowrate treatment volume and surface area harper and baker 2007 st johns river water management district 2018 for example the existing regulatory guidance of st johns river water management district 2018 requires the permanent pool of a wet basin to be dimensioned for a rt estimated as volume flowrate of at least 14 days during the wet season to achieve a presumptive basin performance of 80 consequently existing design methods and regulatory guidance cannot quantitatively differentiate design alternations such as spatial basin geometrics inlet out configurations and internal retrofits beyond qualitative guidance stamou et al 1989 adams and rodi 1990 while the current design and analytical tools are expeditious the existing methods do not allow for mechanistic insights into the in situ system behavior and cannot identify potential system behavior liabilities furthermore if a basin is not designed and examined to identify potential hydrodynamic short circuiting and dead zones the cost of retrofitting treatment behavior operations and maintenance can be impacted spelman and sansalone 2018 zhang et al 2014 with the goal of improving system hydraulic efficiency while reducing spatial requirements thereby improving the economics of basin construction several methods have been considered in the literature garofalo and sansalone 2018 howard et al 2011 liu and garcía 2011 zhang et al 2013 among these baffling has been widely applied in uop systems such as heat exchangers chlorine contact chambers and sedimentation clarifiers garofalo and sansalone 2018 fang et al 2015 shih et al 2017 compared with retrofitting a basin based on spatial augmentation and or inlet outlet re configuration retrofitting an existing basin with baffles or designing a basin initially with baffles is more flexible and has been shown to be more economical shih et al 2017 florida department of transportation 2010 florida department of transportation 2016 previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of impervious baffles through computational fluid dynamics cfd and bench scale physical modeling fang et al 2015 garofalo and sansalone 2018 kattnig and venayagamoorthy 2015 lyn and rodi 1990 while the cfd shows substantially improved predictive capability for various designs in comparison to lumped models liu and zhang 2019 sinha et al 2012 the role of in situ pervious baffling in a full scale clarification basin system under continuous time domain unsteady hydraulic loading has not been examined in comparison to conventional water and wastewater uop systems such as a primary clarifier or a chlorine contact chamber urban drainage basins are subject to episodic storm induced inflow these basins can have significant range of spatial scales for example on a surface area basis from less than 100 m 2 florida department of transportation 2010 to larger than 7000 m 2 renwick et al 2006 the subject basin of this study has a surface area of approximately 12 600 m 2 at normal water elevation depending on the interaction between basin geometrics watershed influent loadings and controls downgradient of the basin the basin hydrodynamics and transport phenomena are influenced by the continuous time domain hydraulic loads generated by multiple runoff events in which the time scale of elution process can range from hours to greater than a week fang et al 2015 shih et al 2017 spelman and sansalone 2017 single event based analysis potentially yields unrepresentative results and hence continuous physical monitoring or simulation is preferred over the entire continuous time domain elution process fang et al 2015 spelman and sansalone 2017 ahilan et al 2019 guan et al 2018 in addition as pointed out by spelman and sansalone 2018 who applied a stepwise steady cfd approach due to the large spatial and temporal scales cfd simulations of a basin system with the common approach of three dimensional 3d steady unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans urans model can result in higher computational expenses approximately 16 cpu days for rans thus there exists a practical need for a numerical model to allow for a design that considers hydrodynamic complexities at a reasonable computation outlay for example a workstation with 32 cores to overcome these computational constraints while preserving the generality of the model in this study the depth averaged unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equation also known as shallow water equation swe is adopted as the foundation of the cfd model development due to the computational efficiency the c framework of open source field operation and manipulation openfoam is utilized to parallelize model computations weller et al 1998 this study s overall objective is to develop and examine an swe based cfd model as a higher fidelity complementary tool for stormwater clarification basin design and retrofit compared to the existing presumptive criteria the central hypothesis of this study is that an swe based cfd model can overcome the limitation of presumptive criteria simulate turbulent transport fate process in basin systems and provide more accurate predictions of system performance under episodic hydraulic and constituent in this study as pm loadings while benefit from computational efficiency compared to 3d urans to attain the overall objective the following four specific objectives are pursued in this study the first objective elucidates the hydrodynamic and elution behavior of a permeable baffled basin subject to continuous time domain unsteady flows from august to september of 2014 through physical tracer monitoring and numerical simulations with the proposed cfd model based on the swe the second objective compares modeled results with measured data from the tracer study to evaluate the efficacy of both fully transient and quasi steady models a third objective examines the turbulence conditions within the basin to further elucidate the system hydrodynamics in terms of turbulent flow regimes the final objective compares responses of a series of design conditions with in situ baffling and permeable gabion baffles basin hydrodynamics and pm separation of these designs are compared through numerical simulation results for i pre retrofit ii as designed iii as built and iv impervious baffle conditions of the same basin bathymetry 2 material and methods the physically based data applied in this research were obtained from a monitoring campaign of a basin system at an airport in southwest florida apf in 2014 and 2015 the basin plan view configuration and bathymetry are shown in fig 1 the basin is 260 m in length north to south with a lateral dimension that varies from 40 to 86 m as shown in figs 1 and 2 twelve fully submerged permeable gabion baffles comprised of crushed carbonated reclaimed concrete crc were constructed along the lateral direction to train the flow pattern and increase flow tortuosity at the basin and baffle scale this basin system is an urban drainage basin which is loaded by airport and commercial land use runoff through a dendritic municipal storm sewer system ms4 that potentially receives intermittent dry weather discharges during a storm event there is inflow through four inflow conveyances two are located at the north n and northeast ne end of the basin and two are located along the east e and west w bank toward the basin s n end the outlet is a triple box culvert at the south s end of the basin and is directly hydraulically connected to another downstream basin where the effluent is eventually discharged into a tidally influenced channel through a combined orifice and weir outflow structure the monitored basin is subject to downstream tidal influences through the outflow structure the flowrate and water elevation at inlets and outlets were measured in real time by velocimeters and pressure transducers campbell scientific

basin between august and september 2014 to index the hydrodynamics of the in situ permeable baffle system subject to a continuous time domain of uncontrolled inflows a fluorescent dye rhodamine wt rwt solution vasudevan et al 2001 was injected at several inlets at different injection times during the study as shown in table 1 a calibrated fluorimeter hydrolab ms5 ott hydromet 2019 with a detection limit of 1 ppb and a 3 accuracy range specified for concentrations of 1 100 parts per billion ppb was installed at the approximate depth centroid of the center south outflow conveyance face and two meters in front of the face of this box culvert conveyance the injected quantity of the concentrated rwt solution 20 was established based on the estimated incoming flows dilution of the rwt within the basin and the detection range of the fluorimeter time interval measurements of 15 min were used for sampling the eluted rwt concentration from the basin by the fluorimeter the measurements were continued until the rwt concentration fell below the detection limit in the fully transient numerical simulation of the tracer eqs 1 3 are coupled and solved the measured hydrographs and water elevation were applied at the north end inflow and the south end outflow as shown in fig 3 the classic wet dry boundary condition for flooding simulations is not considered in this study because the water surface area changes due to water elevation changes in a stormwater clarification basin are typically minimal especially in the subject clarification basin in this study in which the vertical walls completely define the west boundary as indicated by the bathymetry contour in fig 1c the model was initialized from 17 august 2014 approximately 3 days before the first rwt injection to establish the initial hydrodynamic conditions bathymetry and wind stress are also considered in the model and characteristics of these basin conditions are shown in fig 1 through fig 3 for flows through the permeable baffles the permeable media is modeled as a darcy forchheimer momentum sink a darcy and forchheimer coefficient of 263715 8 m 2 and 893 1 m 1 are estimated by the ergun equation ergun and orning 1949 with a mean equivalent media diameter of 10 2 cm and porosity of 0 3 of the crc of the permeable baffles while the crc is an adsorptive media liu et al 2010 liu et al 2005 for

operator in the non orthogonality grid jasak 1996 a computational grid size of 23000 is determined through the numerical convergence study as shown in fig s3 in the si while the fully transient model is evaluated with the field tracer study results a quasi steady simplification of the hydrographs are also examined in this study in the quasi steady simplified model instead of applying the observed unsteady hydrographs to the inlets the mean flowrate of the hydrographs over the period of the tracer study is used the flow momentum equations are then solved in a steady state mode once the flow field is converged momentum residuals 10 6 the flow momentum calculations are terminated and the tracer transport equation is solved as is the case for the fully transient model in addition to the permeable baffles the actual as built retrofit and as designed conditions as illustrated in fig 1 and 2 additional system configurations include a pre retrofit no baffle and impervious baffle configurations are also explored the pre retrofit condition represents the condition of the basin without baffles the as designed condition represents the original design configuration where the permeable baffles are fully extended into the banks of the subject basin the as built condition differs from the as design condition by that there exist gaps between the end of baffles and the east bank at high water levels the impervious baffle condition is identical to the as designed condition except the baffles are impervious and are not permeable baffles 2 3 particulate matter pm separation in the physical monitoring campaign of the basin 10 storm events were monitored from 12 september 2014 event 1 to 24 july 2015 event 10 with event based rainfall depths that ranged from 19 0 to 80 8 mm in total 599 inflow and 365 outflow samples were collected and analyzed for pm indices the pm indices were measured as suspended sediment concentration ssc total suspended solids tss and gravimetric particle size distribution psd the pm separation by the basin as integrated through the overall monitoring campaign is used as an index of the as built basin system response detailed laboratory analysis and field procedures are provided elsewhere florida department of transportation 2016 simulations of pm separation were carried out for the mean flow condition of the 10 monitored storm events the event mean flowrates of 9 90 4 46 49 8 and 37 5 l s were applied to e w ne and n inlets median values of the influent pm samples as ssc of 10 25 4 31 7 64 and 5 37 mg l were used for the e w ne and n inlet as shown in fig s4 in the si the mass weighted psd of 559 influent pm samples are considered and discretized into 16 particle diameters in the model 1 2 3 6 10 15 20 30 50 80 100 130 160 210 350 and 500 μm pm separation is simulated for pm densities of 1000 organic pm 1100 and 2650 inorganic siliceous pm kg m3 for pre retrofit as designed as built and impervious baffle

field monitored effluent rwt concentration is shown in fig 4 b the elapsed time starts time 0 from the first rwt injection at 17 05 on 20 august 2014 due to equipment failure rwt data are missing for the elapsed day of 11 2 to 17 0 eluted rwt concentrations from the basin are on the order of 10 ppb ppb all the rwt concentrations are on a volumetric basis in comparison to the injected rwt concentration of 20 the eluted rwt concentration is approximately 2 10 7 times more dilute which indicates the large variability of the rwt concentration though the system in total four distinct rwt responses rising peak and recession limbs can be identified in the rwt profile which corresponds to four of five instantaneous rwt inlet injections as shown in fig 4b and table 2 the elapsed peak time of concentration of each rwt injection varies from 1 2 injection 5 to 4 9 days injection 3 depending in the storm event for the monitored rwt injections the first injection is the only instantaneous injection at all inlets the first injection generated the highest peak concentration due to the largest injection volume of 3800ml 950 ml four inlets in the first injection the rising limb is more compressed in comparison with the other injections a significant concentration spike occurred relatively shortly after the first injection approximately 1 2 days in which the concentration increased by 15 ppb within a period of 2 h meanwhile in the basin response to injections 2 3 4 and 5 the rising limbs are relatively smooth however there are similar post injection concentration spikes indicated by the rapid increases in the rwt concentration profiles at the elapsed times of 10 0 17 6 26 3 and 31 1 days the monitored rwt tracer results suggest a dual peak elution response pattern by the basin a post injection spike followed by a smoother main elution peak this dual peak elution pattern is better indicated by injection 1 3 and 4 to further elucidate the generation of such a dual peak elution response pattern and system hydrodynamics numerical simulations were performed the numerical simulation results of the rwt tracer experiments are shown in figs 4b and 4c there are differences between the numerical simulation and the observed rwt tracer patterns particularly for the last tracer injection with no attempt to reduce the discrepancies by ad hoc calibration a contributing source of the discrepancy is from a temporary velocimeter failure at the n inlet from the elapsed day 32 to 34 5 as a result the hydrograph of the n inlet was estimated with the observed flow data of the ne inlet in the model additionally the model predicts a higher rwt concentration for the post injection spike at the first injection there are several factors that contributed to this difference first the sampling frequency of 15 min for physical monitoring is significantly different than that of 10 s for the cfd model suggesting that potentially that the actual physical sampling frequency was not sufficient to capture the complete profile of a post injection spike and measured a lower concentration around the peak i e aliasing error second the rwt transport and mixing in this basin are substantially influenced by the flow bifurcations that are generated by the baffle systems and the turbulence induced dispersion ouro et al 2020 adams and rodi 1990 studies by ouro et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 demonstrate the tracer concentration level and elution profile can also depend on the exact inflow and turbulence status at the instantaneous moment of tracer release an exact profiling and accurate simulation of the turbulence flow and the subsequent 40 days rwt elution in such a basin with the high fidelity method such as large eddy simulation les is very difficult computationally and is a major challenge for the modeling of such a large scale system hinterberger et al 2007 as shown in table 2 there is a relative percent difference rpd of 12 2 and 19 1 between the physical results and cfd model with reference to the concentration peaking time and main elution peak rwt concentration considering the complexity and uncertainty of the basin system that is not fully characterized and a large variability of 2 10 7 in the rwt concentration the agreement between the rwt elution behavior and cfd model is reasonable for an uncontrolled field experiment rodriguez et al 2004 the physical tracer experiments and the cfd model agree with the dual peak elution pattern of the system this phenomenon becomes more evident by numerically deconvoluting the rwt elution into each individual injection component based on the linearity of the transport equation as shown in fig 4c despite variations in the injection locations volume timing and incoming storm events the elution behavior of all the injections are subject to an immediate post injection spike that followed by a smoothly increasing and decreasing peak in addition in the first injection the post injection spike is mainly contributed by the injection from the e inlet as shown in figs 4c and 5 the rwt concentration contour reveals that the post injection spike is generated by the flow short circuiting along the east bank of the basin between the end of the constructed baffles and the bank at higher water levels and the rwt injection from the e inlet is directly subject to this short circuiting flow pathway furthermore in the cfd simulation as shown in fig 4c the event averaged elution rt of rwt estimated as time taken for 90 elution of injected rwt mass is approximately 12 days in contrast based on existing regulatory guidance st johns river water management district 2018 the system rt is estimated to be 5 1 days with the basin volume of 37767 6 m3 and mean total flowrate of 85 5 l s during the monitoring period this discrepancy illustrates that approximating rt as the ratio of basin volume and mean hydraulic load does not yield representative estimation of basin elution or rt furthermore such approximation methods do not provide any inferences or insights on system short circuiting or hydraulically dead zones under the continuous hydraulic loading the hydrodynamics and mass transport in the system is complex as shown in fig 5 while the turbulent jets of the inlets create substantial mass mixing near the north end of the system the mass advection and dispersion in the downstream channels formed between baffles are dominated by flow separation and vortices at the leading and trailing edge of the baffles as shown in fig 6a the 25 50 and 75 percentile values of the reynolds number for the ne inlet are 9867 22364 and 42855 the 25 50 and 75 percentile of w inlet reynolds number are 3954 7497 and 12527 during the tracer monitoring period the frequency distribution of the reynolds number for the channels between baffles and through the permeable media of the baffles is shown in fig 6b the channel flow velocity was numerically sampled in the channel between baffle 8 and 9 counting from the north the permeable media of the baffles superficial velocity was numerically sampled at baffle 8 the numerical sampling interval is one minute the sampling location of baffle 8 is chosen to be sufficiently far from the influence of the inlet jets at the north end of the basin the 25 and 75 percentile of channel reynolds numbers are 1231 and 2730 the 25 and 75 percentile of permeable media reynolds numbers are 5 6 and 20 0 the median of the channel and permeable media reynolds number is 1866 and 11 4 which indicates for the majority of the time the channel flow between the baffles is at the lower end of the turbulent regime and the flow with the permeable gabion baffles is in the finite reynolds number laminar regime considering the relatively low turbulence condition future investigation of baffle design details within a reduced domain is therefore possible with high fidelity turbulence simulations such as les and direct numerical simulation dns meanwhile as the reynolds number within the permeable media deviates from the stokes regime the classic filtration model such as yao and rajagopalan tien model is potentially challenged tien 2012 li and sansalone 2020 further investigation on the finite reynolds number granular filtration of crc and the corresponding contribution to the system pm separation can follow the multi scale approach li and sansalone 2020 3 2 the influence of quasi steady simplification of the hydrograph the comparison of the fully transient and quasi steady cfd models for the tracer study is shown in fig 7 consistent with the observations and conclusions of previous studies garofalo and sansalone 2011 spelman and sansalone 2017 there can be a difference between the fully transient and quasi steady simulations as shown in table 3 the quasi steady model predicts the concentration peaking time 22 1 earlier than the fully transient simulation on average this discrepancy is potentially caused by the neglecting the detention mechanism in the quasi steady model in which the water elevation is fixed in time in such a model the quasi steady and fully transient simulations produce a reasonable agreement with respect to the general elution behavior of the basin a 4 8 mean rpd in peak concentration is observed between the fully transient and quasi steady model the quasi steady model is also able to identify short circuiting and predict the dual peak elution pattern as illustrated in fig 7 moreover the computational expense of the quasi steady model for the 40 day tracer simulation was 1 2 cpu hours making quasi steady approximately 10 times faster than the cpu time of 11 4 h of the fully transient model and 320 times faster than the cpu time of 16 days of rans model spelman and sansalone 2018 the computational expenses are estimated on hipergator 2 0 university of florida 2016 with intel xeon e5 2698 v3 processors high computational efficiency and reasonable accuracy imply that quasi steady models are ideal as a surrogate model for design exploration and comparison in the initial design phases fully transient simulations may be necessary for accurate estimation of the absolute behavior of basins or water treatment unit operations and process designs 3 3 influence of baffling and permeability on tracer elution and pm separation fully transient simulations of rwt tracer study were extended to the pre retrofit as designed and impervious baffle configurations tabulated model results for all configurations are shown in table 4 due to the similarity in elution behavior and the need for brevity the comparisons are focused on the period of the first three injections as shown in fig 8 among all configurations as built and pre retrofit configuration experience post injection spikes which indicate the existence of short circuiting in the system in addition the pre retrofit configuration generates significantly higher elution concentration and responds to the rwt injection more rapidly than other baffling conditions the third injection in particular exhibits concentration peaking time approximately 2 3 days earlier than other baffling conditions these results suggest that the baffling improves overall hydrodynamic mixing in the system and increases the tracer rt meanwhile among the baffled configurations post injection spikes only appear in the as built condition with short circuiting between the east bank and end of the baffles the as designed permeable baffle and impervious baffle configurations eliminate the occurrence of the post injection spike short circuiting especially in the first injection where the tracer was also injected to the east inlet this comparison between as built and as designed emphasizes the importance of the details in construction and suggests that the existing system performance can be further improved by fully extending and socketing the baffles to the east bank of the basin with respect to the influence of the baffle permeability the impervious baffle and as designed permeable baffle configurations demonstrate a similar elution behavior however the as designed permeable baffle delays the concentration peaking time by approximately 1 2 days in comparison to the impervious baffling condition as shown in table 4 in fig 9 the comparison of the depth integrated velocity contour reveals that higher velocities are developed in the channels formed by the impervious baffles relative to the permeable baffles increasing the rate of the mass transport through the system hydrodynamic differences notwithstanding the evaluation and comparison of design configurations including the pre retrofit basin with respect to pm separation is a function of pm granulometry including the psd and pm density spelman and sansalone 2018 as a clarification basin that generates type i sedimentation irrespective of original design or not given the coarser hetero disperse psd and density of the influent pm the pre retrofit basin was geometrically over sized based on surface area and volume with respect to the influent granulometry this result is critical for interpreting fig 10 and can be discerned based on the total mean influent flowrate of 85 5 l s and the mean basin surface area of 12600 m2 which yields a nominal surface overflow rate sor of 0 407 l min m2 6 786 10 6 m s the corresponding pm diameters that yield the same sor equivalent to a type i settling velocity are 48 10 and 3 μm for densities of 1000 1100 and 2650 kg m3 the relative gravimetric contributions of each of these pm diameters to the influent psd have cumulative mass fractions that can be discerned in fig s4 of the si the comparison of design retrofit alternatives with respect to the pre retrofit basin is presented in fig 10 the combination of the relatively coarse granulometry and pre retrofit geometrics produced results where all design configurations yield high gravimetric mass based pm separation 95 for siliceous pm 2 65 specific gravity pm separation significantly decreases as the volatile content of pm increases pm density decreases for example with increasing biogenic pm for the siliceous pm there are negligible differences between the designs considering the already high gravimetric mass based pm separation of 95 as a result of the geometrically oversized basin relative to the coarser psd influent and low hydraulic loads the retrofit design alternatives made smaller differences for higher density pm but the impacts increase with decreasing pm density regardless of the combination of the coarse pm granulometry and existing pre retrofit basin geometrics the cfd models consistently indicate that the pm separation performance is ranked in the following order as designed pervious baffles impervious baffles as built pervious baffles and pre retrofit with no baffles when considering hydrodynamics this pm separation performance ranking is also suggested by the previous tracer elution simulations by further comparing the pm separation for each particle diameter a significant improvement of the as designed condition in comparison to the pre retrofit condition is observed results show that basin designs that increase tracer rt also improve pm separation as shown in fig 10b for the particle density of 1000 kg m3 denser than fluid density of 995 7 kg m3 approximately 30 to 40 relative increase for the particle diameters in the fine sediment range up to approximately 160 μm can be achieved by improving the system hydrodynamics through baffling even in the geometrically oversized basin an additional performance gain can also be expected due to the potential filtration mechanism of the crc not accounted for in any of the modeling in this study furthermore from a design and regulatory management perspective st johns river water management district 2018 the simulation results of pm separation have a strong implication on the importance of influent pm granulometry and pm bound constituents pathogens nutrients metals or organics in the design and regulatory verification process for example if the system was intended to separate only coarser siliceous pm in the coarser sediment size pm gradation range then the degree of baffling in a retrofit may not need to be as extensive if the influent pm had a significant contribution of organic and biogenic matter algae and predominately finer suspended 25 μm pm based on mass basin clarification sedimentation within baffle channels will not be as effective as crc filtration by the permeable baffles and hence the design should emphasize baffle design configuration for filtration of suspended size pm and chemical loads such as phosphorus bound to pm li and sansalone 2020 the cfd models can be extended to adsorptive filtration such as aqueous chemical species based on the properties e g adsorption kinetics of the permeable baffle media in previous studies wu and sansalone 2013b liu et al 2005 li and sansalone 2020 björklund and li 2015 4 discussion the hydrodynamic response and therefore the transport fate of pm chemicals pathogens subject to unsteady and episodic loadings in a continuous time series is complex existing design practices analytical tools and regulatory guidance do not consider such complexity given that conventional design and monitoring tools cannot economically capture such complexity spelman and sansalone 2018 for example the estimation of basin rt as the ratio of basin volume and hydraulic load over the wet season is widely practiced yet while such guidance is an expeditious index the guidance does not yield a representative approximation of basin rt and does not provide guidance as to internal basin hydrodynamics or response especially with internal basin retrofits for the prototype basin retrofit with an internal permeable baffle system the basin rt is 12 days as determined by cfd simulations which compared reasonably well with physical monitoring of the rwt tracer this result is compared to 5 1 days based on conventional rt guidance for water treatment in a clarification basin such rt guidance can overestimate the required basin geometrics for a given level of performance and therefore increase the spatial requirement construction and potential maintenance costs as well as lost opportunity costs for the land the proposed cfd modeling framework is suitable for simulating long term basin system dynamics under complex hydraulic conditions the model provides higher fidelity than current methods of regulatory design guidance and analytical tools for example in a common lumped analysis of pm fate assuming a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr model krajewski et al 2017 huber et al 2006 chapra 1997 elliott and trowsdale 2007 the pm mass conservation equation is defined as the following equation noting that the inflow and outflow mass flux of pm are considered by the boundary conditions 11 dhc j dt d j e j comparison of the cstr model eq 11 and the pm transport equation of this study eq 4 reveals that the cstr model eq 11 is an approximation of the pm transport equation of the proposed cfd modeling framework eq 4 with the omission of two primary terms advective flux of h u c j and diffusive flux of h s c j while the approximation of a cstr model simplifies the governing equation of pm fate from a partial differential equation pde to an ordinary differential equation ode the elimination of these two fluxes and the assumption of well mixed condition concentration has no spatial dependence directly impacts the cstr model s validity and generality in particular the elimination of the advective flux of h u c j in the cstr model eq 11 leads to physically unrealistic independence decoupling of the pm transport eq 4 from the system hydrodynamics eq 2 as a result the cstr model is not formulated to predict the influence of the baffle modified system hydrodynamics on the fate of pm for physically based simulations the literature in heat transfer hahn and özisik 2012 and turbulent multiphase flow balachandar and eaton 2010 confirm the need for consideration of the momentum transport of fluid flow and subsequent coupling thereof with pm chemicals and pathogens the proposed model can be operated in a fully transient or quasi steady mode the computational efficiency of the proposed model is approximately 320 times faster than a rans model for quasi steady simulation of the clarification basin while the quasi steady simplified cfd model predicts the short circuiting in design the differences between the fully transient and quasi steady simplified simulation are observed therefore the quasi steady simplified model is recommended for initial basin design screening due to the computational efficiency of the model the fully transient simulation is recommended for the final evaluation of system behavior in addition the developed cfd model could be integrated with the existing hydrologic models such as swmm stormwater management model huber 1984 nix et al 1988 elliott and trowsdale 2007 to predict in situ basin performance prior to construction with openfoam as the development platform the extension of this model to hydrostatic and non hydrostatic 3d simulations is readily achievable furthermore the proposed model is effectively applied to examine design alternatives and establish a baseline for pre retrofit basin behavior permeable baffle media material is preferred over the impervious material in terms of hydrodynamics irrespective of engineered adsorptive filtration media benefits for a permeable system wu and sansalone 2013a wu and sansalone 2013b in spite of the unsteady and stochastic hydraulic loading from storm events locations within the basin that are outside of regions impacted from inlet jets function at the low end of the turbulent regime in addition the reynolds numbers within the permeable gabion baffles are within the finite reynolds number laminar regime this provides the potential for the future development of computationally inexpensive and robust models to simulate complex internal hydrodynamics within basins and within engineered permeable media systems for filtration and surface complexation adsorption phenomena for nutrients and toxicants liu et al 2005 5 conclusions impacts of permeable baffle retrofits on the response of an existing clarification basin in a continuous time domain of episodic hydraulic loadings is investigated by tracer monitoring and numerical simulation with cfd models based on the modification of the shallow water equation swe to elucidate i basin hydrodynamics ii 40 days of rhodamine wt rwt tracer elution behavior iii quasi steady hydraulic loadings as compared to fully transient simulations iv particulate matter pm separation and v alternative baffle designs for the basin retrofit results of the monitoring and modeling yield the following conclusions 1 modeling the internal hydrodynamics of the existing basin retrofit reveals two distinct hydrodynamic regimes as a direct result of the permeable baffles the intra baffle channel flow between baffles is at the lower end of the turbulent regime while inter baffle flow through the permeable baffles is in the finite reynolds number laminar range 2 rwt transport and mixing are significantly influenced by the flow bifurcation generated by the permeable baffle system and the turbulence induced dispersion at the inlets the tracer monitoring and numerical simulations produced a similar dual peak tracer elution pattern for the as built retrofit condition this dual peak tracer elution pattern is a result of short circuiting in the as built retrofit 3 the quasi steady numerical models produce good representation for the general elution behavior of the basin accepting that the models predict earlier rwt concentration peaking than the fully transient models however the quasi steady models are approximately ten times more efficient than the fully transient models 4 for the relatively coarser psd loadings alternate designs did not yield large differences for total pm separation across pm densities noting that the pre retrofit basin is significantly over sized geometrically area and volume for the coarse hetero disperse influent psd and lower hydraulic fluxes a simple sor evaluation irrespective of hydrodynamics also points to a similar conclusion however as compared to the pre retrofit cfd determined that baffling did provide a significant increase in separation for pm in the finer sediment diameters up to approximately 160 μm 5 the elution behavior of the basin as a system is controlled by hydrodynamics which is modified and managed by the retrofit design and baffle details baffling improves volumetric utilization delays the elution process increases rt and improves pm separation design alternatives demonstrate that construction details influence basin retrofit behavior as clearly shown by the short circuiting results of the as built configuration permeable baffles provide hydrodynamic benefits and delay the overall elution by reducing hydraulic stresses in the channels between baffles compared to impervious baffles the numerical models facilitated these evaluations comparison of baffle configuration alternatives and insights into internal basin behavior

4773,geostatistical and geospatial analysis techniques were employed to evaluate relationships between high arsenic as iron fe and manganese mn concentrations in groundwaters from the pleistocene mississippi river alluvial aquifer mraa in south central louisiana the mraa is recharged by the mississippi river and its groundwater contains fe concentrations that range from 0 43 to 179 µmol kg 1 n 40 and as concentrations that range from 26 nmol kg 1 up to 8500 nmol kg 1 i e 637 µg kg 1 arsenic speciation analysis reveals a mix of redox states with as v accounting for between ca 18 and ca 84 of the total dissolved as mean 1σ 61 6 24 4 n 6 spatial distributions of as fe and mn concentrations suggest that the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides oxyhydroxides is the likely source of as to the mraa groundwaters geostatistical and geospatial analyses were employed to produce interpolation maps that show concentrations of as fe and mn decrease with distance from the mississippi river spatial correlations are stronger between groundwater as and fe concentrations r 0 710 pas fe 0 0005 than those between the as and mn concentrations r 0 404 pas mn 0 0005 more specifically regions of the mraa characterized by high dissolved as concentrations spatially correlate with regions of high dissolved fe concentrations and to a lesser degree high dissolved mn concentrations we hypothesize that recharge of the mraa by mississippi river water introduces labile organic carbon into the mraa that subsequently fuels microbial respiration which reduces fe mn oxides oxyhydroxides and mobilizes adsorbed and or co precipitated as into mraa groundwaters once mobilized as is transported away from the riverbank by flowing groundwaters but is rapidly removed from solution by re adsorption onto fe mn oxides oxyhydroxides within the regionally oxidized aquifer sediments our investigation indicates that oxidized pleistocene sand aquifers in large river delta plains can also produce groundwater

al 2010 arsenic is an especially toxic and carcinogenic metalloid that is elevated in groundwater from the densely populated major river deltas of south and southeast asia ahmed et al 2004 bhattacharya et al 2002 rahman et al 2017 shankar et al 2014 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 winkel et al 2008 as well as the mississippi river delta plain in southern louisiana e g johannesson et al 2019 yang et al 2014 2016 human populations that are exposed to the regular intake of as contaminated water can have severe chronic health complications depending on the concentration levels and long exposure durations ayotte et al 2006 even et al 2017 mondal et al 2008 ratnaike 2003 stahl et al 2016 the majority of as affected groundwaters from the delta plains of south and southeast asia and southern louisiana are from shallow and reduced holocene aquifers whereas the underlying oxidized pleistocene aquifer sands at these locations produce groundwater with low as concentrations that are generally safe to drink ahmed et al 2004 biswas et al 2012 hossain et al 2014 johannesson et al 2019 mcarthur et al 2004 stahl et al 2016 van geen et al 2013 von brömssen et al 2007 von brömssen et al 2008 winkel et al 2008 yang et al 2014 2016 these and other as contaminated aquifers within the united states and around the world are commonly linked to iron fe and dissolved organic matter dom cycling that facilitates as mobilization from the aquifer sediments to the porewater via reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides coupled to organic carbon oxidation followed by the release of sorbed co precipitated as bauer and blodau 2006 dowling et al 2002 focazio et al 2000 haque et al 2008 herath et al 2016 horneman et al 2004 islam et al 2004 johannesson et al 2019 korte

et al 2014 2016 many holocene aquifers in river delta systems that produce high as groundwaters consist of organic rich fluvial alluvial deltaic sediments with a minimal amount of fe coatings for microbial reduction that were deposited as sea level rose following the last glacial maximum lcm and inundated interfluvial valleys formed during the pleistocene when sea level was substantially lower blum and roberts 2012 chakraborty et al 2007 johannesson et al 2019 korte 1991 mcarthur et al 2004 2008 wallis et al 2020 yang et al 2014 2016 in contrast pleistocene aquifers at these sites that produce low as groundwaters are characterized by relatively organic free river sediments containing abundant fe iii oxide coatings that were deposited during the low sea level stand that characterized the lcm blum and roberts 2012 datta et al 2011 kesel 2008 kulkarni et al 2017 mcarthur et al 2001 2008 neal et al 2010 sankar et al 2014 vega et al 2017 these pleistocene sediments were exposed to subaerial weathering conditions conducive to the precipitation of fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides e g mcarthur et al 2008 arsenic adsorbs strongly onto fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides surfaces and can occur within the lattice structure as co precipitates whereas labile organic matter fuels the microbial reduction of fe iii leading to as mobilization from sediments into groundwater dixit and hering 2003 2006 gorny et al 2015 gustafsson and bhattacharya 2007 johannesson et al 2019 kulkarni et al 2017 manning and goldberg 1996 mladenov et al 2010 pierce and moore 1982 vega et al 2017 wallis et al 2020 yang et al 2016 accordingly one remedy that has been proposed to help address the as problems in holocene fluvial alluvial aquifers is to drill deeper wells that abstract water from the underlying organic poor pleistocene aquifers rather than the organic rich holocene aquifers that produce as contaminated groundwaters ahmed et al 2006 burgess et al 2010 neumann et al 2010 ravenscroft et al 2005 yang et al 2014 southern louisiana shares strikingly similar geology and hydrogeology e g aquifer groundwater chemistry sediment characteristics deltaic and floodplain sedimentary depositional environments and organic matter content with the large river delta systems of south and southeast asia including high as groundwaters borrok et al 2018 johannesson et al 2019 yang et al 2014 2016 moreover our previous research on shallow holocene sediments from napoleonville louisiana and the upper chicot aquifer in cow island louisiana indicate that microbial reduction of fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides is the likely mechanism responsible for as mobilization into shallow groundwaters at these sites johannesson et al 2019 yang et al 2014 similar conclusions were reported by borrok et al 2018 for the pleistocene mississippi river alluvial aquifer mraa in louisiana and by sharif et al 2008 for the mraa in southern arkansas furthermore yang et al 2014 predicted that much of southern louisiana might be underlain by shallow groundwater with elevated as concentrations higher than 133 nmol kg 1 i e 10 µg kg 1 which is the maximum safe drinking water standard for human consumption recommended by the united states environmental protection agency us epa and world health organization who usepa 2001 thus it is reasonable to expect that the same or similar biogeochemical processes that lead to as mobilization into shallow groundwater at napoleonville and cow island louisiana as well as the mraa also act to mobilize as into groundwaters across much of southern louisiana borrok et al 2018 johannesson et al 2019 yang et al 2014 2016 in this contribution we present as fe and manganese mn concentration data provided by the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq as well as arsenic speciation analyses used in conjunction with the larger ldeq dataset for groundwater from the pleistocene mraa adjacent to the mississippi river near baton rouge louisiana the overall objective of this study is to demonstrate that pleistocene aquifer sands of the mraa that are rich in fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides i e kesel 2008 can also produce high as groundwaters when these sands are exposed to labile forms of organic matter or other reducing agents that can mediate reductive dissolution of the as bearing fe mn oxides oxyhydroxides we show using geostatistical and geospatial tools in conjunction with the current understanding of the regional groundwater flow regime e g borrok et al 2018 kolker et al 2013 welch and hanor 2011 whiteman 1972 that the spatial distribution of as fe and mn in groundwaters of the mraa proximal to the mississippi river are consistent with our conceptual model whereby labile doc rich mississippi river water recharges the mraa along a cut bank this river sourced doc subsequently drives microbial mediated reductive dissolution of fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides that release sorbed and or co precipitated as to mraa groundwaters 2 hydrogeology of the study site the study site is located in eastern iberville parish louisiana along the west bank of the mississippi river and within the mississippi river alluvial valley fig 1 we focus on the mississippi river alluvial aquifer mraa formerly known as the plaquemine aquifer which consists of 90 to 270 m of unconsolidated early illinoian to late wisconsin age braided stream deposits chiefly consisting of gravels and sands that grade upward to silty sands and minor sandy silts aslan and autin 1999 borrok et al 2018 mcfarlan and leroy 1988 welch and hanor 2011 whiteman 1972 the pleistocene gravels and sands of the mraa overlie roughly 4 km of consolidated to poorly consolidated older paleogene fluvial deltaic siltstones and transgressive marine shales aslan and autin 1999 borrok et al 2018 welch and hanor 2011 at the study site the mraa is overlain by a ca 31 m thick confining layer that is composed of dense holocene clay the contact between the pleistocene gravels and sands of the mraa and the holocene clay is characterized by a ca 2 m thick oxidized silty clay to sandy silt layer with abundant fe iii oxide oxyhydroxide coatings on the mineral grains see ellinger 2004 kesel 2008 thus at the field site the mraa is a confined aquifer consisting of a sequence of oxidized pleistocene coarse grained sediments deposited in the lower deltaic and alluvial valley channel from 11 000 to 39 000 cal yr b p i e calibrated or calendar years before the present kesel 2008 whiteman 1972 in iberville parish the mississippi river is a losing stream such that the river is a major source of recharge to the mraa welch and hanor 2011 whiteman 1972 this is in part due to the fact that the mississippi river is sufficiently deep that it has cut down through the holocene confining clay and into the mraa so that it is hydraulically connected to the mraa fig 1c consequently groundwater flow in the mraa is largely controlled by the mississippi river stage which varies annually from 2 m to more than 10 m navd88 welch 2009 welch and hanor 2011 discharge of the mraa in the region chiefly occurs to the west via the atchafalaya river fig 1 which has an average river stage of ca 3 m thus the difference in stage of these two rivers produces a mean hydraulic gradient of 0 002 which drives groundwater flow away from the mississippi river and toward the atchafalaya river except for relatively uncommon occasions when the mississippi river stage is especially low fig 1 welch and hanor 2011 whiteman 1972 the mean groundwater flow velocity in the mraa is estimated to be 0 3 m day 1 ellinger 2004 and the permeability is around 1 darcy welch and hanor 2011 whiteman 1972 the region is characterized by a humid subtropical climate with an average rainfall of ca 1 5 m annually high relative humidity and temperature ranging between 11 c and 28 c whiteman 1972 groundwater from the mraa has moderate to high hardness avg 308 mg kg 1 n 6 highly variable fe concentrations mean 1σ 39 48 µmol kg 1 n 40 moderate alkalinity avg 5 18 mmol kg 1 as hco3 n 6 moderate total dissolved solids avg 305 mg kg 1 n 6 and circumneutral ph avg 6 91 n 6 borrok et al 2018 ldeq 2003 whiteman 1972 two small distributary channels bayou jacob and bayou plaquemine are located south of most wells sampled in this study these bayous have been waterways and commercial transport routes since the early 1700s ralston 1912 walley 2013 however a natural levee and a freshwater lock were built to close the mouth of the bayou with the mississippi river due to persistent flooding by the river in the early 1900s walley 2013 currently the bayou plaquemine channel is ca 3 m deep and 30 m wide ralston 1912 both bayous are no longer active distributaries of the lower mississippi river whiteman 1972 the plaquemine field site studied here differs from the majority of locations investigated in south and southeast asia and southern louisiana in that the highest groundwater as concentrations are associated with the red to brown colored oxidized late pleistocene sands of the mraa and not the overlying gray reduced holocene deposits kesel 2008 3 methods and data sources groundwater concentration data for as fe and mn for 40 wells sampled in mraa beneath plaquemines louisiana were provided by the louisiana department of environmental quality hanor 2014 ldeq 2003 the groundwater samples provided by the ldeq were collected and analyzed between december 2001 and february 2002 additional inorganic geochemical data for groundwater from these wells were not available chiefly because they do not exist to the best of our knowledge consequently to supplement these data we sampled six other wells i e wells sw 1 6 in july 2014 for as concentrations and

specific conductivity in μs cm 1 were determined at each well head after purging the well until ph specific conductivity and temperature stabilized using a multimeter sonde hydrolab minisonde 5 that

spectrophotometer hach dr 2800 via the 1 10 phenanthroline method for fe ii and the ferrozine method after reduction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride for fetotal eaton et al 1995 hach 2007 stookey 1970 detection limits for fe ii and fetotal are 0 36 μmol kg 1 and 0 16 μmol kg 1 respectively haque et al 2008 dissolved sulfide i e ʃs ii was measured on separate filtered aliquots with the portable uv vis spectrophotometer using the methylene blue method for which the detection limit is 0 16 μmol kg 1 cline 1969 eaton et al 1995 arsenic species were separated in the field by passing filtered groundwater through anion exchange columns packed with biorad ag 1 8 50 100 mesh acetate form following techniques described previously datta et al 2011 haque et al 2008 haque and johannesson 2006 johannesson et al 2019 wilkie and hering 1996 more specifically groundwater samples for as species analyses were first filtered as described above and acidified to ph 3 5 with ultrapure hno3 before passing through the anion exchange columns at ph 3 5 as iii exists as fully protonated arsenous acid h3asiiio3 0 which readily passes through the column and is then collected in pre cleaned 30 ml amber hdpe bottles acidified to ph 2 with ultrapure hno3 and stored cold ca 4 c until analysis pentavalent as v however exists as deprotonated arsenic acid at ph 3 5 i e h2asvo4 which is adsorbed on the column wilkie and hering 1998 subsequently dissolved total as astotal and as iii along with fe and mn concentrations were measured by high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hr icp ms thermo fisher element 2 at tulane university following procedures described previously haque et al 2008 datta et al 2011 leybourne et al 2014 yang et al 2015b 2016 the as v concentration is then calculated by difference using as v astotal as iii subsequently the spatial distribution of as fe and mn concentrations was analyzed using geostatistical methods in arcgis the dataset contains groundwater parameters and spatial coordinates for all wells sampled in the plaquemine louisiana area specifically to investigate the spatial distribution of as fe and mn concentrations in wells from the study area we used the geostatistical wizard and methods in arcgis 10 6 i e kriging cokriging empirical bayesian kriging and inverse distance weighting to evaluate the dataset the inverse distance weighted idw method was suitable for our multivariate and log normal distributed dataset producing relatively smooth i e data iteration converges interpolation maps esri 2019a several studies have described the idw method in arcgis has an advanced deterministic interpolator for multivariate data see shepard 1968 zhang et al 2011 fiannacca et al 2017 the idw interpolates the concentration between known sample point locations in the study area using a weighted average of the neighboring data points within a defined radius see gnanachandrasamy et al 2015 esri 2019a therefore idw was the only ideal method for our limited and sparsely distributed data points across the study area zhang 2006 karami et al 2018 next we used the band collection tool in arcgis pro to determine the statistical parameters i e minimum maximum mean and standard deviation covariance cov and correlation r or corr between interpolated as fe and mn maps then we normalized each interpolation surface s concentration values to a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 1 the following equation was developed to produce the normalized interpolation maps n o r m a l i z e d in t e r p o l a t i o n ma p idw interpolation m i n i m u m b a n d w i d t h maximum bandwidth m i n i m u m b a n d w i d t h where minimum and maximum bandwidths are the lowest and highest cell values of pixels in the raster layer respectively note that the covariance of two layers is the intersection of a spatially overlapping row and column the covariance between layers a and b is the same as the covariance between layer b and a the values in the covariance matrix are based on the value units while the values of the correlation matrix are not esri 2019b snedecor and cochran 1968 see equation for covariance in raster form cov ij k 1 n z ik μ i z jk μ j n 1 where z the value of cell i j are layers of a stack µ is the mean of a layer n is the number of cells and k denotes a particular cell the correlation matrix shows the values of the correlation coefficients that depict the relationship between two raster layers in our case the determination of correlation was based on the cell values from one raster layer related to another raster layer s cell values the correlation between two layers measured the dependency between the layers it is important to note that correlation in this study is the ratio of the covariance between the two layers divided by the product of their standard deviations see equation below because it is a ratio it is a unitless value that ranges from 1 no correlation to 1 strong correlation esri 2019b note that this process in gis produces a similar correlation matrix like the normal correlation statistics the equation to calculate the correlation is given below corr ij cov ij δ i δ j where cov is the covariance between the layers i j are layers of a stack and δ is the standard deviation of the layer finally we intersect the raster layers to determine the spatial correlation scorr of the normalized surfaces of fe mn and as and covariations or regions of overlapping concentration changes on a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 1 the final interpolation and intersection maps pinpoint the area s of low to high concentrations along with the spatial relationship between as fe and mn concentration maps at the plaquemine louisiana field site statistical significance and the relationship between as concentrations dependent variable y and independent variables fe x1 and mn x2 concentrations were determined using correlation and multiple regression critical value α 0 05 tool in the excel 2013 data analysis package see orlov 1996 miles and shevlin 2001 also included in the regression analysis is the analysis of variance anova and t test to show the variance of as concentrations explained by the fe and mn concentrations anova shows the relationship between the variance of a continuous dependent variable i e as and independent variables i e fe and mn as the estimated variable magnitude i e r2 beasley and schumacker 1995 thus the interpretation of r2 in the general regression model is carried over to the anova analysis of regression coefficients leitner 1979 beasley and schumacker 1995 when statistical significance exists between the variables we adjusted the critical value α 0 05 in anova and the t test to maintain a balance between type 1 and type 2 errors associated with multiple comparisons using the two post hoc tests bonferroni adjustment and holm sequential procedure see sidak 1967 holm 1979 tamhane 1996 wilcox 2008 sarkar et al 2012 for more details 4 results 4 1 arsenic concentrations and speciation arsenic concentrations ranged from 0 02 to 8 50 μmol kg 1 i e 2 to 637 µg kg 1 in groundwater from the mraa beneath plaquemine louisiana see suppl tables 1 2 to the best of our knowledge the as concentrations reported herein are among the highest observed in groundwaters from southern louisiana the only exception being a value of 10 7 µmol kg 1 i e 800 µg kg 1 described for groundwater from a well in vermilion parish johannesson et al 2019 kendrich and gobb 2005 furthermore we note that the highest as concentrations reported herein for the pleistocene mraa is more than 60 fold higher than the us epa s recommended maximum contaminant level for drinking water of 0 133 μmol kg 1 i e 10 μg kg 1 and thus could represent a potential health risk if consumed as drinking water the computed interpolation maps also show fe concentrations ranging from ca 0 43 to 179 μmol kg 1 and mn concentrations ranging from the detection limit i e 0 13 μmol kg 1 haque et al 2008 up to 9 1 μmol kg 1 for mraa groundwaters beneath plaquemine louisiana suppl table 1 moreover the highest fe and mn concentrations from all of the wells investigated are higher than the us epa s secondary drinking water standards of 5 37 μmol kg 1 and 0 91 μmol kg 1 respectively for each element the presence of dissolved fe and mn in these groundwaters supports the notion that reductive dissolution of the fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides is occurring in the mraa at the plaquemine study site we also note that elevated mn concentrations in drinking water can lead to adverse health outcomes e g avelino et al 2014 wasserman et al 2011 arsenic speciation data are presented for the six groundwater samples we collected and analyzed in 2014 for wells sw 1 through sw 6 figs 1 2 see appendix a suppl table 2 the speciation of as in groundwaters from these six sw wells is highly variable with as v being the predominant form in four of the six groundwater samples and as iii accounting for the majority of as in solution in two groundwater samples fig 2 more specifically as iii accounts for ca 16 and 82 of the total dissolved as i e mean 1σ 38 4 24 4 as iii whereas as v accounts for ca 18 and 84 of the total dissolved as in each of the sw wells with a mean 1σ 61 6 24 4 as as v the mixed redox conditions of the mraa beneath plaquemine louisiana as suggested by the as speciation analyses is somewhat at odds with the results of an earlier investigation of as speciation in the mraa in southern arkansas which showed a predominance of as v in solution sharif et al 2008 total dissolved sulfide concentrations also varied greatly in the sw well groundwaters ranging from below detection i e 0 16 μmol kg 1 up to 1 7 μmol kg 1 with a mean 1σ 0 56 0 64 μmol kg 1 see suppl table 2 this mean concentration was calculated following the approach of farnham et al 2002 where the groundwater samples with s ii values below detection were replaced with values equal to one half the detection limit 4 2 spatial relationships results of the geospatial and geostatistical analyses as well as the corresponding interpolated concentrations for as fe and mn for the 46 well water samples across the study site are presented in fig 3 the well locations and their respective as concentrations are displayed in 5 classes with different class intervals based on the us epa s maximum contaminant level for as of 0 133 µmol kg 1 i e 10 μg kg 1 and distribution of interpolated concentrations the interpolated maps show that high as fe and mn concentrations occur in mraa groundwaters from along the mississippi river s cut bank for example almost all the very high as occurs in well waters from near the riverbank these findings are similar to those reported by borrok et al 2018 the high groundwater fe is more broadly distributed and exhibits a somewhat linear albeit wide trend from the river toward the sw manganese is more patchy with hot spots of elevated concentrations associated with specific wells concentrations of as fe and mn generally decrease with distance from the mississippi river which is consistent with decreasing concentrations with flow down gradient along the predominant groundwater flow path fig 1 welch and hanor 2011 whiteman 1972 high concentrations of all three trace elements occur close to the intersections of bayous jacob and plaquemines with the mississippi river regions of the mraa characterized by high groundwater as concentrations broadly correlate visually with the aquifer regions where groundwaters also exhibit high dissolved fe and mn concentrations figs 3 4 for interpolated maps fig 3a c as well as the intersection maps fig 4a c low values are indicated by cool colors blue green whereas high concentrations are depicted in warm colors yellow orange red furthermore fig 4a c shows the spatial correlation scorr of the regions within the study site where groundwater as and fe as and mn and as fe and mn are strongly correlated respectively note that the 0 to 1 values on the legend in fig 4 a c are not the same as statistically calculated r but are instead normalized as fe mn concentrations warm colors indicate the cells where high normalized values of as spatially intersect high values of fe fig 4a and mn fig 4b finally fig 4c is where high values for the three variables co occurred inspection of the intersection maps shows more areas with normalized values between 0 and 0 5 for as and fe as and mn and as fe and mn than normalized values between 0 5 and 1 for the same comparisons fig 4 however the as and mn intersection maps exhibit broad areas with scorr greater than 0 5 fig 4b when compared to the identical intersection map for as and fe spatial correlation fig 4a the three intersection maps fig 4a c show the highest normalized values between as fe and mn in groundwaters from near the riverbank and proximal to the sharp bend in the mississippi river and lower normalized values in the northern and southern areas of the study site alongside the spatial visualization of the intersection maps in fig 4 we also explore statistical evidence of the relationship between the three variables the text output from the statistics band collection analysis in arcgis version 10 6 table 1 reveals that the spatial relationship between as and fe is stronger i e r 0 710 than the spatial relationship between as and mn i e r 0 404 overall the interpolated intersection maps validated by the statistical band analyses of as fe and mn raster layers indicate spatial correlations that are less than 0 5 i e scorr 0 5 across large portions of the study site and high normalized values i e scorr 1 near the mississippi riverbank fig 4 we further validated the arcgis statistical result with a correlation multiple regression analysis in excel to predict the effect of iron and manganese concentration on arsenic concentration see appendix a suppl table 3a d a statistically significant regression equation was found f 2 37 21 887 p 0 000 with a correlation r of 0 736 the groundwaters predicted arsenic in µmol kg 1 is equal to 1 304 0 016 fe 0 42 mn when fe and mn are measured in µmol kg 1 both fe and mn were significant predictors of arsenic with the calculated statistical significance between as and fe concentrations pas fe 0 0005 as and mn concentrations pas mn 0 0005 and as fe and mn concentrations pas fe mn 0 0005 the three variable combinations also indicated statistical significance at the adjusted critical value α 0 017 for bonferroni adjustment and α 0 05 for holm sequential procedure 5 discussion as mentioned earlier the arsenic concentrations reported for groundwater wells in plaquemine louisiana represent some of the highest as concentrations measured to date in louisiana groundwaters borrok et al 2018 johannesson et al 2019 yang et al 2014 2015a 2016 moreover these data show that the highest as concentration measured in groundwaters from the pleistocene mraa i e 8 5 µmol kg 1 is ca 64 fold higher than the current mcl for as in drinking waters set by the us epa and similar to as concentrations measured in groundwaters from the ganges delta in west bengal india e g datta et al 2011 mohajerin et al 2013 sankar et al 2014 and references therein high as concentrations i e up to 1 0 μmol kg 1 or 77 μg kg 1 were also reported for groundwaters from the mraa in southeastern arkansas sharif et al 2008 and in east baton rouge parish louisiana just to the north of our study site where an as concentration of 0 86 μmol kg 1 i e 64 3 μg l 1 is reported borrok et al 2018 however unlike the mraa beneath plaquemine la where the aquifer is confined beneath approximately 20 35 m of holocene silts and clays kesel 2008 welch and hanor 2011 whiteman 1972 the confining silts and clays are either absent or at most 12 m thick in southern arkansas sharif et al 2008 based on the interpolation and intersection maps figs 3 4 we suggest that the high arsenic concentrations in mraa groundwater beneath plaquemine la is consistent with the reductive dissolution of fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides followed by the release of sorbed and or co precipitated as into the groundwaters on average the majority of as in groundwaters from the sw wells is as v but mixed redox conditions are clearly present across the study area hence the redox conditions of the sw well groundwaters may not reflect the as redox speciation near the mississippi riverbank where as concentrations are highest and groundwater is likely more reducing this is because depending on ph as v is generally more strongly adsorbed onto fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides and other minerals in aquifer sediments than as iii chakraborty et al 2007 dixit and hering 2003 johannesson et al 2019 thus based on the spatial correlations between the as fe and mn maps we infer that mobilization of as occurs near the riverbank but the mobilized as is largely re adsorbed onto existing fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides and or re precipitated with neo formed fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides with flow down gradient away from the mississippi river see figs 1 3 4 specifically the highest spatial correlations i e the scorr value of 1 between as fe and mn concentrations occur proximal to the mississippi river whereas spatial correlations weaken with distance from the river see fig 4a c the fact that the highest as fe and mn concentrations occur right near the mississippi river riverbank suggests that the interaction of the river water with the aquifer or possibly the oxidized silty clay to sandy silt layer that occurs at the contact between the mraa sands and the overlying holocene confining layer may be responsible for fe iii and possibly mn iv reduction and subsequent as mobilization e g nicholas et al 2017 borrok et al 2018 wallis et al 2020 the mississippi river is sufficiently deep at the field site that it has cut through the confining layer and is in contact with mraa fig 1c welch and hanor 2011 whiteman 1972 although high groundwater as fe and mn concentrations are located near where bayou jacob and bayou plaquemine historically connected to the mississippi river the bayous are not likely contributing substantial recharge to the mraa because both have a maximum depth of around 8 m and thus do not cut through the ca 30 m thick confining layer on top of the mraa ralston 1912 walley 2013 nevertheless additional investigation of the hydrogeology and particularly the hydrologic properties of the confining clay beneath these bayous is necessary to confirm this assumption borrok et al 2018 also reported that the highest as concentrations in groundwaters from the mraa occurred in well waters collected near the mississippi river including the west bank of the river in east baton rouge parish and into eastern iberville parish see their fig 7 stable water isotope analyses i e δ18o δd of mraa groundwaters and waters from the mississippi river indicate that the high as groundwaters near the river are hydraulically connected to the river such that much of this groundwater is in fact recharged mississippi river water borrok et al 2018 for example high as groundwaters from the mraa near the river in iberville parish have a mean δ18o 37 8 and mean δd 6 08 relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow which compare favorably to the mean 1σ n 4 δ18o and δd values of mississippi river waters of 42 5 1 21 and 6 4 0 9 respectively borrok et al 2018 mississippi river water the high as iberville groundwaters and other mraa groundwaters from near the riverbank plot along or close to the national meteoric water line i e kendall and coplen 2001 the negative δ18o and δd values of the mississippi river waters and iberville parish mraa groundwaters reflect their origins as meteoric precipitation from further inland and north within the mississippi river watershed borrok et al 2018 by comparison the less negative δ18o and δd values of mraa groundwaters collected further away from the mississippi river appear to be mixtures of local meteoric precipitation and river water see fig 5 in borrok et al 2018 the geostatistical and geospatial relationships support although cannot prove our hypotheses that reductive dissolution of fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides is likely the chief mechanism by which as is mobilized into mraa groundwater at the plaquemine study site although the correlation coefficients between as fe and mn are not exceptionally high 0 7 they are spatially related and statistically significant pas fe 0 0005 pas mn 0 0005 and pas fe mn 0 0005 at the 95 confidence level see appendix a suppl table 3 the p values show there is a linear relationship between the as and fe or mn concentrations furthermore moderate to strong correlation coefficients between as and fe or mn in groundwater can be attributed to the different behavior of each element in solution once mobilized in non sulfidic waters and at neutral ph as iii occurs as the arsenite oxyanion h3asiiio3 0 whereas as v occurs as various ionized forms of the arsenate oxyanion e g h2asvo4 hasvo4 2 e g dixit and hering 2003 lu and zhu 2011 smedley 2008 the ionized nature of the arsenate oxyanion in circumneutral ph water explains in part its particle reactivity and strong surface complexation onto fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides e g dixit and hering 2003 goldberg 2002 johannesson et al 2019 manning and goldberg 1997 mohajerin et al 2013 2014 pierce and moore 1982 because the un ionized arsenite oxyanion is less particle reactive than the ionized arsenate oxyanion at the ph of the sw well groundwaters it is likely to be more readily transported with flowing groundwater than arsenate e g johannesson et al 2019 in contrast both fe and mn form divalent cations in anaerobic waters that are strongly adsorbed at circumneutral ph but likely occur as colloidal materials in oxygenated waters e g smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the concurrently mobilized fe ii may subsequently be removed from solution by re adsorption onto fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides remaining in the aquifer sediments or via precipitation of secondary fe ii bearing minerals like siderite vivianite and or as fe sulfide minerals e g mackinawite greigite and or pyrite when sulfate reduction is important burton et al 2007 horneman et al 2004 kocar et al 2010 mcarthur et al 2001 zachara et al 2002 geochemical modeling of the mraa beneath plaquemine louisiana using our geochemical analyses which includes arsenic and iron speciation data of the sw wells see suppl table 2 and the average major ion concentration data for the mraa from sharif et al 2008 and adebayo et al 2018 was undertaken using the spece8 program of the geochemist s workbench release 14 0 1 bethke et al 2020 our goal here is to evaluate likely mineral saturation states in the mraa beneath plaquemine louisiana to inform on possible controls on dissolved fe mn and as concentrations in the mraa groundwaters suppl tables 4 5 the lawrence livermore national laboratory thermochemical database delany and lundeen 1989 provided with the software i e thermo tdat was modified as described in yang et al 2015b based on the model the sw groundwaters are saturated with respect to siderite feco3 sisiderite 0 29 0 27 where si saturation index log q k the modeling also indicates that groundwaters from the sw wells are all substantially undersaturated with respect to all arsenic minerals included in the modeling including realgar sirealgar 4 78 0 86 scorodite siscorodite 6 99 0 69 and orpiment siorpiment 10 6 2 09 hence the moderate spatial correlations between fe and as in mraa groundwaters may reflect precipitation of secondary siderite and pyrite which is highly oversaturated in groundwaters from the sw wells sipyrite 5 08 1 08 both fe ii and fe iii may also be transported with flowing groundwater in the mraa as organic complexes because both ferric and ferrous iron form strong complexes with dissolved organic matter dupré et al 1999 tipping et al 2002 laglera and van den berg 2009 daugherty et al 2017 furthermore differences in the adsorption behavior of as iii and as v as well as fe ii and fe iii likely play a role in the moderate correlations between the total dissolved as and fe concentrations in mraa groundwaters beneath plaquemine louisiana see johannesson et al 2019 although the geochemical modeling indicates that the sw groundwaters are slightly undersaturated with respect to rhodochrosite mnco3 sirhodochrosite 0 45 0 18 the possibility that mn concentrations are limited by a mn phosphate phase cannot be ruled out suppl table 5 however to the best of our knowledge phosphate concentrations have not been determined in groundwaters from our study area and thus the use of the mean po4 3 concentrations determined by sharif et al 2008 for the mraa in southeastern arkansas for our modeling is at best inconclusive hence the saturation indexes computed for vivianite presented in appendix a suppl table 5 should be viewed with caution the proximity of the highest as fe and mn concentrations to the mississippi river suggests that the river likely plays a role in generating the high as concentrations of the studied groundwater system we suggest that labile organic matter from the river may enter the aquifer and fuel this reductive dissolution specifically the influx of dissolved organic carbon doc from the mississippi river or the river bottom muds into the sandy and oxidized mraa e g kesel 2008 could partially drive microbial respiration of fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides within the aquifer sediments mobilizing absorbed and or co precipitated as into the mraa groundwaters wallis et al 2020 we note that the δ13c values of dissolved inorganic carbon in groundwaters from the mraa are reported to range from 17 4 to 11 1 relative to vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb which indicates that hco3 in these groundwaters reflects both microbial respiration of organic matter as well as aquifer mineral weathering borrok et al 2018 hence the δ13c values provide evidence that microbial reduction of oxidants like fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides and so4 2 occurs within the mraa of louisiana these oxidants may already exist within the mraa sediments i e fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides kesel 2008 sharif et al 2008 or be carried in by recharging river waters as dissolved species e g no3 so4 2 or as colloidal fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides stolpe et al 2010 wallis et al 2020 alternatively these oxidants and the labile organic matter may be sourced at least in part in river bottoms muds where the river is hydraulically connected to the aquifer see wallis et al 2020 although we did not measure doc in the mississippi river others report that it typically ranges from ca 65 µmol kg 1 in the winter to ca 359 µmol kg 1 in the summer benner and opsahl 2001 the seasonal variations in total doc concentrations in the lower mississippi river reflect both autochthonous and allochthonous sources primarily derived from the upper mississippi river and its tributaries waterson and canuel 2008 other investigators report that autochthonous doc mostly algal derived and phytoplankton is more biologically available i e labile than allochthonous doc in the mississippi river bianchi et al 2004 chen and gardner 2004 in the lower mississippi river doc is chiefly derived from allochthonous sources during high water discharge via surface runoffs whereas more labile autochthonous doc comes from in situ algal production that is highest during low water discharge periods duan and bianchi 2007 hence these studies show that the mixed sources of doc in the lower mississippi river are due to the seasonal shifts in concentration of doc and sporadic inputs of terrestrial doc from tributaries and runoff from wetlands and forest soils across the mississippi river valley watershed duan and bianchi 2007 duan et al 2007a therefore as dagg et al 2005 argued the principal source of doc within the lower mississippi river at any given time can be unclear owing to seasonal variations in river flow dissolved load and photosynthesis extended residence times can also increase the in situ production of more labile algal sourced doc and also produce more labile forms of doc by photochemical decomposition of terrestrially derived doc cai et al 2015 duan et al 2007b nonetheless these studies indicate that an important portion of the doc carried by the mississippi river is labile which can be readily degraded by microbes consequently we submit that the introduction of labile forms of doc into the mraa by river recharge of the aquifer could fuel microbial oxidation of this labile organic carbon coupled to fe iii mn iv oxide oxyhydroxide reduction this process would subsequently release as associated with these metal oxides oxyhydroxides into the mraa groundwaters we note that sharif et al 2008 also argued that the reductive dissolution of fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides in the mraa was responsible for the as mobilization that produced the high groundwater as concentrations in southern arkansas the importance of reductive dissolution of fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides as the chief mechanism of as mobilization into mraa groundwaters is further supported by our previous investigations of high as groundwaters in southern louisiana for example using laboratory microcosms yang et al 2016 incubated shallow holocene sediments from napoleonville louisiana and showed that microbial respiratory processes were the likely cause of elevated as concentrations in the associated pore waters moreover johannesson et al 2019 employed a biogeochemical reactive transport model incorporating microbial respiratory kinetics and thermodynamics that was able to reproduce elevated as iii and as v concentrations in shallow groundwaters from the holocene upper chicot aquifer in southern louisiana hence the spatial relationships between groundwater as fe and mn concentrations within the mraa beneath plaquemine louisiana and the stable carbon and water isotope ratios from borrok et al 2018 we submit that recharge of the aquifer by mississippi river waters supplies labile doc that fuels microbial reduction of fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides within the oxidized aquifer sediments e g kesel 2008 that subsequently releases as that was sorbed onto and or co precipitated with these metal oxides oxyhydroxides confirmation of this mechanism will require additional study of the mraa groundwaters and the aquifer sediments beneath plaquemine louisiana nonetheless investigations by sharif et al 2008 and borrok et al 2018 in the mraa as well as a recent study of groundwater as mobilization along the red river in vietnam wallis et al 2020 all support the likelihood that river water recharge of local aquifers can import labile forms of organic matter and oxidants that fuel reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides and the subsequent release of sorbed and or co precipitated as to groundwaters the possibility of groundwater flow reversals e g whiteman 1972 discharging high as groundwaters into the mississippi river is countered by the relative rarity of such events owing to the highly controlled flows within the river to ensure navigability by ocean going vessels as well as the high probability of dilution of any high as groundwater that enters the river by the immense volumes of water transported by the river e g river discharge 530 109 m3 year 1 mckee et al 2004 this is further supported by the low as concentrations that have been measured in the mississippi river for example borrok et al 2018 were unable to detect as in the four mississippi river water samples they analyzed using icp optical emission spectroscopy reporting that as concentrations were always less than 0 133 μmol kg 1 10 μg l 1 likewise telfeyan et al 2018 reported that the as concentrations of six of the eight mississippi river water samples collected near new orleans were below the detection limit of 6 74 10 4 μmol kg 1 i e 0 05 μg l 1 using hr icp ms the two river samples with detectable arsenic had concentrations of 0 0022 μmol kg 1 i e 0 16 μg l 1 and 0 015 μmol kg 1 i e 1 1 μg l 1 telfeyan et al 2018 finally the geostatistical and geospatial results support the possibility that labile organic matter from the mississippi river fuels reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides oxyhydroxides within the pleistocene sands of the mraa releasing as into the groundwater system the fact that as concentrations decrease dramatically with distance away from the riverbank suggests that the mobilized as is subsequently re adsorbed onto fe mn oxides oxyhydroxides further downgradient along the flow path e g johannesson et al 2019 strong re adsorption of as is consistent with our speciation analysis of groundwaters from the sw wells which reveals that although mixed as v is generally the chief form of as in mraa groundwaters the decrease in fe concentrations away from the riverbank may also reflect re adsorption onto existing fe oxides oxyhydroxides e g horneman et al 2004 postma et al 2007 2010 tufano and fendorf 2008 wallis et al 2020 or precipitation of secondary minerals like siderite and or pyrite as mraa groundwater are saturated to oversaturated respectively with these fe ii bearing minerals see appendix a suppl table 5 6 conclusions arsenic concentrations in groundwater from the mississippi river alluvial aquifer mraa beneath plaquemine louisiana reach concentrations as high as 8 50 μmol kg 1 i e 637 μg kg 1 which is a ca 64 fold higher than the maximum contaminant level for as in drinking water recognized by the us epa and who the plaquemine site differs from the majority of locations investigated in southern louisiana in that the elevated groundwater as concentrations occur in the late pleistocene sands of the mraa which are characterized by abundant fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides e g aslan and autin 1999 kesel 2008 sharif et al 2008 2011 borrok et al 2018 because pleistocene aquifers of south and southeast asia are currently viewed as safe sources of drinking water the source of as contamination in the pleistocene sands of the mraa in plaquemine louisiana warrants investigation and may provide insights for the use of groundwater in similar pleistocene aquifers from around the world the results of geospatial and geostatistical analyses are consistent with the notion that recharge of the aquifer by mississippi river water introduces labile doc into the mraa that subsequently fuels microbial respiration and mobilizes reductive dissolution of sorbed and or co precipitated as into the groundwater reducing conditions are consistent with introducing labile forms of doc either autochthonous or allochthonous from the lower mississippi river that recharges the mraa the doc serves as the electron donor in the pleistocene sands of the mraa beneath plaquemine louisiana mobilized as may then be re adsorbed onto mraa sediments further down gradient along the predominant flow path if this conceptual model is correct then as fe iii and mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides are stripped from the mraa sediments over time by microbially driven reductive dissolution arsenic may migrate further down gradient to more rural areas to the southwest where homeowners rely on shallow private wells for their water supply whiteman 1972 though the exact source s and chemical conditions or reactions leading to the elevated as concentrations in the mraa as well as the as mobilization processes are still unclear our investigation demonstrates that similar pleistocene aquifer sands such as those of south and southeast asia may also be a source of geogenic as if the redox conditions change to lower more reducing conditions credit authorship contribution statement omolola a akintomide methodology formal

4773,geostatistical and geospatial analysis techniques were employed to evaluate relationships between high arsenic as iron fe and manganese mn concentrations in groundwaters from the pleistocene mississippi river alluvial aquifer mraa in south central louisiana the mraa is recharged by the mississippi river and its groundwater contains fe concentrations that range from 0 43 to 179 µmol kg 1 n

the total dissolved as mean 1σ 61 6 24 4 n 6 spatial distributions of as fe and mn concentrations suggest that the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides oxyhydroxides is the likely source of as to the mraa groundwaters geostatistical and geospatial analyses were employed to produce interpolation maps that show concentrations of as fe and mn decrease with distance from the mississippi river spatial correlations are stronger between groundwater as and fe concentrations r 0 710 pas fe 0 0005 than those between the as and mn concentrations r 0 404 pas mn 0 0005 more specifically regions of the mraa characterized by high dissolved as concentrations spatially correlate with regions of high dissolved fe concentrations and to a lesser degree high dissolved mn concentrations we hypothesize that recharge of the mraa by mississippi river water introduces labile organic carbon into the mraa that subsequently fuels microbial respiration which reduces fe mn oxides oxyhydroxides and mobilizes adsorbed and or co precipitated as into mraa groundwaters once mobilized as is transported away from the riverbank by flowing groundwaters but is rapidly removed from solution by re adsorption onto fe mn oxides oxyhydroxides within the regionally oxidized aquifer sediments our investigation indicates that oxidized pleistocene sand aquifers in large river delta plains can also produce groundwater

subaerial weathering conditions conducive to the precipitation of fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides e g mcarthur et al 2008 arsenic adsorbs strongly onto fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides surfaces and can occur within the lattice structure as co precipitates whereas labile organic matter fuels the microbial reduction of fe iii leading to as mobilization from sediments into groundwater dixit and hering 2003

yang et al 2016 accordingly one remedy that has been proposed to help address the as problems in holocene fluvial alluvial aquifers is to drill deeper wells that abstract water from the underlying organic poor pleistocene aquifers rather than the organic rich holocene aquifers that produce as contaminated groundwaters ahmed et al 2006 burgess et al 2010 neumann et al 2010 ravenscroft et al 2005 yang et al 2014 southern louisiana shares strikingly similar geology and hydrogeology e g aquifer groundwater chemistry sediment characteristics deltaic and floodplain sedimentary depositional environments and organic matter content with the large river delta systems of south and southeast asia including high as groundwaters borrok et al 2018 johannesson et al 2019 yang et al 2014 2016 moreover our previous research on shallow holocene sediments from napoleonville louisiana and the upper chicot aquifer in cow island louisiana indicate that microbial reduction of fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides is the likely mechanism responsible for as mobilization into shallow groundwaters at these sites johannesson et al 2019 yang et al 2014 similar conclusions were reported by borrok et al 2018 for the pleistocene mississippi river alluvial aquifer mraa in louisiana and by sharif et al 2008 for the mraa in southern arkansas furthermore yang et al 2014 predicted that much of southern louisiana might be underlain by shallow groundwater with elevated as concentrations higher than 133 nmol kg 1 i e 10 µg kg 1 which is the maximum safe drinking water standard for human consumption recommended by the united states environmental protection agency us epa and world health organization who usepa 2001 thus it is reasonable to expect that the same or similar biogeochemical processes that lead to as mobilization into shallow groundwater at napoleonville and cow island louisiana as well as the mraa also act to mobilize as into groundwaters across much of southern louisiana borrok et al 2018 johannesson et al 2019 yang et al 2014 2016 in this contribution we present as fe and manganese mn concentration data provided by the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq as well as arsenic speciation analyses used in conjunction with the larger ldeq dataset for groundwater from the pleistocene mraa adjacent to the mississippi river near baton rouge louisiana the overall objective of this study is to demonstrate that pleistocene aquifer sands of the mraa that are rich in fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides i e kesel 2008 can also produce high as groundwaters when these sands are exposed to labile forms of organic matter or other reducing agents that can mediate reductive dissolution of the as bearing fe mn oxides oxyhydroxides we show using geostatistical and geospatial tools in conjunction with the current understanding of the regional groundwater flow regime e g borrok et al 2018 kolker et al 2013 welch and hanor 2011 whiteman 1972 that the spatial distribution of as fe and mn in groundwaters of the mraa proximal to the mississippi river are consistent with our conceptual model whereby labile doc rich mississippi river water recharges the mraa along a cut bank this river sourced doc subsequently drives microbial mediated reductive dissolution of fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides that release sorbed and or co precipitated as to mraa groundwaters 2 hydrogeology of the study site the study site is located in eastern iberville parish louisiana along the west bank of the mississippi river and within the mississippi river alluvial valley fig 1 we focus on the mississippi river alluvial aquifer mraa formerly known as the plaquemine aquifer which consists of 90 to 270 m of unconsolidated early illinoian to late wisconsin age braided stream deposits chiefly consisting of gravels and sands that grade upward to silty sands and minor sandy silts aslan and autin 1999 borrok et al 2018 mcfarlan and leroy 1988 welch and hanor 2011 whiteman 1972 the pleistocene gravels and sands of the mraa overlie roughly 4 km of consolidated to poorly consolidated older paleogene fluvial deltaic siltstones and transgressive marine shales aslan and autin 1999 borrok et al 2018 welch and hanor 2011 at the study site the mraa is overlain by a ca 31 m thick confining layer that is composed of dense holocene clay the contact between the pleistocene gravels and sands of the mraa and the holocene clay is characterized by a ca 2 m thick oxidized silty clay to sandy silt layer with abundant fe iii oxide oxyhydroxide coatings on the mineral grains see ellinger 2004 kesel 2008 thus at the field site the mraa is a confined aquifer consisting of a sequence of oxidized pleistocene coarse grained sediments deposited in the lower deltaic and alluvial valley channel from 11 000 to 39 000 cal yr b p i e calibrated or calendar years before the present kesel 2008 whiteman 1972 in iberville parish the mississippi river is a losing stream such that the river is a major source of recharge to the mraa welch and hanor 2011 whiteman 1972 this is in part due to the fact that the mississippi river is sufficiently deep that it has cut down through the holocene confining clay and into the mraa so that it is hydraulically connected to the mraa fig 1c consequently groundwater flow in the mraa is largely controlled by the mississippi river stage which varies annually from 2 m to more than 10 m navd88 welch 2009 welch and hanor 2011 discharge of the mraa in the region chiefly occurs to the west via the atchafalaya river fig 1 which has an average river stage of ca 3 m thus the difference in stage of these two rivers produces a mean hydraulic gradient of 0 002 which drives groundwater flow away from the mississippi river and

borrok et al 2018 ldeq 2003 whiteman 1972 two small distributary channels bayou jacob and bayou plaquemine are located south of most wells sampled in this study these bayous have been waterways and commercial transport routes since the early 1700s ralston 1912 walley 2013 however a natural levee and a freshwater lock were built to close the mouth of the bayou with the mississippi river due to persistent flooding by the river in the early 1900s walley 2013 currently the bayou plaquemine channel is ca 3 m deep and 30 m wide ralston 1912 both bayous are no longer active distributaries of the lower mississippi river whiteman 1972 the plaquemine field site studied here differs from the majority of locations investigated in south and southeast asia and southern louisiana in that the highest groundwater as concentrations are associated with the red to brown colored oxidized late pleistocene sands of the mraa and not the overlying gray reduced holocene deposits kesel 2008 3 methods and data sources groundwater concentration data for as fe and mn for 40 wells sampled in mraa beneath plaquemines louisiana were provided by the louisiana department of environmental quality hanor 2014 ldeq 2003 the groundwater samples provided by the ldeq were collected and analyzed between december 2001 and february 2002 additional inorganic geochemical data for groundwater from these wells were not available chiefly because they do not exist to the best of our knowledge consequently to supplement these data we sampled six other wells i e wells sw 1 6 in july 2014 for as concentrations and

specific conductivity in μs cm 1 were determined at each well head after purging the well until ph specific conductivity and temperature stabilized using a multimeter sonde hydrolab minisonde 5 that

1970 detection limits for fe ii and fetotal are 0 36 μmol kg 1 and 0 16 μmol kg 1 respectively haque et al 2008 dissolved sulfide i e ʃs ii was measured on separate filtered aliquots with the portable uv vis spectrophotometer using the methylene blue method for which the detection limit is 0 16 μmol kg 1 cline 1969 eaton et al 1995 arsenic species were separated in the field by passing filtered groundwater through anion exchange columns packed with biorad ag 1 8 50 100 mesh acetate form following techniques described previously datta et al 2011 haque et al 2008 haque and johannesson 2006 johannesson et al 2019 wilkie and hering 1996 more specifically groundwater samples for as species analyses were first filtered as described above and acidified to ph 3 5 with ultrapure hno3 before passing through the anion exchange columns at ph 3 5 as iii exists as fully protonated arsenous acid h3asiiio3 0 which readily passes through the column and is then collected in pre cleaned 30 ml amber hdpe bottles acidified to ph 2 with ultrapure hno3 and stored cold ca 4 c until analysis pentavalent as v however exists as deprotonated arsenic acid at ph 3 5 i e h2asvo4 which is adsorbed on the column wilkie and hering 1998 subsequently dissolved total as astotal and as iii along with fe and mn concentrations were measured by high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hr icp ms thermo fisher element 2 at tulane university following procedures described previously haque et al 2008 datta et al 2011 leybourne et al 2014 yang et al 2015b 2016 the as v concentration is then calculated by difference using as v astotal as iii subsequently the spatial distribution of as fe and mn concentrations was analyzed using geostatistical methods in arcgis the dataset contains groundwater parameters and spatial coordinates for all wells sampled in the plaquemine louisiana area specifically to investigate the spatial distribution of as fe and mn concentrations in wells from the study area we used the geostatistical wizard and methods in arcgis 10 6 i e kriging cokriging empirical bayesian kriging and inverse distance weighting to evaluate the dataset the inverse distance weighted idw method was suitable for our multivariate and log normal distributed dataset producing relatively smooth i e data iteration converges interpolation maps esri 2019a several studies have described the idw method in arcgis has an advanced deterministic interpolator for multivariate data see shepard 1968 zhang et al 2011 fiannacca et al 2017 the idw interpolates the concentration between known sample point locations in the study area using a weighted average of the neighboring data points within a defined radius see gnanachandrasamy et al 2015 esri 2019a therefore idw was the only ideal method for our limited and sparsely distributed data points across the study area zhang 2006 karami et al 2018 next we used the band collection tool in arcgis pro to determine the statistical parameters i e minimum maximum mean and standard deviation covariance cov and correlation r or corr between interpolated as fe and mn maps then we normalized each interpolation surface s concentration values to a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 1 the following equation was developed to produce the normalized interpolation maps n o r m a l i z e d in t e r p o l a t i o n ma p idw interpolation m i n i m u m b a n d w i d t h maximum bandwidth m i n i m u m b a n d w i d t h where minimum and maximum bandwidths are the lowest and highest cell values of pixels in the raster layer respectively note that the covariance of two layers is the intersection of a spatially overlapping row and column the covariance between layers a and b is the same as the covariance between layer b and a the values in the covariance matrix are based on the value units while the values of the correlation matrix are not esri 2019b snedecor and cochran 1968 see equation for covariance in raster form cov ij k 1 n z ik μ i z jk μ j n 1 where z the value of cell i j are layers of a stack µ is the mean of a layer n is the number of cells and k denotes a particular cell the correlation matrix shows the values of the correlation coefficients that depict the relationship between two raster layers in our case the determination of correlation was based on the cell values from one raster layer related to another raster layer s cell values the correlation between two layers measured the dependency between the layers it is important to note that correlation in this study is the ratio of the covariance between the two layers divided by the product of their standard deviations see equation below because it is a ratio it is a unitless value that ranges from 1 no correlation to 1 strong correlation esri 2019b note that this process in gis produces a similar correlation matrix like the normal correlation statistics the equation to calculate the correlation is given below corr ij cov ij δ i δ j where cov is the covariance between the layers i j are layers of a stack and δ is the standard deviation of the layer finally we intersect the raster layers to determine the spatial correlation scorr of the normalized surfaces of fe mn and as and covariations or regions of overlapping concentration changes on a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 1 the final interpolation and intersection maps pinpoint the area s of low to high concentrations along with the spatial relationship between as fe and mn concentration maps at the plaquemine louisiana field site statistical significance and the relationship between as concentrations dependent variable y and independent variables fe x1 and mn x2 concentrations were determined using correlation and multiple regression critical value α 0 05 tool in the excel 2013 data analysis package see orlov 1996 miles and shevlin 2001 also included in the regression analysis is the analysis of variance anova and t test to show the variance of as concentrations explained by the fe and mn concentrations anova shows the relationship between the variance of a continuous dependent variable i e as and independent variables i e fe and mn as the estimated variable magnitude i e r2 beasley and schumacker 1995 thus the interpretation of r2 in the general regression model is carried over to the anova analysis of regression coefficients leitner 1979 beasley and schumacker 1995 when statistical significance exists between the variables we adjusted the critical value α 0 05 in anova and the t test to maintain a balance between type 1 and type 2 errors associated with multiple comparisons using the two post hoc tests bonferroni adjustment and holm sequential procedure see sidak 1967 holm 1979 tamhane 1996 wilcox 2008 sarkar et al 2012 for more details 4 results 4 1 arsenic concentrations and speciation arsenic concentrations ranged from 0 02 to 8 50 μmol kg 1 i e 2 to 637 µg kg 1 in groundwater from the mraa beneath plaquemine louisiana see suppl tables 1 2 to the best of our knowledge the as concentrations reported herein are among the highest observed in groundwaters from southern louisiana the only exception being a value of 10 7 µmol kg 1 i e 800 µg kg 1 described for groundwater from a well in vermilion parish johannesson et al 2019 kendrich and gobb 2005 furthermore we note that the highest as concentrations reported herein for the pleistocene mraa is more than 60 fold higher than the us epa s recommended maximum contaminant level for drinking water of 0 133 μmol kg 1 i e 10 μg kg 1 and thus could represent a potential health risk if consumed as drinking water the computed interpolation maps also show fe concentrations ranging from ca 0 43 to 179 μmol kg 1 and mn concentrations ranging from the detection limit i e 0 13 μmol kg 1 haque et al 2008 up to 9 1 μmol kg 1 for mraa groundwaters beneath plaquemine louisiana suppl table 1 moreover the highest fe and mn concentrations from all of the wells investigated are higher than the us epa s secondary drinking water standards of 5 37 μmol kg 1 and 0 91 μmol kg 1 respectively for each element the presence of dissolved fe and mn in these groundwaters supports the notion that reductive dissolution of the fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides is occurring in the mraa at the plaquemine study site we also note that elevated mn concentrations in drinking water can lead to adverse health outcomes e g avelino et al 2014 wasserman et al 2011 arsenic speciation data are presented for the six groundwater samples we collected and analyzed in 2014 for wells sw 1 through sw 6 figs 1 2 see appendix a suppl table 2 the speciation of as in groundwaters from these six sw wells is highly variable with as v being the predominant form in four of the six groundwater samples and as iii accounting for the majority of as in solution in two groundwater samples fig 2 more specifically as iii accounts for ca 16 and 82 of the total dissolved as i e mean 1σ 38 4 24 4 as iii whereas as v accounts for ca 18 and 84 of the total dissolved as in each of the sw wells with a mean 1σ 61 6 24 4 as as v the mixed redox conditions of the mraa beneath plaquemine louisiana as suggested by the as speciation analyses is somewhat at odds with the results of an earlier investigation of as speciation in the mraa in southern arkansas which showed a predominance of as v in solution sharif et al 2008 total dissolved sulfide concentrations also varied greatly in the sw well groundwaters ranging from below detection i e 0 16 μmol kg 1 up to 1 7 μmol kg 1 with a mean 1σ 0 56 0 64 μmol kg 1 see suppl table 2 this mean concentration was calculated following the approach of farnham et al 2002 where the groundwater samples with s ii values below detection were replaced with values equal to one half the detection limit 4 2 spatial relationships results of the geospatial and geostatistical analyses as well as the corresponding interpolated concentrations for as fe and mn for the 46 well water samples across the study site are presented in fig 3 the well locations and their respective as concentrations are displayed in 5 classes with different class intervals based on the us epa s maximum contaminant level for as of 0 133 µmol kg 1 i e 10 μg kg 1 and distribution of interpolated concentrations the interpolated maps show that high as fe and mn concentrations occur in mraa groundwaters from along the mississippi river s cut bank for example almost all the very high as occurs in well waters from near the riverbank these findings are similar to those reported by borrok et al 2018 the high groundwater fe is more broadly distributed and exhibits a somewhat linear albeit wide trend from the river toward the sw manganese is more patchy with hot spots of elevated concentrations associated with specific wells concentrations of as fe and mn generally decrease with distance from the mississippi river which is consistent with decreasing concentrations with flow down gradient along the predominant groundwater flow path fig 1 welch and hanor 2011 whiteman 1972 high concentrations of all three trace elements occur close to the intersections of bayous jacob and plaquemines with the mississippi river regions of the mraa characterized by high groundwater as concentrations broadly correlate visually with the aquifer regions where groundwaters also exhibit high dissolved fe and mn concentrations figs 3 4 for interpolated maps fig 3a c as well as the intersection maps fig 4a c low values are indicated by cool colors blue green whereas high concentrations are depicted in warm colors yellow orange red furthermore fig 4a c shows the spatial correlation scorr of the regions within the study site where groundwater as and fe as and mn and as fe and mn are strongly correlated respectively note that the 0 to 1 values on the legend in fig 4 a c are not the same as statistically calculated r but are instead normalized as fe mn concentrations warm colors indicate the cells where high normalized values of as spatially intersect high values of fe fig 4a and mn fig 4b finally fig 4c is where high values for the three variables co occurred inspection of the intersection maps shows more areas with normalized values between 0 and 0 5 for as and fe as and mn and as fe and mn than normalized values between 0 5 and 1 for the same comparisons fig 4 however the as and mn intersection maps exhibit broad areas with scorr greater than 0 5 fig 4b when compared to the identical intersection map for as and fe spatial correlation fig 4a the three intersection maps fig 4a c show the highest normalized values between as fe and mn in groundwaters from near the riverbank and proximal to the sharp bend in the mississippi river and lower normalized values in the northern and southern areas of the study site alongside the spatial visualization of the intersection maps in fig 4 we also explore statistical evidence of the relationship between the three variables the text output from the statistics band collection analysis in arcgis version 10 6 table 1 reveals that the spatial relationship between as and fe is stronger i e r 0 710 than the spatial relationship between as and mn i e r 0 404 overall the interpolated intersection maps validated by the statistical band analyses of as fe and mn raster layers indicate spatial correlations that are less than 0 5 i e scorr 0 5 across large portions of the study site and high normalized values i e scorr 1 near the mississippi riverbank fig 4 we further validated the arcgis statistical result with a correlation multiple regression analysis in excel to predict the effect of iron and manganese concentration on arsenic concentration see appendix a suppl table 3a d a statistically significant regression equation was found f 2 37 21 887 p 0 000 with a correlation r of 0 736 the groundwaters predicted arsenic in µmol kg 1 is equal to 1 304 0 016 fe 0 42 mn when fe and mn are measured in µmol kg 1 both fe and mn were significant predictors of arsenic with the calculated statistical significance between as and fe concentrations pas fe 0 0005 as and mn concentrations pas mn 0 0005 and as fe and mn concentrations pas fe mn 0 0005 the three variable combinations also indicated statistical significance at the adjusted critical value α 0 017 for bonferroni adjustment and α 0 05 for holm sequential procedure 5 discussion as mentioned earlier the arsenic concentrations reported for groundwater wells in plaquemine louisiana represent some of the highest as concentrations measured to date in louisiana groundwaters borrok et al 2018 johannesson et al 2019 yang et al 2014 2015a 2016 moreover these data show that the highest as concentration measured in groundwaters from the pleistocene mraa i e 8 5 µmol kg 1 is ca 64 fold higher than the current mcl for as in drinking waters set by the us epa and similar to as concentrations measured in groundwaters from the ganges delta in west bengal india e g datta et al 2011 mohajerin et al 2013 sankar et al 2014 and references therein high as concentrations i e up to 1 0 μmol kg 1 or 77 μg kg 1 were also reported for groundwaters from the mraa in southeastern arkansas sharif et al 2008 and in east baton rouge parish louisiana just to the north of our study site where an as concentration of 0 86 μmol kg 1 i e 64 3 μg l 1 is reported borrok et al 2018 however unlike the mraa beneath plaquemine la where the aquifer is confined beneath approximately 20 35 m of holocene silts and clays kesel 2008 welch and hanor 2011 whiteman 1972 the confining silts and clays are either absent or at most 12 m thick in southern arkansas sharif et al 2008 based on the interpolation and intersection maps figs 3 4 we suggest that the high arsenic concentrations in mraa groundwater beneath plaquemine la is consistent with the reductive dissolution of fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides followed by the release of sorbed and or co precipitated as into the groundwaters on average the majority of as in groundwaters from the sw wells is as v but mixed redox conditions are clearly present across the study area hence the redox conditions of the sw well groundwaters may not reflect the as redox speciation near the mississippi riverbank where as concentrations are highest and groundwater is likely more reducing this is because depending on ph as v is generally more strongly adsorbed onto fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides and other minerals in aquifer sediments than as iii chakraborty et al 2007 dixit and hering 2003 johannesson et al 2019 thus based on the spatial correlations between the as fe and mn maps we infer that mobilization of as occurs near the riverbank but the mobilized as is largely re adsorbed onto existing fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides and or re precipitated with neo formed fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides with flow down gradient away from the mississippi river see figs 1 3 4 specifically the highest spatial correlations i e the scorr value of 1 between as fe and mn concentrations occur proximal to the mississippi river whereas spatial correlations weaken with distance from the river see fig 4a c the fact that the highest as fe and mn concentrations occur right near the mississippi river riverbank suggests that the interaction of the river water with the aquifer or possibly the oxidized silty clay to sandy silt layer that occurs at the contact between the mraa sands and the overlying holocene confining layer may be responsible for fe iii and possibly mn iv reduction and subsequent as mobilization e g nicholas et al 2017 borrok et al 2018 wallis et al 2020 the mississippi river is sufficiently deep at the field site that it has cut through the confining layer and is in contact with mraa fig 1c welch and hanor 2011 whiteman 1972 although high groundwater as fe and mn concentrations are located near where bayou jacob and bayou plaquemine historically connected to the mississippi river the bayous are not likely contributing substantial recharge to the mraa because both have a maximum depth of around 8 m and thus do not cut through the ca 30 m thick confining layer on top of the mraa ralston 1912 walley 2013 nevertheless additional investigation of the hydrogeology and particularly the hydrologic properties of the confining clay beneath these bayous is necessary to confirm this assumption borrok et al 2018 also reported that the highest as concentrations in groundwaters from the mraa occurred in well waters collected near the mississippi river including the west bank of the river in east baton rouge parish and into eastern iberville parish see their fig 7 stable water isotope analyses i e δ18o δd of mraa groundwaters and waters from the mississippi river indicate that the high as groundwaters near the river are hydraulically connected to the river such that much of this groundwater is in fact recharged mississippi river water borrok et al 2018 for example high as groundwaters from the mraa near the river in iberville parish have a mean δ18o 37 8 and mean δd 6 08 relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow which compare favorably to the mean 1σ n 4 δ18o and δd values of mississippi river waters of 42 5 1 21 and 6 4 0 9 respectively borrok et al 2018 mississippi river water the high as iberville groundwaters and other mraa groundwaters from near the riverbank plot along or close to the national meteoric water line i e kendall and coplen 2001 the negative δ18o and δd values of the mississippi river waters and iberville parish mraa groundwaters reflect their origins as meteoric precipitation from further inland and north within the mississippi river watershed borrok et al 2018 by comparison the less negative δ18o and δd values of mraa groundwaters collected further away from the mississippi river appear to be mixtures of local meteoric precipitation and river water see fig 5 in borrok et al 2018 the geostatistical and geospatial relationships support although cannot prove our hypotheses that reductive dissolution of fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides is likely the chief mechanism by which as is mobilized into mraa groundwater at the plaquemine study site although the correlation coefficients between as fe and mn are not exceptionally high 0 7 they are spatially related and statistically significant pas fe 0 0005 pas mn 0 0005 and pas fe mn 0 0005 at the 95 confidence level see appendix a suppl table 3 the p values show there is a linear relationship between the as and fe or mn concentrations furthermore moderate to strong correlation coefficients between as and fe or mn in groundwater can be attributed to the different behavior of each element in solution once mobilized in non sulfidic waters and at neutral ph as iii occurs as the arsenite oxyanion h3asiiio3 0 whereas as v occurs as various ionized forms of the arsenate oxyanion e g h2asvo4 hasvo4 2 e g dixit and hering 2003 lu and zhu 2011 smedley 2008 the ionized nature of the arsenate oxyanion in circumneutral ph water explains in part its particle reactivity and strong surface complexation onto fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides e g dixit and hering 2003 goldberg 2002 johannesson et al 2019 manning and goldberg 1997 mohajerin et al 2013 2014 pierce and moore 1982 because the un ionized arsenite oxyanion is less particle reactive than the ionized arsenate oxyanion at the ph of the sw well groundwaters it is likely to be more readily transported with flowing groundwater than arsenate e g johannesson et al 2019 in contrast both fe and mn form divalent cations in anaerobic waters that are strongly adsorbed at circumneutral ph but likely occur as colloidal materials in oxygenated waters e g smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the concurrently mobilized fe ii may subsequently be removed from solution by re adsorption onto fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides remaining in the aquifer sediments or via precipitation of secondary fe ii bearing minerals like siderite vivianite and or as fe sulfide minerals e g mackinawite greigite and or pyrite when sulfate reduction is important burton et al 2007 horneman et al 2004 kocar et al 2010 mcarthur et al 2001 zachara et al 2002 geochemical modeling of the mraa beneath plaquemine louisiana using our geochemical analyses which includes arsenic and iron speciation data of the sw wells see suppl table 2 and the average major ion concentration data for the mraa from sharif et al 2008 and adebayo et al 2018 was undertaken using the spece8 program of the geochemist s workbench release 14 0 1 bethke et al 2020 our goal here is to evaluate likely mineral saturation states in the mraa beneath plaquemine louisiana to inform on possible controls on dissolved fe mn and as concentrations in the mraa groundwaters suppl tables 4 5 the lawrence livermore national laboratory thermochemical database delany and lundeen 1989 provided with the software i e thermo tdat was modified as described in yang et al 2015b based on the model the sw groundwaters are saturated with respect to siderite feco3 sisiderite 0 29 0 27 where si saturation index log q k the modeling also indicates that groundwaters from the sw wells are all substantially undersaturated with respect to all arsenic minerals included in the modeling including realgar sirealgar 4 78 0 86 scorodite siscorodite 6 99 0 69 and orpiment siorpiment 10 6 2 09 hence the moderate spatial correlations between fe and as in mraa groundwaters may reflect precipitation of secondary siderite and pyrite which is highly oversaturated in groundwaters from the sw wells sipyrite 5 08 1 08 both fe ii and fe iii may also be transported with flowing groundwater in the mraa as organic complexes because both ferric and ferrous iron form strong complexes with dissolved organic matter dupré et al 1999 tipping et al 2002 laglera and van den berg 2009 daugherty et al 2017 furthermore differences in the adsorption behavior of as iii and as v as well as fe ii and fe iii likely play a role in the moderate correlations between the total dissolved as and fe concentrations in mraa groundwaters beneath plaquemine louisiana see johannesson et al 2019 although the geochemical modeling indicates that the sw groundwaters are slightly undersaturated with respect to rhodochrosite mnco3 sirhodochrosite 0 45 0 18 the possibility that mn concentrations are limited by a mn phosphate phase cannot be ruled out suppl table 5 however to the best of our knowledge phosphate concentrations have not been determined in groundwaters from our study area and thus the use of the mean po4 3 concentrations determined by sharif et al 2008 for the mraa in southeastern arkansas for our modeling is at best inconclusive hence the saturation indexes computed for vivianite presented in appendix a suppl table 5 should be viewed with caution the proximity of the highest as fe and mn concentrations to the mississippi river suggests that the river likely plays a role in generating the high as concentrations of the studied groundwater system we suggest that labile organic matter from the river may enter the aquifer and fuel this reductive dissolution specifically the influx of dissolved organic carbon doc from the mississippi river or the river bottom muds into the sandy and oxidized mraa e g kesel 2008 could partially drive microbial respiration of fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides within the aquifer sediments mobilizing absorbed and or co precipitated as into the mraa groundwaters wallis et al 2020 we note that the δ13c values of dissolved inorganic carbon in groundwaters from the mraa are reported to range from 17 4 to 11 1 relative to vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb which indicates that hco3 in these groundwaters reflects both microbial respiration of organic matter as well as aquifer mineral weathering borrok et al 2018 hence the δ13c values provide evidence that microbial reduction of oxidants like fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides and so4 2 occurs within the mraa of louisiana these oxidants may already exist within the mraa sediments i e fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides kesel 2008 sharif et al 2008 or be carried in by recharging river waters as dissolved species e g no3 so4 2 or as colloidal fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides stolpe et al 2010 wallis et al 2020 alternatively these oxidants and the labile organic matter may be sourced at least in part in river bottoms muds where the river is hydraulically connected to the aquifer see wallis et al 2020 although we did not measure doc in the mississippi river others report that it typically ranges from ca 65 µmol kg 1 in the winter to ca 359 µmol kg 1 in the summer benner and opsahl 2001 the seasonal variations in total doc concentrations in the lower mississippi river reflect both autochthonous and allochthonous sources primarily derived from the upper mississippi river and its tributaries waterson and canuel 2008 other investigators report that autochthonous doc mostly algal derived and phytoplankton is more biologically available i e labile than allochthonous doc in the mississippi river bianchi et al 2004 chen and gardner 2004 in the lower mississippi river doc is chiefly derived from allochthonous sources during high water discharge via surface runoffs whereas more labile autochthonous doc comes from in situ algal production that is highest during low water discharge periods duan and bianchi 2007 hence these studies show that the mixed sources of doc in the lower mississippi river are due to the seasonal shifts in concentration of doc and sporadic inputs of terrestrial doc from tributaries and runoff from wetlands and forest soils across the mississippi river valley watershed duan and bianchi 2007 duan et al 2007a therefore as dagg et al 2005 argued the principal source of doc within the lower mississippi river at any given time can be unclear owing to seasonal variations in river flow dissolved load and photosynthesis extended residence times can also increase the in situ production of more labile algal sourced doc and also produce more labile forms of doc by photochemical decomposition of terrestrially derived doc cai et al 2015 duan et al 2007b nonetheless these studies indicate that an important portion of the doc carried by the mississippi river is labile which can be readily degraded by microbes consequently we submit that the introduction of labile forms of doc into the mraa by river recharge of the aquifer could fuel microbial oxidation of this labile organic carbon coupled to fe iii mn iv oxide oxyhydroxide reduction this process would subsequently release as associated with these metal oxides oxyhydroxides into the mraa groundwaters we note that sharif et al 2008 also argued that the reductive dissolution of fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides in the mraa was responsible for the as mobilization that produced the high groundwater as concentrations in southern arkansas the importance of reductive dissolution of fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides as the chief mechanism of as mobilization into mraa groundwaters is further supported by our previous investigations of high as groundwaters in southern louisiana for example using laboratory microcosms yang et al 2016 incubated shallow holocene sediments from napoleonville louisiana and showed that microbial respiratory processes were the likely cause of elevated as concentrations in the associated pore waters moreover johannesson et al 2019 employed a biogeochemical reactive transport model incorporating microbial respiratory kinetics and thermodynamics that was able to reproduce elevated as iii and as v concentrations in shallow groundwaters from the holocene upper chicot aquifer in southern louisiana hence the spatial relationships between groundwater as fe and mn concentrations within the mraa beneath plaquemine louisiana and the stable carbon and water isotope ratios from borrok et al 2018 we submit that recharge of the aquifer by mississippi river waters supplies labile doc that fuels microbial reduction of fe iii mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides within the oxidized aquifer sediments e g kesel 2008 that subsequently releases as that was sorbed onto and or co precipitated with these metal oxides oxyhydroxides confirmation of this mechanism will require additional study of the mraa groundwaters and the aquifer sediments beneath plaquemine louisiana nonetheless investigations by sharif et al 2008 and borrok et al 2018 in the mraa as well as a recent study of groundwater as mobilization along the red river in vietnam wallis et al 2020 all support the likelihood that river water recharge of local aquifers can import labile forms of organic matter and oxidants that fuel reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides and the subsequent release of sorbed and or co precipitated as to groundwaters the possibility of groundwater flow reversals e g whiteman 1972 discharging high as groundwaters into the mississippi river is countered by the relative rarity of such events owing to the highly controlled flows within the river to ensure navigability by ocean going vessels as well as the high probability of dilution of any high as groundwater that enters the river by the immense volumes of water transported by the river e g river discharge 530 109 m3 year 1 mckee et al 2004 this is further supported by the low as concentrations that have been measured in the mississippi river for example borrok et al 2018 were unable to detect as in the four mississippi river water samples they analyzed using icp optical emission spectroscopy reporting that as concentrations were always less than 0 133 μmol kg 1 10 μg l 1 likewise telfeyan et al 2018 reported that the as concentrations of six of the eight mississippi river water samples collected near new orleans were below the detection limit of 6 74 10 4 μmol kg 1 i e 0 05 μg l 1 using hr icp ms the two river samples with detectable arsenic had concentrations of 0 0022 μmol kg 1 i e 0 16 μg l 1 and 0 015 μmol kg 1 i e 1 1 μg l 1 telfeyan et al 2018 finally the geostatistical and geospatial results support the possibility that labile organic matter from the mississippi river fuels reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides oxyhydroxides within the pleistocene sands of the mraa releasing as into the groundwater system the fact that as concentrations decrease dramatically with distance away from the riverbank suggests that the mobilized as is subsequently re adsorbed onto fe mn oxides oxyhydroxides further downgradient along the flow path e g johannesson et al 2019 strong re adsorption of as is consistent with our speciation analysis of groundwaters from the sw wells which reveals that although mixed as v is generally the chief form of as in mraa groundwaters the decrease in fe concentrations away from the riverbank may also reflect re adsorption onto existing fe oxides oxyhydroxides e g horneman et al 2004 postma et al 2007 2010 tufano and fendorf 2008 wallis et al 2020 or precipitation of secondary minerals like siderite and or pyrite as mraa groundwater are saturated to oversaturated respectively with these fe ii bearing minerals see appendix a suppl table 5 6 conclusions arsenic concentrations in groundwater from the mississippi river alluvial aquifer mraa beneath plaquemine louisiana reach concentrations as high as 8 50 μmol kg 1 i e 637 μg kg 1 which is a ca 64 fold higher than the maximum contaminant level for as in drinking water recognized by the us epa and who the plaquemine site differs from the majority of locations investigated in southern louisiana in that the elevated groundwater as concentrations occur in the late pleistocene sands of the mraa which are characterized by abundant fe iii oxides oxyhydroxides e g aslan and autin 1999 kesel 2008 sharif et al 2008 2011 borrok et al 2018 because pleistocene aquifers of south and southeast asia are currently viewed as safe sources of drinking water the source of as contamination in the pleistocene sands of the mraa in plaquemine louisiana warrants investigation and may provide insights for the use of groundwater in similar pleistocene aquifers from around the world the results of geospatial and geostatistical analyses are consistent with the notion that recharge of the aquifer by mississippi river water introduces labile doc into the mraa that subsequently fuels microbial respiration and mobilizes reductive dissolution of sorbed and or co precipitated as into the groundwater reducing conditions are consistent with introducing labile forms of doc either autochthonous or allochthonous from the lower mississippi river that recharges the mraa the doc serves as the electron donor in the pleistocene sands of the mraa beneath plaquemine louisiana mobilized as may then be re adsorbed onto mraa sediments further down gradient along the predominant flow path if this conceptual model is correct then as fe iii and mn iv oxides oxyhydroxides are stripped from the mraa sediments over time by microbially driven reductive dissolution arsenic may migrate further down gradient to more rural areas to the southwest where homeowners rely on shallow private wells for their water supply whiteman 1972 though the exact source s and chemical conditions or reactions leading to the elevated as concentrations in the mraa as well as the as mobilization processes are still unclear our investigation demonstrates that similar pleistocene aquifer sands such as those of south and southeast asia may also be a source of geogenic as if the redox conditions change to lower more reducing conditions credit authorship contribution statement omolola a akintomide methodology formal

4774,the construction and operation of underground cavern and drainage system for pumped storage are threatened by groundwater seepage numerical simulation methods are commonly used for seepage analysis of cavern and drainage system however the method for determining the influence zone of the cavern and drainage system is unclear the model range is difficult to confirm and the accuracy of the analysis results is unwarranted in this study the engineering and geological characteristics of 56 operational pumped storages were summarised numerical simulation experiments were conducted based on steady seepage analysis of simplified pumped storage with cavern and drainage system the influences of the model range on the groundwater level and flow rate of the cavern and drainage system were investigated and a method for determining the influence zone was proposed for the cavern and drainage system the results indicated that unclear influence zone of the cavern and drainage system existed in numerous pumped storages moreover a small model range strongly overstated the results regarding the flow rate and groundwater level as the groundwater drawdown at the computation boundary was ignored increased influence factors including the right and left bank groundwater surface slope ratio maximum water head depth above the cavern and volume of the cavern delayed the stable tendencies of the changes of the flow rate and groundwater level with an increased model range with a receivable flow rate threshold the proposed method could be used to predict the influence zone for the cavern and drainage system and the optimal model range could be confirmed to improve the calculation accuracy of seepage analysis keywords influence zone numerical simulation model range seepage analysis cavern and drainage system 1 introduction pumped storage ps is necessary for renewable energy and emergency backup power the planning and construction of pss are important for energy structure adjustments and environmental protection bonalumi et al 2012 xu et al 2019 li et al 2014 the construction of pss is gradually increasing worldwide especially in china by the end of 2019 the installed capacity of pss had reached 158 gw china s installed capacity of pss accounts for 19 of the world s total ranking first worldwide by 2035 the installed capacity of pss in china is predicted to reach 120 gw the underground power station is the core of the ps it includes underground cavern and drainage system equipment and operation sites are placed in the cavern the drainage system which mainly includes drainage hole arrays is usually distributed around the cavern of the ps to drain the groundwater similar to other underground engineering problems the seepage problems caused by groundwater in pss are disastrous and difficult to forecast cao et al 2019 goh et al 2020 trautz and wang 2002 zhang and goh 2015 goh and zhang 2012 furthermore the ecological environmental pressure caused by reducing the groundwater level is inestimable javadi et al 2016 bodeux et al 2017 xu et al 2020 numerical simulation methods are commonly used in seepage analysis of ps cavern and drainage system with the aid of computers however the computation results for the flow rate and groundwater level frequently show significant differences from the actual results one of the main reasons is the improper simulation model range darcy s law is the basis of most numerical simulation methods chen et al 2010 dang et al 2020 himi et al 2018 zhang and goh 2012 according to darcy s law the flow rate of a computation section is determined by its area hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient the computation section area and hydraulic conductivity of the stratum are constant and can be confirmed from engineering characteristics and hydrogeologic data the hydraulic gradient is typically determined by the distance and water head difference between the computation section and computation boundaries the water head difference is affected by the measured water level of the computation boundaries and the distance is influenced by the location of computation boundaries the computation boundaries can be located in a study area possessing a specific watershed valley reservoir and river when the geological conditions above do not exist the model range and locations for computation boundaries are usually confirmed by experts earlier studies concerning the influences of the model range on seepage analysis results can be found in the field of well hydraulics bresciani et al 2014 2020 as shown in fig 1 a in the study of bresciani et al 2020 when a pumping latent water well is in operation with homogeneous stratum a groundwater depression cone is formed after the groundwater swarms into the well ordinarily the shape of the groundwater depression cone in the planform is circular moreover an influence radius clearly exists in the pumping latent water well johnson 1988 bresciani et al 2020 the phenomenon of the influence radius in the pumping latent water well can be described by the dupuit solution dupuit 1863 as follows 1 2 h 0 s w s w q w π k ln r w r w where h 0 is the depth of the aquifer s w is the groundwater drawdown in the pumping well q w is the pumping flow rate k is the aquifer hydraulic conductivity r w is the influence radius of the pumping well and r w is the radius of the pumping well when the seepage analysis simulation model is used for the pumping latent water well in fig 1 a the constant water head boundary should be located at or beyond the influence radius 1 constant water head boundary in fig 1 a so as to avoid the influence of the groundwater drawdown in the computation boundaries according to eq 1 the values of r w and s w are reduced when the constant water head boundary is moved from 1 to 2 and the other parameters remain constant thus the values of the groundwater drawdown and environmental stress caused by pumping latent water well are underestimated as shown in fig 1 b as the boundary conditions of the wells of the cavern and drainage system are generally potential seepage boundaries the groundwater depression cone still exists when we replace the pumping latent water well with the ps cavern and drainage system in contrast to the pumping latent water well in fig 1 a the ps study area usually possesses an upstream reservoir and a downstream reservoir or river these act as stable water sources for replenishing groundwater the shape of the groundwater depression zone caused by the cavern and drainage system is close to a rectangle when the topography of the right and left banks extends horizontally fig 1 b additionally the influence zone for the ps cavern and drainage system is formed which is similar to the situation of the influence radius thus for the computation boundaries of the ps cavern and drainage system simulation model the constant water head boundary in the right and left banks should be located at or beyond the influence zone of the cavern and drainage system 1 constant water head boundary in fig 1 b therefore for pumping latent water wells or ps cavern and drainage system the model range r can be confirmed as equal to the known influence zone thus it is necessary to confirm the value of r for seepage analysis of the ps cavern and drainage system however the determination method for the influence zone of the cavern and drainage system and influence mechanism of r on the seepage analysis results are not clear and related research is scarce based on the definition of the influence radius for the pumping latent water well the groundwater drawdown at the influence radius should be infinitesimal and approach zero hence the value of the influence radius was determined to be infinite for ease of application the drawdown threshold of the groundwater level was defined as shown in fig 1 a the influence radius of the pumping latent water well could be confirmed using the ratio between the drawdown threshold and groundwater drawdown at the well with a suggested ratio range of 0 001 0 1 johnson 1988 bresciani et al 2020 in this study numerical simulation experiments were conducted to establish a relationship between the cavern and drainage system flow rate q and r and to examine three influence factors a flow rate threshold q t was proposed by referring to the groundwater drawdown threshold influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system could be confirmed with receivable q t and the relationship between q and r then the optimal value of r which is equal to the influence zone can be ensured the paper was organized as follows in section 2 1 it is demonstrated that that unclear influence zone or influence zone with large values exist in numerous pss based on a statistical analysis of 56 operational pss in section 2 2 the influences of different r on q values and groundwater levels were analysed and a basic equation was established between q and r in section 2 3 three major influence factors were confirmed after comparing the ps cavern and drainage system with a pumping latent water well based on the dupuit solution the value distribution of the influence factors was summarised in section 2 4 the numerical simulation experiments were introduced and the influence factors were changed for factor analysis in sections 3 1 and 3 2 single factor and multivariate regression analysis were conducted on the regression coefficients of the basic equation for q and r and influence factors in section 4 1 we proposed a determination method for the influence zone of ps cavern and drainage system in section 4 2 the accuracy of the proposed method was verified in section 4 3 limitations and valuable further works were introduced 2 methodology 2 1 statistics of pumped storage characteristics table 1 presents the statistical results for engineering and geological characteristics of 56 operational pss including the topography slope ratio i t of the right and left banks maximum hydroelectric head h ymax and size of the cavern in table 1 l p is the planform distance from the cavern and drainage system to the ridge or valley as shown in table 1 the right and left bank topographies of most pss are uneven the topography extension form is illustrated in fig 2 and can be divided into four types 1 rise to the ridge with 26 7 topography of the right bank and 26 7 topography of the left bank 2 decline to the valley with 53 6 topography of the right bank and 62 5 topography of the left bank 3 decline to the flat with 7 1 topography of the right bank and 5 4 topography of the left bank 4 extend gently with 12 5 topography of the right bank and 5 4 topography of the left bank as the watershed usually exits in the ridge the computation boundary should be located at the watershed as a confining boundary green dashed lines in fig 2 a the groundwater level in the valley of fig 2 b was typically a constant result owing to the steady water supply from high groundwater hence a constant water head boundary red dashed lines in fig 2 b could be installed the influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system was specific in fig 2 a and b but the influence zone in fig 2 b was large as the valley was far away from the cavern and drainage system in some cases the distance approached 6 72 km in fig 2 c and d the influence zone was unclear thus when the right and left bank topographies of the ps declined to the valley which was far from the cavern and drainage system or declined to the flat or extended gently the values of the influence zone and r were difficult to confirm 2 2 relationship between model range and seepage analysis results to further analyse the influences of r on the seepage analysis results a numerical simulation model for a simplified ps with cavern and drainage system was established using abaqus dassault systèmes 2017 the cavern had a width height length and buried depth of 25 40 50 27 157 01 and 1200 m respectively fig 3 the drainage hole arrays around the cavern had a diameter space and distance from the cavern of 5 cm 5 m and 20 m respectively and the top drainage hole arrays were obliquely distributed upward by 30 the drainage holes in the simulation model were simplified to line elements xu et al 2020 the groundwater level was assumed to be 50 m below the earth s surface the hydraulic conductivity of the homogeneous stratum was set as 10 7 m s the walls of the cavern and drainage hole were potential seepage boundaries and the boundary conditions of the upstream downstream and right and left banks were constant water head boundary the influence zone of the cavern and drainage system was constant in upstream and downstream owing to the upper and lower reservoirs hence we symmetrically extended r in both the right and left banks by 200 m each time all simulation models in this study abided by this principle to investigate the changes in q and the groundwater level thus a group of numerical simulation experiments 11 numerical simulation experiments in a group was conducted with steady seepage analysis the results of the groundwater level and q with different r values are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively r strongly influenced the results of the groundwater level and q the value of groundwater level and q was substantially overstated with small values of r the groundwater level significantly decreased with a small r but only slightly decreased with a large r fig 4 as did the changes in hydrostatic pressure above the cavern and drainage system q decreased from 87 56 l s to 61 89 l s when r increased from 1 4 km to 5 4 km fig 5 the nonlinear decrease of the groundwater level and q with increased r demonstrated an evolution law similar to the change in q w and s w with various r w according to eq 1 the relationship between q and r after the regression analysis could be expressed as follows 2 q a r b where a and b are regression coefficients 2 3 influence factors according to the analysis of the difference between the pumping latent water well and ps cavern and drainage system based on the dupuit solution the influence factors affecting the influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system were summarised as follows 1 the ps study area was generally very large with varied topography and the groundwater surface in most situations was not horizontal which deviated from the assumption for the dupuit solution huang et al 2014 hence the groundwater surface slope ratio i g should be considered 2 the boundary conditions of the cavern and drainage system were potential seepage boundaries and not flow rate boundaries thus the influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system was theoretically unaffected by the hydraulic conductivity of the homogeneous stratum 3 the potential seepage boundary of the cavern and drainage system did not intersect the groundwater surface or aquifer and the water head depth above the cavern had a similar effect on h 0 in eq 1 to a certain extent therefore the maximum water head depth above the cavern h max must be considered 4 according to eq 1 r w was affected by r w when other parameters were constant hence the size of the ps cavern was another influence factor that must be considered in this study similar to the simplified simulation model in fig 3 we assumed that the groundwater level was 50 m below the earth s surface thus the slope ratio of the groundwater surface and topography were equal and h max was equal to the maximum buried depth of cavern minus 50 m based on table 1 fig 6 shows the weight distribution of i t h ymax and the size of the cavern with different value ranges as indicated in fig 6 a the downhill i t in the right bank changed from 0 040 to 0 526 and that in the left bank changed from 0 035 to 0 719 the uphill i t in the right bank changed from 0 633 to 0 143 and that in the left bank changed from 0 810 to 0 273 the downhill i t in the right bank was mostly distributed in 0 0 2 38 9 and 0 2 0 4 36 1 and that in the left bank was predominantly distributed in 0 2 0 4 38 9 according to fig 6 b the h ymax of pss in table 1 significantly changed from 210 m to 1164 m in addition most pss were operational with a low hydraulic head in which 40 4 of the ps hydraulic heads were in the range of 400 600 m while 40 4 were lower than 400 m fig 6 c shows that the size of the ps cavern was considerably different it also shows that the width changed from 12 m to 34 m the height changed from 24 m to 67 m length changed from 64 m to 330 m and v changed from 23 040 to 378 000 m3 the width values were mainly distributed in 20 25 51 0 and 25 30 29 4 m and 49 0 and 31 4 of the height values were in the range of 40 50 and 50 60 m respectively moreover 72 5 of the length values were in the range of 90 160 m and 33 3 of the v values were in the range of 105 1 5 105 and 1 5 105 2 105 m3 respectively 2 4 simulation models based on table 1 and the assumptions of this study the value ranges of i g h max and v are shown in fig 7 corresponding numerical simulation experiments were conducted by changing the model in fig 3 to examine the influences of i g h max and v on the relationship between q and r we divided i g h max and v into five values table 2 the width height and length values in table 2 were confirmed by the average value ratio of the width height and length of the cavern in table 1 at a scale of 1 1 979 6 181 based on simulation models in fig 3 and table 2 five groups of numerical simulation experiments were conducted based on changing the i g values of the right and left banks simultaneously fig 8 a in addition five groups of numerical simulation experiments were conducted by changing h max fig 8 b another five groups of numerical simulation experiments were conducted by changing v fig 8 c 3 results 3 1 single factor analysis fig 9 shows the relationship between q and r with the influence of i g h max and v the relationship between q and r still followed eq 2 when i g h max and v varied within the ranges of the statistical results as shown in fig 9 a and b q decreased with increased i g and decreased h max when r was constant because of the reductions in the hydrostatic pressure and hydraulic gradient fig 9 c illustrates that the area of the potential seepage boundary increased immediately with increasing v hence additional groundwater flowed into the cavern and drainage system with a corresponding increase in q the impact of v on q was consistent with eq 1 as q w increased with increased r w when other parameters were set to a certain value furthermore fig 9 explicitly shows that i g h max and v had strong influences on the slope of the regression that is with a small r and increased i g h max and v values overestimated the absolute value of the slope and delayed the stable tendency of the evolution of q and the groundwater level thus i g h max and v strongly affect the influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system fig 10 illustrates the influence mechanism of i g h max and v on the regression coefficients a and b of eq 2 as shown in fig 10 the value of a increased non linearly with the increases in i g h max and v the increased i g and v values led to decreased b when b increased with the increase in h max the nonlinear effects of i g h max and v on a and b could be summarised as follows 3 a e α 1 i g a h max α 2 a v α 3 4 b e β 1 i g b h max β 2 b v β 3 where αi and βi i 1 2 3 are regression coefficients 3 2 multivariate regression analysis fifteen groups of numerical simulation experiments were conducted to further scrutinise the comprehensive influences of i g h max and v on the regression coefficients a and b of eq 2 fig 11 displays the results of q and r when fitted using eq 2 table 3 shows the relationships between i h max and v and the regression coefficients a and b in addition a multivariate regression analysis was performed using the results in table 3 the results show that regression coefficients a and b changed nonlinearly with various i g h max and v values the typical multiplicative form was used to establish the nonlinear empirical relationships and functional forms among a and b and i g h max and v were expressed as follows peng and zhang 2011 wen et al 2017 5 a α 1 e α 2 i g h max α 3 v α 4 6 b β 1 e β 2 i g h max β 3 v β 4 where αi and βi i 1 2 3 4 are regression coefficients eqs 5 and 6 could be transformed into the linear functions by taking the natural logarithm on both sides before conducting the multiplicative regression analysis as follows 7 ln a ln α 1 α 2 i g α 3 ln h max α 4 ln v 8 ln b ln β 1 β 2 i g β 3 ln h max β 4 ln v eqs 7 and 8 could be expressed after the multivariate regression analysis as follows 9 a 0 028 e 0 366 i h max 0 995 v 0 095 r 2 0 9290 10 b 8 356 e 2 237 i h max 0 595 v 0 056 r 2 0 8610 4 discussion 4 1 determination of the influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system an infinite r was required in the ps cavern and drainage system in this study when the reduction of q tended to be infinitesimal or zero according to the relationship between q and r with the nonlinear influences of i g h max and v we established arbitrary ri i 1 2 3 n values which led to corresponding qi i 1 2 3 n values referring to the determination of the influence radius the flow rate threshold q t could be expressed as follows 11 δ q t q n q n 1 a r n b a r n 1 b where a and b can be confirmed using eqs 9 and 10 from another perspective q t can be treated as the receivable calculation error of q for different ps engineering the value of q t or the calculation error is influenced by the corresponding characteristics and requirements of such techniques if q t is confirmed in the specific ps cavern and drainage system then the value of r representing the influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system can be calculated using the following steps 1 calculate the regression coefficients a and b according to eqs 9 and 10 respectively with specific values of i g h max and v the value range of i g h max and v in eqs 9 and 10 should be 0 0 553 150 1 150 m and 23 000 378 000 m3 respectively 2 substitute the calculated a and b values and accredited q t into eq 11 in which r n 1 r n 0 4 km then the influence zone of the cavern and drainage system can be inversely computed and is equal to the optimal r 4 2 verification of the influence zone determination method a group of simulation models for a simplified ps with cavern and drainage system fig 12 was used to verify the determination method of influence zone and a contrastive analysis was conducted between the results of the numerical simulation and those from the proposed methods the values of i g h max and v which accounted for a large proportion of the statistical results were confirmed in fig 6 at i g 0 2 h max 450 m and v 126 562 m3 the width height and length were 22 5 45 and 125 m respectively the regression coefficients a and b could be confirmed with the values of i g h max and v using eqs 9 and 10 with a 40 1434 and b 0 6658 the relationship between q and r in the simplified ps could be subsequently calculated using eq 2 accordingly fig 13 shows the relationship between q and r as computed with the simulation models and eqs 2 9 and 10 in fig 13 the results of q as confirmed by numerical simulation and those from the proposed methods were close such that the maximum absolute value of the difference between them was only 0 39 l s additionally the values of regression coefficients a and b as computed with the simulation models were 40 7141 and 0 6764 respectively which were close to the results when eqs 9 and 10 was applied furthermore assuming that q t 1 l s according to the numerical simulation results the decrement of q was 1 02 l s when r increased from 3 8 km to 4 2 km and 0 99 l s when r increased from 4 2 km to 4 6 km hence the value of the influence zone was in the range of 4 2 4 6 km by substituting the calculated a and b values in eq 11 the value of the influence radius was determined as approximately 4 352 km a precise value within the range of the numerical simulation results thus the method proposed in this study could effectively confirm the influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system with credible accuracy 4 3 analysis of limitations and valuable further works despite the meticulous care that we considered the following limitations were unavoidable and further works are suggested to address them 1 owing to the lack of field measured data we assumed the groundwater level to be 50 m below the earth s surface and to be parallel to the topography thus i g i t and h max was equal to the maximum buried depth of the cavern minus 50 m for a specific ps i g and h max should be confirmed based on explicit groundwater data in addition we neglected the undulation of the topography when we extended r so in the dupuit solution the seepage medium was considered as homogeneous in this study and the influences of flow regime fault zone and fracture group on the influence zone were not considered thus additional studies are encouraged to investigate more influence factors 2 we symmetrically extended r in the right and left banks table 1 shows that the right and left banks of most pss were asymmetrical we suggest mirroring the right and left banks to another side and then confirming the optimal right and left banks r with the accredited q t for these cases furthermore the application of the correct units for the parameters should be emphasised in this study owing to the conflicting dimensions of the regression equations the units of l s km m and m3 should be used for q r h max and v respectively 3 fig 5 indicates that when the constant water head boundary was close to the cavern and drainage system the groundwater drawdown caused by the cavern and drainage system was neglected and that the results for q and the groundwater level were overestimated with the increased r the influence of groundwater drawdown on the computation boundary gradually became feeble and the reductions of q and the groundwater level tended to zero thus from another perspective we can counteract the influence by directly reducing the groundwater level of the constant water head boundary however the mechanisms of the groundwater level of the computation boundary influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system are unclear hence additional related studies are suggested 5 conclusion in the present study the statistical results regarding the engineering and geological characteristics of 56 operational pss were summarised and changes in the seepage analysis results with varied values of r were investigated then the relationship between q and r with three influence factors was established based on numerical simulation experiments ultimately the determination method of influence zone for ps cavern and drainage system was proposed based on the regression analysis results and receivable q t the following conclusions were drawn 1 the value of r was hard to confirm with the blurry influence zone of the cavern and drainage system these commonly exist in pss the seepage analysis accuracy of the ps underground station and the prediction of ecological environmental pressure caused by the drawing groundwater level were suspicious with inappropriate values of r 2 the results for q and the groundwater level were substantially overstated with small r values and the reduction of q and the groundwater level tended to be infinitesimal when r infinitely increased the influence factors i h max and v had non linear effects on the values of coefficients a and b furthermore increased i h max and v delayed the stable tendency of the evolution of q and groundwater level within the statistical value range 3 the optimal value of r could be the same as the value of the influence zone calculated by the proposed method the influence of the groundwater drawdown in the constant water head boundary condition could be counteracted and the seepage analysis error caused by inappropriate r values could be eliminated additionally the range of the groundwater depression cone could be directly predicted using the proposed method credit

cavern and drainage system 1 introduction pumped storage ps is necessary for renewable energy and emergency backup power the planning and construction of pss are important for energy structure adjustments and environmental protection bonalumi et al 2012 xu et al 2019 li et al 2014 the construction of pss is gradually increasing worldwide especially in china by the end of 2019 the installed capacity of pss had reached 158 gw china s installed capacity of pss accounts for 19 of the world s total ranking first worldwide by 2035 the installed capacity of pss in china is predicted to reach 120 gw the underground power station is the core of the ps it includes underground cavern and drainage system equipment and operation sites are placed in the cavern the drainage system which mainly includes drainage hole arrays is usually distributed around the cavern of the ps to drain the groundwater similar to other underground engineering problems the seepage problems caused by groundwater in pss are disastrous and difficult to forecast cao et al 2019 goh et al 2020 trautz and wang 2002 zhang and goh 2015 goh and zhang 2012 furthermore the ecological environmental pressure caused by reducing the groundwater level is inestimable javadi et al 2016 bodeux et al 2017 xu et al 2020 numerical simulation methods are commonly used in seepage analysis of ps cavern and drainage system with the aid of computers however the computation results for the flow rate and groundwater level frequently show significant differences from the actual results one of the main reasons is the improper simulation model range darcy s law is the basis of most numerical simulation methods chen et al 2010 dang et al 2020 himi et al 2018 zhang and goh 2012 according to darcy s law the flow rate of a computation section is determined by its area hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient the computation section area and hydraulic conductivity of the stratum are constant and can be confirmed from engineering characteristics and hydrogeologic data the hydraulic gradient is typically determined by the distance and water head difference between the computation section and computation boundaries the water head difference is affected by the measured water level of the computation boundaries and the distance is influenced by the location of computation boundaries the computation boundaries can be located in a study area possessing a specific watershed valley reservoir and river when the geological conditions above do not exist the model range and locations for computation boundaries are usually confirmed by experts earlier studies concerning the influences of the model range on seepage analysis results can be found in the field of well hydraulics bresciani et al 2014 2020 as shown in fig 1 a in the study of bresciani et al 2020 when a pumping latent water well is in operation with homogeneous stratum a groundwater depression cone is formed after the groundwater swarms into the well ordinarily the shape of the groundwater depression cone in the planform is circular moreover an influence radius clearly exists in the pumping latent water well johnson 1988 bresciani et al 2020 the phenomenon of the influence radius in the pumping latent water well can be described by the dupuit solution dupuit 1863 as follows 1 2 h 0 s w s w q w π k ln r w r w where h 0 is the depth of the aquifer s w is the groundwater drawdown in the pumping well q w is the pumping flow rate k is the aquifer hydraulic conductivity r w is the influence radius of the pumping well and r w is the radius of the pumping well when the seepage analysis simulation model is used for the pumping latent water well in fig 1 a the constant water head boundary should be located at or beyond the influence radius 1 constant water head boundary in fig 1 a so as to avoid the influence of the groundwater drawdown in the computation boundaries according to eq 1 the values of r w and s w are reduced when the constant water head boundary is moved from 1 to 2 and the other parameters remain constant thus the values of the groundwater drawdown and environmental stress caused by pumping latent water well are underestimated as shown in fig 1 b as the boundary conditions of the wells of the cavern and drainage system are generally potential seepage boundaries the groundwater depression cone still exists when we replace the pumping latent water well with the ps cavern and drainage system in contrast to the pumping latent water well in fig 1 a the ps study area usually possesses an upstream reservoir and a downstream reservoir or river these act as stable water sources for replenishing groundwater the shape of the groundwater depression zone caused by the cavern and drainage system is close to a rectangle when the topography of the right and left banks extends horizontally fig 1 b additionally the influence zone for the ps cavern and drainage system is formed which is similar to the situation of the influence radius thus for the computation boundaries of the ps cavern and drainage system simulation model the constant water head boundary in the right and left banks should be located at or beyond the influence zone of the cavern and drainage system 1 constant water head boundary in fig 1 b therefore for pumping latent water wells or ps cavern and drainage system the model range r can be confirmed as equal to the known influence zone thus it is necessary to confirm the value of r for seepage analysis of the ps cavern and drainage system however the determination method for the influence zone of the cavern and drainage system and influence mechanism of r on the seepage analysis results are not clear and related research is scarce based on the definition of the influence radius for the pumping latent water well the groundwater drawdown at the influence radius should be infinitesimal and approach zero hence the value of the influence radius was determined to be infinite for ease of application the drawdown threshold of the groundwater level was defined as shown in fig 1 a the influence radius of the pumping latent water well could be confirmed using the ratio between the drawdown threshold and groundwater drawdown at the well with a suggested ratio range of 0 001 0 1 johnson 1988 bresciani et al 2020 in this study numerical simulation experiments were conducted to establish a relationship between the cavern and drainage system flow rate q and r and to examine three influence factors a flow rate threshold q t was proposed by referring to the groundwater drawdown threshold influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system could be confirmed with receivable q t and the relationship between q and r then the optimal value of r which is equal to the influence zone can be ensured the paper was organized as follows in section 2 1 it is demonstrated that that unclear influence zone or influence zone with large values exist in numerous pss based on a statistical analysis of 56 operational pss in section 2 2 the influences of different r on q values and groundwater levels were analysed and a basic equation was established between q and r in section 2 3 three major influence factors were confirmed after comparing the ps cavern and drainage system with a pumping latent water well based on the dupuit solution the value distribution of the influence factors was summarised in section 2 4 the numerical simulation experiments were introduced and the influence factors were changed for factor analysis in sections 3 1 and 3 2 single factor and multivariate regression analysis were conducted on the regression coefficients of the basic equation for q and r and influence factors in section 4 1 we proposed a determination method for the influence zone of ps cavern and drainage system in section 4 2 the accuracy of the proposed method was verified in section 4 3 limitations and valuable further works were introduced 2 methodology 2 1 statistics of pumped storage characteristics table 1 presents the statistical results for engineering and geological characteristics of 56 operational pss including the topography slope ratio i t of the right and left banks maximum hydroelectric head h ymax and size of the cavern in table 1 l p is the planform distance from the cavern and drainage system to the ridge or valley as shown in table 1 the right and left bank topographies of most pss are uneven the topography extension form is illustrated in fig 2 and can be divided into four types 1 rise to the ridge with 26 7 topography of the right bank and 26 7 topography of the left bank 2 decline to the valley with 53 6 topography of the right bank and 62 5 topography of the left bank 3 decline to the flat with 7 1 topography of the right bank and 5 4 topography of the left bank 4 extend gently with 12 5 topography of the right bank and 5 4 topography of the left bank as the watershed usually exits in the ridge the computation boundary should be located at the watershed as a confining boundary green dashed lines in fig 2 a the groundwater level in the valley of fig 2 b was typically a constant result owing to the steady water supply from high groundwater hence a constant water head boundary red dashed lines in fig 2 b could be installed the influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system was specific in fig 2 a and b but the influence zone in fig 2 b was large as the valley was far away from the cavern and drainage system in some cases the distance approached 6 72 km in fig 2 c and d the influence zone was unclear thus when the right and left bank topographies of the ps declined to the valley which was far from the cavern and drainage system or declined to the flat or extended gently the values of the influence zone and r were difficult to confirm 2 2 relationship between model range and seepage analysis results to further analyse the influences of r on the seepage analysis results a numerical simulation model for a simplified ps with cavern and drainage system was established using abaqus dassault systèmes 2017 the cavern had a width height length and buried depth of 25 40 50 27 157 01 and 1200 m respectively fig 3 the drainage hole arrays around the cavern had a diameter space and distance from the cavern of 5 cm 5 m and 20 m respectively and the top drainage hole arrays were obliquely distributed upward by 30 the drainage holes in the simulation model were simplified to line elements xu et al 2020 the groundwater level was assumed to be 50 m below the earth s surface the hydraulic conductivity of the homogeneous stratum was set as 10 7 m s the walls of the cavern and drainage hole were potential seepage boundaries and the boundary conditions of the upstream downstream and right and left banks were constant water head boundary the influence zone of the cavern and drainage system was constant in upstream and downstream owing to the upper and lower reservoirs hence we symmetrically extended r in both the right and left banks by 200 m each time all simulation models in this study abided by this principle to investigate the changes in q and the groundwater level thus a group of numerical simulation experiments 11 numerical simulation experiments in a group was conducted with steady seepage analysis the results of the groundwater level and q with different r values are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively r strongly influenced the results of the groundwater level and q the value of groundwater level and q was substantially overstated with small values of r the groundwater level significantly decreased with a small r but only slightly decreased with a large r fig 4 as did the changes in hydrostatic pressure above the cavern and drainage system q decreased from 87 56 l s to 61 89 l s when r increased from 1 4 km to 5 4 km fig 5 the nonlinear decrease of the groundwater level and q with increased r demonstrated an evolution law similar to the change in q w and s w with various r w according to eq 1 the relationship between q and r after the regression analysis could be expressed as follows 2 q a r b where a and b are regression coefficients 2 3 influence factors according to the analysis of the difference between the pumping latent water well and ps cavern and drainage system based on the dupuit solution the influence factors affecting the influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system were summarised as follows 1 the ps study area was generally very large with varied topography and the groundwater surface in most situations was not horizontal which deviated from the assumption for the dupuit solution huang et al 2014 hence the groundwater surface slope ratio i g should be considered 2 the boundary conditions of the cavern and drainage system were potential seepage boundaries and not flow rate boundaries thus the influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system was theoretically unaffected by the hydraulic conductivity of the homogeneous stratum 3 the potential seepage boundary of the cavern and drainage system did not intersect the groundwater surface or aquifer and the water head depth above the cavern had a similar effect on h 0 in eq 1 to a certain extent therefore the maximum water head depth above the cavern h max must be considered 4 according to eq 1 r w was affected by r w when other parameters were constant hence the size of the ps cavern was another influence factor that must be considered in this study similar to the simplified simulation model in fig 3 we assumed that the groundwater level was 50 m below the earth s surface thus the slope ratio of the groundwater surface and topography were equal and h max was equal to the maximum buried depth of cavern minus 50 m based on table 1 fig 6 shows the weight distribution of i t h ymax and the size of the cavern with different value ranges as indicated in fig 6 a the downhill i t in the right bank changed from 0 040 to 0 526 and that in the left bank changed from 0 035 to 0 719 the uphill i t in the right bank changed from 0 633 to 0 143 and that in the left bank changed from 0 810 to 0 273 the downhill i t in the right bank was mostly distributed in 0 0 2 38 9 and 0 2 0 4 36 1 and that in the left bank was predominantly distributed in 0 2 0 4 38 9 according to fig 6 b the h ymax of pss in table 1 significantly changed from 210 m to 1164 m in addition most pss were operational with a low hydraulic head in which 40 4 of the ps hydraulic heads were in the range of 400 600 m while 40 4 were lower than 400 m fig 6 c shows that the size of the ps cavern was considerably different it also shows that the width changed from 12 m to 34 m the height changed from 24 m to 67 m length changed from 64 m to 330 m and v changed from 23 040 to 378 000 m3 the width values were mainly distributed in 20 25 51 0 and 25 30 29 4 m and 49 0 and 31 4 of the height values were in the range of 40 50 and 50 60 m respectively moreover 72 5 of the length values were in the range of 90 160 m and 33 3 of the v values were in the range of 105 1 5 105 and 1 5 105 2 105 m3 respectively 2 4 simulation models based on table 1 and the assumptions of this study the value ranges of i g h max and v are shown in fig 7 corresponding numerical simulation experiments were conducted by changing the model in fig 3 to examine the influences of i g h max and v on the relationship between q and r we divided i g h max and v into five values table 2 the width height and length values in table 2 were confirmed by the average value ratio of the width height and length of the cavern in table 1 at a scale of 1 1 979 6 181 based on simulation models in fig 3 and table 2 five groups of numerical simulation experiments were conducted based on changing the i g values of the right and left banks simultaneously fig 8 a in addition five groups of numerical simulation experiments were conducted by changing h max fig 8 b another five groups of numerical simulation experiments were conducted by changing v fig 8 c 3 results 3 1 single factor analysis fig 9 shows the relationship between q and r with the influence of i g h max and v the relationship between q and r still followed eq 2 when i g h max and v varied within the ranges of the statistical results as shown in fig 9 a and b q decreased with increased i g and decreased h max when r was constant because of the reductions in the hydrostatic pressure and hydraulic gradient fig 9 c illustrates that the area of the potential seepage boundary increased immediately with increasing v hence additional groundwater flowed into the cavern and drainage system with a corresponding increase in q the impact of v on q was consistent with eq 1 as q w increased with increased r w when other parameters were set to a certain value furthermore fig 9 explicitly shows that i g h max and v had strong influences on the slope of the regression that is with a small r and increased i g h max and v values overestimated the absolute value of the slope and delayed the stable tendency of the evolution of q and the groundwater level thus i g h max and v strongly affect the influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system fig 10 illustrates the influence mechanism of i g h max and v on the regression coefficients a and b of eq 2 as shown in fig 10 the value of a increased non linearly with the increases in i g h max and v the increased i g and v values led to decreased b when b increased with the increase in h max the nonlinear effects of i g h max and v on a and b could be summarised as follows 3 a e α 1 i g a h max α 2 a v α 3 4 b e β 1 i g b h max β 2 b v β 3 where αi and βi i 1 2 3 are regression coefficients 3 2 multivariate regression analysis fifteen groups of numerical simulation experiments were conducted to further scrutinise the comprehensive influences of i g h max and v on the regression coefficients a and b of eq 2 fig 11 displays the results of q and r when fitted using eq 2 table 3 shows the relationships between i h max and v and the regression coefficients a and b in addition a multivariate regression analysis was performed using the results in table 3 the results show that regression coefficients a and b changed nonlinearly with various i g h max and v values the typical multiplicative form was used to establish the nonlinear empirical relationships and functional forms among a and b and i g h max and v were expressed as follows peng and zhang 2011 wen et al 2017 5 a α 1 e α 2 i g h max α 3 v α 4 6 b β 1 e β 2 i g h max β 3 v β 4 where αi and βi i 1 2 3 4 are regression coefficients eqs 5 and 6 could be transformed into the linear functions by taking the natural logarithm on both sides before conducting the multiplicative regression analysis as follows 7 ln a ln α 1 α 2 i g α 3 ln h max α 4 ln v 8 ln b ln β 1 β 2 i g β 3 ln h max β 4 ln v eqs 7 and 8 could be expressed after the multivariate regression analysis as follows 9 a 0 028 e 0 366 i h max 0 995 v 0 095 r 2 0 9290 10 b 8 356 e 2 237 i h max 0 595 v 0 056 r 2 0 8610 4 discussion 4 1 determination of the influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system an infinite r was required in the ps cavern and drainage system in this study when the reduction of q tended to be infinitesimal or zero according to the relationship between q and r with the nonlinear influences of i g h max and v we established arbitrary ri i 1 2 3 n values which led to corresponding qi i 1 2 3 n values referring to the determination of the influence radius the flow rate threshold q t could be expressed as follows 11 δ q t q n q n 1 a r n b a r n 1 b where a and b can be confirmed using eqs 9 and 10 from another perspective q t can be treated as the receivable calculation error of q for different ps engineering the value of q t or the calculation error is influenced by the corresponding characteristics and requirements of such techniques if q t is confirmed in the specific ps cavern and drainage system then the value of r representing the influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system can be calculated using the following steps 1 calculate the regression coefficients a and b according to eqs 9 and 10 respectively with specific values of i g h max and v the value range of i g h max and v in eqs 9 and 10 should be 0 0 553 150 1 150 m and 23 000 378 000 m3 respectively 2 substitute the calculated a and b values and accredited q t into eq 11 in which r n 1 r n 0 4 km then the influence zone of the cavern and drainage system can be inversely computed and is equal to the optimal r 4 2 verification of the influence zone determination method a group of simulation models for a simplified ps with cavern and drainage system fig 12 was used to verify the determination method of influence zone and a contrastive analysis was conducted between the results of the numerical simulation and those from the proposed methods the values of i g h max and v which accounted for a large proportion of the statistical results were confirmed in fig 6 at i g 0 2 h max 450 m and v 126 562 m3 the width height and length were 22 5 45 and 125 m respectively the regression coefficients a and b could be confirmed with the values of i g h max and v using eqs 9 and 10 with a 40 1434 and b 0 6658 the relationship between q and r in the simplified ps could be subsequently calculated using eq 2 accordingly fig 13 shows the relationship between q and r as computed with the simulation models and eqs 2 9 and 10 in fig 13 the results of q as confirmed by numerical simulation and those from the proposed methods were close such that the maximum absolute value of the difference between them was only 0 39 l s additionally the values of regression coefficients a and b as computed with the simulation models were 40 7141 and 0 6764 respectively which were close to the results when eqs 9 and 10 was applied furthermore assuming that q t 1 l s according to the numerical simulation results the decrement of q was 1 02 l s when r increased from 3 8 km to 4 2 km and 0 99 l s when r increased from 4 2 km to 4 6 km hence the value of the influence zone was in the range of 4 2 4 6 km by substituting the calculated a and b values in eq 11 the value of the influence radius was determined as approximately 4 352 km a precise value within the range of the numerical simulation results thus the method proposed in this study could effectively confirm the influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system with credible accuracy 4 3 analysis of limitations and valuable further works despite the meticulous care that we considered the following limitations were unavoidable and further works are suggested to address them 1 owing to the lack of field measured data we assumed the groundwater level to be 50 m below the earth s surface and to be parallel to the topography thus i g i t and h max was equal to the maximum buried depth of the cavern minus 50 m for a specific ps i g and h max should be confirmed based on explicit groundwater data in addition we neglected the undulation of the topography when we extended r so in the dupuit solution the seepage medium was considered as homogeneous in this study and the influences of flow regime fault zone and fracture group on the influence zone were not considered thus additional studies are encouraged to investigate more influence factors 2 we symmetrically extended r in the right and left banks table 1 shows that the right and left banks of most pss were asymmetrical we suggest mirroring the right and left banks to another side and then confirming the optimal right and left banks r with the accredited q t for these cases furthermore the application of the correct units for the parameters should be emphasised in this study owing to the conflicting dimensions of the regression equations the units of l s km m and m3 should be used for q r h max and v respectively 3 fig 5 indicates that when the constant water head boundary was close to the cavern and drainage system the groundwater drawdown caused by the cavern and drainage system was neglected and that the results for q and the groundwater level were overestimated with the increased r the influence of groundwater drawdown on the computation boundary gradually became feeble and the reductions of q and the groundwater level tended to zero thus from another perspective we can counteract the influence by directly reducing the groundwater level of the constant water head boundary however the mechanisms of the groundwater level of the computation boundary influence zone of the ps cavern and drainage system are unclear hence additional related studies are suggested 5 conclusion in the present study the statistical results regarding the engineering and geological characteristics of 56 operational pss were summarised and changes in the seepage analysis results with varied values of r were investigated then the relationship between q and r with three influence factors was established based on numerical simulation experiments ultimately the determination method of influence zone for ps cavern and drainage system was proposed based on the regression analysis results and receivable q t the following conclusions were drawn 1 the value of r was hard to confirm with the blurry influence zone of the cavern and drainage system these commonly exist in pss the seepage analysis accuracy of the ps underground station and the prediction of ecological environmental pressure caused by the drawing groundwater level were suspicious with inappropriate values of r 2 the results for q and the groundwater level were substantially overstated with small r values and the reduction of q and the groundwater level tended to be infinitesimal when r infinitely increased the influence factors i h max and v had non linear effects on the values of coefficients a and b furthermore increased i h max and v delayed the stable tendency of the evolution of q and groundwater level within the statistical value range 3 the optimal value of r could be the same as the value of the influence zone calculated by the proposed method the influence of the groundwater drawdown in the constant water head boundary condition could be counteracted and the seepage analysis error caused by inappropriate r values could be eliminated additionally the range of the groundwater depression cone could be directly predicted using the proposed method credit
